2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Disease or condition 
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, caused by mutations in 
the TSC genes TSC1 and TSC2, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively (Rosset 
2017). The mutations lead to constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
signalling pathway, resulting in abnormal proliferation, differentiation, and migration of cells (Fogel 
2015). This causes the appearance of benign tumours, so-called hamartomas, in different tissues and 
organs which can, through their continued growth, damage the affected tissues/organs.  
Epidemiology 
Prevalence of TSC in Europe is estimated as 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 11,300 (National Organization for Rare 
Disorders, NORD 2019). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The onset of signs and symptoms of TSC is typically shortly after birth. The signs, symptoms, and 
severity of TSC vary greatly between patients, in part due to the question which organ systems are 
affected and how strongly, from patients being symptom-less to patients in whom hamartomas lead to 
organ obstruction and haemorrhage and affect organ function (NORD 2019). Nearly all patients with 
TSC develop skin abnormalities, including angiofibromas (AFs), hypomelanotic macules, shagreen 
patches, fibrous plaques, and ungula fibromas. 
AF presents as small papules or red spots primarily on the face, often in a butterfly pattern, and may 
first appear in patients aged 3 to 5 years. Untreated, the lesions increase in size and number over time 
and through adolescence. In adulthood, the lesions tend to be stable or to grow more slowly. Facial 
AFs do not affect physiological functioning. However, case studies of patients with serious 
disfigurement and impaired physiological functions of breathing, eating, speaking, or vision, have been 
reported (Earnest 2003; Kacerovska 2012). Thus, although facial AFs are benign they may have a 
considerable psychological impact on patients, causing emotional distress and social 
isolation/marginalisation, as well as physiological impact in some patients (Knoepfel 2014). 
In 2012, the International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference developed revised 
diagnostic criteria for TSC, including 11 major and six minor features. The dermatological features 
outlined in these criteria include AF, fibrous cephalic plaques, hypopigmented macules, ungual 
fibromas, and shagreen patches (major) as well as Confetti skin lesions (minor). Hypopigmented 
macules are seen at birth, while facial AF, fibrous cephalic plaques, and shagreen patches are observed 
beginning in early childhood. Ungual fibromas manifest during adolescence or adulthood.

Management 
The direct implication of the mTOR pathway in the TSC pathogenesis has prompted the use of mTOR 
inhibitors to palliate skin and systemic manifestations. However apart from mTOR inhibitor use, the 
existing treatment options are invasive and painful and include dermabrasion, laser therapy, excision 
of lesions, radiofrequency ablation, and electrocoagulation (Salido-Vallejo 2014b). These modalities 
can yield good results, especially with severe facial AFs, but they also carry the risk of complications 
from general anaesthesia, as well as hypertrophic scars, pigmentation disorders, and postoperative 
infections. AF tends to recur after treatment cessation (Schwartz 2007). Topical sirolimus was started 
to be used for the treatment of AF after early reports on improvements in AF as ‘side-effect’ of oral 
sirolimus treatment. 
Given that no commercialised topical sirolimus preparations exist in Europe or North America, 
compounds of different concentrations have generally been developed by crushing and sifting 
commercially available sirolimus tablets (Rapamune), later also by using sirolimus in powder form. 
About the product 
This centralised application concerns a hybrid application according to article 10(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC Hyftor (gel containing 0.2 % sirolimus as active substance). The reference medicinal 
product is Rapamune (EU/1/01/171), which was first approved in the European Union on 13 March 
2001. 
Rapamune is authorised for the prevention of rejection reactions to transplanted kidneys as well as 
treatment of sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Both indications require systemic availability of the 
active substance sirolimus, either to inhibit T-cells and in consequence cause suppression of the 
immune system, or to inhibit the activated mTOR pathway and thus the proliferation of LAM cells. 
In contrast, Hyftor is intended for the treatment of angiofibroma in patients with TSC. The product is 
locally administered and acts locally. Lower levels of systemic exposure with topical sirolimus are 
observed in comparison to oral formulations. For this reason, only data are referenced that are in 
context with systemic exposure. These are in particular some PK/PD effects (such as metabolism and 
excretion of sirolimus) and some safety considerations. All clinical and non-clinical data referring to use 
in AF/TSC and topical administration in general have been generated by the applicant. 
The applicant’s bridging approach i.e. the use of data from the reference medicinal product for the 
evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and safety of sirolimus gel, 
0.2% is summarised in Table 1 below: 
Table 1: Reference data from Rapamune and specific data obtained with Hyftor in the clinical 
development program.

Mechanism of action 
TSC is a result of the constitutive activation of mTORC1 caused by defects, or mutations, of the responsible 
genes TSC1 or TSC2. 
Sirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor, although the exact mechanism of action of sirolimus in the treatment of 
angiofibroma in the tuberous sclerosis complex is not exactly known. 
In general, sirolimus inhibits activation of mTOR which is a serine/threonine protein kinase that 
belongs to the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family and regulates cellular 
metabolism, growth and proliferation. In cells, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin, FK Binding Protein-
12 (FKBP-12), to generate an immunosuppressive complex. This complex binds to and inhibits the 
activation of mTOR. 
Initially, the claimed indication was: 
The treatment of angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in adults and children. 
The final approved indication is: 
The treatment of facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in adults and 
paediatric patients aged 6 years and older

Posology:  
This medicinal product should be applied to the affected area twice daily (in the morning and at 
bedtime). The application should be limited to skin areas with angiofibroma. 
A dose of 125 mg gel (or 0.5 cm gel, corresponding to 0.25 mg sirolimus) should be administered per 
50 cm2 lesion in the face.  
The maximum recommended daily dose in the face is:  
• 
Patients aged 6-11 years should apply up to 600 mg gel (1.2 mg sirolimus), corresponding to 
approximately 2 cm gel strand per day.  
• 
Patients aged ≥ 12 years should apply up to 800 mg gel (1.6 mg sirolimus), corresponding to 
approximately 2.5 cm gel strand per day.  
The dose should be equally divided for two administrations. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
GMP 
No inspections of the drug substance manufacturing site, the drug product manufacturing site or the 
batch release site are considered necessary. 
Satisfactory notification of GMP compliance and a compliance inspection report have been provided by 
a Japanese authority for the manufacturing site located in Japan, which is responsible for drug product 
manufacturing, quality control, primary packaging, storage and distribution to secondary packaging 
site. Accepted following the MRA with the EU. 
Satisfactory MA and GMP compliance certificates have been provided for the manufacturing site located 
in the EU, which is responsible for secondary packaging and batch release. 
GLP 
The toxicology program followed ICH guideline M3(R2). All pivotal toxicity studies were conducted in 
compliance with GLP regulations, but the validation of the bioanalytical methods for these pivotal 
studies was apparently not conducted under GLP conditions. In addition to the nonclinical studies 
conducted by Nobelpharma, the Applicant relies on nonclinical data for the EU-approved medicinal 
product Rapamune and on information in the published literature to support a hybrid Marketing 
Authorization Application (MAA) according to Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
GCP 
As stated by the applicant, clinical trials submitted as part of this application, carried out outside the 
European Union meet the ethical requirements of Directive EC/2001/20/EC and were performed in 
compliance with the ICH Guideline E6 (R2) for Good Clinical Practice. There are no indications that the 
conduct of these trials deviated from the principles of GCP 
QA statement of audits assuring compliance to GCP/GLP was issued by Head-QA.

2.2.2.  Active substance 
2.2.2.1.  General Information 
The chemical name of sirolimus (rapamycin) is 
(3S,6R,7E,9R,10R,12R,14S,15E,17E,19E,21S,23S,26R,27R,34AS)-
9,10,12,13,14,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,32,33,34,34A-hexadecahydro-9,27-dihydroxy-3-((1R)-2-
((1S,3R,4R)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycyclohexyl)-1-methyl ethyl)-10,21-dimethoxy-6,8,12,14,20,26-
hexamethyl-23,27-epoxy-3H-pyrido(2,1-C)-(1,4)oxaazacyclo-hentriacontine-1,5,11,28,29-
(4H,6H,31H)-pentone corresponding to the molecular formula C51H79NO13. It has a relative molecular 
mass of 914.17 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of sirolimus was elucidated by a combination of 1H-NMR Spectrum, 13C-NMR 
Spectrum, IR Spectrum, UV Spectrum, Mass Spectrum, Elemental Analysis, and X-ray diffraction. The 
solid state properties of the active substance were measured by XRD. 
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline powder, hygroscopic, freely soluble in acetone, 
methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate and isopropyl ether; very sparingly soluble in hexane, practically 
insoluble in water.  
Sirolimus exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 15 chiral centres, but the method of 
manufacture uniformly produces a single defined stereoisomer in the solid state. The absolute 
configuration of the stereogenic centres is ensured by the fermentative production. In solution 
sirolimus interconverts between three tautomers: A, B and C. Enantiomeric purity is controlled 
routinely in the active substance by specific optical rotation.  
Polymorphism has not been observed for sirolimus. Only one form was observed, which was confirmed

2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Sirolimus is produced by a single manufacturer. Detailed information on the manufacturing of the 
active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered 
satisfactory. 
Sirolimus is produced by fermentation of Streptomyces hygroscopicus, using well-defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. After fermentation, sirolimus is extracted and purified. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Eight specified process-related organic impurities are present in the final active substance, all of which 
can be detected by the HPLC method for chromatographic purity of the active substance.  
The existence of tautomeric forms in solution has been suitably discussed.  
Possible carry-over of reagents, possible degradants as well as possible impurities from host cells, 
media and metabolites has been adequately addressed. The company adequately discussed and 
justified how impurities are removed in different stages of the process. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  double  Polyethylene  (PE)  bags,  which  are  placed  in  aluminium 
pouches lined with plastic films, together with silica gel desiccant packs. Aluminium pouches are heat 
sealed and placed in fiber drums. 
2.2.2.3.  Specification(s) 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identity (FT-IR, HPLC), 
specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), water (Ph. Eur., KF), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), chromatographic 
purity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), and residual solvents (GC).  
Residual solvents are removed from the product by evaporation and drying steps, and limits comply with 
the respective ICH Q3C limit, where applicable. . 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.  
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from 3 batches of active substance, about half the intended commercial scale, from the 
proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 48 months under long 
term conditions (2 - 8°C) and for two batches up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25°C / 
60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. A forced degradation study on one batch 
demonstrated that the active substance is prone to degradation by acid, base and peroxide, but not to 
light degradation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 15/108 
 
 
 
 
All tested parameters were within the specifications, with no significant decrease in assay or increase 
in related substances. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Hyftor 2 mg/g gel is a colourless, transparent gel.  
The product is available in aluminium tubes with HDPE closures. Each tube contains 10 g of 
gel. 
The finished product is an aqueous gel manufactured by a standard process  consisting of dissolution, 
gelling,  filling  and  packaging.  The  gel  is  packaged  in  aluminium  tubes  with  high  density  polyethylene 
closures.  
The  active  substance  has  been  sufficiently  described  including  relevant  characteristics  for  finished 
product formulation. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. Functionality-related characteristics of carbomers are considered suitable. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC.  
Appropriate compatibility studies have been conducted. 
Four formulations were developed and subjected to clinical trials.  
Considering the uncertainty on representativeness of the clinical batches used in the pivotal studies for 
the  finished  product  intended  for  marketing,  a  major  objection  (MO)  was  raised.  In  the  response  the 
applicant  provided  a  comparative  overview  of  physicochemical  properties  of  clinical  formulations,  a 
justification on sameness of formulations 2 (Phase III studies) and 3 (final commercial formulation), the 
totality of which was considered acceptable to resolve the MO.  
The finished product is manufactured by a standard process. The manufacturing process development 
has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment to identify the critical product quality attributes 
and critical process parameters. A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis 
(FMEA) method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that may have an 
influence on the finished product quality attributes. The critical process parameters and in-process 
controls have been adequately identified. 
The  primary  packaging  is  an  aluminium  tube  with  high  density  polyethylene  closure.  The  material 
complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is a standard process involving dissolution of sirolimus, gelling, filling and 
packaging. 
Suitable holding times were established.  
Process validation was performed on three commercial scale batches. Major steps of the manufacturing 
Assessment report

process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The 
in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process for a cutaneous gel. 
2.2.3.3.  Product specification(s)  
The  finished  product  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  cutaneous  semi-solid  dosage  forms: 
appearance (visual), identification (UV, HPLC), pH, related substances and assay (HPLC), minimum fill 
weight (USP), apparent viscosity (Ph. Eur.), drug release (USP), and ethanol content (GC).  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay (sirolimus) and related substances testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale primary stability batches of finished product, stored for up to 15 
months under long term conditions (2-8°C) and for up to 3 months under accelerated conditions (25°C 
/ 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Accelerated stability studies (25°C/60% RH) have shown that the finished product is stable for up to 1 
month.  
A  MO  was  raised  since  the  initially  proposed  shelf  life  of  18  months  with  storage  at  2  -  8°C  was  not 
supported by the stability data provided. The applicant adequately responded to the MO by shortening 
the shelf life to 15 months.  
One of the unspecified impurities which increased in long-term and accelerated stability studies should 
be discussed in further detail (identity and origin) – this is raised as a recommendation (REC1).  
In-use  stability  testing  was  performed  in  accordance  with  EU  guidance  (CPMP/QWP/2934/99).  The 
finished product was found stable for up to 4 weeks after opening and stored refrigerated. 
Freeze - thaw cycle studies on a commercial scale supportive batch demonstrated absence of significant 
changes after 5 freeze-thaw cycles. The applicant successfully performed additional stability studies with 
the drug product stored in a freezer at -25°C to -15°C for up to 15 months. 
A  thermostability  study  at  40±2°C  for  two  weeks  demonstrated  that  short-term  excursions  of  the 
refrigerated  storage  condition  result  in  significant  changes  in  the  finished  product  quality  and  must 
therefore be avoided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 17/108 
 
 
 
 
In addition, a photostability study conducted on product (directly exposed to light (600,000 lx.h, 25°C) 
in a tightly stoppered clear glass bottle), demonstrated photosensitivity of the finished product. However, 
the primary packaging provides sufficient protection against light influence. 
Efficacy of antimicrobial preservation in compliance with Ph. Eur. 5.1.3 requirements was 
demonstrated after 15 months storage at 2-8°C. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 15 months and storage conditions “Store in 
a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C), Store in the original package in order to protect from light.”, as stated in 
the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
2.2.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The applicant 
adequately responded to the two MOs raised during the procedure by providing exhaustive information 
and justification for representativeness of the clinical batches to the intended commercial product, and 
by shortening the shelf-life of the finished product to 15 months. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its 
manufacturing process, however, no design spaces were claimed. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertains to the need to provide a detailed discussion on one of 
the unspecified impurities, including possible origin and identity. This point is put forward and agreed 
as recommendation for future quality development  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023

2.3.  Commitment to provide a detailed discussion on one of the unspecified 
impurities in the finished product, including possible origin and identity. 
Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
TSC is a result of the constitutive activation of mTORC1 caused by defects, or mutations, of the 
responsible genes TSC1 or TSC2. 
Sirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor, although the exact mechanism of action of sirolimus in the treatment of 
angiofibroma in the tuberous sclerosis complex is not exactly known. 
In general, sirolimus inhibits activation of mTOR which is a serine/threonine protein kinase that 
belongs to the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family and regulates cellular 
metabolism, growth and proliferation. In cells, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin, FK Binding Protein-
12 (FKBP-12), to generate an immunosuppressive complex. This complex binds to and inhibits the 
activation of mTOR. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
As mentioned above, sirolimus binds to the FK binding protein 12. The resulting complex inhibits the 
activation of mTOR, which in tuberous sclerosis is caused by dysfunctionalities in the hamartin-tuberin 
protein complex. mTOR inhibition leads to suppression of cytokine driven T-cell proliferation and 
inhibition of the cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase.  
The effects of topically applied sirolimus were investigated in a TS mouse model (Rauktys et al. 2008). 
Animals received 0.8% (0.16 mg) sirolimus topically on the skin over the tumours (n = 13), 0.8% 
sirolimus topically on the skin of the back (n = 12), 0.4% sirolimus topically on the skin over the 
tumours (n = 15), vehicle control topically on the skin over the tumours (n = 12), and 0.16 mg 
sirolimus intraperitoneally (n = 8) three times per week. On Day 29, the tumour volume was 
significantly reduced in the 0.4% tumour application group, the 0.8% tumour application group, and 
the 0.8% back application group, compared with the control. Comparison of tumour volumes between 
the 0.8% tumour application group and the 0.8% back application group showed no significant 
difference on either Day 29 or Day 45. However, the p-value on Day 45 was 0.06, suggesting that 
application of sirolimus on the back may have had higher inhibitory effects on tumour volume than 
compared with direct application. 
For safety pharmacology, the applicant refers to the studies conducted with Rapamune for the 
systemic use of sirolimus that did not show any effects on central nervous, respiratory and 
cardiovascular system. The evaluation of the safety pharmacology endpoints in the toxicology studies 
(FOB in juvenile rats and ECG in monkeys) did not indicate any cause of concern. 
Secondary pharmacology and pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been carried out. 
This is acceptable since this information is available for Rapamune 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The assessment of absorption of sirolimus gel, 0.2% was conducted in an in vitro assay with human 
skin, and toxicokinetic (TK) assessments in mice, rats and monkeys. No standalone pharmacokinetic 
(PK) studies have been conducted with sirolimus gel, which is considered adequate. The in vitro skin 
permeability study with two sirolimus formulations (NPC-12G Gel 0.2% and 0.2% OSD-001) and skin 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 19/108 
 
 
 
 
samples from two human donors mounted on Franz cells showed similar permeability for the two 
formulations. The sirolimus content in the epidermis and dermis at 24 h after application of NPC-12G 
Gel 0.2% comprised 0.42% of dose. The recovery amount of sirolimus in the corneum was 2.80% of 
dose. The sirolimus content in the epidermis and dermis at 24 h after application of 0.2% OSD-001 
represented 0.34% of dose. The recovery amount of sirolimus in the corneum in this case was 2.30% 
of dose. Sirolimus was not detected in the receptor fluid collected at any time point studied up to 24 
hours after application for one skin donor suggesting that the in vitro permeability of sirolimus through 
human skin is very low. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Nobelpharma has developed sirolimus gel, 0.2% (NPC-12G Gel), a topical formulation of sirolimus for 
the treatment of angiofibroma (AF) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS). Two formulations of 
sirolimus gel of slightly different composition, OSD-001 Gel or NPC-12G Gel, have been used in the 
non-clinical and clinical studies. In order to support the safe chronic use of sirolimus gel in patients 
with AF associated with TS, one single dose toxicity study was conducted in rats and a number of 
dermal repeat-dose toxicities were conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Further studies 
included a medium-term carcinogenicity in mice, local tolerance studies including skin irritation, eye 
irritation and skin sensitization studies, as well as photosafety studies evaluating phototoxicity and 
photoallergy of NPC-12G Gel. In addition to the studies conducted by Nobelpharma, the Applicant 
relied on non-clinical data for the EU-approved medicinal product Rapamune and on information in the 
published literature to support a hybrid Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) according to Article 
10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.3.4.1.  Single dose toxicity  
The single dose toxicity study evaluated the potential acute toxicity of sirolimus gel (NPC- 12G Gel) in 
SD rats when administered percutaneously twice within 24 hours (with a 6-hour interval). No death 
occurred, and no treatment-related abnormalities were noted in the animals’ physical condition, body 
weights or gross pathology. It’s therefore agreed that sirolimus gel up to 0.8% (8.0 mg/kg/day) did 
not induce acute toxicity.  
2.3.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted with sirolimus gel (NPC-12G Gel or OSD- 001 Gel). These 
included studies in SD Rats (13-Week Percutaneous Toxicity Study of Sirolimus in Rats with a 4-Week 
Recovery Period, 4-Week Percutaneous Toxicity Study of Sirolimus in Juvenile Rats), in HWY/Slc rat 
(13-Week Repeated Percutaneous Dose Toxicity Study of Sirolimus Gel in Rats with a 7-Week Recovery 
Period, 7-Week Repeated Percutaneous Dose Toxicity Study of Sirolimus Gel in Juvenile Rats) and 
Cynomolgus monkeys (13-Week Percutaneous Toxicity Study of Sirolimus in Monkeys with a 4-Week 
Recovery Period, 39-Week Repeated Percutaneous Dose Toxicity Study of Sirolimus (for external use) 
in Cynomolgus Monkeys). 
Target organs in rats (HWY/SLC and SD rats) were the lungs, adrenals, lymph nodes and thymus 
predominantly at the highest dose tested. More adverse effects were observed with the OSD-001 gel 
formation and as a consequence the NOAEL in the study with the OSD-001 Gel formation was marked 
lower compared to the NPC12G-Gel formation. Since both formulations included 0.2% sirolimus, the 
effects might be attributed to the different rat strains or to the excipients which were not included in 
the NPC12G Gel. 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 20/108 
 
 
 
 
No abnormalities were noted after administration of sirolimus gel (NPC12G gel) in monkeys for 13-
weeks. However, after 39 weeks of treatment adverse effects were noted in GI tract (soft stool, 
diarrhoea), kidney (eosinophilic/brown granule in the proximal tubular epithelium of the kidney in 
males and females at the 4.0 mg/kg/day and in females at 1.0 mg/kg/day group) and adrenals. 
Further changes such as high glucose content in urine or haematology and clinical chemistry changes 
showed no dose dependency and occurred in individual animals only. 
In cynomolgus monkeys treated twice daily with 2 mg/g and 8 mg/g sirolimus gel for 9 months toxic 
effects were observed in one male at 8 mg/g gel and one female at 2 mg/g gel at exposure levels 
similar to clinical exposure levels following systemic administration of sirolimus and with possible 
relevance to clinical use, were as follows: typhlitis, colitis, and rectitis, vacuolation of the renal 
proximal tubular epithelium, dilation of distal tubule and collecting ducts, enlargement of the adrenal 
glands and hypertrophy/eosinophilia of the zona fasciculata, hypocellularity of the bone marrow, 
atrophy of thymus, lymph nodes and white pulp of the spleen, acinar atrophy of the exocrine pancreas 
and submandibular gland. These two animals were sacrificed for humane reasons due to deterioration 
of their general condition. 
Following systemic treatment with sirolimus, pancreatic islet cell vacuolation, testicular tubular 
degeneration, gastrointestinal ulceration, bone fractures and calluses, hepatic haematopoiesis, and 
pulmonary phospholipidosis were observed. 
No skin irritation was observed in either rats or monkeys. 
Not all non-clinical findings mentioned in the SmPC were observed after topical administration.  
2.3.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Studies on the genotoxic potential of Sirolimus (also known as rapamycin) are referred to (SmPC 
Rapamune). Sirolimus was negative in the standard battery of genotoxicity testing according to ICH S2 
(R1) comprising a test for bacterial reverse mutations, chromosomal damage in vitro in Chinese 
Hamster ovarian cells and a mouse lymphoma assays, and in vivo in a micronucleus test in mice. No 
further studies were conducted. 
2.3.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Long-term oral carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats for rapamycin are referred to (SmPC 
Rapamune; EPAR Rapamune). The studies with rapamycin were conducted for systemic use of 
sirolimus with far higher systemic exposures than reached for topical use. In mice, increased 
incidences of lymphomas (males and females), hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma (males) and 
granulocytic leukaemia (females) were observed. In rats, testicular interstitial cell adenomas were 
observed and considered most likely as indicative of a species dependent response to lutenising 
hormone levels and are usually considered of limited clinical relevance (SmPC Rapamune). Occurrence 
of malignancies (lymphoma) are expected as secondary to the chronic use of immunosuppressive 
agents. 
To evaluate any potential for skin tumour promotion of topical application a mid-term (19 weeks of 
promotor treatment) initiator promotor study for skin carcinogenicity has been performed in Crl:CD 
mice. Sirolimus gel 0.2 % and 0.8 % applied daily for 19 weeks on initiated skin did not promote skin 
tumour formation in the initiator promoter model in mice. The positive control TPA, a well know potent 
skin tumour promoter, induced skin tumour formation in all animals of the TPA group at week 12 
instead already with an increasing number of skin nodules per mouse over time. There was no 
evidence in this study for a skin tumour promoting potential of Sirolimus gel 0.2 % and 0.8 %.

EMA/119439/2023  
Page 21/108 
 
 
 
 
2.3.4.5.  Reproduction toxicity and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies conducted for the systemic use of sirolimus, also 
known as rapamycin, (Rapamune) are referred to (SmPC Rapamune; EPAR Rapamune).  
In reproduction toxicity studies using systemic administration of sirolimus, decreased fertility in male 
rats was observed. Partly reversible reductions in sperm counts were reported in a 13-week rat study. 
Reductions in testicular weights and/or histological lesions (e.g. tubular atrophy and tubular giant 
cells) were observed in rats and in a monkey study. In rats, sirolimus caused embryo/foetotoxicity that 
was manifested as mortality and reduced foetal weights (with associated delays in skeletal 
ossification). 
2.3.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Systemic exposure increased following twice daily dosing in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In 
rats treated with 0.8% sirolimus gel (to 10% of the total body surface area), AUC values were in the 
same range as for daily oral dosing of sirolimus (0.25 mg/kg/day). High AUC values were also 
observed for cynomolgus monkeys treated twice daily with 0.8% sirolimus gel (to 10% of the total 
body surface area) for 39 weeks. According to FDA/CDER Pharmacology Review(s):Application Number 
021083.NDA 21-083 are the observed AUC values in the same range as AUC values reported for 
treatment of 6 months with a toxic dose of Rapamune. However, since Rapamune was not included as 
positive control in the monkey studies, this conclusion is regarded as speculative. Further, a direct 
comparison of Cmax/AUC values between animals and humans is not feasible since specific PK studies 
in patients have not been conducted. Thus, statements about margins of exposure cannot be given. 
For clarification, the applicant focuses on Cmax data evaluated in the 39-week and 13-week monkey 
study. In the 39-week monkey study (and not in the 13-week study) 2 animals died due to 
inflammatory responses, possibly induced by sirolimus whereas no signs of toxicity could be observed 
in the 13-week study. The applicant argues that the Cmax value in the 39-week study was similar to or 
higher than mean and median blood concentrations in any age-group and at any time point in patients.  
2.3.4.7.  Local tolerance 
Sirolimus gels did not show any primary skin irritant effects in rabbits at concentrations under 0.2%. 
According to the Toxicology Written Summary, 0.2% sirolimus gel deteriorated product containing 
14.7% seco-sirolimus also had no skin irritating effects in rabbits. No skin sensitisation potential was 
noted in guinea pigs up to the concentration of sirolimus gel of 0.8%. Sirolimus gels were classified as 
moderately irritant to the ocular mucosa but these effects were attributed to an ingredient of the base.  
Sirolimus gels showed photosensitivity-inducing properties in guinea pigs, which is mentioned in the 
SmPC. Photosensitive disease-like skin reactions were dose-dependent. Sunscreen had protective 
effects when applied at challenge. 
2.3.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Juvenile Toxicity 
In juvenile rats sirolimus administered percutaneously in repeated dose studies dose-dependent toxic 
changes such as suppressed body weight gain, decreased food consumption, changes in various 
haematological parameters and tissue changes in the lymphoid organs were noted. A similar 
toxicological profile of sirolimus in juvenile rats was seen in the adult rats. The selected age ranges of 
the juvenile rats at treatment start are considered adequate for the paediatric age group to be treated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 22/108 
 
 
 
 
Nevertheless a comparison of Cmax and/or AUC values between the juvenile animals and humans is 
not feasible since specific PK studies in young patients have not been conducted. The classic approach 
for risk assessment - comparing exposure margins at the NOAELs with the human exposure is 
therefore not possible. Instead, the applicant discussed the safety of systemic exposure in juvenile 
animals; together with the fact that there are no systematic difference between younger and older 
paediatric patients in sirolimus blood concentrations, this is acceptable.  
Phototoxicity 
Sirolimus was not phototoxic in a standard in vitro 3T3 NRU test for phototoxicity. 
Studies on impurities 
Ten impurities, impurity A, B1, B2, C, D, E, F1, F2, seco-rapamycin and rapamycin isomer C, were 
tested negative with two adequate in silico models and can be considered non-mutagenic based on 
these models. 
The potential mutagenicity of impurities in NPC-12G Gel (impurity A, impurity B1, impurity B2, 
impurity C, impurity D, impurity E, impurity F1, impurity F2, seco-rapamycin, and rapamycin isomer C) 
were assessed using in silico tools in compliance with ICH guideline M7. 
In silico mutagenicity (Ames test) prediction was performed using knowledge-based Deductive 
Estimation of Risk from Existing Knowledge (DEREK) and statistical-based CASE Ultra. CASE Ultra used 
basic modules, GT1_A7B and GT1_AT_ECOLI, and reference modules, PHARM_SALM and 
PHARM_ECOLI. 
In silico prediction indicated no structural alerts of any of the tested structure. 
This is considered satisfactory. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant provided an updated environmental risk assessment including a ready biodegradability 
test of sirolimus according to OECD guideline 301F (Ready Biodegradability: Manometric Respirometry 
Test) which showed that sirolimus is not readily biodegradable. The stepwise PBT assessment was not 
continued. Therefore, a final conclusion on PBT is not possible for the active ingredient sirolimus.    
Instead of further testing on PBT the applicant referred to an European Public Assessment Report for 
the medicinal product Votubia containing the active ingredient everolimus. For legal reasons it is not 
allowed to use information published in EPARs of other applicants. Moreover, the assessor does not 
agree with the approach of the applicant to conclude on environmental behavior of sirolimus by 
similarities in molecular structure and physicochemical properties to the substance everolimus. 
According to the CHMP questions & answers document on 'Guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use' (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1) question 14, 
‘read-across cannot replace the studies asked for in the guideline on the ERA of medicinal products for 
human use’. Furthermore, a weight-of-evidence approach is not foreseen in the guideline. Therefore, it 
is not possible to definitely conclude on the PBT status of the active ingredient sirolimus. Since 
sirolimus is not readily biodegradable the next step in the stepwise PBT assessment is a study on 
transformation in water/sediment systems (OECD 308).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Topical application of 0.4 and 0.8% sirolimus to mice with tuberous sclerosis significantly increased 
survival of animals. Interestingly, indirect application produced significantly better results than direct 
application of sirolimus over the tumours. This did not correlate with slightly (not significantly) higher 
sirolimus levels in tumours upon direct application. The applicant concluded that direct and indirect 
application were equally effective. The contribution of ingestion of sirolimus ointment due to grooming 
to the systemic exposure cannot be excluded. 
LC-MS/MS bioanalytical methods for the determination of sirolimus in mouse skin as well as in whole 
blood of rats and monkeys were successfully validated. The validation was performed according to the 
Japanese standards. Although the GLP requirements were not fulfilled in full, the minimal standards 
were met and the reliability of data was confirmed by the quality assurance. 
The in vitro skin permeability study with two sirolimus formulations (NPC-12G Gel 0.2% and 0.2% 
OSD-001) and skin samples from two human donors mounted on Franz cells showed similar 
permeability for the two formulations. Sirolimus was not detected in the receptor fluid collected at any 
time point studied up to 24 hours after application for one skin donor suggesting that the in vitro 
permeability of sirolimus through human skin is very low.  
In order to underline the safety of sirolimus gel after topical administration toxicology studies were 
performed in rats and cynomolgus monkeys up to 13- and 39-weeks respectively. The NPC12G Gel 
(0.2% sirolimus) was tolerated in rats and monkeys without major adverse effects on the skin. 
Monkeys exhibited adverse effects in kidneys and the GI-tract, predominantly at the highest dose 
tested. However, these changes are known side-effects of Rapamune. Thus, the results are 
encouraging for a topical administration. However, no margins of exposure could be provided and no 
information could be provided about the behaviour of the gel in humans with angiofibroma associated 
with tuberous sclerosis. This makes a scientifically based conclusion on the safety of the gel difficult 
and the data could only be regarded as supportive. 
Sirolimus gels did not show any primary skin irritant effects in rabbits at concentrations under 0.2%. 
According to the Toxicology Written Summary, 0.2% sirolimus gel deteriorated product containing 
14.7% seco-sirolimus also had no skin irritating effects in rabbits. Sirolimus gels were classified as

moderately irritant to the ocular mucosa but these effects were attributed to an ingredient of the base. 
Sirolimus gels showed photosensitivity-inducing properties in guinea pigs, which is mentioned in the 
SmPC.  
As already known from Rapamune, Sirolimus was not genotoxic in standard battery genotoxicity 
assays and therefore no further studies were considered necessary. This is also valid for standard 2 
years carcinogenicity studies, however according to the scientific advice of CHMP to clarify any skin 
tumour promoting potential of sirolimus gel a mid-term (19 weeks of promotor treatment) initiator 
promotor study for skin carcinogenicity has been performed in Crl:CD mice and was considered 
acceptable. No evidence for a skin tumour promoting potential of Sirolimus gel 0.2 % and 0.8 % was 
observed in this study. 
Effects of sirolimus on the different stages of the reproductive process have been adequately studied. 
In most studies maximum tolerated doses were reached, but exposure levels were lower than expected 
clinical levels. Male rats treated had decreased fertility and atrophy of testes. Giant cells in testes and 
hypospermia in testes as well as in epididymides were evident. These effects on male reproductive 
organs are not unexpected with an agent with antiproliferative properties. Female fertility was not 
affected, but early resorptions, decreased uterine and foetal body weights and foetal toxicity were 
noted. In a rat developmental toxicity study no teratogenic effects of sirolimus were observed. 
However, vertebral ossification were reduced and vertebral variations were increased. In rabbits, 
treatment with sirolimus seemed related to an increase in abortions. Interactions of oral applied 
sirolimus with oral contraceptives are expected due to the involvement of CYP3A in sirolimus 
metabolism. Special studies in lactating rats showed that the compound-derived radioactivity passes 
into milk to a large extent. 
In the light of the low systemic exposure after topical administration it is not expected that clinical 
relevant interactions will occur with sirolimus gel, 0.2%. This is adequately expressed in the SmPC. 
Since sirolimus is not readily biodegradable. as further step in the stepwise PBT assessment a study on 
transformation in water/sediment systems (OECD 308). Depending on the outcome, i.e. the P criterium 
is fulfilled, a bioconcentration study according to OECD guideline 305 would be necessary. If both the P 
and B criteria are fulfilled, as final step of the PBT assessment a test on toxicity would become 
necessary 
A final conclusion on the environmental risk of sirolimus cannot be drawn based on the data available. 
A respective letter of recommendation has been provided, including an anticipated time schedule. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted support the marketing authorisation of Hyftor. The response provided 
by the applicant is acceptable. There are no more issues that need to be clarified. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
Commitment to provide a study on transformation in water/sediment systems (OECD 308) as next 
step of the PBT assessment for Sirolimus by Q1-2024. Depending on the outcome further step will be 
conducted as required, i.e if the P criterium is fulfilled, a bioconcentration study according to OECD 
guideline 305 will be conducted. lf both the P and B criteria are fulfilled, as final step of the PBT 
assessment a test on toxicity will be conducted.

The gel (doses ranging from 0.05% over 0.1% to 0.2% and placebo (vehicle only)) 
was applied to the target site twice daily (morning, evening) for 12 weeks. The 
amount of application was 1 push (approximately 125 mg) per a lesion of 50 cm2 as a 
standard, and an appropriate amount was applied depending on the size of the lesion. 
However, 1.5 pushes per application and 3 pushes per day were specified as the 
upper limits.

Table 4: Sirolimus blood concentration by patient 
As outlined in the table above, sirolimus blood concentration was detected in adults in the 0.1% or 
more groups, and the number of patients with detection tended to increase depending on the 
application period. The number of patients with detection at 1 hour after application at 12 weeks after 
the start of application was 1 of 4 patients in the 0.1% group and 3 in the 0.2% group. 
In children, sirolimus blood concentration was detected only in 1 of 4 patients in the 0.05% group 
before application at 12 weeks after the start of application, while it was detected in 2 patients before 
application at 12 weeks after the start of application and 3 patients at 1 hour after application in the 
0.1% group, 3 patients at 4 weeks after the start of application and all of 3 to 4 patients at each 
measurement time point from 8 weeks after the start of application to 1 hour after application at 12 
weeks after the start of application in the 0.2% group. 
After application, blood sirolimus concentration was detected in almost no subject at the test drug 
concentration of 0.05%, but as the concentration became higher to 0.1% and 0.2%, the number of 
patients in whom blood sirolimus concentration was detected, as well as sirolimus concentration, 
increased. The blood concentration was higher in children than that in adults at a concentration of 
0.2%.

The Applicant concluded, that as the application concentration was higher, the number of patients with 
detection of sirolimus blood concentration increased, and especially in children, the detected 
concentration was also higher. 
NPC-12G-1 
Study title 
A Phase 3 Study of NPC-12G Gel in Patients with Skin Lesions Associated with 
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 
Treatment 
Either NPC-12G gel (containing 2 mg (0.2% w/w) of sirolimus in 1 g) or placebo gel 
was evenly applied to skin lesions on the face or head twice daily (in the morning and 
at bedtime). The study medication was to be applied to the lesions of angiofibroma 
first, followed by the application to both hypomelanotic macules and plaques on the 
head (above the neck). The duration of treatment was 12 weeks (allowable duration: 
11 to 13 weeks). Follow-up observation was performed 4 weeks after the end of the 
study medication (allowable duration: 3 to 5 weeks). 
Maximum daily dose and number of tubes to be dispensed for the interval until next 
visit (about 1 month) were established by age group, as indicated below as a guide, 
which based on the assumption that the dose is 125 mg (approximately 0.5 to 1 cm 
as the length of gel extruded from the tube) per affected skin area of 50 cm2. 
For any patient whose body size (body surface area) falls largely outside the 
reference range specified for the relevant age group, the maximum dose and number 
of tubes were to be selected based not on age but body surface area of the patient.

weeks for each patient. Concentrations BLQ (0.1 ng/mL) are shown as 0 ng/mL. 
Regression curves were determined as Y= 0.2X + 0.07 (p=0.008 for hypothesis that slope=0) at Week 4, and as 
Y= 0.2X + 0.05 (p=0.140) at Week 12, were Y was the sirolimus concentration (ng/mL) and X the gel amount (g). 
Data were analysed using linear regression separately at Weeks 4 and 12. The slope parameters of the 
regression curves were identical and low (0.2 ng/mL). However, only at Week 4 (but not Week 12), 
the slope parameter was statistically significantly different (p=0.008) from 0. Based on these results, 
dose linearity could not be concluded.

A Long-term Study of NPC-12G Gel in Patients with Skin Lesions Associated with 
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 
Treatment 
Dosage and Administration 
NPC-12G gel containing 2 mg (0.2%) of sirolimus in 1 g was evenly applied to skin 
lesions twice daily (in the morning and at bedtime).If a patient forgot the study 
medication in the morning, then the patient was to immediately apply the medication 
whenever realizing the fact, as long as it occurs before dinner on the same day; and 
the patient was only to applythe medication before sleeping when it was realized after 
dinner. 
Dose 
The dose administered was 125 mg (approximately 0.5 to 1 cm as the length of gel 
extruded from the tube, or approximately 0.3 cm for investigational products with a 
manufacturing number of) per affected skin area of 50 cm2, as a rough standard, and 
should not exceed the predefined maximum daily dose for each age category as 
shown in the table below: 
Assessment report

Page 32/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If an adverse event occurred, and a dosage modification was deemed necessary by 
the  
investigator, then the dosage of NPC-12G gel (0.2%) might be decreased to 
once daily regimen (at bedtime). Dosage modification, including a case of dose 
escalation after the previous reduction, were allowed as appropriate at the discretion 
of the investigator, only when the reason for the modification was specified.

The mean blood sirolimus concentration (range) at baseline in patients with detected blood 
concentrations was 0.576 ng/mL (0.15 to 1.19 ng/mL) in overall safety population, 0.569 ng/mL (0.31 
to 0.97 ng/mL) in adults, and 0.580 ng/mL (0.15 to 1.19 ng/mL) in children. Mean baseline 
concentrations were numerically higher than mean concentrations at any other assessment time point. 
Similarly, the mean blood sirolimus concentration at 12 weeks after the start of administration was 
0.343 ng/mL (0.11 to 3.27 ng/mL) in overall safety population, 0.431 ng/mL (0.11 to 3.27 ng/mL) in 
adults, and 0.266 ng/mL (0.11 to 1.32 ng/mL) in children.  
At 26 weeks after the start of administration, it was 0.278 ng/mL (0.10 to 1.79 ng/mL) in overall 
safety population, 0.276 ng/mL (0.11 to 1.21 ng/mL) in adults, and 0.280 ng/mL (0.10 to 1.79 
ng/mL) in children.  
At 39 weeks after the start of administration, it was 0.263 ng/mL (0.10 to 1.80 ng/mL) in overall 
safety population, 0.239 ng/mL (0.11 to 0.85 ng/mL) in adults, and 0.280 ng/mL (0.10 to 1.80 
ng/mL) in children.  
At 52 weeks after the start of administration, it was 0.267 ng/mL (0.10 to 0.68 ng/mL) in overall 
safety population, 0.291 ng/mL (0.11 to 0.68 ng/mL) in adults, and 0.253 ng/mL (0.10 to 0.61 ng/mL) 
in children. 
The Applicant´s CSR concludes that there were no major differences between adults and children and 
that detected concentrations were extremely low in the majority of patients. 
Dose linearity was investigated by plotting sirolimus concentrations vs actual total daily dose. 
Additionally, data were analysed using linear regression separately at Weeks 12, 26, 39, and 52. See

Note: The mean daily gel dose was calculated as the mean gel amount/day from the total amount used for 52 
weeks for each patient. Concentrations BLQ (0.1 ng/mL) are shown as 0 ng/mL. 
Regression curves were determined as Y= 0.48X - 0.03 at Week 12 (p=0.043 for hypothesis that slope=0); 
Y=0.25X + 0.02 (p=0.028) at Week 26; Y= 0.28X + 0.01 at Week 39 (p=0.029), and Y= 0.38X - 0.05 at Week 52 
(p<0.001), where Y was the sirolimus concentration (ng/mL) and X the gel amount (g).. 
Slope parameters of the regression curves were low (range: 0.25-0.48) and were all significantly 
(p<0.05) different from a slope of 0. The data indicate dose linearity, with a flat dose-concentration 
relationship. 
Blood concentrations of more than 1 ng/mL 
Blood concentrations of more than 1 ng/mL were detected in 9 patients even at baseline before the 
start of administration of NPC-12G gel. These 9 patients were all newly enrolled in this long-term 
study.  
The Summary of Pharmaceutic Studies (module 2.7.1) states the following about blood concentrations 
of more than 1 ng/mL: 
Individual patients had values >1 ng/mL, information on these patients is summarised in the following

female. The group included the 2 patients using oral sirolimus ( (paediatric),) and 3 patient 
((paediatric)) using everolimus. It is noteworthy that most of the patients had concentrations >1 
ng/mL at some time points but values <LOQ at other time points, indicating high intraindividual 
variability in exposure.

NPC-12G-4/US 
Study design  
This was a Phase 1, single centre, open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period, PK study in healthy 
volunteers to compare systemic exposure following topical and oral dosing of sirolimus and to evaluate 
the safety and tolerability following topical dosing. A total of 12 healthy adult male or female, non-
smokers were planned to be included in this study. 
Prior to entering the trial, subjects had a screening visit to establish eligibility within 28 days before 
study drug administration. Subjects were confined from at least 10 hours before the first dosing in 
period 1 until after the last PK blood draw in period 2 (on the morning of Day 8). 
Subjects might have outings permitted during confinement at the discretion of the site staff. Outings 
were not allowed until at least 24 hours after the gel application in Period 1. Any outings from Day 2 to 
Day 8, the subjects would have avoided direct sunlight exposure to the gel application site. If not 
possible, they would have used sunscreen or worn a hat as measures to prevent direct sunlight 
exposure to the gel application site. Outings were supervised at all times by the clinical staff to ensure 
compliance with protocol and were limited to the grounds surrounding the site, as per site’s specific 
procedures for supervised outings. 
There was an in-house washout period of 5 days or more between doses. Participation of each subject 
in the study lasted approximately 8 days. 
Treatments 
Each subject was administered the following treatments: 
Treatment A (Test): NPC-12G Gel 0.2% (2 mg of sirolimus in 1 g of gel) for topical application 
(Nobelpharma Co., Ltd, Japan) Dose: A single 800 mg quantity weight (1.6 mg sirolimus) dose was 
applied to the central face on Day 1 (period 1). 
Treatment B (Reference): Rapamune® 2 mg Tablet (sirolimus) (Distributed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals 
LLC, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc, USA) Dose 1 x 2 mg tablet was administered orally on Day 6 as a single 
dose (period 2). 
For standardization purposes, no food was allowed from at least 10 hours before each dosing until at 
least 4 hours after dosing. 
For Treatment B only, except for water given with study medication, no fluids were allowed from 1 
hour before dosing until 1 hour post-dose.

Results 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the systemic exposure to sirolimus following topical 
application (NPC-12G Gel) to the central face (cheeks, forehead, chin, nose) to that observed from oral 
dosing (Rapamune® Tablet), following single administration in healthy volunteers under fasting 
conditions. 
Table 7: Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Sirolimus - PK Population 
[pg/ml values as stated in the CSR and the table above were transformed to ng/ml in the written text below by the 
Assessor] 
As indicated in the table above, PK parameters could not be calculated for Treatment A (NPC-12G Gel 
0.2% [2 mg of sirolimus in 1 g of gel]) due to an insufficient number of detectable whole blood 
concentrations (all but 3 concentrations are BLQ).  
The three concentrations observed to be above the LLOQ for Treatment A (NPC-12G Gel 0.2%) were: 
- Subject 01 at 12 hrs (0.116 ng/ml), and at 24 hrs (0.102 ng/ml);  
- and Subject 04 at 12 hrs (0.102 ng/ml). 
All observed concentrations were at least 40-fold lower than the mean Cmax from the tablet. 
Exploratory PPK analysis  
An exploratory PPK analysis was carried out based on blood concentration data from four clinical 
studies (OSD-001-001, NPC-12G-1, NPC-12G-2, and 192003). Data of 114 adults and 90 paediatric 
subjects were included in the current analysis (age range 3 to 61 years).  
A large number (56.2%) of concentrations was below the lower limit of quantification, the M3 method 
was used to handle BQL data. The inclusion of data below the quantification limit is appreciated in 
order to get a more unbiased estimation of the population PK parameters.  
The final model was a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and IIV on CL and an additive 
(fixed) and proportional residual error. Interindividual variability of the clearance was high with 91%. 
Due to more than half of the samples being below the lower limit of quantification, it was not possible 
to conduct a proper covariate analysis. Nevertheless, allometric scaling had been implemented in the 
model with fixed exponents.  
Overall, the final population PK model is able to describe the observed data and final parameter 
estimates were precisely estimated. An over-estimation of the IIV random effects was observed, which 
may be expected based on the limited experimental data available.

2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No specific studies have been performed to evaluate patient PD and/or PK/PD. 
Sirolimus gel, 0.2% is a new formulation of sirolimus, designed to deliver targeted topical therapy for 
the treatment of angiofibroma (AF) in patients with tuberous sclerosis (TS). Sirolimus is a macrocyclic 
lactone fermentation product of Streptomyces hygroscopicus with mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) inhibitory action. 
Pharmacodynamics (i.e. mechanism of action) of the sirolimus is described on data obtained from 
literature sources. This approach is considered in principle acceptable. However, Pharmacodynamic 
section of the proposed SmPC is not adequate and requires further amendments. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
To describe the PK of sirolimus after topical application, a mix of own clinical data and literature data 
have been used. In addition, the applicant makes reference to the reference product Rapamune with 
regard to distribution, metabolism and elimination as well as drug-drug-interactions and PK in special 
populations of systemically absorbed sirolimus. 
As a consequence, the PK data presented in section 5.2 of the SmPC are mainly in line with what is 
stated in the Rapamune SmPC, where applicable.  This approach is considered acceptable, as no 
differences in PK could be reasonably expected between sirolimus from oral or topical administration 
once it reached the systemic circulation. 
Different formulations have been used during clinical development and further changes to the 
formulation are proposed for the commercial product. Differences between formulations were judged 
by the Applicant to not change formulation characteristics. The justification provided is based on a 
comparison of quality attributes and assessed in the Quality part of this report. 
The results of the provided clinical pharmacokinetic data obtained in clinical studies NPC-12G1-1, NPC-
12G1-2, OSD-001-001 (patients with AF) and NPC-12G-4/US (healthy volunteers) have been cited 
above, these four studies were also the ones used to carry out exploratory population pharmacokinetic 
(PPK) analysis. 
The study design of study OSD-001-001 (“Group Titration Study in Facial Skin Lesions Associated with 
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex to Estimate the Safety and Effective Dose of OSD-001 by a Placebo-
controlled, Double-blind, Randomized, Parallel Group Design for Each Dose (Phase I/II)”), is described 
in the clinical part of this report. One of the secondary objectives was to assess the “presence or 
absence of transfer of sirolimus into the blood and the degree thereof”. To do so “blood sirolimus 
concentration before the start of application (day 0), on the first day of application (1 h), and 2 weeks 
(0 h), 4 weeks (0 h), 8 weeks (0 h), and 12 weeks (0 h, 1 h) after the start of application as well as its 
time-course changes were evaluated.”  
Of note, the maximum applied daily dose was 375 mg of the gel (“3 pushes per day”) which is less 
than the maximum applied dose in the pivotal study and its extension (NPC-12G-1 and NPC-12G-2), 
which was up to 800 mg, depending on the body surface area. 
Regarding the results, the number of patients with detection of sirolimus blood concentration increased 
with increasing concentrations of the gel administered and detected concentrations tended to increase 
with increasing concentrations of the gel administered, especially in children. 
The highest measured concentration was approximately 0.20 ng/ml and 0.25 ng/ml in adults and 
children, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 39/108 
 
 
 
 
Trough concentration seem not to differ markedly from concentrations at 1 h after treatment in week 
12, which is in line with the results of studies NPC-12G-1 and NPC-12G-2 and NPC-12G-4  showing no 
obvious correlation between “sirolimus concentration vs. time after administration” (see assessment 
below).  
The discussion on the potential impact of the measured sirolimus concentrations found in the 
pharmacokinetic studies is placed in the safety section below. 
The design of the pivotal phase III study NPC-12G-1 (“A Phase 3 Study of NPC-12G Gel in Patients 
with Skin Lesions Associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex”) is outlined in the clinical section of this 
Report. One of the secondary objectives was to assess the “sirolimus concentration in blood”. To do so 
“the blood concentrations of sirolimus were measured by the method of LC/MS/MS at Baseline, 4 
weeks and 12 weeks after the start of administration, and at the time of withdrawal.” 
The results of this study show that the mean and median sirolimus blood concentrations found at 4 and 
12 weeks stayed below 0.3 ng/ml and maximum sirolimus blood concentrations at 4 and 12 weeks 
were approximately 0.5 ng/ml and 0.4 mg/ml in adults and children, respectively. 
No clear trend regarding significant changes over time of sirolimus blood concentrations was seen; in 
addition, no clear relationship of sirolimus blood concentrations to the time after administration of the 
sirolimus gel was obvious.  
During the procedure, the Applicant provided an assessment of sirolimus concentrations in study NPC-
12G-1 by age categories of 3-5, 6-11, 12-18, and ≥19 years. As expected, the sample size in the age 
categories 6-11 and 12-18 was rather small, limiting the informative value of these data. Patients aged 
6-11 years had somewhat higher mean and median sirolimus concentrations than patients aged 12-18 
years but concentrations comparable to patients aged ≥19 years old. The data do not suggest an age-
effect on systemic sirolimus concentrations, following topical treatment with sirolimus gel, 0.2% for 
children aged 6 years and older.  
One of the secondary objectives of the long term extension study NPC-12G-2 (see clinical efficacy 
section) was to assess the sirolimus concentration in blood at baseline, at 12, 26, 39, and 52 weeks 
after the start of administration, and at the time of withdrawal. Notably, only 4 children in the age 
category 3 to 5 years have been included in the study population and therefore pharmacokinetic data 
in this study population is very limited. As structure and physiology of the skin and consequently its 
permeability for sirolimus could be reasonably expected to differ in very young children, the Applicant 
was asked to thoroughly justify the absence of PK data in the very young children below 3 years of age 
and the limited study population for the age range 3-6 years. The limited amount of paediatric patients 
below the age of 6 years is also generally of concern as further discussed in the efficacy and safety 
sections below. This issue is resolved further to the restriction of indication to patients aged 6 years 
and older. 
Blood sirolimus concentrations were detected in 9 patients already at baseline, i.e., before the start of 
administration of NPC-12G gel. Two of the 9 patients used also oral sirolimus and 8 of the 9 patients 
additionally used oral everolimus. 
Mean and median sirolimus blood concentrations found after administration of sirolimus gel stayed 
below approximately 0.3 ng/ml. Maximum sirolimus blood concentrations well above 1 ng/ml (up to 
3.269 ng/ml) were seen in 9 patients. In these patients, concentrations did not markedly increase over 
time, rather a high intraindividual variability (fluctuating profile) was seen. At 52 weeks, no patient had 
sirolimus concentrations above 0.68 ng/ml (N=88). For two of the nine patients with sirolimus 
concentrations above 1 ng/ml, concomitant use of oral sirolimus was described which could clearly 
explain their higher systemic sirolimus concentrations. Regarding everolimus, the Applicant described 
that deethoxylation of the 40th position of the chemical structure generates sirolimus and cited 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 40/108 
 
 
 
 
literature that reported that sirolimus (rapamycin) at a level of 3.0-5.2% of everolimus concentration 
was detected when everolimus 25 mg was given as single dose to patients. Therefore, everolimus use 
may also have contributed to the systemic sirolimus concentrations measured. 
Based on an assessment of sirolimus concentrations in study NPC-12G-2 by age according to age 
categories of 3-5, 6-11, 12-18, and ≥19 years, it is agreed that there is no apparent difference in 
mean/median sirolimus concentrations for children aged 6 years and older. 
Based on an assessment of sirolimus concentrations in study NPC-12G-2 by age according to age 
categories of 3-5, 6-11, 12-18, and ≥19 years, it is agreed that there is no apparent differences in 
mean/median sirolimus concentrations for children aged 6 years and older. 
Study NPC-12G-4/US was a Phase 1, single centre, open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period, PK study 
in 12 healthy volunteers to compare systemic exposure following topical and oral dosing of sirolimus 
and to evaluate the safety and tolerability following topical dosing. This study was not designed to 
show bioequivalence, as bioequivalence would reasonably not be expected and is not intended - on the 
contrary, systemic levels of sirolimus are intended to be markedly decreased or even absent with the 
topical formulation. 
The chosen dose of an 800 mg quantity weight of NPC-12G Gel 0.2% (1.6 mg of sirolimus) is higher 
than the proposed adult single dose of NPC-12G Gel 0.2% which is 400 mg (twice daily, however). 
Using a 800 mg single dose (the amount normally divided into 2 administrations in the morning and 
the evening) is regarded to be “closer to a worst case scenario” and acceptable to estimate maximal 
sirolimus concentrations expected after topical dosing of NPC-12G Gel 0.2%. Dosing of 2 mg the 
reference product oral Rapamune 2 mg tablets based on the US FDA recommended initial dose of 
sirolimus indicated for treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) according to the CSR. This dose 
is in line with posology authorised in Europe and regarded acceptable for the intended comparison 
(comparison of bioavailability). 
Blood samples were drawn prior to drug administration (pre-dose) and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 
hours post-dose. The three blood concentrations values above the LLOQ were only slightly above the 
LLOQ and found after 12 and 24 hours post dose. As concentrations were never substantially above the 
LLOQ at any time point based on these results, it could be concluded that the timing of sirolimus 
concentration measurements in relation to administration is not critical, which is in line with the results 
for studies NPC12G-1 and NPC-12G-2. In these studies, based on the figures provided, no clear 
relationship of sirolimus blood concentrations to the time after administration of the sirolimus gel was 
obvious. 
Systemic exposure to sirolimus following topical administration of NPC-12G Gel 0.2% was found to be 
far below that observed from oral administration of Rapamune 2 mg tablets in this study. 
Sirolimus is extensively metabolised by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme, and it is a substrate for the multidrug 
efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In addition, sirolimus has been shown to inhibit human liver 
microsomal cytochrome P450 CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 in vitro. In the light of the 
low systemic exposure after topical administration it is not expected that clinical relevant interactions 
will occur, but Hyftor should be used with caution in patients taking respective concomitant 
medications. Potential adverse reactions should be monitored and in case observed, treatment should 
be interrupted. 
No interactions studies with Hyftor and oral contraceptives have been performed. Low systemic 
exposure to sirolimus during topical treatment with Hyftor makes pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
unlikely. The possibility of changes in the pharmacokinetics that might affect the efficacy of the oral 
contraceptive during long-term treatment with Hyftor cannot be fully excluded. For this reason, 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 41/108 
 
 
 
 
patients should be advised to use non-hormonal contraceptive measures during treatment (see section 
4.5 of the SmPC). 
Regarding drug drug interaction (DDIs) with concomitant topical treatments, the results of the 
provided inter patient comparison are not considered adequate and as a consequence, Except for 
sunscreens, no other topical treatments should be used on the facial angiofibroma lesions while 
treatment with Hyftor is ongoing (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).  
No new DDI studies have been performed and none are regarded necessary, as possible mechanism 
for drug interactions for sirolimus have been well described, e.g. in the SmPC of Rapamune.  
In summary, the provided studies seem overall adequate to give a reasonable estimate of the maximal 
exposure to sirolimus that can be expected after topical administration. Although, with the sensitive 
bioanalytical methods developed, sirolimus can be measured in the systemic circulation after topical 
treatment with the sirolimus gel applied for, the serum concentrations are unsurprisingly much lower 
than after oral sirolimus intake. 
Sirolimus concentrations after topical administration were found to be mostly below 1 ng/ml, values 
above 1 ng/ml have only been seen in the open label extension study NPC-12G-02. Whereas dose 
linearity could not be concluded based on the results of study NPC-12G-1, study data from NC-12G-2 
indicated dose linearity with a flat dose-concentration relationship. Based on a visual comparison 
provided, no clear increase of sirolimus blood concentration in individual patients with concentrations 
above the LLOQ with increasing doses of sirolimus gel applied was observed. The Applicant 
hypothesised that most of these values in study NPC-12G-02 might be possibly explained by 
concomitant use of oral sirolimus and everolimus, which was further justified and seems plausible. 
When comparing the results of the different studies, it needs to be kept in mind that the study design 
and the study population is not completely comparable between studies: in study OSD-001-001 a 
different (lower) total dose was administered and in study NPC-12G-4/US a different dose (higher) was 
administered to healthy volunteers and not patients. Also, different formulations have been used 
(which seems acceptable, see Quality AR). 
The safety aspects related to the sirolimus concentrations found in the study population are discussed 
in the safety section below. 
Exploratory PPK analysis  
An exploratory PPK analysis was carried out based on blood concentration data from four clinical 
studies (OSD-001-001, NPC-12G-1, NPC-12G-2, and 192003). the final population PK model is able to 
describe the observed data and final parameter estimates were precisely estimated. An over-
estimation of the IIV random effects was observed, which may be expected based on the limited 
experimental data available. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The provided studies seem overall adequate to give a reasonable estimate of the maximum exposure 
to sirolimus after topical administration. Regarding distribution, metabolism excretion, DDIs, PK in 
special populations and safety of systemically absorbed sirolimus, reference is made to data generated 
with the reference product Rapamune and to published literature. This is considered appropriate as no 
differences in PK could be reasonably expected between sirolimus from oral or topical administration 
once it reached the systemic circulation. In addition, the systemic exposure to sirolimus from the 
applied gel is much lower than that obtained from orally administered sirolimus, as shown in the 
comparative bioavailability study NPC-12G-4/US.

2.4.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The clinical data package to support efficacy of 0.2% sirolimus gel for the topical treatment of AF 
associated with TSC is based on the results of the pivotal study NPC-12G-1, long-term safety study 
NPC-12G-2 and dose finding study OSD-001-001. 
NPC-12G-1 was a two-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week study in 62 paediatric and adult 
patients with TSC who had facial angiofibromas and/or other cutaneous TSC associated lesions. This is 
considered to be the pivotal study for this application. 
NPC-12G-2 was a single-arm study to primarily assess the long-term safety of NPC-12G in 94 
paediatric and adult patients with AF associated with TSC (62 of which came from Study NPC-12G-1). 
All patients received NPC-12G 0.2% twice daily as topical application to angiofibromas. Efficacy was 
assessed as a secondary outcome. 
OSD-001-001 was a phase I/II, randomised, placebo–controlled, parallel-group, double-blind dose 
escalation study in 36 paediatric and adult patients with AF associated with TSC. 
All three clinical studies were performed in Japan, in a Japanese population with TSC.

3   Including patients with composite AF improvement rated as markedly 
2.4.5.1.  Dose response study  
Study OSD-001-001 was a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study 
in patients aged 3 to 65 years with a definite diagnosis of TSC according to the Japanese 
Dermatological Association, who had ≥3 facial, red AF lesions ≥2 mm in diameter, and who were not 
suitable for or did not want to undergo laser therapy or surgery. 
Three sirolimus concentrations were tested i.e. 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.2%. The total planned sample size 
was 36, with 12 patients at each sirolimus concentration, with 2:1 randomisation to sirolimus or 
placebo for both adults and children. Patients were treated in a group titration design. At first, 6 adults 
were treated in the 0.05% group (2:1 randomisation to active drug or placebo). When the safety of the 
0.05% concentration had been ascertained, the 0.1% concentration was applied to 6 adult patients 
(2:1 randomisation). If safety of the 0.1% concentration could be shown, the 0.2% adult cohort was 
opened (2:1 randomisation). Safety of each concentration was judged by the investigator on the basis 
of data up to 4 weeks after the start of treatment. In paediatric patients, the same dose escalation 
regimen was applied, but each concentration cohort was only opened after safety of this concentration 
had been shown in adult patients. 
The primary endpoint was a composite endpoint of the degree of shrinkage and the change in redness 
of 3 AF target lesions at 12 weeks, compared with baseline. Change from baseline to 16 weeks in the 
primary endpoint, and changes in AF lesion volume and AF lesion redness were analysed as secondary 
endpoints. The tumour volume of 3 target lesions was calculated and redness of the 3 target lesions 
was estimated at baseline and week 12. The investigator or subinvestigator comprehensively assessed 
improvements in facial lesions, and the results were determined in accordance with 5 levels of 
markedly improved, moderately improved, mildly improved, unchanged, and exacerbated. All efficacy 
assessments were made by the investigator; central assessment was not in place. 
Overall, 36 patients were included (18 adults, 18 paediatric patients). Demographics and baseline 
characteristics in the study OSD-001-001 were assessed separately for adult and paediatric patients. 
As for adult patients, most patients receiving sirolimus (75%) were female and half of the adult 
patients were affected by epilepsy. In paediatric patients receiving sirolimus, age range was 6-18 
years. The majority (67%) of paediatric patients receiving sirolimus were female and 83% of patients 
were affected by epilepsy. 
According to the exclusion criteria, treatment with sirolimus, everolimus (mTORC1 inhibitor), or 
temsirolimus (mTORC1 inhibitor) within 12 months before patient registration was not allowed. 
Sirolimus gel applied to target AF lesions in the face BID for 12 weeks. Based on the application 
specifications (about 125 mg gel per 50 cm2 lesion surface; ≤3 pushes/day from the gel container), 
the total daily amount of sirolimus applied at dose concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% was 0.19 
mg, 0.38 mg, and 0.75 mg, respectively. 
Results 
Primary composite endpoint AF improvement at 12 weeks 
More patients achieved numerically greater changes in composite AF improvement form baseline in the 
sirolimus than in the placebo groups. Differences vs.placebo were statistically significant in the 
sirolimus 0.05%, 0.2% and any dose group. Shirely-Williams’ multiple comparison test indicated 
significant differences between placebo and sirolimus 0.2% (p<0.001), 0.1% (p=0.028) and 0.05% 
(p=0.011).

In paediatric patients, differences to placebo were statistically significant for all sirolimus dose groups 
and for sirolimus any dose. Shirley-Williams' multiple comparison test indicated significant differences 
between placebo and sirolimus 0.2% (p=0.003), 0.1% (p=0.036), and 0.05% (p=0.027).

The highest sirolimus dose (0.2%) tended to have the highest treatment effect on the endpoints of 
composite AF improvement, AF size improvement, and AF redness improvement, but the lowest dose 
(0.05%) did not systematically have the least effect. However, analyses were based on small patient 
numbers in each dose group, the study was not powered for these comparisons, and no multiplicity 
correction was implemented. Hence, results need to be interpreted with caution. Safety data suggested 
a dose relationship for events in the MedDRA system organ class of skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders as well as for the preferred term of dry skin and the incidence of drug-related AEs overall 
also increased with the dose. AEs were mild or moderate in intensity and were nonserious.  
Based on the result of this phase I/II trial, the concentration of 0.2% sirolimus was chosen to be 
further investigated in phase III trials.

•  Treatments 
Aqueous  gel  containing  2  mg  of  sirolimus  in  1  g  (0.2%  w/w)  or  a  placebo  gel  that  does  not  contain 
sirolimus and is indistinguishable from the test medicinal product in appearance, was evenly applied to 
lesions  twice  daily  (in  the  morning  and  at  bedtime).  The  study  medication  was  first  applied  on 
angiofibroma lesions, followed by the application to lesions of hypomelanotic macule and plaque on the 
head. 
The dose was 125 mg (approximately 0.5 to 1 cm as the length of gel extruded from the tube) per a 
lesion of 50 cm2, as a rough standard. Maximum acceptable daily dose was specified for each age range 
as shown in Table 9.

For patients who strongly deviated from the BSA expected for their age group, the upper limit of dose 
was to be defined based on BSA instead of age. 
Efficacy and safety assessments were performed at site visits which were performed at baseline; at 4, 
8, and 12 weeks (on-treatment) and 16 weeks (i.e. after a 4-week treatment free period), as well as 
at premature discontinuation if applicable and feasible. 
The duration of treatment (double-blind period) was 12 weeks (allowable duration: 11 to 13 weeks). 
Follow-up observation was performed 4 weeks after the end of the study medication (allowable 
duration: 3 to 5 weeks). 
Protocol-defined discontinuation criteria were in place and included discontinuation in case of need for 
surgical treatment of AF and failure to apply study drug for ≥8 consecutive days. The protocol did not 
define allowed dose reductions or treatment interruptions. 
•  Objectives 
Objective: To confirm the efficacy of NPC-12G gel for angiofibromas and evaluate its efficacy and 
safety for other types of skin lesions in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. 
Hypothesis: Superiority 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite improvement in angiofibromas assessed using 
photographs by the IRC (Independent Review Committee on photograph assessment) at 12 weeks 
after the start of the study medication. 
Secondary Endpoints 
The following 7 items were the secondary efficacy endpoints.  
The timing of the assessment was at baseline plus the following: 4 and 8 weeks after the start of the 
study medication and 4 weeks after the end of the study medication for item 1; and 4, 8, and 12 
weeks after the start of the study medication and 4 weeks after the end of the study medication for 
items 2 to 7. 
1. Composite improvement in angiofibromas assessed using photographs by the IRC 
2. Composite improvement in angiofibromas assessed by the investigator 
3. Improvement in the size of angiofibromas assessed by the IRC and the investigator 
4. Improvement in the redness of angiofibromas assessed by the IRC and the investigator 
5. Improvement in hypomelanotic macules and plaques on the head assessed by the IRC and the 
investigator 
6. Proportion of patients assessed as "improved" or a better category in the primary endpoint and in 
secondary endpoints 1 to 5 (proportion of patients with improvement) 
7. Change in total score from baseline for DLQI and CDLQI 
The assessments were performed by reference to the Instructions for Completing Assessments of 
Efficacy Outcomes in Accordance with the Protocol Specified Assessment Criteria. 
AF scoring criteria 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 49/108 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy assessment was the composite AF improvement, based on criteria in Table 
3.4.3.4-1, taking into account changes in AF size and extension (shrinkage, flattening, 
disappearance) and changes in AF redness. Exacerbation could be concluded based on changes in AF 
size/extension in conjunction with changes in AF redness. Consequently, the endpoint was considered 
as a composite endpoint.  
The assessment of improvements in angiofibroma shall be performed as a global assessment taking 
the significance of the size of angiofibroma and that of redness into consideration depending on the 
symptoms of individual patients.

Overall: about ≥75% of the extent of the lesion at baseline  
Nearly overall: about 50-75% of the extent of the lesion at baseline 
Partially: about 25-50% of the extent of the lesion at baseline 
Large decrease in intensity of redness: Change of ≥3 levels in redness in accordance with the Pantone® colour sample provided in 
the protocol

the protocol 
Slight decrease/increase in intensity of redness: Changes of 1 level in redness in accordance with the Pantone® colour sample 
provided in the protocol 
For  the  assessment  of  redness,  the  Pantone  colour  scheme  was  used  (Table  3.4.3.4-2).  This  was 
developed  by  Pantone  LLC  (New  Jersey,  US)  as  a  proprietary  colour  space  and  standardised  colour 
reproduction  system,  where  colours  are  described  by  an  allocated  number.  AF  redness  was  assessed 
based  on  the  Pantone  colour  scheme  with  a  score  from  1  (least  intense  redness)  to  6  (most  intense 
redness),  where  scores  were  1  for  Pantone  489C;  2  for  Pantone  486C;  3  for  Pantone  7416C;  4  for 
Pantone 485C; 5 for Pantone 704C; and 6 for tones darker than Pantone 704C.

IFA assessment 
During Scientific Advice meetings with European health authorities in 2019, it was pointed out that the 
assessment scale used for the primary efficacy endpoint in study NPC-12G-1 might not allow to quantify 
the  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect,  notably  because  of  a  lack  of  baseline  assessment.  Thus,  the 
relevance of the primary endpoint results was put into question. 
Therefore, the original photographs of the AF lesions collected for each patient in study NPC-12G-1 were 
independently  re-assessed,  using  the  alternative  Index  for  Facial  Angiofibroma  (IFA)  scoring  system, 
and  the  resultant  data  were  analysed  as  a  post-hoc  analysis.  No  new  photographs  were  taken.  An 
Independent Evaluation Committee (IEC), which was different from the IRC previously mentioned re-
evaluated all photographs. The IFA was not applied in studies NPC-12G-2 and OSD-001-001. 
The IFA is an 8-item score to assess the size and redness of AF lesions. It was developed for a sponsor 
by a clinical expert from the Department of Paediatric Neurology and Developmental Medicine, University 
Children’s Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The items and their scoring are shown in Table 13. The IFA total 
score is the sum of the item scores (or subscores); it can range between 0 and 20, with higher scores 
denoting more pronounced AF lesions (i.e. larger affected facial area, larger lesions, and darker/more 
visible lesions).

The  principal  investigator  of  the  study  performed  a  mock  assessment  of  the  photographs  to  evaluate 
improvement  as  a  post-hoc  analysis,  using  the  photographs  of  the  lesions  from  36  patients  who 
participated in the 1/2 study (NPC-12G group, 24 patients; placebo group, 12 patients) at baseline and 
at 12 weeks after the start of the study medication. Using the result of the evaluation as reference, a 
distribution of patients for each degree of improvement was prepared. On the basis of this distribution, 
the numbers of child and adult patients were calculated by assuming randomized 1:1 ratio to active and 
placebo group, tested at two-sided significance level of 0.05, and improvement score as ordinal scale. 
As a result, the numbers of patients that would simultaneously fulfil a power (1 - β) = 0.8 by subgroup 
analysis  were  17  patients  in  child  and  21  patients  in  adult,  respectively.  Considering  withdrawals  or 
dropouts,20 patients in child and 25 patients in adult, total 45 patients were required. 
Moreover, target sample size was set as 60 patients in total, to accumulate experiences in child subgroup 
as much as possible. For the primary endpoint of this study, the power in the whole study population 
(sum of adult and child subgroup) was not less than 0.99. 
•  Randomisation and blinding (masking)  
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 51/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients were randomised (1:1) to sirolimus gel, 0.2% or placebo.  
Randomisation was performed by an allocation manager using the permuted block method, stratified 
by age (adults ≥19 years vs paediatric patients <19 years). 
Blinding was achieved by using in combination with the placebo gel and the test drug that were 
indistinguishable in appearance (color, form, size, smell, surface texture of a material) and packaging 
(size, color, descriptions, print density, method of sticking labels, position of the seal). 
•  Statistical methods 
Efficacy population: Patients with definitive registration, except those who had not received the study 
drug and those for whom no information had been obtained on efficacy after the start of 
administration, were treated as the full analysis set (FAS). In this trial, both the primary endpoint and 
the secondary endpoints were analysed in the FAS. 
Safety population: All patients who had received the study drug were treated as the safety population 
(SP). 
Primary efficacy endpoint: With respect to the composite improvement in angiofibroma assessed using 
photographs by the IRC at 12 weeks after the start of the study medication (or at the time of 
withdrawal), the NPC-12G and placebo groups were compared by Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
Secondary endpoints: 
Improvements in angiofibroma assessed using photographs by the central photo-judgment Committee: 
with respect to this parameter at the following assessment time points, the present drug and placebo 
were compared by the Wilcoxon rank sum test for the adults/children subgroups: 4 weeks after the 
start of administration (or at the time of withdrawal), 8 weeks after the start of administration (or at 
the time of withdrawal), 12 weeks after the start of administration (or at the time of withdrawal), and 
4 weeks after the completion of administration. 
Composite improvement in angiofibromas assessed by the investigator, Improvement in the size of 
angiofibromas assessed by the IRC and the investigator, Improvement in the redness of angiofibromas 
assessed by the IRC and the investigator, Improvement in hypomelanotic macules and plaques on the 
head assessed by the IRC and the investigator were compared by the same methods. 
Verification of the correlation and consistency between the assessment by the IRC and the assessment 
by the investigator: With respect to the composite improvement of lesions of angiofibroma (including 
size and redness) and improvement in hypomelanotic macules and plaques of the upper neck, were 
performed by preparing a cross table for the IRC’s result of assessment and the assessment by the 
investigator. The Kendall's coefficient of concordance and rank correlation coefficient were evaluated at 
each time point for the agreement. 
“Proportion of Patients with Improvement” was defined as the proportion of patients assessed as 
“improved” or a better category (“improved” or “markedly improved”), and was calculated based on 
the improvement rated by the IRC and the investigator. With respect to the composite improvement of 
lesions as a whole and in the adults/children subgroups, the NPC-12G and placebo groups were 
compared by Fisher’s exact test in the FAS. Data that “cannot be assessed” for improvement were 
treated as “no improvement” and were included in the data to be used for Fisher’s exact test. 
With respect to change from baseline in the total score of DLQI/CDLQI at the following assessment 
time points, the NPC-12G and placebo groups were compared by the Wilcoxon rank sum test in the 
FAS and for each of the subgroups of adults, children, those not younger than 16 years (assessed with 
DLQI), and those younger than 16 years (assessed with CDLQI). 
Assessment report

With respect to change from baseline in each subscale score of DLQI at the following time assessment 
points, the NPC-12G and placebo groups were compared by the Wilcoxon rank sum test in the FAS as a 
whole and in each of the subgroups of adults and children (those not younger than 16 years and not 
older than 18 years). 
The significance level α for the test of the endpoints of the efficacy and safety were two-sided 5%. No 
adjustment for multiplicity was performed. The confidence coefficient (1-α) for interval estimation was 
two-sided 95%.

Table 17. Number of Patients in Analysis Sets and Other Efficacy Populations for Analysis of 
Each Efficacy Measure 
As a result of the case conference between Sponsor and clinical research organisation responsible for 
monitoring (intellim Corporation), the number of patients included in the analysis for hypomelanotic 
macules and the plaques on the head were 9 patients (4 patients in the NPC-12G group: 1 adult 
patient; 3 child patients, 5 patients in the placebo group: 0 adult patient; 5 child patients) and 29 
patients (13 patients in the NPC-12G group: 5 adult patients; 8 child patients, 16 patients in the 
placebo group: 7 adult patients; 9 child patients), respectively. The number of patients included in 
evaluations of DLQI/CDLQI was 26 (15 adult patients; 11 child patients) for sirolimus gel, 0.2% and 28 
for placebo (15 adult patients; 13 child patients).

Based on investigator assessment, the proportions of patients (whole population) with improvement in 
angiofibromas in the NPC-12G group were 13.3% (4 of 30 patients), 20.0% (6 of 30 patients), 23.3% 
(7 of 30 patients) and 13.3% (4 of 30 patients) at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the start of the study 
medication and 4 weeks after the end of the study medication, respectively, and the proportion of 
patients with improvement was the highest at 12 weeks after the start of the study medication. On the 
other hand, the proportions of patients with improvement in angiofibroma in the placebo group were 
9.4% (3 of 32 patients), 6.3% (2 of 32 patients), 6.3% (2 of 32 patients) and 6.3% (2 of 32 patients) 
at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the start of the study medication and 4 weeks after the end of the study 
medication, respectively. There were no significant differences between both groups at any time point. 
Quality of life (QOL) 
Mean baseline CDLQI total scores (sirolimus gel 0.2%: 1.2; placebo: 0.8) and DLQI total scores (2.1 vs 
2.4) were low, leaving virtually no option for further improvement, and comparable between treatment 
groups. Changes from baseline to post-baseline time points in mean total scores were small (ranging 
between -1.1 and 0.6 overall). There were no relevant differences between sirolimus and placebo.

Summary of main efficacy results 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). 
Sirolimus gel, 0.2% led to a statistically significant composite AF improvement at 12 weeks compared 
with  placebo,  based  on  IRC  assessment.  The  responder  rate,  defined  as  patients  with  marked 
improvement or improvement, was 60% vs 0%.

Based  on  investigator  assessment,  sirolimus  gel,  0.2%  led  to  a  statistically  significantly  greater  AF 
improvement  at  12  weeks,  compared  with  placebo  (p=0.002  by  Wilcoxon  rank  sum  test)  .Marked 
improvement or improvement was noted for 23% of patients receiving sirolimus gel, 0.2% and 6% of 
patients receiving placebo. 
The mean IFA total score at baseline was 12.1 in the sirolimus gel, 0.2% group and 9.9 in the placebo 
group. Sirolimus treatment caused a mean decrease in IFA total score of -3.5 score points, vs an increase 
of 0.5 with placebo. The difference was highly statistically significant (p<0.001).

Notes 
The endpoints were also analysed based on investigator assessment. These 
analyses are not presented above but generally showed similar results as 
analyses based on independent assessment.  
Additional analyses were done for time points other than Week 12, i.e. Weeks 
4, 8, and 16 (i.e. 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation). These showed 
generally the same trends as the analysis at Week 12. 
2.4.5.3.  Supportive study 
Study NPC-12G-2 (long-term study) 
A long-term study of NPC-12G gel in patients with skin lesions associated with tuberous 
sclerosis complex (NPC-12G-2 CSR) 
Methods 
This was a multicentre, open-label, single-arm study. 
The target sample size was at least 80, which was determined based on feasibility considerations. 
The study was intended to allow continued treatment of patients from study NPC-12G-1; accordingly, it 
allowed  the  inclusion  of  patients  who  wished  to  use  or  continue  to  use  sirolimus  gel  and  for  whom 
sirolimus gel was intended or continuous use was considered appropriate as judged by the investigator. 
Patients missing >25% of the planned doses in study NPC-12G-1 for no valid reason were excluded. 
All patients were treated with sirolimus gel, 0.2% BID at the same dose as in NPC-12G-1, with dosing 
generally defined as in NPC-12G-1. 
Visits to the study site occurred at baseline, at 4-weekly intervals through to Week 26, and thereafter at 
3-monthly intervals through to Month 12. Additional telephone visits were scheduled in the second half 
(Weeks 26-52) of the study through Month 12. Beyond 12 months, visits to the study centre occurred 
at 3-monthly intervals, with a telephone visit between on-site visits to check for AEs, status of study 
medication, and concomitant medication use. 
Study Participants  
Male or female patients aged ≥3 years with a definite diagnosis of TSC according to the diagnostic criteria 
of  the  International  TSC  Consensus  Conference  2012,  with  AFs,  hypomelanotic  macules,  or  plaques 
associated with TSC on the head. Patients could roll over from study NPC-12G-1; recruitment of new 
patients  was  permitted.  Patients  who  have  complications  such  as  diseases  unsuitable  for  the  trial 
participation, for example, uncontrolled diabetes (fasting blood glucose level >140 mg/dL or postprandial 
blood  glucose  level  >200  mg/dL),  dyslipidemia  (cholesterol  level  >300  mg/dL  or  >7.75  mmol/L, 
triglycerides level >300 mg/dL or >3.42 mmol/L) were excluded from the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 65/108 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatments 
All patients were treated with sirolimus gel, 0.2%, applied twice daily (at the same dose as in the Phase 
III study in roll over patients) to facial angiofibroma lesions, and hypomelanotic macules and plaques on 
the head (above the neck) twice daily (in the morning and at bedtime).  
In non-roll over patients, and placebo treated roll-over patients, the dose to be administered is 125 mg 
(approximately 0.5 to 1 cm as the length of gel extruded from the tube) per affected skin area of 50 
cm2,  as  a  rough  standard,  and  should  not  exceed  the  predefined  maximum  daily  dose  for  each  age 
group. 
Study  medication  was  to  be  continued  until  the  completion  of  the  study  or  approval,  while  it  was 
prespecified that efficacy data would be collected through Week 52 only. 
Objectives 
To investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of NPC-12G gel for AF and other skin lesions associated 
with TSC and to continuously provide treatment for patients with no alternative treatments.

Efficacy Results 
Composite AF improvement (IRC) 
At Week 12, the assessment time point used in the Phase III study, the improvement rate (i.e. marked 
improvement  or  improvement)  was  59.1%.  Improvement  continued  over  the  assessment  period, 
reaching 78.2% at 52 weeks. No exacerbations of AF were reported for any patient or time point.

Composite AF improvement (investigator) 
At  12  weeks,  the  composite  AF  improvement  rate  (i.e.  marked  improvement  or  improvement)  by 
investigator was 46.1%; at 52 weeks, it was 61%. This was lower than the IRC results of 59% and 78% 
at the same time points. 
Improvement rate in AF (IRC) in the overall efficacy population at 4, 8, 12, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after 
the start of administration was 19.6% (18/92), 41.1% (37/90), 59.1% (52/88), 67.0% (59/88), 73.9% 
(65/88), and 78.2% (68/87), respectively. 
In adults, the improvement rate was 14.0% (6/43), 31.0% (13/42), 41.5% (17/41), 57.5% (23/40), 
70.0%  (28/40),  and  82.1%  (32/39),  respectively,  and  in  children,  the  improvement  rate  was  24.5% 
(12/49),  50.0%  (24/48),  74.5%  (35/47),  75.0%  (36/48),  77.1%  (37/48),  and  75.0%  (36/48), 
respectively. 
Improvement rate in AF as assessed by the investigator in overall efficacy population at 4, 8, 12, 26, 
39, and 52 weeks after the start of administration was 22.0% (20/91), 28.9% (26/90), 46.1% (41/89), 
48.9% (43/88), 54.5% (48/88), and 60.9% (53/87), respectively. 
In adults, the improvement rate was 16.3% (7/43), 26.2% (11/42), 45.2% (19/42), 42.5% (17/40), 
45.0%  (18/40),  and  53.8%  (21/39),  respectively,  and  in  children,  the  improvement  rate  was  27.1% 
(13/48),  31.3%  (15/48),  46.8%  (22/47),  54.2%  (26/48),  62.5%  (30/48),  and  66.7%  (32/48), 
respectively. 
Concordance between IRC and investigator assessment 
Concordance of IRC and investigator assessments, as expressed by Kendall's coefficient of concordance, 
was moderate, with values of 0.68 at Week 4, 0.72 at Week 8, 0.68 at Week 12, 0.61 at Week 26, 0.64 
at Week 39, and 0.68 at Week 52. 
The mean total scores of DLQI and CDLQI were low at baseline (1.4 and 0.7, respectively), and the total 
scores at 4, 8, 12, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after the start of administration remained almost unchanged 
from the baseline.

2.4.5.4.  Clinical studies in special populations 
The age of the patients in the overall study population ranged from 3 to 61 years and according to the 
population PK model is considered that the results of the covariate analysis may give an indication that 
the volume in which the drug is distributed may be greater in children compared to adults. 
Because  of  the  low  systemic  exposure  of  sirolimus  after  topical  administration,  studies  in  renally  or 
hepatically impaired patients have not been conducted for sirolimus gel (see discussion in section PK). 
2.4.5.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
All efficacy evaluations supporting this MAA are presented on a per-study basis.  
No pooling of data across studies was performed due to the different design of the AF studies, notably 
the differences in duration (12 weeks in NPC-12G-1 and OSD-001-001 vs long-term in NPC-12G-2) and 
dosing  (sirolimus  gel,  0.2%  in  NPC-12G-1  and  NPC-12G-2  vs  3  dose  levels  [0.05%,  0.1%,  0.2%]  in 
OSD-001-001). 
2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant has submitted a marketing authorisation application (MAA) for sirolimus gel, 0.2% 
(Hyftor) as a hybrid application according to Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC intended for the 
treatment of angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. Of note, a paediatric 
investigation plan is not required for an MAA submitted as hybrid application. 
The proposed reference medicinal product is Rapamune oral solution/oral tablet (EU/1/01/171). Although 
both  products  contain  the  same  active  substance,  there  is  not  actual  demonstration  of  essential 
similarity.  Rapamune  is  indicated  for  the  prophylaxis  of  organ  rejection  in  adult  patients  at  low  to 
moderate immunological risk receiving a renal transplant and for the treatment of patients with sporadic 
lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) with moderate lung disease or declining lung function. 
Hyftor does not fall within the strict definition of a generic medicinal product considering the fact that 
the  pharmaceutical  form  and  route  of  administration  of  Hyftor  differ  from  the  reference  medicinal 
product.  Therefore,  (in  vivo)  bioequivalence  with  the  reference  product  cannot  be  reasonably 
demonstrated. The very low systemic absorption of sirolimus from Hyftor has been confirmed in 3 studies 
measuring PK.  
Since  efficacy  data  for  oral  Rapamune  are  not  relevant  for  the  present  application,  an  own  clinical 
development programme has been presented for Hyftor.  
Scientific bridge to the reference product 
For MAAs under Article 10(3), an appropriate scientific bridge to the reference medicinal product needs 
to be established. The type and strength of the scientific bridge needed depends on the type and amount 
of data of the reference product referred to and is a matter of scientific assessment. If a PK bridge is 
considered necessary, the comparative PK study must use an EU-sourced reference product.  
In  the  present  MAA,  the  applicant  makes  reference  to  data  of  Rapamune  regarding  distribution, 
metabolism  and  excretion,  as  well  as  drug-drug-interactions,  PK  in  special  populations  and  safety  of 
systemically absorbed sirolimus. Considering that the systemic exposure to sirolimus from the applied 
gel  is  much  lower  than  that  obtained  from  orally  administered  sirolimus  and  the  comprehensive  own 
clinical programme provided to support the different pharmaceutical form, route of administration and 
new indication, the comparative bioavailability study NPC-12G-4/US is not considered pivotal to establish 
a scientific bridge to the reference product.

The proposed indication has been restricted to patients aged 6 years and older in line with the CHMP 
recommendation and now reads as follows:  
“Treatment of facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in adults and children 
aged 6 years and older”. 
The applicant has conducted three clinical studies as part of a clinical development programme to support 
the Marketing Authorisation Application for 0.2% sirolimus gel for the topical treatment of AF associated 
with TSC; including phase I/II dose escalation study OSD-001-001 and two Phase III studies (NPC-12G-
1 and NPC-12G-2). All three clinical studies were performed in Japan, in a Japanese population with TSC.  
Ethnic  effects  might  be  mediated  by  differences  in  drug  absorption  and  systemic  distribution, 
metabolism, or excretion (ADME). However, sirolimus gel, 0.2% is administered topically and exerts its 
effect  after  dermal  absorption  directly  in  the  AF  lesions.  There  is  no  indication,  however,  that  AF 
associated with TSC would differ in a relevant manner between European and Japanese patients. Further, 
the management of AF associated with TSC is based on the recommendations of the 2012 International 
TSC Consensus Conference which is globally accepted and generally the same across regions. Therefore, 
it is not expected that topical sirolimus would act differently in European than in Japanese patients. (See 
also “Reflection Paper on the Extrapolation of Results from Clinical Studies conducted outside the EU to 
the  EU-population”,  EMEA/CHMP/EWP/692702/2008.  This  reflection  paper  indicates  that  in  particular 
extrinsic factors, such as medical practice, disease definition and study population, may influence the 
applicability  of  foreign  data  to  an  EU  setting.  These  factors  are  also  identified  in  the  ICH  E5,  which 
highlights  the  importance  of  this  guideline  in  the  planning  of  worldwide  clinical  studies).  Also,  ethnic 
differences are not expected to impact the AF scoring and evaluation. 
In order to generate data in Caucasian population, the applicant has also conducted a phase I study in 
Caucasian healthy volunteers (NPC-12G-4/US) (n=12). 
Dose response study (OSD-001-001) 
Study OSD-001-001 was a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study 
in  patients  aged  3  to  65  years  with  a  definite  diagnosis  of  TSC.  Three  sirolimus  concentrations  were 
tested (0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.2%).  
For the assessment of efficacy, a slightly different composite score was used in this phase II study to 
that used in pivotal study and long-term safety study and  all efficacy assessments were made by the 
investigator; central assessment was not in place. 
Overall,  36  patients  were  included  (18  adults,  18  paediatric  patients).  Demographics  and  baseline 
characteristics in the study OSD-001-001 were assessed separately for adult and paediatric patients.  
However,  the  groups  were  not  further  investigated  for  numerical  differences  in  the  distribution  of 
demographics or baseline characteristics given the small sample size overall and by dose group, which 
is acknowledged. However, total volume of the AF target lesions at baseline is presented (separately for 
adult and children population). Data suggest a trend towards greater AF target lesion volume in adults, 
but also a high variability in AF lesion volume between dose groups.  
Dosing in study OSD-001-001 was defined based on previous clinical studies in AF using ointment or gel 
formulations prepared from sirolimus tablets.  
According  to  results,  sirolimus  gel,  0.2%  showed  the  best  outcome  regarding  the  composite  AF 
improvement  at  Week  12.  However,  for  improvement  in  AF  lesion  size,  greatest  improvement  at  12 
weeks was seen with the lowest dose of sirolimus 0.05%, although, with no clear separation between 
sirolimus  0.05%  and  0.2%  while  both  doses  seemed  to  perform  better  than  the  0.1%  dose  level. 
Improvement  in  AF  redness  over  time  appeared  to  be  most  pronounced  with  the  0.2%  dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 72/108 
 
 
 
 
concentration,  although  differences  between  sirolimus  0.2%  and  0.05%  at  the  12-week  readout  time 
point  were  moderate.  The  applicant  has  clarified  the  reported  findings  and  argued  that  the  results  of 
treatment with sirolimus 0.05% gel on lesion size were mainly driven by a single adult patient (P-006), 
who must be considered as an outlier in this study. The same evaluation omitting the outlier provides 
rather comparable results for the 0.05% dose group and the 0.1% dose group, and a higher effect for 
the 0.2% dose group, which appears to be more reasonable.  
In a subgroup analysis according to age, treatment benefit of sirolimus gel over placebo was shown in 
adults as well as in paediatric patients. 
In general, sirolimus led to a greater composite AF improvement than placebo, for the pooled sirolimus 
doses  as  well  as  for  the  individual  dose  levels,  although  statistical  significance  could  not  always  be 
demonstrated.  However,  it  should  be  noted  the  study  was  not  powered  for  these  comparisons,  and 
multiplicity  corrections  were  not  performed.  Therefore,  results  from  statistical  testing  for  dose 
comparison should be considered with caution. 
The dose-finding  program  supporting the  dose of  0.2% twice  weekly in  the pivotal  study  seems very 
limited however sufficient enough to support the selection of sirolimus 0.2% gel as the dose to be used 
for further evaluation in the Phase 2/3 study. 
Main Study NPC-12G-1 (pivotal study) 
This study was a multicenter, stratified, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative 
study,  including  patients  aged  ≥3  years  with  a  definite  diagnosis  of  TSC  according  to  the  diagnostic 
criteria of the International TSC Consensus Conference 2012, who had ≥3 facial, red AF lesions ≥2 mm 
in diameter, and who had not received prior laser therapy or surgery (including liquid nitrogen therapy 
and phototherapy); n= 62 (30 patients in the NPC-12G group and 32 patients in the placebo group). 
Patient eligibility in this study was generally determined based on the clinical TSC diagnostic criteria. The 
placebo-controlled  design  is  considered  adequate.  Inclusion/exclusion  criteria  are  considered  overall 
acceptable.  
As  per  protocol,  only  patients  older  than  3  years  could  have  been  included  in  the  Study  NPC-12G-1. 
However,  no  patients  less  than  6  years  old  were  enrolled  in  this  pivotal  study.  Paediatric  patients 
accounted for 44% of the total trial population and were to similar proportions from age cohorts 6-11 
years and 12-18 years. The condition of facial AF due to TSC increases with increasing age and is rarely 
present in very young children Therefore, it was obviously not possible to recruit patients < 6 years into 
study NPC-12G-1. 
Since many patients enrolled in the pivotal study already had more advanced disease stages (including 
epilepsy), it is not clear why patients had to be off the systemic therapy with mTOR inhibitors for at least 
12 months (see exclusion criterion 7). The reasons why this type of therapy was not allowed during the 
participation in this study was unclear. Concerning exclusion criteria No.7, it was not discussed whether 
the  patient  population  proposed  in  the  indication  need  a  limitation  in  relation  to  concomitant  use  of 
systemic  mTOR  inhibitors  particularly  since  many  patients  use  oral  mTOR  inhibitors  for  the  systemic 
treatment of the underlining disease (i.e. TSC).  
The applicant clarified that concomitant use of systemic mTOR inhibitors was not permitted in the pivotal 
study NPC-12G-1 because the influence of oral mTOR inhibitor on the efficacy and safety evaluation of 
Hyftor should be excluded, but data on such concomitant use is available from the long-term study NPC-
12G-2 and from post marketing surveillance. Overall, the impact of the concomitant administration of 
oral mTOR inhibitors (to a certain level) on both efficacy and safety in patients with facial angiofibroma 
who  were  treated  with  sirolimus  gel  cannot  be  completely  ruled  out.  Nevertheless,  this  impact  is  not 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 73/108 
 
 
 
 
 
considered clinically relevant to the extent to influence the overall benefit/risk ratio of the product. The 
applicant does not plan to make any claims regarding concomitant use in the labelling. 
Application on the lesions of hypomelanotic macule and plaque on the head, in addition to AF lesion, was 
permitted. However, as noted by the applicant, the improvement of hypomelanotic macules on the head 
was unable to be adequately assessed because the number of patients evaluated was very small (n=9).  
The  dose  of  125  mg  (approximately  0.5  to  1  cm  as  the  length  of  gel  extruded  from  the  tube; 
corresponding to approx. 0.25 mg sirolimus) per a lesion of 50 cm2, as a rough standard, was applied to 
skin  lesions  associated  with  TSC  (including  AF).  The  maximum  applied  dose  in  the  phase  3  trial  was 
defined by age in conjunction with the assumed BSA, which is less in children compared to adults. The 
SmPC  has  been  updated  during  the  procedure  to  more  clearly  describe  the  maximum  recommended 
daily dose, and the PIL revised to reflect the agreed recommendations in a more patient-friendly way 
than originally proposed.  
The protocol-defined primary efficacy endpoint of the study is a composite endpoint of improvement in 
AF (improvement in AF size and AF redness), assessed by an IRC using photographs taken at 12 weeks 
after the start of treatment compared to baseline. Assessments were performed by investigators during 
site visits (at baseline; at 4, 8, and 12 weeks (on-treatment) and 16 weeks (i.e. after a 4-week treatment 
free period)), and additionally by an IRC based on patient photographs taken at the time of investigator 
assessments  (the  IRC  assessments  supported  the  primary  endpoint  analysis).  Composite  AF 
improvement (improvement in AF size and AF redness) as well as improvement in AF size and AF redness 
separately were assessed.  
Both AF size and AF redness are considered clinically relevant signs of AF. Improvement was determined 
using a 6-point scale ranging from ‘markedly improved’ to ‘exacerbated’, compared to the patient’s AF 
lesions at baseline. However, since this scale has not been validated and there is no prior experience of 
using this scale, there were some doubts as to the primary endpoint being adequately assessed and its 
relevance altogether.  
Therefore, the photographs of the AF lesions collected for each patient were independently re-assessed, 
using the alternative Index for Facial Angiofibroma (IFA) scoring system, and the resulting data were 
analysed as a post-hoc analysis. 
Of note, the scale used for efficacy assessment in studies NPC-12G-1 and NPC-12G-2 is different from 
the one used in the Phase I/II OSD-001-001 (which measured the volume of 3 target AFs quantitatively).  
In the pivotal study, the assessment of the AF size was not done by measuring target AFs but was done 
by  global  assessment.  Since  the  scale  does  not  provide  information  on  the  “extent”  of  the  lesions  at 
baseline and post-treatment, there is a lack of information on the absolute change in the severity of AF. 
Furthermore, 3 target AF lesions may not necessarily represent the whole picture. Assessment of the AF 
redness in both the phase I/II and phase III study was done by the same method. 
In  published  literature,  the  scales  are  reported,  which  try  to  characterise  the  AF  lesion  more 
quantitatively,  e.g.  the  FASI  (Facial  Angiofibroma  Severity  Index),  which  has  been  validated. 
Nevertheless, there is still no gold standard of a scale for assessing AF.  
For the primary endpoint, it was clarified that the scoring of efficacy assessment criteria is always based 
on the totality of facial angiofibromas, which were treated with the investigational product, not based on 
any single specific lesion.  This holds true for the assessment of size and redness of angiofibromas as 
well as for the composite change in angiofibromas.  
The information on intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were requested. For inter-rater reliability, the 
Applicant provided Kendall’s coefficient of concordance, which shows reasonable agreement between the 
raters. Demonstration of W being significantly different from 0 does not add much, only showing that 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 74/108 
 
 
 
 
there is any trend of agreement between raters which is a minimal requirement. Additional descriptive 
data on pairwise agreement between raters would have been more helpful. Intra-rater reliability could 
not be evaluated as the required data were not collected. 
Altogether, the applicant’s discussion on rationale for setting primary  endpoint is acknowledged, both 
the size and the redness of a tumour are considered clinically important therapeutic indicators for AF, 
with the shrinkage of the size of AF representing an important therapeutic goal. 
The  primary  endpoint  is  assessed  at  12  Weeks  after  the  start  of  therapy  (the  12  Weeks  is  also  the 
duration of the pivotal study). When reviewing the duration of studies from the published literature that 
reported efficacy /safety of topical mTOR inhibitors (including sirolimus), longer treatment duration such 
as 24 weeks have been reported. Furthermore, it is to be expected that a greater treatment response 
could be seen beyond week 12. This is evident from published literature, but also from the long-term 
safety study where AF improvement rate further increased until Week 52.   
The QOL was assessed by version 9 of DLQI 7 or CDLQI 8. Considering a patient population with a high 
proportion of intellectual disability, it is possible that not all patients were fully able to comprehend the 
questionnaires  and/or  to  express  their  perceived  QOL.  Furthermore,  questions  targeting  on  work  or 
schooling activities, sports, or social activities were not fully applicable to some patients who were limited 
in  their  activities  of  daily  living  by  e.g.  epilepsy  or  paraplegy/tetraplegia.  Angiofibromas  are  typically 
asymptomatic, but they can bleed, cause pruritus or pain. Therefore, e.g. the question “Over the last 
week, how itchy, sore, painful or stinging has your skin been?” might have not been relevant to many 
patients. It is considered that the DLQI/CDLQI questionnaire may not be an appropriate QOL instrument 
for TSC-related facial angiofibroma. It may not adequately capture the effect of the disease on QoL at 
baseline or a change from baseline in this patient population.  
The safety assessment principally is acceptable. The Applicant additionally clarified that in study NPG-
12G-1 no structured interview was performed to assess skin symptoms and local tolerability. 
Sample size and statistical analysis 
Target sample size was set as 60 patients in total, to accumulate experiences in child subgroup as much 
as possible.  For the primary endpoint of this study, the power in the whole study population (sum of 
adult and child subgroup) was not less than 0.99. 
The  sample  size  calculation  cannot  be  completely  reconstructed  from  the  applicant’s  description, 
however,  the  sample  size  proved  to  be  sufficient.  Overpowering  to  have  sufficient  data  in  important 
subgroups is also acceptable. 
Restricting the FAS for primary analysis to patients with post-baseline data is generally not acceptable; 
however, this is no issue as no treated patients was excluded. 
The Wilcoxon rank sum test is a valid non-parametric test for the null hypothesis that distributions of 
degrees  in  composite  improvement  in  angiofibromas  are  equal  in  experimental  and  placebo  group. 
However,  it  is  not  associated  with  an  effect  measure  for  the  treatment  effect,  which  hampers  the 
assessment of the clinical relevance of the effect and the evaluation of uncertainty of estimation. 
For  secondary  endpoints,  also  only  non-parametric  analyses  not  allowing  a  quantification  of  the 
treatment effect were provided. 
No strategy to adjust for multiple testing was pre-specified such that only the primary analysis can be 
interpreted in a confirmatory way while all secondary analyses need to be considered as exploratory.  
The randomisation was stratified by age (≤19 years, ≥ 19 years).  
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023

Replacing  missing  values  by  LOCF  is  generally  not  appropriate,  however,  all  patients  completed 
treatment and only one patient was not evaluable such that handling of missing/non-evaluable data has 
no influence on the conclusions (whereby it seems that missing data was not replaced by LOCF for this 
patient but a new degree ‘not evaluable’ was introduced).   
The assessment of consistency across subgroups is also hampered by the lack of an effect measure to 
describe the size of the treatment effect. 
Results 
In terms of age, height, body weight, presence or absence of gene diagnosis, presence or absence of 
complication (intellectual capacity disorder), presence or absence of use of pretreatment drugs (mTOR 
inhibitors, topical tacrolimus), there were no relevant differences.  
The treatment compliance rate (calculated on a weekly basis, as the number of doses during each period 
as confirmed by the patient diary, divided by the number of days in each period x 2 x 100%) for the 
overall study period was high and comparable between treatment groups (sirolimus gel, 0.2%: 96%; 
placebo: 98%). 
The composite improvement in angiofibromas in the NPC-12G group at 12 Weeks were 16.7% (5 of 30 
patients) in "markedly improved", 43.3% (13 of 30 patients) in "improved", 36.7% (11 of 30 patients) 
in "slightly improved", 3.3% (1 of 30 patients) in "unchanged", whereas the composite improvement in 
angiofibromas in the placebo group were 0% in both "markedly improved" and "improved", 15.6% (5 of 
32 patients) in "slightly improved", 81.3% (26 of 32 patients) in "unchanged", 3.1% (1 of 32 patients) 
in "no evaluation". 
The primary composite endpoint score for AF improvement at 12 weeks for sirolimus group was higher 
than for the placebo group (Wilcoxon rank sum test: P<0.001), which indicates superiority of sirolimus 
gel  to  placebo..  In  addition,  for  assessment  of  clinical  relevance,  a  responder  analysis  including  the 
difference  in  response  rates  and  corresponding  exact  95%  CI  was  provided  (although  without  the 
requested 95% confidence interval CI for the difference in improvement rates between treatment groups 
but with the 95% CI for improvement rate by treatment group). However, the response rate by treatment 
arm is also sufficient for informing B/R and inclusion in SmPC. At week 12 compared to baseline in the 
treatment group 60% and in the placebo group 0% of the patients “markedly improved” or “improved” 
in regard to angiofibroma (p< 0.001). The response rate in children at week 12 was higher (84.6% vs. 
0% [p<0.001]) than in adults (41.2% vs. 0% [p=0.003]), treatment group vs. placebo group each. 
The protocol-defined composite endpoint score for AF improvement by IRC was reassessed for the age 
categories 6-11 years, 12-17 years, and ≥18 years, including an analysis using the Stratified Wilcoxon 
(Van  Elteren)  Test,  as  requested.  There  is  a  trend  for  greater  response  in  the  young  children  (6-11 
years); 83.3% of them “markedly improved” or “improved” with sirolimus gel at week 12. In the age 
group  12-17  years  the  response  rate  was  71.4%  and  in  adults  the  response  rate  was  41.1%  with 
sirolimus  gel.  In  the  placebo  group,  the  response  rate  was  0% each  in  the different  age  groups.  The 
evaluation  of  consistency  across  subgroups  is  hampered  by  the  small  size  of  subgroups.  Although  no 
final conclusion is possible on this basis, results in subgroups are generally in line with the overall results. 
Based  on  investigator  assessment,  sirolimus  gel,  0.2%  led  to  a  statistically  significantly  greater  AF 
improvement at 12 weeks, compared with placebo (p=0.002 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). At 12 weeks, 
marked improvement or improvement was noted for 23% of patients receiving sirolimus gel, 0.2% and 
6% of patients receiving placebo. At least slight improvement was found in 70% and 31% of patients, 
respectively. 
At 4 weeks, marked improvement or improvement was noted for 13% of sirolimus patients and 9% of 
placebo patients. At least slight improvement was found in 56% and 22%, respectively. At 16 weeks, 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 76/108 
 
 
 
 
marked  improvement  or  improvement  was  noted  for  13%  of  sirolimus  patients  and  6%  of  placebo 
patients. At least slight improvement was found in 53% and 22%, respectively. The treatment difference 
was statistically significant at all assessment timepoints.  
Of note, the investigators concluded lower improvement rates with sirolimus gel, 0.2% than the IRC. 
Marked improvement or improvement with sirolimus gel, 0.2% was recorded by the IRC in 20%, 43%, 
60%, and 10% of  patients at Weeks 4,  8, 12,  and 16,  compared  with 13%, 20%,  23%,  and  13% of 
patients  according  to  investigator  judgement.  At  least  slight  improvement  at  these  time  points  was 
determined for 83%, 93%, 97%, and 67% of patients by the IRC and for 57%, 60%, 70%, and 53% of 
patients, respectively, by investigator judgement.  
Furthermore, there is a more pronounced placebo effect based on investigator assessment: Based on 
IRC review, placebo response rates (marked improvement or improvement) were 0% each at 4, 8, 12, 
and  16  weeks.  This  compared  with  9%,  6%,  6%,  and  6%,  respectively,  based  on  investigator 
assessment.  
The  Applicant  was  requested  to  summarize  the  outcomes  from  the  three  independent  assessments 
(investigator, IRC and IEC) and present information assessing the consistency between the evaluations 
of the three independent teams, Tables summarising the three different assessments (investigator, IRC 
and  IEC)  and  comparing  the  consistency  of  all  assessments  teams  using  the  FASI  and  IFA  scoring 
systems  evaluated  by  the  Kendall’s  coefficient  of  concordance  and  the  Kendall’s  rank  correlation 
coefficient were provided and the results further discussed. According to the Applicant the weaker results 
for Kendall’s correlation coefficient T, indicating weak or moderate association between assessments, 
are impacted by the outliers (defined as a discrepancy in the assessment by ≥2 ranks) that appeared in 
the comparison between investigators and the IRC. The similarity between the improvement rates of AF 
at  Week  12  between  Investigator  and  IRC  have  been  evaluated  and,  while  the  IRC  assessment  is 
statistically  significant,  a  non-statistically  significant  result  is  shown  in  the  evaluations  made  by  the 
Investigator.  
Kendall’s  coefficient  of  concordance  and  Kendall’s  correlation  coefficient  do  not  show  high  agreement 
between IRC and investigators. The reported discrepancy between IRC and investigator assessment was 
explained  by  a  different  method  of  assessment  between  IRC  and  investigator.  Since  investigators 
evaluated AF lesions while assessing the patient at the clinical site in comparison with baseline photos 
(while IRC was entirely based on photos), the investigators’ assessment may have been impacted by 
light  and/or  weather  conditions  or  also  the  failure  of  paediatric  patients  or  patients  with  intellectual 
disability to remain still during the assessments, leading to discrepancies between IRC and investigator 
assessments. 
Comparisons  of  in  situ  assessment  with  previously  taken  pictures  (Investigator  assessment)  may  be 
more unreliable than comparison of pictures taken under standardized conditions (IRC assessment).  
Overall, even if the differences in the assessment by different teams as explained by the applicant are 
acknowledged, it is somehow striking that assessment by the investigator are generally less favourable. 
Nevertheless, the effect size is still considered meaningful. 
Mean baseline CDLQI total scores (sirolimus gel 0.2%: 1.2; placebo: 0.8) and DLQI total scores (2.1 vs 
2.4) were already low. Changes from baseline to post-baseline time points in mean total scores were 
also small (ranging between -1.1 and 0.6 overall). Therefore, no improvement in QoL could be seen. As 
discussed previously, the choice of questionnaire used was most likely not appropriate for this condition 
and patient population studied. 
Based on efficacy results by age at 12 week in study NPC-12G-1, paediatric patients receiving sirolimus 
gel, 0.2% had a greater improvement rate than adults at Week 12 for composite AF improvement and 
Assessment report

improvement  in  AF  size.  No  relevant  difference  between  adult  and  paediatric  patients  was  seen  for 
improvement in AF redness. 
In addition, the composite, or global, AF improvement at week 12 is primarily in correlation with AF size 
but not with AF redness. 
Based on efficacy results by sex at 12 week, a slight trend for males receiving sirolimus to benefit more 
from treatment than females could be seen for composite AF improvement and improvement in AF size. 
Post-Hoc Efficacy Assessments 
Since  critical  issues  have  been  identified  regarding  the  instrument  for  assessing  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint in the pivotal study (that was neither validated nor there was any prior experience of using this 
scale  in  earlier  studies,  and  is  only  based  on  the  relative  change  from  baseline  rather  the  absolute 
change), the applicant decided to conduct a post-hoc efficacy analysis in addition using the Index for 
Facial  Angiofibroma (IFA)  scoring system. Despite the fact that  for  the assessment of  AF  lesions,  the 
FASI has been proposed and validated, the applicant decided to use IFA justifying this with the argument 
that smaller changes are difficult to detect with the FASI. The IFA uses a scaling of 20 points, therefore 
smaller  changes  can  be  objectified,  the  focus  is  based  on  the  angiogenic  component  of  the  facial 
angiofibromas, which causes redness and hypervascularisation of the angiofibromas as well as the skin 
(erythema). Red cheeks and “red dots” on facial skin are typically the first visible signs of AF in patients, 
and the patients complain about these symptoms, while the fibrotic component of AF generally grows 
more slowly. Further, the angiogenic component of AF typically responds better and faster to treatment 
than the fibrotic component of AF. 
However,  this  IFA  scoring  system  is  also  not  validated,  nor  used  in  any  clinical  studies,  it  is  actually 
developed for the sponsor itself. In addition, it was not a pre-specified endpoint but developed and used 
post-hoc such that the analysis needs to be considered as highly exploratory.  
Overall, the results of this additional analysis of the photographs of AF lesions using the alternative IFA 
score  showed  consistency  with  the  results  of  the  protocol-defined  primary  composite  endpoint  score. 
Patients treated with sirolimus gel achieved a significantly greater change from baseline to Week 12 in 
mean total IFA score than patients receiving placebo. Furthermore, the results were consistent across 
subgroups, including adult patients and paediatric patients. Despite an imbalance in baseline IFA score 
between the treatment groups, indicating more severe disease in the NPC-12G group in comparison to 
placebo, the treatment effect of NPC-12G is clear as is the treatment benefit when compared to placebo. 
Study NPC-12G-2 (long-term study) 
This was a multicentre, open-label, single-arm study, including patients aged ≥3 years with a definite 
diagnosis of TSC according to the diagnostic criteria of the International TSC Consensus Conference 2012 
with AFs, hypomelanotic macules, or plaques associated with TSC on the head. Patients could roll over 
from study NPC-12G-1 and recruitment of new patients was permitted.  
Per  protocol,  the  patients  with  uncontrolled  diabetes  (fasting  blood  glucose  level  >140  mg/dL  or 
postprandial blood glucose level >200 mg/dL) or dyslipidemia (cholesterol level >300 mg/dL or >7.75 
mmol/L,  triglycerides  level  >300  mg/dL  or  >3.42  mmol/L),  were  excluded  from  the  long–term  study 
(NPC-12G-2). Furthermore, the use of the reference medicinal product Rapamune has been associated 
with  increased  serum  cholesterol  and  triglycerides  that  may  require  treatment  and  monitoring  for 
hyperlipidaemia  using  laboratory  tests  is  required.  Regardless  of  the  low  systemic  exposure  after  the 
local application of sirolimus gel, given that the systemic effect cannot be excluded, the applicant was 
asked to include specific wording on the use of Hyftor in patients with hyperlipidaemia. 
The primary objective of the study NPC-12G-2 was to investigate the long-term safety.

Actually, the same efficacy endpoints as in the phase 3 pivotal study were selected for this study. AF 
improvement was assessed in studies NPC-12G-1 and NPC-12G-2 in the same manner. 
The long-term efficacy of NPC-12G (sirolimus) gel was also investigated.  
Results 
In contrast to the placebo-controlled trial (12G-1), 4 patients (4.3%) enrolled in 12G-2 were 3-5 years 
of  age.  The  concomitant  use  of  mTOR  inhibitors  was  not  prohibited,  the  concomitant  use  of  topical 
tacrolimus  preparations  was  reported  for  3  patients  (3%)  and  use  of  systemic  mTOR  inhibitors  was 
reported for 20% of patients. Evidence to support concomitant use of oral mTOR inhibitors is very limited.  
The mean treatment compliance rate in patients overall was 99%. Although due to adverse events there 
had been missed some applications, the treatment compliance can be considered as high. 
Improvement rate in AF (as assessed by the IRC) in the overall efficacy population at 4, 8, 12, 26, 39, 
and  52  weeks  after  the  start  of  administration  was  19.6%  (18/92),  41.1%  (37/90),  59.1%  (52/88), 
67.0% (59/88), 73.9% (65/88), and 78.2% (68/87), respectively. Thus, a continuous increase over time 
is observed. 
The improvement rate increased until week 52 for adults, but not for children, where it stayed relatively 
the same from the week 12 onwards. The results suggest that it takes longer to reverse larger long-
standing lesions but that even those lesions are responsive to topical treatment with sirolimus.  
Improvement rate in AF as assessed by the investigator in overall efficacy population at 4, 8, 12, 26, 
39, and 52 weeks after the start of administration was 22.0% (20/91), 28.9% (26/90), 46.1% (41/89), 
48.9% (43/88), 54.5% (48/88), and 60.9% (53/87), respectively, with an increase over time. 
A discrepancy between IRC and investigator assessment is also seen here as in the pivotal study; the 
investigators  concluded  lower  improvement  rates  with  sirolimus  gel,  0.2%  than  the  IRC  at  every 
measured  time  point.  Nevertheless,  the  improvements  are  considered  clinically  relevant  with  both 
assessments. 
The mean total scores of DLQI and CDLQI were low at baseline (1.4 and 0.7, respectively), and the total 
scores at 4, 8, 12, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after the start of administration remained almost unchanged 
from the baseline. Thus, topic sirolimus treatment for at least 52 weeks did not affect QoL. 
Of note, AF clinical studies did not include patients above 65 years of age to determine whether they will 
respond differently to sirolimus gel than younger patients. However, current published clinical experience 
does  not  suggest  any  specific  problems  that  would  limit  the  usefulness  of  sirolimus  topical  gel  in  the 
elderly. 
Wording of the indication 
During the Protocol Assistance with EMA in 2018, the applicant proposed an indication excluding children 
under the age of 3. In the present MAA, however, the applicant initially proposed the use of the sirolimus 
0.2% gel without age limit. Currently, there are insufficient data available that would justify inclusion of 
patients  below  the  age  of  6  years.  Therefore,  the  applicant  has  included  an  age  limit  for  paediatric 
population and added “facial” to “angiofibroma” in the revised indication. 
The new revised indication reads: 
Hyftor is indicated for the treatment of facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in 
adults and paediatric patients aged 6 years and older.

2.4.7.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The application is based on pivotal evidence from a single randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
supported by a long-term (safety) study (plus a Phase 1/2 dose escalation study). 
The pivotal study NPC-12G-1 and the long-term study NPC-12G-2 both investigated a single dose of 
sirolimus gel, 0.2%. Sirolimus gel, 0.2% achieved a statistically significant and clinically relevant 
improvement of AF lesions compared to placebo in terms of composite AF improvement, improvement 
in AF size, and improvement in AF redness. The primary composite endpoint score for AF improvement 
at 12 weeks for sirolimus group was higher than for the placebo group (Wilcoxon rank sum test: 
P<0.001), which indicates superiority of sirolimus gel to placebo. Furthermore, a responder analysis, 
defined as the percentage of patients who “markedly improved” and “improved” additionally reported, 
shows that at week 12 compared to baseline in the treatment group 60% and in the placebo group 0% 
of the patients “markedly improved” or “improved” in regard to angiofibroma (p< 0.001). The 
response rate in children at week 12 was even higher (84.6% vs. 0% [p<0.001]) than in adults 
(41.2% vs. 0% [p=0.003]), treatment group vs. placebo group each. 
In study NPC-12G-2, overall AF improvement over baseline could be shown to a degree that was 
comparable to that in study NPC-12G-1, with continued improvement for up to 52 weeks.  
The investigators’ assessment, however, led to lower improvement rates with sirolimus gel, 0.2% than 
the primary IRC’s assessment, the potential reasons of which have been outlined by the applicant but 
cannot be verified. Nevertheless, even the results obtained with the investigators’ assessment are still 
considered clinically relevant.  
2.4.8.  Clinical safety 
Four clinical studies have been performed with sirolimus gel, 0.2% in the AF development programme. 
Study  NPC-12G-1,  a  randomised,  placebo-controlled  Phase  III  study,  provides  main  safety  data  for 
sirolimus gel, 0.2%. Study NPC-12G-2 was an uncontrolled, open-label long-term study in patients who 
had completed study NPC-12G-1 (both sirolimus and placebo group) and 32 newly recruited patients. 
Study  OSD-001-001 was  a dose  escalation study  in  AF  patients and provides information  on possible 
dose effects of sirolimus gel. All studies in AF patients were performed in Japanese  patients. All 3 AF 
studies included adult and paediatric patients. Safety information is also available from a Phase I study 
NPC-12G-4/US in Caucasian healthy volunteers.  
Across studies, 148 AF patients and 12 healthy volunteers have been exposed to sirolimus gel. The 
total number of unique AF patients, however, is lower: all patients from study NPC-12G-1 rolled after 
study completion over to NPC-12G-2, and furthermore, due to lack of unique identifying information, it 
was not possible to track the number of patients from study OSD-001-001 through enrolment into other 
studies (it is assumed that the patients from OSD-001-001 eventually also participated in NPC-12G-1 
and NPC-12G-2). 
Sirolimus gel is also developed in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). An investigator-initiated, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study (OSD-001-003) and investigator-initiated, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II/III study (OSD-001-004) have been completed, while a Phase 
III, long-term safety study (NPC-12G-5) has been terminated.

2.4.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In studies NPC-12G-1 and NPC-12G-2, exposure was assessed in terms of treatment duration (i.e. 
from the first to the last application of study medication) as well as total gel amount used.  
In study OSD-001-001, exposure was assessed in terms of treatment duration. 
Study NPC-12G-1 
All 62 patients in the study received at least one application of study drug (Table 3.8-1).  
Mean (SD) treatment duration was 87.1 (3.5) days in the sirolimus gel, 0.2% group and 86.1 (4.1) days 
in the placebo group.  
Based  on  a  dose  concentration  of  0.2%,  the  mean  gel  amounts  correspond  to  0.12  g  sirolimus 
administered in patients overall over a 12-week period, and 0.13 g and 0.11 g, respectively, in adult and 
paediatric patients. 
Study NPC-12G-2 
All 94 patients received at least one application of study medication (Table 3.8-2).  
Mean treatment duration was 731 days (about 2 years). It was somewhat shorter in adults (682 days, 
or about 1.9  years) than in paediatric patients (774 days, or about 2.1 years). The longest treatment 
duration was 933 days in adults (2.6 years) and 951 days in paediatric patients (2.6 years). 
The mean total gel amount was 346 g for patients overall; it was highly similar between adult patients 
(341 g) and paediatric patients (350 g). This corresponds to 0.69 g sirolimus (adults: 0.68 g, paediatric 
patients: 0.70 g). 
Study OSD-001-001 
All 36 patients received at least one application of study drug. 
Overall mean treatment duration was 85 days, with no relevant differences seen between dose levels or 
age groups.

Of note, NPC-12G-2 was a long term study with up to 2 years mean treatment duration, while the other 
2 studies had planned durations of 12 weeks each. Therefore, comparison of AE incidences across studies 
should be done carefully. 
Study NPC-12G-1 
In the study NPC-12G-1 the incidence of AEs was 90% in patients treated with sirolimus gel, 0.2%, vs 
69%  in  patients  treated  with  placebo.  The  most  frequent  (>10%)  AEs  by  preferred  term  in  patients 
treated with sirolimus gel, 0.2% were dry skin and application  site irritation (each 37%), followed by 
pruritus  (23%).  Incidences  of  these  events  tended  to  be  higher  with  sirolimus  than  with  placebo, 
although  the  high  incidence  of  application  site  irritation  in  the  placebo  group  of  28%  (vs  37%  with 
sirolimus) was reported. 
No severe AEs were reported in study NPC-12G-1; all adverse events were mild (63% for sirolimus 0.2% 
and  placebo  each)  or  moderate  (27%  for  sirolimus  0.2%,  vs  6%  for  placebo).  The  pattern  of  AEs  of 
moderate intensity AEs in the sirolimus group was reflective of the overall AE profile. No AE of moderate 
intensity by preferred term was reported in >1 patient in the sirolimus arm. 
Drug-related AEs were reported in 73.3% of patients receiving sirolimus gel, 0.2%, vs 46.9% of patients 
on placebo. The most frequent (>10%) drug-related AEs in patients receiving sirolimus gel, 0.2% were 
dry skin and application site irritation (36.7% each), followed by pruritus (16.7%).  
Of  note,  28.1%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  had  application  site  irritation  judged  as  being  drug-
related.

Table 29. Drug-related adverse events; study NPC-12G-1, safety population 
Study NPC-12G-2 
The  most  frequent  (>20%)  AE  by  preferred  term  was  nasopharyngitis  (52%),  followed  by  dry  skin 
(37%), acne (35%), application site irritation (31%), and influenza (22%). 
Severe AEs were reported in 6% of patients, with preferred terms of pneumonia mycoplasmal, loss of 
consciousness,  brain  oedema,  pneumothorax,  therapeutic  embolisation,  and  corpus  callosotomy 
reported in one patient each.  
Moderate intensity AEs were reported in 49% of patients. The most frequent (>10%) moderate AEs were 
nasopharyngitis (19%), influenza (14%), dry skin (12%), and acne (11%). 
The most frequent (>10%) drug related AEs were application site irritation (31%), dry skin (28%), and 
acne (20%).

Study OSD-001-001 
In  the  study  OSD-001-001  the  incidence  of  AEs  was  58.3%  in  the  placebo  group,  75%  for  sirolimus 
0.05%, and 87.5% for each sirolimus 0.1% and 0.2%, suggesting a sirolimus concentration effect. In 
patients  receiving  sirolimus  0.2%,  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (87.5%)  were  the  most 
frequent AEs by SOC, with dry skin (50%) and dermatitis acneiform (37.5%) as most frequent preferred 
terms. Even though the patient numbers overall and in each group are small, the data suggest a possible 
concentration relationship, notably for skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and for the preferred term 
of dry skin in particular. 
A  single patient,  treated with sirolimus  0.2%,  reported a severe AE (preferred term: pneumothorax). 
AEs of moderate intensity occurred in 38% of patients each receiving sirolimus 0.05% or 0.1% and 25% 
of patients receiving sirolimus 0.2%, compared with 33% of the placebo patients. 
Data presented for the study OSD-001-001 suggest an increase in the incidence of drug-related AEs with 
the concentration. In patients receiving sirolimus 0.2%, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (88%) 
were the most frequent drug-related AEs, with dry skin (50%) and dermatitis acneiform (25%) as most 
frequent preferred terms. Despite small numbers, the data suggest a dose relationship for AEs  in the 
SOC of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and for dry skin as preferred term.

Adverse drug reactions for the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
For the purpose of the presentation of undesirable effects for the SmPC, drug-related AEs were pooled 
across the studies NPC-12G-1 (active group only), NPC-12G-2 and OSD-001-001. 4 out of 98 patients 
who  received  0.2%  sirolimus  gel  were  treated  in  study  OSD-001-001  only  and  were  not  enrolled 
thereafter in either study NPC-12G-1 or NPC-12G-2. Even though the gel formulation used in study OSD-
001-001 differed from the gel formulation used in studies NPC-12G-1 and NPC-12G-2, which chemically 
is identical to the to-be commercialized formulation, the safety data generated in these 4 patients reflect 
dermal treatment with 0,2% sirolimus. Therefore, the most comprehensive safety data will be the data 
from all 98 patients who received 0,2% sirolimus gel formulation throughout the three studies.

Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Skin irritation symptoms 
Study NPC-12G-1 
Skin irritation symptoms were identified in 80% of patients receiving sirolimus gel, 0.2% and 47% of 
patients receiving placebo. Most frequent (>10%) preferred terms in the sirolimus group were dry skin 
and application site irritation (37% each) followed by pruritus (23%).

When the analysis was limited to drug-related AEs, the incidences were 70% and 47% for the sirolimus 
and  placebo  groups,  respectively.  The  most  frequent  (>10%),  drug-related  skin  irritation  events  by 
preferred term were dry skin and application site irritation (37% each) and pruritus (17%). 
Study NPC-12G-2 
Most frequent (>10%) skin irritation symptoms by preferred terms were dry skin (37%) and application 
site irritation (31%), followed by eczema (18%), contact dermatitis (14%), pruritus and erythema (12% 
each), and acneiform dermatitis (11%). 
The most frequent (>10%) drug-related skin irritation symptoms were application site irritation (31%) 
and dry skin (28%). 
Seven patients had individual values of sirolimus in blood >1 ng/mL: of the 7 patients, 5 were adult, 3 
were female. The group included the 2 patients using oral sirolimus (NPC-06-53, 06-56) and 3 patient 
(NPC-06-53,  06-56,  08-52)  using  everolimus.  Six  of  the  7  patients  experienced  skin  irritation  events 
around the time of the high plasma levels, and 5 events were judged as being drug-related. 
Study OSD-001-001 
In this trial, different from NPC-12G-1 and NPC-12G-2, it was checked only for the 4 predefined events 
of dermatitis acneiform, dry skin, irritability, and xeroderma. Data suggest a dose relationship between 
occurrence of skin irritation events and sirolimus dose. 
Infections/ infestation 
Infections and infestations were reported in 23% of patients treated with sirolimus gel, 0.2% in study 
NPC-12G-1.  The  incidence  in  the  placebo  arm  was  similar,  22%.  Also  at  the  preferred  term  level, 
incidences  were  comparable  between  sirolimus  and  placebo.  The  only  term  reported  in  more  than  a 
single sirolimus-treated patient was influenza (3 patients), vs 0 placebo patients. On the other hand, 3 
placebo  patients  had  nasopharyngitis,  vs  1  sirolimus  patient.  Overall,  these  data  do  not  suggest  an 
increase of infection events in patients receiving topical sirolimus treatment. There were no infections or 
infestations judged as being drug related with sirolimus gel, 0.2%. 
In  study  NPC-12G-2,  infections  and  infestations  were  reported  in  71%  of  the  patients,  with 
nasopharyngitis, influenza, folliculitis, and gastroenteritis as the most frequent preferred terms. In only 
5  of  the  patients  (5%),  events  were  regarded  as  drug-related:  folliculitis  in  3  patients  (3%),  and 
conjunctivitis, furuncle, and tinea versicolour in 1 patient (1%) each. 
In study OSD-001-001, infection events occurred in 2 placebo patients (17%), 3 patients each (38%) in 
the  sirolimus  0.05%  and  0.1%  groups,  and  1  patient  (13%)  in  the  sirolimus  0.2%  group.  The  most 
frequent preferred term was nasopharyngitis (2 placebo patients, vs 3, 2, and 1 patient in the sirolimus 
0.05%,  0.1%,  and  0.2%  groups,  respectively.  Other  preferred  terms  were  herpes  zoster  (sirolimus 
0.1%: 1 patient), influenza (placebo: 1 patient), sinusitis (placebo: 1 patient), and oral herpes (sirolimus 
0.05%: 1 patient). The event of oral herpes was judged as being drug-related. 
Photosensitivity 
Overall,  4  patients  were  identified  in  the  long-term  study  NPC-12G-2  based  on  preferred  terms  :  2 
patients with solar dermatitis (unrelated) and 2 patients in whom drug relatedness of the event could 
not be excluded (drug-related photosensitivity and drug-related solar dermatitis).  
No AEs indicative of photosensitivity were identified in studies NPC-12G-1 or OSD-001-001. 
Based  on  the  findings  from  study  NPC-12G-2,  the  Sponsor  concluded  that  the  risk  of  inducing 
photosensitivity with sirolimus gel, 0.2% cannot be ruled out.

Two  SAEs  were  reported,  both  in  the  same  patient  treated  with  sirolimus  gel,  0.2%.  Preferred  terms 
were gastric haemorrhage (not related) and pancreatitis acute (drug related as per investigator). 
Patient  no.,  a  24-year  old  Japanese  male,  started  treatment  with  sirolimus  gel,  0.2%,  on,  he 
complained of black gastric residuals and abdominal distension. The family physician diagnosed 
acute pancreatitis and gastric haemorrhage, and the patient was hospitalised and fluid therapy 
was started. Study  medication was continued.  the investigator  established the cause of acute 
pancreatitis  as  compression  of  the  pancreas  by  marked  intestinal  gas  due  to  aerophagia  and 
severe constipation, but nevertheless stated that causal relationship with study drug could not 
be  ruled  out.  Pancreatitis  is  a  known,  common  ADR  of  sirolimus.  Gastric  haemorrhage  was 
considered to be unrelated to the study drug by the investigator based on clinical course, even 
though  the  cause  of  gastric  haemorrhage  remained  unclear.  The  patient  was  discharged.  The 
patient had measurements of sirolimus available, i.e. 0.368 ng/mL at 4 weeks and 0.265 ng/mL 
at 12 weeks. Of these, the concentration value at 4 weeks was closest to the date of onset of 
the SAEs.  
Study NPC-12G-2 
A total of 14 SAEs occurred in 9 patients, none of them was judged as drug related. 
Study OSD-001-001 
One SAE was reported in each the placebo group (epilepsy) and the sirolimus 0.2% group 
(pneumothorax). Neither judged as study drug related. 
2.4.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Study NPC-12G-1 
There  was  no  pattern  of  normal  baseline  values  shifting  to  abnormally  high  or  abnormally  low 
haematology or biochemistry values at Week 4 or Week 12. 
Study NPC-12G-2 
Haematology 
There was no trend of normal baseline values shifting to abnormally high or abnormally low haematology 
values at Week 12 or 52 or at the other assessment time points. 
Biochemistry 
There was no trend of normal baseline values shifting to abnormally high or abnormally low biochemistry 
values at Week 12 or 52 or the other assessment time points. Exceptions were seen for cholesterol, low 
density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides, which showed shifts from normal to high values in >5% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023

patients at most assessment time points. Maximum percentages of patients with shifts to high values 
were 13.5% for cholesterol (Week 26); 11.3% for LDL (Week 104); and 7.9% for triglycerides (Week 
26).  
To understand if the use of oral mTOR inhibitors might have contributed to these findings, laboratory 
shift tables were generated for patients with and without use of mTOR inhibitors. There was no consistent 
difference seen between these groups notably for cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. In any case, this 
comparison must be regarded with caution as patient numbers were small, notably for patients using 
oral mTOR inhibitors, and the study was not planned to detect such differences.  
‘Blood triglycerides increased’ was a preferred term in 6% of patients, but none of the events was drug-
related. Likewise, LDL increased was a preferred term in 2% of patients (drug-related 0%). There was 
no reported AE for increased cholesterol values in the SOC of investigations. 
Study OSD-001-001 
Given the small patient numbers overall and by dose group, there was no indication of a relevant pattern 
of shifts from normal baseline values to high or low values at Week 12 or at any of the other time points. 
Cardiac safety 
Cardiac safety based on ECG parameters was not assessed in the AF studies. No AEs were reported in 
study NPC-12G-1 or OSD-001-001 from the SOC of cardiac disorders. A single cardiac event was reported 
in NPC-12G-2, i.e. ventricular extrasystole (not study drug related) in a paediatric patient with a medical 
history of arrythmia which was also noted as complication of the underlying disease.

2.4.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
Age 
The age of the patients in the overall study population ranged from 3 to 61 years. No patients aged > 
65 years were treated in AF studies. 
Study NPC-12G-1 
Treatment duration was not separately analysed for adult vs paediatric patients, but data on gel amount 
suggest that adults received a higher mean total gel dose (adults: 64-67 g; paediatric patients: 54-55 
g).  
In  patients  treated  with  sirolimus  gel,  0.2%,  all  of  the  most  frequent  skin  irritation  events  (dry  skin, 
pruritus,  acne,  application  site  irritation)  were  more  frequent  (>10%  difference)  in  adult  than  in 
paediatric patients. On the other hand, influenza was more frequent in paediatric patients (23% vs 0%). 
Interestingly, in the placebo group, paediatric patients had nasopharyngitis with comparable frequency 
to influenza in sirolimus group. 
In  the  placebo  group,  application  site  irritation  and  stomatitis  were  more  frequent  in  adult  than  in 
paediatric patients. 
All of the most frequent drug-related AEs were more frequent (>10%) in adults as compared to paediatric 
patients treated with sirolimus gel, 0.2%. No relevant differences were seen in placebo treated patients, 
Assessment report

with the exception of application site irritation, which was again more frequent in adult patients (33% 
vs 21% in paediatric patients). 
Table 33. Adverse events reported in >10% of patients in any group, by age; study NPC- 
12G-1, safety population 
Study NPC-12G-2 
Mean treatment duration was shorter in adults (682 days, or about 1.9  years) than in paediatric patients 
(774 days, or about 2.1 years). Mean total gel amount was similar between adults (341 g) and paediatric 
patients (350 g). 
Preferred  terms  that  were  more  frequent  in  adult  patients  were  pruritus  (18%  vs  6%  in  paediatric 
patients) and back pain (11% vs 0%). Different from what was observed in study NPC-12G-1, there was 
no relevant difference between adult and paediatric patients for any of the skin irritation events (except 
for  pruritus).  Preferred  terms  that  were  more  frequent  (>10%)  in  paediatric  patients  were 
nasopharyngitis (62%, vs 41% in adults), influenza (34% vs 9%), and contusion (12% vs 0%). 
Incidences of drug related AEs were comparable between adult and paediatric patients.

Table 34. Adverse events reported in >10% of patients in any group, by age; study NPC-

Study OSD-001-001 
Overall,  there  appeared  to  be  no  systematic  trend  for  adults  to  have  AE  incidences  different  from 
paediatric  patients,  within  each  of  the  treatment  groups,  i.e.  placebo  (67%,  vs  50%  in  paediatric 
patients), sirolimus 0.05% (75% vs 75%), sirolimus 0.1% (100% vs 75%), and sirolimus 0.2% (75% 
vs 100%). 
Sex 
The AE profile for male vs female patients was investigated in study NPC-12G-1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 93/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Among patients treated with sirolimus gel, 0.2%, males had higher incidences of dry skin (47% vs 23% 
in  females)  and  pruritus  (29%  vs  15%);  however,  a  similar  imbalance  was  seen  for  male  vs  female 
patients receiving placebo. Female patients receiving sirolimus reported more frequently application site 
irritation (46%, vs 29% in males), however, with a similar pattern in the placebo group (33% females, 
18% males).  
In male as well as in female patients, the most frequent drug-related AEs generally occurred with higher 
incidences in the sirolimus gel, 0.2% group than the placebo group. 
Pregnancy 
The reproductive effects of sirolimus gel, 0.2% in humans have not been studied.  
No pregnancies were reported in the AF studies.  
Lactation 
Sirolimus gel, 0.2% has not been studied in lactating/breastfeeding women.  
Overdose 
A topical overdose is not likely to occur after topical administration to AF lesions. If overdose occurs, 
treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. 
Clinical AF programme of sirolimus gel, 0.2% 
The highest dose concentration used in planned clinical studies in AF patients has been sirolimus gel, 
0.2% twice daily, with a daily gel amount of 800 mg sirolimus gel, corresponding to 1.6 mg sirolimus/day 
(studies NPC-12G-1, NPC-12G-2).  
Other clinical programmes of sirolimus gel 
The highest  dose concentration used in  planned  clinical  studies  of  neurofibromatosis  type  1 has been 
sirolimus gel, 0.4% twice daily. The AE profile in these patients was in general not appreciably different 
from that in AF patients receiving sirolimus gel, 0.2% twice daily. 
Drug Abuse 
Sirolimus  gel,  0.2%  is  not  considered  to  have  abuse  potential  in  the  targeted  indication  based  on  its 
mechanism of action and safety profile. 
No dependence studies were conducted in humans or animals. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No  studies  were  performed  that  were  specifically  designed  to  evaluate  adverse  withdrawal  and/or 
rebound effects. 
Continued assessment of patients after EOT through Week 16 in studies OSD-001-001 and NPC-12G-1 
confirmed that the size and redness of AF lesions worsened after treatment cessation.

2.4.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Dedicated studies of drug-drug interactions were not performed for sirolimus gel, 0.2% (see also Clinical 
Pharmacology section).  
2.4.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No patient discontinued the 12-week studies NPC-12G-1 or OSD-001-001 for AEs, while 2 patients (2%) 
discontinued the long term study NPC-12G-2 because of AEs. The preferred terms in these 2 patients 
were eye irritation and erythema in one patient and contact dermatitis in another patient. The patients 
discontinued treatment after 15 and 29 days, respectively. All 3 AEs were mild and judged as being drug-
related. 
The incidence of adverse events and adverse drug reactions leading to treatment interruption was 27.7% 
(26/94) and 13.8% (13/94), respectively, in overall safety population of the long term study NPC-12G-
2. The incidence of both adverse events and adverse drug reactions leading to dosage modification was 
3.2% (3/94) in overall safety population. 
2.4.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Sirolimus gel, 0.2% was approved in Japan under the brand name Rapalimus Gel 0.2% on 1 Mar 2018. 
To date, sirolimus gel, 0.2% has not been authorised in another region or country. 
A  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  (PSUR),  covering  the  period  from  15  Mar  2020  to  14  Mar  2021  is 
available; PSURs of earlier reporting periods are currently not available in English language. A cumulative 
presentation  of  all  safety  data  since  the  approval  of  Rapalimus  Gel  0.2%  in  Japan  is  currently  not 
available. The above-mentioned PSUR summarised a general drug-use survey of Rapalimus® Gel. 
General drug-use survey 
A general drug-use survey of Rapalimus® Gel was started on 6 Jun 2018, i.e. the date of product launch 
in Japan, and is ongoing as an all-case survey under the conditions for approval. The target number of 
registered patients was 375 patients. Since the target number of patients enrolled exceeded 375 patients 
in this survey, the registration of patients requiring collection of case report forms in consultation with 
the Japanese regulatory authority was set to patients starting treatment on or before 30 Sep 2019, and 
the survey system was changed to a system in which only patient registration is continued for patients 
starting treatment on or after 1 Oct 2019. 
For patients in the safety analysis set, all events reported during the period of 52 weeks after the start 
of  Rapalimus  Gel  or  within  28  days  after  discontinuation  of  this  drug  were  included  in  the  analysis. 
Adverse events were classified by preferred term and system organ class on the basis of MedDRA/ ver. 
23.1. Events for which the causal relationship with Rapalimus Gel could not be ruled out were handled 
as adverse reactions. 
Of the 639 patients in the safety analysis set, 54% were female. Patients aged <15 years accounted 
for 32% of patients, while 67% were aged between 15 and <65 years, and 1% was aged ≥65 years. 
Mean (SD) duration of use was 292 (119) days; mean (SD) total dose was 47 (61) g.  
Overall, 27% of patients discontinued treatment before the end of the 52-week observation period; 
most  frequent  discontinuation  reasons  were  AEs  (n=38),  transfer  to  another  hospital  (n=37), 
recovering/resolution (n=27), lack of response (n=23), death (n=2), and other (n=54). 
The incidence of  adverse  reactions was 18%. Adverse reactions with incidence ≥1% are: acne (4%), 
application  site  irritation  (3%),  dry  skin  (2%),  application  site  erythema  (2%),  dermatitis  acneiform 
Assessment report

(1%),  and  skin  irritation  (1%).  Serious  adverse  reactions  occurred  in  one  patient  (<1%),  reporting 
application site haemorrhage. No adverse reactions leading to death were observed in this survey. 
Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 4% of patients, the most frequent (≥2 patients) 
being acne (5 patients), application site erythema and application site irritation (4 patients each, pruritus 
(3 patients), and dry skin and application site pain (2 patients each).  
Photosensitivity  was  assessed  in  detail,  searching  for  MedDRA  preferred  terms  of:  photosensitivity 
reaction,  application  site  photosensitivity  reaction,  solar  dermatitis,  and  administration  site 
photosensitivity  reaction.  Three  patients  were  identified  with  adverse  reactions  of  photosensitivity 
(<1%), all being non-serious. All of them were non-serious and the outcome was “resolved.” 
Two patients were confirmed to be pregnant during the observation period:  
a  31-year  old  Japanese  female,  discontinued  treatment  due  to  pregnancy  on  Day  77.  The  last 
menstruation  is  unknown.  The  patient  gave  birth  to  a  baby  approximately  9  months  after  treatment 
discontinuation. No abnormality in delivery or in the baby was reported.  
a  29-year  old  Japanese  female,  had  her  last  menstruation  on  Day  65  of  treatment.  On  Day  126, 
treatment  was  discontinued  at  her  request  due  to  pregnancy.  She  was  diagnosed  as  having  cervical 
incompetence on Day 49 after discontinuation and aborted due to cervical incompetence and premature 
rupture of membranes on Day 59. There were no apparent external malformations in the foetus. The 
abortin was judged as not drug related. 
Of  note,  serious adverse  reaction of  pancreatitis  acute (observed in  one  patient in  study  NPC-12G-1) 
was not observed in this survey. 
The adverse reaction which was observed not before approval but only in this survey and occurred in at 
least 1% of patients was “application site erythema” with the incidence of 1.56% (10/639 patients). 
Safety in concomitant use of mTOR inhibitors 
Since the number of patients who concomitantly used mTOR inhibitors is limited in the domestic long-
term treatment study, and Rapalimus Gel and mTOR inhibitors are expected to be concomitantly used 
in daily medical practice, the company is still collecting information on the safety and effectiveness of 
concomitant  use  of  mTOR,  This  is  done  as  part  of  the  routine  Pharmacovigilance  and  reported  in  the 
PSUR.  
2.4.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data is available from 4 clinical studies, which have been performed with sirolimus gel, 0.2% in 
the AF development programme. Study NPC-12G-1, a randomised, placebo-controlled Phase III study, 
provides main  safety  data for  sirolimus gel,  0.2%. Study  NPC-12G-2 was  an uncontrolled,  open-label 
long-term study in patients who had completed study NPC-12G-1, where treatment was continued until 
(individual) study completion or approval of sirolimus gel. Study OSD-001-001 was a dose escalation 
study in AF patients and provides information on possible dose effects of sirolimus gel. All studies in AF 
patients were performed in Japanese (adult and paediatric) patients. Safety information is also available 
from a Phase I study NPC-12G-4/US in Caucasian healthy volunteers.  
Sirolimus gel is also developed in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). 
The applicant presented the safety data on a by-study basis and argued that pooling safety data across 
AF studies was not feasible; however, pooled data was displayed for section 4.8 of the SmPC (“Adverse 
drug reactions reported from the placebo-controlled phase III and the long-term study are summarized 
in the table below by system organ class and frequency.”). 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 96/108 
 
 
 
 
Across studies, the Applicant claimed that 148 AF patients (both adult and paediatric) and 12 healthy 
volunteers have been exposed to sirolimus gel. The safety database is considered limited; however, since 
the underlying disease TSC is an orphan disease this is acceptable. 
The  uncertainty  of  how  many  individual  patient  were  actually  exposed  to  sirolimus  gel  in  the  clinical 
studies has been clarified. Since patients from OSD-001-001 eventually also participated in NPC-12G-1, 
and all patients from study NPC-12G-1 rolled over, after study completion, to NPC-12G-2, there were 
108 AF patients exposed to sirolimus gel (any concentration), and overall 98 individual patients received 
0.2% sirolimus gel in any of the three studies.  
Four  different  formulations  of  sirolimus  gel,  0.2%  have  been  used  in  clinical  studies.  The  commercial 
formulation for the EU market (formulation 4) in comparison to formulation 3 (used in LTS study NPC-
12G-2  and  BE  study  NPC-12G-4/US)  includes  a  3%  drug  substance  overage.  The  applicant  however 
decided  not  to  include  a  sirolimus  overage  in  the  gel  formulation.  In  consequence,  the  formulation 
foreseen for the EU market is Formulation 3 rather than Formulation 4. 
Comparability of PK-data and comparability of efficacy and safety resulting from the different sirolimus 
formulations  which  have  been  applied  in  the  PK-studies,  phase  I/II  and  phase  III  study  and  differing 
from  the  commercial  formulation  has  been  sufficiently  justified.  Formulation  3  and  the  preceding 
Formulation 2 are essentially the same. As the vast majority of clinical datasets has been generated with 
both Formulations 2 and 3, it is agreed that nearly all pivotal efficacy and safety data were obtained with 
the gel formulation without overage, as proposed for marketing. 
The safety data from clinical studies in NF1 patients is considered to represent a worst-case scenario, 
i.e. administration of a higher sirolimus dose concentration on a greater skin surface. Furthermore, since 
the underlying disease is different and the pathogenic processes in the skin are not the same in AF and 
NF1, safety data presented could be considered of limited relevance to this MAA. However, formulation 
4 was used in NF1 studies, therefore, the safety data from these studies has also been assessed. 
Treatment duration/gel amount 
In pivotal study (NPC 12G-1) the mean treatment duration was comparable between the groups (87.1 
days in the sirolimus gel, 0.2% group and 86.1 days in the placebo group). 
In  long-term  study,  the  mean  treatment  duration  was  731  days  (about  2  years),  and  the  longest 
treatment duration approximately 2.6 years. 
There were no differences in mean gel amount used between patients receiving sirolimus gel, 0.2% (59.9 
g-corresponding to 0.12 g sirolimus administered overall over a 12-week period) and placebo (61.4g) in 
study NPC-12G-1.  
In NPC-12G-2 study, the mean total gel amount was 346 g for patients overall (corresponding to 0.69 g 
sirolimus administered overall over a 2-year period). 
Adverse events 
Study NPC-12G-1 
In the study NPC-12G-1 the incidence of AEs was 90% in patients treated with sirolimus gel, 0.2%, vs 
69%  in  patients  treated  with  placebo.  The  most  frequent  (>10%)  AEs  by  preferred  term  in  patients 
treated with sirolimus gel, 0.2% were dry skin and application  site irritation (each 37%), followed by 
pruritus  (23%).  Incidences  of  these  events  tended  to  be  higher  with  sirolimus  than  with  placebo, 
although  the  high  incidence  of  application  site  irritation  in  the  placebo  group  of  28%  (vs  37%  with 
sirolimus) was reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 97/108 
 
 
 
 
No severe AEs were reported in study NPC-12G-1; all adverse events were mild (63% for sirolimus 0.2% 
and  placebo  each)  or  moderate  (27%  for  sirolimus  0.2%,  vs  6%  for  placebo).  The  pattern  of  AEs  of 
moderate intensity AEs in the sirolimus group was reflective of the overall AE profile. No AE of moderate 
intensity by preferred term was reported in >1 patient in the sirolimus arm. 
Drug-related AEs were reported in 73.3% of patients receiving sirolimus gel, 0.2%, vs 46.9% of patients 
on placebo. The most frequent (>10%) drug-related AEs in patients receiving sirolimus gel, 0.2% were 
dry skin and application site irritation (36.7% each), followed by pruritus (16.7%).  
Of  note,  28.1%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  had  application  site  irritation  judged  as  being  drug-
related. 
Study NPC-12G-2 
The  most  frequent  (>20%)  AE  by  preferred  term  was  nasopharyngitis  (52%),  followed  by  dry  skin 
(37%), acne (35%), application site irritation (31%), and influenza (22%). The most frequent (>10%) 
drug related AEs were application site irritation (31%), dry skin (28%), and acne (20%). 
Severe AEs were reported in 6% of patients, with preferred terms of pneumonia mycoplasmal, loss of 
consciousness,  brain  oedema,  pneumothorax,  therapeutic  embolisation,  and  corpus  callosotomy 
reported in one patient each.  
Moderate intensity AEs were reported in 49% of patients. The most frequent (>10%) moderate AEs were 
nasopharyngitis (19%), influenza (14%), dry skin (12%), and acne (11%). 
Study OSD-001-001 
In  the  study  OSD-001-001  the  incidence  of  AEs  was  58.3%  in  the  placebo  group,  75%  for  sirolimus 
0.05%, and 87.5% for each sirolimus 0.1% and 0.2%, suggesting a sirolimus concentration effect. In 
patients  receiving  sirolimus  0.2%,  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (87.5%)  were  the  most 
frequent AEs by SOC, with dry skin (50%) and dermatitis acneiform (37.5%) as most frequent preferred 
terms and were all (except for one case of Dermatitis acneiform) considered drug related.  Even though 
the  patient  numbers  overall  and  in  each  group  are  small,  the  data  suggest  a  possible  concentration 
relationship, notably for skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and for the preferred term of dry skin 
in particular. 
Only 2 patients discontinued because of AEs (eye irritation/erythema and contact dermatitis), and that 
being in the long-term study NPC-12G-2. 
No AEs leading to death were reported in any of the AF studies. 
There  were  two  SAE  reported  in  study  NPC-12G-1,  both  in  same  patient  (gastric  haemorrhage  and 
pancreatitis  acute)  in  the  NPC-12G  group.  Pancreatitis  acute  was  considered  drug  related  as  per 
investigator, and pancreatitis is a known, common ADR of oral sirolimus. The investigator stated that 
the primary cause of the acute pancreatitis was oppression of the pancreas caused by marked intestinal 
gas with aerophagia and severe constipation. After gaining control on the underlying causes (defecation 
control) the patient was discharged from hospital. However, relation to the study drug could not be rule 
out (although this relationship seems highly unlikely). Therefore, the final assessment of the applicant 
is that the one case of acute pancreatitis in the patient NPC-01-04 should not be considered causally 
related to the study drug. 
None of SAE reported in the study NPC-12G-2 and Study OSD-001-001 were considered as drug related. 
Based on the nonclinical findings and as a precaution  in  the clinical setting,  patients  in  all  AF  studies 
were  instructed  to  avoid  direct  sunlight  and  to  use  sunscreen.  AE  data  from  the  AF  studies  were 
scrutinised  to  identify  any  possible  event  potentially  indicative  of  photosensitivity.  Overall,  4  patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 98/108 
 
 
 
 
were  identified  in  the  long-term  study  NPC-12G-2  based  on  preferred  terms;  including  2  patients  in 
whom drug relatedness of the event could not be excluded. Therefore, risk of inducing photosensitivity 
with sirolimus gel, 0.2% cannot be ruled out.  
In  addition,  for  systemic  sirolimus,  the  Rapamune  SmPC  section  4.4  includes  a  rather  strict  wording 
related to malignancy and protection from UV light (“Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible 
development  of  lymphoma  and  other  malignancies,  particularly  of  the  skin,  may  result  from 
immunosuppression (see section 4.8). As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure 
to  sunlight  and  ultraviolet  (UV)  light  should  be  limited  by  wearing  protective  clothing  and  using  a 
sunscreen with a high protection factor”). The SmPC for Hyftor contains a recommendation to avoid UV 
light, however, there is no mentioning of the risk of skin malignancies. The Applicant agreed to include 
a warning in Section 4.4 of the revised SmPC as precautionary measure, which is considered adequate. 
Adverse drug reactions for the SmPC 
The  ADRs  of  the  reference  medicinal  product  Rapamune  were  not  directly  taken  into  account  since 
Rapamune is used systemically and according to the applicant, not representative for safety profile of 
topical sirolimus administration. Nevertheless, PK data collected in the AF studies shows certain (in most 
cases low) systemic exposure after topical sirolimus gel, therefore, systemic effects cannot be ruled out. 
The  Applicant  has  provided  a  detailed  presentation  of  the  patient  flow  between  studies  including  the 
respective  treatment  received  and  included  the  0.2%  population  as  of  study  OSD-001-001  in  an 
additional safety analysis. Overall, 4 out of 98 patients who received 0.2% sirolimus gel were treated 
only in study OSD-001-001 and were not enrolled thereafter in either study NPC-12G-1 or NPC-12G-2. 
The  most  comprehensive  safety  data  now  includes  all  98  patients  who  received  0,2%  sirolimus  gel 
formulation throughout the three studies.  
AEs of hypercholesterolaemia, increased LDL, and hypertriglyceridaemia were initially added to the ADR 
table of the initially proposed SmPC, in addition to adverse drug reactions identified from studies NPC-
12G-1 and NPC-12G-2. However, after further internal evaluations and discussions with experts in the 
field, the low expected systemic exposure, if any, and the fact that none of the AEs was judged as being 
drug-related by either the investigators or the sponsor, the Applicant and the CHMP concluded that these 
AEs should not be included in the ADR table of the SmPC section 4.8. 
The ADR table in the section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated, accordingly.  
Drug interaction 
Drug-drug  interaction  profile  of  the  sirolimus  is  already  known  from  the  approved  oral  sirolimus 
formulations,  therefore  applicant  conducted  no  dedicated  DDI  studies.  Since  systemic  exposure  after 
topical treatment is lower than with oral sirolimus therapy, the risk of any systemic interaction emerging 
is  also  considered  lower.  The  section  4.5  of  the  proposed  SmPC  already  included  some  general 
information,  based  on  oral  sirolimus  interaction  potential  which  is  acknowledged.  However,  as  seven 
patients in long term study had sirolimus blood concentration > 1 ng/ml (with a maximum value of 3.27 
ng/ml) at individual assessments time points, it is seen that the absorption of the topical sirolimus could 
be considerable to that measure where drug interactions could be possible and clinically relevant.  This 
applies  in  particulary  to  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  (e.g.  ketoconazole,  voriconazole,  itraconazole, 
telithromycin,  or  clarithromycin),  which  decrease  the  metabolism  of  sirolimus  and  increase  sirolimus 
levels and consequently may lead to worse safety profile from the one seen in AF clinical studies.  
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No  studies  were  performed  that  were  specifically  designed  to  evaluate  adverse  withdrawal  and/or 
rebound  effects.  However,  the  results  from  the  studies  OSD-001-001  and  NPC-12G-1  indicate  that 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 99/108 
 
 
 
 
stopping topical sirolimus treatment leads to relapse of AF lesions. The same has also been suggested 
in the literature.  Therefore, continued exposure would be required to suppress/control the disease. The 
Applicant does not propose any recommendations for dose interruptions or dose modifications, although 
according to the data presented from the long-term safety study NPC-12G-2, in this study, dosing was 
stopped,  interrupted,  or  modified  based  investigator’s  assessment  due  to  the  occurrence  of  adverse 
events. It is agreed however that due to a limited number of patients the available data do not allow 
concrete  recommendations  for  dose  interruptions  or  dose  modifications  to  be  given  in  the  product 
information at this time. 
Paediatric population 
Impaired skin barrier function in very young children exposing them to an even higher risk of systemic 
absorption of sirolimus should be considered. Since no patients less than 6 years actually enrolled in the 
pivotal phase III study nor in the phase I/II study, there are currently, very limited data justifying an 
indication below the age of 6 years. Of note, only 4 paediatric patients age ≥3 <6 were enrolled in the 
long-term  safety  study.  Furthermore,  paediatric  study  population  ≥  6  years  has  not  been  sufficiently 
characterised  yet.  The  proposed  indication  now  includes  an  age  limit  for  paediatric  population  (i.e.  6 
years and older). 
Post marketing experience 
Additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  following  approval  of  Rapalimus  Gel  in  Japan  included:  post-
marketing clinical study, early post-marketing phase vigilance and drug use-results survey. Overall, 639 
patients  were  included  in  the  safety  analysis  set  and  634  patients  were  included  in  the  effectiveness 
analysis set. 
The  incidence  of  adverse  reactions  was  18%,  which  is  lower  when  compared  to  incidence  of  adverse 
reactions  observed  in  AF  clinical  studies;  acne  (4%),  application  site  irritation  (3%),  dry  skin  (2%), 
application site erythema (2%) being most common.  
The applicant is not planning to update section 4.8 of the SmPC with any new safety information from 
the post-marketing surveillance Rapalimus Gel 0.2% general drug use survey. 
2.4.10.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, topical 0.2% sirolimus gel was generally well tolerated; the symptom most frequently reported 
by patients were mild-to moderate and dermatologic in nature, occurring at or near the site of application 
(i.e. irritation limited to the site of application).  
Systemic exposure after topical treatment is considerably lower compared to oral sirolimus therapy. 
Consequently, the risk of any systemic adverse reaction of sirolimus gel is expected to be lower, 
compared to the reference product (Rapamune oral). However, both the risk of systemic interactions 
or the risk of systemic adverse reactions cannot be completely excluded based on the available PK and 
safety data. 
Considering the number of patients included in clinical studies for sirolimus gel 0.2% was limited, the 
information on the safety of sirolimus gel should continue to be collected via routine post-marketing 
surveillance.

2.6.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.6.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.6.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the new pharmaceutical form, route of administration and indication, the PRAC is of the 
opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for Hyftor is needed, as it cannot follow the already 
existing entry for sirolimus. The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this 
medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not 
request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list 
entry will therefore use the EBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
Therapeutic Context 
Disease or condition 
Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a rare genetic disease caused by defects in the TSC1 or TSC1 gene leading 
to  the  development  of  non-cancerous  (benign)  tumors  in  the  brain  and  several  areas  of  the  body, 
including  the  spinal  cord,  nerves,  eyes,  lung,  heart,  kidneys,  and  skin.  TSC  is  a  lifelong  condition. 
Currently there is no cure for TSC, but some symptoms can be treated. The prognosis for individuals 
with TSC is highly variable and depends on the severity of symptoms. 
Nearly all individuals with TSC develop skin abnormalities, including angiofibromas (AFs), hypomelanotic 
macules, shagreen patches, fibrous plaques, and ungual fibromas. In the Tuberous Sclerosis Registry to 
Increase Disease Awareness (TOSCA) study, facial angiofibromas were observed in 57.3% of the patients 
and manifested since the early years of life in patients from the TOSCA study. 
AF presents as small papules or red spots primarily on the face, often in a butterfly pattern, and may 
first appear in patients aged 3 to 5 years. Some can start early in life (in the first years) and then affect 
the skin during puberty and later stages. Untreated, these papules become more numerous and larger 
over time and through adolescence. In adulthood, the lesions tend to be stable or to grow more slowly.

Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Management of AF associated with TSC is today based on the recommendations of the 2012 International 
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference which is globally accepted. With regard to dermal 
manifestations  of  TSC,  the  guidelines  recommend  that  rapidly  changing,  bleeding,  disfiguring,  or 
symptomatic  TSC-associated  skin  lesions  should  be  treated  as  appropriate  for  the  lesion  and  clinical 
context, using physical approaches such as surgical excision, laser, or possibly topical mTOR inhibitors. 
As topical mTORs are not yet marketed (exception is Japan where sirolimus 0.2% gel is marketed since 
2018), the modalities of its use are heterogeneous, with widespread uncontrolled use. 
Hyftor, the product applied for, is a sirolimus gel for topical use. The final wording of the indication is: 
“Hyftor is indicated for treatment of facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in 
adults and paediatric patients aged 6 years and older.” 
Main clinical studies 
Main efficacy data come from a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study NPC-12G-
1 (n=30 patients receiving sirolimus gel, 0.2% for 12 weeks) and an uncontrolled, open-label long-time 
(safety) study (NPC-12G-2)(n=94 patients receiving sirolimus gel, 0.2%, with efficacy data through 52 
weeks), with supportive evidence from a dose escalation (OSD-001-001) study of sirolimus 0.05, 0.1, 
and 0.2% in 36 patients, all of them performed in Japanese AF patients.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite endpoint measuring changes from baseline to week 12 
in AF size and extension (shrinkage, flattening, disappearance) and changes in AF redness.  The scoring 
system  included  the  degrees  markedly  improved,  improved,  slightly  improved,  unchanged,  slightly 
exacerbated and exacerbated based on prespecified criteria. The primary assessment was performed by 
the IRC (Independent Review Committee) using photographs. 
Favourable effects 
In  the  pivotal  study  NPC-12G-1,  sirolimus  gel,  0.2%  achieved  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically 
relevant improvement in AF over placebo, including composite AF improvement, improvement in AF size, 
and  improvement  in  AF  redness.  The  response  rate  with  sirolimus  gel,  0.2%  at  12  weeks  (based  on 
composite AF improvement and IRC assessment) was 60.0% (18/30) vs. 0% in placebo group. 
Change in AF size at Week 12 compared to baseline was markedly improved or improved in 60% (18/30) 
of patients receiving sirolimus gel 0.2% vs 3% (1/32) of patients receiving placebo.  
Change in AF redness at Week 12 compared to baseline (by IRC) was markedly improved or improved 
in 40% (12/30) of patients receiving sirolimus gel 0.2% vs 0% of patients receiving placebo. 
The  redness  and  size  of  angiofibromas  are  considered  clinically  relevant  characteristics  of  facial 
angiofibroma. 
In study NPC-12G-2, the response rate at Week 12 was at 59%, confirming the response rate seen in 
the pivotal study. Composite AF improvement in the long-term safety study continued beyond 12 weeks 
and over the entire assessment period, reaching 78% at 52 weeks. Paediatric patients improved faster 
than adult patients but to a similar extent at week 52. 
Systemic exposure after topical treatment is considerably lower compared to oral sirolimus therapy.

Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The scale/scoring system used in the primary analysis is not formally validated, however, appears 
reasonable and acceptable. The applicant does not plan to make any claims regarding concomitant use 
of oral mTOR inhibitors in the labelling and it is agreed that currently no treatment recommendation 
for such patient population can be issued. Nevertheless, the Applicant should further continue to collect 
information on the safety and effectiveness of concomitant use of mTOR inhibitors via routine 
pharmacovigilance. 
Unfavourable effects 
Topical  0.2%  sirolimus  gel  was  generally  well  tolerated;  the  symptom  most  frequently  reported  by 
patients were mild-to moderate and dermatologic in nature, occurring at or near the site of application 
(i.e. irritation limited to the site of application).  
PK  data  retrieved  from  3  studies  show  that  about  3  quarters  of  patients  had  measurable  blood 
concentrations upon treatment with sirolimus gel, 0.2%, with  mean and median blood concentrations 
being <1 ng/mL. This is considerably lower than the targeted concentrations of oral Rapamune treatment 
for immunosuppression or for the treatment of sLAM.  
Systemic AEs considered related to the treatment (including, among other things, stomatitis) have been 
reported.  
Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The  safety  database  is  considered  limited;  however,  since  the  underlying  disease  TSC  is  an  orphan 
disease this is considered acceptable.  
In some of the patients with systemic adverse effects, concomitant use of oral mTOR inhibitors may have 
been the culprit. Nevertheless, the risk of systemic adverse reactions with the sirolimus gel cannot be 
completely excluded based on the available PK and safety data. Therefore, certain systemic ADRs and 
the  risk  of  the  specific  ADRs  of  the  reference  product  Rapamune  have  been  included  in  the  SmPC  of 
Hyftor.

3.2.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.2.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important effect observed in the pivotal study NPC-12G-1 is improvement in AFs which 
includes composite AF improvement, improvement in AF size, and improvement in AF redness. The 
response rate with sirolimus gel, 0.2% at 12 weeks (based on composite AF improvement and IRC 
assessment) was 60.0% (18/30) vs. 0% in placebo group. Change in AF size at Week 12 compared to 
baseline was markedly improved or improved in 60% (18/30) of patients receiving sirolimus gel 0.2% 
vs 3% (1/32) of patients receiving placebo. Change in AF redness at Week 12 compared to baseline 
(by IRC) was markedly improved or improved in 40% (12/30) of patients receiving sirolimus gel 0.2% 
vs 0% of patients receiving placebo. The redness and size of angiofibromas are considered clinically 
relevant characteristics of facial angiofibroma and statistically significant treatment benefit of sirolimus 
gel, 0.2% over placebo based on 3 endpoints, i.e. composite AF improvement and its components has 
been demonstrated. 
The treatment benefit of sirolimus gel, 0.2% was generally shown to be consistent across subgroups. 
In study NPC-12G-2, the response rate at Week 12 was at 59%, confirming the response rate seen in 
the pivotal study. Composite AF improvement in the long-term safety study continued beyond 12 
weeks and over the entire assessment period, reaching 78% at 52 weeks. Paediatric patients improved 
faster than adult patients but to a similar extent at week 52. 
Systemic exposure after topical treatment is considerably lower compared to oral sirolimus therapy. 
Nevertheless, both the risk of systemic interactions and the risk of systemic adverse reactions cannot 
be completely excluded based on the available PK and safety data. 
Almost all patients treated with sirolimus gel reported at least one AE, which were generally mild and 
moderate in intensity. About 70% of patients across the AF studies experienced drug-related skin 
irritation symptoms. In about a third of the patients dry skin and application site irritation were 
reported as ADRs. Pruritus (17%) was also frequent in pivotal phase III study, while in the long-term 
safety study, acne (20%) was frequent but not pruritus. 
3.2.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The response rate of 60% observed with sirolimus gel, 0.2% at 12 weeks (based on composite AF 
improvement and IRC assessment) is considered clinically relevant from the clinical point of view and 
is considered to outweigh the increased incidence of mild-to moderate AE, dermatologic in nature, 
occurring mostly at or near the site of application.  
Short and long-term efficacy of the sirolimus gel applied for (Hyftor) in the treatment of facial 
angiofibroma have been sufficiently shown and the safety profile is acceptable. 
Taking into account the favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk balance is considered 
positive. 
3.2.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The applicant makes reference to data generated with the reference product Rapamune with regard to 
pharmacology and safety of systemically absorbed sirolimus. Considering the substantial own 
development programme to support efficacy and safety in the new indication applied for and the much 
lower systemic exposure to sirolimus from topically applied Hyftor compared to oral Rapamune, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/119439/2023  
Page 107/108 
 
 
 
 
comparative bioavailability study NPC-12G-4/US is not considered pivotal to establish a scientific 
bridge to the reference product. In this specific case, containing the same active substance is sufficient 
to establish a “scientific bridge” between Hyftor and the reference product.    
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Hyftor is not similar to Votubia and Epidyolex within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Hyftor is favourable in the following indication: 
Hyftor is indicated for the treatment of facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex 
in adults and paediatric patients aged 6 years and older. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States. 
Not applicable.

This study also assessed whether the addition of OBV/PTV/r 
could achieve comparable sustained virologic response 
(SVR) rates with shorter treatment durations of 6 and 8 
weeks in subjects with GT2 HCV infection without cirrhosis.  
The results of this study support the safety and antiviral 
activity of 12 weeks of coformulated OBV/PTV/r 
coadministered with SOF with or without RBV in TN and TE 
adults with HCV GT3 infection with compensated cirrhosis 
or without cirrhosis. In addition, a high SVR 12 weeks post 
dosing (SVR12) rate was observed in subjects with GT2 
infection who received OBV/PTV/r + SOF + RBV for 8 
weeks. In contrast, shortening the treatment duration to 6 
weeks resulted in a low SVR12 rate in subjects with HCV 
GT2 infection. A favorable safety profile was observed for 
all treatment regimens studied.

Sustained virologic response at week 12 (SVR12) was 
achieved in 21/22 (95.5%) of the subjects included in Part 
1 and in 6/7 (85.7%) of the subjects included in Part 2. No 
subject who achieved SVR12 relapsed through the 48 
weeks follow-up, which suggests that efficacy is 
comparable with previous clinical results associated with 
this treatment regimen 
No baseline or treatment-emergent substitutions were 
identified in NS5A or NS5B at signature amino acid 
positions except for the subject in Part 2 who experienced 
on-treatment virologic failure where treatment-emergent 
substitutions were observed in NS3 and NS5B at the time 
of failure. Except from that case, baseline polymorphism in 
NS3, NS5A or NS5B was not associated with impaired 
treatment results. 
Adverse events reported in this study were generally 
consistent with the established safety profile for 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir, and for 
ribavirin (RBV) and the combination of these DAAs with 
RBV in previous studies of HCV subjects with and without 
cirrhosis. No subject experienced a treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAE) that met the criteria for severe 
cutaneous reactions or hepatic decompensation. One 
subject included in Part 1 discontinued the study drugs due 
to pneumonia and one subject in Part 2 experienced 
impaired glucose tolerance. No clinically relevant results of 
urinalysis, vital signs, or ECGs were observed. No deaths 
were reported.

Viekirax, is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. Given that 
disopyramide is partly eliminated by metabolism via 
CYP3A4x, co-administration with ritonavir might result in 
increased disopyramide exposures. As disopyramide has a 
narrow therapeutic index, a risk for a clinically relevant 
interaction between disopyramide and CYP3A4 inhibitors 
cannot be excluded. Furthermore, literature articles report 
potentially life-threatening outcome of concomitant 
treatment of CYP3A4 inhibitors with disopyramide. 
Therefore, disopyramide has been contraindicated with 
Viekirax.

phase 3, long-term follow-up study to assess

response and a low frequency of events related to liver 
disease and/or HCV infection over an observation period of 
up to 3 years in subjects who achieved SVR12 in a previous 
applicant DAA study. Treatment emergent resistance-
associated substitutions in NS3 declined over time, while 
most substitutions in NS5A persisted through PT Week 96. 
Due to the limited data, no conclusions can be made on the 
persistence of treatment-emergent substitutions in NS5B. 
Based on these results the CHMP did not warrant an update 
of the product information.

Submission of the final reports for two phase IIIb

are open-label studies evaluating the safety and

dasabuvir with or without ribavirin in hepatitis C 
virus infected patients with several renal impairment

subjects with genotype 1 infection with or without cirrhosis 
who have severe renal impairment or end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) in RUBY-I study. The overall safety profile 
in subjects with severe renal impairment was similar to that 
seen in prior Phase III studies in subjects without severe 
renal impairment, except that a greater proportion of 
subjects required intervention due to ribavirin-associated 
decreases in serum haemoglobin. The mean baseline 
haemoglobin level was 12.1 g/dL and the mean decline in 
haemoglobin at the end of treatment for subjects taking 
ribavirin was 1.2 g/dL. Thirty-nine of the 50 subjects who

recommended doses and monitoring strategies can be 
found in section 4.5. Everolimus cannot be used due to lack

metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP3A). This means 
that inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A have the potential to 
interact on these active substances. The exposure of these 
active substances could be increased which may lead to 
potential toxicities, including a dose-related QTc 
prolongation. Their co-administration with potent 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir) is 
also contraindicated. 
Therefore, given the potential safety concerns related to 
potential changes in exposures of ranolazine, dronedarone 
and lurasidone when co-administrated with the 2-DAA 
(Direct Acting Antivirals) or 3-DAA regimens, the CHMP 
considers that the product information of the medicinal 
product containing the association of ombitasvir / 
paritaprevir / ritonavir (Viekirax) should be updated to 
reflect that the co-administration with ranolazine, 
dronedarone and lurasidone is contraindicated.

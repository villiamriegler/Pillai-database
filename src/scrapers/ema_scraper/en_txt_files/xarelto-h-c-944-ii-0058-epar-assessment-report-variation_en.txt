2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that acts by inhibiting thrombin formation and thus 
formation of thrombi. In the EU, rivaroxaban is approved for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism 
in atrial fibrillation, treatment and prevention of venous thrombosis and, in addition to acetylsalicylic acid 
(ASA) or ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine, for prevention of atherothrombotic events after an ACS. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder proposed an extension of indication with this application to include 
the prevention of stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death, and the prevention of acute limb

ischaemia and mortality in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease 
(PAD) for rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid co-administered with ASA. 
Stable CAD is usually characterized by episodes of reversible myocardial ischaemia or hypoxia, induced 
by exercise, emotion or occurring spontaneously, with symptoms of angina pectoris. The 
pathophysiological mechanisms that cause stable CAD are traditionally described as atherosclerotic 
narrowings of ≥50% of the left main coronary artery and ≥70% in one or several of the major coronary 
arteries; however, in more recent years, other pathophysiological features such as microvascular 
dysfunction and coronary vasospasm have also been distinguished. CAD can also present clinically as left 
ventricular dysfunction caused by ischaemic cardiomyopathy. The clinical presentation and severity of 
CAD varies considerably between individuals. Other medical conditions that are not caused by CAD could 
present clinically with symptoms of angina pectoris, including valvular disease (e.g. aortic stenosis), 
tachyarrhythmia and severe anaemia. 
Stable CAD with symptoms of angina pectoris is essentially a diagnosis based on history and the 
characteristics of chest pain. In most patients, however, apart from physical examination, some objective 
tests are performed to confirm the diagnosis, assess underlying disease and assist in risk stratification. 
Such testing includes biochemistry, resting ECG, echocardiography and stress testing. However, for 
patients in which revascularization is unlikely to be an option, investigations may be reduced to a clinically 
indicated minimum and appropriate therapy should be commenced although objective testing has not 
been performed (ESC Guidelines 2013). 
The natural history of the disease varies greatly between individuals. In patients with stable angina 
pectoris only, the prognosis is usually favourable with a low risk of mortality (approx. 1% annually) and 
a low risk of MI (approx. 1-3% annually). However, the prognosis is poorer in patients with heart failure, 
a greater number of diseased vessels, more proximal locations of coronary stenosis, greater severity of 
lesions, more extensive ischaemia, more impaired functional capacity, older age, significant depression 
and more severe angina (ESC Guidelines 2013). Thus, risk stratification based on clinical evaluation, 
ventricular function, stress testing and coronary anatomy is important when deciding on the optimal 
therapy for a patient. Within a population with stable CAD, an individual’s prognosis can vary 
considerably, depending on baseline clinical, functional and anatomical characteristics. This is exemplified 
in the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) registry which included very 
high-risk patients, many with peripheral arterial disease or previous MI and almost 50% with diabetes. 
Consequently, annual mortality rate was as high as 3.8% in this population, whereas patients with 
non-obstructive plaques within the coronary arteries have an annual mortality rate of only 0.63% (ESC 
Guidelines for CAD 2013).  
Existing pharmacological treatments of CAD aim at relief from symptoms and to prevent CV events by 
reducing plaque progression, stabilize plaques, reduce inflammation and prevent thrombosis. For event 
prevention in stable CAD patients, lipid-lowering agents, anti-hypertensive agents and antithrombotic 
agents are used. For most patients, SAPT (single antiplatelet therapy) is recommended as antithrombotic 
treatment; DAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy) is used primarily after an ACS in the acute phase or in stable 
CAD after a PCI procedure. It has been convincingly demonstrated that increasing the intensity of 
antithrombotic therapy for secondary prevention of CV events is effective, but at the cost of an increase 
in bleeding. In stable CAD patients, combined antiplatelet therapy by addition of vorapaxar (a 
PAR-1-antagonist) in addition to standard antiplatelet therapy has been proven to significantly reduce a 
composite of CV death, MI or stroke, particularly in post-MI patients, but at the cost of an increased risk 
of moderate and severe bleeding. In the ESC Guidelines, it was concluded that combined antiplatelet 
therapy may be beneficial only in selected patients at high risk of ischaemic events, not to be 
recommended systematically in SCAD patients.

PAD (peripheral arterial disease) encompasses all arterial diseases other than coronary arteries and the 
aorta, and should be distinguished from peripheral artery disease, which is often used for lower extremity 
artery disease (LEAD). In the COMPASS trial, PAD was represented by patients with LEAD and carotid 
stenosis only. PAD secondary to atherosclerosis and CAD often share the same risk factors, including 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, obesity, smoking, sedentary lifestyle and family history. 
Patients affected by PAD are also at risk for other atherosclerotic events. 10-year rates of coronary 
events, CV mortality and total mortality has been showed to be doubled in LEAD patients (Fowkes et al, 
2008). ABI is considered to be a strong marker for CV events (ESC Guidelines on the Diagnosis and 
Treatment of Peripheral Arterial Diseases, 2017). As with CAD, pharmacological treatments of PAD aim at 
reducing symptoms, and prevent CV events by using lipid-lowering, antihypertensive and antithrombotic 
drugs. In the ESC Guidelines from 2017, the antithrombotic regimens are similar to CAD. SAPT forms the 
basis, with low-dose aspirin for carotid artery stenosis, and clopidogrel in symptomatic LEAD or LEAD that 
has undergone revascularization. Anticoagulation therapy is recommended only in patients with a 
concomitant indication that requires anticoagulation, and could be combined with SAPT after a recent 
revascularization procedure.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated ERA with a study on Algal (Desmodesmus subspicatus) growth inhibition (OECD 201) was 
submitted. The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) and the lowest observed effect concentration 
(LOEC) was 0.52 and 1.02 mg/L respectively. 
The PECsurfacewater was revised by adding the PEC for the existing indications with the PEC of the new 
indication. The revised PECsurfacewater has been re-calculated to 0.12 μg/L. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the available data, no risks were identified for rivaroxaban with regard to the various 
environmental compartments and no specific labelling regarding the environmental risk is required. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Treatments 
During the run-in period, Day -28 to Day -1, eligible subjects (excluding those who were randomized 
between Day 4-7 after CABG surgery) who had signed informed consent and stopped non-study 
anticoagulants and aspirin received rivaroxaban placebo bid and aspirin 100 mg od.  
Subjects who had completed the run-in period with at least 80% adherence to treatment were first 
divided in those who had a continuous need for PPI and those who did not. The latter group was 
randomized to pantoprazole 40 mg od or matching placebo. Thereafter, the participants were randomized 
into three arms of different antithrombotic treatments: 
Arm A: rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od 
Arm B: rivaroxaban 5 mg bid/aspirin placebo od 
Arm C: rivaroxaban placebo bid/aspirin 100 mg od 
Objectives 
Primary objectives for rivaroxaban randomization were 
• 
• 
To determine whether rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od compared with aspirin 100 mg 
od reduces the risk of a composite of MI, stroke, or CV death in subjects with CAD or PAD 
To determine whether rivaroxaban 5 mg bid compared with aspirin 100 mg od reduces the risk of 
a composite of MI, stroke, or CV death in subjects with CAD or PAD 
Secondary objectives for rivaroxaban randomization were 
• 
• 
• 
To determine whether each of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od and rivaroxaban 5 mg 
bid alone reduces the risk of the composite of major thrombotic events: CHD death, MI, ischemic 
stroke, acute limb ischemia (ALI), compared with aspirin 100 mg od in subjects with CAD or PAD 
To determine whether each of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od and rivaroxaban 5 mg 
bid alone reduces the risk of the composite of major thrombotic events: CV death, MI, ischemic 
stroke, ALI, compared with aspirin 100 mg od in subjects with CAD or PAD 
To determine whether each of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od and rivaroxaban 5 mg bid 
alone reduces the risk of mortality compared with aspirin 100 mg od in subjects with CAD or PAD 
Objective for pantoprazole randomization was 
• 
To determine whether pantoprazole 40 mg od compared with placebo reduces the risk of upper GI 
bleeding, ulceration, or GI obstruction or perforation in subjects with CAD or PAD receiving 
antithrombotic study medications 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy outcome was the time (in days) from randomization to the first occurrence of the 
composite of the following efficacy outcome events: 
•  Myocardial infarction or 
•  Stroke or 
•  Cardiovascular death 
Assessment report  
Xarelto 
Page 12/70 
 
 
 
Secondary efficacy outcomes were the time (in days) from randomization to the first occurrence of the 
following secondary efficacy outcomes – in the order as specified below: 
1.  The composite of outcomes – CHD death, MI, ischemic stroke or ALI 
2.  The composite of outcomes – CV death, MI, ischemic stroke or ALI 
3.  All-cause mortality 
CHD death includes death due to acute MI, sudden cardiac death, or death due to a CV procedure and is 
only derived via adjudication. ALI is defined as limb-threatening ischemia that is confirmed by limb 
hemodynamics or imaging and leads to an acute vascular intervention (i.e. pharmacologic [heparin, 
thrombolysis], peripheral arterial surgery/reconstruction, peripheral angioplasty/stent, or amputation) 
within 30 days of onset of symptoms. In the absence of confirmation by limb hemodynamics or imaging, 
absent pedal pulses is acceptable as hemodynamic criterion for ALI. 
Tertiary efficacy outcomes included: 
• 
The time (in days) from randomization to the first occurrence of the following tertiary efficacy 
outcomes: 
o 
Individual components of the primary and secondary outcomes, i.e., MI, stroke, ischemic 
stroke, CV death, CHD death, ALI, and non-CV death 
Primary safety variable was the time (in days) from randomization to the first occurrence of the following 
primary safety outcome: 
Modified International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding, defined as: 
I. 
fatal bleeding, or 
II. 
symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, 
retroperitoneal, intraarticular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, 
or bleeding into the surgical site requiring reoperation, or 
III. 
bleeding leading to hospitalization* 
*Major bleeding also includes presentation to an acute care facility with discharge on the same day. 
A net clinical benefit time-to-event variable was defined as the composite of the primary efficacy outcome 
and the primary safety outcome, excluding bleedings leading to hospitalization and bleedings into surgical 
site associated with re-operation (thus representing fatal or symptomatic critical organ bleeding only). 
The outcome for the pantoprazole randomization is the composite of the following outcomes: 
•  Overt bleeding of gastroduodenal origin confirmed by endoscopy or radiography 
•  Overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin 
•  Bleeding of presumed occult gastrointestinal origin with documented decrease in Hb of 2 g/dL 
from baseline 
•  Symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcer 
•  Gastrointestinal pain with underlying multiple gastroduodenal erosions, obstruction or 
perforation

Sample size 
Initially, approximately 19,500 eligible subjects were to be admitted to the run-in period and an additional 
2000 were to be enrolled post CABG and without run-in. Approximately 10% of run-in subjects were 
expected to either be non-compliant with treatment or to decline further interest in participating; thus, 
the study was to randomise approximately 19,500 subjects, at least 6,500 subjects per antithrombotic 
study group. 
The study was event-driven and was to continue until a minimum of 2,200 subjects had experienced an 
event for the primary efficacy outcome. The aim was to have at least 90% power to detect a 20% relative 
risk reduction for each of the two rivaroxaban treatment groups versus the aspirin control group. 
The following assumptions were made for the antithrombotic treatment part of the study; a 2-sided type 
I error level of 2.7% for each of the two comparisons to control the overall type I error level of 5%, an 
annual event rate in the aspirin control group between 4.0% and 4.5%, a recruitment period of about 2.5 
years, a total expected study duration of 4.5 to 5 years and, an early study drug discontinuation rate of 
about 6% and 4% in the 1st and 2nd 6-month periods, and 3% in the 6-month periods thereafter. 
Within study protocol amendment 6 (03 July 2014) the number of subjects was increased to 21,400 
randomised ((approximately 7,134 subjects per treatment group)) based on emerging data which 
suggested that a realistic event rate was 3.5-4.0% rather than 4.0-4.5%.  
During the first 2 years after randomisation of the first patient, it was found that the actual randomisation 
was slower than expected and that the observed cumulated overall annual incidence was at the lower end 
of the projected range of 3.0 to 4.0%. This led to the decision to continue enrollment to maintain the 
study duration in the originally planned range of 4.5 to 5 years. Simulations were performed to justify the 
implied sample size increase, based on the following revised assumptions, which are partially taken from 
the blinded data observed within the first 2 years of the trial;  
•  Overall length of recruitment period about 3 to 3.5 years, where randomisation times are 
taken as observed for the first ~18,000 subjects 
o 
o  assumed to be approximately uniform over about 10 months with some seasonal 
variation for the remaining ~9,400 subjects 
•  2-sided overall type I error level of 5% using a truncated Hochberg test (γ = 0.9) for the testing 
of the two primary hypotheses 
•  Constant overall incidence rate of about 2.9% per year (95% CI: 2.56 – 3.22%), resulting in a 
constant incidence rate of about 3.3% (95% CI: 2.95 – 3.71%) per year for the aspirin control 
group assuming a 20% relative risk reduction for both hypotheses 
• 
Early discontinuation of study drug: about 6% and 4.5% in the 1st and 2nd 6-month periods, and 
3% in the 6-month periods thereafter 
•  Censoring due to non-CV death at an event rate of almost 1% per year 
Based on these simulation results, the sample size was increased from 21,400 randomised subjects to 
27,400 (approximately 9,134 subjects per treatment group) by protocol amendment 8 (19 Aug 2015).

Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. All doses were provided in tablet form for oral administration. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
Analysis of the primary efficacy outcome was based on the intention-to-treat principle. The 
intention-to-treat analysis set included all randomised subjects. The safety analysis set included all 
randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. 
Methods 
The primary efficacy variable was the time (in days) from randomisation to the first occurrence of the 
composite of the following events: MI, stroke or CV death. Primary statistical analyses were based on 
events which were unrefuted during the adjudication process (that evaluated whether events reported by 
investigators met the pre-specified trial definition). 
Each of the rivaroxaban-based treatment groups were compared to the control group using two separate 
stratified log-rank tests taking into account proton pump inhibitor use (three strata levels: not 
randomised to a proton pump inhibitor; pantoprazole 40 mg od; pantoprazole placebo). Study center was 
not used as a stratification factor in the analysis. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative risk functions and Nelson-Aalen estimates of the cumulative hazard 
functions were provided to evaluate the timing of event occurrence in the three treatment arms and the 
consistency of the respective treatment effects for all time points. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated based on two separate stratified Cox proportional 
hazards models. 
Analyses of the secondary efficacy outcomes and the primary safety time-to-event variable essentially 
used the same statistical methods as described for the primary efficacy variable. 
Assessment report  
Xarelto 
Page 15/70 
 
 
 
 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to include all primary efficacy outcome events up until the minimum 
(earliest) of the final rivaroxaban/aspirin follow-up visit date and the subject’s last contact date during the 
rivaroxaban/aspirin portion of the study. 
In addition, the number of primary efficacy outcome events occurring after the final rivaroxaban/aspirin 
follow-up visit until the rivaroxaban/aspirin washout telephone visit, included in the clean database for 
the rivaroxaban/aspirin comparisons, was summarized by rivaroxaban/aspirin study treatment group. 
The plausibility of the proportional hazards assumption was assessed by visually examining both the plot 
of the log of the negative log of Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival function versus the log of time for 
evidence of non-parallelism and the smoothed plot of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals to directly visualize 
the log hazard ratio, and by including a time*treatment interaction term in the Cox model (time log 
transformed). The significance of the interaction was tested at the 5% type I error level. If the interaction 
was significant and there was strong evidence of non-proportionality from the plots, time-dependent 
hazard ratios were to be estimated with the model that includes the interaction term. 
Multiplicity 
Each of the rivaroxaban-based treatment group was first to be compared with the aspirin control group on 
the primary efficacy outcome, followed by the same comparisons on the three ordered secondary efficacy 
outcomes (Figure 2). The null hypotheses of no effect corresponding to different efficacy outcomes were 
grouped into 4 separate families. Standard logical restrictions were imposed, i.e., the null hypotheses 
were split into two branches corresponding to the tests for rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od 
(hypotheses H1A, H2A, H3A, H4A) and to the tests for rivaroxaban 5 mg bid (hypotheses H1B, H2B, H3B, 
H4B). A null hypothesis within each branch could be tested if and only if the immediately preceding null 
hypothesis was rejected. 
Figure 2. Hypothesis testing problem 
Multiple hypotheses testing was to be performed according to a mixture gatekeeping procedure based on 
the Hochberg test with a truncation fraction of γ = 0.9, which controls the familywise error rate at the 
pre-assigned level of significance α = 5% in the strong sense. The Hochberg-based gatekeeping 
procedure (based on an extension of the general mixture methodology developed in Dmitrienko and 
Tamhane (2011, 2013) and recently proposed in Brechenmacher et al., 2011) was to account for two 
sources of multiplicity at the final analysis; two arms of rivaroxaban/aspirin study treatment being 
compared to the active control aspirin and comparisons being performed for a primary and three

secondary outcomes. A truncation fraction γ close to 1 was chosen to ensure a high probability of success 
for the primary hypotheses, considering that potentially only a small fraction of α is carried forward to the 
next family of hypotheses. The gatekeeping procedure was to use the truncated Hochberg test in Family 
1 to 3 because they were to serve as gatekeepers for the next family in the sequence. The regular 
Hochberg test was to be applied in Family 4 since this was the last family in the testing sequence. 
A third source of multiplicity related to the planned interim analyses and was addressed for the testing of 
the primary outcome via the modified Haybittle-Peto rule. Given conservative monitoring boundaries, the 
type I error level adjustment for the final analysis was considered negligible and no adjustment was 
performed for the final primary efficacy analysis. 
Interim analyses 
Two formal interim analyses were planned when 50% (about 1,100) and 75% (about 1,650) of the 
expected number of accumulated primary efficacy outcome events (2200 subjects with an unrefuted 
event) accrued. 
If the interim analyses showed clear and consistent benefit in both rivaroxaban treatment groups, the 
DSMB could recommend early study termination. The modified Haybittle-Peto rule was to be used to 
guide the decision regarding early stopping of some or all of the study treatment groups: a reduction of 
4 standard deviations in the analysis of the primary efficacy outcome at the first interim analysis 
(one-sided p-value < 0.0001) or 3 standard deviations at the second interim analysis (one-sided p-value 
<0.0014). If the monitoring boundary was crossed at either of the planned interim analyses, a second 
analysis was to be done after at least an additional 3-6 months to confirm the boundary remained crossed 
and that the trend in treatment effect was not temporary. 
For a lack of efficacy, a futility approach was to be utilized. Based on the conditional probability of 
rejecting the null hypothesis for either primary comparison, the DSMB might have considered 
recommending early termination of the study. If the results were clear with one intervention, but not for 
the second intervention, the DSMB could have decided to continue evaluation of both or one rivaroxaban 
treatment arms. If the study was to continue with both interventions, then the type I error levels as 
pre-planned were to be used in the final analysis. If one intervention was stopped early for efficacy, the 
multiple testing procedure for the final analysis was to be performed as pre-planned with the assumption 
that the p-value for the primary efficacy outcome of the arm that was stopped early for overwhelming 
efficacy was smaller than 0.025. For secondary outcomes, the p-values were to be obtained from log-rank 
tests based on all available data for the stopped arm (data from confirmation analysis 6 months after 
respective interim look) and the complete data from the comparator arm. If one intervention was stopped 
early for futility, the final analysis was to be performed when at least 1,513 subjects in the two remaining 
arms has experienced an event with the final analysis to be performed according to the pre-planned 
multiple testing strategy. 
On 06 FEB 2017, the independent DSMB recommended to stop the rivaroxaban/aspirin arms early since 
the log-rank test statistic (z-value) for one of the primary comparisons had crossed the modified 
Haybittle-Peto boundary (i.e., z >4) consistently over 3 months at the first interim analysis. Considering 
the two comparisons, one for each rivaroxaban treatment arm, being made according to the modified 
Haybittle-Peto rule, the type I error level allocated at the first interim analysis is α1 = 0.0001267.

Conduct of the study 
The protocol and DSMB charter specified that approximately 1100 first occurrences of primary outcome 
events (50% of the required total 2200 subjects with a primary outcome event) would trigger the first 
formal interim analysis of efficacy. On 01 November 2016, a total of 1096 first occurrences of primary 
outcome events had been reported and analyses for the primary efficacy outcome were performed by the 
unblinded DSMB statistician. On 08 December 2016, a closed DSMB conference call was held based on an 
Assessment report

analysis of best available data from 01 December 2016, and On 30 January 2017, a closed face-to-face 
meeting of the DSMB was held based on an analysis of best available data from 17 January 2017, when 
1224 first occurrences of primary outcome events had been reported. 
On 06 February 2017, the independent COMPASS DSMB issued a letter recommending stopping the 
rivaroxaban/aspirin arms early. The antithrombotic part of the study was completed 21 July 2017. 
The DSMB also reviewed the efficacy and safety of the comparison of pantoprazole versus placebo but 
made no recommendation regarding early termination of this aspect of the overall study.  
The study protocol was amended 10 times; the most significant amendments were Amendment 6 which 
formed integrated protocol version 2.0, dated 03 JUL 2014 and Amendment 8 which formed integrated 
protocol version 3.0, dated 19 AUG 2015. The major modifications specified in Amendment 6 were 
changes in the eligibility criteria for the study population with removal of the requirement for two 
additional risk factors or disease in at least two vascular beds for PAD subjects under the age of 65, and 
addition of patients with previous carotid revascularization and an increase of the sample size from 19500 
to ~21400 randomized subjects. The main modification due to Amendment 8 was a change in the 
secondary outcomes to include 2 new composites of major thrombotic events, including new outcome 
components (ALI and CHD death). The multiple testing strategy was revised to ensure the control of the 
familywise type I error for both testing of primary and secondary efficacy variables for the final analyses 
based on 2200 events.

c Multivessel CAD =CAD and medical history of angina, PTCA, or CABG with multivessel coronary  
disease.  
Concomitant medication: 
Only a few subjects (95 subjects, 0.3%) in the ITT analysis set had a documented anticoagulant use at 
screening. All subjects discontinued the use of all anticoagulants before the run-in period. For a total of 
88.9% of the subjects in the ITT analysis set, antiplatelet use was documented at screening. The most 
commonly reported antiplatelet agent was aspirin (87% of the subjects), followed by clopidogrel (7.2% of 
subjects). There were no relevant differences between the treatment groups. Prior use of antiplatelet 
agents was slightly lower in the subgroup of subjects with PAD only (79.5%) compared to subjects with 
CAD only (89.7%) and subjects with CAD and PAD (90.8%) All 88.9% subjects discontinued the use of all 
antiplatelets before the run-in period. At least one non-study antiplatelet therapy at any visit was taken 
by 19.3% of all subjects. The most frequently reported concomitant non-study antiplatelet therapies at 
any visit were aspirin (17.5%), and clopidogrel (5.4%). There were no relevant differences between the 
treatment groups. Over time, use of non-study antiplatelet therapy increased, probably corresponding to 
the increasing number of subjects who permanently discontinued antithrombotic study treatment. 
Relevant non-study drugs were taken by almost all subjects (99.6%) in all three treatment groups during 
the rivaroxaban/aspirin follow-up period. The most frequently reported pre-specified relevant 
concomitant medications were lipid lowering agents (taken by 93.9% of all subjects), ACE inhibitors or 
ARB (78.9%) and beta blockers (75.5%). There were no relevant differences between the treatment 
groups. The use of relevant concomitant medication by CAD only mirrored the overall population. For the 
subgroup of PAD only there was a lower use of guideline recommended therapies across all treatment 
groups. 
A total of 33.3% of the subjects in the ITT analysis set reported a continuous need for PPI treatment at 
screening. The most commonly reported PPI medications were pantoprazole (11.8%) and omeprazole 
(11.6%). There were no relevant differences between the treatment groups. 
Numbers analysed 
In this trial the ITT analysis set corresponds to the full analysis set according to the ICH E9 guideline. 
None of the 27395 randomized subjects were excluded from the ITT analysis set. 
From the ITT analysis set, 44 subjects were excluded who were not treated with study rivaroxaban/ 
placebo and/or study aspirin/placebo. Thus, 27351 subjects were valid for the safety analysis set (SAF). 
The reason for exclusion from SAF was no intake of antithrombotic study drug.

Stroke includes hemorrhagic stroke. 
CHD death is a sub-category of CV death and includes death due to acute MI, sudden cardiac death, or 
death due  to a CV procedure and is only identified via adjudication. 
Ancillary analyses 
Potential testing strategies specified after the DSMB recommendation to terminate the 
antithrombotic study treatment arms 
Since an early stop at approximately 50% of the target number of primary efficacy outcome events was 
not anticipated, the study protocol and SAP did not describe any plans for the testing of secondary efficacy 
outcomes in the unlikely case of a premature termination for efficacy. For the secondary efficacy 
hypotheses, nominal p-values are reported; the test decisions according to several testing strategies 
defined after the DSMB recommendation to terminate the antithrombotic study treatment arms, but 
before the release of the first clinical database are presented in Table 10.

Analysis of the composite primary efficacy outcome for important subgroups: subjects with 
CAD and/or PAD 
The CAD/PAD diagnoses used for all analyses of this trial took into account the diagnosis made by the 
investigator at screening. In addition to the investigator diagnosis supplemental information from 
baseline evaluation and medical history records was used for a diagnosis of CAD or PAD (according to 
protocol definition) and the main focus of all analyses is based on this diagnosis for the main subgroups 
CAD yes, PAD yes and CAD and PAD. 
The distribution of subjects by CAD and PAD subgroups was comparable in the 3 treatment groups, both 
for investigator assessments and for the CAD and PAD diagnoses that took baseline evaluation and 
medical history records into account (Table 11).

Secondary efficacy outcomes are composed of the first occurrence of (i) MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, and 
CHD death, (ii), MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, and CV death and (iii) death. 
For composite outcomes and each component, the first event after randomization is considered. 
Subsequent events of the same type are not shown. 
HR (95% CI): Hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) are based on the stratified Cox proportional 
hazards model. 
Log-rank p-value: p-values (two-sided) are based on the stratified log rank test. 
Log-rank test statistic: test statistic of the stratified log-rank test 
MI = myocardial infarction, CV = cardiovascular, CHD = coronary heart disease, ALI = acute limb 
ischemia, p-yrs = patient years, bid = twice daily, od = once daily, CI = confidence interval. 
CHD death includes death due to acute MI, sudden cardiac death, or death due to a CV procedure and is 
only identified via adjudication but not reported as such by the investigator. 
All-cause mortality 
Forest plots with crude incidences and the results of the Cox proportional hazards model for 
the subgroup analysis of all-cause mortality up until the global rivaroxaban/aspirin outcomes cut-off date

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
COMPASS is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator, event-driven 
study, in which 27 395 subjects with objectively confirmed CAD or PAD were randomised 1:1:1 to 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/ASA 100 mg od, rivaroxaban 5 mg bid, or ASA 100 mg od.  
Additionally, subjects without a continuous need for treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) were 
randomised 1:1 to pantoprazole or pantoprazole placebo; this part of the study is ongoing.

The study population consists of patients with CAD, PAD or CAD and PAD. Most patients had either CAD 
only, or CAD and PAD. The majority of patients in the subgroup presented by the MAH as ‘PAD yes’ also 
had CAD.  
Some information was lacking with regards to concomitant risk factors for CV disease, most importantly 
on glycaemic control in diabetic subjects. Despite excluding patients with dual antiplatelet therapy, the 
majority of patients had suffered a previous MI and a high proportion (about 30%) had a prior CABG 
surgery. However, the data were considered acceptable and to be representative of the intended target 
population and overall, subjects with high risk of incident cardiovascular disease were enrolled in the trial.  
After a pre-planned interim analysis, the independent COMPASS DSMB recommended stopping the 
rivaroxaban/aspirin arms early. The DSMB also reviewed the efficacy and safety of the comparison of 
pantoprazole versus placebo but made no recommendation regarding early termination of this aspect of 
the overall study. Overall, the statistical methods used are appropriate as was planned analyses had the 
study been completed as planned. The key issue is multiplicity and interpretation of secondary ordered 
outcomes. When all antithrombotic treatment arms was stopped, the MAH concluded that the multiplicity 
strategy as planned was no longer valid since there was no pre-planned strategy on how to analyse key 
secondary endpoints. For the secondary efficacy endpoints therefore, nominal p-values have been 
reported. Hence, being strict, no formally valid claims can be made for secondary endpoints. Test 
decisions according to a number of post-hoc testing strategies (defined after the DSMB recommendation 
but before the release of the first clinical database) have, in addition, been presented. 
The efficacy analysis population (ITT) included all randomised subjects and the majority of randomised 
subjects, 27332/27395 (99.8%), completed the follow-up period up until the global rivaroxaban/aspirin 
outcomes cut-off date. Reasons for non-completion were consent withdrawn and lost-to follow-up. At the 
cut-off date a total of 4587 (16.7%) of randomised subjects had discontinued both rivaroxaban/placebo 
and aspirin/placebo treatment permanently; 16.9%, 17.5%, and 15.9% in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg 
bid/aspirin 100 mg od, rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group, and aspirin 100 mg od, arm respectively. In this 
population, these rates of discontinuation are considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid in combination with aspirin 100 mg od significantly reduced the primary efficacy 
outcome, the time to first occurrence of stroke, MI, or CV death, compared with treatment with aspirin 
100 mg od alone, in the ITT population. Since the study was terminated at the first interim report, not as 
many events for the primary efficacy outcome occurred as was originally planned. Treatment with 
rivaroxaban 5 mg bid did not show a statistically significant reduction in hazard ratio of the primary efficacy 
outcome compared to aspirin only.  
The analysis of the primary composite endpoint (based on the global cut-off when the DSMB 
recommended that the antithrombotic treatment arms should be stopped) is also supported by the 
sensitivity analyses performed, the analysis of the composite primary efficacy outcome based on 
investigator-reported events and, the analysis of the primary endpoint based on data up until the final 
follow-up. 
The reduction in occurrence of the primary efficacy outcome is considered clinically relevant in this heavily 
disease-burdened population. The effect is apparent early during treatment and remains consistent 
during the course of this study. The results with regards to both the primary and the secondary efficacy 
outcomes are consistent in the CAD only, CAD yes and CAD and PAD groups, but for the primary endpoint, 
the HR was less favourable and not statistically significant in the PAD only group However, the CHMP 
taking into account also the Additional expert consultation (see below), acknowledged that CAD are PAD 
are both characterised by atherosclerosis. Even though different arteries are affected, the 
Assessment report  
Xarelto 
Page 39/70 
 
pathophysiology of the disease is similar across all vascular beds. Patients with clinical evidence of 
atherosclerosis in any territory should be expected to respond in a similar fashion to anti-thrombotic 
therapy. The lack of statistical significance in patients with PAD only was attributed to the smaller sample 
size of this sub-group, compared to the other sub-group of patients included in the COMPASS study. The 
CHMP concluded that patients with PAD should also be included in the target population for the proposed 
combination of rivaroxaban and acetylsalicylic acid.  
However, the CHMP noted that CAD and PAD encompass a broad spectrum of patients, from patients with 
very mild or no symptoms, to patients with severe multi-vessel disease at high risk of infarction. Patients 
with severe coronary artery disease are also at risk of developing ischemic cardiomyopathy which is a 
common cause of heart failure in this population. Patients with mild CAD, patients with NYHA class III or 
IV symptoms or known ejection fraction <30% for example were not included in this study. Therefore the 
indication was revised to adult patients with coronary CAD or symptomatic PAD at high risk of ischaemic 
events. This reflects the studied population of the COMPASS study. CAD patients had multi-vessel CAD 
and/or prior MI. For patients < 65 years of age atherosclerosis involving at least two vascular beds or at 
least two additional cardiovascular risk factors were required. PAD patients had previous interventions 
such as bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or limb or foot amputation for arterial 
vascular disease or intermittent claudication with ankle/arm blood pressure ratio < 0.90 and/ or 
significant peripheral artery stenosis or previous carotid revascularization or asymptomatic carotid artery 
stenosis ≥ 50%. 
For the secondary efficacy outcome, the results are congruent with regards to the first two secondary 
endpoints (MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, CHD death and MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, CV death). For the third 
secondary endpoint, all-cause mortality, the picture is not as clear. All-cause mortality is lower in the riva 
2.5/aspirin cohort, but the n/100 p-years (95% CI) are overlapping in all treatment groups. The number 
of malignancy deaths is lower in the riva 2.5/aspirin cohort, which accounts for the lower number of 
non-CV deaths in this cohort. 
The pre-planned gatekeeping strategy and the failure of the 5 mg rivaroxaban arm implied (post-hoc 
proposed strategy that takes the stopping of treatments at the interim into account) that the testing of 
ordered secondary endpoints were to be made using the same conservative stopping boundary that was 
used at the interim analysis. As a consequence, no formally valid conclusion can be made for any of the 
secondary endpoints. The difference between rivaroxaban 2.5 mg treatment regimen and the aspirin 
control group in the ordered secondary composite endpoint 2 (MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, CHD death) and 
3 (MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, CV death) finds, as concluded above, support in that they share components 
with the primary composite endpoint or relies on components that are subsets of primary components. 
However, irrespective of testing strategy (to handle multiplicity) including the one that was pre-planned 
(hence ignoring the interim analysis and the early stopping of the antithrombotic treatment arms), no 
valid claim can be made regarding all-cause mortality. There is no effect on all-cause mortality in women, 
in the age group > 75 years and in patients that have not had a prior MI. All-cause mortality was higher 
in patients with CABG at baseline, PAD only, asymptomatic carotid stenosis > 50% and age groups <55 
years. Therefore the CHMP concluded, that reduction of all-cause mortality should be removed from the 
proposed indication.  
For ALI, there is a statistically significant reduction in the riva 2.5/aspirin group, but the numbers in all 
groups are very small (22 events in this group as compared to 40 in the aspirin only group). Apart from 
the analytical limitations of the secondary endpoints as described above, this small numerical decrease of 
events is not considered robust enough to allow for ‘reduction of ALI’ as a separate entity in the indication. 
Therefore the CHMP concluded, that reduction of all-cause mortality or ALI should be removed from the 
proposed indication which was revised to prevention of atherothrombotic events.  
Assessment report  
Xarelto 
Page 40/70 
 
The CHMP also noted that for patients > 75 years the reduction in HR of the primary efficacy outcome was 
less pronounced and not statistically significant. This observation could partly be due to the smaller size 
of this group of patients (N=3821) compared to patients <75 years (14457). However, the effect with 
respect to reduction of stroke was of a relevant magnitude also in these elderly patients. The CHMP also 
noted that available data suggest that the risk of bleeding increases with age. Therefore it is 
recommended that rivaroxaban should be used with caution CAD/PAD patient and the benefit-risk of the 
treatment should be individually assessed on a regular basis. 
Finally, as long term treatment is expected in these patients beyond the duration of the anti-thrombotic 
phase of the COMPASS study the CHMP advised that duration of treatment should be determined for each 
individual patient based on regular evaluations and should consider the risk for thrombotic events versus 
the bleeding risks. 
Additional expert consultation 
The Scientific Advisory Group on Cardiovascular Issues (SAG-CVS) was asked to provide their view on the 
following issues: 
1. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) is applying for an indication for Xarelto in 
combination with ASA for the prevention of major cardiovascular events in  patients with 
coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk of ischaemic events and/or documented peripheral 
artery disease (PAD) based on the results of the COMPASS study 
a.  Please discuss the risk of cardiovascular events (CVE) in patients with PAD 
without coexisting diagnosed CAD and current standard of care with respect to 
prevention of CVE 
b.  What is your opinion concerning the strength and relevance of the results in 
the COMPASS study with respect to reduction of MACE as well as the risk of 
bleedings in the group of patients with PAD only. Do you think the results 
support a potential change of the standard of care of patients with PAD? 
The Group advised that there is a continuum between CAD and PAD (with many patients having both), as 
both conditions are linked with atherosclerosis which has developed in different territories. Therefore, 
there is no biological rationale to distinguish between the two. The Group also noted that there is a 
transition in the Standard of Care for patients with PAD, with treatment aiming at reducing the risk of 
cardiovascular events in such patients. 
With regards to the results of the COMPASS study, the Group noted that the results in the pre-specified 
PAD only sub-group did not reach statistical significance for the reduction of CVE. This was however 
considered to be due to the smaller sample size of this group and chance fluctuation of treatment effect. 
The results in this sub-group of patients are consistent with those for the overall study population and the 
Group considered these as sufficient of demonstrating efficacy in the applied indication. The Group 
however noted that the evidence of an effect of rivaroxaban in acute limb ischaemia is much weaker  - it 
was a tertiary endpoint without central adjudication than for the other investigated endpoints and 
recommended that this should reflected in the presentation of the results of the COMPASS study in the 
label. 
The Group acknowledged that such results support a potential change in standard care of patients with 
PAD. Low dose rivaroxaban will then be added to aspirin. 
Assessment report  
Xarelto 
Page 41/70 
 
 
 
2. Do the results of the COMPASS study and the known increased risk of bleeding associated 
with rivaroxaban, support use of rivaroxaban in CAD/PAD patients ≥ 75 years.   
The Group advised that available data suggest that there is an increased risk of bleeding with increasing 
age. This is also known from previous experience with all factor Xa inhibitors. Despite this increased risk, 
the  Group  advised  that  this  does  not preclude  use of  rivaroxaban  in  in  CAD/PAD  patients  ≥75  years. 
Instead it was considered that labelling with warnings about this risk would be appropriate to effectively 
manage this risk. Treatment with rivaroxaban in elderly patients should depend on careful assessment of 
the individual’s personal circumstances and in particular the risk they may have for bleeding.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In the approved indications, and congruent with the mode of action for rivaroxaban, bleeding is the most 
serious and most common adverse event of interest. For other components of the cardiovascular safety 
profile of rivaroxaban, treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported in patients in previous phase III 
studies include tachycardia (uncommon), hypotension (common), renal impairment (common) and 
peripheral oedema (common). 
In the COMPASS study, the primary safety outcome was major bleeding according to modified ISTH 
criteria. The clinical hierarchy of modified ISTH major bleeding events was as follows 
• 
Fatal bleeding 
•  Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, 
respiratory, liver, pancreas, adrenal gland or kidney, retroperitoneal, intraarticular or pericardial, 
or intramuscular with compartment syndrome (non-fatal) 
•  Bleeding into the surgical site requiring re-operation (non-fatal and non-critical organ) 
•  Bleeding leading to any hospitalization (*) (non-fatal, non-critical organ, not leading to 
re-operation) 
(*) Major bleeding also includes hospitalization or presentation to an acute care facility with discharge on 
the same day, or associated with a > 1 day hospitalization. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 27351 subjects comprised the safety analysis set (rivaroxaban 2.5mg bid/aspirin: 9134 
patients, exposed for a mean of 666 days; rivaroxaban 5 mg bid: 9110 patients, exposed for a mean of 
662 days; aspirin only: 9107 patients exposed for a mean of 671 days). 
Adverse events 
Due to additional reporting of specified outcomes as (S)AE, reporting of non-serious AEs that did not lead 
to study drug discontinuation and more frequent visits in Japan, the crude incidences of AEs in Japan 
subjects are different compared with those in non-Japan subjects. Unless otherwise indicated, all tables 
displayed are with data excluding Japan subjects.

The overall summary of AEs for non-Japan subjects by the subgroups CAD/PAD, sex, and age at baseline 
is shown in Table 17. For the purpose of safety reporting, the subgroups for CAD/PAD display subjects in 
a unique category based on their presentation of ‘CAD only’, ‘PAD only’ or both ‘CAD/PAD combined’ to 
avoid reporting a subject twice.

Events of special interest were not reported separately but were included within and as part of the AE 
tables. For the ESIs ‘hepatic failure’, and ‘pancytopenia’, imbalances of potential clinical interest between 
treatment groups were noted. 
Four cases of hepatic failure were reported, two each in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/ASA 100 mg od and 
rivaroxaban 5 mg bid cohorts respectively. One of the cases occurred four months after stop of study 
treatment; two of the cases were attributed to liver failure in conjunction with other organ failure (heart 
failure and multi-organ failure due to bleeding); and in one case, liver failure was considered as related to 
underlying malignant disease. 
Six cases of pancytopenia were reported; four of those in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/ASA 100 mg od 
cohort, one in the rivaroxaban 5 mg cohort and one in the aspirin 100 mg od cohort. Of the rivaroxaban 
cases, one was considered attributed to alcohol/malnourishment; one was attributed to MDS diagnosed 
more than one year after discontinuation of study medication; one was attributed to paraneoplastic 
syndrome and viral infection; one occurred in a patient diagnosed with myelofibrosis and one occurred in 
conjunction with malignancy and chemotherapy. 
Primary safety outcome: Treatment-emergent modified ISTH major bleeding 
events 
The SAF analysis considered treatment-emergent ISTH major bleeding events which were in the database 
after closure on 22 JUL 2017. 
The number of subjects with a primary safety outcome, crude incidences and incidence rates (n/100 
patient-years) of treatment-emergent modified ISTH major bleeding event and the 4 clinical hierarchical

the SAF set are presented in Table 22.

Treatment-emergent modified ISTH major bleeding events by hierarchy and bleeding site 
Treatment-emergent fatal bleeding events 
Treatment-emergent bleeding events in the SAF analysis set were fatal in 12 subjects (0.1%) in the 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group, 13 subjects (0.1%) in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group, 
and 8 subjects (<0.1%) in the aspirin 100 mg od group. Fatal bleeding events were most frequently due 
to intracranial bleeding events, and of these mainly hemorrhagic stroke, with no notable differences 
between the 3 treatment groups (<0.1% in each group). Fatal, non-intracranial bleeding events were few 
and of diverse origin: gastrointestinal (5 cases), retroperitoneal (4 cases), respiratory tract (3 cases), 
skin or injection site (2 cases), other (2 cases) and unknown site (1 case). 
Symptomatic critical organ bleeding events (non-fatal) 
Symptomatic critical organ bleeding events (non-fatal) were reported by 0.6% of the subjects in the 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group, 0.7% in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group, and 0.5% in 
the aspirin 100 mg od group. These bleeding events were most frequently due to intracranial 
(subarachnoid, intraventricular, intracerebral/intraparenchymal hemorrhage) and/or intraocular 
bleeding events with 0.2% each in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group, 0.3% and 
<0.1%, respectively, in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group, and 0.2% and <0.1%, respectively, in the 
aspirin 100 mg od group. Symptomatic non-intracranial bleeding events were few and of diverse origin: 
intraocular (27 cases), respiratory tract (21 cases), retinal (17 cases), intraarticular (7 cases), other (7 
cases), urinary tract (5 cases), intraabdominal (5 cases), unknown site (4 cases), intramuscular (3 
cases), intraspinal (3 cases), retroperitoneal (3 cases), and pericardial (2 cases). 
Bleeding events into a surgical site requiring re-operation (non- fatal and non-critical organ) 
Bleeding events into a surgical site requiring re-operation were reported by <0.1% of the subjects in the 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group, 0.2% in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group, and <0.1% in 
the aspirin 100 mg od group. These bleeding events were most frequently gastrointestinal, skin or 
injection site bleeding events with <0.1% each in all 3 treatment groups. The number of subjects with 
bleeding events on further sites was small and the sites were of diverse origin: urinary tract (4 cases), 
genital (1 case), and other (1 case). 
Bleeding leading to any hospitalization (non-fatal, non-critical organ, not leading to 
re-operation) 
Treatment-emergent modified ISTH major events leading to any hospitalization were reported by 2.1% of 
the subjects in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group, 1.5% in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid

group, and 1.0% in the aspirin 100 mg od group with significant differences between the individual 
rivaroxaban treatment arms versus the aspirin 100 mg od group. 
Treatment-emergent modified ISTH major bleeding events were mainly driven by hospitalization with an 
overnight stay with twice as many subjects in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group 
(1.7%) compared with the aspirin 100 mg od group (0.8%). These bleeding events were most frequently 
gastrointestinal (1.2% rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od, 0.7% rivaroxaban 5 mg bid, and 0.5% 
aspirin 100 mg od). The majority of the gastrointestinal bleeding events excluded the oral cavity and the 
esophagus. Of these mainly gastric and duodenal bleeding events were reported with a higher frequency 
(0.5%) in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od as compared with 0.3% in the rivaroxaban 5 mg 
bid group and 0.2% in the aspirin 100 mg od group followed by bleeding events of unknown 
gastrointestinal site (0.3% rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od, 0.1% each rivaroxaban 5 mg bid 
and aspirin 100 mg od). The number of subjects with other sites bleeding events was of diverse origin: 
urinary tract (overall 38 cases; 9 cases rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od), skin or injection site 
(overall 24 cases; 22 cases in both rivaroxaban groups), genital (16 cases), epistaxis (13 cases), 
unknown site (10 cases), respiratory tract (4 cases), for the remaining sites 3 cases or less per site were 
documented. The number of subjects with bleeding events leading to hospitalization without overnight 
stay was lower as compared with those with an overnight stay (0.4% rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 
mg od, 0.3% rivaroxaban 5 mg bid, and 0.2% aspirin 100 mg od) with no significant differences between 
the treatment arms. Gastrointestinal and skin or injection site bleeding events were most frequently 
reported (<0.1% and 0.1% rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od, 0.1% and <0.1% rivaroxaban 5 
mg bid, and <0.1% each for aspirin 100 mg od, respectively). Further bleeding events were few and of 
diverse origin: epistaxis (15 cases), urinary tract (14 cases), intramuscular (1 case), respiratory tract (1 
case), genital (1 case), unknown site (1 case), and other (1 case). 
Other bleedings (not meeting the criteria of ISTH major bleeding events) 
All treatment-emergent bleeding events that were not adjudicated as major and not refuted during stroke 
adjudication were counted as minor. 
The number and crude incidences of subjects with treatment-emergent minor bleeding events by site is 
displayed in Table 25.

Laboratory findings 
There was no mandatory laboratory testing during the study in the global study protocol. 
Investigator-reported cardiac markers in events of myocardial infarction were largely similar across the 
antithrombotic treatment arms (data not shown). 
For Swedish subjects, additional laboratory monitoring throughout the study was performed for 
haemoglobin and haematocrit, and also creatinine clearance in subjects with e GFR below 60 ml/min, at 
screening and at 6 months intervals thereafter. There were no relevant changes from baseline or any 
difference between rivaroxaban-treated subjects (N = 246 for rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin and N = 244 for 
rivaroxaban 5 mg) and aspirin-treated subjects, with regards to either haemoglobin/haematocrit or 
eGFR. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Separate Cox proportional hazards models have been fitted to assess if the effect of the randomised 
antithrombotic treatment on the primary safety outcome is different for subjects randomised to 
pantoprazole compared with those randomised to pantoprazole placebo (subjects not randomised to 
pantoprazole/placebo were not considered).  
No interaction of the antithrombotic treatment and the pantoprazole/placebo treatment on the primary 
safety outcome was found (interaction p-value for rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od p=0.7342 
and for rivaroxaban 5 mg bid p=0.5685. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, 3.1% of all non-Japan subjects had permanent premature discontinuation of study drug intake 
due to (TE)(S)AE. Percentages were 3.4% in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group, 3.4% 
in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group, and 2.7% in the aspirin 100 mg od group (Table 27).

Table 27. Number of non-Japan subjects with premature permanent discontinuation of any 
antithrombotic study drug intake due to TEAEs by SOC (SAF) * 
Most frequently reported PTs were ‘atrial fibrillation’ (total: 0.2%; rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg 
od: 0.2%, rivaroxaban 5 mg bid: 0.2%, and aspirin 100 mg od: 0.1%) and ‘abdominal pain upper’ (total: 
<0.1%; rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od: 0.2%, rivaroxaban 5 mg bid: <0.1%, and aspirin 100 
mg od: <0.1%). All other PTs related to premature permanent discontinuations of any antithrombotic 
study drug due to TEAEs were ≤0.1%.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
No new safety concerns were identified in the COMPASS study for rivaroxaban. As expected, the main 
safety concern with rivaroxaban use is bleeding. 
There were significantly more modified ISTH major bleedings in the rivaroxaban treated participants as 
compared to the aspirin only treatment arm, with the highest HR in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 
Assessment report  
Xarelto 
Page 57/70 
 
  
  
 
 
 
100 mg od group (absolute risk difference 1.3%). The difference was statistically significant for bleedings 
that required hospitalization; more fatal and critical organ bleedings also occurred in the rivaroxaban 
treated arms, but the numbers were small.  
The combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid and aspirin 100 mg od also increased minor bleedings with 
roughly the same magnitude (HR 1.73) as major bleedings.  
Overall, there were slightly more AEs and TEAEs in the rivaroxaban cohorts vs the aspirin only cohort, 
mainly due to more reported gastrointestinal events and blood/lymphatic system disorders. The 
described AEs and TEAEs are in line with the known safety profile of rivaroxaban and there are no 
imbalances that give rise to any particular concern; however, bleedings were not reported as AEs but as 
outcomes, see above. As expected, the numbers of both bleeding and other AEs increase with increasing 
age. Therefore a waring has been included in the product information, that, the combination of 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily and ASA 100 mg once daily should be used with caution in elderly patients 
with CAD and/or PAD; the potential benefit must be weighed against the risk. 
There was number of a gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation which is not a known adverse event for 
rivaroxaban. The overall number of these events was nevertheless low and distributed across the three 
treatment arms with crude incidences of 0.36%, 0.27% and 0.23% in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/ASA 
100 mg od arm, rivaroxaban 5 mg bid arm, and ASA 100 mg od arm, respectively. Analysis of the 
individual cases did not reveal any new safety concerns, and having considered the low incidence rates od 
events which are not uncommon especially in the intended target population for rivaroxaban the CHMP 
considered that no action is required at this stage. 
As the COMPASS study excluded patients with any history of haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke (as well as 
any type o stroke within 1 month) treatment of CAD or PAD with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in 
combination with ASA is contraindicated in these patients.  
Additional expert consultations 
See discussion on clinical efficacy. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Bleeding remains the main safety concern associated with rivaroxaban. The CHMP concluded that the 
available clinical safety data were adequate to support use of rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin for 
the treatment of patients with CAD or PAD. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Particularly, a new contraindication of rivaroxaban with a history of haemorrhagic or lacunar 
stroke has been added to the product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated for all other dose strengths (10/15/20 mg) of 
Xarelto with relevant exposure information based on the provided clinical data. Furthermore, the PI for all 
dose strengths is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Xarelto 2.5 mg film-coated tablets and Xarelto 15 mg/20 
mg film-coated tablets. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.   Disease or condition 
Stable CAD (coronary artery disease) is predominantly an atherosclerotic disease with narrowings of 
coronary arteries that give rise to episodes of myocardial ischaemia causing angina pectoris. CAD can also 
be caused by microvascular dysfunction and coronary vasospasm, and other conditions than CAD can 
cause similar symptoms such as valvular disease, tachyarrhythmia and severe anaemia. PAD (peripheral 
Assessment report  
Xarelto 
Page 65/70 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
arterial disease) is also typically caused by atherosclerosis. CAD and PAD share similar risk factors; both 
increase with increasing age and could present in different severities entailing different risks of future 
major cardiovascular events (MACE). Risk of future MACE varies considerably between patients with 
stable disease as compared to those with unstable disease, and also based on evidence of more 
generalized atherosclerotic disease and previous atherothrombotic events. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment of CAD or PAD aims at reducing symptoms and preventing future cardiovascular events. For 
prevention, antithrombotic therapy, lipid-lowering therapy and antihypertensive therapy are used. At 
present, single antiplatelet therapy is the most common antithrombotic therapy in both CAD and PAD, 
with modifications in e.g. acute illness such as myocardial infarction and revascularization procedures. 
There are approved combination therapies with two antiplatelets that significantly reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular events but at the cost of an increased risk of bleeding. Despite existing available therapies, 
the disease burden carried by the more severely affected individuals with CAD or PAD is quite high, with 
an increased risk of cardiovascular events including mortality. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
One multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator, event-driven phase III 
study, snr 15786 (COMPASS). 27,395 subjects with objectively confirmed CAD or PAD were randomized 
1:1:1 to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/ASA 100 mg od, or rivaroxaban 5 mg bid, or ASA 100 mg od. 
Additionally, subjects without a continuous need for treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) were 
randomized 1:1 to pantoprazole or pantoprazole placebo. 
Subjects included were required to be >/=65 years, or <65 years with at least 2 additional risk factors or 
documented atherosclerosis in at least 2 vascular beds. CAD subjects should have objectively verified 
multi-vessel disease or previous MI. PAD subjects included had verified lower extremity arterial disease or 
carotid artery disease. Patients excluded were, importantly, those with high risk of bleeding, history of 
lacunar or haemorrhagic stroke, any stroke within one month, and patients with heart failure with known 
LV-EF <30% or NYHA III or IV symptoms.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death. 
In the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od arm, there was a clinically relevant and statistically 
significant reduction with HR 0.76 (95% CI 0.66; 0.86) when compared to the aspirin 100 od only cohort; 
primary efficacy outcome events were reduced by 1.3% and occurred in 4.1% of the subjects in the 2.5 
mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od arm as compared to 5.4% in the aspirin only arm. When divided into the 
separate components of the composite, the effect was most pronounced for stroke (absolute risk 
reduction 0.7%; HR 0.58 (0.44; 0.76). CV death was reduced by 0.5% [HR 0.78 (0.64; 0.96)] and MI was 
reduced by 0.3% [HR 0.86 (0.70; 1.05)]. 
The secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and two composites (death in coronary heart disease, 
myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke or acute limb ischaemia, and death in cardiovascular disease, 
myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke or acute limb ischaemia). For all-cause mortality, absolute 
reduction was 0.7% [HR 0.82 (0.71;0.96)] in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od arm when 
compared to aspirin 100 od only. For the two composites, absolute risk reduction in the composite 
including coronary heart disease was 1.3% [HR 0.72 (0.63; 0.83)] and for the composite including 
cardiovascular disease 1.4% [HR 0.74 (0.65; 0.85)].

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The participants in the COMPASS trial could have CAD, PAD or both CAD and PAD. 91% of the participants 
had CAD; 73% had CAD only and 18% had both CAD and PAD. 9% had PAD only. The primary efficacy 
outcome of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od was not statistically significantly reduced in the 
PAD only cohort, with an absolute risk reduction of  0.4% [HR 0.89 (0.55;1.44)] compared to aspirin 100 od 
only.  
There are analytical shortcomings with regards to the secondary endpoints, as this testing was not 
predefined in the way that was later carried out due to the premature stopping at the first interim 
analysis. ALI was numerically reduced, but the numbers were small (18 patients in the rivaroxaban 2.5 
mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od vs 40 in the ASA only cohort).  
For amputations, this was a non-adjudicated tertiary outcome. Although there was a numerical reduction 
in favour of rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 100 od treatment, these data or not robust enough to allow for an 
inclusion in the product information. 
The participants in the COMPASS trial with CAD had CAD with either previous MI or objectively verified 
multi-vessel disease. Thus, there are no efficacy data on patients with less severe CAD. Patients with 
heart failure of NYHA class III and IV were excluded from the study. For this reason, the indication was 
revised to include only patients at high risk of ischaemic events.  
The numerical reduction in all-cause mortality is of interest in interpreting the reduction of CV death and 
is appropriate to include in the product information.  
The effect for the primary endpoint seemed to be somewhat lower for patients aged 75 years and above 
(HR 0.89, CI 0.69-1.14). However, there was a relevant effect for reduction of the risk of stroke. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In general, the safety profile of rivaroxaban in the current study in CAD/PAD subjects did not markedly 
differ from that in previous studies conducted with rivaroxaban.  
Both major and minor bleedings were increased in participants treated with rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 
100 mg od compared to aspirin only. In total, 11.4% of the safety population in the rivaroxaban 2.5 
bid/aspirin 100 mg cohort experienced any bleeding vs 6.7% in the aspirin only cohort. Major bleeding 
was defined by modified ISTH criteria including hospitalization; this endpoint is considered clinically 
relevant. 2.9% of the safety population experienced a major bleeding event in the rivaroxaban 2.5 
bid/aspirin 100 mg od cohort, as compared to 1.6% in the aspirin only cohort; the HR of major bleeding 
was 1.84 (95% CI 1.50-2.26) in the rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 100 mg od compared to aspirin only.  
Bleeding that required hospitalization contributed predominantly to the relative increase in the primary 
safety outcome, but there were numerically more fatal and critical organ bleeding in the rivaroxaban 2.5 
bid/aspirin 100 mg od cohort. Fatal and critical organ bleeding events were most frequently intracranial, 
whereas the bleeding events that required hospitalization were most frequently gastrointestinal. The 
absolute risk increase in subjects ≥ 75 years of age was 2.2% in the riva2.5bid/ASA group vs ASA only; 
for patients with PAD only, the absolute risk increase in modified major bleeding was 1.5%. 
For minor bleeding, absolute risk increased by 3.7% in the rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 100 mg od 
compared to aspirin only [HR 1.73 (95% CI 1.55; 1.94)] in the rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 100 mg od 
compared to aspirin only. Gastrointestinal bleeding, skin or injection site bleeding, epistaxis and urinary 
tract bleeding were the most common sites of minor bleeding. 
Assessment report  
Xarelto 
Page 67/70 
 
  
  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Patients with high risk of bleeding were excluded from the COMPASS trial. 
The numbers of gastrointestinal events were lower than expected. It is not clear if the randomization to 
PPI/placebo in previously non-PPI-treated patients could have affected the risk of minor bleeding. 
There are no safety data on patients with previous haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke, or patients with any 
stroke within one month from randomization. These patients were excluded from the pivotal trial for 
safety reasons, due to a higher incipient risk of intracranial bleeding. Use of rivaroxaban in such patients 
is therefore contraindicated.  
More subjects in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin cohort permanently discontinued with study drug as 
compared to aspirin only. The were numerously more patients who discontinued due to ‘adverse event’, 
‘bleeding’ or ‘SAE/ESI’ in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin cohort.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Patients with CAD and PAD are at high risk of cardiovascular events despite current standard of care. 
Adding rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid to ASA 100 mg od is shown to reduce the composite primary efficacy 
outcome (composed of a reduction in stroke, MI and CV death) in a proportion that is considered to be of 
Assessment report  
Xarelto 
Page 68/70 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical value for the studied population, which are judged to be at high risk of ischaemic events. The 
absolute reduction of the primary efficacy endpoint was numerically equal to the absolute increase in the 
primary safety outcome (1.3% each).  
For patients with PAD without concomitant CAD, even if the results did not reach statistical significance, 
as the pathophysiology is the same  between the two conditions, the overall result of the study should 
apply equally to this subgroup of patients.  
In the COMPASS study, the effect on the primary efficacy outcome was not statistically significant among 
subjects ≥ 75 years of age; however, there was a clinically relevant reduction of the incidence of stroke. 
On the other hand, the risk of bleeding increased with increasing age. Therefore, the benefit risk balance 
in this population should be individually assessed on a regular basis. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit of more intense antithrombotic therapy  with the combination of Xarelto and ASA  as 
documented  is consider to counterbalance the risk of bleeding in the studied population. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xarelto is positive.

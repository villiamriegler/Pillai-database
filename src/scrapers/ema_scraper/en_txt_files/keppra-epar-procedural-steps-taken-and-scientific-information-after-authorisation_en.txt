1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of Section 4.6 to add information on 'Women 
of childbearing potential' and to update the 
Pregnancy section, to address PRAC 
recommendations from LEG-084.1;  
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
An updated to the Risk Management Plan (version

Method of administration 
The film-coated tablets must be taken orally, swallowed 
with a sufficient quantity of liquid and may be taken with or 
without food. After oral administration the bitter taste of 
levetiracetam may be experienced. The daily dose is 
administered in two equally divided doses. 
The SmPC section 4.6 has been updated as follows:  
Women of child bearing potential 
Specialist advice should be given to women who are of 
childbearing potential. Treatment with levetiracetam should 
be reviewed when a woman is planning to become 
pregnant. As with all antiepileptic medicines, sudden 
discontinuation of levetiracetam should be avoided as this 
may lead to breakthrough seizures that could have serious 
consequences for the woman and the unborn child. 
Monotherapy should be preferred whenever possible 
because therapy with multiple antiepileptic medicines AEDs 
could be associated with a higher risk of congenital 
malformations than monotherapy, depending on the 
associated antiepileptics. 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of postmarketing data on pregnant women 
exposed to levetiracetam monotherapy (more than 1800, 
among which in more than 1500 exposure occurred during 
the 1st trimester) do not suggest an increase in the risk for 
major congenital malformations. Only limited evidence is 
Page 10/47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
available on the neurodevelopment of children exposed to 
Keppra monotherapy in utero. However, current 
epidemiological studies (on about 100 children) do not 
suggest an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders 
or delays.  
Levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, if after 
careful assessment it is considered clinically needed. In 
such case, the lowest effective dose is recommended.  
Physiological changes during pregnancy may affect 
levetiracetam concentration.  Decrease in levetiracetam 
plasma concentrations has been observed during 
pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the 
third trimester (up to 60% of baseline concentration before 
pregnancy). Appropriate clinical management of pregnant 
women treated with levetiracetam should be ensured.  
Breastfeeding 
Levetiracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, 
breast-feeding is not recommended.  
However, if levetiracetam treatment is needed during 
breastfeeding, the benefit/risk of the treatment should be 
weighed considering the importance of breastfeeding. 
Fertility 
No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see 
section 5.3). No clinical data are available, potential risk for 
human is unknown. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

to as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systematic 
symptoms (DRESS). This review identified 15 reports of 
patients receiving levetiracetam who had a severe 
hypersensitivity reaction considered to be possibly a side 
effect of this medicine. It also showed that severe 
hypersensitivity reactions were more frequently reported in 
patients taking levetiracetam than in the general 
population. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that, although 
rare, severe hypersensitivity reaction should be included in 
the product information in the list of adverse drug 
reactions.

description of the quantity of sodium of Keppra concentrate 
for solution for infusion was clarified and now reflects the

Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
last renewal of the Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Keppra remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: Keppra has been 
authorised for children from 4 years old (approved 
September 2005) and more recently for children from 1 
month to 4 years old (approved September 2009). Due to 
the recent addition of these sensitive populations to the 
therapeutic indication, limited safety information is 
available in these age groups. The CHMP considers that 
more safety experience needs to be gained in children, and 
decided that the MAH should continue to submit yearly 
PSURs and 6-monthly specific safety reports for children < 
4 years old in between yearly PSURs. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Keppra, which 
requires the submission of yearly PSURs and 6-monthly 
Page 29/47

and from the post-marketing phase for this class of 
medicines was considered by the CHMP. For Keppra, the 
CHMP also considered the results of two epidemiological 
studies conducted by the MAH. Overall, the analysis of 
randomized placebo controlled trials of antiepileptic drugs 
did not exclude the possibility of an increased risk.  
In the two epidemiological studies conducted with Keppra, 
no significant difference in the time to suicide attempt was 
found between the users of Keppra and that of any other 
antiepileptics during the observation period, and no 
significant difference in the suicide attempt rates and 
survival analyses was found between the continuous or 
intermittent users of Keppra and those taking any other 
antieplieptics. 
The product information for Keppra, which already 
contained warnings about reported cases of suicide, suicide 
attempt and suicide ideation, has been updated to reflect 
the outcome of the class review.

levetiracetam does not affect the in vitro glucuronidation of 
valproic acid. 
In human hepatocytes in culture, levetiracetam had little or 
no effect on CYP1A2, SULT1E1 or UGT1A1. Levetiracetam 
caused mild induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. The in vitro 
data and in vivo interaction data on oral contraceptives, 
digoxin and warfarin indicate that no significant enzyme

1(ICR)BR mice, twice daily (in two equal sub-doses six 
hours apart) by oral gavage (10 mL/kg) for at least 104-
weeks. The study demonstrated that administration of 
levetiracetam for 2-years to mice did not result in a 
tumourogenic response and that all non-neoplastic changes 
had been seen earlier in other repeat dose studies in both 
rats and mice. Based on these findings the safety margin 
for any carcinogenic potential in the mouse was increased 
from 3 to 12 over the maximum recommended human dose 
(MRHD). As a consequence, it can be stated that 
levetiracetam has no carcinogenic potential to man at the 
MHRD.

reduce N-type Ca2+ currents and to reduce intracellular 
Ca2+ release, together with the effect against zinc and ß-
carbolines reductions in both GABA- and glycine-gated 
currents contribute to levetiracetam's antiepileptic 
mechanism of action. Furthermore, levetiracetam's

its antiepileptic activity. This information justified an update

Introduction 
active substance 
Levetiracetam, the active substance of Keppra film coated 
tablets, can be synthesised following two routes, namely 
the "tartaric acid resolution route of synthesis" or the 
"synthesis route including a chiral Multicolumn Continuous 
Chromatography (MCC) separation step".  
This type II variation proposes Aerojet Fine Chemicals, 
Rancho Cordavo (USA) as alternative manufacturing site for 
steps 4 to 7 of the synthesis process using MCC.

Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The MCC manufacturing route of levetiracetam consists of 7 
steps. The Multicolumn Continuous Chromatographic (MCC)

system is used in step 4, to obtain an extract of 
levetiracetam (S-enantiomer) from etiracetam (racemic 
mixture). Crude levetiracetam is obtained is step 5 by 
evaporation of the solvent from the step-4 extract. The 
substance is recrystallised from acetone and dried in order 
to give recrystallised levetiracetam in step 6. In step 7, the 
dried product is milled.  
Differences to the approved  manufacturing steps include 
alternative settings for step 4 of the MCC system and 
differences in batch size.  
Those changes as well as Quality control, batch results and 
stabiltity are appropriately documented and found 
acceptable.

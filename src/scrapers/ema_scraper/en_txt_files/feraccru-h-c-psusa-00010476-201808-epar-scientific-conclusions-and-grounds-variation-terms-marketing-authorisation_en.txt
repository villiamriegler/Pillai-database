Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ferric maltol, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Faeces discolouration was observed in patients treated with ferric maltol in clinical trials. Black 
discolouration of the stool is a well-known ADR of oral iron formulations. The PRAC concluded that the 
product information of products containing ferric maltol should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ferric maltol the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ferric maltol is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

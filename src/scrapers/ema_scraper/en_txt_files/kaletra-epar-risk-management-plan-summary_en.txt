Part VI:  Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Kaletra/Aluvia 
(lopinavir/ritonavir) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for lopinavir/ritonavir 
(Kaletra/Aluvia).  The RMP details important risks of lopinavir/ritonavir, how these 
risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained about 
lopinavir/ritonavir's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
lopinavir/ritonavir's summary of product characteristics (SmPCs) and its package 
leaflets (PLs) give essential information to health care professionals and patients on 
how lopinavir/ritonavir should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for lopinavir/ritonavir should be read in the context of all 
this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-
language summary, all of which are part of the European Public Assessment Report 
(EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of lopinavir/ritonavir's RMP. 
I 
The Medicine and What it Is Used For 
Lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution is indicated for treatment of HIV-1 infected adults, 
adolescents and children 14 days of age and older (see SmPC for the full 
indication).  Lopinavir/ritonavir 200 mg/100 mg film-coated tablets and 
Lopinavir/ritonavir 100 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for treatment of 
HIV-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children above the age of 2 years (see 
SmPC for the full indication).  Lopinavir/ritonavir contains lopinavir/ritonavir as the 
active substance and it is given by mouth. 
Further information about the evaluation of lopinavir/ritonavir benefits can be found 
in lopinavir/ritonavir's EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on 
the EMA website. 
II  Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or 
Further Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of lopinavir/ritonavir, together with measures to minimize such 
risks and the proposed studies for learning more about lopinavir/ritonavir's risks, 
are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the PL and SmPC addressed to patients and health care professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine's packaging; 
• 
•  The authorized pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine's legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g., with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine PV activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of lopinavir/ritonavir is not yet 
available, it is listed under "missing information" below. 
II.A  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of lopinavir/ritonavir are risks that need special risk management 
activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product 
can be safely administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or 
potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link 
with the use of lopinavir/ritonavir.  Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the 
medicine).

II.B  Summary of Important Risks 
Important identified risk:  Harm from the alcohol and propylene glycol 
contained in lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution in pre-mature newborn 
babies. 
(Toxicity in preterm neonates of lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimization 
measures 
Lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution contains: 
•  alcohol – 42%, which is 356.3 mg per mL. 
•  propylene glycol – 15%, which is 152.7 mg 
per mL. 
These can cause serious and life threatening side 
effects in premature newborn babies. 
Preterm neonates (neonates before a postmenstrual 
age [first day of the mother's last menstrual period 
to birth plus the time elapsed after birth] of 42 
weeks and before a postnatal age of at least 14 
days). 
Routine risk minimization measures:  
SmPC Section 4.2 - Posology and method of 
administration, including dosing instruction for oral 
solution based on infant's BSA and body weight for 
accurate dosing to avoid toxicity from excipients  
SmPC Section 4.4 - Special warnings and 
precautions for use, regarding particular risk of 
toxicity in relation to the amount of alcohol and 
propylene glycol contained in lopinavir/ritonavir oral 
solution 
Close monitoring instruction for infants for toxicity 
related to lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution is provided 
in Section 4.4 of SmPC 
Other routine risk minimization measures: 
•  Prescription only medicine 
•  Use of treatment should be initiated and 
supervised by specialists 
Important identified risk:  Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory 
Syndrome (IRIS) manifesting as autoimmune disorders – such as 
Graves' disease 
 
 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
HIV treatment usually improves the ability of the 
immune system to fight infections.  
This improvement can make the body over-respond 
to infections in the body which have previously been 
hidden infections. 
•  This is called IRIS or 'Immune Reconstitution 
Inflammatory Syndrome.' 
•  Patients with IRIS could be at a higher risk of 
getting some illnesses called 'auto-immune 
disorders:' 
•  This is where your immune system attacks 
healthy parts of your body 
•  This includes hyperthyroidism (Graves' 
disease). 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Patients with pre-existing infections and low baseline 
CD4 cell counts. 
Risk minimization 
measures 
Routine risk minimization: 
SmPC Section 4.4 - Special warnings and 
precautions for use, regarding patients at risk of 
immune reconstitution informatory syndrome (IRIS), 
inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual 
opportunistic infections with relevant examples of 
these conditions. 
Other routine risk minimization measures: 
•  Prescription only medicine 
•  Use of treatment should be initiated and 
supervised by specialist 
Important identified risk:  Increase in fat (lipid) levels in the blood 
(Lipid elevations) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Increased fats (lipids) in the blood have been linked 
with 'PI' HIV medicines like lopinavir/ritonavir. 
There are several causes of this: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the HIV infection itself 
infections because of the body's immune 
system being less able to fight infections 
treatments for HIV 
the stage of the HIV 
 
•  any heart problems 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Particular caution should be paid to patients with 
high values at baseline and with history of lipid 
disorders. 
Risk minimization 
measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
SmPC Section 4.4 - Special warnings and 
precautions for use, regarding: 
• 
• 
increase blood levels of lipids during 
antiretroviral therapy.  
Information to monitor blood lipids during 
treatment using HIV guideline.  Lipid disorders 
should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
Information on the appropriate lipid-lowering agents 
and lopinavir/ritonavir and important DDIs - lipid-
lowering agents interactions are provided in 
Section 4.5 
Other routine risk minimization measures: 
•  Prescription only medicine 
•  Use of treatment should be initiated and 
supervised by specialists 
Important potential risk:  QT prolongations with supratherapeutic doses 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
QTcF interval was evaluated in a study in 39 healthy 
adults taking either 400/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir 
twice daily or 800/200 mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice 
daily.  No subject experienced an increase in QTcF of 
≥ 60 msec from baseline or a QTcF interval 
exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold 
of 500 msec. 
As noted in the prescribing information, through 
drug-drug interactions lopinavir/ritonavir can 
increase concentrations of certain co-administered 
medicinal products, come of which are known to 
cause QT prolongation, and this may result in an 
increase of their associated cardiac adverse 
reactions.  Health care professionals should take 
care when prescribing lopinavir/ritonavir and 
medicines that can cause QT prolongation.  These 
include: 
•  chlorpheniramine – for allergies 
•  quinidine – for heart beat problems 
•  antibiotics such as erythromycin and 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
clarithromycin 
•  antibacterials called 'fluoroquinolones' such as 
moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin 
Individuals with congenital long QT syndrome, 
hypokalemia, or who may be taking concomitant 
drugs that have associated QTc prolongation as an 
adverse event. 
Risk minimization 
measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  Prescription only medicine 
•  Use of treatment should be initiated and 
supervised by specialists 
Important potential risk:  PR prolongation at therapeutic dosing 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to cause modest 
asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in 
some patients (text in CCDS).  Rare reports of 
second- or third-degree atrioventricular block in 
patients with underlying structural heart disease and 
pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in 
patients receiving drugs known to prolong the PR 
interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have been 
reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir.  
Lopinavir/ritonavir should be used with caution in 
such patients. 
Individuals with pre-existing structural heart disease 
and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or 
who are taking concomitant drugs that have PR 
prolongation as an associated adverse event. 
First-degree AV block, defined as prolongation of the 
PR interval on the surface electrocardiogram, is not 
an uncommon finding on electrocardiographic 
screening of asymptomatic young individuals.  
Prevalences of 0.65% to 1.1% have been reported.  
In the majority of cases the PR prolongation may be 
rendered normal by autonomic intervention.  Long-
term follow-up studies have indicated that although 
the risk of subsequent coronary artery disease (CAD) 
may be slightly increased, the risk of sudden death, 
syncope, or advanced AV block is not (Bexton 1984). 
Risk minimization 
measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
SmPC Section 4.4 - Special warnings and 
 
precautions for use, regarding patients' pre-existing 
conditions for PR prolongation while taking 
lopinavir/ritonavir 
Other routine risk minimization measures: 
•  Prescription only medicine 
•  Use of treatment should be initiated and 
supervised by specialists 
Important potential risk:  Errors with dosing that cause too much 
lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution to be swallowed by infants.  
(Risk of overdose resulting from medication errors with lopinavir/ritonavir oral 
solution in patients 14 days to 9 weeks of age and weighing less than 3.8 kg) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
As with all liquid medicines administered with a 
syringe, it is possible to draw up too much medicine 
into the syringe and administer an overdose of 
medicine.  Lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution contains 
ingredients called ethanol and propylene glycol, 
which may be harmful when given in excessive 
amounts to young children.  It is extremely 
important that the correct dose of lopinavir/ritonavir 
oral solution is given to young children.  Children 
should attend all of their HIV clinic appointments so 
that the dose of HIV medication can be adjusted as 
they grow and gain weight.

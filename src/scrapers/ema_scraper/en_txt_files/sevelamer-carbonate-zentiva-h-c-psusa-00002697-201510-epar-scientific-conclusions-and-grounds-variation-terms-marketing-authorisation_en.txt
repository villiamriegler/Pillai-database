Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for sevelamer, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
During the reporting period, a total of 8 new cases of serious gastrointestinal disorders associated with 
the presence of sevelamer crystals were reported. In those cases, sevelamer crystals appeared to have 
been associated with several non-listed gastrointestinal events such as colitis, ulcer, necrosis and 
peritonitis. Further evidence is still needed to demonstrate that sevelamer crystals are the causal 
agent for the gastrointestinal disorders. However, given the seriousness of these events and the 
number of reported cases, the risk of formation of sevelamer crystals associated with serious 
gastrointestinal disorders was considered relevance to the prescriber. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSURs, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing sevelamer hydrochloride and carbonate were 
warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for sevelamer the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing sevelamer is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

1.  Introduction 
On 17 March 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Fycompa, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. This study is part of PIP. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study E2007-G000-307 [An Open-label Extension Phase of the Double-blind, 
Placebo-Controlled, Dose Escalation, Parallel-Group Studies to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
E2007 (Perampanel) Given as Adjunctive Therapy in Subjects with Refractory Partial Seizures] is  part 
of a clinical development program. 
Study E2007-G000-307 (Study 307), an Eisai-sponsored clinical study, was recently completed as part 
of a clinical development program. This study was open label extension for the three double blind 
efficacy studies carried out as part of the initial development programme.

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
No additional information has been supplied. The already marketed 2mg and 4mg tablets were used in 
the study. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Perampanel (E2007), 2-(2-Oxo-1-phenyl-5-pyridin-2-yl-1, 2-dihydropyridin-3-yl) benzonitrile hydrate 
(4:3), an highly selective alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type 
glutamate receptor antagonist, is an anticonvulsant drug approved internationally as adjunctive 
therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients 12 years and older.  
Perampanel is currently available on the market in the EU, USA, Canada, Switzerland, and in over 40 
other countries, as Fycompa® film-coated tablets (containing 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, and 12 
mg perampanel). 
CHMP’s comment: 
The applicant initially proposed that the submitted information did not change the risk benefit balance 
and did not warrant any change in the product information. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study E2007-G000-307 
AN OPEN-LABEL EXTENSION PHASE OF THE DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, DOSE 
ESCALATION, PARALLEL-GROUP STUDIES TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF E2007 
(PERAMPANEL) GIVEN AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN SUBJECTS WITH REFRACTORY PARTIAL SEIZURES 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of perampanel (up to12mg/day) given 
as adjunctive treatment in subjects with refractory partial seizures. 
EMA/CHMP/732770/2015   
Page 4/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The secondary objective is to evaluate the maintenance of effect of perampanel for the control of 
refractory partial seizures. 
The exploratory objective is to evaluate the potential withdrawal symptoms of perampanel in subjects 
with refractory partial seizures. (revised per Amendments 02 and 03) 
In addition, this study will: 
• Evaluate the long-term effect of perampanel on growth and development including sexual staging in 
adolescents (ie, 12 to 17 years at the time of consent/assent in the preceding double-blind study, in 
countries where data are available). (added per Amendment 03) 
• Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of perampanel using a population PK approach and explore the 
PK/PD relationship in adolescents (in countries where data are available). (added per Amendment 03) 
Study design 
This was an open-label extension (OLE) study for subjects who completed 1 of the following double-
blind (DB), placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies: E2007-G000-304, E2007-G000-305, or E2007-G000-
306 (hereafter referred to as 304, 305, and 306, respectively). This OLE study consisted of 2 phases: 
an Open-label Treatment Phase (comprised of a 16-week blinded Conversion Period and a 256-week 
Maintenance Period) and a Follow-up Phase (4 weeks). 
The open-label Maintenance Period began at completion of the blinded Conversion Period. During the 
open-label Maintenance Period, subjects were treated with the perampanel dose that provided the best 
combination of individual efficacy and tolerability. Subjects who either withdrew from the study 
prematurely or completed the Maintenance Period returned for a final visit at the end of the 4-week 
open-label Follow-up Phase. 
Subjects entered the OLE study on the concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen they were on 
during the core DB study, consisting of at least 1, to a maximum of 3, concomitant AED(s). The 
dose(s) of the concomitant AED(s) could have been adjusted. Following Amendment 03, the 
concomitant AED(s) itself could have been discontinued or changed at the investigator’s discretion 
during the OLE study. 
The sponsor terminated the study in 2012 following receipt of a positive opinion for perampanel from 
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. An end-of-treatment (EOT) visit was scheduled 
within 2 to 6 weeks for all subjects who remained in the Maintenance Period. If it was the opinion of 
the treating physician that a subject would benefit significantly from further treatment with 
perampanel after the trial concluded, perampanel treatment was made available under Eisai’s 
compassionate use policy in accordance with local country legislative provisions until the time that 
perampanel was commercially available in the country in which the subject resided. 
No Follow-up Phase was required for subjects who continued perampanel treatment under an 
Expanded Access Protocol. 
Study population / Sample size 
Male and female subjects were eligible for this OLE study if they completed the DB Phase (Visit 8) of 
Study 304, 305, or 306 and showed compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria for that study 
(other than criteria related to seizure frequency); provided informed consent for participation in the 
OLE study; were currently receiving treatment with a stable dose of 1 to a maximum of 3 marketed 
AEDs (on a stable dose of 2 or 3 marketed AEDs in Lithuania); and were considered reliable and able 
EMA/CHMP/732770/2015   
Page 5/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
to record seizure data and report adverse event (AE) information (or have a caretaker able to perform 
these duties).Planned: Up to 1430 subjects.  
Enrolled in OLE study: 1218 subjects, including 124 adolescent subjects, defined as those aged 12 to 
17 years at the time of providing informed consent/assent in the core DB study. Treated in OLE study: 
1216 subjects. 
Treatments 
Perampanel was supplied as 2-mg tablets (lot numbers P7Y005ZZB, P7Z002ZZA, P7Z004ZZA, 
P82002ZZA, P82003ZZA, P86004ZZA, P92003ZZA, P92008ZZA, P92009ZZA, P96004ZZA, P96005ZZA, 
P99009ZZA, P99010ZZA) or 4-mg tablets (lot numbers P7Y006ZZA, P7Z005ZZA, P83003ZZA, 
P83005ZZA, P86006ZZA, P99011ZZA, P99012ZZA). Matching placebo 2-mg tablets (lot numbers 
P7Y003ZZB, P8Z001ZZA, P77005ZZA, P86002ZZA, P92007ZZA,P96003ZZA). 
All doses were taken once daily, by mouth, before bedtime, and with food. In the Conversion Period, 
all titrations were to be based on individual tolerance, as per the investigator’s clinical judgment and 
the subject’s willingness to increase the perampanel doses up to 12 mg. During the Maintenance 
Period, subjects were to be treated with the perampanel dose that provided the best combination of 
individual safety, tolerability, and efficacy up to a maximum dose of 12 mg/day. 
Doses could be down- or up-titrated until the MTD dose was identified for each subject. 
Subjects who could not tolerate 2 mg/day were discontinued. Subjects previously assigned to a 
placebo arm were to be up-titrated in 2-mg increments to a maximum of 12 mg/day in a blinded 
fashion on the basis of individual tolerance. For subjects who achieved 12 mg/day during the DB study, 
their dose was to be stably maintained (unless a dose adjustment was necessary). For subjects who 
achieved perampanel doses below 12 mg, the up-titration was to be made in 2 mg increments in a 
blinded fashion until an optimal dose was found (up to a maximum of 12 mg) (revised per 
Amendments 01 and 02). 
The planned total duration of treatment during the OLE study was up to 5 years or until the product 
became available commercially or the study was closed (except in the United Kingdom and India where 
the total duration was 272 weeks [16 week Conversion Period + 256-week Maintenance Period]). 
Outcomes / Endpoints 
Efficacy 
Efficacy assessments included seizure counts from subject diaries. The key efficacy endpoints included 
the percent change in seizure frequency (all seizures types) per 28 days during treatment relative to 
baseline as well as the proportion of subjects who experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure 
frequency during treatment per 28 days relative to baseline (responder). 
Safety 
Safety assessments included examination of the incidence rates of treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), and withdrawals due to AEs; changes in 
vital signs and body weight and incidence rates of clinically significant vital sign values; changes in 
laboratory test parameters and incidence of clinically notable laboratory abnormalities; change from 
baseline in electrocardiogram (ECG) interval values, incidence rates of abnormal QT interval values 
corrected for heart rate using Fridericia (QTcF) or Bazett (QTcB) formulae, and rates of abnormal ECG 
interpretations; shift from baseline in withdrawal questionnaire responses; shift from baseline in 
EMA/CHMP/732770/2015   
Page 6/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Tanner Staging for adolescent subjects; changes from baseline in thyroid hormone and insulin-like 
growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and change from baseline in body weight and height in adolescent subjects; 
and rates of concomitant medication use. A TEAE was defined as an AE that either began on or after 
the date of first dose of perampanel and up to 30 days after the last dose of perampanel, or began 
before the date of first perampanel dose and increased in severity during the perampanel treatment. 
For subjects randomized to 1 of the perampanel treatment groups in the preceding core DB study, the 
first dose date of perampanel is from the core DB study. For subjects randomized to placebo in the 
preceding core DB study, the first dose date of perampanel was from the OLE study. AEs were 
classified into standardized terminology from the verbatim description (investigator term) according to 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA™) Coding Dictionary, version 13.1. TEAEs 
were summarized by System Organ Class (SOC) and MedDRA preferred term. 
Statistical Methods 
Details concerning the data analyses are specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Efficacy 
analyses were based on the Full Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set, while safety analyses were based 
on the Safety Analysis Set. The Safety Analysis Set was defined as subjects who provided informed 
consent for the OLE study, received at least 1 dose of perampanel in the OLE study, and had at least 1 
postdose safety assessment in the OLE study (N = 1216 for overall population; N = 124 for adolescent 
population). Two subjects were enrolled and treated in the OLE study but were not included in the 
Safety Analysis Set as they did not have any postbaseline safety data after the first OLE dose as of the 
interim cut-off date. 
The Full ITT Analysis Set was defined as subjects who provided informed consent for the OLE, received 
at least 1 dose of perampanel in the OLE study, and had valid seizure data during the perampanel 
treatment duration (DB and/or OLE studies) (N = 1217 for overall population; N = 124 for 
adolescents). As inclusion in the Full ITT Analysis Set for subjects treated in the OLE study was 
dependent on availability of seizure data during perampanel treatment in the DB and/or OLE studies, 
the number of subjects in this analysis set was higher than that in the Safety Analysis Set (which 
required availability of data in the OLE study). 
All data analyses were descriptive in nature, with summary statistics presented for continuous 
endpoints and frequency counts presented for categorical endpoints. Two general approaches were 
used to analyse efficacy data. The first examined seizure data by maximum perampanel dose received 
and used the Pre-perampanel Baseline for evaluating change. The second approach examined seizure 
data as a function of randomised treatment group in the core DB study and used the Pre-
randomisation Phase of the core DB study as the baseline for evaluating change. 
The Pre-perampanel Baseline was defined as follows unless otherwise specified: (1) for subjects who 
had been assigned to placebo treatment in the core DB study, the Pre-perampanel Baseline was 
computed from all data during the core DB study, and (2) for subjects who had been assigned to 
perampanel in the core DB study, the Preperampanel Baseline was computed from the Pre-
randomisation Phase of the core DB study. For all efficacy analyses, the perampanel treatment 
duration consisted of (1) the DB (Titration + Maintenance Periods) plus the OLE (Conversion + 
Maintenance Periods) for subjects assigned to perampanel in the core DB study and who had a ≤14- 
day gap in perampanel exposure between the DB and OLE studies; (2) the OLE Treatment Phase for 
subjects assigned to perampanel in the core DB study and who had a >14-day gap in perampanel 
exposure between the DB and OLE studies; or (3) the OLE Treatment Phase for subjects assigned to 
placebo in the core DB study. 
EMA/CHMP/732770/2015   
Page 7/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
For analyses using the Pre-randomisation Phase of the core DB study for determining baseline seizure 
frequency, efficacy data were summarised by randomised treatment group in the core DB study for the 
DB Titration Period, DB Maintenance Period, OLE Conversion Period, and by 13-week intervals during 
the OLE Maintenance Period. 
Additional summaries of the efficacy endpoints were provided for subgroups defined by age (<18, 18-
64, and >64 years), sex (male/female), race (White; Asian or Pacific Islander; Other), and number of 
AEDs (1, 2, 3) at DB Baseline. Summaries of the key efficacy endpoints were also examined for the 
subgroup of adolescent subjects. 
Subgroup analyses were performed using both efficacy analysis approaches (ie, using Pre-perampanel 
Baseline and Pre-randomisation Phase Baseline). Exploratory efficacy endpoints, and their analyses, 
are defined in the SAP. 
Safety data were summarised by maximum daily dose (defined as <4 mg/day, 4 mg/day, >4 to 8 
g/day, and >8 to 12 mg/day) and included data from the entire perampanel treatment duration. The 
perampanel treatment duration for AE analyses was defined as all exposure to perampanel in the core 
DB study and current OLE study. The perampanel treatment duration for all other safety endpoints was 
similar to that specified for the efficacy analyses, except that for subjects assigned to perampanel 
treatment in the core DB study who had a >14-day gap in exposure between the core and current OLE 
study, the treatment duration was defined as either the DB or OLE treatment phase, whichever was 
longer. Safety endpoints were also summarized for the subgroup of adolescent subjects. 
Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses 
There were 3 global amendments, and 6 country-specific amendments, to the original protocol (dated 
15 Feb 2008). The SAP defined ITT analysis set is referred to as the Full ITT Analysis Set. 
CHMP’s comments: 
The primary objective of the study was to examine safety and tolerability of the treatment in the long 
term administration. In that sense and in view of the design, this study was primarily a safety study. 
As planned, the study was discontinued once the product became commercially available. 
The transition from double blind to open label is acceptable from the point of view of the current study. 
The acceptability of the conversion from the point of view of the original double blind studies has been 
assessed and accepted previously. 
Significant numbers of patients have been enrolled in the study, but considering that completion of the 
double blind phase was the entry requirement, the study population in this open label phase does not 
necessarily reflect the population that will be exposed to the product in the clinical practice. 
The basic efficacy assessment measures were appropriate in respect of the objectives of the study. The 
more extensive safety monitoring was also appropriate in this context. 
Statistical methods are well described. All analyses were descriptive in nature which is appropriate for 
the type of the study.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 1218 subjects provided informed consent, were eligible to participate, and were enrolled in 
Study 307, including 311 subjects from Study 304 (105 placebo, 206 perampanel), 312 subjects from 
Study 305 (118 placebo, 194 perampanel), and 595 subjects from Study 306 (157 placebo, 438 
perampanel). The enrolment in Study 307 represented between 96% and 97% of subjects who 
completed the DB Phase of each Phase 3 study (311/320 subjects for Study 304, 312/322 subjects for 
Study 305, and 595/623 subjects for Study 306). No new subjects have been enrolled since the 
previous interim synoptic CSR dated 02 May 2011. Two enrolled subjects (12016004, 40046017) were 
lost to follow-up and did not have any postbaseline safety data after the first OLE dose and were not 
included in the Safety Analysis Set. 
Table below summarises subject disposition for the Safety Analysis Set, 35 of the 1216 subjects in the 
Safety Analysis Set had completed the study, 1181 (97.1%) subjects had been discontinued from the 
OLE study. 
Table 2:   Subject Disposition and Primary Reason for Discontinuation (Safety Analysis Set) 
The most common primary reason for discontinuation of perampanel treatment in the OLE study was 
administrative / other (502 subjects, 41.3%) followed by subject choice (252 subjects, 20.7%). 
Subjects who discontinued as a result of the study closure, availability of perampanel commercially in 
their country, or entering Eisai’s compassionate use program were removed from the study 
administratively, and the reason for discontinuation is captured under the Administrative/Other 
category. A total of 478 of the 502 subjects who were discontinued due to ‘Administrative/Other’ 
EMA/CHMP/732770/2015   
Page 9/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
reasons were discontinued due to one of these administrative reasons. These subjects are considered 
to have completed the study to the extent their participation was allowed.  
For 194 subjects (16.0%), AEs were the primary reason for withdrawal from the study. This number is 
lower than the 231 subjects who were reported to have been discontinued from study treatment due to 
an AE (Table below) due to differences in the data source (End of Study Case Report Form (CRF) page 
versus AE CRF page). Of the 231 subjects who were discontinued from study treatment due to an AE, 
194 subjects had "adverse event" recorded as their primary reason for discontinuation and 39 subjects 
had "adverse event" recorded as their secondary reason for discontinuation. An additional 5 subjects 
had "adverse event" recorded as the primary reason for discontinuation per the End of Study CRF), but 
the investigators did not record these events as having an outcome of discontinuation on the AE CRF. 
Four of these 5 subjects had a fatal AE (27596005, 51284006, 51284011, and 51394009). The 
remaining subject (44046004) was withdrawn after 40 days of open-label treatment; all reported AEs 
during the OLE Conversion Period were mild in severity (gait disturbance, stress, diarrhea, and gastric 
disorder) and did not have an taken of discontinuation or drug interrupted; the secondary reason for 
discontinuation was ‘Subject choice’. 
Because >90% of subjects in Study 307 received a maximum daily dose of >8 to 12 mg/day 
perampanel, inclusive, comparisons of results across maximum dose groups are not meaningful. 
The frequency distribution of reasons for discontinuation in the OLE study was similar for subjects who 
had received prior treatment with placebo or perampanel. 
All of the 124 adolescents included in the Adolescent Safety Analysis Set had been discontinued from 
perampanel treatment in the OLE study, of which 57 (46.0%) withdrew due to administrative/other 
reasons. Other common reasons for discontinuation among adolescent subjects were subject choice 
(n=30, 24.2%), AEs (n=18, 14.5 %), and inadequate therapeutic response (n=17, 13.7%). 
CHMP’s comments: 
The majority of subjects (97.1%) are counted as discontinued. The study was terminated due to the 
product becoming commercially available and 478 subjects were recorded as discontinued on these 
grounds. The second largest group of discontinuations comes from the subject choice (252 subjects or 
20.7%). AEs were the reason for discontinuation in 231 subjects (19%).  
The subject disposition is well described in the report. The study was not designed to detect any safety 
differences between treatment groups and the results are primarily descriptive. 
Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics and baseline epilepsy-specific history are summarised for subjects in 
the Safety Analysis Set in the Table below. The demographic characteristics at DB Baseline were 
similar for the Enrolled Subjects and Full ITT Analysis Set, and did not differ as a function of previous 
DB treatment with placebo or perampanel. 
EMA/CHMP/732770/2015   
Page 10/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Table 3:   Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (Safety Analysis Set) 
The mean age among adolescent subjects was 14.9 years (range: 12 to 17 years). Approximately 60% 
(72/124, 58.1%) of adolescents were less than 16 years of age. Other than age, the demographic and 
baseline characteristics for the Adolescent Safety Analysis Set were similar to those for the overall 
Safety Analysis Set. 
Treatment Compliance and Concomitant Medications  
Diary compliance was ascertained from the days on which valid seizure counts were recorded in the 
subject diary, and the mean compliance was approximately 98% across the entire OLE study in the Full 
ITT Analysis Set. Treatment compliance, ascertained from counts of tablets dispensed and tablets 
returned, averaged approximately 99% during the Conversion Period for the Full ITT Analysis Set, and 
at least 75.9% of subjects were 100% compliant with study medication at Visits 6 to 22 of the 
Maintenance Period (i.e., visits for which at least 25 subjects had data).Diary compliance and study 
medication compliance for the Adolescent Full ITT Analysis Set was consistent with that for the Full ITT 
Analysis Set. 
EMA/CHMP/732770/2015   
Page 11/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Overall, 13.3% of the subjects in the Safety Analysis Set were taking 1 AED, 50.4% were taking 2 
AEDs, and 36.3% were taking 3 AEDs. The most common AEDs taken at DB Baseline were 
carbamazepine (34.0%), valproic acid (33.3%), lamotrigine (31.3%), levetiracetam (29.2%), 
topiramate (20.2%), and oxcarbazepine (17.9%); all other background AEDs were taken by <10% of 
subjects. 
The distribution of concomitant AED use at DB Baseline in the Adolescent Safety Analysis Set was 
similar to that described for the overall Safety Analysis Set. 
CHMP’s comment: 
The compliance was recorded and it was satisfactory. The concomitant medication was frequently 
taken, as expected for the type of the study. Considering the safety profiles of these additional 
medications the use of concomitant medications introduces an important level of complexity to the 
interpretation of the safety events recorded in this study. 
Efficacy results 
Table below summarises the median percent change from the Pre-perampanel Baseline in seizure 
frequency per 28 days by 13-week interval through the end of Year 1, and for Weeks 92-104 (end of 
Year 2), Weeks 144-156 (end of Year 3), Weeks 196-208 (end of Year 4), Weeks 222-234, and Weeks 
248-260 (end of Year 5) for the entire Full ITT Analysis Set; data are shown for all partial seizures, 
complex partial plus secondarily generalised seizures, and secondarily generalised seizures. These data 
indicate that the benefit of perampanel is sustained over time, although it should be noted that the 
number of subjects with available data declined over time. The change in the percent reduction in the 
frequency of all 3 seizure types during the first 3 to 6 months following initiation of adjunctive 
perampanel treatment is maintained for 4 years. The largest median percent decrease in seizure 
frequency was observed in subjects with secondarily generalised seizures. The median percent change 
in all partial seizures per 28 days by 13-week interval is plotted in the figure below among the subsets 
of subjects in the Full ITT Analysis Set who received at least 26 weeks, 39 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 3 
years, 4 years, and 5 years of treatment. 
Table below also summarises the responder rate by 13-week interval through the end of Year 1, and 
for Weeks 92-104 (end of Year 2), Weeks 144-156 (end of Year 3), Weeks 196-208 (end of Year 4), 
Weeks 222-234, and Weeks 248-260 (end of Year 5) by seizure type for the entire Full ITT Analysis 
Set. These data were consistent with those for percent change in seizure frequency, and showed that 
the responder rate was generally stable across time from about Week 26 through Week 208 for each 
seizure type.

Figure 1:  Figure: Median Percent Change from Pre-perampanel Baseline in Seizure 
Frequency per 28 Days by 13-week Interval During Perampanel Treatment Duration – 
Full ITT Analysis Set 
Among the 1217 subjects in the Full ITT Analysis Set, 8.0% achieved seizure freedom (100% reduction 
in frequency of all partial-onset seizures) during the Week 27 to 39 analysis window at an optimised 
dose of perampanel (up to 12 mg/day). Similarly, seizure freedom was achieved during the Weeks 40 
to 52 analysis window for 9.4% of the 894 subjects who received at least 1 year of perampanel 
exposure, and during Weeks 53-104 for 6.9% of the 681 subjects who received at least 2 years of 
perampanel exposure. 
Data for age, sex, and race subgroups were generally consistent with those for the overall population 
in showing a similar stable pattern over time for improvement in seizure control as reflected by the 
median percent change in seizure frequency and responder rate. Improvements in seizure control were 
seen in all subgroups based on the number of background AEDs at DB Baseline. The clinical relevance 
of these observations is difficult to interpret as changes in background AED therapy, including the 
addition or removal of AEDs, was permitted during the OLE study. 
Table below summarises, by previous DB treatment group (placebo or overall perampanel), the median 
percent change in total seizure frequency per 28 days and the percentage of responders for the DB 
Maintenance Period (when dose was stable), the Conversion Period of the OLE study, and by 13-week 
intervals through Week 208 (end of Year 4) for the Maintenance Period of the OLE study. Among 
subjects who received prior DB treatment with placebo, both the median percent reduction in total 
seizure frequency and the responder rate increased to a level similar to that for subjects receiving 
previous DB treatment with perampanel by the end of the Conversion Period of the OLE study. Efficacy

was maintained over time; a greater reduction in seizure frequency and an increased responder rate 
was observed with long-term treatment with perampanel. 
Table 5:   Percent Change from Double-blind Prerandomization Phase in Total Seizure 
Frequency per 28 days and Responder Rate Through Week 208 of Open-label Study: Full ITT 
Analysis Set 
By the first year of treatment in the OLE period (ie, OLE Maintenance Weeks 40-52), 11.8% of subjects 
who had received prior DB treatment with placebo and 11.3% of subjects who had received prior DB 
treatment with perampanel had achieved seizure freedom (100% reduction in frequency of all partial-
onset seizures). During the second year of OLE treatment (OLE Maintenance Weeks 53-104), 8.9% and 
8.6% of subjects who had received prior DB treatment with placebo or perampanel, respectively, had 
achieved seizure freedom. 
Because these subgroup analyses were done by DB treatment group, the number of subjects was small 
(<15) for some of the subgroups. Results were generally consistent for all subgroups in showing 
improvements in seizure control following initiation of perampanel therapy in the OLE study for 
subjects who received DB placebo, and sustained improvements in seizure control during the OLE 
study for subjects who had received DB perampanel. 
For the entire Adolescent Full ITT Analysis Set, the median percent change in total seizure frequency 
per 28 days relative to the Pre-perampanel Baseline (median seizure frequency, 19.36) was -30.72% 
during Weeks 1 to 13 (n=124), -33.06% during Weeks 14 to 26 (n=115), -45.33% during Weeks 27 
to 39 (n=110), -41.79% during Weeks 40 to 52 (n=101), -62.96% during Weeks 92-104 (n=75), and 
-64.89% during Weeks 144-156 (n=53). The responder rate (all partial seizures) during these same 
intervals for the Adolescent Full ITT Analysis Set was 29.8%, 38.3%, 47.3%, 39.6%, 60.0%, and 
64.2%, respectively. Data were consistent in showing improvements in seizure control following 
initiation of perampanel therapy in the OLE study for adolescent subjects who received DB placebo, 
and sustained improvements in seizure control during the OLE study for adolescent subjects who had 
received DB perampanel.

CHMP’s comment: 
The numbers presented for the percentage change in the median frequency of seizures and the 
responder rate do not indicate loss of efficacy over the time.  
However, the attrition of participants form the study over the time introduces bias by increasing the 
number of responders in the remaining patient population. There was no control group and due to the 
way the doses were selected it is not possible to draw conclusions about comparable efficacy of various 
dose levels. Furthermore, the changes in the background AED were allowed, so the recorded relative 
improvements cannot be entirely attributed to the study treatment even if other limitations were not 
present. 
While the recorded improvements seem to level in the “prior-placebo” and the “prior-perampanel” 
subgroup in the improvement of the frequency of seizures, the responder rate remains consistently 
higher in the “prior-perampanel” subgroup, indicating that there was a selection bias favouring 
responders at the time of inclusion into the study. 
In view of the significant limitations in the design of the study in regards to investigation of efficacy, it 
is not possible to draw any reliable conclusions that would change the present assessment of risk and 
benefit balance in regards to the efficacy. 
Safety results 
Approximately three quarters of subjects in the Safety Analysis Set (n=889, 73.1%) received more 
than 52 weeks (1 year) of perampanel treatment, 700 (57.6%) subjects received more than 100 
weeks (~2 years) of perampanel treatment, and 401 (33.0%) subjects received more than 160 weeks 
(~3 years) of perampanel treatment. The mean (SD) cumulative duration of exposure to perampanel 
for the Safety Analysis Set was 115.41 weeks (range: 1.1, 269.3 weeks). The total exposure to 
perampanel was 140334 subject weeks (~2699 subject-years). 
The mean ± SD dose of perampanel across the entire OLE Treatment Phase, when the dose of 
perampanel was titrated to maximum individual subject efficacy and tolerability, was 10.15 ± 2.294 
mg (range: 1.9, 12.0) for the Safety Analysis Set. The stability of the perampanel dose over the up to 
~4-year OLE Treatment Phase is underscored by the similarity of the mean ± SD dose during the initial 
16-week Conversion Period (9.85 ± 2.168 mg) and the subsequent Maintenance Period (10.52 ± 2.236 
mg). The mean dose across the entire perampanel treatment duration (9.47 ± 2.354 mg) was less 
than that for the OLE Treatment Phase since it included data from the DB core studies which included a 
fixed dose DB treatment phase with lower doses. 
Among the 124 subjects who comprised the Adolescent Safety Analysis Set, the mean (± SD) 
cumulative duration of exposure to perampanel was 119.09 (± 70.392) weeks (range: 2.7, 251.6 
weeks). No adolescent subject had a gap of >7 days between the double-blind and OLE studies. The 
mean dose of perampanel across the entire OLE Treatment Phase among adolescent subjects of 10.31 
± 2.353 mg (range: 2.5, 12.0) was similar to that for the overall Safety Analysis Set. 
Table below summarises the overall TEAE profile for the Safety Analysis Set. TEAEs included those AEs 
that occurred from the first day of perampanel administration (in DB and/or OLE study) to 30 days 
after the last dose of perampanel, or that were present before the first day of perampanel 
administration but worsened in severity during the study.

Table 6:   Adverse Event Summary - Safety Analysis Set 
There were 11 subject deaths during perampanel exposure, 3 of which were previously reported in the 
previous interim synoptic CSR where the mean cumulative duration of perampanel exposure was 52 
weeks. Two of the 11 deaths were classified as a sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Ten 
of the 11 deaths occurred within 30 days of the last dose of perampanel (8 occurred while on 
perampanel or within 2 to 3 days of the last dose). One death occurred more than 30 days after the 
last dose of perampanel. Ten of the 11 deaths were assessed by the investigator as not related to 
study treatment; a death due to convulsions in an adolescent subject was assessed as possibly related 
to study treatment. In addition, there was a pregnancy in a subject which resulted in neonatal death 
after Caesarian delivery. 
A total of 288 (23.7%) subjects in the Safety Analysis Set had SAEs (including fatal events) up through 
the 5 years of exposure to perampanel across the DB or OLE studies. The most common treatment-
emergent SAEs (preferred terms) were those related to epilepsy (convulsion [n=43, 3.5%], status 
epilepticus [n=16, 1.3%], epilepsy [n=15, 1.2%], grand mal convulsion [n=6, <1%], seizure cluster 
EMA/CHMP/732770/2015   
Page 17/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
[n=6, <1%], partial seizures [n=3, <1%], partial seizures with secondary generalisation [n=3, <1%], 
drug withdrawal convulsions [n=2, <1%]). Most of these epilepsy-related TEAEs were considered 
serious because they involved hospitalisation or prolonged hospitalization. Pneumonia (n=13, 1.1%) 
and aggression (n=14, 1.2%) were the only non-seizure related SAEs reported in >1% of subjects. 
Those SAEs which occurred in 0.5% to <1.0% (6 to 12 subjects) were head injury (n=12), psychotic 
disorder (n=8), ankle fracture (n=7), suicidal ideation (n=6), urinary tract infection (n=6), and 
abortion induced (n=6). All non-fatal SAEs had resolved except in 12 subjects (1.0%) (peripheral 
sensorimotor neuropathy [24095001], epilepsy [13035002], colitis [25026006], head injury 
[52015004], iritis [25036001], somnolence [25026010], breast cancer metastatic [28065004], 
nephrolithiasis [29045003], ataxia [32026006], affective disorder [42045004], carotid artery 
dissection [34035004], pneumonia and dementia [51284011]). Non-fatal SAEs led to withdrawal of 
perampanel in 70 (5.0%) subjects. 
TEAEs resulting in discontinuation from the study or perampanel treatment occurred in 231 subjects 
(19 %) in the Safety Analysis Set up through the 5 years of exposure to perampanel in the DB or OLE 
study (Table 5). For 194 of these subjects, AEs were also the primary reason for withdrawal from the 
study (Table 1). For 39 of the 231 subjects, the investigator indicated that AEs was the secondary 
reason for study withdrawal (primary reason of subject choice in 25 subjects, inadequate therapeutic 
response in 11 subjects, lost to follow-up in 2 subjects, and administrative/other in 1 subject). For 3 
subjects who were discontinued from perampanel therapy due to an AE, the primary reason for 
withdrawal from the study was administrative/other (unable to receive oral drug [10074009], study 
closing [10074002 and 24035001]) (Listing 16.2.1.2). 
Dizziness (n=50, 4.1%) irritability (n=15, 1.2%), and fatigue (n=13, 1.1%) were the only TEAEs 
(preferred terms) that resulted in the discontinuation of 1% or more of subjects; other TEAEs 
(preferred terms) that resulted in the discontinuation of 0.5% to <1.0% (6 to 12) of subjects were 
mainly psychiatric or nervous system disorders (convulsion [n=12], aggression [n=12], somnolence 
[n=11], ataxia [n=10], abnormal behaviour [n=9], headache [n=8], anger [n=7], depression [n=6], 
suicidal ideation [n=6], and gait disturbance [n=6]) and also included vertigo (n=7), weight increased 
(n=8), and diplopia (n=6). 
A total of 531 (43.7%) of subjects in the Safety Analysis Set had a TEAE that resulted in interruption of 
study drug or dose adjustment (i.e., reduction) during exposure to perampanel in the DB or OLE study. 
The most common of these events (≥2.0% incidence) were dizziness (22.8%), somnolence (8.6%), 
ataxia (3.6%), fatigue (3.1%), dysarthria (2.3%), headache (2.3%), gait disturbance (2.1%), and 
vertigo (2.1%). For most subjects, these TEAEs resolved without sequelae and the subject remained 
on treatment. 
TEAEs that the investigators indicated were associated with overdose (by checking a box on the AE 
page of the CRF) occurred in 25 (2.1%) subjects in the Safety Analysis Set during exposure to 
perampanel in the DB or OLE study. The most common TEAEs that the investigators indicated were 
associated with overdose were in the nervous system disorder SOC (n=18, 1.5%), of which dizziness 
(n=13, 1.1%) was the most common. All but 1 of these TEAEs resolved (somnolence in 1 subject was 
persisting). For 6 subjects, these TEAEs were serious (mostly due to requiring hospitalisation) 
(intentional overdose, accidental overdose [n=2], suicide attempt, grand mal seizure, and adjustment 
disorder). 
There were a total of 14 pregnancies in 13 women enrolled in Study 307 (3 subjects had 2 
pregnancies, one approximately 6 months apart, one approximately 1 year apart, one subject 
approximately 18 months apart). Of the 14 pregnancies, 8 resulted in induced abortions (12036009, 
21026008, 21026020, 30036001, 51735003, 33014004, 39566001, and 10124004), 3 resulted in a 
EMA/CHMP/732770/2015   
Page 18/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
spontaneous abortion (30036001, 39566001, and 10124006), 2 resulted in the birth of a healthy 
infant (30026004 and 10124006). The remaining pregnancy (27606003) also resulted in a live birth 
following Caesarian section at 39 weeks of gestation; however, the neonate died approximately 5-6 
hours after birth. The investigator considered the neonatal death to be likely related to aspiration of 
fluid during birth and not related to study treatment. Perampanel was discontinued in 8 subjects (6 as 
a result of the positive pregnancy test, 2 for lack of efficacy), including 4 subjects who subsequently 
had an induced abortion, 2 subjects who subsequently had a spontaneous abortion, 1 subject who 
delivered a healthy infant, and the 1 subject whose pregnancy resulted in neonatal death after 
Caesarian delivery. Narratives for the 13 subjects with confirmed pregnancies are provided in Section 
14.3.3. Positive pregnancy test results were erroneously recorded on the CRF for 2 subjects 
(37016004, 51364005); the investigational sites confirmed that these subjects had not been pregnant. 
Sixteen (1.3%) subjects in the Safety Analysis Set had an AE related to suicidality during exposure to 
perampanel in the DB and/or OLE study. For 12 subjects, the event consisted of suicidal ideation, and 
for 4 subjects, the event was non-fatal suicide attempt. All subjects with suicidal events recovered, and 
8 of the 16 subjects remained in the study. 
Falls were reported as a TEAE for 118 (9.7%) of subjects during perampanel exposure during the DB 
or OLE study. Few of these events were serious (n=5) or resulted in withdrawal of perampanel 
treatment (n=5). 
Aggression events (aggression, anger, paranoia) were reported as TEAEs for 85 (7.0%) subjects during 
perampanel exposure during the DB or OLE study (Table 6). Most of these events were non-serious 
and did not result in treatment discontinuation. For 14 subjects (1.2%), aggression was serious, and 
for 12 subjects (<1%), this event resulted in withdrawal of perampanel treatment. Most events of 
aggression that were serious or resulted in discontinuation of study treatment resolved. 
Mood disorders and disturbances were the most common AE category of special interest, reported for 
263 (21.6%) subjects. The most common of these events was irritability (n=158, 13.0%). Irritability 
generally did not result in treatment discontinuation (n=1, <1%) and was considered serious in only 1 
subject. 
At least 1 TEAE occurred in 1130 (92.9%) subjects in the Safety Analysis Set during exposure to 
perampanel in the DB and/or OLE study. The following table presents common TEAEs, i.e., those with 
an incidence of ≥5.0%.

Population) - Safety Analysis Set and Adolescent Safety Analysis Set

The TEAE profile for adolescents receiving perampanel in the DB and/or OLE study was generally 
similar to that for the entire Safety Analysis Set. The following common TEAEs in the total Safety 
Analysis Set (≥5%) appeared to be reported at an approximately 2-fold higher frequency in adolescent 
subjects receiving perampanel compared to the total population: nasopharyngitis (24.2% vs. 11.7%), 
aggression (20.2% vs. 5.4%), vomiting (13.7% vs. 7.8%), and pyrexia (14.5% vs. 6.6%) (Table 
above). The following common TEAEs in the total Safety Analysis Set were at least 2-fold less frequent 
among adolescents receiving perampanel compared to the total population: back pain (2.4% vs 7.2%), 
vertigo (1.6% vs 6.4%), and dysarthria (1.6% vs 5.1%). Of note, irritability occurred in similar rates 
for the total and adolescent Safety Analysis Sets (13.2% and 12.9%, respectively). 
One death occurred in an adolescent subject (death due to convulsion in Subject 51815001). Rates for 
the following events in adolescents were similar to those for the total Safety Analysis Set: SAEs 
(29.0% vs 23.7%, respectively), AEs leading to discontinuation from the study or perampanel (18.5% 
vs 19.0%, respectively), and TEAEs leading to dose reduction (34.7% vs 41.6%, respectively). SAEs 
reported in 2% or more of adolescent subjects were convulsions (n=11, 8.9%), aggression (n=5, 
4.0%), and status epilepticus (n=3, 2.4%) was the most common SAE among adolescent subjects. 
There were no clinically important mean changes in haematology or clinical chemistry laboratory 
values during exposure to perampanel in the DB and/or OLE study for the Safety Analysis Set. 
Similarly, shift analysis revealed no shifts of clinical concern for haematology or clinical chemistry 
parameters. The most common markedly abnormal haematology value was low neutrophils (n=86, 
7.2%), while the most common markedly abnormal clinical chemistry value was low sodium (n=62, 
5.2%) and high gamma glutamyl transferase (n=71, 5.9%). The clinical laboratory safety profile for 
the 124 adolescent subjects was similar to that described for the overall Safety Analysis Set. 
There were no clinically important mean changes in vital signs during perampanel exposure in the DB 
and/or OLE study for the Safety Analysis Set; mean changes from baseline to the EOT in blood 
pressure and heart rate were less than ± 2 mmHg or bpm, respectively. The pattern of results for vital 
sign measurements during perampanel exposure for the Adolescent Safety Analysis Set was similar to 
that for the total Safety Analysis Set. As expected, there was a progressive increase in body weight 
and height over time for both male and female subjects. The mean ± SD change from baseline to the 
EOT in body weight and height were 7.63 ± 9.933 kg (n=72) and 5.71 ± 8.677 cm (n=49), 
respectively, among male adolescent subjects and 6.23 ± 7.995 kg (n=51) and 3.41 ± 3.536 cm 
(n=36), respectively, among female adolescent subjects. In this adolescent population, a weight 
increase of >7% was observed in 67.7% of adolescents (9.7% had weight decrease of >7%). 
There were no clinically important changes in mean ECG parameters. Shifts from baseline to each visit 
in ECG interpretation also showed no shifts of clinical concern. The ECG results for the Adolescent 
Safety Analysis Set were consistent with those for the total Safety Analysis Set. 
With implementation of Amendment 03, Tanner staging was to have been done and blood samples 
were to have been collected and analysed for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine 
(fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and IGF-1 at Week 16 and 40 among adolescent subjects. There was no 
appreciable difference in the mean or median values for TSH, fT3, fT4, and IGF-1 at Weeks 16 and 40. 
Tanner staging data were available for 13 adolescents (6 male, 7 female). All but 1 of these subjects 
were at Tanner Stage IV or V at OLE Baseline (one female subject was in Tanner Stage III), and either 
remained at the same stage or had increased to the next stage at the last available assessment. There 
were too few adolescent subjects to allow meaningful interpretation of these data.

CHMP’s comment: 
Despite the length of the study and the total number of recruited patients, the exposure was relatively 
modest - 889 patients exposed to one year and considerably fewer for longer periods. The mean dose 
10.15mg can be regarded as reflective of what average will be used in the clinical practice. 124 
subjects who comprised the adolescent safety analysis set had the cumulative duration of exposure of 
119.09 (+/-70.392) weeks, the mean dose was marginally higher than in adults 10.31.  
Total 1017 treatment emergent adverse events occurred during the study. Of those 288 were 
described as serious. There were 11 deaths and of those one was in an adolescent due to convulsions 
assessed as possibly related to the study medication. In an additional case a pregnancy resulted in 
neonatal death following Caesarean delivery birth. The investigator considered the neonatal death to 
be likely related to aspiration of fluid during birth and not related to the study treatment. The reported 
cases of death are not seen as additional safety concern. 
Drug treatment was interrupted in 531 subjects due to TEAE of which the most common was dizziness. 
In majority of cases the treatment was continued after the AE resolved. TEAEs associated with 
overdose occurred in 25 subjects. In one subject the overdose related AE, somnolence, remain 
persistent. None of these safety events is unexpected or substantially different to what is seen with the 
product in past. 
Of the 14 pregnancies during the study, 8 resulted in induced abortions, 3 resulted in a spontaneous 
abortion and 2 in birth to a healthy infant. In addition, as already mentioned, one infant died after 
birth by Caesarean section. There are no clear safety signals from cases of pregnancies in this trial. 
Aggression events (aggression, anger, paranoia) were reported as TEAEs for 85 (7.0%) subjects. For 
14 subjects (1.2%), aggression was serious, and for 12 subjects (<1%), this event resulted in 
withdrawal of perampanel treatment. 
Of the TEAEs Dizziness, Somnolence and Headache are the most frequently recorded events. 
Headache, however, does not appear in the list of AEs in the current product information. Following the 
request for the additional information, the justification for leaving it out based on the similarity of the 
rates in those on placebo and those on perampanel in the placebo controlled studies was accepted. 
Aggression appeared in 20.2% of the adolescent subjects compared to 5.4% in the overall study 
population. In addition the safety profile in the overall population does not appear entirely similar to 
that in the patients younger than 18.

The table above illustrates that there are certain differences in the safety profiles in overall study 
population compared to the adolescent subgroup. The differences are likely to be more pronounced if 
the adult subgroup rather than the overall population was compared to the adolescent subgroup. 
Originally proposed wording of the product information did not indicate that there was any difference in 
the safety profile of the product when used in the adults compared to the paediatric patients. 
Following the supplemental information on occurrence of aggression in adolescents, this was included 
in the product literature. The information on any other possible differences in the safety profile for 
adults and adolescents will be considered as part of the PSUR process. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
As part of this procedure the data from one study have been submitted. This was an open label 
extension in which patients from pivotal blinded randomised placebo controlled studies were enrolled 
and followed for loss of efficacy and for safety. 
There was no evidence of loss of efficacy, but due to the limitations in the design of the study, reliable 
conclusions about the efficacy in long term use cannot be made. 
Safety has also been assessed and the presented data generally match the known safety related issues 
for perampanel. However, further clarifications were requested in regards to the safety in the overall 
population compared to the safety in adolescents. The applicant has provided this information and the 
product literature has been amended to reflect the identified issues. 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The additional data submitted with this procedure is primarily focused on the longer term safety of the 
product. No reliable conclusions regarding the efficacy can be made based on the submitted data.  
Generally, the presented data confirm the known safety profile of perampanel and the risk benefit 
balance can also be regarded as positive. Following further clarification regarding the adverse event 
“aggression” in adolescents, the product information has been amended accordingly.  
A further, thorough comparison of the safety in adults and paediatric patients is needed. Since the 
product is already marketed, the post marketing information together with the trail data should be 
presented and analysed for any such differences during the next PSUR cycle.

4.  Additional clarification requested following preliminary 
assessment 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop. 
1.  Headache was recorded in 20.2% of subjects on this study. However, this does not appear in 
the section 4.8 of the SmPC. Please provide justification or amend the SmPC and PIL 
accordingly. 
2.  The safety profile as recorded in this study in the overall study population does not appear to 
closely match that of the adolescents. Further information is needed: 
a.  Please provide TEAE frequencies for adults (as opposed to the overall study population) 
and compare this to the TEAE frequencies in adolescents. 
b.  Please provide TEAE frequencies for the serious AEs in adults compared to the serious 
TEAE in paediatric patients. 
c.  Please integrate all safety results, the existing data and data recorded in E2007-G000-
307 and present the comparison of the integrated safety profile of adults to that of the 
paediatric patients. 
d.  Please provide evidence based justification of the SmPC statements that the safety 
profile in adolescents is expected to be similar to that of the adults, or alternatively 
amend the product information to reflect the differences. 
e.  Please justify the omission in SmPC and PIL of the information on increased rate of 
aggression in adolescent patients compared to adults or amend the product 
information accordingly. 
5.   Assessment of Applicants Responses 
Question 1 
Question 1 
Headache was recorded in 20.2% of subjects on this study. However, this does not appear in the 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. Please provide justification or amend the SmPC and PIL accordingly. 
Response 
The adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC were based on a review of the double blind Phase 3 
partial-onset seizure (POS) epilepsy studies (304, 305, and 306). In the POS submission which 
included the Epilepsy Phase 3 Double-blind pool, headache occurred in 11.3% of subjects on placebo 
and 11.4% of total subjects on perampanel. In the integrated data of controlled clinical studies of both 
POS and primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures (Studies 304, 305, 306, and 332), headache 
EMA/CHMP/732770/2015   
Page 24/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
occurred in 11.1% of subjects on placebo and 11.9% of subjects on perampanel. Headache was not 
considered an adverse reaction and was therefore not included in Section 4.8. Headache is a fairly 
common symptom across the patient population, as demonstrated by the placebo rate in the controlled 
clinical trials. The incidence rate of headaches would be expected to go up in longer duration studies, 
such as the open-label extension 307 study, as it happens for most adverse events (AEs), even in the 
absence of a drug effect. Therefore, it is considered that the incidence rate of 20.2% in Study 307 
after long-term open-label treatment does not change the conclusion of the analysis of the controlled 
clinical trial data that headache is not an adverse drug reaction for perampanel. 
Assessment of the Response and Conclusion 
The rates of headache compared to placebo are marginally higher than for those on active treatments 
in the placebo controlled studies. The applicant’s justification for not including headache is accepted. 
Point resolved. 
Question 2A 
Please provide TEAE frequencies for adults (as opposed to the overall study population) and compare 
this to the TEAE frequencies in adolescents. 
Response 
The incidence of the most common TEAEs for adults compared to those in paediatric patients are found 
in Table 1 below. The incidence of all TEAEs can be found in Appendix 1. Table 1 shows that the 
incidences of the majority of the TEAEs are comparable between adults and adolescents, although 
there is a higher incidence of aggression in adolescents (20.2%) compared to adults (3.8%). It is 
worth noting that higher incidence of aggression in adolescents was also observed in the phase 3 
double-bind, placebo-controlled studies. In addition, the incidence of nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, 
pharyngitis, abdominal pain and rhinitis is also higher (more than 2 times) in adolescents than in 
adults, although this is not unexpected in this age group.

Question 2B 
Please provide TEAE frequencies for the serious AEs in adults compared to the serious TEAE in 
paediatric patients. 
Response 
TEAE incidence for serious AEs in adults compared to serious TEAEs in adolescent patients for events in 
≥2 subjects in any population are found in Table 2 below. The incidence of all TEAEs can be found in 
Appendix 2. The result shows higher incidence of epilepsy related SAEs (convulsion and status 
epilepticus), as well as aggression in adolescents compared to adults.

Question 2C 
Please integrate all safety results, the existing data and data recorded in E2007-G000- 307 and 
present the comparison of the integrated safety profile of adults to that of the paediatric patients. 
Response 
The incidence of the most common TEAE for adults compared to those for paediatric patients in the 
pooled data from three open label extension (OLE) studies are found in Table 3 below. The incidence of 
all TEAEs can be found in Appendix 3. 
Table 3 shows that the incidence of the majority of the TEAEs is comparable between adults and 
adolescents, although there is a higher incidence of aggression in adolescents (12.5%) compared to 
adults (3.3%), while the incidence of dizziness, weight increased, nausea, back pain, depression, gait 
disturbance, vertigo, ataxia, and contusion is higher (more than 2 times) in adults than in adolescents. 
This observation based on the pooled data from three OLE studies is consistent with that in Study 307 
alone. It should be noted that a higher overall incidence is expected for most adverse events, due to 
the longer exposure in the OLE compared to double blind studies, however the qualitative profile 
remains similar between the five double blind studies (Table 4) compared to the OLE.

TEAE frequencies for the serious AEs in adults compared to the serious TEAE for adolescent patients in 
the pooled data from three OLE studies are found in Appendix 4. The result shows higher incidence of 
convulsion, as well as aggression in adolescents compared to adults. This observation based on the 
pooled data from three OLE studies is consistent with that in Study 307 alone. 
Question 2D 
Please provide evidence based justification of the SmPC statements that the safety profile in 
adolescents is expected to be similar to that of the adults, or alternatively amend the product 
information to reflect the differences. 
EMA/CHMP/732770/2015   
Page 31/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Response 
Based on the clinical trial database of 196 adolescents from double-blind studies (Studies 304, 305, 
306, 235, and 332) for partial onset seizures and PGTC seizures, as well as database of 257 
adolescents from long-term open-label extension studies (307, 235 extension, and 332 extension), the 
safety profile in adolescents is similar to that of the adults. Aggression, while common in both adults 
and adolescents, was observed more commonly in adolescents than in adults. 
Question 2E 
Please justify the omission in SmPC and PIL of the information on increased rate of aggression in 
adolescent patients compared to adults or amend the product information accordingly. 
Response 
The pivotal POS studies had demonstrated increased frequency of aggression in adolescents compared 
to adults but the sample size of adolescents compared to adults was small. We propose the following 
wording in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Paediatric population 
Based on the clinical trial database of 165 adolescents, the frequency, type and severity of adverse 
reactions in adolescents are expected to be the same as in adults. 
Based on the clinical trial database of 196 adolescents from double-blind studies for partial onset 
seizures and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the overall safety profile in adolescents was 
generally similar to that of the adults. Aggression, while common in both adults and adolescents, was 
observed more frequently in adolescents than in adults. 
Assessment of the Response and Conclusion 
The applicant has provided the requested information. The data shows that aggression, convulsion, 
status epilepticus, rhinitis, pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, pyrexia and abdominal pain appeared more 
frequently in the study.  
The applicant is changing the SmPC to include the warning regarding the higher incidence of 
aggression in adolescents. The other AEs reported higher in this study have occurred in relatively small 
number of trial participants and reliability of conclusions covering those in the context of the current 
variation would be limited. Considering that the post marketing data would be of particular interest 
here, the other differences in safety profiles of adolescents and adults should be revisited and 
addressed through the PSUR process. 
Point can be considered resolved. 
6.  Additional clarifications required by the CMSs 
The Rapporteur’s assessment and conclusions are supported. However we would like to propose a 
rewording of the Paediatric population statement in SmPC section 4.8.  
A rewording of the Paediatric population statement in SmPC section 4.8 was proposed by the MAH and 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. We would like to propose to amend the wording as indicated 
below (deletions crossed, additions underlined): 
EMA/CHMP/732770/2015   
Page 32/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
Based on the clinical trial database of 196 adolescents from double-blind studies for partial onset 
seizures and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the overall safety profile in adolescents 
was generally similar to that of the adults. Aggression, while common in both adults and adolescents, 
except for aggression, which was observed more frequently in adolescents than in adults. 
Response 
The applicant confirmed their agreement with the proposed wording with a minor addition as outlined 
below bold and underscored text: 
Paediatric population 
Based on the clinical trial database of 196 adolescents exposed to perampanel from double-blind 
studies for partial onset seizures and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the overall safety 
profile in adolescents was generally similar to that of the adults. Aggression, while common in both 
adults and adolescents, except for aggression, which was observed more frequently in adolescents 
than in adults. 
Assessment of the Response and Conclusion 
The proposed wording: 
Paediatric population 
Based on the clinical trial database of 196 adolescents exposed to perampanel from double-blind 
studies for partial onset seizures and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the overall safety 
profile in adolescents was similar to that of adults, except for aggression, which was observed more 
frequently in adolescents than in adults. 
Is in line with the data and requested changes and it is, therefore, acceptable. 
Point resolved.

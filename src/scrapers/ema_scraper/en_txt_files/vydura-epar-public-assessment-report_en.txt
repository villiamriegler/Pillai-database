2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Migraine  is  a  serious,  chronic,  disabling  neurological  disease  characterised  by  attacks  of  moderate  to 
severe  headache  pain  associated  with  other  symptoms  such  as  nausea,  vomiting,  photophobia,  and 
phonophobia. Migraine attacks typically last from 4 to 72 hours if untreated or unsuccessfully treated. 
People with migraine may experience an aura prior to the onset of their headache. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Migraine is a highly prevalent disease, occurring in 11% to 12% of people in Europe, with higher rates 
among women (16% to 18%) than men (6% to 7%) (Goadsby et al. 2002). The disease is particularly 
common among individuals between the ages of 25 and 55 years. Migraine has been reported to be the 
second highest cause of years lived with disability, interfering significantly with occupational, educational, 
household, family, and social responsibilities (GBD 2017). Because of intense pain and other burdensome 
symptoms including photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting (Linde and Dahlöf 2004; Ford et 
al. 2017), patients with migraine report extensive limitations in life activities (Leonardi et al. 2010). 
People with migraine have higher lifetime rates of comorbid depression, anxiety, panic disorder, sleep 
disturbances, chronic pain syndromes, and suicide attempts (Buse et al. 2009; MRF 2017). They are also 
at higher risk for ischaemic stroke and other cardiovascular (CV) diseases (Blumenfeld et al. 2011; Sacco 
and Kurth 2014). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
It is currently thought that migraine has a neurologic aetiology (Goadsby et al. 2002; Goadsby 2009; 
Amin  et  al.  2013).  The  brains  of  patients  with  migraine  are  characterised  by  a  generalised  neuronal 
hyperexcitability, evidenced by increased response to visual, sensory, auditory, and nociceptive stimuli, 
and migraine attacks involve release of neurotransmitters and activation of pain pathways, including the 
trigeminal nerve (Xavier et al. 2017; Dodick 2018). Migraine pain appears to involve nociceptive neurons 
in  the  dura  mater  being  stimulated  and  releasing  vasoactive  neuropeptides  such  as  calcitonin  gene-
related  peptide  (CGRP).  The  trigeminal  nerve  pathway  transmits  nociception  from  the  meninges  via 
intermediate pathways to the cortex.  
The CGRP is a neuropeptide that modulates nociceptive signalling and causes vasodilation that has been 
associated with migraine pathophysiology. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Standard  diagnostic  criteria  are  based  the  International  Classification  of  Headache  Disorders  (ICHD-3 
beta version). They have been developed by the Headache Classification Committee of the International 
Headache  Society  (IHS).  As  per  inclusion  criteria in  phase  2/3 trials,  the  target  population,  for  which 
treatment with rimegepant (RGP) is claimed, was defined along historical numbers of migraine attacks, 
resp. migraine days (MDs). While prevention study 305 was ongoing, amendments to the protocol were 
implemented  widening  inclusion  criteria  as  to  also  include  subjects  with  up  to  18  headache  days  per 
month. Thereby, subjects with CM would potentially be eligible for study participation. Definite ICHD-3 
Codes like e.g. 1.1 Migraine without aura, 1.2.1 Migraine with typical aura, 1.3 Chronic migraine, or 8.2 
Medication-overuse headache (MoH) were not provided at the entry of pivotal RGP studies. 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 10/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
According  to  diagnostic  categories,  migraine  without  aura  (1.1)  is  described  as  recurrent  headache 
disorder  manifesting  in  attacks  lasting  4-72  hours.  Typical  characteristics  of  the  HA  are  unilateral 
location,  pulsating  quality,  moderate  or  severe  intensity,  aggravation  by  routine  physical  activity  and 
association with nausea and/or photophobia and phonophobia. For a firm diagnosis to be established, 
the patient has to present with at least five attacks, that fulfil a list of respective criteria. As opposed to 
EM, CM (Code 1.3) requires headache to occur on 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months, 
which has the features of migraine headache on at least 8 days per month. 
2.1.5.  Management 
According to current treatment guidelines, unspecific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) 
like  acetylic  acid,  ibuprofen,  paracetamol  etc.  rank  among  first-line  therapies,  however,  are  typically 
used  for  less  severe  migraine  attacks.  The  portion  of  patients  being  pain-free  2  hours  post-dose  is 
established  as  the  most  meaningful  measure  for  efficacy  of  current  migraine  therapies.  The  rates  of 
patients  2-hours  pain-free  that  can  be  achieved  with  unspecific  NSAIDS  in  meta-analyses  are  in  the 
range of 20-25% (Ferrari et al. 2002; Cameron et al. 2015). 
Major progress in more specific treatment of acute migraine symptoms was achieved with the advent of 
the triptans in the nineties. Triptans target 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors and their mechanism is thought 
to involve cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release (Rizatriptan 
Summary of product characteristics (SmPC)). As the gold standard for acute treatment of migraine, they 
represent 28% to 36% of prescribed acute migraine medications (Mafi et al. 2015; Molina et al. 2018). 
However, triptans are not efficacious for all patients: rates of pain freedom at 2 hours post-dose with 
triptans in a meta-analysis are in the range of 20% to 40% (Ferrari et al. 2002). Furthermore, efficacy 
and tolerability vary, both between agents (7 triptans approved so far), and from patient to patient, with 
about 30-40% of patients not responding adequately to triptan therapy (Viana M et al. 2013). 
Not all patients with migraine tolerate triptans. Among those discontinuing triptan therapy, side effects 
were reported as the reason in 29% of patients (Wells et al. 2014). Also, triptans are contraindicated in 
patients  with  coronary  artery  disease  (CAD),  peripheral  vascular  disease,  cerebrovascular  disease,  or 
uncontrolled  hypertension  (Dodick  et  al.  2004;  RELPAX  SmPC).  A  large  proportion  of  patients  with 
migraine have CV risk  factors, a history of CV events, conditions, or procedures, or a high risk of CV 
disease (Lipton et al. 2017). 
Acute treatment of migraine attacks is to be differentiated from prophylactic treatment of migraine, for 
which most recently several human / humanised antibodies, selectively binding to the CGRP ligand or its 
receptor, have been approved (erenumab [Aimovig], fremanezumab [Ajovy], galcanezumab [Emgality], 
eptinezumab [Vyepti, US]. 
Although forming the mainstay of current acute migraine therapy, it is concluded that around 30% of 
patients  fail  to  respond  to  a  particular  triptan  (Dodick  DW  2005).  The  reasons  therefore  are  not  fully 
understood. On top of considerable inter- and intra-individual attack variability, a large number of other 
factors  modifying  responsiveness  have  been  identified,  like  e.g.  concomitant  use  of  preventive 
medication,  MoH,  inadequate  dosing,  the  time  point  of  medication  intake  relative  to  the  onset  of  the 
attack, incomplete absorption due to concomitant gastric stasis or vomiting, presence resp. absence of 
aura symptoms etc. (Viana M 2013). Furthermore, the use of the triptans is limited with regard to their 
CV  risk  profile.  As  evidenced  for  the  leading  substance  (sumatriptan),  triptans  are  contraindicated  in 
patients  with  a  previous  cerebrovascular  accident  (CVA),  transient  ischemic  attack  (TIA),  moderately 
severe or severe hypertension, or untreated mild hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, established 
CAD, including ischemic heart disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented 
silent ischemia) or Prinzmetal’s angina.

Overall,  in  view  of  incomplete  response  to  currently  available  acute  migraine medications  on  the  one 
side and limitations to their use due to CV safety concerns on the other side, there is a general need for 
new therapeutic approaches in acute migraine therapy. Based on its pharmacological profile as an orally-
administered CGRP receptor antagonist and the assumed favourable CV risk profile, RGP may potentially 
constitute a valuable contribution to the currently available therapeutic armamentarium. 
2.2.  About the product 
Rimegepant  (BHV-3000;  formerly  BMS-927711)  is  presented  as  a  selective,  high-affinity,  orally 
administered, small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist.  
Calcitonin gene-related peptide is an endogenous 37 amino acid peptide contained within pain-signalling 
nociceptive afferents, and is thought to play a causal role in migraine (Edvinsson 2018, Moreno-Ajona 
2020). Multiple lines of clinical evidence point to a role for CGRP in migraine pathophysiology: 1) serum 
levels of CGRP are elevated during migraine; 2) treatment with anti-migraine drugs returns CGRP levels 
to  normal  coincident  with  pain  relief;  and  3)  intravenous  (IV)  CGRP  infusion  produces  lasting  pain  in 
non-migraineurs and migraineurs. 
Treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist is thought to relieve migraine by: 1) blocking CGRP-induced 
neurogenic  vasodilation  (returning  dilated  intracranial  arteries  to  normal);  2)  halting  the  cascade  of 
CGRP-induced neurogenic inflammation (which leads to peripheral and central sensitisation); and/or 3) 
inhibiting  the  central  relay  of  pain  signals  from  the trigeminal  nerve  to  the  caudal  trigeminal  nucleus 
(Durham 2004). 
The indication proposed for Vydura does not align with standard wordings approved for the treatment of 
migraine  so  far.  Rimegepant  is  the  first  substance  to  claim  efficacy  both  for  acute  and  prophylactic 
treatment of migraine. Available, orally administered preventive migraine medications (topiramate, ß-
blockers)  are  not  effective  in  acute  migraine  and  their  mode  of  action  in  migraine  prevention  is 
hypothetical.  
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
This is a complete and independent application.  
2.4.  Quality aspects

2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The  chemical  name  of  the  active  substance  is  (5S,6S,9R)-5-amino-6-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-6,7,8,9 
tetrahydro-5H-cyclohepta[b]pyridin-9-yl

piperidine-1-carboxylate  hemisulfate  sesquihydrate  corresponding 
to 
the  molecular 
formula 
C28H28F2N6O3 • 0.5 H2O • 1.5 H2O. It has a molecular weight of 610.63 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active Substance Structure 
The chemical structure of rimegepant was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy and UV-Visible absorption The solid 
state  properties  of  the  active  substance  were  measured  by  thermal  gravimetric  analysis  (TGA), 
differential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC),  gravimetric  vapor  sorption,  optical  microscopy  (for  particle 
morphology) and single crystal X-ray analysis. 
The active substance is a white to off-white, slightly hygroscopicity powder, freely soluble in DMSO and 
DMF,  slightly  soluble in  MeOH  and  water,  very  slightly  soluble  in  organic  solvents  (EtOH,  acetone,  n-
BuOH, THF, acetonitrile) and practically insoluble in ethyl acetate. Its solubility decreases with increasing 
pH. It has three pKa values at 2.1, 6.5, 9.8.  
Rimegepant is a BCS Class 2 substance. It has low aqueous solubility, however excellent permeability 
provides for consistent and acceptably high oral bioavailability for the formulation. 
Rimegepant  exhibits  stereoisomerism  due  to  the  presence  of  three  chiral  centres.  An  acceptable 
justification for absence of controls on diastereomers is provided. 
Control of polymorphic form is included in the active substance specification. No change to polymorphic 
form  has  been  observed  at  either  long  term  or  accelerated  active  substance  storage  conditions.  No 
change to polymorphic form has been observed during manufacture or storage of the finished product 
either. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Two  manufacturers  are  involved  in  the  manufacture  of  the  active  substance.  Synthesis  of  the  active 
substance was adequately described. 
The  synthetic  steps  carried  out  at  each  site  are  described  in  detail,  indicating  either  ratio  or  weight/ 
volume equivalents for amounts, and tolerance ranges for reaction time and temperature. Low and high 
proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for process operations together with target set points have been added. 
For  justification of  the  three  starting  materials,  contribution  as  significant  structural  fragments  to  the 
molecular structure of the active substance is claimed, the number of steps to the final active substance, 
and control/stability as per specifications. The rationale for choice of the starting materials was accepted 
for  regulatory  starting  material  1.  A  major  objection  raised  on  starting  material  has  been  solved  by 
removing the supplier who used a synthetic route with inherent risk of presence of nitrosamines and/or 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 13/135

genotoxic compounds. The risk of presence of nitrosamines or genotoxic compounds has acceptably been 
ruled  out  for  the  actual  routes  of  synthesis.  As  further  requested  by  the  major  objection,  custom-
synthesised, previous starting material 3 used for synthesis of key intermediate II has been re-defined. 
Reaction is now under GMP control. Binding synthetic are described and suppliers indicated. Acceptable 
specifications and analytical procedures are provided. 
All  major objections have been  solved.  Details of  the  analytical  methodology have  been  disclosed,  as 
well as sufficient analytical proof that the risk of presence of nitrosamine impurities is negligible. At the 
time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  was  a  minor  unresolved  quality  issue  having  no  impact  on  the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant is reminded that the full active substance manufacturing 
process has to be validated in line with GMP requirements and this point is put forward and agreed as 
quality recommendation. 
Regarding  the  different  manufacturing  sites,  the  synthetic  processes  differ  slightly  with  respect  to 
amounts of reagents in terms of ratio and vol/wt equivalents and reaction conditions, as well as the IPC 
performed  at  the  individual  steps.  Comparative  analytical  results  and  impurity  profiles  of  the  key 
intermediates  confirm  that  the  slightly  different  processes  carried  out  at  the  proposed  manufacturing 
sites lead to equivalent quality of the key intermediates and final active substance, respectively, in terms 
of purity and content. Key intermediate specifications have been provided.  
Process validation data of commercial scale batches have been made available, according to updated in-
process controls, key intermediate specifications and the updated active substance specification. 
An  overview  on  manufacturing  process  history  and  summary  of  process  changes  is  provided.  The 
synthetic route remained basically unchanged throughout development, only minor changes were made. 
Changes  introduced  have  been  presented  in  sufficient  detail  and  have  been  justified.  During  process 
development studies carried out at each site, all operational process parameters were evaluated by an 
initial risk assessment to identify those which have a negative impact on the critical quality attributes of 
the active substance. Standard set points were chosen for pre-selected operational parameters based 
on process experience. Then PAR experiments and one variable at a time OVAT studies were conducted 
to confirm the operational parameter ranges for their impact on yield and purity. Based on the results 
obtained, all previous medium risk parameters were reduced to low risk category. Justification of the 
control strategy for operational process parameters valid for the commercial synthetic process at each 
site has been provided The PARs and normal operating ranges (NORs) have been set based on process 
knowledge and development, which is acceptable. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual), identification (IR, UPLC), assay 
(UPLC), related substances (UPLC), water content (KF), crystalline form (Ph. Eur.), melting point (Ph. 
Eur.),  residue  on  ignition  (Ph.  Eur.),  sulfate  content  (IC),  particle  size  analysis  (Ph.  Eur.),  residual 
solvents (GC), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.) and specified microorganisms (E. coli) (Ph. Eur.). 
Elemental  impurities  were  consistently  shown  to  be  below  the  30%  threshold  in  the  final  active 
substance,  therefore  no  routine  control  is  required.  Residual  solvents  are  controlled  according  to  ICH 
Q3C (R6), which has been demonstrated by results on process validation of commercial batches.

The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  data  generated  by  both  manufacturers  are  provided,  respectively,  including  early 
toxicology  batches  and  process  validation  batches.  The  results  and  impurity  profiles  are  comparable, 
complying with specifications. The results consistent from batch to batch. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability  data  from  three  primary  pilot  scale  batches  of  active  substance  from  each  of  the  proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions 
(25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. Additional supportive data was provided (on batches used to support 
clinical studies and process validation batches). 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, related substances, water content, solid state 
form and microbiological limits. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications with little or no variability or trending in any of the 
attributes measured at either condition. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch and demonstrate that 
the active substance is not sensitive to light. 
Results  on  stress  conditions:  acid,  base,  oxidation,  high  intensity  light,  and  heat  stress  were  also 
provided on one batch. Forced degradation studies were performed on solid state material (powder) and 
solutions prepared from the active substance. The active substance showed degradation when exposed 
to acidic, basic and oxidative conditions. The solid form showed little, or no degradation, when exposed 
to stress conditions including the photolytic light condition. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  suppliers  is 
sufficiently stable. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  oral  lyophilisate  containing  75  mg  of  rimegepant.  The  product 
contains the sulfate salt. The oral lyophilisate is designed to rapidly disintegrate in the mouth and does 
not require a reconstitution diluent. The product is presented as a white to off-white, circular lyophilisate 
with a diameter of 14 mm and debossed with the symbol 
. 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product followed QbD principles. 
The objective of the development was to provide a stable, oral lyophilisate presentation of rimegepant 
sulfate of consistent quality, containing 75 mg of rimegepant free base. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards  (except  for  mint  flavour).  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC a. Compatibility of excipients 
and the active substance has been verified in stability studies. 
Three oral formulations of rimegepant were used during the course of the development programme. A 
capsule  (free  base)  was  developed  and  used  in  early  development.  Two  formulations  of  rimegepant 
sulfate (hemisulfate sesquihydrate salt), an oral lyophilisate formulation and a tablet formulation, were 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 15/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
then developed for use in pivotal clinical studies. A bioequivalence study was carried out between the 
tablet and oral lyophilisate formulations. The tablet and oral lyophilisate formulations were shown to be 
bioequivalent and the decision on what formulation to proceed with was based on patient convenience. 
Due  to  its  easier  administration  it  was  decided  to  continue  development  with  the  oral  lyophilisate 
formulation for commercialisation. 
The finished product was developed using Catalent's Zydis technology. The finished product is a rapidly 
disintegrating oral lyophilisate designed to disperse instantly in the mouth. The manufacturing process 
development is presented in satisfactory detail and provides information on studies carried out during 
pilot scale and scale-up campaign. 
A  major  objection  on  the  absence  of  an  appropriate  dissolution  method  was  raised.  In  response,  a 
dissolution method in accordance with Ph. Eur. 2.9.3. was proposed. The discriminatory power of the 
dissolution method has been. By providing this data the major objection was resolved. 
The  primary  packaging  is  blisters  made  of  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC),  oriented  polyamide  (OPA)  and 
aluminium  foil  and  sealed  with  a  peelable  aluminium  foil.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: mixing/dosing, freezing, freeze-drying, and heat 
seal/packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process of the finished product includes three critical processing steps. These critical 
steps  have  been  monitored  during  development  and  manufacture  of  registration  batches  through  in-
process  testing  and  were  also  monitored  during  the  process  validation;  they  will  additionally  be 
monitored during commercial manufacturing.  
The  manufacturing process  has  been  validated  on  consecutive  commercial  scale  batches.  It  has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance  (visual),  identification  (UPLC,  UV),  assay  (UPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (UPLC), 
disintegration (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), related substances (UPLC), dissolution (HPLC), crystalline 
form  (XRPD),  microbiological  purity  (Ph.  Eur.),  and  absence  of  specified  micro-organisms  (E.  coli,  P. 
aeruginosa, S. aureus) (Ph. Eur.). 
The disintegration criteria is determined to ensure that the product disintegrates promptly. The limit is 
consistent  with  FDA  guidance  on  Orally  Disintegrating  Tablets,  2008,  as  well  as  the  3  minutes  limit 
specified in the Ph. Eur. Monograph for oral lyophilisates. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on three 
pilot  scale  batches using a  validated  ICP-MS  method  was  provided,  demonstrating  that  each  relevant 
elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
and  the  presented  batch  data  it  can  be  concluded  that  it  is  not  necessary  to  include  any  elemental 
impurity controls. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.

A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has  been  performed  considering  all  suspected  and  actual  root  causes  in  line  with  the  “Questions  and 
answers  for  marketing  authorisation  holders/applicants  on  the  CHMP  Opinion  for  the  Article  5(3)  of 
Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004-  Nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/369136/2020).  Based  on  the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance 
or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided,  confirming  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on release specifications, through traditional final 
product release testing. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  four  primary  pilot  scale  batches  of  finished  product,  manufactured  with  active 
substance from both sources, stored for up to 36 months (38 months for one batch) under long term 
conditions  (25ºC  /  60%  RH),  for  up  to  36  months  (38  months  for  one  batch)  under  intermediate 
conditions  (30ºC  /  75%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40ºC  /  75%  RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Vydura are identical to those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in a primary packaging representative of the one proposed for marketing. 
Further supportive data is provided: at room temperature and 6 months of data at accelerated storage 
conditions are available for process validation batches at commercial batch size (manufactured with both 
active substance sources). All the validation batches are scheduled for stability testing as per the stability 
protocol. 
Samples were tested for appearance, water content, assay, related substances and crystalline form. The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
A photostability study according to the ICH guideline Q1B is not considered necessary as the proposed 
multi-layered primary packaging has been verified by CHMP and is found to be light-proof. Moreover, 
the active substance itself is photostable. 
Based on available stability data, a shelf-life of 36 months with the storage precautions “Do not store 
above  30°C;  Store  in  the  original  package  in  order  to  protect  from  moisture”  as  stated  in  the  SmPC 
(section 6.3) are acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from fish is used in the product. No other excipients derived from animal or human 
origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Vydura  is  presented  as  an  oral  lyophilisate,  a  freeze-dried  orally  administered  formulation.  The  oral 
lyophilisate is designed to rapidly disintegrate in the mouth and does not require a reconstitution diluent. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 17/135

uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  clinical  use.  Major  objections  on 
designation of regulatory starting materials and absence of a dissolution method and demonstration of 
its discriminatory ability have been successfully resolved by providing requested data. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertains to completion of the validation of the active substance 
manufacturing process in line with GMP requirements, following the redefinition of the RSM during the 
MAA evaluation. This point is put forward and agreed as recommendation. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
Validation  data  for  the  active  substance  synthesis,  using  the  re-defined  starting  material  should  be 
provided before commercialisation. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical testing strategy was developed consistently with the proposed clinical use of rimegepant, 
the proposed oral route of administration. The non-clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) /pharmacodynamic (PD) 
profile of remigepant was evaluated based on studies conducted by the applicant. The non-clinical safety 
profile of remigepant is described based on a series of non-clinical safety pharmacology and toxicology 
studies, repeat-dose toxicity studies and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Rimegepant is a high affinity (Ki = 32.9 pM) oral small molecule antagonist at the human CGRP receptor 
that is being developed for the treatment of migraine. CGRP is an endogenous 37 amino acid peptide 
contained within pain signaling nociceptive afferents, and is thought to play a causal role in migraine. 
Rimegepant is a CGRP receptor antagonist at the hCGRP receptor with high affinity binding (Ki = 32.9 
pM)  and  functional  (Kb  =  117.8  pM)  activity  at  the  hCGRP  receptor.  Rimegepant  shows  rapid  onset 
kinetics and delayed off-rate for binding to the hCGRP receptor, with a 5x tendency to remain bound 
versus unbound.  
Regarding receptor selectivity, rimegepant demonstrates 65- to > 300,000-fold selectivity for the hCGRP 
receptor over other members of the calcitonin receptor family; binding affinity for amylin 1 was the most 
similar, with an IC50 of 2.28 nM (compared to 54.3 pM for CGRP). Available data indicate that rimegepant 
does not have a consequential effect in diabetic patients. 
Rimegepant did not significantly alter ligand binding or functional activity against 30 of the 32 unique 
pharmacological  targets  at  maximum  concentrations  between  10  and  150  µM,  depending  on  the 
individual assay. Median Inhibition Concentration (IC50) or Half maximal effective concentration  (EC50) 
values  were  ≥10  µM,  except  for  PDE4  (EC50  of  5.8  µM)  and  the  norepinephrine  transporter  (NET) 
showing an IC50 of 9.5 uM. As rimegepant does not cross the blood brain barrier, significant interaction

EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
with  the  NET  transporter  is  not  anticipated.  Comparing  activity  across  species,  rimegepant  exhibits 
similar receptor affinities at both human (Ki of 33 pM) and nonhuman primate (marmoset (92 pM) and 
cynomolgus monkey (60 pM)) CGRP receptors, with more than 1,300-fold less activity at dog (43 nM), 
rat (209 nM) and mouse (104 nM) CGRP receptors as compared to human.  
Rimegepant does not contract human coronary arteries or intracranial arteries even when ex vivo tissues 
were exposed to high 3-10 μM concentrations. 
Rimegepant  shows  durable  efficacy  in  the  marmoset  facial  blood  flow  assay  against  a  strong  CGRP 
stimulus (designed to mimic CGRP release during severe migraine). Rimegepant effectively antagonised 
the hCGRP-induced increases in marmoset facial blood flow showing 75% to 80% inhibition at plasma 
levels of ~700 nM (or 374 ng/mL). 
In studies assessing a core battery of safety pharmacology endpoints, rimegepant demonstrated minimal 
or no adverse effects on central nervous system (CNS) or respiratory parameters (Sprague-Dawley rat 
and cynomolgus monkey at oral doses up to 100 and 60 mg/kg, respectively) or on CV parameters in 
vitro (rabbit Purkinje, hERG [IC50 >30 μM] and SCN5A currents in HEK-293 cells) or in vivo (cynomolgus 
monkey, at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg). 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Various in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to characterise the PK and metabolism of rimegepant 
in the non-clinical setting. Further data on toxicokinetics (TK) were obtained within the different studies 
conducted to investigate the toxicology of rimegepant. 
Single dose PK studies were performed in male rats, dogs and monkeys. Absolute oral bioavailability of 
rimegepant given as a solution in rats and monkeys was 45% and 67% respectively. When rimegepant 
was dosed as a suspension in monkeys, bioavailability was 48%. After oral administration, time to peak 
plasma concentrations (tmax) was 1.7 to 3.3 hours in rats and monkeys, respectively. Rimegepant has a 
significant pH-effect in dogs and oral dosing of the hemisulfate salt reduces the impact of higher gastric 
pH. Accordingly, all clinical phase III studies were conducted with the hemisulfate formulation.  
Rimegepant does not readily distribute into red blood cells, is moderately bound to plasma proteins and 
is highly distributed into tissues. Brain distribution was studied as a part of a 2-week exploratory study 
in male and female rats. Brain-to-plasma concentration ratio 24 hours after the last dose was 0.02 to 
0.08 in all groups, except for low dose males. The same brain exposure was observed, but 50% lower 
plasma exposure resulting in brain-to-plasma ratios below 0.19.  
In humans and different animal species investigated, unchanged rimegepant was the most prominent 
circulating component in plasma. Rimegepant was metabolised to a wide variety of different metabolites. 
No major metabolite (>10%) was detected in human plasma as well as in plasma of animal species. All 
metabolites detected in humans were also observed in at least one animal species. Based on data from 
animals and humans, rimegepant undergoes multiple pathways of metabolism: carbamoylation followed 
by glucuronidation, hydrolysis and oxidative metabolism. 
Faecal excretion was the major elimination pathway for [14C]-rimegepant in humans and animals (mice, 
rats, monkeys).  
Whether rimegepant transfers into breast milk was not investigated in animal studies. However, a clinical 
study was performed to evaluate rimegepant concentrations in plasma and breast-milk of breast-feeding 
women. 
When  assessed  in  vitro,  the  metabolism  of  rimegepant  was  primarily  mediated  via  CYP3A4  and  to  a 
lesser  extent  by  CYP2C9.  No  turnover  was  detected  with  the  CYP2C9  variant  forms,  CYP2C9*2  and 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 19/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
CYP2C9*3.  A  time-dependent  inhibition  was  observed  for  CYP3A4  in  recombinant  CYP  expression 
systems as well as in liver microsomes which lowered the exposure margin to the therapeutic maximum 
concentration (Cmax of rimegepant to 3.5-times. However, rimegepant was not likely an CYP3A4 inducer. 
Other CYP enzymes or Phase II enzymes do not seem to play a major role in rimegepant metabolism. 
Interactions of rimegepant with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors were also investigated clinically and are 
labelled in section 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Rimegepant is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BRCP) efflux 
transporters  in  vitro.  Transporter  interactions  of  rimegepant  with  P-gp  inhibitors  were  observed  in  a 
clinical drug interaction study assessing the effect of both P-gp and BCRP inhibition. However, no clinically 
significant interaction due to BCRP inhibition was observed. Respective statements are given in sections 
4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Rimegepant is not a substrate of OATP1B1 (Organic Anion Transport Protein 1b1) or OATP1B3 (Organic 
Anion Transport Protein 1b3). Considering its low renal clearance, it was not evaluated as a substrate of 
the  OAT1  (Organic  anion  transporter  1),  OAT3  (Organic  anion  transporter  3),  OCT2  (Organic  Cation 
Transporter  2),  MATE1  (multidrug  and  toxin  extrusion  protein  1),  or  MATE2-K  (multidrug  and  toxin 
extrusion  protein  2-K).  Rimegepant  is  not  an  inhibitor  of  P-gp,  BCRP,  OAT1,  or  MATE2-K  at  clinically 
relevant concentrations. It is a weak inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3. Rimegepant inhibited OCT2, MATE1 
and OATP1B3. IC50 values of OCT2 and MATE1 are near the therapeutic Cmax level of rimegepant (1.4 
µM). Considering 91-96 % of plasma protein binding, the free Cmax value results in an exposure margin 
below the in vitro IC50s.Concomitant administration of rimegepant with the MATE1 transporter substrate 
metformin  showed  no  clinically  significant  impact  on  metformin  PK  or  on  glucose  utilisation  which  is 
accordingly labelled in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
A full nonclinical toxicology testing was performed in mice (carcinogenicity), rats (single- and repeat-
dose  toxicity,  in  vivo  genotoxicity,  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity,  carcinogenicity),  rabbits 
(reproductive and developmental toxicity) and monkeys (single- and repeat-dose toxicity). Phototoxicity 
testing was performed in vitro and qualification of the impurity profile of rimegepant was investigated in 
a  3-month  chronic  toxicity  study  in  rats.  The  impurity  profiles  of  the  batches  used  in  the non-clinical 
studies tested was comparable to that used in clinic. 
No stand-alone local tolerance studies were performed with rimegepant because the intended therapeutic 
route (oral) was assessed in the repeat-dose general toxicity studies. Pivotal studies were conducted in 
compliance with GLP regulations and according to the ICH guidelines. All studies used rimegepant as the 
free base with the exception of the 6- and 9-repeat toxicity studies (rat, monkey), Segment I and III 
reproductive/developmental (rat), juvenile toxicity (rat), and carcinogenicity studies (mouse, rat) that 
used rimegepant sulfate, which is the form of this compound for human use. All studies used the oral 
application,  the  intended  clinical  route  of  administration  of  rimegepant.  TK  data  for  rimegepant  was 
determined in all studies. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in rats and monkeys. 
In the two week exploratory studies, rimegepant exposures of males and females were similar. However, 
in longer term studies (3 month and 6 month) exposures in females were around 2-times higher than in 
males. No accumulation of rimegepant was observed as well as a dose-proportional increase in Cmax and 
AUC in all rat studies. 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 20/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
Safety margins in rats at No-observed-effect level (NOEL) / No-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) 
to the exposure at the clinical dose (based on AUC) were obtained at ≥ 20 x for males and ≥ 27 x for 
females. 
The toxicity of rimegepant in monkeys was limited to dose dependent sporadical emesis (≥ 50 mg/kg) 
and transient, partly intermittent body weight loss and food consumption (≥ 50 mg/kg). Emesis was also 
a  finding  observed  in  clinical  trials.  Increased  liver weight  (≥  50  mg/kg)  and  histopathologic  findings 
(Kupffer cell hypertrophy with accumulated intracellular material, phagocytised cytoplasmic organelles, 
≥  200  mg/kg)  were  transient,  reversible  and  likely  physiological  adaptive  responses  related  to  the 
metabolism of the test article. Reversible minimal to mild intravascular hemolysis and reversible minimal 
to slight changes in clinical chemistry parameters showed no microscopic changes, were generally of low 
magnitude or had no dose relationship.  
No drug-induced liver injury or hemolysis were observed in clinical studies. 
In general, TK data is comparable between all pivotal monkey studies with respect to dose and systemic 
exposures. Safety margins to exposures (based on AUC) at the the clinical dose were obtained at ≥ 16 
x for males and ≥ 24 x for females. 
Rimegepant-related  effects  at  higher  doses  in  repeat-dose  studies  (hepatic  lipidosis  in  mice  and  rats, 
intravascular hemolysis in rats and monkeys, and emesis in monkeys) were observed only at exposures 
considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical 
use  (≥ 12  times  [mice]  and  ≥ 49  times  [rats]  for  hepatic  lipidosis,  ≥ 95  times  [rats]  and  ≥ 9  times 
[monkeys] for intravascular hemolysis, and ≥ 37 times for emesis [monkeys]) as represented in section 
5.3 of the SmPC.  
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity testing of rimegepant was carried out in two in vitro (bacterial and mammalian mutation 
assay, chromosome aberration assay) and an in vivo (rat micronucleus tests) study in compliance with 
GLP. Rimegepant was negative in in vitro Ames tests, chromosome aberration assays in CHO cells and 
in an oral in vivo micronucleus test performed in the rat. 
Carcinogenicity 
Rimegepant  was  not  carcinogenic  in  a  short-term  study  in  hemizygous  Tg.rasH2  mice  and  a  2  year 
lifespan study in Crl:CD(SD) rats. Despite the even lower binding affinity (Ki)  for the CGRP receptors 
compared to humans (≥ 1300 x) the exposures (Cmax unbound) in rodents exceeded the Ki 269 x in mice 
(Ki  0.104  µM)  respectively  14  x  in  rats  (Ki  0.209  µM)  at  the  NOAEL  (300  and  45  mg/kg)  for 
carcinogenicity. Therefore, both the on-target and off-target effects of rimegepant were appropriately 
evaluated in the carcinogenicity studies. The calculated safety margins based on AUC compared to the 
clinical exposure (75 mg/d) were 379x in mice and 45x in rats. Additionally, the applicant submitted a 
comprehensive weight of evidence risk assessment for carcinogenicity of rimegepant based on literature 
and study data. Rimegepant has generally minimal off-target binding, was negative for genetic toxicity, 
showed  no  proliferative  (hypertrophic/hyperplastic)  or  preneoplastic/neoplastic  changes  or  persistent 
tissue  injury  or  chronic  inflammation  in  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  up  to  the  highest  doses  tested 
independent of species and study duration. Further, no hormonal perturbation, histopathological changes 
in  endocrine  or  reproductive  organs  or  effects  on  the  immune  system  were  observed  in  pivotal  non-
clinical studies. 
Therefore, it can be assumed that rimegepant has no carcinogenic potential under the conditions of the 
studies. 
Reproductive and juvenile toxicity

In line with the proposed indication for comprehensive management of migraine in adults a full range of 
reproductive toxicity studies at different laboratory sites were conducted. Overall, the parameters studied 
meet the requirements of ICHS5 and compliance with GLP regulations was confirmed for all studies.  
The species used for the reproductive toxicity studies were considered adequate to evaluate both on-
target and off-target reproductive/developmental effects of rimegepant, as pharmacological activity at 
inhibiting CGRP binding to both rabbit and rat CGRP receptors was demonstrated.  
Two fertility and early embryonic development (FEED) studies were submitted. As pregnancy rate was 
significantly decreased following treatment of male and female rats with rimegepant at 150 mg/kg/d, a 
subsequent study with comparable design but much lower doses up to 25 mg/kg/d was conducted. This 
study showed no impact on pregnancy rate.  
In the first study, uterine atrophy was diagnosed for almost all non-pregnant high dose females at 150 
mg/kg/d  as  well  as  in  single  non-pregnant  rats  in  the  second  study,  respectively.  However,  external 
experts (Pathological Working Group / PWG) did not confirm this finding later. Instead, these experts 
identified deficiencies in the histopathologic evaluation resulting in significant artefacts microscopically. 
Furthermore, in the second study, uterine weights of several animals in each group were excluded due 
to wrong handling of gravid uteri prior to weighing. Nevertheless, when considering the results of both 
studies, it can be concluded that reproductive parameters including early embryonic development were 
not adversely affected in rats following treatment with rimegepant up to 60 mg/kg/d. TK values which 
were only obtained in the second study, revealed exposure margins of 12-13 and 16-24 times the human 
exposure at the NOAEL of 25 mg/kg/day for male and female rats, respectively. Using exposure levels 
from  other  rat  studies  for  a  dose  of  60  mg/kg/d,  exposure  margins  were  29  times  and  46  times  the 
human exposure at the MRHD. 
Embryofetal  development  (EFD)  studies  are  considered  adequate  to  conclude  that  embryofetal 
development  was  affected  neither  in  rats  at  doses  ≤  60  mg/kg  /d  nor  in  rabbits  at  ≤  50  mg/kg/d, 
respectively.  
Rimegepant did neither induce maternal nor developmental toxicity when administered to pregnant rats 
during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (46 times the human exposure at the 
Maximum  Recommended Human  Dose  (MRHD)).  Rimegepant-related  developmental  toxicity  (reduced 
fetal body weights and delayed ossification) was limited to fetuses of dams treated with 300 mg/kg/day, 
a  dose  associated  with  mild  maternal  toxicity.  In  rabbits,  rimegepant  was  neither  embryolethal  nor 
teratogenic when administered to pregnant rabbits over the period of organogenesis at doses up to 50 
mg/kg/day (10 times the human exposure at the MRHD), a dose associated with maternal toxicity. 
As some deficits were identified in an initial prenatal and postnatal development (PPND) study another 
study  using  the  same  strain  of  rats  and  identical  dosages  was  conducted.  Overall,  the  parameters 
evaluated  in  both  of  the  studies  are  considered  adequate  to  meet  the  requirements  of  ICHS5  for 
comprehensive assessment of possible rimegepant induced effects on postnatal development. Treatment 
of  female  rats  during  the  period  of  gestation  and  lactation  did  not  affect  growth,  reflex,  sensory  and 
neuromuscular development, learning and memory or the capability for reproduction in the offspring at 
doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (≥ 24 times the human exposure at the MRHD).  
No  data  are  available  on  placental  transfer  or  the  secretion  of  rimegepant  into  the  milk  in  lactating 
animals. However, the applicant included into section 4.6 of the SmPC preliminary PK data obtained in 
a Phase 1 study in 12 breastfeeding women following a single dose of rimegepant. It was estimated that 
less than 1% of the maternal dose will reach the breast fed infant. At present, the information proposed 
for the section “Breast feeding” is considered sufficient for the prescriber. Following finalisation of the 
study report, specific PK data may be included in section 5.2 of the SmPC with cross reference to section 
4.6 “Breast feeding” and vice versa in the course of variation procedure.

Juvenile toxicity studies in rats were submitted. However, as there is no paediatric indication yet, these 
studies were not assessed in detail in the course of this assessment. 
Phototoxicity 
Rimegepant absorbs light in the UVB range. At the absorbance maxima of 293 nm the molar extinction 
coefficient of rimegepant (13500 Lmol-1/cm) was greater than the threshold (1000 Lmol-1/cm).  
A  single-dose tissue  distribution  study  in  pigmented  and  albino  rats  demonstrated  that  rimegepant  is 
widely distributed extravascularly and likely binds to melanin. However, as outlined in ICH S10 guideline, 
penetration of UVB light into human skin is mainly limited to the epidermis and thus the clinical relevance 
of  photochemical  activation  by  UVB  is  considered  less  important  than  activation  by  UVA  for  systemic 
drugs. 
An in vitro phototoxicity testing of rimegepant free base was submitted. Rimegepant free base revealed 
no  phototoxic  potential  in  the  in  vitro  neutral  red  uptake  phototoxicity  assay  in  BALB/c  3T3  mouse 
fibroblasts. Also rimegepant (substance and medicinal product) is photostable. Phototoxic reactions are 
unlikely based on the above finding.  
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
At present the environmental risk assessment (ERA) cannot be finalised. A post-authorisation measure 
need to be addressed. 
The  applicant  has  submitted  the  report  detailing  the  experimental  determination  of  the  log  Kow  of 
rimegepant sulfate in accordance with OECD Test Guidelines (determined using the Shake Flask method).  
The estimated log (P) Kow value for rimegepant sulfate has been experimentally determined to be 0.806. 
Therefore, there is no PBT risk. The applicant used a default Fpen value resulting in a PECsurfacewater of 
0.375 µg/l that clearly exceeds the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. Therefore, a phase II risk assessment is 
deemed necessary.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic data of rimegepant were sufficiently discussed by the applicant.  
Pharmacokinetic  data  of  rimegepant  were  sufficiently  discussed  by  the  applicant.  Pharmacokinetic 
findings on possible drug-drug interactions (DDIs) of rimegepant are labelled in section 5.2 of the SmPC.

Repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in rats (up to 6-month) and monkeys (up to 9-month). The 
toxicity  profile  of  rimegepant  in  both  species  seems  to  be  low  and  approximately  similar.  All  findings 
were transient and reversible after recovery. 
Major toxicity findings [rat (hepatic lipidosis, intravascular hemolysis), monkey (emesis, intravascular 
hemolysis)] with safety margins based on exposure were represented in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Rimegepant was negative for genetic toxicity in vitro and in vivo and was not carcinogenic in a 6 months 
study in hemizygous Tg.rasH2 mice and a 2 years study in rats.  
Reproductive toxicity studies conducted and rats and rabbits were considered adequate for assessment 
of possible rimegepant-induced effects on reproduction. There were no adverse findings on reproductive 
parameters in rats up to exposure levels of least 24 times the human exposure in rats and at 10 times 
the human exposure at the MRHD, respectively. No embryotoxicity was noted in rabbits. 
Rimegepant absorbs light in the UVB range. Rimegepant free base revealed no phototoxic potential in 
the in  vitro  neutral  red  uptake  phototoxicity  assay  in  BALB/c  3T3  mouse  fibroblasts.  Also  rimegepant 
(substance and medicinal product) is photostable. Phototoxic reactions are unlikely based on the above 
finding. 
At present the ERA cannot be finalised. As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not 
allow to conclude on the potential risk of rimegepant sulfate to the environment. The applicant has been 
requested to conduct a phase II ERA for the active ingredient and submit the full study reports as post-
authorisation measure. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  PD  and  PK  data  presented  in  the  nonclinical  package  was  sufficiently  discussed  by  the 
applicant.  The  toxicity  profile  of  RGP  is  expected  to  be  low,  transient  and  reversible.  RGP  was  not 
genotoxic in vitro and in vivo and was not carcinogenic in studies in mice and rats. RGP did not exert 
any embryotoxic or phototoxic effects. 
The  available  data  do  not  allow  to  conclude  on  the  potential  risk  of  RGP  sulfate  to  the  environment. 
Therefore, the applicant has been requested to conduct a phase II ERA for the active ingredient. 
Based  on  the  available  non-clinical  data  regarding  PD,  PK  and  toxicology  profile,  the  application  was 
considered approvable.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
The applicant is asked to conduct a phase II ERA for the active ingredient rimegepant sulfate 
and submit the full study reports by June 2023.

2.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Formulation development 
Three oral formulations of rimegepant, all claimed to be similar in bioavailability, were used during the 
course of the rimegepant development programme. A capsule (free-base) was developed and used in 
early  development.  Two  formulations  of  rimegepant  sulfate,  an  orodispersible  tablet  (ODT  drug 
formulation using Zydis® technology and a tablet formulation, have been developed for use in pivotal 
clinical studies. The ODT drug formulation has been developed for commercialisation. 
Mass balance 
Mass balance study CN170006 followed an open-label, non-randomised, 2-period, 3-treatment, single-
sequence, sequential cross-over design in healthy male subjects and was conducted  
• 
• 
• 
• 
To determine the absolute bioavailability (BA of rimegepant from the immediate release capsule 
in healthy male subjects. 
To  determine  the  mass  balance  recovery  of  radioactivity  following  the  oral  administration  of 
[14C]-rimegepant (300 mg). 
To describe the metabolism and elimination of [14C]-rimegepant after oral administration and 
To define the IV pharmacokinetics (PK) of rimegepant. 
A total of 24 subjects were enrolled (i.e., signed the consent form) and 8 subjects were administered 
study  treatment.  All  8  subjects  (all  male,  mean  age  38.9  [range  30-55]  years  old,  mean  body  mass 
index (BMI) 25.80 kg/m2 [range 19.9-29.9]) completed the study and were included in the safety and 
PK analyses. 
Rimegepant was administered in 2 periods as follows: 
Period 1:  
rimegepant reference oral formulation (150 mg capsule × 2) in the fasted state, and a 15-
minute infusion of [14C] -rimegepant (100 μg, containing not more than 10 kBq [270 nCi] 
14C) ending at 1 hour after the oral dose was administered. 
Period 2: 
[14C]-rimegepant  oral  suspension  (300  mg,  containing  not  more  than  3.29  MBq  [89  μCi] 
14C) in the fasted state. 
In Period 1, the absolute BA of rimegepant was determined by administration of a rimegepant reference 
oral  formulation  (2  x  150  mg  capsule)  in  the  fasted  state,  accompanied  by  an  additional  15-minute 
infusion of [14C]-rimegepant (100 μg, 270 nCi) ending at 1 hour after the oral dose was administered. 
Absolute bioavailability was determined by using dose-normalised area under the concentration time-
curves  from  time  zero  to  infinity  (AUC0-inf values  following  oral  and  IV  administration.  The  geometric 
mean absolute bioavailability was 64% (90% CI: 53%, 77%).

Period 1 (PK Population), Study CN170006 
In  Period  2,  the  peak  concentration  of  total  radioactivity  occurred  shortly  after  administration,  with 
concentrations declining in a biphasic manner and was not quantifiable after 24 hours post-dose. The 
mean plasma concentration-time profiles for rimegepant and total radioactivity were comparable over 
the first 24 hours after study drug administration.  
Figure 2: Radioactivity Period 2 Mean (±SD) Plasma Conc. -Time Profiles, Study 170006 
(Linear) 
Rimegepant  was  the  primary  circulating  component  in  plasma  with  88%  to  92%  unchanged  parent 
present throughout the first 4 hours. Over longer periods of time, compared to metabolites, unchanged 
rimegepant  represented  approximately  77%  of  the  total  administered  dose  with  only  low  levels  of 
circulating metabolites of rimegepant quantifiable. 
Radioactivity representing rimegepant and its metabolites after oral dosing was mainly excreted in the 
feces  (78%),  with  approximately  24%  excreted  in  the  urine.  The  AUC0-inf ratio  of  rimegepant  to  total 
radioactivity  was  77%,  which  indicated  that  although  there  were  metabolites  in  the  circulation, 
rimegepant was not extensively metabolised. Unchanged rimegepant was the major component found 
within faeces (42%) and urine (51%).

PK Study 110 was an open-label, randomised, crossover, replicate-design study conducted in 2 Parts. 
Part 1 assessed the definitive bioequivalence of the rimegepant 75 mg tablet and 75 mg ODT formulation 
administered sublingually in healthy adult men and women. Part 2 assessed the relative BA of the ODT 
when administered on top of the tongue or sublingually. 
Part 1 
For  ln-transformed  AUC0-t and  Cmax,  the  within  subject  coefficient  of  variation  was  30%  and  the  90% 
confidence intervals (CI) for the sublingual ODT/Tablet (test/reference) ratio, using MIXED procedures 
in SAS, was within the acceptance limits of 0.80 and 1.25 for both parameters, indicating bioequivalence 
of the rimegepant formulations. 
Table 12: Ln-transformed Rimegepant PK Parameters Bioequivalence Comparison Between 
Rimegepant Sublingual ODT and Rimegepant Tablet Treatments in Part I (EMA) (PK 
Population) Study 110 
The  median  untransformed  rimegepant  tmax values  were  1.50  hours  for  the  sublingual  ODT  and  1.93 
hours for the tablet. 
Part 2 
In  Part  2  of  Study  110,  two  ways  of  administration  of  ODT  tablets  were  compared,  i.e.  either  placed 
sublingually  or  on  top  of  the  tongue.  In  both  cases,  the  ODT  tablet  should  remain  until  completely 
dissolved and was then swallowed without water. Comparative BA points to similar AUC values with 90% 
CIs within the 80-125% acceptance range, however, Cmax was about 10% higher after SL administration 
(ratio 1.10 [0.96, 1.27]).

Sublingual ODT or On Top of the Tongue (Part 2) – PK Population, Study 110 
Median tmax was about 30 min earlier when the ODT tablet was administered sublingually (median tmax: 
SL 1.50 hr, on top of tongue 1.99 hour). 
Bioequivalence between ODT on top of the tongue and tablets, Study BHV3000-113 
Bioequivalence study 113 was conducted from Aug 2018 to Dec 2018. It was an open-label, randomised, 
single-dose study to compare the rate and extent of absorption of 75 mg rimegepant ODT administered 
on top of the tongue versus 75 mg rimegepant tablet under fasting conditions, and to evaluate the effect 
of food on the PK properties of rimegepant 75 mg ODT, administered on top of the tongue in healthy 
subjects. 
Part 1 - Bioequivalence 
The 90% CIs of the observed geometric mean ratios (GMR) of rimegepant 75 mg ODT administered on 
top of tongue / rimegepant 75 mg tablet for the AUC0-t: GMR = 98.45%, (93.68, 103.47), AUC0-inf: GMR 
=  98.45%,  (93.69,  112.01),  and  Cmax:  GMR  =  102.82,  (94.38,  112.01),  thereby  demonstrating 
bioequivalence under fasting conditions in healthy subjects for each parameter.

Median  tmax  values  were  similar  between  the  two  modes  of  administration  (median  tmax:  ODT  top  of 
tongue 2.0 hour, tablet 2.3 hour). 
Part 2 – Food effect 
For the rimegepant 75 mg ODT (placed on top of tongue), the GMRs (fed/fasted) and associated 90% 
CIs for AUC0-t: GMR = 62.18%, (55.48, 69.68), AUC0-inf: GMR = 62.29%, (55.60, 69.77), and Cmax: GMR 
=  46.57%,  (40.94,  52.97),  were  reduced  in  the  presence  of  a  high  fat  meal,  as  compared  to 
administration in the fasted state. 
Table 15: Plasma PK Parameters of Rimegepant after SD Administration of Rimegepant 75 
mg ODT Top of the Tongue Under Fed and Fasting Conditions, Study 113 
Rimegepant ODT administered on top of the tongue has a lower rate and extent of absorption under fed 
conditions when compared to fasting conditions as seen from the GMR for AUC and Cmax reduced by 38% 
and 53%, respectively.

sequence, crossover, study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effect of food on the PK properties of 
rimegepant tablet (not shown here in detail) and rimegepant ODT administered sublingually in healthy 
subjects, both under fed (high fat meal) and fasting conditions. 
Part 1 - ODT 75 mg Food Effect 
For the rimegepant 75 mg ODT administered sublingually, the GMRs (fed/fasted) and associated 90% 
CIs for AUC0-t: GMR = 68.26%, (61.56, 75.70), AUC0-inf: GMR = 68.31, (61.65, 75.69), and Cmax: GMR 
= 58.78, (51.51, 67.08), were reduced in the presence of a high fat meal, compared to the fasted state. 
Table 16: Statistical Comparisons for the Plasma PK Parameters of Rimegepant 75 mg ODT 
Under Fed and Fasting Conditions, Study 112 
Rimegepant  ODT  administered  sublingually  has  a  lower  rate  and  extent  of  absorption  under  fed 
conditions when compared to fasting conditions as seen from the GMRs for AUC and Cmax, reduced by 
32% and 41%, respectively. Under fed conditions, maximum plasma concentration are achieved about 
one hour later as compared to the fasted state (mean tmax: fed 3.4 hour, fasted 2.4 hour). 
Effect of low-fat meal on PK of rimegepant ODT, sublingual, BHV3000-120 
Study  120  was  conducted  at  Syneos  Health,  Québec,  Canada  from  Oct  2019  to  Dec  2019.  It  was  an 
open-label, randomised, single-dose, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover study to evaluate the effect of a 
low-fat meal on the PK of rimegepant 75 mg ODT, administered sublingually in healthy volunteers. 
For Treatment A (sublingual, fed), after a supervised fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will be served a 
low-fat,  low-calorie  meal  of  approximately  400  to  500  calories  (approximately  25%  of  total  caloric 
content of the meal derived from fat). 
The so-called low-fat, low-calorie meal contains exactly half the calorie amount (400-500 calories) and 
half the percent fat content (25%) as compared to the standardised high-fat, high-calorie meal. 
For the rimegepant 75 mg ODT administered sublingually, the GMRs, fed/fasted) and associated 90% 
CIs for AUC0-t: GMR  = 71.8%, (66.6, 77.4), AUC0-inf: GMR = 71.8% (66.6, 77.4), and Cmax: GMR = 
63.9% (56.9, 71.8), indicate a reduction of exposure in the presence of a low fat meal, compared to the 
fasted state. These findings can also be expressed as reductions in AUC0-t of 28%, in AUC0-inf of 28%, 
and in Cmax of 36% in the presence of a low fat meal as compared to the fasted state. The median tmax 
increased from 2.0 hours under the fasting condition to 3.5 hours under the fed condition.

Comparative  bioavailability  Study  117  was  conducted  at  Syneos  Health,  Miami,  Florida,  US  from  Oct 
2019 to Dec 2019. Rimegepant 10, 25, and 75 mg ODT were administered as a single oral dose on top 
of  the  tongue  in  HV  under  fasting  conditions  following  a  3-period,  6-sequence,  dose-proportionality 
crossover design. 
The rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of rimegepant ODT absorption increased with dose over the range of 
10 to 75 mg when administered on top of the tongue under fasting conditions. The mean tmax at 10 and 
25 mg was similar (1.5 hours) and earlier relative to the 75 mg dose (3 hours). The mean t½ el increased 
with dose across the explored dose range (t1/2: 10 mg: 5.5 hour, 75 mg: 8.5 hour). 
Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  rimegepant  ODT  administered  on  top  of  the  tongue  under  fasting 
conditions, a greater than dose-proportional exposure of rimegepant was observed over the rimegepant 
ODT  dose  range  of  10  to  75  mg.  The  power  model  slope  estimates  for  AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf,  Cmax  (1.197, 
1.181, and 1.164, respectively) and their corresponding 90% CI ([1.156, 1.238], [1.140, 1.222], and 
[1.107, 1.221], respectively) were each above and outside the interval criteria range of (0.889, 1.111).

Single (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of BMS-927711 
Early  (first-in-human)  Phase  I  study  CN170001  was  conducted  at  Comprehensive  Neuroscience  Inc., 
Miami, Florida, US from Dec 2010 to Sep 2011. 
Part A (SAD) 
Four (4) men and 4 women of non-childbearing potential, 18 to 55 years, were enrolled in each of the 7 
sequential panels (25, 75, 150, 300, 600, 900, and 1500 mg). In each panel, subjects were randomly 
assigned  to  receive  either  a  SD  of  BMS-927711  or  placebo  in  a  3  to  1  ratio,  stratified  by  gender.  In 
addition, a second period was conducted as a crossover on 2 panels (150 and 300 mg) to assess the 
effect of pH (40 mg famotidine 2 hour prior to RGP dose) and food (RGP dose within 5 min of completing 
a standard high-fat meal) on the PK of BMS-927711.

Table 18: Summary Statistics for BMS-927711 PK Parameters after Single Oral Doses, Study 
CN170001, Part A 
BMS-927711 was rapidly absorbed with the median tmax ranging from 1h (75 mg dose) to 4 h (300 mg 
dose, fed conditions). A large range of inter-subject variability (22-85%) was seen in the PK parameters 
for BMS-927711 across different doses. BMS-927711 exposures, as measured by Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-
inf increased with increase in dose over the single dose range of 25 to 900 mg under fasting conditions. 
The dose of 1500 mg had exposure values less than those following the 600 and 900 mg doses.

The t½ of BMS-927711 ranged from 8-12 h after a single oral dose. Co-administration of a single oral 
dose  of  150-mg  BMS-927711  with  famotidine  decreased  the  Cmax  (to  26%)  and  AUC  (to  43%)  when 
compared to BMS-927711 administered alone. 
Due to small sample size and high PK variability, there was no consistent pattern of gender difference in 
exposure  across  dose  groups.  However,  female  subjects  had  higher  exposure  (~2.5  fold)  than  male 
subjects in the 300-mg dose group. 
Part B (MAD) 
Four (4) men and 4 women of non-childbearing potential, age 18 to 55 years, were randomised within 
each  dose  panel  to  receive  BMS-927711  or  placebo  in  a  ratio  of  3:1  (stratified  by  gender).  Five  (5) 
sequential  dose  panels  were  planned  (75,  150,  300,  450  and  600  mg).  BMS-927711  or  placebo  was 
administered in the fasted state once daily for 14 days as a capsule. In addition, 300 mg (Panel 12) was 
administered twice daily in the fasted state 2 h apart for 14 days based on the tolerability of the previous 
600 mg once-daily dose. 
The accumulation index (AIs) remained constant at approximately 1.4 over the 75, 150, and 300 mg QD 
dose range, while increasing with the 450 (1.6) and 600 mg (2.3) QD doses. A similar trend was seen 
in the effective t1/2 of BMS-927711 where the values were similar (13-19 h) in the 75, 150, 300, and 450 
mg QD dose groups and longer effective t1/2 were seen at the 600 (31 h) QD mg dose. 
To assess the dose-systemic exposure relationship over the multiple dose range of 75 to 600 mg QD, 
the power model was used.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Phase I study CN170004 was conducted from 17-Nov-2011 to 14-Sep-2012 at four US sites. It examined 
the  SD  PK  profile  of  rimegepant  (300  mg  and  600  mg)  in  the  target  population  of  migraine  subjects 
during a migraine attack as compared to the interictal period.  
Rimegepant exposures (Cmax and AUC) following migraine were generally higher than exposures in non-
migraine subjects at both the 300 mg and 600 mg single doses.

mL/min/1.73  m2) were  matched to  subjects  with  RI (mild,  moderate,  or  severe)  according  to  gender, 
age (± 10 years), and BMI (± 15%) to the extent possible. 
Subjects with RI (Groups 2-4) included: 
•  60 - 89 mL/min/1.73 m² (Group 2 – mild group); 
•  30 – 59 mL/min/1.73 m² (Group 3 – moderate group); 
•  < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (Group 4 – severe group) not requiring dialysis. 
The  ratios  of  AUC  for  mild  RI  and  severe  RI  compared  to  their  respective  matched  controls  were 
approximately 100%. For the moderate RI group, the AUCs were increased compared with the matched 
controls,  with  ratios  of  approximately  140%.  However,  Cmax  was  increased  in  the  mild  RI  group  and 
decreased in the moderate and severe RI groups vs control.

Table 21: Comparison of Renal Impairment States to Matched Controls after SD 
administration of 75 mg Rimegepant, Study BHV3000-106 
Although a less than 50% increase in total rimegepant exposure was observed following a single 75 mg 
dose, the unbound AUC of rimegepant was approximately 40% 2.57-fold higher in subjects with severe 
renal  impairment.  Caution  is  recommended  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  frequent 
rimegepant use. 
Hepatic impairment 
Hepatic  impairment  study  BHV3000-107  was  conducted  at  inVentiv  Health  Clinical  Research  Services 
LLC., Miami, Florida, US and at the Division of Clinical Pharmacology, University Miami, Florida, US from 
05-Sep-2017 to 19-Feb-2018.  
It examined the effect of various categories of severity of hepatic impairment on the PK of rimegepant 
following a 75 mg single dose (administered as tablet) in subjects with normal hepatic function, mild, 
moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. 
Healthy  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function  (Group  1)  were  matched  to  subjects  with  hepatic 
impairment  (mild,  moderate,  or  severe)  according  to  gender,  age  (±  10  years),  and  BMI  (±  15%). 
Subjects were assigned to a group according to their degree of hepatic impairment based on Child-Pugh 
score, as follows: 
•  Group 1: 18 healthy subjects with normal hepatic function (control group) 
•  Group 2: 6 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Group A: score 5-6 points) 
•  Group 3: 6 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Group B: score 7-9 points) 
•  Group 4: 6 subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Group C: score 10-15 points) 
For the mild and moderate hepatic impairment groups, there were no significant differences in AUC or 
Cmax compared with the matched control groups. But there was an increase in AUC and Cmax in the severe 
hepatic impairment group compared with the matched control group, with ratios for the severe HI group 
compared to the matched control group of 202% for AUC (p < 0.001) and 190% for Cmax (p = 0.009). 
Changes to median tmax in subjects with hepatic impairment were modest as compared to normal healthy 
subjects.

Pharmacokinetics in the elderly 
PK  study  BHV3000-108  was  conducted  at  Syneos  (formerly)  inVentiv  Health  Clinique  Inc.  Québec, 
Canada from 30-Sep-2017 to 30-Jan-2018. 
It examined the PK of a SD of 75 mg rimegepant (administered as tablet) in healthy elderly (aged > 65 
years) as compared to non-elderly (> 18 and < 45 years of age) following a parallel group design. A 
total of 28 subjects were administered study treatment, and all 28 subjects completed the study. All 28 
subjects were included in the safety and PK analyses. 
Administration of a single 75 mg dose of rimegepant resulted in small increases in AUC (< 5%) and a 
decrease in Cmax (< 5%) in elderly subjects as compared to non-elderly subjects. For rimegepant AUC0-t, 
AUC0-inf, and Cmax values, there were no statistically significant differences between the elderly and non-
elderly groups of subjects. The ratio (elderly/non-elderly) for AUC0-t was 104.5 (90% CI: 81.40, 134.19, 
p=0.766), for AUC0-inf was 104.6 (90% CI: 81.59, 134.15, p=0.759), and for Cmax was 96.6 (90% CI: 
70.71, 131.83, p=0.849). The results for the secondary PK endpoints showed a statistically significant 
increase of 4.9 hours in untransformed t1/2 el in elderly subjects (p=0.016).

Population pharmacokinetics 
A PPK model has been developed with data of eight studies in healthy volunteers including subjects with 
different degrees of renal and hepatic impairment and elderly people. A two-compartment disposition 
model  for  rimegepant  with  4  transit  compartments  of  absorption  into  the  central  compartment  was 
identified to best describe the time course of the plasma concentration-time course of rimegepant. The 
following statistically significant covariates were identified in the final model: Allometric weight scaling 
on clearance and volume parameters, Fluconazole and itraconazole use (moderate and strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor, respectively), and severe/moderate hepatic impairment on elimination clearance, fed status, 
itraconazole use, capsule formulation, and ODT on transit absorption rate constant (ktr), fed status on 
bioavailability. Impacts on exposure by the statistically significant parameters were not clinically relevant 
with the exception of strong CYP3A inhibitors. SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5 specify that rimegepant is not 
recommended for concomitant use with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4.

Acute Treatment of migraine attacks – Dose ranging study 
Phase 2b dose ranging study CN170003 was conducted from Oct-2011 to May-2012 at 41 sites in the 
US. CN170003 was a response-adaptive, double-blind, randomised, multi-centre, outpatient evaluation 
of the safety, efficacy, and dose-response of BMS-927711, as compared to placebo, in the treatment of 
moderate to severe migraine headache. Subjects were randomised to receive placebo, sumatriptan 100 
mg active control, or 1 of 6 doses of BMS-927711: 10 mg, 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg. 
The study was divided into 3 phases: a screening/baseline phase (3-28 days), an acute treatment phase 
(up to 45 days during which time subjects treated 1 migraine headache of moderate to severe intensity), 
followed by an EOT visit within 7 days of administration of study medication. 
Subjects were included if presenting with at least a 1-year history of migraines (with or without aura), 
age of onset prior to 50 years, migraine attacks (on average) lasting about 4 - 72 hours if untreated, 
and not more than 8 attacks of moderate to severe intensity per month within the last 3 months. 
Eligible subjects had to report less than 15 days with headache (migraine or non-migraine) per month 
in each of the 3 months prior to the screening visit and maintained this requirement during the screening 
period. Prophylactic migraine medication was permitted while on study therapy provided the dose was 
stable  dose  for  at  least  3 months  prior  to  study  entry.  A  total  of  1,026  subjects  were  enrolled  in the 
study, and 86.3% (885) of these were randomised to treatment. Of the 885 randomised subjects, 812 
(79.1%) completed the study.  
Efficacy  was  measured  as  the  portion  of  subjects  achieving  pain  freedom  at  2  hours  post-dose,  i.e. 
headache  pain  intensity  reported  as  “no  pain”  using  a  four  point  rating  scale  (no  pain,  mild  pain, 
moderate pain, severe pain). Additionally, total migraine freedom was measured (composite endpoint 
consisting  of  headache  pain  freedom  coupled  with  no  symptoms  of  photophobia,  phonophobia,  and 
nausea at 2 hours post-dose).

Figure 6: Phase 2b Primary Endpoint: Rimegepant Pain Freedom at 2 hours Post Dose (+/- 
95% Confidence), Study CN170003 
Results of the Bayesian model showed that among the BMS-927711 doses, the 150 mg dose was the 
most effective with 32.9% of subjects achieving pain freedom at 2 hours post-dose. The 75 mg, 150 mg 
and 300 mg doses of BMS-927711 were similar, with response rates of 31.4% (p = 0.0018), 32.9% (p 
=  0.0005)  and  29.7%  (p  =  0.0024),  respectively.  All  3  doses  were  significantly  better  than  placebo 
(15.2%). The efficacy of the 600 mg dose (response rate of 24.4%) was not significantly better than 
placebo. The difference in the percentage of pain-free subjects at 2 hours post-dose between sumatriptan 
(35%)  and  placebo  (15.3%)  was  statistically  significant  (p  <  0.0001)  and  consistent  with  historical 
norms.

Figure 8: Phase 2b Dose-ranging Study CN170003, Sustained Pain Freedom and Pain Relief 
from 2-24 hours post-dose 
Sumatriptan and several dose levels of BMS-927711 had a significantly greater percentage of subjects 
with  sustained  pain  freedom  from  2  to  24  hours  post-dose  as  compared  with  placebo:  26.0%  for 
sumatriptan,  28.2%  for  150  mg,  27.9%  for  75  mg,  26.1%  for  300  mg,  20.7%  for  the  600  mg,  and 
16.4% for the 25 mg dose groups. 
Pharmacodynamic interaction with sumatriptan on blood pressure 
The primary objective of Study 114 (Oct-2018 to Nov-2018) was to evaluate the effect of rimegepant 
on resting BP when administered concomitantly with sumatriptan in healthy subjects. As a secondary 
objective, the PK of sumatriptan when administered alone and concomitantly with rimegepant in healthy 
subjects were assessed. 
Sumatriptan succinate injection was administered as two subcutaneous (SC injections of 6 mg/0.5 mL 
separated by approximately 1 hour for a total dose of 12 mg on Days 1 and 5. Rimegepant 75 mg (tablet) 
or placebo was administered once daily for 4 consecutive days from Day 2 to Day 5. Since sumatriptan 
was administered as a SC injection, only rimegepant and placebo were administered in a double-blinded 
fashion. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either rimegepant or matching placebo in a 6 to 1 
ratio. 
The  safety  and  tolerability  of  rimegepant,  sumatriptan,  and  placebo  were  evaluated  through  the 
assessment  of  adverse  events  (AEs),  clinical  laboratory  parameters  (biochemistry,  haematology,  and 
urinalysis), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (S-STS, and 
physical examination. 
Automated Blood Pressure Analyses 
Following a manual recording at pre-dose, a total of 37 automated BP recordings were performed over 
a 15-hour period at pre-determined time points just after the first sumatriptan injection on Day 1 and 
rimegepant administration on Days 4 and 5 as follows: 
•  Every 10 minutes for the first 4 hours 
•  Every 30 minutes for the next 2 hours 
•  Every 60 minutes for the last 9 hours

A manual BP recording was also performed approximately 24 hours post-dose in the morning of Day 3. 
BP at 24 hour post dose using the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring system was collected in the 
mornings of Days 2, 5, and 6. 
Table 24: Comparisons of Time Weighted Average Median Arterial BP, SBP and DBP Between 
Rimegepant and Sumatriptan Co-administration and Sumatriptan Alone, Study 114 
No relevant differences were observed for vital signs measurements over time. No significant difference 
was detected in time weighted average BP measures of mean arterial pressure, systolic (SBP) or diastolic 
pressures (DBP) between co-administration of rimegepant and sumatriptan as compared to sumatriptan 
administration alone. 
TQTc study 
Study 180099 (Aug 2018 to Oct 2018) was a randomised, partially double-blind, placebo- and positive-
controlled,  4-way  crossover,  single-centre  study  of  oral  Rimegepant  at  therapeutic  (75  mg)  and 
supratherapeutic (300 mg) doses, administered as single doses, in healthy adults. Moxifloxacin (a single 
400-mg oral dose) was used as a positive control.

Mean change-from-baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) on rimegepant followed closely the placebo pattern and did 
not suggest an effect on cardiac repolarisation. Mean ΔQTcF values on rimegepant were negative at all 
post-dose time points, with the exception a ΔQTcF value of 0.2 msec at 5 hours post-dose in subjects 
dosed  with  300  mg  rimegepant.  As  a  result,  mean  placebo-corrected  ΔQTcF  (ΔΔQTcF)  was  also  very 
small and ranged from -1.4 msec at 2 hours post-dose to 2.0 msec at 3.5 hours post-dose, both after 
dosing  with  75  mg  rimegepant  and  ΔΔQTcF  was  within  ±  1.6  msec  upon  treatment  with  300  mg 
rimegepant. After dosing with moxifloxacin, a clear increase of mean ΔΔQTcF was observed with a peak 
value of 14.1 msec (90% CI: 12.10 to 16.20) at 3.5 hours post-dose. There were no treatment-emergent 
T-wave or U-wave morphology changes. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Targeted ≥ 90% inhibition of CGRP-signalling 
Primate CGRP PD and human PK identified rimegepant 75 mg as the human dose where ≥ 90% inhibition 
of CGRP-signalling would occur (the predicted target for efficacy). 
Dose selection for rimegepant in migraine was supported from preclinical and phase 1 safety data as 
well as PD data in primates (marmosets) using the CGRP-induced dermal blood flow assay. This assay 
employs a strong agonist dose of human-αCGRP (10 μg/kg, IV) that is designed to mimic waves of CGRP 
release  during  a  migraine  attack  (human  plasma  levels  of  CGRP  rise  substantially  during  migraine, 
reflecting CGRP release from trigeminal afferents). Rimegepant was expected to inhibit CGRP-induced 
increases in dermal blood flow. 
In early studies, rimegepant 0.3 mg/kg SC produced ≤ 17% inhibition, 1 mg/kg produced up to 46% 
inhibition, 3 mg/kg produced up to 66% inhibition, and 7 mg/kg produced up to 80% inhibition of CGRP-
induced increases in dermal blood flow. Based on these data and multispecies allometric scaling, it was 
predicted that a human single dose of 70 to 140 mg would be efficacious in migraine with a Cmax target

of 750 nM (400 ng/mL) to provide ≥ 90% inhibition of CGRP-signalling (the predicted PD inhibition target 
for efficacy). Based on clinical exposures from Phase 1 (CN1700018), rimegepant 75 mg was identified 
as the lowest dose to achieve this Cmax target, and the next lowest dose 25 mg was shown to fail to 
reach the target. 
Previously, four injectable CGRP mAbs (erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab and eptinezumab) and 
one  other  orally-administered  CGRP  receptor  antagonist  (atogepant),  have  all  demonstrated  clinical 
efficacy in migraine prevention, with a common mechanism of inhibiting CGRP signalling. (Goadsby et 
al.  2017)  Two  of  these  agents,  erenumab  and  eptinezumab,  conducted  pharmacodynamic  inhibition 
efficacy-exposure studies to guide clinical dose selection in prevention. Both agents showed that a Cmax 
with ≥ 90% inhibition was required for efficacy in migraine prevention. Clinical doses that failed to achieve 
a Cmax with ≥ 90% inhibition were ineffective and dosing higher did not provide added therapeutic benefit.

Rationale  for  Dose  Selection  from  Human  PK  Modelling  of  EOD  (every  other  day)  Expected 
Exposures and CGRP Inhibition 
Rimegepant has consistently shown sustained benefits through 48 hours after a single rimegepant 75 
mg dose was administered for the treatment of migraine (CN170003, BHV3000-301, BHV3000-302, and 
BHV3000-303). Most recently, single dose rimegepant 75 mg showed statistically significant effects over 
2  to  48  hour  on  four  measures  of  durable  efficacy:  sustained  pain  freedom  2  to  48  hour,  sustained 
freedom from MBS 2 to 48 hour, sustained ability to function normally 2 to 48 hour and sustained pain 
relief  2  to  48  hour.  These  comprehensive  and  durable  benefits  through  48  hours  from  a  single  dose 
suggest that daily dosing would not be required for a clinically meaningful preventive effect. 
It has not been established that constant high blockade of CGRP-signalling is required for efficacy in the 
preventive treatment of migraine. Other CGRP signal-blocking agents, including a long-acting injectable 
CGRP mAb  (erenumab)  and  daily  dosing  of  another  oral  CGRP  receptor  antagonist  (atogepant),  have 
shown an unwanted signal of constipation when administered for the preventive treatment of migraine. 
Therefore,  as  part  of  the  rimegepant  dose  selection  process  the  expected  exposure  profile  and  its 
potential effects on providing a more favourable safety/tolerability profile was considered. Rimegepant 
has a favourable PK profile with a t1/2 of ~11 hours. In this regard, the PK profile of oral rimegepant has 
the potential to provide both effective therapy (with periods of maximal CGRP inhibition ≥ 90%) and a 
respite from prolonged blockade (by planned regular excursions into periods of lower CGRP inhibition) 
when administered in an EOD regimen. 
A population PK model utilizing 10 clinical studies and 337 healthy subjects given doses ranging from 10 
to 150 mg was used to simulate single-dose and steady-state rimegepant exposures (e.g., Cmax, AUC, 
and overall PK profiles) from dosing scenarios of interest. A representative population of virtual subjects 
(n = 1,000) were resampled from the analysis dataset demography.

Simulations  over  48  hours  for  single  and  steady-state  EOD  dose  of  rimegepant  25  mg  (anticipated 
ineffective  dose)  and  75  mg  (anticipated  effective  dose)  were  generated.  There  is  little  accumulation 
with the EOD dosing regimen, and consequently the simulated Cmax and 48 hour AUC are similar whether 
given  as  a  single  dose  or  at  steady-state  (ss)  after  EOD  for  both  rimegepant  25  mg  and  75  mg. 
Comparing the exposure profiles of the two doses there is minimal overlap in the 90% CI for Cmax and 
48 hour AUC between the 25 mg and 75 mg doses. 
The clinical exposure required for efficacy in migraine was predicted based on PK-PD modelling data from 
a primate pharmacodynamic in vivo efficacy assay measuring CGRP inhibition. A target of ≥ 90% CGRP 
inhibition was established for the acute treatment of migraine and also for the preventive treatment of 
migraine.  The  aim  was  to  provide  both  effective  therapy  (with  periods  of  maximal  CGRP  inhibition  ≥ 
90%) and support safety/tolerability with repeated use (by planned regular excursions into periods of 
lower CGRP inhibition). The target for prevention was further supported by analysis of publicly available 
PK-PD data from two previously approved competitor CGRP signal-inhibiting agents which indicated that 
a Cmax with ≥ 90% CGRP inhibition was required for therapeutic benefit in the preventive treatment of 
migraine. A Phase 2b dose-ranging study in the acute treatment of migraine confirmed rimegepant 75 
mg as the minimum fully efficacious dose that provided 48 hour comprehensive and durable efficacy on 
multiple  outcome  measures  (with  no  clinical  benefit  observed  by  dosing  up  to  8x  higher).  The  initial 
clinical data from Study BHV3000-201, showing reductions in monthly migraine days (MMD) in a cohort 
of patients treated every other day (EOD), was confirmed in a subsequent pivotal clinical trial (BHV3000-
305)  demonstrating  that  rimegepant  75  mg  dosed  EOD  was  effective  in  the  preventive  treatment  of 
migraine (without a signal for constipation seen with other CGRP blocking agents). Discussion on clinical 
pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
A comprehensive PK study programme was provided to delineate the PK profile of rimegepant (RGP) 75 
mg ODT. The ODT tablet formulation is proposed to be administered either sublingually or on top of the 
tongue. For the treatment of acute migraine attacks, one 75 mg ODT tablet is to be taken as needed 
without the option of a second dose within the same day. If taken for migraine prevention, one 75 mg 
ODT tablet is proposed to be regularly taken EOD). 
The  pivotal  phase  III  studies  were  partly  conducted  with  the  rimegepant  per  oral  tablet  formulation 
(single  attack  studies  301/302,  prevention  study  305),  and  with  the  ODT  formulation  intended  to  be 
marketed  (single  attack  study  303).  Therefore,  demonstration  of  bioequivalence  across  the  ODT  and 
tablet  formulations  is  essential  to  mutually  bridge  the  existing  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  data. 
Bioequivalence between the tablet and the ODT formulation could be shown in two dedicated studies, 
Study  110  for  the  sublingual  ODT  application,  and Study  113  for  the ODT  to  be  placed  on  top  of  the 
tongue. The was around 8 hours for both ODT and per oral tablet. After (and on top of tongue) placement 
of the ODT tablet, the subject has to wait until completely dissolved and then swallow without water. 
Notably, tmax was earlier for ODT sublingual (1.5 hour) as compared to the per oral tablet (1.9 hour), 
despite the fact that the tablet was swallowed with water. The portion of transmucosal absorption of RGP 
after oromucosal placement of ODT tablets is assumed to be negligible. ODT tablets (either on top of or 
under the tongue, as recorded during PK studies) disintegrate within seconds after contact with saliva. 
In Part 2 of Study 110, the two ways of administration of ODT tablets were directly compared, i.e. either 
placed sublingually or on top of the tongue. In both cases, the ODT tablet should remain until completely 
dissolved and was then swallowed without water. Comparative BA points to similar AUC values with 90% 
CIs within the 80-125% acceptance range, however, Cmax was about 10% higher after SL administration 
(ratio 1.10 [0.96, 1.27]). Median tmax was about 30 min earlier when the ODT tablet was administered 
sublingually (median tmax: SL 1.50 hour, on top of tongue 1.99 hour). In pivotal single attack Study 303, 
the  ODT  tablet  was  placed  sublingually.  Hence,  there  are  no  clinical  data  obtained  for  the  on  top  of 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 48/135

tongue  ODT  application.  The  posology  section  of  the  proposed  SmPC  specifies  that  the  ODT  may  be 
placed on the tongue or under the tongue. 
In the treatment of acute migraine attacks, the onset of effect of medication is of critical importance. 
The  rimegepant  tablets  were  compared  with  ODT  in  two  separate  studies  for sublingual  (Study  110), 
resp. on top of tongue placement (Study 113). In Study 110, the median untransformed rimegepant tmax 
values were 1.50 hours for the SL ODT and 1.93 hours for the tablet. If placed on top of tongue, the 
median tmax was 2.0 hours for ODT, as compared to 2.3 hours for the tablets (Study 113). Hence, the 
benefit of the ODT formulation as compared to tablets in terms of rapid increase in blood levels is not 
evident. However, it is acknowledged that due to associated symptoms of nausea / vomiting it may be 
advantageous for some patients to administer the ODT tablet without water in acute migraine attacks. 
A considerable food effect was observed for the ODT formulation. Rimegepant ODT, administered either 
sublingually or on top of tongue, has a lower rate and extent of absorption after ingestion of a standard 
high-fat meal when compared to fasting conditions. The GMRs for AUC and Cmax reduced by 32% and 
41%  after  sublingual  administration  (Study  112),  and  by  38%  and  53%,  if  placed  on  top  of  tongue 
(Study 113). Under fed conditions, maximum plasma concentration are achieved about one hour later 
as compared to the fasted state (mean tmax: fed 3.4 hour, fasted 2.4 hour). In clinical trials, rimegepant 
was  administered  irrespective  of  any  meals  taken  or  not.  By  its  nature  as  a  medication  designed  for 
acute  treatment  of  migraine  attacks,  which  are  often  accompanied  by  nausea  and/or  vomiting,  any 
recommendation  in  terms  of  food  intake  may  hardly  reflect  clinical  practice.  In  any  way,  given  the 
magnitude  of  food  effect,  SmPC  section  5.2  gives  due  account  about  the  food  effect  on  the  PK  of 
rimegepant. It is important for transferability of pivotal clinical data obtained with the RGP tablet, that 
the food effect observed for the tablet formulation was similar in nature (decrease of AUC, Cmax; delay 
of tmax by about one hour) and magnitude as compared to ODT. 
Study 120 further examined the food effect observed in studies 112/113 by measuring the exposure of 
rimegepant  (75  mg  ODT,  sublingual)  after  ingestion  of  a  low-fat,  low  calorie  (exactly  half  the  calorie 
amount [400-500 calories] and fat content [25%], as compared to a standard high-fat meal). In general, 
PK results obtained from Study 120 (low-fat, low-calorie meal) confirm those previously obtained from 
Study 112, which examined the food effect of a high-fat, high-calorie standard meal. While ingestion of 
a high-fat meal lead to about 32% resp, 41% decrease of AUC and Cmax (Study 112) after SD sublingual 
administration of rimegepant 75 mg ODT, AUC was reduced by 28% and Cmax was reduced by 36% if the 
respective  meal  contained  half  as  much  fat  /  calories  (Study  120).  Under  both  conditions,  tmax  was 
delayed by 1-1.5 hours under fed conditions. 
Along the same line as the food effect observed for rimegepant, the availability of RGP (if administered 
as free base) appears to be dependent on pH conditions in the GIT. In Part A of study CN170001, pre-
treatment with histamine-2 antagonist famotidine (150 mg, 2 hour prior to rimegepant dosing) lead to 
markedly  reduced  rimegepant  exposure  (Cmax  and  AUC  reduced  by  75%  resp.  57%).  The  decreased 
availability of rimegepant after prior treatment with antacids is in line with RGP’s pH solubility profile 
revealing an about 100-fold decrease in solubility if the pH is increased from pH 1.4 to pH 6.8. 
In  [14C]  mass  balance  Study  CN170006,  radio-chromatographic  profiling  of  plasma,  urine  and  faecal 
samples  revealed  that  in  plasma,  unchanged  parent  was  the  most  prominent  drug-related  circulating 
component,  no  major  metabolite  (i.e.,  representing  >10%  of  drug-related  material)  was  present  in 
plasma. The AUC0-inf ratio of rimegepant to total radioactivity was 77%, which indicated that although 
there were metabolites in the circulation, rimegepant was predominant. On the other side, rimegepant 
was extensively metabolised to a wide variety of minor metabolites with an overall low rate of metabolic 
clearance  prior  to  elimination.  The  primary  biotransformation  pathway  was  the  cleavage  of  the 
carbamate  bond  of  the  RGP  molecule,  apart  from  hydroxylation  and  formation  of  a  number  of  minor 
secondary oxidative metabolites. Rimegepant and its metabolites were primarily eliminated in the faeces 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 49/135

(appr. 78%) and the secondary route is via renal excretion (appr. 24%). Unchanged rimegepant was 
the major component found within faeces (42%) and urine (51%). Hence, around 32% of the initial oral 
rimegepant  dose  is  found  unchanged  in  the  faeces  and  about  12%  of  the  rimegepant  dose  is  found 
unchanged  in  the  urine.  The  absolute  BA  of  an  oral  300  mg  RGP  dose  (administered  as  2  x  150  mg 
capsules) was 64% (90% CI: 53%,77%). 
When increasing doses of rimegepant are administered, it was a consistent finding across 3 studies (117, 
CN170001, 111) that more than dose proportional increases in RGP exposure result. In Part B of Study 
CN170001  multiple  ascending  (supra)  therapeutic  doses  of  75,  150,  300,  450  and  600  mg  were 
administered once daily over a period of 14 days. More than dose proportional increases in RGP exposure 
were observed with increasing doses (estimated slope: area under the concentration-time curve during 
a dosing interval (AUCτ 1.94, Cmax 1.56). At the same time, oral clearance decreases from 297 mL/min 
for 75 mg to 37 mL/min for 600 mg once daily. The decrease in oral clearance translates into increasing 
accumulation of RGP with dose (AI: 75 mg: 1.48, 600 mg 2.25), which points to non-linear disposition 
with increasing doses. In migraine prophylaxis, RGP is proposed to be taken EOD, with a maximum daily 
dose of 75 mg, in case RGP should be used for an acute migraine attack on top of regular preventive 
treatment.  Study  CN170001  does  not  inform  about  plasma  levels  after  EOD  dosing  proposed  for 
preventive treatment. 
In  order  to  further  investigate  the  more  than  dose  proportional  increases  with  increasing  doses, 
bioavailability  (relative  to  the  75  mg  dose)  was  modelled  across  the  10-150  mg  dose  range.  PPK 
Modelling reveals the administered dose as a factor impacting on bioavailability. Mechanistic explanations 
for this finding are hypothetical. It was specified that the absolute oral BA of rimegepant is approximately 
64%. Respective absolute BA data are derived from 14C-ADME study CN170006 based on a 300 mg oral 
RGP dose as compared to IV. 
As  concerns  PK  in  the  target  population,  there  have  been  literature  reports  describing  decreased 
absorption  of  medication, if  taken  during  acute  attacks,  e.g.  zolmitriptan  (Thomsen  et  al.  1996).  The 
phenomenon  was  generally  attributed  to  gastric  stasis  during  a  migraine  attack.  In  the  case  of 
rimegepant, however, a migraine attack appeared to increase RGP exposure. In Study CN170004, the 
potential effect of an acute migraine attack on the PK profile of RPG was examined by comparing RPG 
blood levels after SD administration of 300 mg resp. 600 mg rimegepant taken within 4 hours after the 
onset of an acute attack with an inter-ictal period. For both dose levels examined (300 and 600 mg), the 
rate and extent of RGP absorption were greater during an attack as compared to the control period. The 
area under the concentration-time curve during 24 hours (AUC0-24hr) and Cmax values were 34-21% resp. 
42-21% lower during the non-migraine control period as compared to administration during an acute 
attack.  As  concerns  tmax  (mean),  results  are  not  consistent.  While  for  the  300  mg  dose  peak  RGP 
concentrations were achieved about 30 min earlier during an acute attack, it took about 35 min longer 
for the 600 mg dose. Median tmax values, however, were equal for the 600 mg dose under both conditions 
(2.0  hour).  In  essence,  although  Study  CN170004  did  not  examine  the  75  mg  RGP  dose,  it  can  be 
concluded that an acute migraine attack does not appear to negatively impact the rate and extent of 
rimegepant absorption. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Dedicated  studies  were  conducted  in  renally  and  hepatically  impaired  subjects  and  the  elderly  were 
undertaken to characterize the PK profile of rimegepant in special populations. 
In hepatic impairment study 107, a SD of 75 mg rimegepant was administered to subjects with mild, 
moderate, or severe hepatic impairment as compared to matched healthy controls. Administration of a 
single 75 mg dose of rimegepant to subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment resulted in similar 
Cmax and AUC0-inf values compared to matched controls, whereas both rate and extent of RGP absorption 
in  subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  were  elevated  approximately  2-fold.  The  applicant’s 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 50/135

conclusion is endorsed that in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment no dose adaption is 
required. For subjects with severe hepatic impairment, however, it is specified in the SmPC that the use 
of rimegepant should be avoided.  
ADME-Study  CN170006  revealed  that  the  primary  route  of  elimination  is  through  the  faeces,  with 
approximately 78% of the radioactivity from a [14C]-rimegepant dose recovered in the faeces compared 
to only 24% recovered in the urine. Accordingly, administration of a single 75 mg dose of rimegepant to 
subjects  with  mild,  moderate,  or  severe  resulted  in  largely  similar  Cmax  and  AUC  values  compared  to 
normal  healthy  matched  controls.  However,  there  are  some  inconsistencies  in  observed  changes  of 
rimegepant  availability  relative  to  the  various  degrees  of  renal  impairment.  While  AUC  values  were 
almost unchanged in subjects with mild (AUC ratio 106%) resp. severe (AUC ratio 104%) RI as compared 
to controls, a 40% increase in AUC was observed in subjects with moderately impaired renal function. 
Also, Cmax values do not change consistently to the degree of RI. While Cmax values increased by 20% in 
mild RI, Cmax was decreased by about 10% in severely impaired subjects. Since there is no other plausible 
clinical explanation, these inconsistencies may be due to the low number of subjects included in study 
106  (n=6  per  renal  impairment  level).  Importantly,  in  renally  impaired  subjects  no  delay  in  tmax was 
observed. Overall, it is concluded that changes in RGP availability as function of RI do not require dose 
adaptions of rimegepant. The minor impact of renal function on rimegepant’s PK is consistent with the 
expectation of renal clearance as a secondary elimination mechanism to overall elimination. The results 
of study 106 are adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
The  effect  of  age  was  examined  in  study  108  comparing  the  exposure  of  rimegepant  after  SD 
administration of a 75 mg tablet in healthy elderly (aged > 65 years) with non-elderly (> 18 and < 45 
years  of  age)  subjects  following  a  parallel  group  design.  Bioequivalence  between  the  two  age  groups 
could not be shown, however, the ratio (elderly/non-elderly) resp. associated 90% CIs did not point to 
a statistically significant differences between the elderly and non-elderly subjects (AUC0-t: 104.5 [81.40, 
134.19], Cmax: 96.6 [70.71, 131.83]). The increased extent of exposure in terms of AUC goes along with 
a statistically prolonged t1/2 value (increase of 4.9 hour) in elderly subjects. In pivotal phase III studies 
no upper age limit was defined for study participation. The applicant’s conclusion that no dose adjustment 
is required in the elderly subpopulation is acceptable. 
Pharmacokinetic Interactions 
The  PK  interaction  potential  of  rimegepant  was  thoroughly  characterised  by  a  number  of  in  vivo  DDI 
studies. 
The prevalence of migraine peaks in women of childbearing potential, hence, any potential IA with oral 
contraceptives  is  of  critical  importance.  DDI  Study  CN170002  was  conducted  early  during  clinical 
development and examined the impact of supra-therapeutic rimegepant doses (600 mg, 450 mg o.d.) 
on plasma levels of once daily oral contraceptive (norgestimate [NGM], 250 ng; ethinyl estradiol [EE], 
35 ng, Ortho Cyclen™). Clinically relevant increases of hormone concentrations were observed. The EE 
estrogen component increased by 70% (Cmax) resp. 78% (AUCτ). An even greater increase in systemic 
exposure was observed for NGMN, an active metabolite of NGM (Cmax increased by 87%, AUCτ increased 
2.3-fold relative to control).  
Given  the  magnitude  of  effect,  further  insight  was  required  from  subsequent IA  study  BHV3000-101, 
where  the  same  oral  contraceptive  was  combined  with  single  resp.  multiple  therapeutic  75  mg 
rimegepant doses. Co-administration of a single 75 mg dose of RGP with Ortho-Cyclen™ did not have 
any  clinically  relevant  effects  on  estrogen  resp.  gestagen  levels.  However,  co-administration  of  8 
consecutive 75 mg daily doses of RPG with Ortho-Cyclen™ (0.250 mg NGM, 0.035 mg EE) resulted in a 
significant increase in the exposure of EE (1.2- to 1.3-fold increase in AUC and Cmax) and NGMN (1.4- to 
1.5-fold increase in AUC and Cmax). Hence, the increasing effect on estrogen / gestagen levels was less 
pronounced than observed in preceding IA study CN170002 (when supra-therapeutic rimegepant doses 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 51/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
were  tested).  The  observed  increases  in  AUC  and  Cmax  of  the  estrogen  and  gestagen  components  of 
combined oral contraceptives fulfil the criteria for weak enzyme inhibition by rimegepant according to 
the EMA Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions. Hence, no particular labelling is required. 
Non-clinical in vitro studies revealed that rimegepant is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser 
extent by CYP2C9. Study CN170007 was conducted to evaluate the impact of single and multiple doses 
of rimegepant on the PK of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, midazolam. Both single dose (300 mg) and 
multiple once daily doses (150 mg) of rimegepant significantly increased exposure of co-administered 
CYP3A4  substrate  midazolam  (2  mg).  However,  even  after  administration  of  supra-therapeutic 
rimegepant  doses,  AUC  and  Cmax  values  of  of  co-administered  CYP3A4  substrate  midazolam  (2  mg) 
increased by (only) 86-91% and 38-53%. Hence, the criteria for weak enzyme inhibition according to 
the EMA Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions are fulfilled. In section 5.2 of the proposed 
SmPC rimegepant is identified as a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 with time-dependent inhibition. 
In  vivo  DDI  Study  103  further  identifies  rimegepant  as  a  substrate  of  CYP3A4  metabolism.  If  co-
administered with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole, the extent of rimegepant exposure increases 
by  more  than  4-fold.  SmPC  sections  4.4  and  4.5  specify  that  rimegepant  is  not  recommended  for 
concomitant use with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. 
The  inverse  effect  was  observed  in  Study  104,  examining  DDI  between  therapeutic  75  mg  doses  of 
rimegepant and the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin (600 mg o.d. over 11 consecutive days). Exposure 
of rimegepant was decreased to a degree, which may lead to a loss of efficacy (AUC reduced by 81%, 
and  Cmax  by  64%).  Therefore,  SmPC  sections  4.4  and  4.5  do  not  recommend  the  concomitant use of 
rimegepant with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. 
The contribution of CYP2C9 to rimegepant’s metabolism was further characterised in Study 105, which 
examined the impact of fluconazole, a strong CYP2C9 and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, on rimegepant 
PK. Administration of a single 75 mg dose of rimegepant concurrent with steady state fluconazole (400 
mg  QD)  increased  rimegepant  AUC  by  approximately  1.8-fold.  An  effect  on  RPG’s  peak  plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) was not observed. Fluconazole is a strong inhibitor of  CYP2C9, and a moderate 
inhibitor of CYP3A4. Non-clinical in vitro studies indicated that rimegepant is predominantly metabolised 
by  CYP3A4,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  by  CYP2C9.  The  relative  contribution  of  either  CYP2C9  or  CYP3A4 
inhibition to the 80% increase in AUC, if rimegepant is co-administered with fluconazole, is therefore not 
evident.  SmPC  section  4.5  specifies  that  only  one  rimegepant  dose  should  be  administered  within  48 
hours, if co-administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
Available in vitro data revealed that rimegepant has the potential to inhibit human MATE1 and OCT2, 
with  a  more  potent  inhibition  of  MATE1  than  OCT2.  Interaction  Study  119  examined  the  PK  and  PD 
interaction between regular administration of the antidiabetic metformin (2 x 500 mg/d) with once daily 
rimegepant 75 mg tablets. Metformin is a known substrate of renal cationic transporter systems. This 
suggested the potential for an interaction between rimegepant and metformin to occur in the kidney, 
where inhibition of MATE1 by rimegepant would cause an increase in plasma metformin concentrations 
and  a  decrease  in  metformin  clearance  in  urine.  In  vivo  data  confirmed  preliminary  theoretical 
considerations. Co-administered rimegepant increased steady state AUC0τ values of metformin by 16%. 
The  increase  in  metformin  exposure  goes  along  with  an  approx.  10%  decrease  of  metformin’s  renal 
clearance. These pharmacokinetic interactions, however, did not translate into inhibition of metformin’s 
antidiabetic activity. The oral glucose tolerance in healthy adult subjects was almost unaffected by co-
administered  rimegepant  as  compared  to  regular  metformin  administration  alone.  The  issue  is 
adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
Rimegepant has also been shown to be a substrate of P-gp and BCRP efflux transporters in vitro. Study 
122 was designed to assess the effect of cyclosporine (strong nonselective inhibitor of P-gp, and BCRP) 
on the PK of rimegepant 75 mg in healthy subjects (Part I). Dependent on the results obtained in Part I,

the effect of a specific, strong P-gp inhibitor quinidine on rimegepant PK was planned to be analysed in 
Part II.  
The strong nonselective P-gp and BCRP transporter inhibitor cyclosporine increased rimegepant AUC and 
Cmax by 1.62-fold, resp. by 1.44-fold, suggesting an increased rate and extent of rimegepant absorption 
through the inhibition of intestinal efflux transporters (P-gp and/or BCRP). Given the magnitude of effect 
observed in Part I, it was required to further elucidate the relative contribution of the P-gp resp. BCRP 
transporter inhibition to the observed increase in rimegepant exposure.  
In Part II of Study 122, the strong selective P-gp transporter inhibitor quinidine (2 x 300 mg) was co-
administered with rimegepant (75 mg). A higher rate and extent of rimegepant absorption was observed 
suggesting  inhibition  of  P-gp  by  quinidine  at  the  intestinal  level.  The  similarity  in  magnitude  of  the 
quinidine  (selectively  inhibits  P-gp)  results  with  those  of  cyclosporine  (inhibits  both  P-gp  and  BCRP) 
indicates  that  the  effects  of  BCRP  inhibition  on  rimegepant  exposure  may  be  inconsequential. 
Additionally, unlike cyclosporine, quinidine has not shown in vivo inhibition of either CYP3A or CYP2C9, 
further demonstrating that the increase in rimegepant exposures by both cyclosporine and quinidine is 
primarily  due  to  inhibition  of  P-gp.  Overall,  strong  P-gp  inhibitors  such  as  cyclosporine  and  quinidine 
have the potential to increase the exposure of rimegepant by > 50% but <2-fold. The applicant specifies 
in the SmPC that strong P-gp inhibitors may be co- administered with rimegepant no more frequently 
than once every 48 hours. 
Taken  together,  a  number  of  clinically  relevant  interactions  were  explored.  These  mainly  relate  to 
changes  in  rimegepant  exposure  if  co-administered  with  strong  or  moderate  inhibitors  /  inducers  of 
CYP3A4  metabolizing  enzymes,  but  also  to  concomitant  administration  with  strong  P-gp  transporter 
inhibitors. The pH-related IA with acid-modifying agents did not lead to rimegepant’s loss of efficacy, as 
shown be retrospective subgroup analysis of phase 3 data. Hence, co-administration with antacids and 
rimegepant does not need to be explicitly discouraged in the label. 
TQTc Study 
The submitted thorough QTc study appears well conducted. Moxifloxacin was included as positive control 
and yielded the expected results (QTc prolongation by 5 to 10 ms). This demonstrates an appropriate 
sensitivity of the study. Neither visual inspection of the results nor formal statistical analysis gave any 
hint  that  rimegepant  could  prolong  the  QT  interval  in  a  relevant  way.  However,  a  gender-related 
evaluation  is  currently  missing.  As  most  of  the  migraine  patients  are  females,  subgroup  analysis  by 
gender (ΔQTcF and ΔΔQTcF estimates incl. 90% CI per time-point) should be presented. 
Dose ranging and PK/PD 
Dose ranging phase 2b study CN170003 examined a dose range of 10 mg to 600 mg rimegepant single 
doses and demonstrated efficacy for the 75 mg dose in acute treatment of migraine attacks. Lower doses 
(10 mg, 25 mg) did not separate from placebo. Higher than 75 mg doses (150 mg, 300 mg) did not lead 
to clinically relevant increased benefit as compared to the 75 mg dose.  
Analysis of PK-PD data published for competitor CGRP antagonists, approved for migraine prevention, 
suggested that clinical activity is connected to a > 90% inhibition of CGRP signalling. A target Cmax of 
750 nM (400 ng/mL) for efficacious migraine therapy with rimegepant was derived from PD testing in 
primates (marmosets) using the CGRP-induced dermal blood flow assay.  
Based on efficacy data obtained from pivotal trials in acute migraine (studies 301/302/303), it was shown 
that the beneficial effect of rimegepant is maintained for up to 48 hours post-administration. This finding 
lead to the rationale of testing rimegepant in subsequent migraine prevention trial 305 following an EOD 
dosing  schedule.  PK-PD  modelling  data  from  a  primate  pharmacodynamic  assay  and  human  PK  data 
demonstrated that rimegepant 75 mg single dose and the EOD dosing regimen both achieved the PD 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 53/135

target of ≥ 90% CGRP inhibition established for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. The 
aim was to provide both effective therapy (with periods of maximal CGRP inhibition ≥ 90%) and support 
safety/tolerability  with  repeated  use  (by  planned  regular  excursions  into  periods  of  lower  CGRP 
inhibition). 
In  summary,  it  is  concluded  that  classical  dose  finding  data  obtained  in  acute  treatment  of  migraine 
attacks (study CN170003) substantiate the use of the 75 mg rimegepant in pivotal trials for abortive 
migraine treatment (301/302/303). The rationale for the use of 75 mg rimegepant doses to be taken 
every other day in migraine prevention is based on PK/PD modelling on one side, and on the other side, 
on the observation from acute RCTs that the beneficial effect of rimegepant in acute attacks is maintained 
over 48 hours post-administration. The latter aspect illustrates the difference in the migraine prevention 
approach  between  rimegepant  and  available  per  oral  migraine  preventive  agents  like  ß-blockers, 
topiramate and others. For these, efficacy in acute migraine attacks is not established and administered 
doses in migraine prevention are similar to the doses administered for their primary field of clinical use 
(hypertension, epilepsy etc.). In the case of rimegepant, however, the same dose is applied in abortive 
and preventive treatment, only the dosing interval was adapted for prevention, based on the period for 
which beneficial effects were demonstrated in acute trials.  
Irrespective  of  PK-PD  modelling,  the  adequacy  of  the  75  mg  dose  of  rimegepant  to  be  taken  EOD  in 
migraine prevention is to be assessed based on randomised, placebo-controlled data provided from study 
305. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Taken  together,  it  is  concluded  that  a  comprehensive  PK  data  package  was  provided.  The  PK  of 
rimegepant in special populations was adequately characterised. The rationale for EOD dosing of 75 mg 
rimegepant  to  achieve  a  90%  inhibition  of  CGRP  signalling  in  migraine  prevention  was  based  on 
nonclinical testing in marmosets, published data for other CGRP antagonists, and PK/PD modelling.  
There are principle differences in the way migraine “prophylaxis” is achieved between rimegepant and 
other orally administered preventive agents, like ß-blockers, topiramate, antidepressants or others.  
2.7.  Clinical efficacy 
2.7.1.  Dose response study 
Dose ranging has been established on the basis of study CN170003 described in section above.  
2.7.2.  Main study(ies) 
The rimegepant marketing authorisation application (MAA) dossier includes efficacy data from 4 pivotal 
studies for the treatment of migraine conducted in the US (three pivotal Phase 3 studies for the acute 
treatment  of  migraine  [BHV3000-303  with  ODT;  BHV3000-301  and  BHV3000-302  with  tablet],  and  a 
pivotal Phase 2/3 study for migraine prophylaxis [BHV3000-305 with tablet]). Supportive studies include 
a Phase 2/3, open-label, long-term safety study where subjects could receive rimegepant 75 mg doses 
for up to 52 weeks, including nearly 300 subjects who received scheduled dosing with rimegepant 75 
mg EOD as well as needed (PRN) up to once per calendar day for up to 12 weeks (BHV3000-201 with 
tablet). 
Treatment of acute single attack studies 301/302/303 
The  3  pivotal  acute  treatment  studies  had  similar  study  designs  and  requirements:  Study  303  was  a 
phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, outpatient evaluation of the safety

and efficacy of a single dose of rimegepant 75 mg ODT compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine 
with moderate or severe pain intensity. 
Participants  were  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  and  dispensed  1  dose  of  study  medication  consisting  of 
rimegepant 75 mg ODT or matching placebo. The total duration of the study was up to 11 weeks. This 
included a 3- to 28-day screening period; an acute treatment phase that could last up to 45 days, during 
which the subject could treat one migraine that reached moderate or severe pain intensity; and an end-
of-treatment (EOT) visit within 7 days after the administration of the study medication. The overall study 
design, eligibility, and requirements of studies 302 and 301 were identical, apart from the fact that the 
tablet study drug formulation was used instead of the ODT tablet for studies 301 and 302.

Migraine prevention study 305 
BHV3000-305 was a multi-centre study to assess the safety and efficacy of rimegepant 75 mg in migraine 
prophylaxis.  The  study  consists  of  4  phases:  a  28-day  screening  phase,  a  12-week  double-blind 
treatment (DBT) phase, a 52-week open-label extension (OLE) phase, and an 8-week follow-up safety 
phase. 
Screening Phase 
The  screening  phase  included  a  Screening  visit  and  a  28-day  observation  period  (OP).  The  subject’s 
migraine  history  and  medical  history  were  collected  at  the  Screening  visit.  Upon  completion  of  the 
Screening visit, subjects were provided an electronic diary (eDiary) to document each day of the 28-day 
OP if a migraine occurred and the migraine intensity and characteristics. Subjects recorded the standard 
of  care  migraine  treatment  received  on  a  paper  diary  and  female  subjects  recorded  their  menstrual 
period information on a paper log. 
Double-blind Treatment Phase 
After completing the 28-day OP, subjects returned to the clinic for the baseline visit, during which their 
eligibility for continued participation in the study was assessed. If eligible, subjects were randomised and 
entered  the  12-week  DBT  phase  (Weeks  1  through  12),  during  which  they  were  instructed  to  take  1 
tablet of blinded study drug (rimegepant 75 mg or placebo) EOD. If subjects had a migraine during the

DBT phase of the study, if needed, they could treat the migraine with their standard of care medication 
and were instructed to continue to take study medication on their regular schedule (scheduled dosing 
days only). 
Open-label Extension Phase 
At the completion of the 12-week DBT phase, subjects could enter into the 52-week OLE phase (Weeks 
13 through 64) if they continued to meet study entry criteria and laboratory test results were acceptable 
per protocol. During the OLE phase, subjects were instructed to take 1 tablet of rimegepant 75 mg EOD. 
If subjects had a migraine on a day that they were not scheduled to dose with rimegepant, they could 
take 1 tablet of rimegepant 75 mg on that calendar day to treat a migraine. Therefore, during the OLE 
phase, subjects could take a maximum of 1 rimegepant 75 mg tablet per calendar day for this 52-week 
period. 
Follow-up Safety Phase 
After completing the OLE phase, subjects were to return to the clinic for an EOT visit. There were follow-
up safety visits 2 and 8 weeks after the EOT visit for assessment of liver function tests (LFTs). Subjects 
who did not complete the DBT phase and/or did not enter or complete the OLE phase were to complete 
the EOT visit, the 2-week follow-up safety visit, and the 8-week follow-up safety visit after their early 
discontinuation

Treatments 
Rescue Mx (Single attack studies 301/302/303) 
In  single  attack  studies  301/302/303,  rescue  medication  is  prohibited  until  the  2-hour  post-dose 
assessment for the primary endpoint. Thereafter, the subject is allowed to take unspecific analgesics or 
antiemetics for rescue, if pain relief was not achieved or pain recurs. The efficacy assessment time spans 
over  48  hours  post-dose  to  record  sustained  pain  relief  from  2-48  hours  post-dose.  Thereafter,  the 
subject is allowed to also administer triptans as individual rescue, if not contraindicated. Once rescue Mx 
was taken, any subsequent efficacy assessment is classified as failure. 
Rescue MX: Prevention study 305 
During the 12-week DBT period rimegepant is to be taken EOD for prevention, but is prohibited to be 
taken as rescue in case an acute attack occurs. During the DBT period subjects may take their usual 
rescue medication for acute attacks, incl. triptans. During the subsequent OLE phase, however, triptans 
are prohibited. Instead, subjects are allowed to take 1 rimegepant dose for an acute attack (on top of 
regular EOD dosing) on days for which rimegepant EOD for prevention is not scheduled, i.e. taken acute 
and preventive rimegepant together, a MDD of 1 dose per day (75 mg) is to be observed. 
Prohibited Concomitant Medication (Single attack studies 301/302/303) 
The below medications are prohibited prior to randomisation and during the course of this study. 
•  St. John’s Wort, Butterbur root or extracts 
•  Barbiturate-containing products  
•  Modafinil (PROVIGIL®) 
•  History of use of ergotamine medications on greater than/equal 10 days per month on a regular 
basis for greater than/equal 3 months. 
•  History of non-narcotic analgesic intake on greater than/equal 15 days per month for greater 
than/equal  3  month  (e.g.  acetaminophen,  NSAIDs,  gabapentin  etc.)  for  other  pain 
indications.

•  Use  of  narcotic  medication,  such  as  opioids  (e.g.  morphine,  codeine,  oxycodone  and 
hydrocodone) for at least 2 days prior to randomisation. 
•  Use of all acetaminophen or acetaminophen containing products must be discontinued at least 2 
days prior to randomisation (acetaminophen < 1000mg/day is allowed as rescue). During the 
screening  phase  (3-28  days)  use  of  acetaminophen  or  acetaminophen  containing  products  at 
daily dosing levels of greater than 1000mg/day is prohibited. 
•  Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers with rimegepant 
Subjects on prophylactic migraine medication are permitted to remain on therapy provided they have 
been on a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to study entry. Low dose aspirin (e.g. 81 mg or less) 
for documentedcardiovascular prophylaxis is allowed. 
Prohibited Concomitant Medication (Prevention study 305) 
(where divergent from studies 301/302/303) 
triptans are prohibited during the OLE phase 
• 
•  CGRP  antagonists  (biologic  [e.g.  Aimovig™  and  Ajovy™]  or  small  molecule)  other  than 
rimegepant 
•  Concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers 
•  Concomitant use of atypical antipsychotics or Depakote/Depakene (valproic acid/valproate) 
•  Concomitant use of LAMICTAL (lamotrigine) 
•  Use of analgesics (e.g. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or acetaminophen) on ≥ 
15 days per month is prohibited during the study. 
Prophylactic Medications (Prevention 305) 
Throughout  preventive  trial  305,  subjects  were  allowed  to  continue  1  (but  not  2)  of  their  usual 
prophylactic medications, if administered in stable doses within 3 months (12 weeks) prior to the start 
of the OP and throughout the study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of SD studies 301/302/303 was to evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant 75-mg ODT 
(or  tablet)  compared  to  placebo  in  the  acute  treatment  of  migraine  as  measured  by  the  co-primary 
endpoints freedom from pain and from the most bothersome symptom (MBS) associated with migraine 
at 2 hours post-dose. 
The  primary  objective  of  prevention  study  305  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  rimegepant  75  mg  to 
placebo as a preventive treatment for migraine, as measured by the reduction from baseline (i.e., the 
4-week OP) in the mean number of MDs per month in the last 4 weeks of the 12-week DBT phase. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Single attack studies 301/302/303 
Single attack studies 301/302/303 had 2 co-primary endpoints: 
• 
Freedom from Pain at 2 Hours Post-dose 
Freedom  from  pain  was  assessed  using  the  number  of  modified  intention-to-treat  (mITT) 
subjects that reported pain levels of “none” at 2 hours post-dose on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = 
none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). 
• 
Freedom from MBS at 2 Hours Post-dose 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 59/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
Freedom from each subject’s MBS was assessed using the number of mITT subjects who reported 
that their MBS (reported prior to dosing) was absent at 2 hours post-dose. The symptoms that 
could have been nominated as the MBS (phonophobia, photophobia, or nausea) were measured 
using a binary scale (0 = absent, 1 = present). 
A number of secondary endpoints were defined. These were hierarchically arranged. The order of 
hierarchy differs between most recent study 303 (conducted with ODT) and previous single attack 
studies 301/302 (conducted with tablets). The secondary endpoints in 302/301 are a subset of the 
secondary endpoints in study 303.  
Relevant secondary endpoints include pain relief at 2 hours post-dose, sustained pain relief from 2 to 24 
hours,  sustained  pain  freedom  from  2  to  24,  resp.  from  2  to  48  hours  post-dose,  freedom  from 
photophobia / phonophobia / nausea, and others. 
Prevention study 305 
The primary efficacy endpoint of study 305 was the change from the OP in the mean number of MDs per 
month in the last month (Weeks 9 to 12) of the DBT phase. 
There were six secondary efficacy endpoints in this study (hierarchically arranged), which were evaluated 
in the following manner: 
1.  Percentage of subjects who have a ≥ 50% reduction from OP in the mean number of moderate 
or  severe  MDs  per  month  on  treatment  in  the  last  month  of  the  DBT  phase.  Evaluable  mITT 
subjects  with  ≥  50%  reductions  were  compared  between  treatment  groups  using  a  CMH  test, 
stratified by prophylactic migraine medication use at randomisation (yes, no). 
2.  Change from baseline in the mean number of MDs per month over the entire DBT phase (Weeks 
1 to 12) 
3.  Mean number of rescue medication days per month on treatment in the last month of the DBT 
phase 
4.  Change from OP in the mean number of MDs per month on treatment in the first month (Weeks 
1 to 4) of the DBT phase 
5.  Change  from  baseline  in  the  Migraine  Specific  Quality  of  Life  Questionnaire  restrictive  role 
function domain score at Week 12 in the DBT phase 
6.  Change from baseline in the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) total score at Week 12 in 
the DBT phase

A migraine day is defined as any calendar day that the subject experiences a qualified migraine headache 
(onset, continuation, or recurrence of the migraine headache). A qualified migraine headache is defined 
as a migraine with or without aura, lasting for ≥ 30 minutes, and meeting at least one of the following 
criteria (A and/or B): 
A) At least two of the following pain features: 
•  Unilateral location 
• 
Pulsating quality (throbbing) 
•  Moderate or severe pain intensity 
•  Aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (e.g., walking or climbing stairs) 
B) At least 1 of the following associated symptoms: 
•  Nausea and/or vomiting 
• 
Photophobia and phonophobia

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Single attack studies 301/302/303 
After completion of all screening evaluations, all eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 
rimegepant or placebo treatment groups. The randomisation was stratified by the use of prophylactic 
migraine medications (yes or no). 
Prevention study 305 
At the baseline visit for the DBT phase, eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the rimegepant 
or  placebo  treatment  groups.  The  randomisation  was  stratified  by  the  use  of  prophylactic  migraine 
medications (yes or no). 
Blinding was critical to the integrity of clinical studies. However, in the event of a medical emergency or 
pregnancy in an individual subject, the blind for that subject could be broken by the treating physician. 
Statistical methods 
Studies 301/302/302 
Efficacy evaluations were based on mITT subjects: randomised subjects who were randomised only once, 
took study medication, had a baseline migraine of moderate to severe pain intensity and who provided 
at least 1 post-baseline efficacy data point.  
Rimegepant was tested for superiority to placebo, at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, on both co-primary 
endpoints of freedom from pain at 2 hours postdose and freedom from MBS at 2 hours postdose. Both 
endpoints  were  evaluated  using  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  tests  stratified  by  the  use  of  prophylactic 
migraine  medication  (yes  or  no).  The  population  summary,  the  between  group  difference  in  the 
percentage  of  pain  free  subjects,  is  assessed  by  computing  the  “risk  difference”  between  treatment 
groups.  
Secondary endpoints are analysed using the same methods as for the co-primary endpoints. Type I error 
was controlled in this study by using a hierarchical gate-keeping procedure.  
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the influence of missing data.  
Study 305 
Efficacy evaluation were based on evaluable mITT subjects: subjects with ≥ 14 days of eDiary efficacy 
data (not necessarily consecutive) in both the OP and at least one month (i.e., 4-week interval) in the 
DBT phase. 
The principal analysis of the primary endpoint (change from the OP in the mean number of MDs per 
month in the last month (Weeks 9 to 12) of the DBT phase) used a generalised linear mixed effect model 
(GLMEM) with the following variables: change from the OP in number of total MDs per month as the 
dependent variable; subject as a random effect; number of total MDs per month in the OP as a covariate; 
treatment group, prophylactic migraine medication use at randomisation, month (i.e., months 1 to 3 of 
the  DBT  phase),  and  the  month-by-treatment  group  interaction  as  fixed  effects.  MDs  per  month  are 
based on data from the previous visit to the current visit (i.e., 4-week interval), and were prorated to 
account for missing migraine reports. 
A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint used the same GLMEM as the principal analysis, but with 
jump to reference to impute missing data in months 1 to 3. 
There were 6 secondary efficacy endpoints in this study. Type 1 error was controlled through the use of 
hierarchical  testing.  The  significance  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  evaluated  at  the  0.05  level.  If  the 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 61/135

Results 
Participant flow 
Studies 301/302/303 
Study completion was high across the 3 single attack studies 301/302/303 and dose arms (around 99% 
for  rimegepant  75  mg  and  placebo).  Subjects  were  given  a  45-day  period  to  treat  1  acute  migraine 
attack. A migraine attack of moderate to severe intensity was not experienced in only very isolated cases 
during that time. 
Table 26: Subject Disposition - Treated Subjects in Single-Dose Studies with Rimegepant 75 
mg and Placebo - Phase 3 Studies BHV3000-301/302/303 
Prophylaxis Study 305 
Overall, 747 subjects were randomised, and 741 subjects were treated with rimegepant (370 subjects) 
or placebo (371 subjects) in the DBT phase. The reasons that 6 subjects were randomised but not treated 
were due to protocol deviations (2 rimegepant subjects and 2 placebo subjects) and lost to follow-up (1 
rimegepant subject and 1 placebo subject). 
There  are no ongoing  subjects  in  the  DBT  phase.  The  majority of  treated  subjects  (626/741,  84.5%) 
completed the DBT phase. The most common reasons for the 115 treated subjects not completing the 
DBT phase were withdrawal by subject (11 rimegepant subjects and 22 placebo subjects), lost to follow-
up (19 rimegepant subjects and 12 placebo subjects), and eligibility failure due to baseline laboratory 
values (8 rimegepant subjects and 13 placebo subjects).

Baseline data 
Demographics – Single attack studies 301/302/303 
In mITT subjects, the median age ranged from 38.9 to 41.5 years across treatment groups. Most subjects 
were  female  (84.9%  to  89.2%  across  treatment  groups)  and  white  (73.4%  to  82.1%).  About  1%  of 
subjects in all treatment groups had a CV risk contraindicating triptan use (range 0.4% to 1.2%). Almost 
half  of  the  subjects  (range  41.4%  to  52.7%  across  treatment  groups)  had  a  BMI  ≥  30  kg/m2.  Aura 
symptoms  were  experienced  by  about  one  third  of  patients.  About  14-17%  of  all  subjects  used 
concomitant non-study prophylactic migraine medication.

Table 28: Demographic and Baseline Characteristics – mITT Subjects in BHV3000-301, 
BHV3000-302, and BHV3000-303 
At screening, about one third of subjects was currently using triptans for the treatment of acute attacks. 
Triptans were prohibited as rescue in single attack studies 301/302/303 until the subject had completed 
all e-diary entries at 48 hours post-dose.  
In terms of migraine history, mITT treatment groups both within and across studies were well balanced. 
The  median number  of  moderate  or  severe  pain  intensity  migraine  attacks  per  month  was  4.0  for  all 
treatment groups. Across treatment groups, most subject’s primary migraine type was migraine without 
aura (range 65.0% to 71.7%), and their MBS was photophobia (range 55.1% to 58.9%). The median 
onset of migraine was at about 19 years of age. Given the mean age of 40 years of included subjects, 
the mean duration of migraine history is about 20 years at study entry.

Of the 741 subjects treated in this study, 15 (2.0%) had been previously treated in one of the single-
dose rimegepant acute treatment studies (BHV3000-301, BHV3000-302, or BHV3000-303): 2 subjects 
were from BHV3000-301 and 13 subjects were from BHV3000-303. 
The median age was 40.0 years, the majority of subjects were female (83.0%), and most subjects were 
white  (81.2%).  With  respect  to  their  migraine  disease  history,  evaluable  mITT  subjects  of  study  305 
presented with a disease history of about 20 years (mean age about 40 years, age of onset about 18 
years). The median number of moderate to severe migraine attacks per month was 8.0 (range: 4 to 18), 
and the median average duration of untreated migraine attacks was 24.0 hours. The typically MBS was 
photophobia  (57.1%)  and  the  primary  migraine  type  was  migraine  without  aura  (60.1%).  Of  the 
evaluable subjects, 22.7% reported history of CM.

Numbers analysed 
In  the  3  pivotal  acute  treatment  studies  303,  302,  and  301,  1.771  subjects  were  treated  with  the 
proposed  single  rimegepant  dose  of  75  mg  and  1.782  were  treated  with  placebo.  Of  these,  1.749 
rimegepant subjects and 1.758 placebo subjects were evaluable for efficacy (i.e., were mITT subjects).

Of the 747 randomised subjects in study 305 (6 of these were randomised twice), 695 were included in 
the evaluable mITT population. Reasons for exclusion from the evaluable mITT population include < 14 
days of efficacy data in all 3 months in DBT phase (46 subjects) and not treated with DBT (6 subjects). 
Most (624/695; 89.8%) of evaluable mITT subjects completed the DBT phase.

Outcomes and estimation

Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
Significant efficacy  was  demonstrated on both of  the  co-primary  endpoints of  freedom  from pain  and 
freedom from MBS at 2 hours post-dose across the 3 single attack studies.

Studies BHV3000-303, BHV3000-302, and BHV3000-301 with Rimegepant 75 mg and 
Placebo 
Freedom from associated symptoms 
The endpoint freedom from photophobia reflects complete relief of photophobia at 2 hours post-dose, 
irrespective of its categorisation as most bothersome relative to other associated symptoms that might 
have also been present. Across treatment arms, photophobia was reported to be present by 86-91% of 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 66/135

subjects.  Phonophobia  was  reported  to  be  present  at  the  onset  of  a  migraine  attack  by  63-70%  of 
subjects.  Consistent  superiority  over  placebo  could  be  shown  for  freedom  of  photophobia  and 
phonophobia at 2 hours post-dose across the 3 single attack studies. 
Nausea is the least common of the cardinal associated symptoms of migraine and, as a result, power for 
detecting differences in nausea freedom in individual clinical trials is relatively low. Results from the 3 
pivotal studies show a consistent advantage of rimegepant over placebo, with the therapeutic gains in 
those studies ranging from 4.76% to 5.87%. Since nausea is only analysed in subjects that present with 
that symptom at the start of the treated migraine, the sample size is limited to roughly 60% of the mITT 
population. Hence, tests on nausea were underpowered in the individual pivotal studies. After statistical 
significance could not be shown for freedom from nausea at 2 post-dose, all endpoints listed afterwards 
in the hierarchy were not considered statistically significant in either study.

Primary efficacy endpoint 
Subjects are instructed to report headache status (yes, no), severity (mild, moderate, severe, none), 
and  characteristics  (e.g.,  aura,  nausea,  vomiting),  as  well  as  medication  taken  to  treat  headache  or 
during aura, in the eDiary evening report headache log or follow-up headache log recorded every day in 
the OP, DBT, and OLE phases.

Migraine days per month will be assessed as “migraine days per 4 weeks” to correspond with the 4-week 
visit schedule. Migraine days per month are based on data from the previous visit to the current visit 
(i.e., 4-week interval), and are prorated to account for missing migraine reports. 
The number of migraine days per month in the DBT phase will be examined relative to the number of 
migraine days per month in the OP for evaluable mITT subjects, i.e., subjects with > 14 days of eDiary 
efficacy data (not necessarily consecutive) in both the OP analysis period and > 1 month (i.e., 4-week 
interval) in the on-DBT analysis period. 
Rimegepant at a dose of 75 mg EOD demonstrated superiority to placebo on the primary endpoint of 
change from the OP in the mean number of migraine days per month on treatment in the last month 
(Weeks 9 to 12) of the DBT phase in evaluable mITT subjects. The difference (therapeutic gain) between 
treatment groups (i.e., rimegepant – placebo) was -0.8 days (- 4.3 days for rimegepant and – 3.5 days 
for placebo; p = 0.0099) (principal analysis using GLMEM).

If the sensitivity analysis applying GLMEM but with Jump-to-Reference to impute missing data, the net 
difference  between  rimegepant  and  placebo  in  evaluable  mITT  subjects  in  terms  of  MD  reduction 
throughout the last 4 weeks (wk 9-12) of the DBT is diminished to -0.7 MDs (p=0.0400), as compared 
to the primary GLMEM analysis yielding a net difference of -0.8 MDs (p=0.0099).

Table 36: Total Migraine Days per Month Changes from the Observation Period Over Time on 
Double-Blind Treatment Estimated Using GLMEM: Sensitivity Analysis (Jump to Reference), 
Evaluable mITT Subjects, Study 305 
During  the  OP  subjects  experienced  10.3  (rimegepant)  resp.  9.9  (placebo)  MDs.  In  both  arms,  the 
number of MDs per 28-day assessment period decreases constantly per month throughout the 12-week 
DBT period. In terms of percent reduction, the number of MDs was reduced by -50.3% in rimegepant 
subjects,  while  placebo  subjects  achieved  to  reduce  the  mean  number  of  MDs  from  week  9-12  by  -
41.7%. The overall net difference of -0.7 MDs per month between rimegepant and placebo corresponds 
to less than 10% of the number of MDs experienced at baseline. 
The applicant specified that subjects must have > 14 days of efficacy data (not necessarily consecutive) 
in the specified month to be counted as mITT evaluable. The portion of subjects not considered mITT

intervals) was about equally distributed across arms (rimegepant 5.9%, placebo 6.5%).

Total Migraine Days over time 
Consistent with the primary analysis demonstrating the efficacy of rimegepant during the last month of 
the  DBT  phase,  rimegepant  also  displayed  statistically  significant  superiority  over  placebo  on  the 
reduction in MDs per month over the entire 12-week DBT phase (- 3.6 days for rimegepant and – 2.7 
days for placebo; p = 0.0017).

Use of rescue 
Throughout the 12-week DBT period, subjects could use their individual rescue medication (incl. triptans, 
NSAIDs, antiemetics) in case an acute migraine attack occurred despite preventive study medication. 
Across arms and the three 28-day treatment intervals of the DBT, subjects used rescue on a mean of 
about 4-5 days per month. Rimegepant did not significantly separate from placebo in any of the three 
28-day intervals of the DBT in terms of rescue medication use.

50% Reduction in MDs Responder analysis 
A responder analysis was conducted to examine the portion of subjects achieving a 50% reduction in 
monthly MDs. It could be shown that 49.1% of rimegepant subjects achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in the 
mean number of moderate or severe MDs per month in the last month of the DBT phase, compared to 
41.5% of placebo subjects, which was statistically significant (p = 0.0438).

blind Treatment – Evaluable mITT Subjects, Study 305 
MIDAS Score 
The  MIDAS  Migraine  Disability  Assessment  score  retrospectively  reflects on how  many  days  a  patient 
was negatively affected by migraine throughout the preceding 3 months period. Results are presented 
for those subjects reporting the MIDAS score at baseline and at the end of the 3 months DBT. Baseline 
mean  MIDAS  scores  were  36.9  in  the  rimegepant  group  and  35.3  in  placebo  patients.  Rimegepant 
numerically hardly separated from placebo in reducing migraine-related disability (MIDAS: rimepgepant: 
-11.8, placebo -11.7, p=0.9616).

Treatment Estimated Using GLM Evaluable mITT Subjects with MIDAS Total Scores at Both

Subgroup analyses 
A number of subgroup analyses were conducted. Factors like age, sex, BMI,  number of baseline MDs 
(<14 or > 14 MDs), history of CM did not impact on the outcome for the primary endpoint. However, 
subjects  recruited  for  study  305  were  stratified  according  to  concomitant  prophylactic  migraine 
medication yes or no. In the subgroup of subjects receiving concomitant non-study migraine prophylactic 
medication (rimegepant arm: 75/348, 21.6%), rimegepant numerically hardly separated from placebo. 
Throughout  the  last  period  of  the  DBT  (week  9-12)  subjects  with  non-study  preventive  medication 
reduced the mean number of MDs by -3.5 in the rimegepant arm as compared to a reduction of -3.4 
(p=0.8993) in the placebo arm.

Open-label Extension Phase, Study 305 OLE 
At the completion of the 12-week DBT phase, subjects could enter into the 52-week OLE phase (Weeks 
13 through 64) if they continued to meet study entry criteria and laboratory test results were acceptable 
per protocol. The 52-week OLE period of study 305 was still ongoing at the time of dossier submission. 
Carry-over  to  OLE  from  the  DBT  period  was  high.  The  vast  majority  of  evaluable  mITT  subjects 
(rimegepant: 302/348 [86.8%], placebo: 301/347 [86.7%]) continued treatment and entered the OLE 
period. 
During  the  OLE  phase,  subjects  were  instructed  to  take  one  tablet  of  rimegepant  75  mg  every  other 
calendar day. If subjects had a migraine on a day that they were not scheduled to dose with rimegepant, 
they could take one tablet of rimegepant 75 mg on that calendar day to treat a migraine. Therefore, 
during the OLE phase, subjects could take a maximum of one rimegepant 75 mg tablet per calendar day 
for this 52-week period. Contrary to the DBT, triptans were not allowed as rescue during the OLE. 
The  figure  below  displays  the  mean  change  in  total  MDs  per  month  data  for  open-label  evaluable 
rimegepant mITT subjects.

Table 45: Summary of efficacy for Study 305 
Title:  A  Phase  2/3,  Randomized,  Double-blind,  Placebo-controlled  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and 
Safety of Rimegepant in Migraine Prevention 
Study identifier 
BHV3000-305 
clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03732638 
Design 
Phase  2/3,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy and safety of rimegepant 75 mg EOD in migraine prevention. The study 
enrolled subjects with both EM and CM), where chronic migraine was defined as 
a headache occurring on 15 or more days/month and met other IHS criteria for 
CM. The study consists of 4 phases: a 28-day screening phase, a 12-week DBT) 
phase, a 52-week OLE) phase, and an 8-week follow-up safety phase. During the 
28-day OP) subjects were to document each day if a migraine occurred and the 
migraine  intensity  and  characteristics.  If  eligible,  the  OP  subjects  were 
randomised  and  entered  the  12-week  DBT  phase  (Weeks  1-12),  during  which 
they were instructed to take 1 tablet of blinded study drug (rimegepant 75 mg 
or placebo) every other calendar day. If subjects had a migraine during the DBT, 
if needed, they could treat the migraine with their standard of care medication 
(incl. triptans) and were instructed to continue to take study medication on their 
regular schedule. At the completion of the 12-week DBT phase, subjects could 
enter into the 52-week OLE phase (Weeks 13-64), during which subjects were 
instructed to take 1 tablet of rimegepant 75 mg EOD. If subjects had a migraine 
on a day that they were not scheduled to dose with rimegepant, they could take 
1 tablet of rimegepant 75 mg on that calendar day to treat a migraine. Therefore, 
during the OLE phase, subjects could take a maximum of one rimegepant 75 mg 
tablet per calendar day for this 52-week period. During the OLE phase, triptans 
were not allowed as rescue.

* Statistically significant as determined by hierarchical testing. 
† Nominal p-value in hierarchical testing. 
Type 1 error was controlled through the use of hierarchical testing. The significance 
of the primary endpoint was evaluated at the 0.05 level. If the primary endpoint 
was significant, then the secondary endpoints were tested hierarchically in a fixed 
sequence in the order shown above (list not exhaustive), each at the 0.05 level. 
Thus, a secondary endpoint was tested only if the preceding secondary endpoint 
in  the  hierarchy  was  determined  to  be  significant.  Descriptive  p-values  were 
provided for any non-significant secondary endpoints.

Supportive study 
A  Multicenter,  Open-Label  Long-Term  Safety  Study  of  BHV-3000  in  the  Acute  Treatment  of 
Migraine (Protocol No. BHV3000-201, NCT03266588) 
The primary objective of phase 2/3, open-label, study 201 (Aug-2017 to Jul-2019, conducted at 103 US 
sites)  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  long-term  use  of  rimegepant  tablets  in  migraine 
patients. 
There were no primary or secondary efficacy objectives in this study. For the key exploratory endpoint, 
the number of migraine headache days and severity of migraine attacks during the period that subjects 
were treated with rimegepant relative to the OP were analysed from data collected using the eDiary. In 
study 201, a migraine day was defined as a day of eDiary data with a “yes” response to having a migraine 
without any further quantification criteria in terms of duration. 
After a 1-month OP, subjects were entered into long-term treatment (LTT) with rimegepant 75 mg. The 
majority  of  subjects  were  assigned  to  one  of  two  52-week  enrolment  groups,  where  they  could  take 
rimegepant on an as-needed (PRN) basis for the acute treatment of migraine. However, in one of the 
LTT  enrolment  groups  (lasting  12  weeks),  subjects  were  scheduled  to  dose  with  rimegepant  EOD, 
regardless of whether or not they were experiencing a migraine.  
Figure 14: BHV3000-201 Study Design Schematic 
In open-label, long-term safety study 201, subjects were not randomised, but allocated to three different 
enrolment  groups  according  to  the  self-reported  historical  rate of  migraine  attacks  per  month  for the 
subjects preceding enrolment in the cohort: PRN (2-8) [N=1033], PRN (9-14) [N=481], and EOD+PRN 
(4-14) [N=286]. In PRN groups rimegepant could be taken as needed (max. 1 tablet 75 mg RPG per 
day)  over  52  weeks,  in  the  EOD+PRN  group,  which  was  treated  for  12  weeks,  rimegepant  was 
administered prophylactically EOD plus the option to take rimegepant on non-scheduled days for acute 
attacks.  
Subject  demographics  do  not  inform  about  MDs  prior  to  study  entry,  hence,  do  not  specify  whether 
subjects suffered episodic or CM. The self-reported number of migraine attacks per month was 4.9 (PRN 
2-8 group), 10.8 (PRN 9-14 group), resp. 6.8 in the EOD+PRN (4-14) group.  
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 86/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects with analgesic overuse (history of non-narcotic analgesic intake on ≥ 15 days per month for ≥ 
3 months) were initially excluded. However, this restriction was removed with Revised Protocol v2.0. 
Importantly,  the  use  of  triptans  was  prohibited  during  LTT,  however,  triptans  were  allowed  for  acute 
migraine attack treatment during the OP. 
Across the N=1800 treated subjects, overall completion was about 66.5% (PRN2-8: 66.1%, PRN9-14: 
56.3%, EOD+PRN4-14: 85.0%). The higher completion rate in the EOD+PRN group is to be seen in the 
context, that the scheduled study duration for this group was 12 weeks only, as opposed to the PRN 
groups  with  a  planned  treatment  duration  of  52  weeks.  About  half  of  included  subjects  (51%) 
participated in one of the previous rimegepant single attack studies 301/302/303. Since the single attack 
studies 301/302/303 were placebo-controlled (1:1 randomisation), about a quarter of subjects recruited 
for study 201 actually has pre-knowledge of acute migraine treatment with rimegepant. 
Study 201 Exposure 
Overall, the mean time in the LTT period, based on eDiary records, was 36.1 weeks (PRN groups ([2-8]: 
42.1  weeks;  [9-14]:  38.0  weeks;  Scheduled  EOD  +  PRN  group:  11.3  weeks).  Within  the  enrolment 
groups, the median time in the LTT period was consistent with the protocol-specified treatment durations.  
Overall, 112,014 doses of rimegepant 75 mg were administered among the 1,800 subjects treated in 
the study. 
The median cumulative rimegepant exposure (number of tablets) was 50.0 tablets overall (PRN groups 
[2-8]:  52.0  tablets  and  [9-14]:  73.0  tablets;  and  43.0  tablets  in  the  Scheduled  EOD  +  PRN  group). 
Within the Scheduled EOD + PRN group, the mean average exposure was slightly less than 14 tablets 
per 4 weeks (13.7 tablets).

Exploratory analysis of MDs during LTT vs OP 
The mean overall change from OP over the long-term treatment period was -0.5 MDs per 4-week interval 
across all evaluable treated subjects of study 201. However, exploratory efficacy results are divergent 
between enrolment groups. While in the biggest enrolment group PRN (2-8) [N=1023] with historical 2-
8 migraine attacks per month the mean number of MDs per 4-week interval increased by 0.1 as compared 
to OP, the mean number of MDs decreased by -2.2 in the EOD+PRN group [N=278].

and Percent Changes from Observational Period by Severity over Time, Evaluable Treated 
Subjects, Study 201 
Evaluable treated subjects taking concomitant non-study prophylactic medication 
Across the three enrolment groups, a subgroup of 14.0% (252/1.800) subjects took concomitant non-
study  prophylactic  migraine  medication.  In  the  subgroup  of  subjects  with  concomitant  prophylactic 
medication, the mean overall change from OP over the long-term treatment period was -0.1 MDs per 4-
week interval across all enrolment groups of study 201. In the subgroup of patients with concomitant

and Percent Changes from Observational Period by Severity over Time Evaluable Treated

2.7.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The sponsor introduces RGP as the first orally administered CGRP antagonist to demonstrate benefit for 
both the acute treatment and prophylaxis of migraine. Accordingly, Vydura™ is proposed to be indicated 
for the comprehensive management of migraine in adults, including prophylaxis of migraine and acute 
treatment of migraine with or without aura.  
The wide indication proposed by the applicant does not differentiate between EM or CM subtypes. The 
present assessment of the clinical dossier was based on currently valid diagnostic criteria (IHCD-3) and 
most recent European resp. IHS treatment Guidance, which make a clear distinction between both the 
EM and CM target population, and the acute vs preventive treatment approach. 
The clinical dossier of rimegepant includes efficacy data from two separate sets of clinical studies that 
were provided for the acute (single attack studies 301 [N=1.084] / 302 [N=1.072] / 303 [N=1.351]) 
and  preventive  treatment  (study  305  [N=695])  of  migraine  under  randomised,  placebo-controlled 
conditions.  Supportive  data  include  phase  2b  dose-ranging  study  CN170003  ([N=811],  with  capsule) 
establishing rimegepant 75 mg as the minimum effective dose, and a phase 2/3, open-label, long-term 
safety study where subjects could receive rimegepant 75 mg doses for up to 52 weeks (201 [N=1.800]). 
All studies were conducted in the US. 
Single aspects of the phase III programme were designed according to current IHS resp. EMA guideline 
provisions,  like  e.g.  the  choice  of  efficacy  endpoints.  However,  a  number  of  uncertainties  resp. 
shortcomings were also identified, which will be further explored in the following. 
With regard to acute treatment of migraine, single attack studies 301, 302 and 303 followed standard 
guidance and were almost identical in design, apart from the study drug formulation (study 303 with 
final ODT formulation, studies 301/302 with intermediate tablet formulation). Bioequivalence between 
the tablet and ODT formulation was established.  
As concerns migraine attack frequency, subjects were required to have suffered not more than 8 attacks 
of moderate / severe intensity per month, and have suffered less than 15 days with headache (migraine

or non-migraine) per month in each of the 3 months prior to screening. Hence, the study population is 
inferred to correspond to the EM type, however, specific IHS diagnostic codes were not provided at study 
entry. Subjects with MoH were not included. 
The inclusion criteria specify that subjects with contraindications to triptans may be eligible, provided 
they meet all other study entry criteria. Contraindications to triptans mainly concern CV safety. However, 
patients with uncontrolled, unstable or recently diagnosed CV disease, such as ischemic heart disease, 
coronary artery vasospasm, cerebral ischemia, MI, ACS etc. were excluded from 301/302/303. Overall, 
subjects with CV risk factors that would contraindicate triptan use were relatively uncommon. In mITT 
subjects, 17 of 1,749 rimegepant subjects (1.0%) and 12 of 1,758 placebo subjects (0.7%) reported 
risk  factors  that  would  contraindicate  triptan  use.  There  is  no  statement  in  the  proposed  rimegepant 
SmPC highlighting or claiming a potential advantage of RGP as compared to triptans in terms of the CV 
risk profile. 
Participants  were  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  and  dispensed  1  dose  of  study  medication  consisting  of 
rimegepant 75 mg ODT or matching placebo. Notably, subjects did not have the option to take a second 
tablet for rescue or recurrence of pain. Concomitant prophylactic migraine medication was permitted, if 
stable for at least 3 months prior to study entry. In single attack studies 301/302/303, rescue medication 
is prohibited until the 2-hour post-dose assessment for the primary endpoint. Thereafter, subjects were 
allowed to take unspecific analgesics (at 2-hours post-dose), triptans (earliest 48 hours post-dose) or 
antiemetics for rescue, if pain relief was not achieved or pain recurs. The efficacy assessment time spans 
over 48 hours post-dose to record sustained pain relief from 2-48 hours post-dose. Once rescue Mx was 
taken, any subsequent efficacy assessment is classified as failure. 
The most relevant efficacy endpoints in single attack studies 301/302/303 are adequately chosen and 
are in line with guideline provisions. These include pain resp. MBS freedom at 2 hours post-dose (co-
primary), sustained freedom from pain / MBS from 2-24 or 2-48 hours post-dose, and pain relief at early 
assessment time points.  
The  co-primary  efficacy  endpoints  for  the  3  pivotal  studies,  i.e.  pain  and  MBS  freedom  at  2  hours 
following  initial  dose,  are  fully  concordant  with  current  IHS  Guidance.  Prior  to  dosing,  patients  were 
asked to assess and record their pain severity using the IHS 4-point pain severity rating scale (0 = no 
pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, and 3 = severe pain). Pain freedom was defined as a reduction 
in  pain  severity  from  mild,  moderate,  or  severe  at  baseline  to  none.  At  the  same  time,  subjects  also 
recorded presence or absence (yes or no) of each  of the following associated symptoms of migraine: 
nausea,  phonophobia,  and  photophobia.  From  the  list  of  present  associated  symptoms  the  subjects 
identified  which  ONE  was  most  bothersome  to  them  as  the  MBS.  Improvement  of  other  associated 
symptoms  (nausea,  photophobia,  phonophobia,)  at  2  hours  post-dose  was  also  recorded  as  further 
secondary endpoint. Other endpoints included sustained freedom from pain /  MBS from 2-24 or 2-48 
hours post-dose, and pain relief at early assessment time points 
Rimegepant was tested for superiority over placebo, at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, on both co-primary 
endpoints. Both endpoints were evaluated using CMH tests stratified by the use of prophylactic migraine 
medication  (yes  or  no).  The  population  summary,  the  between  group  difference  in  the  percentage  of 
pain  free  subjects,  is  assessed  by  computing  the  “risk  difference”  between  treatment  groups.  This 
analysis is appropriate. 
As concerns baseline demographics, the mITT population is considered as typically representative of the 
migraine target population in terms of age (mean of 40-42 years, 96.8% < 65 years), gender (85-89% 
female),  history  of  migraine  with  aura  (30-37%),  and  the  portion  of  subjects  receiving  preventive 
medication  (13-17%).  At  screening,  about  one  third  of  subjects  was  currently  using  triptans  for  the 
treatment of acute attacks. The mean duration of migraine history is about 20 years at study entry. The

median number of moderate to severe migraine attacks per month is 4.0 across treatment arms. The 
majority of subjects is considered moderately to severely affected by the disease. 
The EMA Guideline recommends that single attack studies are supplemented with studies on consistency 
of effect with regard to general variability of migraine attacks. A consistency study 304 across 4 acute 
migraine attacks was originally planned (along EMA guideline provisions) and discussed within the scope 
of EMA SA from May 2018, however, no consistency data were submitted.  
As  concerns  prophylactic  migraine  treatment,  essential  features  of  pivotal  prevention  study  305  are 
accordant  with  EU  Guideline  provisions.  The  frequency  of  migraine  attacks  is  documented  during  an 
initial prospective 1-month OP. The DBT period covers a 12 week duration. During DBT, subjects were 
randomised 1:1 to receive either RGP or placebo. 
Based  on  efficacy  data  obtained  from  pivotal  trials  in  acute  migraine  (studies  301/302/303),  it  was 
assumed that the beneficial effect of rimegepant was maintained for up to 48 hours post-administration. 
This  finding  lead  to  the  rationale  of  testing  rimegepant  in  subsequent  migraine  prevention  trial  305 
following an every-other-day (EOD) dosing schedule.  
An active control arm was not included. Large and highly variable placebo effects have been observed in 
past migraine prevention trials. Therefore, placebo control is indispensable. An active control arm would 
have provided added information to contextualize the clinical effect of the test medication, however, is 
not considered essential from the regulatory perspective. Throughout the 12-week DBT period, subjects 
had to treat acute attacks (if any occurred) using their usual standard medication, i.e. PRN rimegepant 
was not allowed. On the contrary, during the subsequent 1-year open-label extension (OLE) period (wk 
13-64) PRN rimegepant could be used in case an acute migraine attack occurred. However, a maximum 
daily dose of 75 mg rimegepant had to be observed, i.e. PRN rimegepant could only be taken on days 
for which every-other-day (EOD) rimegepant for prevention was not scheduled.  
It  is  inherent  to  claimed  comprehensive  management  of  migraine  that  rimegepant  may  be  taken  as 
needed for acute migraine attacks on top of regular preventive RGP administration. The lack of controlled 
data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of combined acute and prophylactic use of rimegepant is 
considered a major limitation of the present clinical data package. The efficacy of RGP, taken for acute 
migraine  attacks,  was  not  demonstrated  under  placebo-controlled  conditions  in  subjects  already 
receiving regular preventive RGP. On the other side, it is noted that exclusion of additional rimegepant 
doses to be taken PRN for acute attacks during the 12-wk DBT period, allows for proper and focussed 
evaluation of rimegepant’s effect in migraine prevention.  
To  be  eligible  for  participation  in  prevention  study  305,  subjects  had  to  present  with  4-18  migraine 
attacks per month, respectively at least 6 MD and not more than 18 headache days. IHS diagnostic code 
1.3 for CM requires headache to occur on 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months, which 
has  the  features  of  migraine  headache  on  at  least  8  days  per  month.  Hence,  the  inclusion  criteria  of 
study 305 may include both EM and CM patients. The applicant did not provide respective IHS codes 1.1, 
1.2.1, or 1.3 of included subjects. 
Subjects could remain on their stable prophylactic treatment, as long as these do not belong to the group 
of  CGRP  antagonists  (either  biological  or  small  molecule).  There  is  no  objection  to  exclusion  of  other 
CGRP  antagonists  since  existing  CGRP  antagonist  therapy  leaves  little  (virtually  no)  space  for  further 
improvement  through  rimegepant.  During  the  DBT  period  subjects  may  take  their  usual  rescue 
medication for acute attacks, incl. triptans. Throughout the subsequent OLE period, however, triptans 
were prohibited. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of study 305 was the change from the OP in the mean number of MD) per 
month  in  the  last  month  (Weeks  9  to  12)  of  the  DBT  phase.  Initially,  study  305  was  planned  for  EM 
patients,  with  implementation  of  the  4th  Protocol  Amendment  inclusion  criteria  were  widened  to  also

include subjects with a history of CM. In the context of recruiting a mixed of EM/CM population in study 
305, implications result as concerns definition of a migraine day. The IHS issued two guidance documents 
for  preventive  treatment  of  migraine  attacks:  The  first  one  for  preventive  treatment  in  CM  patients 
(Tassorelli et al, 2018) and the second one for preventive treatment in EM patients (Diener HC et al. 
2020).  These  guidance  documents  specify  different  definitions  of  what  constitutes  a  “Migraine  Day”. 
While in the EM population a MD is defined as a day with headache lasting at least 30 minutes without 
intake of analgesics and meeting ICHD-3 criteria for migraine or probable migraine, the guidance for CM 
requires the headache to last at least 4 hours (all other criteria identical). Since reduction from baseline 
in  the  mean  number  of  MDs  per  month  in  the  last  4  weeks  of  the  12-week  DBT  period  is  defined  as 
primary efficacy endpoint, the definition of a MD is of critical importance. In the present study 305, the 
sponsor defined a MD along the provisions for an EM population. 
The principal analysis of the primary endpoint used a GLMEM, subject as a random effect with number 
of total MDs per month in the OP as a covariate, and treatment group, prophylactic migraine medication 
use at randomisation, month (i.e., months 1 to 3 of the DBT phase), and the month-by-treatment group 
interaction  as  fixed  effects.  However,  this  analysis  targets  the  hypothetical  effect  ‘if  all  patients  were 
fully adherent to treatment’ that is not of primary regulatory interest. Therefore, the jump to reference 
analysis,  that  was  provided  as  sensitivity  analysis  targeting  the  effect  regardless  of  treatment 
discontinuation (treatment policy), should be considered of primary relevance for efficacy assessment.  
Subjects included in prevention  study  305 experienced  a  median number of  8.0  migraine  attacks  per 
month. A portion of 12.9% was severely affected experiencing > 12 attacks per month. With the 4th of 
8 amendments implemented to the Protocol of study 305, eligibility criteria were expanded to also include 
subjects with CM, which were previously excluded. The number of allowed days per month with headache 
was increased to 18. However, the actual number of subjects fulfilling CM diagnostic criteria at baseline 
is  not  fully  clear,  since  only  “History  of  CM”  is  reported.  For  a  subgroup  of  subjects,  that  previously 
participated  in  studies  301/302/303  (and  therefore  had  pre-knowledge  of  study  medication), 
participation in study 305 was opened with Protocol Amendment No.6. With regard to maintenance of 
the blind, the applicant asserts that subjects remained blinded to randomised study drug. 
Primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  analysed  using  evaluable  mITT  subjects, i.e.  enrolled 
subjects  who  were  randomised  only  once,  received  at  least  1  dose  of  double-blind  study  medication 
(rimegepant or placebo), and had ≥ 14 days of eDiary efficacy data (not necessarily consecutive) in both 
the  OP  and  at  least  1  month  (i.e.,  4-week  interval)  in  the  DBT  phase.  The  portion  of  subjects  not 
considered mITT evaluable due to less than 14 days of eDiary efficacy data in any of the 3 treatment 
months  (28  day  intervals)  was  low  (rimegepant  5.9%,  placebo  6.5%)  and  equally  distributed  across 
arms. Additional analyses in treated subjects were presented. 
Supportive, exploratory efficacy data are obtained from open-label, LTT safety study 201. Subjects were 
not  randomised,  but  allocated  to  three  different  enrolment  groups  according  to  the  self-reported 
historical rate of migraine attacks per month: PRN (2-8) [N=1033], PRN (9-14) [N=481], and EOD+PRN 
(4-14) [N=286]. In PRN groups, rimegepant could be taken as needed (max. 1 tablet 75 mg RGP per 
day)  over  52  weeks,  in  the  EOD+PRN  group,  which  was  treated  for  12  weeks,  rimegepant  was 
administered prophylactically EOD plus the option to take rimegepant on non-scheduled days for acute 
attacks.  Subject  demographics  do  not  inform  about  migraine  or  headache  days  prior  to  study  entry, 
hence, do not specify whether subjects suffered EM or CM. The self-reported number of migraine attacks 
per month was 4.9 (PRN 2-8 group), 10.8 (PRN 9-14 group), resp. 6.8 in the EOD+PRN (4-14) group.  
Exploratory efficacy assessments conducted in study 201 related to the effect of repeated rimegepant 
75  mg  dosing  on  the  frequency  of  MDs  during  the  up-to-1-year  long-term  treatment  (LTT)  period  as 
compared to the 28-day OP, based on daily eDiary entries. In study 201, a migraine day was defined as 
a day of eDiary data with a “yes” response to having a migraine without any further quantification criteria

in  terms  of  duration  etc.  Accurate  comparability  between the  OP  and  4-week  LTT  treatment  intervals 
was compromised by the fact that the use of triptans as rescue medication was prohibited during LTT, 
however, subjects were permitted to use triptans during the 4-week OP. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  terms  of  subject  disposition,  study  completion  was  very  high  across  the  3  single  attack  studies 
301/302/303 and dose arms (around 99% for rimegepant 75 mg and placebo), which does not surprise, 
given the shortness of intervention. Subjects were given a 45-day period to treat 1 acute migraine attack. 
A migraine attack of moderate to severe intensity was not experienced in only very isolated cases during 
that time.  
Equally, a high portion of subjects completed the 12-week DBT period of prevention study 305 (84.5%, 
equally  distributed  across  arms:  rimegepant  85.4%,  placebo  83.6%).  Only  very  few  subjects 
discontinued due to AE on DBT or subsequent OLE period (n=13 [3.5%] rimegepant, n=5 [1.7%] placebo 
patients). About equal portions of subjects continued to the OLE phase after terminating the DBT period 
(rimegepant: 81.6%, placebo: 81.4%). 
Across the 3 pivotal single attack studies, superiority over placebo could consistently be shown for both 
co-primary  endpoints,  i.e.  portions  of  patients  achieving  pain  freedom  resp.  MBS  freedom  at  2  hours 
post-dose.  Despite  statistical  significance,  the  overall  effect  size  is  rather  modest  (net  risk  difference 
over placebo for 2-hour pain freedom: 301: 4.91%, 302: 7.59%, 303: 10.37%).  
As concerns the co-primary rate of MBS  freedom at 2-hours post-dose, both rimegepant and placebo 
response rates were higher as compared to response rates for pain freedom. The net risk difference over 
placebo,  however,  remains  modest  (net  risk  difference  over  placebo  for  2-hour  MBS  freedom:  301: 
8.90%, 302: 12.38%, 303: 8.29%). However modest with regard to the magnitude of the effect size, it 
is noted that placebo superiority could be reproduced in terms of the two co-primary endpoints across 3 
independent single attack studies. 
The co-primary endpoints are based on data entry into the e-diary at the 2 hours post-dose assessment 
time point. If data at 2 hours were missing, these were imputed as failures for the primary CMH analysis. 
The portion of imputed data was low, in the range of 3.0-7.8% across the two co-primary endpoints and 
single  attack  studies.  As  long  as  the  rate  of  imputed  data  is  about  equal  between  the  arms,  or  even 
higher in the rimegepant arm, the approach taken for the primary analysis is considered conservative. 
The LOCF, Complete case, and multiple imputation sensitivity analyses did not change the overall results 
across studies. In several cases, the sensitivity analyses even yielded higher risk differences in favour 
of rimegepant as compared to risk difference resulting from the primary CMH analysis. 
A multitude of secondary efficacy endpoints were tested hierarchically in studies 301 and 302. Freedom 
of  associated  symptoms  (photophobia,  phonophobia,  nausea)  was  placed  high  in  the  hierarchy.  After 
statistical significance could not be shown for freedom from nausea at 2 post-dose, all endpoints listed 
afterwards in the hierarchy were not considered statistically significant in either study. From the CHMP 
perspective, there was no imminent necessity to arrange the hierarchical order of testing the secondary 
endpoints  in  the  way  it  was  conducted  in  studies  301/302.  In  study  303,  the  hierarchical  order  was 
modified. In line with EMA Guideline provisions, demonstration of sustained freedom of pain from 2-24 
hours  and/or  from  2-48  hours  post-dose  are  considered  meaningful  endpoints.  In  line  with  results 
obtained for the co-primary endpoints, net differences over placebo were modest for sustained effect-
related  endpoints.  However,  across  all  single  attack  studies,  numerical  differences  in  favour  of 
rimegepant could be shown (risk difference (%) / p-values: pain freedom 2-24 hour: 301: 5.86 / 0.002, 
302:  5.19  /  0.004,  303:  10.12  /  <.0001*;  pain  freedom  2-48  hour:  301:  4.39  /  0.013,  302:  3.89  / 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 93/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
0.018, 303: 8.02 / <.0001*). Due to hierarchical testing, however, statistical superiority over placebo 
could only be shown for sustained pain freedom in study 303. 
Contrary  to  freedom  from  photophobia  and  phonophobia  at  2  hours  post-dose,  for  which  consistent 
superiority over placebo could be shown, rimegepant did not significantly separate from placebo for the 
freedom from nausea as associated symptom. The differential effect of rimegepant, on the associated 
symptoms, photophobia/phonophobia on the one side, and nausea/vomiting on the other side, could be 
explained  by  different  pathophysiological  mechanisms  causing  the  symptoms,  with  the  ones  being 
affected by rimegepant’s CGRP antagonism, while the others aren’t.  
Throughout single attack studies 301/302/303, subjects were instructed not to use rescue medication 
until the 2-hours post-dose assessment time point for the co-primary endpoints. Thereafter, the use of 
rescue medication rises fairly steeply. Within the course of 24 hours, about 14-20% of subjects receiving 
rimegepant as first dose took additional rescue medication. 
Concerns about lacking proof of consistency of rimegepant’s effect across multiple acute attacks are to 
be seen in the context of the modest net treatment effect shown in single attack studies 301/302/303 
and the poor outcome of exploratory efficacy data in PRN enrolment groups of long-term study 201. The 
applicant’s assertion that consistency would have been shown by long-term data (e.g. study 201) does 
not address consistency as specified in the guideline. 
In terms of migraine prevention, subjects receiving prophylactic EOD 75 mg rimegepant tablets reduced 
the mean number of MDs by -4.3, as opposed placebo subjects who achieved a reduction of MD by -3.5 
days throughout the last 4 weeks (week 9-12) of the DBT. Although statistical superiority over placebo 
could be demonstrated (p=.0099) using the primary GLMEM analysis, the net difference of 0.8 MD per 
month is considered modest. However, the applied GLMEM analysis is not considered as the analysis that 
targets the effect of primary regulatory interest. The jump to reference analysis targeting the treatment 
policy estimand, which was provided as sensitivity analysis, is considered as the adequate analysis. If 
the sensitivity analysis Jump-to-Reference is applied, the net difference between rimegepant and placebo 
in evaluable mITT subjects in terms of MD reduction throughout the last 4 weeks (wk 9-12) of the DBT 
is further diminished to -0.7 MDs (p=0.0400). 
In order to more accurately describe the clinical relevance of the net difference over placebo, the change 
of  MDs  from  the  OP  over  the  12-week  DBT  is  to  be  taken  into  account.  During  the  OP,  subjects 
experienced 10.3 (rimegepant) resp. 9.9 (placebo) MDs. In both arms, the number of MDs per 28-day 
assessment  period  decreases  constantly  per  month  throughout  the  12-week  DBT  period.  In  terms  of 
percent reduction, the number of MDs was reduced by -50.3% in rimegepant subjects, while placebo 
subjects  achieved  to  reduce  the  mean  number  of  MDs  from  week  9-12  by  -41.7%.  The  overall  net 
difference of -0.7 MDs per month between rimegepant and placebo corresponds to less than 10% of the 
number of MDs experienced at baseline. 
Reduction in monthly MDs starts early after initiation of EOD rimegepant 75 mg treatment. The difference 
over  placebo  is  largest  during  the  first  month  of  the  3  months  DBT  (-1.2  MDs).  Thereafter,  the  net 
difference over placebo diminished in line with increasing placebo response in the course of the 12-week 
treatment period.  
A  number  of  subgroup  analyses  were  conducted.  Subjects  recruited  for  study  305  were  stratified 
according  to  concomitant  prophylactic  migraine  medication.  In  the  subgroup  of  subjects  receiving 
concomitant non-study migraine prophylactic medication (rimegepant arm: 75/348, 21.6%), rimegepant 
numerically hardly separated from placebo. Throughout the last period of the DBT (wk 9-12) subjects 
with non-study preventive medication reduced the mean number of MDs by -3.5 in the rimegepant arm 
as  compared  to  a  reduction  of  -3.4  (p=0.8993)  in  the  placebo  arm.  Subjects  without  concomitant 
preventive treatment reduced MDs to the same degree (-0.8 MDs net difference over control, Jump to

Reference) as observed in the total mITT population of study 305. The benefit of the use of rimegepant 
in migraine prevention in subjects already receiving individual prophylactic medication is unclear. 
Throughout  the  12-week  double  blind  treatment  period,  subjects  could  use  their  individual  rescue 
medication  (incl.  triptans,  NSAIDs,  antiemetics)  in  case  an  acute  migraine  attack  occurred  despite 
preventive study medication. Across arms and the three 28-day treatment intervals of the DBT, subjects 
used rescue on a mean of about 4-5 days per month. Rimegepant did not significantly separate from 
placebo in any of the three 28-day intervals of the DBT in terms of rescue medication use. 
Borderline  significance  (net  effect  over  placebo:  7.6%,  p=0.0438)  could  be  shown  for  the  responder 
analysis of subjects achieving a 50% reduction in moderate or severe MDs during week 9-12 of the DBT. 
The  MIDAS  Migraine  Disability  Assessment  score  retrospectively  reflects on how  many  days  a  patient 
was negatively affected by migraine throughout the preceding 3 months period. Results are presented 
for those subjects reporting the MIDAS score at baseline and at the end of the 3 months DBT. Baseline 
mean  MIDAS  scores  were  36.9  in  the  rimegepant  group  and  35.3  in  placebo  patients.  Rimegepant 
numerically hardly separated from placebo in reducing migraine-related disability (MIDAS: rimepgepant: 
-11.8,  placebo  -11.7,  p=0.9616)  during  the  12-week  DBT  period.  However,  meaningful  reductions  in 
MIDAS scores were achieved over time (week 24, week 64) over the 1-year OLE period of study 305. 
According to study 305 demographics, subjects reported at study entry whether there was a history of 
CM (yes 22.7%, no 43.6%, not reported 33.7%). The applicant did not pre-specify stratified analysis of 
migraine  prevention  results  in  EM  vs  CM.  Only  ad  hoc  exploratory  results  are  presented,  not  yielding 
statistical significance for the subgroup of “historical CM” in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint (Total 
MD  reduction  from  OP  to  week  9-12  of  DBT).  In  preceding  MAAs  concerning the  use  of  biologicals  in 
migraine prevention, separated studies in properly defined EM vs CM populations were conducted in line 
with IHS Guidance.  
Supportive,  exploratory,  efficacy  results  were  obtained  from  open-label,  long-term  safety  study  201. 
Subjects were not randomised, but allocated to three different enrolment groups according to the self-
reported historical rate of migraine attacks (range specified in parentheses) per month for the subjects 
preceding enrolment in the cohort: PRN (2-8) [N=1033], PRN (9-14) [N=481], and EOD+PRN (4-14) 
[N=286]. In PRN groups rimegepant could be taken as needed (max. 1 tablet 75 mg RPG per day) over 
52  weeks,  in  the  EOD+PRN  group,  which  was  treated  for  12  weeks,  rimegepant  was  administered 
prophylactically EOD plus the option to take rimegepant on non-scheduled days for acute attacks. The 
number of MDs experienced per 28-day interval during the LTT period was compared with the OP. 
Exploratory efficacy results of study 201 demonstrate that the long-term overall effect in acute migraine 
treatment is modest in the PRN (9-14) group (-0.9 MDs) and virtually no beneficial effect was observed 
in terms of reduced mean MDs per month as compared to OP in the largest enrolment group PRN (2-8) 
of subjects historically experiencing 2-8 attacks per month (+0.1 MDs). 
As  concerns  exposure  in  study  201,  the  median  duration  of  study  continuation  corresponded  to  the 
scheduled  duration  for  the  respective  enrolment  groups  (52  weeks  for  PRN  groups  and  12  weeks  for 
EOD+PRN). In PRN enrolment groups, subjects were free to take rimegepant as needed (MDD 1 tablet 
of 75 mg rimegepant) and did so on a mean of 5.6 (PRN 2-8), resp. 8.5 (PRN 9-14) days. In the EOD+PRN 
enrolment group, planned to be treated for 12 weeks,  subjects were instructed to take 1 rimegepant 
tablet EOD (corresponding to 14 tablets per 4-week interval) plus 1 tablet on non-scheduled dosing days 
as needed. Usage of as needed rimegepant was very low, as illustrated by median 14.2 tablets per 4 
weeks. Full EOD treatment compliance would translate into 14 tablets. The low use of rimegepant in the 
EOD+PRN  group  (median  14.2  tablets  per  4-week  interval),  hardly  corresponding  to  compliant  EOD 
administration, may support the preventive use of rimegepant in migraine prevention under open-label

conditions, however, does not allow any conclusions to be drawn on the effect of acute (as needed) use 
of rimegepant under open-label regular EOD dosing conditions. 
2.7.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
To  support  the  claimed  comprehensive  management  of  migraine  in  adults,  including  prophylaxis  and 
acute treatment, four pivotal RCTs were provided  to demonstrate the efficacy  of rimegepant in  acute 
migraine treatment (single attack studies 301/302/303) and migraine prevention (study 305). Statistical 
significant  effects  along  primary  efficacy  endpoints  could  be  shown,  however,  the  following 
considerations need also to be taken into account.  
• 
The placebo-subtracted treatment effect observed across the 3 pivotal single attacks studies (net 
risk difference over placebo for 2-hour pain freedom: 301: 4.91%, 302: 7.59%, 303: 10.37%) 
is modest.  
•  A guideline-conforming prospective, placebo-controlled proof of within-patient consistency in 
acute migraine is lacking. Exploratory data obtained from acute migraine treatment during OLE 
of study 305 on unscheduled EOD dosing days were provided post hoc. These provide some 
insight into reproducibility of treatment success in consecutive acute attacks, however, have 
severe limitations. They reflect uncontrolled open-label conditions in patients with maintenance 
EOD preventive dosing that could only take rimegepant for acute migraine on non-scheduled 
dosing days. A focused analysis in subgroups of patients with > 3 moderate to severe MDs 
(N=350) and those with > 4 MDs (N=310) was provided on the first 3 resp. 4 attacks, detailing 
the number of patients achieving 2-hours pain freedom in 0, 1, 2, 3, (4) of the first attacks and 
calculating the portion of subjects achieving pain freedom in at least 2 out of first 3, resp. 3 
out of first 4 attacks.  
The profile obtained largely corresponds to the modest treatment effect already observed 
across the single attack studies 301/302/303. In both subgroups of patients with > 3, 
respectively > 4 moderate to severe migraine attacks, more than half of patients could not 
successfully treat a single attack of the first three resp. four attacks (0 out of 3: 58.4%; 0 out 
of 4: 52.4%). Only a very small minority of patients achieved pain freedom at 2 hours post-
dose in every single of the first 3 resp. 4 attacks (3 out of 3: 5.3%; 4 out of 4: 3.4%).  
As could be expected, the magnitude of requested within-patient consistency parameter (2 out 
of 3: 16.5%, resp. 3 out 4: 9.7%) is considerably smaller than the average absolute responder 
rates observed across the three single attack studies 301/302/303 of 19-21% (placebo 10.9 – 
14.2%). 
• 
• 
In study 305, the net difference over placebo in terms of MD reduction was limited (-0.8 MDs for 
the primary GLMEM analysis; -0.7 MDs for the relevant Jump-to-Reference sensitivity analysis 
over  a  28-day  treatment period  (week  9-12)  of  DBT),  corresponding to  less than  10%  of  the 
mean number of MD at baseline (10.3-9.9 MDs). 
The modest treatment effect for the primary endpoint goes along with non-significant treatment 
effects in relevant subgroups of patients (e.g. CM history, subjects with less than 8 attacks per 
month, subjects > 65 years of age, subjects continuing their non-study prophylactic medication). 
The applicant claimed a broad indication of migraine prevention irrespective of EM or CM classification. 
However,  the  CM  subgroup  was  too  small  to  be  able  to  show  any  effect  independently.  Furthermore, 
data does not allow a precise estimation on the treatment effect in this subgroup

2.8.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
As of 03-Sep-2020, more than 7,200 subjects have participated in Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects 
or Phase 2 and 3 studies in subjects with migraine in the rimegepant clinical development programme. 
Among these subjects, more than 3,800 unique subjects have received the rimegepant clinical dose of 
75  mg  in  Phase  2  and  3  studies,  including  1,857 unique  subjects  who  received  rimegepant  75  mg  in 
single-dose studies: 1,771 unique subjects in the three pivotal Phase 3 single-dose, placebo-controlled 
acute treatment studies (i.e., BHV3000-303, BHV3000-302, and BHV3000-301), and 86 subjects in the 
Phase  2b  dose-ranging  study  CN170003.  Safety  data  are  also  available  for  the  2,471  subjects  who 
received rimegepant 75 mg in the Phase 2/3 multiple-dose studies (BHV3000-201 and BHV3000-305).  
In  the  pivotal  migraine  prophylaxis  study  (BHV3000-305),  the  OLE  phase  remains  ongoing  as  of  the 
safety snapshot for this summary and a total of 527 subjects received rimegepant (EOD or EOD + PRN 
up to QD) for at least 6 months, and 311 subjects received rimegepant for at least 1 year. 
Overall, among the 1,800 subjects treated in BHV3000-201 with an average rimegepant exposure of ≥ 
2 tablets per 4 weeks, 954 (53.0%) were in the LTT period for ≥ 1 year. In the long-term, open-label 
safety study 201, the median time in the LTT period overall was 51.1 weeks. Overall, 1,154 (64.1%) 
subjects  had  at  least  6  months  of  rimegepant  exposure,  and  368  (20.4%)  subjects  had  1  year  of 
rimegepant exposure. A total of 112,014 doses of rimegepant 75 mg were administered among the 1,800 
subjects treated in the study.

Table 49: Study Pools for Analyses of Safety Data: Treated Subjects 
In study 305, a total of N=747 subjects were randomised, and 741 subjects were treated with rimegepant 
(370 subjects) or placebo (371 subjects) in the DBT phase. 
The DBT phase of prevention study 305 is complete; there are no treated subjects ongoing in this phase. 
The majority of treated subjects (626/741, 84.5%) completed the DBT phase.

Adverse events 
Acute treatment – On-treatment adverse events – SD studies 
On-treatment AEs were specified as those occurring from the study drug first dose through the study 
drug last dose + 7 days. Notably, on-treatment AEs were differentiated from treatment-emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) (defined as those occurring, worsening, or becoming serious during treatment relative to pre-
treatment). 
Across  the  single-dose  studies,  on-treatment  AEs  were  reported  in  192  (10.8%)  subjects  in  the 
rimegepant group and 154 (8.6%) subjects in the placebo group. The most frequently (≥ 1.0% in either 
treatment group) reported on-treatment AE was nausea (rimegepant 1.2%, placebo 0.8%), followed by 
urinary tract infections (rimegepant 0.8%, placebo 0.3%).

Acute treatment – On-treatment AEs – Long-term study 201 
Overall,  on-treatment  AEs  were  reported  in  1,088  (60.4%)  treated  subjects  of  study  201.  The  most 
frequently  ( ≥   2.0%  overall)  reported  on-treatment  AEs  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infections, 
nasopharyngitis,  sinusitis,  influenza,  bronchitis,  urinary  tract  infections,  nausea,  dizziness,  back  pain, 
and arthralgia. In general, the frequencies of AEs were comparable between the PRN groups and lower 
in the Scheduled EOD + PRN group. These differences likely reflected the longer treatment durations in 
the PRN groups.

Prophylactic treatment – On-treatment AEs – Study 305 
The safety profile of rimegepant 75 mg administered EOD for up to 12 weeks was comparable to placebo 
in the DBT phase of BHV3000-305. The majority of AEs  were mild, not related to study therapy, and 
resolved without treatment. There were no new safety signals, in either the double-blind or open-label 
phase,  and  the  AEs  reported  were  consistent  with  those  reported  in  previous  clinical  studies  of 
rimegepant. Overall, in the double-blind or open-label phase, the most commonly reported (≥ 2%) on-
treatment  AEs  were  upper  respiratory  infection,  nasopharyngitis,  back  pain,  influenza,  urinary  tract 
infection, sinusitis, and nausea.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
In the Phase 3, single-dose, placebo-controlled rimegepant studies, a single on-treatment Serious AE 
(SAE) was reported in the rimegepant group (1/1,771 subjects, 0.1%; back  pain). Two on-treatment 
SAEs  were  reported  in  the  placebo  group  (2/1,782  subjects,  0.1%;  chest  pain  and  urinary  tract 
infection). 
On-treatment SAEs in long-term study 201 were reported in 47 (2.6%) subjects (PRN [2-8]: 28 [2.7%] 
subjects;  PRN  [9-14]:  16  [3.3%]  subjects;  Scheduled  EOD  +  PRN:  3  [1.0%]  subjects.  The  following 
SAEs were reported in more than 1 subject: 
•  Accidental overdose, appendicitis, osteoarthritis, and pulmonary embolism in 3 (0.2%) subjects 
each 
•  Constipation, pneumonia, and sepsis in 2 (0.1%) subjects each 
No pattern of SAEs was observed that would suggest specific safety concerns for rimegepant. 
One patient (60-70 years) with Crohn´s disease assigned to PRN9-14 group of study 201 experienced 
an imaged-confirmed SAE of ischaemic colitis and permanently discontinued the trial.  
During  the  DBT  phase  of  prevention  study  305,  SAEs  were  reported  in  3  (0.8%)  subjects  in  the 
rimegepant group and 4 (1.1%) subjects in the placebo group.

Deaths 
There were no deaths in any of the studies supporting safety in the acute treatment of migraine. 
There  were  2  deaths  in  the  pivotal  Phase  2/3  migraine  prophylaxis  study  BHV3000-305,  both  were 
deemed by the study investigators as not related to study drug and both occurred in the OLE phase of 
the study (septic shock likely related with diverticulitis and aortic aneurysm due to Marfan´s syndrome). 
Laboratory findings 
Analyses  of  serum  chemistry,  haematology,  and  urin  were  conducted  and  did  not  point  to  clinically 
relevant safety concerns. 
Safety in special populations 
Four categories of AEs of special interest were identified for the rimegepant clinical programme:  
1)  hepatic-related AEs; 
2)  suicidality AEs; 
3)  AEs categorised as potentially associated with drug abuse; and 
4)  CV AEs 
Additionally, the applicant was requested to carefully collect AEs of special interest such as e.g. rebound, 
sleep disturbance, non-migraine headaches and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances within the scope of 
EMA SA from May 2018. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders Adverse Events 
In long-term study 201, on-treatment AEs in the GI Disorders System Organ Class (SOC were reported 
overall  in  232  (12.9%)  subjects.  The  most  frequent  Preferred  Terms  (PTs  were  nausea  (51  [2.8%] 
subjects)  and  diarrhoea  (34  [1.9%]  subjects).  Constipation  was  reported  in  29  (1.6%)  subjects.  In 
general, the overall frequency of AEs was somewhat higher in the PRN groups than the Scheduled EOD 
+PRN group, likely reflecting the longer treatment durations in the PRN groups.

during  the  placebo-controlled  12-week  DBT  period  of  prevention  study  305,  nausea  (1.5-2.8%)  was 
reported most often, followed by diarrhoea (1.9-1.6%) and constipation (1.6-1.1%) after multiple dose 
administration.

Sleep disturbance 
On-treatment AEs of sleep disturbance were reported overall in 9 (0.5%) subjects of study 201 and were 
reported  in  a  low  frequency  of  subjects  during  DBT  phase  of  study  305  in  either  treatment  group  (1

Across  the  SD  studies,  4  rimegepant-treated  and  7  placebo-treated  subjects  had  a  reported  medical 
history of Raynaud’s phenomenon; no events of Raynaud’s phenomenon were reported on treatment in 
these subjects. 
In long-term study 201, a review of 14 subjects overall with a reported medical history of Raynaud’s 
phenomenon, no events of Raynaud’s phenomenon were reported on treatment in these subjects. One 
(0.1%) subject in the long-term, open-label safety study 201 reported an on-treatment AE of Raynaud’s 
phenomenon  (verbatim  term:  worsening  of  Raynaud’s),  moderate  in  intensity,  on  Study  Day  246. 
Raynaud’s phenomenon was not reported in the medical history for the subject. 
One (0.3%) subject in the rimegepant group and 2 (0.5%) subjects in the placebo group of study 305 
had a reported medical history of Raynaud’s phenomenon. No events of Raynaud’s phenomenon were 
reported on treatment in these subjects in the double-blind or open-label phases of study 305. 
Liver Function Tests 
Across the single-dose studies, there was a low frequency of on-treatment LFT elevations. The frequency 
of elevations was similar between the rimegepant group and the placebo group.

In the long-term, open-label safety study 201, on-treatment LFT elevations above the ULN were reported 
as follows: ALT: 9.0%; AST: 6.8%; ALT or AST: 11.1%; total bilirubin levels (TBL): 1.7%; and Alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP): 3.6%.

Table 58: On-treatment Liver Function Test Elevations: Treated Subjects in the Long-term, 
Open-label Safety Study Supporting the Acute Treatment of Migraine (BHV3000-201) 
Low frequencies of aminotransferase elevations were observed in prevention study 305. As reviewed by 
a panel of external clinical hepatic experts, there were no Hy’s Law cases, and there was no signal of 
drug induced liver injury (DILI) due to rimegepant when administered at least EOD for up to 64 weeks 
of treatment. 
During the DBT phase, there was a low frequency of on-treatment LFT elevations, which were comparable 
between the rimegepant group (n = 363 subjects with LFT data) and the placebo group (n = 358 subjects 
with LFT data). On-treatment ALT or AST elevations > ULN were reported in 31 (8.5%) subjects in the 
rimegepant group and 43 (12.0%) subjects in the placebo group.

External Hepatic Expert Panel Assessment 
A panel of external hepatic experts assessed LFT results from the clinical programme, as well as individual 
liver cases of special interest, for the likelihood of DILI due to rimegepant. Cases from the pivotal Phase 
2/3 migraine prophylaxis study 305; long-term, open-label safety study 201; and the Phase 3, single-
dose, placebo-controlled studies 301 and 303 were assessed by the panel. The criteria to identify cases 
of interest for the panel’s review included the following: aminotransferase laboratory values > 3 x ULN, 
ALP > 2 x ULN, TBL > 2 x ULN, or AEs of cirrhosis, hepatitis, liver failure, or jaundice. 
As of 02-Oct-2020, the external hepatic expert panel has assessed 55 cases from study 201 (29 cases), 
study 305 (24 cases), and the single-dose studies 301 and 303 (1 case each). The panel concluded that 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 107/135

the likelihood of DILI due to rimegepant was unlikely for 47 of the cases, and possible for 8 of the cases. 
All cases reviewed by the panel were assessed as unlikely related to study drug. There were no Hy’s Law 
cases identified by the panel. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Observations 
In long-term study 201, approximately 20% of subjects had on-treatment SBP or DBP or heart rate (HR) 
abnormalities during the study. The on-treatment vital sign and physical abnormalities were generally 
more  frequent  in  the  PRN  groups  than  the  Scheduled  EOD  +  PRN  group,  likely  reflecting  the  longer 
duration of the LTT period in the PRN enrolment groups.

Abnormalities: Treated Subjects in the Phase 2/3 Long-term, Open-label Safety Study 
Supporting the Acute Treatment of Migraine (BHV3000-201) 
Hypersensitivity 
Anaphylactic reaction and rash were reported in 1 (0.1%) subject in the rimegepant group in 303 study.  
In long-term safety study 201, hypersensitivity was reported as an AE in 4 (0.2%) subjects. 
Overdose

In the long-term, open-label safety study 201, subjects were dispensed 30 open-label tablets that can 
be used PRN to treat migraine. In addition, a separate group received scheduled EOD dosing, as well as 
having  the  ability  to  dose  PRN  on  non-scheduled  dosing  days.  During  long-term  and  frequent 
administration, no pattern of AEs suggestive of potential drug abuse was identified. 
Overall,  the  pattern  of  usage  during  the  treatment  period  was  consistent  with  the  subjects’  historical 
frequency  of  migraine  on  entry  to  the  study.  At  study  entry,  the  mean  subject-reported  history  of 
moderate to severe migraine was 5.0 per month in the PRN (2-8) group, 10.0 per month in the PRN (9-
14) group, and 6.0 per month in the Scheduled EOD + PRN group. During the OP, the mean number of 
MDs per 4 weeks for moderate to severe migraine was 5.1 days in the PRN (2-8) group, 9.3 days in the 
PRN (9-14) group, and 6.5 days in the Scheduled EOD + PRN group. Overall, during the LTT, the mean 
number of MDs per 4 weeks for moderate to severe migraine was 5.2 days in the PRN (2-8) group, 8.4 
days in the PRN (9-14) group, and 4.3 days in the Scheduled EOD + PRN group. In the PRN groups, 
subjects were instructed they could self-administer rimegepant PRN up to once per calendar day to treat 
migraine of any severity. Mean average rimegepant exposure (tablets per 4 weeks) during treatment 
with rimegepant PRN was consistent with the number of MDs reported (PRN [2-8]: 5.6 tablets; PRN [9-
14]: 8.5 tablets). In this setting of subject access to 30 tablets of rimegepant per month for up to 52 
weeks, there has been no signal suggestive of misuse, overuse, or abuse of rimegepant. No pattern of 
usage suggestive of euphoric effects or abuse was observed. 
A total of 35 (1.9%) subjects in the long-term, open-label safety study (BHV3000-201) were reported 
as having taken > 1 tablet/day on any day with no pattern of associated AEs. Accidental overdose was 
reported as an AE in 4 (0.2%) subjects. In each instance, the subject took up to a total of 2 rimegepant 
tablets in 1 calendar day. 
Drug Abuse 
Potential drug abuse AEs were monitored in subjects with migraine treated with rimegepant 75 mg in 
the long-term, open-label safety study 201 and prevention study 305. The types and frequency of on-
treatment  AEs  categorised  as  associated  with  potential  drug  abuse  were  generally  consistent  across 
enrolment  groups  of  study  201.  The  most  frequently  reported  on-treatment  AEs  categorised  as 
associated with potential drug abuse (≥ 1% of subjects overall) were fatigue (1.4%) and somnolence 
(1.3%). MoH (reported as verbatim term of rebound headaches; considered possibly related to study 
drug) was reported for 1 (0.1%) subject in study 201. 
In the pivotal Phase 2/3 migraine prophylaxis study 305, no potential drug abuse AEs were reported in 
≥  1%  of  the  subjects  treated  with  rimegepant.  The  most  frequently  reported  on-treatment  potential 
drug  abuse  AEs  were  depression  (0.9%),  fatigue  (0.7%),  insomnia  (0.6%),  and  somnolence  (0.4%). 
There were no reports of medication overuse headache among subjects treated with rimegepant in this 
study. One subject had a follow-up potential drug abuse AE of fatigue. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
The effect of rimegepant withdrawal and rebound was not directly studied. No evidence of rebound or 
withdrawal was identified during the follow-up periods of the Phase 3 single-dose studies (301, 302, and 
303), in the long-term, open-label safety study (201), or pivotal Phase 2/3 migraine prophylaxis study 
(305). The only potential drug abuse AEs identified during follow-up in BHV3000-201 were depression, 
irritability, and syncope (each in 1 subject) and fatigue (1 subject) in BHV3000-305. No AEs for PTs in 
the MedDRA SMQ for drug withdrawal were identified across the clinical development programme for the 
acute treatment of migraine or migraine prophylaxis. Withdrawal or rebound effects are not anticipated 
for rimegepant. 
Medication Overuse Headache

During the long-term, open-label 52-week safety study 201 subjects received a bottle with 30 tablets of 
rimegepant  at  each  dispensing  and  could  self-administer  doses  as  often  as  necessary  or  desired,  no 
suggestion of a potential for causing medication overuse headache was identified. An AE of medication 
overuse  headache  (considered  possibly  related  to  study  drug)  was  reported  for  only  1  subject  in  the 
study. Of note, before taking any rimegepant, the subject had rebound headaches, which were reported 
as an AE (PT of MoH) that was mild in intensity. On the same day that the subject took the first dose of 
rimegepant,  the  subject  had  rebound  headaches,  which  were  reported  as  an  AE  (PT  of  medication 
overuse headache) that was moderate in intensity (an increase in intensity from the prior AE).  
Effect on Ability of Drive or Operate Machinery 
In  the  setting  of  acute  treatment  of  migraine  among  the  treated  subjects  in  the  Phase  3  SD  studies 
301/302/303  and  the  long-term,  open-label  safety  study  201,  or  the  setting  of  migraine  prophylaxis 
among rimegepant-treated subjects in the migraine prophylaxis study 305, dizziness and somnolence 
were  reported,  often  in  subjects  taking  concomitant  medications.  These  AEs  were  of  low  frequency, 
occurred at comparable frequencies in the rimegepant and placebo groups, were mostly mild in intensity, 
infrequently led to discontinuation of study drug, and were not reported in follow-up. 
No  dedicated  driving  impairment  study  was  conducted.  Based  on  available  AE  data,  the  applicant 
suggests that no special instructions for effect on ability to drive or operate machinery are required. 
Immunological events 
N/A 
Discontinuation due to AES 
A  total  of  20  (3.0%)  subjects  had  AEs  leading  to  DC  of  rimegepant  in the  double-blind or  open-label 
rimegepant phase of study 305. These 20 subjects included 6 subjects in the rimegepant group who had 
AEs  leading  to  DC  of  rimegepant  during  the  DBT  phase  (excluding  the  event  of  blood  creatinine 
increased), and 14 subjects treated with rimegepant in the open-label phase who had AEs leading to DC. 
Anxiety, depression, nausea, and ALT increased were the only PTs reported in more than 1 subject in 
the DBT and OLE phase (2 [0.3%] subjects each). 
In  long-term  study  201,  on-treatment  AEs  leading  to  DC  of  rimegepant  were  reported  in  48  (2.7%) 
subjects. The frequencies of AEs leading to DC of rimegepant were consistent across enrolment groups. 
The PTs of AEs leading to DC of rimegepant reported in more than 1 subject were: 
•  Dizziness in 5 (0.3%) subjects 
•  ALT increased and AST increased in 3 (0.2%) subjects each 
•  Anxiety, arthralgia, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, constipation, depression, hot flush, 
suicidal ideation, and vertigo in 2 (0.1%) subjects each.

As of 26-Aug-2020, approximately 70,900 patients have been treated. Post-marketing safety is available 
from the Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) Bi-annual Report covering the period from 27-
Feb-2020 through 26-Aug-2020.  
According  to  the  tabulated  overview  of  adverse  drug  reactions,  Drug  ineffective  (115)  in  liaison  with 
Therapeutic effect incomplete (26) were reported most often.  
Gastrointestinal  AEs  known  from  pivotal  trials  were  also  observed  post-marketing  (Nausea:  30, 
Vomiting: 10). AEs potentially indicative of abuse potential were low (Feeling of relaxation: 1, Hangover: 
2, Accidental overdose: 2, Overdose: 4, Off-label use: 6), however, there were 16 reports of Somnolence. 
Events of Hypersensitivity were reported for 6 subjects, 3 of these were categorised as serious. Cases 
of Hypersensitivity add to 16 reports of skin reactions encompassing Angioedema (1), Pruritus (3), Rash 
(4), Urticaria (2) and others. 
2.8.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data were analysed in pooled groups of Phase 2 and 3 single-dose (301, 302, 303) and multiple-
dose (201, 305) studies in subjects with migraine who were treated with rimegepant 75 mg or placebo. 
Also,  safety  data  were  evaluated  in  healthy  subjects  receiving  rimegepant  doses  ranging  from  single 
doses of 25 mg through 1,500 mg, multiple-dose regimens of up to 600 mg QD for 14 days, or 300 mg 
twice daily for up to 14 days. 
Exposure 
The  safety  database  comprises  a  total  of  N=4,628  unique  treated  subjects  receiving  either  single  or 
multiple doses of rimegepant throughout the clinical development programme. These include a total of 
527 subjects receiving rimegepant (EOD or EOD + PRN up to QD) for at least 6 months, and 311 subjects 
receiving rimegepant for at least 1 year. The OLE period of study 305 was ongoing at the time of dossier 
submission  and  has  reached  its  final  database  lock  on  23-April-2021.  The  minimum  requirements  for 
drug exposure as specified per ICH E1 Guidance are fulfilled. 
Demographics 
At screening, subjects were identified that present with a contraindication to triptan use. These were 
not per se excluded from single or multiple attack studies. Contraindications to triptans mainly concern 
CV safety. However, patients with uncontrolled, unstable or recently diagnosed CV disease, such as 
ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, cerebral ischemia, MI, acute coronary syndrome 
etc. were excluded from 301/302/303/305. Hence, there is large overlap between the CV 
contraindications to triptans and the CV study exclusion criteria, which explains the low portion (0.4-
1.2%) of subjects with apparent contraindications to triptans, but eligibility for studies 301/302/303. 
The applicant will conduct a PASS of Rimegepant in Patients with Migraine and a History of 
Cardiovascular Diseases to further characterise this population.  
Subjects  with  general  risk  factors  for  CV  disease  that  did  not  contraindicate  triptan  use  (e.g.  family 
history of coronary artery disease, treatment for hypertension, current smoker, treatment with a statin, 
or history of diabetes) were included in rimegepant trials. No upper limit of age was defined. The mean 
age of study participants was around 40 years. The subgroup of subjects > 65 years of age was small, 
around 2-3% in SD studies and 5.8% in prevention study 305. MoH is common among severely affected 
patients  requiring  prophylactic  migraine  medication.  The  portion  of  subjects  with  existing  MoH  at  the 
entry of long-term studies 201 and 305 is unclear. Subjects with MoH were initially excluded both from 
study 305 and 201. However, in study 201 this restriction was removed with revised Protocol V2.0. In 
study  305,  22.7%  of  subjects  presented  with  a  history  of  CM  after  implementation  of  Protocol 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 111/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
 
Amendment 4, which widened the entry criteria to also include CM. Given the high overlap between CM 
and MoH, there is a degree of uncertainty with regard to MoH among recruited subjects.  
Adverse events – acute treatment 
The applicant specifies on-treatment AEs as those occurring from the study drug first dose through the 
study  drug  last  dose  plus  7  days  and  differentiates  on-treatment  AEs  from  treatment-emergent  AEs 
(defined as those occurring, worsening, or becoming serious during treatment relative to pre-treatment). 
This distinction was not expected and is not considered to contribute to easy overview of summarised 
safety data. Given the overlap between on-treatment AEs and TEAEs, similar findings were made. The 
overall  rate  of  on-treatment  AEs  was  low  in  pooled  single  dose  phase  3  studies  supporting  the  acute 
treatment of migraine attacks (rimegepant 10.8%, placebo 8.6%). The low frequency of on-treatment 
AEs  in  acute  migraine  treatment  is  to  be  seen  in  the  context  of  the  short  intervention  of  single  dose 
administration in studies 301/302/303. Nausea occurred most often (rimegepant 1.2%, placebo 0.8%), 
followed by urinary tract infections (rimegepant 0.8%, placebo 0.3%). 
On-treatment AEs were reported considerably more often in the acute treatment setting of long-term 
study 201 (PRN 2-8 and PRN 9-14 enrolment groups, up to 52 weeks LTT) than in single dose studies 
301/302/303.  With  regard  to  the  nature  of  reported  PTs,  there  was  large  overlap  between the  single 
dose and PRN (as needed) dosing scheme. In PRN groups of study 201, a mean number of 5.6 (PRN2-
8),  resp.  8.5  (PRN9-14)  rimegepant  doses  were  applied  per  28-day  dosing  interval.  In  both  clinical 
settings, urinary tract infections, and nausea were among most often reported PTs. On-treatment AEs 
related  to  study  drug  in  long-term  study  201  comprise  mainly  unspecific  AEs  like  nausea  (1.3%), 
constipation (1.1%), diarrhoea (0.4%), dizziness (1.5%). somnolence (1.1%). 
The frequency of reported hepatic enzyme increases were low (0.3% in single attack studies both in the 
rimegepant and placebo group). The acute treatment safety database does not point to any increased 
suicidality related to rimegepant based on S-STS testing. 
Rimegepant  is  not  assumed  to  penetrate  the  blood  brain  barrier  in  humans  in  relevant  quantities. 
Nonclinical data indicate rimegepant did not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in rats after daily oral 
doses of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg for 14 days (brain-to-plasma ratio of 0.02 to 0.19) at 24 hours after 
the last dose. The list of nervous system-related on-treatment AEs in study 201 does not point to AEs 
particularly indicative of abuse liability, like e.g. feeling high, euphoria etc. Dizziness ranks highest with 
2.5%  (PRN2-8)  resp.  2.7%  (PRN9-14)  subjects  being  affected.  There  were  4  cases  of  accidental 
overdose, all concerned exceeding the maximum daily dose of 1 rimegepant tablet per day by 1 further 
tablet. In 3 out of 4 cases this happened only once in the course of LTT. Safety analysis of acute migraine 
treatment with rimegepant does not point to abuse liability. 
Adverse events – prophylactic treatment 
Both in the 12-week EOD + PRN of study 201 and the prophylactic EOD dosing setting of study 305, the 
frequency  of  on-treatment  AEs  was  low.  During  the  12-week  DBT  period  of  study  305,  the  overall 
frequency of any on-treatment AE was comparable between the rimegepant (35.9%) and placebo arm 
(35.8%). Also, the nature of on-treatment AEs was similar between acute as-needed and prophylactic 
EOD  dosing.  In  both  clinical  settings,  nausea  and  infections  of  the  urinary  tract  were  observed  most 
often.  Overall  figures  of  on-treatment  AEs  were  low  (EOD  rimegepant  DBT  study  305:  nausea  2.7%, 
nasopharyngitis 3.5%, urinary tract infection 2.4%, upper respiratory tract infection 2.2%), pointing to 
a favourable safety profile of rimegepant. 
A  wide  spectrum  of  PTs  was  screened  to  check  for  any  signal  pointing  to  potential  abuse  liability  of 
rimegepant under EOD dosing conditions. CNS-related PTs were reported at low frequencies and point 
to a low degree of CNS depressant effects of rimegepant (e.g. depressed level of consciousness, memory 
impairment,  lethargy,  somnolence,  confusional  state  etc.  [0.1  –  0.4%]).  No  PTs  were  reported  like 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 112/135

euphoria or feeling high. There is no signal of potential abuse liability of rimegepant under prophylactic 
EOD dosing conditions. 
Safety data obtained from prevention study 305 did not point to an increased rate of CV AEs resulting 
from EOD rimegepant dosing. It is reminded, however, that the population of prevention study 305 was 
young (mean age 41.3 years) with only a small minority of subjects > 65 years of age (5.8%). Patients 
with a current evidence of uncontrolled, unstable, or recently diagnosed CV disease were excluded from 
pivotal rimegepant studies. 
One  case  of  ischaemic  colitis  was  reported  as  SAE  in  a  RGP-treated  subject  in  study  201.Given  the 
theoretical  plausibility  of  CGRP  antagonism  impacting  ischaemic  events,  ischaemic  colitis  should  be 
monitored post-marketing. 
The overall rate of AEs leading to study discontinuation was low during the 12-week DBT period of study 
305 (rimegepant: 1.9%, placebo 1.1%). No particular pattern of safety signal can be discerned. No PT 
was recorded by more than one single subject. Combined analysis of DBT and the subsequent 52-week 
OLE period reveals that AEs leading to discontinuation primarily occurred within the first 6 months of 
treatment. 
Gastrointestinal disorders as AEs of special interest 
On-treatment AEs related to GI disorders were summarised as requested during EMA SA. The overall 
frequency of GI AEs was not high. Irrespective of the single dose setting (studies 301/302/303), PRN 
dosing over up to 52 weeks in study 201, or EOD during the 12-week DBT period of prevention study 
305, nausea (1.5-2.8%) was reported most often, followed by diarrhoea (1.9-1.6%) and constipation 
(1.6-1.1%) after multiple dose administration. 
Raynaud’s phenomenon 
Subjects  with  a  medical  history  of  Raynaud’s  Syndrome  were  not  a  priori  excluded  from  rimegepant 
clinical trials. Being a CGRP antagonist, there is the theoretical possibility that the inhibition of CGRP-
mediated vasodilation could negatively affect existing or precipitate Raynaud symptoms associated with 
vasoconstriction.  However,  in  the  low  number  of  subjects  with  a  Raynaud  history  no  worsening  or 
precipitation of respective symptoms was observed. 
Liver enzyme elevations - hepatotoxicity 
A  dedicated  analysis  of  liver  enzyme  elevations  and  associated  hepatotoxicity  in  patients  receiving 
rimegepant was conducted to address concerns about potential hepatotoxic effects that were observed 
in other previously developed CGRP antagonist and lead to termination of their clinical study programme. 
With  regard  to  drug  exposure,  most  meaningful  data  are  obtained  from  the12-week  DBT  period  of 
prevention study 305 (rimegepant: N=370), its subsequent 52-week OLE phase, and the 12-week open-
label  EOD+PRN  enrolment  group  (N=286)  of  long-term  safety  study  201.  LFT  results  from  the 
programme, as well as individual cases of aminotransferase elevations > 3 x ULN, ALP > 2 x ULN, or 
AEs of cirrhosis, hepatitis, liver failure, or jaundice were reviewed by a panel of external clinical hepatic 
experts. There were no reported elevations of ALT or AST  > 3  x ULN  with concurrent TBL > 2  x ULN 
among subjects treated with rimegepant in the double-blind or open-label phase. No cases of Hy’s Law 
have been identified, and there was no signal of DILI due to rimegepant when administered at least EOD 
for up to 64 weeks of treatment or up to once daily PRN for up to 52 weeks of treatment. Given the low 
number of hepatic –related AEs, it is concluded that, based on available clinical data, there is no evidence 
of hepatotoxicity with the acute (PRN, as needed) or EOD preventive use of rimegepant 75 mg. However, 
relevant elevations of ALT or AST (study 305 DBT or OLE: > ULN: 20.9%), TBL (> ULN: 3.2%) and ALP 
(>  ULN:  10.0%)  were  observed  both  in  pivotal  migraine  studies  and  in  PK/PD  studies  with  healthy 
volunteers.

EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
Vital signs 
Recordings  of  vital  sign  abnormalities  (categorical  BP,  HR  recordings  beyond  pre-defined  thresholds) 
were  provided.  However,  these  do not inform  about  the  actual  effect of  rimegepant  on  vital  signs,  in 
particular when there is no placebo control and no temporal association between vital sign measurement 
(201/305: every 4 weeks) and as-needed administration of study medication (201). Meaningful data on 
the  impact  of  rimegepant  may  be  obtained  from  dedicated  pharmacology  studies  systematically 
recording  BP  /  HR  changes  after  rimegepant  dosing.  Vital  signs  (BP,  HR)  were  recorded  in  temporal 
relation to RPG administration in PK study CN170001 and QTc study 109. As part of pharmacology study 
BHV3000-109, changes in HR post-dose were measured at numerous time points. No clinically relevant 
changes in HR were observed as compared to placebo. Measurement of BP was less frequent. Recordings 
of  BP  pre-dose  were  compared  at  one  time  point  3h-4h  post-dose  only.  Again,  no  clinically  relevant 
changes  in  BP  were  found  in  healthy  volunteers  after  75  mg  rimegepant  administration  in  QTc  study 
BHV3000-109. 
Drug abuse 
No  signal  suggestive  of  misuse,  overuse,  or  abuse  of  rimegepant  was  reported  with  long-term 
administration in the long-term, open-label safety study 201 or prevention study 305 in subjects with 
migraine. 
Withdrawal and rebound 
Potential withdrawal of rimegepant resp. rebound of increased migraine attack frequency after abrupt 
cessation of longer term EOD preventive dosing of rimegepant was not monitored during follow-up of 
studies 201 and 305. However, PTs potentially indicative of withdrawal (e.g. irritability) were observed 
only very rarely (1/1693 of follow-up patients). 
Medication overuse headache 
The  portion  of  subjects  with  existing  MoH  at  the  entry  of  studies  201/305  is  unclear.  Since  MoH  is 
commonly  encountered  among  patients  requiring  migraine  preventive  medication,  the  IHS  Guidance 
does not recommend to exclude MoH patients, but to stratify accordingly. MoH is widespread across a 
variety of headache medications with different modes of action. The liability of orally administered CGRP 
antagonist  rimegepant  as  another  type  of  drug  contributing  to  the  development  of  MoH  cannot  be 
evaluated on the present clinical database. It is also to be taken into account that the dosing interval of 
48  hours  proposed  for  migraine  prevention  is  derived  from  acute  migraine  data  of  sustained  efficacy 
from  2-48 hours  post-dose.  Since  MoH is  widespread  across  all  types of  specific  and  unspecific acute 
migraine medications, standard warnings on MoH need to be introduced in the label. 
Post-marketing data 
Rimegepant was approved for the treatment of acute migraine attacks in the US on 27-Feb-2020. Post-
marketing safety data are available from the Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) Bi-annual 
Report covering the period from 27-Feb-2020 through 26-Aug-2020 covering about 70.000 subjects that 
have treated acute migraine attacks with rimegepant during the first 6 months of marketing in the US. 
According  to  the  tabulated  overview  of  adverse  drug  reactions,  Drug  ineffective  (115)  in  liaison  with 
therapeutic effect incomplete (26) were reported most often. GI AEs known from pivotal trials were also 
observed post-marketing (nausea: 30, vomiting: 10). AEs potentially indicative of abuse potential were 
low  (feeling  of  relaxation:  1,  hangover:  2,  accidental  overdose:  2,  overdose:  4,  off-label  use:  6), 
however, there were 16 reports of somnolence. Events of hypersensitivity were reported for 6 subjects, 
3  of  these  were  categorised  as  serious.  Cases  of  hypersensitivity  add  to  16  reports  of  skin  reactions 
encompassing angioedema (1), pruritus (3), rash (4), urticaria (2) and others.

2.8.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The clinical safety profile of rimegepant in the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine is obtained 
from N=4,628 unique treated subjects receiving either single or multiple doses throughout the clinical 
development programme. By the entirety of available data, the safety profile of the orally administered 
CGRP antagonist rimegeapnt is considered rather favourable. On-treatment AEs related to study drug in 
long-term study 201 comprise mainly unspecific AEs like nausea (1.3%), constipation (1.1%), diarrhoea 
(0.4%), dizziness (1.5%). somnolence (1.1%). The first PBRER covering the first 6 months of marketing 
in the US (acute migraine indication) confirms findings based on the clinical trial data package. These 
include rather modest efficacy on the one side and overall good tolerability on the other side.

2.10.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.10.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.10.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with  the  international  birth  date  (IBD).  The  IBD  is  27  February  2021.  The  new  EURD  list  entry  will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.11.  Product information 
2.11.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.11.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Vydura  (rimegepant)  is  included  in  the 
additional monitoring list as it includes new active substance.   
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Migraine  is  a  serious,  chronic,  disabling  neurological  disease  characterised  by  attacks  of  moderate  to 
severe  headache  pain  associated  with  other  symptoms  such  as  nausea,  vomiting,  photophobia,  and 
phonophobia. Migraine attacks typically last from 4 to 72 hours if untreated or unsuccessfully treated. 
People with migraine may experience an aura prior to the onset of their headache. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to current treatment guidelines, unspecific analgesics like acetylic acid, ibuprofen, paracetamol 
etc. rank among first-line therapies, however, are typically used for less severe migraine attacks. Major 
progress in more specific treatment of acute migraine symptoms was achieved with the advent of the 
triptans in the nineties. Triptans target 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors and their mechanism is thought 
to involve cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release (Rizatriptan 
SmPC). As the gold standard for acute treatment of migraine, they represent 28% to 36% of prescribed 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 118/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
 
acute migraine medications (Mafi et al. 2015; Molina et al. 2018). However, triptans are not efficacious 
for all patients: the main efficacy benchmark, i.e. the rates of pain freedom at 2 hours post-dose with 
triptans are in the range of 20% to 40% (Ferrari et al. 2002). Furthermore, efficacy and tolerability vary, 
both between agents (7 triptans approved so far), and from patient to patient. 
Although forming the mainstay of current acute migraine therapy, it is concluded that around 30% of 
patients  fail  to  respond  to  a  particular  triptan  (Dodick  DW  2005).  The  reasons  therefore  are  not  fully 
understood  and  may  include  inter-  and  intra-individual  attack  variability,  on  top  of  other  factors 
modifying responsiveness, like e.g. concomitant use of preventive medication, MoH, inadequate dosing, 
the  time  point  of  medication  intake  relative  to  the  onset  of  the  attack,  incomplete  absorption  due  to 
concomitant gastric stasis or vomiting, presence resp. absence of aura symptoms etc. (Viana M 2013). 
Furthermore, the use of the triptans is limited with regard to their CV risk profile.  
The inclusion criteria of rimegepant’s RCTs specify that subjects with contraindications to triptans may 
be eligible, provided they meet all other study entry criteria. Contraindications to triptans mainly concern 
CV  safety.  However,  patients  with  uncontrolled,  unstable  or  recently  diagnosed  CV  disease,  such  as 
ischemic  heart  disease,  coronary  artery  vasospasm,  cerebral  ischemia,  MI,  acute  coronary  syndrome 
etc.  were  excluded  from  rimegepant  trials.  It  remains  therefore  unclear  which  patients  with  existing 
contraindications  to  triptans  would  actually  be  eligible  for  treatment  with  rimegepant.  There  is  no 
statement in the proposed rimegepant SmPC highlighting or claiming a potential advantage of RGP as 
compared to triptans in terms of the CV risk profile. Since rimegepant is not vasoconstrictive and the CV 
risk profile appears favourable, no CV contraindications were labelled for rimegepant. 
As concerns migraine prophylaxis, the range of available oral treatment options (ß-blockers, topiramate, 
antidepressants  etc.)  most  recently  was  complemented  by  ABs  (so-called  biologicals)  targeting 
circulating  CGRP  or  its  receptor  (erenumab,  fremanezumab,  galcanezumab).  These  ABs  are  injected 
following 4-week, resp. 12-week dosing intervals. Compliance is a well documented problem in migraine 
preventive  therapy.  The  extended  dosing  intervals  of  the  biologicals  may  therefore  be  interpreted  as 
beneficial by increasing compliance of the patients. Irrespective of the compliance aspect, the applicant 
claims potential advantages for RGP as a needle-free treatment option, that avoids polypharmacy (by 
offering acute and preventive treatment with one substance) and allows flexible treatment if immediate 
cessation of therapy is required, e.g. in case a serious AE or pregnancy. 
Overall,  in  view  of  incomplete  response  to  currently  available  acute  migraine medications  on  the  one 
side and limitations to their use due to CV safety concerns on the other side, there is a general need for 
new therapeutic approaches in acute migraine therapy. Based on its pharmacological profile as an orally 
administered CGRP antagonist and the assumed absence of any vasoconstrictive properties, RGP may 
potentially constitute a valuable contribution to currently available migraine therapeutics. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical dossier of rimegepant includes efficacy data from two separate sets of clinical studies that 
were provided for the acute (single attack studies 301 [N=1.084] / 302 [N=1.072] / 303 [N=1.351]) 
and  preventive  treatment  (study  305  [N=695])  of  migraine  under  randomised,  placebo-controlled 
conditions.  In  terms  of  baseline  demographics  of  acute  migraine  studies,  the  mITT  population  is 
considered as typically representative of the migraine target population in terms of age (mean of 40-42 
years, 96.8% < 65 years), gender (85-89% female), history of migraine with aura (30-37%), and the 
portion of subjects receiving preventive medication (13-17%). At screening, about one third of subjects 
was currently using triptans for the treatment of acute attacks. The mean duration of migraine history 
is about 20 years at study entry. The median number of moderate to severe migraine attacks per month 
is 4.0 across treatment arms. The majority of subjects is considered moderately to severely affected by 
the disease. 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 119/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
Supportive data include phase 2b dose-ranging study CN170003 ([N=811], with capsule) establishing 
rimegepant 75 mg as the minimum effective dose, and a phase 2/3, open-label, long-term safety study 
where subjects could receive rimegepant 75 mg doses for up to 52 weeks (201 [N=1.800]). All studies 
were conducted in the US. 
The most relevant efficacy endpoints in single attack studies 301/302/303 are adequately chosen and 
are in line with guideline provisions. These include pain resp. MBS freedom at 2 hours post-dose (co-
primary), sustained freedom from pain / MBS from 2-24 or 2-48 hours post-dose, and pain relief at early 
assessment time points.  
An active control arm was not included in prevention study 305. Large and highly variable placebo effects 
have been observed in past migraine prevention trials. Therefore, placebo control is indispensable. An 
active control arm would have provided added information to contextualize the clinical effect of the test 
medication, however, is not considered essential from the regulatory perspective. Throughout the 12-
wk double blind treatment period, subjects had to treat acute attacks (if any occurred) using their usual 
standard medication, i.e. PRN rimegepant was not allowed. On the contrary, during the subsequent 1-
year  open-label  extension  (OLE)  period  (wk  13-64)  PRN  rimegepant  could  be  used  in  case  an  acute 
migraine attack occurred. However, a MDD of 75 mg rimegepant had to be observed, i.e. PRN rimegepant 
could  only  be  taken  on  days  for  which  every-other-day  (EOD)  rimegepant  for  prevention  was  not 
scheduled. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of study 305 was the change from the OP in the mean number of migraine 
days (MD) per month in the last month (Weeks 9 to 12) of the DBT phase. A migraine day was defined 
along the IHS guidance provisions for an EM population, i.e. as a day with headache lasting at least 30 
minutes without intake of analgesics and meeting ICHD-3 criteria for migraine or probable migraine. 
Subjects  included  in  prevention  study  305  were  severely  affected  by  the  disease  and  experienced  a 
median  number  of  8.0  migraine  attacks  per  month  with  a  portion  of  12.9%  subjects  suffering  >  12 
attacks per month. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
High rate of study completion 
In  terms  of  subject  disposition,  study  completion  was  very  high  across  the  3  single  attack  studies 
301/302/303 and dose arms (around 99% for rimegepant 75 mg and placebo), which does not surprise, 
given the shortness of intervention. Equally, a high portion of subjects completed the 12-week double-
blind  treatment  period  of  prevention  study  305  (84.5%,  equally  distributed  across  arms:  rimegepant 
85.4%, placebo 83.6%). Only very few subjects discontinued due to AE on DBT or subsequent OLE period 
(n=13 [3.5%] rimegepant, n=5 [1.7%] placebo patients). About equal portions of subjects continued to 
the OLE phase after terminating the DBT period (rimegepant: 81.6%, placebo: 81.4%). 
Co-primaries in acute studies: Effects significant, but modest 
Across the 3 pivotal single attack studies, superiority over placebo could consistently be shown for both 
co-primary  endpoints,  i.e.  portions  of  patients  achieving  pain  freedom  resp.  MBS  freedom  at  2  hours 
post-dose.  
Secondaries in acute studies: Modest effects, partly significant due to hierarchical testing 
A multitude of secondary efficacy endpoints were tested hierarchically in studies 301, 302. In line with 
EMA Guideline provisions, demonstration of sustained freedom of pain from 2-24 hours and/or from 2-
48  hours  post-dose  were  included.  Across  all  single  attack  studies,  numerical differences  in  favour  of 
RGP could be shown (risk difference (%) / p-values: pain freedom 2-24 hour: 301: 5.86 / 0.002, 302: 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 120/135

5.19 / 0.004, 303: 10.12 / <.0001*; pain freedom 2-48 hour: 301: 4.39 / 0.013, 302: 3.89 / 0.018, 
303:  8.02  /  <.0001*).  Due  to  hierarchical  testing,  however,  statistical  superiority  over  placebo  could 
only be shown for sustained pain freedom in study 303. 
A multitude of secondary efficacy endpoints were tested hierarchically in studies 301 and 302. Freedom 
of  associated  symptoms  (photophobia,  phonophobia,  nausea)  was  placed  high  in  the  hierarchy.  After 
statistical significance could not be shown for freedom from nausea at 2 post-dose, all endpoints listed 
afterwards in the hierarchy were not considered statistically significant in either study. From the CHMP’s 
perspective, there was no imminent necessity to arrange the hierarchical order of testing the secondary 
endpoints  in  the  way  it  was  conducted  in  studies  301/302.  In  study  303,  the  hierarchical  order  was 
modified. In line with EMA Guideline provisions, demonstration of sustained freedom of pain from 2-24 
hours  and/or  from  2-48  hours  post-dose  are  considered  meaningful  endpoints.  In  line  with  results 
obtained for the co-primary endpoints, net differences over placebo were modest for sustained effect-
related  endpoints.  However,  across  all  single  attack  studies,  numerical  differences  in  favour  of 
rimegepant could be shown (risk difference (%) / p-values: pain freedom 2-24 hr: 301: 5.86 / 0.002, 
302: 5.19 / 0.004, 303: 10.12 / <.0001*; pain freedom 2-48 hr: 301: 4.39 / 0.013, 302: 3.89 / 0.018, 
303:  8.02  /  <.0001*).  Due  to  hierarchical  testing,  however,  statistical  superiority  over  placebo  could 
only be shown for sustained pain freedom in study 303. 
Reduction of MDs in prevention 
In terms of migraine prevention, subjects receiving prophylactic EOD 75 mg rimegepant tablets reduced 
the mean number of MDs by -4.3, as opposed placebo subjects who achieved a reduction of MDs by -
3.5 days throughout the last 4 weeks (week 9-12) of the DBT (primary GLMEM analysis; difference = -
0.8 days; p=0.0099). In the analysis applying jump to reference targeting the treatment policy estimand, 
which  was  provided  as  sensitivity  analysis,  the  net  difference  between  RGP  and  placebo  in  evaluable 
mITT subjects in terms of MD reduction throughout the last 4 weeks (week 9-12) of the DBT is diminished 
to -0.7 MDs but still statistically significant (p=0.0400). 
Although statistical superiority over placebo could be demonstrated (p=.0099) using the primary GLMEM 
analysis, the net difference of 0.8 MD per month is considered modest. Furthermore, the applied GLMEM 
analysis is not considered as the analysis that targets the effect of primary regulatory interest. The jump 
to referene analysis targeting the treatment policy estimand, which was provided as sensitivity analysis, 
is considered as the adequate analysis. If the sensitivity analysis Jump-to-Reference is applied, the net 
difference  between  rimegepant  and  placebo  in  evaluable  mITT  subjects  in  terms  of  MD  reduction 
throughout the last 4 weeks (wk 9-12) of the DBT is further diminished to -0.7 MDs (p=0.0400). 
Maintenance of effect 
The mean number of MDs per month during the initial OP of study 305 was 9.9 MDs/month (10.1 MDs 
in previous rimegepant patients during DBT, 9.6 in placebo subjects). The major part of MD reduction 
was  then  achieved  during  the  subsequent  12-week  DBT.  Nonetheless,  the  mean  number  of  MDs  per 
month  continued to  decline  throughout the  52-week  OLE  period  from  a  mean of  4.6  MDs  at  Month  1 
(N=548) to 2.7 MDs at Month 13 (N=420). Thereby, maintenance of effect is shown over one year with 
OL regular EOD dosing plus PRN rimegepant on non-scheduled days. However, it has to be taken into 
account that in the course of the OLE the population progressively contains study completers, likely to 
be responders, while other subjects already discontinued. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Despite significant effects that could be shown across pivotal trials in terms of primary endpoints, there 
are  a  number  of  uncertainties  that  mainly  relate  the  magnitude  of  effect,  lack  of  data  (e.g.  to  proof 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 121/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
consistency  of  effect,  no  controlled  data  for  acute  attacks  in  EOD  patients)  and  design-related 
shortcomings of the clinical programme. 
Modest effect size and no proof of consistent effect in acute treatment 
Despite statistical significance, the overall effect size of the 2-hour pain freedom coprimary endpoint is 
rather modest (net risk difference over placebo for 2-hr pain freedom: 301: 4.91%, 302: 7.59%, 303: 
10.37%).  
As concerns the co-primary rate of MBS  freedom at 2-hours post-dose, both rimegepant and placebo 
response rates were higher as compared to response rates for pain freedom. The net risk difference over 
placebo, however, remains modest (net risk difference over placebo for 2-hr MBS freedom: 301: 8.90%, 
302: 12.38%, 303: 8.29%). However modest with regard to the magnitude of the effect size, it is noted 
that  placebo  superiority  could  be  reproduced  in  terms  of  the  two  co-primary  endpoints  across  3 
independent single attack studies. 
Freedom of associated symptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, nausea) was placed high in the hierarchy. 
After statistical significance could not be shown for freedom from nausea at 2 post-dose, all endpoints 
listed afterwards in the hierarchy were not considered statistically significant in either study. From the 
CHMP’s perspective, there was no imminent necessity to arrange the hierarchical order of testing the 
secondary endpoints in the way it was conducted in studies 301/302. In study 303, the hierarchical order 
was modified. In line with results obtained for the co-primary endpoints, net differences over placebo 
were modest for sustained effect-related endpoints (see above).  
The EMA Guideline recommends that single attack studies are supplemented with studies on consistency 
of effect with regard to general variability of migraine attacks. A consistency study 304 across 4 acute 
migraine attacks was originally planned (along EMA guideline provisions) and discussed within the scope 
of EMA SA from May 2018, however, no consistency data were submitted. The lacking proof of consistent 
effect is seen in the context of modest magnitude of effect in acute single attack trials 301/302/303, and 
poor outcome of long term study 201. In the largest PRN(2-8) [N=1023] enrolment group of study 201, 
the mean number of  MDs increased by +0.1 MDs over the 52-week PRN open-label treatment period as 
compared  to  the    OP.  While  concerns  about  long-term  efficacy  underline  the  importance  of  proving 
consistency of effect, a principal distinction is to be made between attrition of effect long term and the 
within-subject approach of demonstrating consistent efficacy according to guideline provisions. 
In  the  absence  of  guideline-conforming  prospective,  placebo-controlled  data  on  within-patient 
consistency in acute migraine, exploratory data obtained from acute migraine treatment during OLE of 
study 305 on unscheduled EOD dosing days were provided post hoc. These provide some insight into 
reproducibility of treatment success in consecutive acute attacks, however, have severe limitations. They 
reflect uncontrolled open-label conditions in patients with maintenance EOD preventive dosing that could 
only take rimegepant for acute migraine on non-scheduled dosing days. A focused analysis in subgroups 
of patients with > 3 moderate to severe MDs (N=350) and those with > 4 MDs (N=310) was provided 
on the first 3 resp. 4 attacks, detailing the number of patients achieving 2-hours pain freedom in 0, 1, 
2, 3, (4) of the first attacks and calculating the portion of subjects achieving pain freedom in at least 2 
out of first 3, resp. 3 out of first 4 attacks. 
The  profile  obtained  largely  corresponds  to  the  modest  treatment  effect  already  observed  across  the 
single attack studies 301/302/303. In both subgroups of patients with > 3, respectively > 4 moderate 
to severe migraine attacks, more than half of patients could not successfully treat a single attack of the 
first  three  resp.  four  attacks  (0  out  of  3:  58.4%;  0  out  of  4:  52.4%).  Only  a  very  small  minority  of 
patients achieved pain freedom at 2 hours post-dose in every single of the first 3 resp. 4 attacks (3 out 
of 3: 5.3%; 4 out of 4: 3.4%).  
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 122/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
As  could  be  expected,  the  magnitude  of  requested  within-patient  consistency  parameter  (2  out  of  3: 
16.5%, resp. 3 out 4: 9.7%) is considerably smaller than the average absolute responder rates observed 
across the three single attack studies 301/302/303 of 19-21% (placebo 10.9 – 14.2%). 
Lack of controlled data to show efficacy on acute attacks in EOD patients 
It  is  inherent  to  claimed  comprehensive  management  of  migraine  that  rimegepant  may  be  taken  as 
needed for acute migraine attacks on top of regular preventive RGP administration. The lack of controlled 
data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of combined acute and prophylactic use of rimegepant is 
considered a major limitation of the present clinical data package. The efficacy of RGP, taken for acute 
migraine  attacks,  was  not  demonstrated  under  placebo-controlled  conditions  in  subjects  already 
receiving regular preventive RGP.  
The lacking proof of efficacy in case of acute attacks in EOD patients adds to concerns about the principal 
design of study 305. A maximum daily dose of 75 mg rimegepant was to be observed. Rescue medication 
(either rimegepant or NSAIDS) could be taken throughout the OLE of study 305 only on days which were 
not scheduled for EOD dosing of preventive rimegepant. It is unclear how restriction of rimegepant to 
be  taken  for  acute  treatment  on  non-scheduled  days  only,  is  compatible  with  clinical  practice,  which 
requires to treat acute attacks whenever they occur, irrespective of EOD dose schedules.  
In order to more closely describe the implications of the proposed EOD+PRN dosing scheme in migraine 
prevention, the applicant was requested to show how remaining MDs and rescue medication use spread 
across scheduled and non-scheduled days during the OLE period of study 305. The results do not indicate 
any substantive difference between scheduled and non-scheduled days in the mean number of remaining 
MDs per month or in the mean number of rescue medication days per month. Remaining MDs were about 
equally  distributed  across  scheduled  and  non-scheduled  days  with  a  mean  of  1.7  days  on  scheduled 
days, and 1.9 on non-scheduled days across the 52-week OLE. The overall open-label mean number of 
rescue medication days per month was 1.3. This was also equally distributed between scheduled days 
(0.7 days) and non-scheduled days (0.7 days). 
Clinical relevance of the effect in migraine prevention 
While  primary  analysis  and  the  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  in  study  305  yielded 
statistically significant differences in the mean number of MDs between RGP and placebo in evaluable 
mITT subjects, the net difference (-0.8 MD in primary analysis and -0.7 in the sensitivity analysis) is 
considered modest.  
In order to more accurately describe the clinical relevance of the net difference over placebo, the change 
of  MDs  from  the  OP  over  the  12-week  DBT  is  to  be  taken  into  account.  During  the  OP,  subjects 
experienced 10.3 (rimegepant) resp. 9.9 (placebo) MDs. In both arms, the number of MDs per 28-day 
assessment  period  decreases  constantly  per  month  throughout  the  12-week  DBT  period.  In  terms  of 
percent reduction, the number of MDs was reduced by -50.3% in rimegepant subjects, while placebo 
subjects  achieved  to  reduce  the  mean  number  of  MDs  from  week  9-12  by  -41.7%.  The  overall  net 
difference of -0.7 MDs per month between rimegepant and placebo corresponds to less than 10% of the 
number of MDs experienced at baseline. 
Subjects  recruited  for  study  305  were  stratified  according  to  concomitant  prophylactic  migraine 
medication.  In  the  subgroup  of  subjects  receiving  concomitant  non-study  migraine  prophylactic 
medication  rimegepant  numerically  hardly  separated  from  placebo.  Subjects  without  concomitant 
preventive treatment reduced MDs to the same degree as observed in the total mITT population of study 
305.  The  impact  of  month-to-month  variability  in  a  relatively  small  group  of  subjects  is  taken  into 
account. However, it is noted that reduction in MDs in prophylactic medication users continues to decline 
from an initial reduction of -1.6 MDs during the first four weeks of DBT, to -0.8 MDs during month 2, 
and finally an increase in mean MDs by 0.1 from week 9-12. 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 123/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
Throughout the 12-week DBT period of study 305, subjects could use their individual rescue medication 
in  case  an  acute  migraine  attack  occurred  despite  preventive  study  medication.  Across  arms  and  the 
three  28-day  treatment  intervals  of  the  DBT,  subjects  used  rescue  on  a  mean  of  about  4-5  days  per 
month. Rimegepant did not significantly separate from placebo in any of the three 28-day intervals of 
the DBT in terms of rescue medication use. 
The  MIDAS  Migraine  Disability  Assessment  score  retrospectively  reflects on how  many  days  a  patient 
was negatively affected by migraine throughout the preceding 3 months period. Baseline mean MIDAS 
scores were 36.9 in the rimegepant group and 35.3 in placebo patients, reflecting that subjects were 
severely  affected  by  the  disease.  Rimegepant  numerically  hardly  separated  from  placebo  in  reducing 
migraine-related disability (MIDAS: rimepgepant: -11.8, placebo -11.7, p=0.9616) during the 12-week 
DBT period. However, the course of MIDAS score changes over the 52-week OLE period of study 305 
provides further reassurance. Meaningful reductions in MIDAS scores were achieved over time (week 24, 
week 64) over the 1-year OLE period of study 305. 
Design of study 305 
Apart from lacking controlled data for efficacy in acute attacks and restriction to administer rimegepant 
on non-scheduled EOD days only, there are further design-related uncertainties about prevention study 
305. 
Handling of EM vs CM sub-populations 
To  be  eligible  for  participation  in  prevention  study  305,  subjects  had  to  present  with  4-18  migraine 
attacks per month, respectively at least 6 MD and not more than 18 headache days. With the 4th of 8 
amendments implemented to the Protocol of study 305, eligibility criteria were expanded to also include 
subjects with CM, which were previously excluded. The number of allowed days per month with headache 
was increased to 18. Hence, the inclusion criteria of study 305 may include both EM and CM patients. 
The applicant did not provide respective IHS codes 1.1, 1.2.1, or 1.3 of included patients.  
Subjects reported at study entry whether there was a history of CM (yes 22.7%) after implementation 
of Protocol Amendment 4. Reported history does not inform about current state. A stratified analysis of 
migraine  prevention  results  in  EM  vs  CM  was  not  pre-specified.  Only  ad  hoc  exploratory  results  are 
presented, not yielding robust effects for the subgroup of “historical CM” in terms of the primary efficacy 
endpoint (Total MD reduction from OP to week 9-12 of DBT). The applicant claimed a broad indication of 
migraine prevention irrespective of EM / CM classification. However, the CM subgroup was too small to 
be able to show any effect independently. Furthermore, data does not allow a precise estimation on the 
treatment effect in this subgroup.  
Evaluable mITT as primary population 
Primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  analysed  using  evaluable  mITT  subjects, i.e.  enrolled 
subjects  who  were  randomised  only  once,  received  at  least  1  dose  of  double-blind  study  medication 
(rimegepant  or  placebo),  and  had  ≥  14  days  of  eDiary  efficacy  data  (not  necessarily  consecutive)  in 
both the OP and at least 1 month (i.e., 4-week interval) in the DBT phase of study 305. The portion of 
subjects not considered mITT evaluable due to less than 14 days of eDiary efficacy data in any of the 3 
treatment months (28 day intervals) was low (rimegepant 5.9%, placebo 6.5%) and equally distributed 
across arms. Based on the EMA-SA (Dec 2018), there were initial concerns about exclusion of subjects 
from the primary efficacy analysis for incomplete eDiary data entry, since the reason for missing post-
baseline  measurements  may  be  related  to  treatment  and/or  to  the  outcome.  However,  sensitivity 
analyses  in  treated  subjects  were  provided  showing  that  calculation  of  the  primary  endpoint  in  the 
evaluable mITT population does not create a bias in favour of rimegepant. 
Definition of MD 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 124/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint of study 305 was the change from the OP in the mean number of migraine 
days (MD) per month in the last month (Weeks 9 to 12) of the DBT phase. In the context of recruiting a 
mixed  of  EM/CM  population  in  study  305,  implications  result  as  concerns  definition  of  a  MD.  The  IHS 
issued two guidance documents for preventive treatment of migraine attacks with different definitions 
(i.e. required duration of the headache is at least 30 minutes for EM while at least 4 hours are required 
for CM). Since reduction from baseline in the mean number of MDs per month in the last 4 weeks of the 
12-week  DBT  period  is  defined  as  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  the  definition  of  a  MD  is  of  critical 
importance.  In  the  present  study  305,  the  sponsor  defined  a  MD  along  the  provisions  for  an  EM 
population.  Given  the  mixed  EM/CM  population  of  study  305,  the  impact  of  the  EM-concordant  MD 
definition on the outcome is unknown.  
Acute  studies:  No  effect  against  nausea  and  implications  for  other  secondary  endpoints  in  studies 
301/302 
Contrary  to  freedom  from  photophobia  and  phonophobia  at  2  hours  post-dose,  for  which  consistent 
superiority over placebo could be shown, rimegepant did not significantly separate from placebo for the 
freedom from nausea as associated symptom. The differential effect of rimegepant, on the associated 
symptoms, photophobia/phonophobia on the one side, and nausea/vomiting on the other side, could be 
explained  by  different  pathophysiological  mechanisms  causing  the  symptoms,  with  the  ones  being 
affected by rimegepant’s CGRP antagonism, while the others aren’t. Additionally, due to the placement 
of effect against nausea on the #3rd order in the hierarchical strategy of secondary endpoints for study 
301 and 302, a statistically significant effect on other secondary endpoints (including regulatory relevant 
endpoints such as sustained pain freedom from 2 to 24 / from 2 to 48 hours post-dose) could not be 
claimed.  
Long-term efficacy in study 201 
Exploratory  efficacy  analysis  of  study  201  demonstrates  that  the  long-term  overall  effect  in  acute 
migraine treatment is modest in the PRN (9-14) group (-0.9 MDs) [N=468]. Virtually no beneficial effect 
was observed in the course of the 52-week open-label treatment period in terms of reduced mean MDs 
per month as compared to OP in the largest enrolment group PRN (2-8) [N=1023] of subjects historically 
experiencing 2-8 attacks per month (+0.1 MDs, by moderate to severe severity). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The overall safety profile of rimegepant appeared favourable. 
Safety database 
The  safety  database  comprises  a  total  of  N=4,628  unique  treated  subjects  receiving  either  single  or 
multiple doses of rimegepant throughout the clinical development programme. These include a total of 
527 subjects receiving rimegepant (EOD or EOD + PRN up to QD) for at least 6 months, and 311 subjects 
receiving rimegepant for at least 1 year. The open-label extension period of study 305 was ongoing at 
the time of dossier submission and has reached its final database lock on 23-April-2021. The minimum 
requirements for drug exposure as specified per ICH E1 Guidance are fulfilled. 
At screening, subjects were identified that present with a contraindication to triptan use. These were not 
per  se  excluded  from  single  or  multiple  attack  studies.  Contraindications  to  triptans  mainly  concern 
cardiovascular  safety.  However,  patients  with  uncontrolled,  unstable  or  recently  diagnosed 
cardiovascular disease, such as ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, cerebral ischemia, 
myocardial Infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome etc. were excluded from 301/302/303/305. Hence, 
there is large overlap between the CV contraindications to triptans and the CV study exclusion criteria, 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 125/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
which explains the low portion (0.4-1.2%) of subjects with apparent contraindications to triptans, but 
eligibility for studies 301/302/303.  
Subjects  with  general  risk  factors  for  CV  disease,  that  did  not  contraindicate  triptan  use  (e.g.  family 
history of coronary artery disease, treatment for hypertension, current smoker, treatment with a statin, 
or history of diabetes) were included in rimegepant trials. No upper limit of age was defined. The mean 
age of study participants was around 40 years.  
Adverse events – acute treatment 
The overall rate of on-treatment AEs was low in pooled single dose phase 3 studies supporting the acute 
treatment of migraine attacks (rimegepant 10.8%, placebo 8.6%). The low frequency of on-treatment 
AEs  in  acute  migraine  treatment  is  to  be  seen  in  the  context  of  the  short  intervention  of  single  dose 
administration in studies 301/302/303. Nausea occurred most often (rimegepant 1.2%, placebo 0.8%), 
followed by urinary tract infections (rimegepant 0.8%, placebo 0.3%). 
With regard to the nature of reported PTs, there was large overlap between the single dose and PRN (as 
needed) dosing scheme. In PRN groups of study 201, a mean number of 5.6 (PRN2-8), resp. 8.5 (PRN9-
14)  rimegepant  doses  were  applied  per  28-day  dosing  interval.  In  both  clinical  settings,  urinary  tract 
infections, and nausea were among most often reported PTs. On-treatment AEs related to study drug in 
long-term study 201 comprise mainly unspecific AEs like nausea (1.3%), constipation (1.1%), diarrhoea 
(0.4%), dizziness (1.5%). somnolence (1.1%). 
The  list  of  nervous  system-related  on-treatment  AEs  in  study  201  does  not  point  to  AEs  particularly 
indicative of abuse liability, like e.g. feeling high, euphoria etc. Dizziness ranks highest with 2.5% (PRN2-
8) resp. 2.7% (PRN9-14) subjects being affected. 
One  case  of  ischaemic  colitis  was  reported  as  SAE  in  a  RGP-treated  subject  in  study  201.  Given  the 
theoretical  plausibility  of  CGRP  antagonism  impacting  ischaemic  events,  ischaemic  colitis  should  be 
monitored post-marketing. 
Adverse events – prophylactic treatment 
Both in the 12-week EOD + PRN of study 201 and the prophylactic EOD dosing setting of study 305, the 
frequency  of  on-treatment  AEs  was  low.  During  the  12-week  DBT  period  of  study  305,  the  overall 
frequency of any on-treatment AE was comparable between the rimegepant (35.9%) and placebo arm 
(35.8%). Also, the nature of on-treatment AEs was similar between acute as-needed and prophylactic 
EOD  dosing.  In  both  clinical  settings,  nausea  and  infections  of  the  urinary  tract  were  observed  most 
often.  Overall  figures  of  on-treatment  AEs  were  low  (EOD  rimegepant  DBT  study  305:  nausea  2.7%, 
nasopharyngitis 3.5%, urinary tract infection 2.4%, upper respiratory tract infection 2.2%), pointing to 
a favourable safety profile of rimegepant. 
No  signal  suggestive  of  misuse,  overuse,  or  abuse  of  rimegepant  was  reported  with  long-term 
administration in the long-term, open-label safety study 201 or prevention study 305 in subjects with 
migraine. 
Through  inhibition  of  vasodilatory  activity  of  CGRP,  rimegepant  may  theoretically  attenuate 
compensatory vasodilation in ischaemia-related conditions. Subjects with a medical history of Raynaud’s 
Syndrome were not a priori excluded from rimegepant clinical trials. There is the theoretical possibility 
that the inhibition of CGRP-mediated vasodilation could negatively affect existing or precipitate Raynaud 
symptoms  associated  with  vasoconstriction.  However,  in  the  low  number  of  subjects  with  a  Raynaud 
history  no  worsening  or  precipitation  of  respective  symptoms  was  observed.  There  were  no  CV  AEs 
reported in the DBT period of study 305. There was 1 case (0.1%) of MI during the OLE in a 60-70 years 
patient with a medical history of CV risks factors.

Post-marketing data 
Rimegepant was approved for the treatment of acute migraine attacks in the US on 27-Feb-2020. Post-
marketing safety data are available from the PBRER Bi-annual Report covering the period from 27-Feb-
2020 through 26-Aug-2020 including about 70.000 subjects that have treated acute migraine attacks 
with rimegepant during the first 6 months of marketing in the US. According to the tabulated overview 
of adverse drug reactions, Drug ineffective (115) in liaison with therapeutic effect incomplete (26) were 
reported  most  often.  AEs  known  from  pivotal  trials  were  also  observed  post-marketing  (nausea:  30, 
vomiting : 10). AEs potentially indicative of abuse potential were low. Events of hypersensitivity were 
reported  for  6  subjects,  3  of  these  were  categorised  as  serious.  Cases  of  hypersensitivity  add  to  16 
reports of skin reactions encompassing angioedema (1), pruritus (3), rash (4), urticaria (2) and others. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Liver enzyme elevations - hepatotoxicity 
A  dedicated  analysis  of  liver  enzyme  elevations  and  associated  hepatotoxicity  in  patients  receiving 
rimegepant was conducted to address concerns about potential hepatotoxic effects that were observed 
in other previously developed CGRP antagonist and lead to termination of their clinical study programme. 
There  were  no  reported  elevations  of  ALT  or  AST  >  3  x  ULN  with  concurrent  TBL  >  2  x  ULN  among 
subjects treated with rimegepant in the double-blind or open-label phase. No cases of Hy’s Law have 
been identified, and there was no signal of DILI due to rimegepant when administered at least EOD for 
up to 64 weeks of treatment or up to once daily PRN for up to 52 weeks of treatment. Given the low 
number of hepatic–related AEs, it is concluded that, based on available clinical data, there is no evidence 
of hepatotoxicity with the acute (PRN, as needed) or EOD preventive use of rimegepant 75 mg. However, 
relevant elevations of ALT or AST (study 305 DBT or OLE: > ULN: 20.9%), TBL (> ULN: 3.2%) and ALP 
(>  ULN:  10.0%)  were  observed  both  in  pivotal  migraine  studies  and  in  PK/PD  studies  with  healthy 
volunteers. 
Vital signs 
Recordings  of  vital  sign  abnormalities  were  provided.  However,  these  do  not  inform  about  the  actual 
effect  of  rimegepant  on  vital  signs,  in  particular  when  there  is  no  placebo  control  and  no  temporal 
association between vital sign measurement (201/305: every 4 weeks) and as-needed administration of 
study  medication  (201).  However,  vital  signs  (BP,  HR)  were  recorded  in  temporal  relation  to  RPG 
administration in PK study CN170001 and QTc study 109. As part of pharmacology study 109, changes 
in  HR  post-dose  were  measured  at  numerous  time  points.  No  clinically  relevant  changes  in  HR  were 
observed  as  compared  to  placebo.  Measurement  of  BP  was  less  frequent.  Recordings  of  BP  pre-dose 
were compared at one time point 3h-4h post-dose only. Again, no clinically relevant changes in BP were 
found in healthy volunteers after 75 mg rimegepant administration in QTc study 109. 
Withdrawal and rebound 
Potential withdrawal of rimegepant resp. rebound of increased migraine attack frequency after abrupt 
cessation of longer term EOD preventive dosing of rimegepant was not monitored during follow-up of 
studies 201 and 305. However, PTs potentially indicative of withdrawal (e.g. irritability) were observed 
only very rarely (1/1693 of follow-up patients). 
Medication overuse headache (MoH) 
Since MoH is commonly encountered among patients requiring migraine preventive medication, the IHS 
Guidance does not recommend to exclude MoH patients, but to stratify accordingly. MoH is widespread 
across  a  variety  of  headache  medications  with  different  modes  of  action.  The  liability  of  orally 
administered CGRP antagonist rimegepant as another type of drug contributing to the development of 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 127/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
MoH  cannot  be  evaluated  on  the  present  clinical  database.  Subjects  with  MoH  were  initially  excluded 
both from study 305 and 201. However, in study 201 this restriction was removed with revised Protocol 
V2.0. In study 305, 22.7% of subjects presented with a history of CM after implementation of Protocol 
Amendment 4, which widened the entry criteria to also include CM. Given the high overlap between CM 
and MoH, there is a degree of uncertainty with regard to MoH among recruited subjects. It is also to be 
taken into account that the dosing interval of 48 hours proposed for migraine prevention is derived from 
acute migraine data of sustained efficacy from 2-48 hours post-dose. Since the liability of rimegepant to 
contribute to the development of MoH is unclear, respective standard warnings are labelled. 
Use in pregnant women  
In  order  to  characterize  the  missing  information  regarding  rimegepant  use  in  pregnant  women,  the 
applicant propose to collect data via two FDA approved studies (402 and 403) conducted in the US to 
obtain information on rimegepant use in pregnant women in an EU-based population.  
Use in patients with  CV  diseases 
The applicant has proposed a PASS to further characterize the risk in “patients with CV diseases.” The 
proposed PASS is an observational cohort study to compare the incidence rate of MACE in new users of 
with migraine and a history of CV disease with similar patients but on other migraine treatments by using 
secondary data from multiple healthcare databases in Europe. The feasibility assessment and the study 
design are adequate to further characterise the risk in “patients with CV diseases.” 
Use in older patients 
The  subgroup  of  subjects  >  65  years  of  age  was  small,  around  2-3%  in  SD  studies  and  5.8%  in 
prevention study 305.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Rimegepant is introduced as the first orally administered CGRP antagonist with claimed benefit for both 
the acute treatment and prophylaxis of migraine. Accordingly, Vydura™ was proposed to be indicated 
for the comprehensive management of migraine in adults, including prophylaxis and acute treatment of 
migraine with or without aura. 
The clinical dossier of includes pivotal efficacy data from two sets of clinical studies that were provided 
for  the  acute  (single  attack  studies  301/302/303)  and  preventive  treatment  (study  305)  of  migraine 
under randomised, placebo-controlled conditions. Supportive data include phase 2b dose ranging study 
CN170003 (with free base RGP capsules, establishing rimgepant 75 mg as the minimum effective dose) 
, and phase 2/3 open-label, long-term safety study 201, during which subjects could receive 75 mg RGP 
doses as needed for up to 52 weeks. 
The overall safety profile of rimegepant appears favourable. On-treatment AEs related to the study drug 
comprise  mainly  unspecific  AEs  like  nausea  (1.3%),  constipation  (1.1%),  diarrhoea  (0.4%),  dizziness 
(1.5%), somnolence (1.1%) and were reported at low frequency. There were no signs for potential abuse 
or hepatotoxicity. No relevant effects on vital signs like HR or BP were observed. 
The  effect  size  of  rimegepant,  however,  was  shown  to  be  modest  both  in  the  acute  and  prophylactic 
clinical trial programme.  
Single  attack  studies  301/302/303  followed  standard  guidance  and  were  almost  identical  in  design. 
Significant superiority over placebo could be shown in terms of the co-primary endpoints, freedom from 
pain  and  most-bothersome  associated  symptoms  at  2  hours  post-dose.  The  magnitude  of  effect, 
however,  was  modest.  The  modest  treatment  effect,  shown  in  single  attack  studies,  contributes  to 
concerns that arise from the lacking proof of consistency of effect across multiple attacks. Although a 
consistency of effect study was planned and discussed within the scope of CHMP-SA (May 2018), no such 
data  were  actually  provided.  Concerns  over  consistency  of  effect  are  further  underlined  by  the  poor 
outcome of long-term study 201. In the largest PRN(2-8) enrolment group (N=1023), representing the 
majority of patients in clinical practice, i.e. subjects with a history of 2-8 attacks experienced per month, 
mean MD were not reduced over the 52-week treatment period, as compared to the 28-day OP. 
Concerns  over  lacking  proof  of  within-patient  consistency  were  addressed  by  exploratory  analysis  of 
efficacy data obtained from PRN use of rimegepant on unscheduled days during the OLE period of study 
305. A focused analysis in subgroups of patients with > 3 moderate to severe MDs and those with > 4 
MDs was provided on the first 3 resp. 4 attacks. The profile obtained largely corresponds to the modest 
treatment effect already observed across the single attack studies 301/302/303. As could be expected, 
the  magnitude  of  requested  within-patient  consistency  parameter  is  considerably  smaller  than  the 
average absolute responder rates observed across the three single attack studies 301/302/303 of 19-
21%. 
The limitations of the requested post hoc data on the efficacy of rimegepant for acute migraine attacks 
experienced  during  the  OLE  period  of  study  305  are  evident:  they  were  generated  post  hoc  under 
uncontrolled, open-label conditions in patients receiving maintenance RGP on scheduled EOD days and 
reflect  only  those  attacks  that  were  experienced  on  days  not  scheduled  for  regular  EOD  preventive 
dosing.  In  the  absence  of  guideline-conforming  data  prospectively  demonstrating  within-patient 
consistency, however, they provide some exploratory insight into within-patient consistency of effect of 
rimegepant in a series of 3-4 consecutive migraine attacks. 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                              Page 132/135 
EMA/CHMP/172260/2022 
 
 
 
Similarly,  there  remain  concerns  about  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  effect  in  prophylactic  migraine 
treatment with rimegepant. During the 12-week DBT of study 305 migraine days were reduced by only 
-0.7 MDs (net effect over placebo, p=0.040), corresponding to far less than 10% of the number of MDs 
experienced during the observation period (rimegepant: 10.3, placebo 9.9 MDs).  
The  clinical  relevance  of  the  -0.7  MDs  net  difference  over  placebo  is  not  supported  by  results  for 
important secondary endpoints, like rescue medication use. In the relevant subgroup of patients with 
concomitant non-study prophylactic medication (rimegepant arm 75/348, 21.6%), rimegepant did not 
separate from placebo. Equally, the modest treatment effect for the primary endpoint goes along with 
non-significant treatment effects in the subgroups of patients with CM history, subjects with less than 8 
attacks per month, and subjects > 65 years of age. It is acknowledged that study 305 was not powered 
to  demonstrate  significant  effects  in  subgroups.  On the other  side, however,  it  is  considered that  the 
findings in subgroups round up the profile of rimegepant as a moderately effective agent. 
In  the  case  of  prevention  study  305,  subjects  with  a  reported  history  of  CM  were  initially  excluded, 
however,  were  admitted  with  Protocol  Amendment  vs.  04  (07-March-2019).  A  stratified  analysis 
according to migraine subtypes was not pre-specified. Robust efficacy in the “CM history” subgroup could 
not be shown. This contrasts with the general label claim of comprehensive management of migraine in 
adults, irrespective of the underlying EM/CM subtype. The available clinical database does not provide 
sufficient evidence for a positive B/R balance in the CM population. Therefore, the wording of indication 
has been revised in section 4.1 of the SmPC to restrict the indication of preventive migraine to those 
with EM in adults who have at least 4 migraine attacks per month. 
With regard to timelines in the course of clinical development, it could be that the concept of also testing 
rimegepant for migraine prophylactic treatment was prompted after receipt of preceding single attack 
study results. The observation that rimegepent achieved sustained pain relief over 48 hours post-dose 
in a subgroup of patients in acute attacks, contributed to the concept of administering rimegepant in 
migraine  prevention  EOD.    In  so  far,  it  is  different  from  migraine  prevention  with  other  orally 
administered agents like ß-blockers, topiramate etc., for which no effect in acute attacks could be shown.  
There are no controlled data to prove efficacy against acute attacks occurring in subjects receiving EOD 
rimegepant  for  migraine  prevention.  Separate  RCTs  were  undertaken  for  efficacy  in  single  attacks 
(301/302/303) and prevention (305, 12-week DBT). The efficacy of rimegepant in acute attacks in EOD 
patients was not shown under placebo-controlled conditions.  
On the other side, it could be shown in the 1-yr OLE period of study 305 that the reduction in MMDs was 
maintained  following  the  EOD+PRN  dosing  scheme.  The  mean  number  of  MDs  per  month  during  the 
initial observation period of study 305 was 9.9 MDs/month (10.1 MDs in previous rimegepant patients 
during  DBT,  9.6  in  placebo  subjects).  The  major  part  of  MD  reduction  was  then  achieved  during  the 
subsequent  12-week  DBT.  Nonetheless,  the  mean  number  of  MDs  per  month  continued  to  decline 
throughout the 52-week OLE period from a mean of 4.6 MDs at Month 1 (N=548) to 2.7 MDs at Month 
13 (N=420).  
A  maximum  daily  dose  of  75  mg  rimegepant  was  specified,  i.e.  in  case  an  acute  attack  occurs, 
rimegepant may only be taken on days not scheduled for regular EOD dosing. It is unclear how restriction 
of rimegepant to be taken for acute treatment on non-scheduled days only, is compatible with clinical 
practice, which requires to treat acute attacks whenever they occur, irrespective of EOD dose schedules.  
The  applicant  argued  that  it  would  be  common  practice  to  have  recourse  to  other  types  of  rescue 
medication once the MDD maximum daily dose of the “standard therapy” is achieved. This is self-evident, 
however, contrasts with the claimed “comprehensive management of migraine” with a single agent, i.e. 
rimegepant. Indeed, the use of rimegepant in case of an acute migraine attack occurring on a scheduled 
EOD dosing day is ruled out.

Further insight was obtained from an analysis how the remaining MDs and rescue medication use spread 
across scheduled and unscheduled days across the 1-year OLE period. The results do not indicate any 
substantive  difference  between  scheduled  and  non-scheduled  days  in  the  mean  number  of  remaining 
MDs per month or in the mean number of rescue medication days per month. Remaining MDs were about 
equally distributed across scheduled and non-scheduled days across the 52-week OLE. The overall open-
label mean number of rescue medication days of 1.3 per month was also equally distributed between 
scheduled days and non-scheduled days. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  overall  safety  profile  of  rimegepant  appears  favourable.  Statistically  significant  superiority  over 
placebo could be shown across primary endpoints, i.e. freedom of pain and MBS at 2-hours post-dose in 
acute treatment and for the reduction of MMDs in migraine prevention. However, the magnitude of effect 
achieved in both treatment settings is considered modest. The clinical relevance of the net treatment 
effect over placebo may still be acknowledged in view of the favourable safety profile of rimegepant. The 
clinical  database  did  not  point  to  CV  or  hepatic  safety  risks  associated  with  the  use  of  rimegepant  in 
acute and preventive migraine treatment.

The  overall  benefit/risk  balance  of  Vydura  is  positive,  subject  to  the  conditions  stated  in  section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus  
that the benefit-risk balance of Vydura is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults 
Preventive  treatment  of  episodic  migraine  in  adults who  have  at  least  4  migraine  attacks  per

The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that rimegepant is to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised 
within the European Union.

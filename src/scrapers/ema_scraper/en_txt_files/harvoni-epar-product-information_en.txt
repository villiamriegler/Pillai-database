Ribavirin dose* 
1,000 mg per day for patients < 75 kg and 1,200 mg for those 
weighing ≥ 75 kg 
Starting dose of 600 mg, which can be titrated up to a maximum 
of 1,000/1,200 mg (1,000 mg for patients weighing < 75 kg and 
1,200 mg for patients weighing ≥ 75 kg) if well tolerated. If the 
starting dose is not well tolerated, the dose should be reduced as 
clinically indicated based on haemoglobin levels 
* 
If a more normalized dose of ribavirin (by weight and renal function) cannot be reached for reasons of tolerability, 
24 weeks of Harvoni + ribavirin should be considered in order to minimize the risk for relapse. 
For adults when ribavirin is added to Harvoni, refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics of 
ribavirin. 
In paediatric patients aged 3 years and above the following ribavirin dosing is recommended where 
ribavirin is divided into two daily doses and given with food:

Dose modification of ribavirin in adults taking 1,000-1,200 mg daily 
If Harvoni is used in combination with ribavirin and a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially 
related to ribavirin, the ribavirin dose should be modified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the 
adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity. Table 5 provides guidelines for dose modifications 
and discontinuation based on the patient’s haemoglobin concentration and cardiac status.

Once ribavirin has been withheld due to either a laboratory abnormality or clinical manifestation, an 
attempt may be made to restart ribavirin at 600 mg daily and further increase the dose to 800 mg daily. 
However, it is not recommended that ribavirin be increased to the originally assigned dose (1,000 mg 
to 1,200 mg daily). 
Paediatric population aged < 3 years 
The safety and efficacy of Harvoni in paediatric patients aged < 3 years have not been established. No 
data are available.

Missed dose 
Patients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 5 hours of dosing an additional tablet 
should be taken. If vomiting occurs more than 5 hours after dosing, no further dose is needed (see 
section 5.1). 
If a dose is missed and it is within 18 hours of the normal time, patients should be instructed to take 
the tablet as soon as possible and then patients should take the next dose at the usual time. If it is after 
18 hours then patients should be instructed to wait and take the next dose at the usual time. Patients 
should be instructed not to take a double dose. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is warranted for elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of Harvoni is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  
Safety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. Harvoni can be 
used in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are available 
(see section 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of Harvoni is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte [CPT] class A, B or C) (see section 5.2). Safety and efficacy of 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir have been established in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (see section 5.1). 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablet(s) whole with or without food. Due to the bitter 
taste, it is recommended that film-coated tablets are not chewed or crushed (see section 5.2). 
4.3 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Co-administration with rosuvastatin (see section 4.5). 
Use with strong P-gp inducers 
Medicinal products that are strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducers in the intestine (carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort). Co-administration will 
significantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and could result in loss of 
efficacy of Harvoni (see section 4.5). 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Harvoni should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing 
sofosbuvir. 
Genotype-specific activity 
Concerning recommended regimens with different HCV genotypes, see section 4.2. Concerning 
genotype-specific virological and clinical activity, see section 5.1. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The clinical data to support the use of Harvoni in adults infected with HCV genotype 3 are limited (see 
section 5.1). The relative efficacy of a 12-week regimen consisting of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
+ ribavirin, compared to a 24-week regimen of sofosbuvir + ribavirin has not been investigated. A 
conservative 24 weeks of therapy is advised in all treatment-experienced genotype 3 patients and those 
treatment-naïve genotype 3 patients with cirrhosis (see section 4.2). In genotype 3-infection, the use of 
Harvoni (always in combination with ribavirin) should only be considered for patients who are 
deemed at high risk for clinical disease progression and who do not have alternative treatment options. 
The clinical data to support the use of Harvoni in adults infected with HCV genotype 2 and 6 are 
limited (see section 5.1). 
Severe bradycardia and heart block 
Life-threatening cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir-
containing regimens are used in combination with amiodarone. Bradycardia has generally occurred 
within hours to days, but cases with a longer time to onset have been observed mostly up to 2 weeks 
after initiating HCV treatment. 
Amiodarone should only be used in patients on Harvoni when other alternative anti-arrhythmic 
treatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. 
Should concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary it is recommended that patients 
undergo cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration, after 
which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the 
first 2 weeks of treatment. 
Due to the long half-life of amiodarone, cardiac monitoring as outlined above should also be carried 
out for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated 
on Harvoni. 
All patients with concurrent or recent use of amiodarone should be warned of the symptoms of 
bradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they 
experience them. 
Use in diabetic patients 
Diabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct-acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic 
patients initiating direct-acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the 
first 3 months, and their diabetic medication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the 
diabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct-acting antiviral therapy is initiated. 
HCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection 
Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after 
treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before 
initiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should 
therefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. 
Treatment of patients with prior exposure to HCV direct-acting antivirals 
In patients who fail treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, selection of NS5A resistance mutations that 
substantially reduce the susceptibility to ledipasvir is seen in the majority of cases (see section 5.1). 
Limited data indicate that such NS5A mutations do not revert on long-term follow-up. There are 
presently no data to support the effectiveness of retreatment of patients who have failed 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with a subsequent regimen that contains an NS5A inhibitor. Similarly, there are 
presently no data to support the effectiveness of NS3/4A protease inhibitors in patients who previously 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
failed prior therapy that included an NS3/4A protease inhibitor. Such patients may therefore be 
dependent on other classes of medicinal products for clearance of HCV infection. Consequently, 
consideration should be given to longer treatment for patients with uncertain subsequent retreatment 
options. 
Renal impairment 
Safety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and ESRD requiring haemodialysis. Harvoni can be used in these 
patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are available (see 
sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). When Harvoni is used in combination with ribavirin refer also to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) 
< 50 mL/min (see section 5.2). 
Adults with decompensated cirrhosis and/or who are awaiting liver transplant or post-liver transplant 
The efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in genotype 5 and genotype 6 HCV-infected patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis and/or who are awaiting liver transplant or post-liver transplant has not been 
investigated. Treatment with Harvoni should be guided by an assessment of the potential benefits and 
risks for the individual patient. 
Use with moderate P-gp inducers 
Medicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g. oxcarbazepine) may decrease 
ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Harvoni. 
Co-administration of such medicinal products is not recommended with Harvoni (see section 4.5). 
Use with certain HIV antiretroviral regimens 
Harvoni has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure, especially when used together with an HIV 
regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or 
cobicistat). The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the setting of Harvoni and a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established. The potential risks and benefits associated with 
co-administration of Harvoni with the fixed-dose combination tablet containing 
elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
given in conjunction with a boosted HIV protease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be 
considered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving Harvoni 
concomitantly with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or with 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for tenofovir-
associated adverse reactions. Refer to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate, or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Summary of Product 
Characteristics for recommendations on renal monitoring. 
Use with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 
Co-administration of Harvoni and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can significantly increase 
the concentration of the statin, which increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (see 
section 4.5). 
Paediatric population 
Harvoni is not recommended for use in paediatric patients aged < 3 years because the safety and 
efficacy have not been established in this population.

Excipients 
Harvoni contains the azo colouring agent sunset yellow FCF (E110), which may cause allergic 
reactions. It also contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
As Harvoni contains ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, any interactions that have been identified with these 
active substances individually may occur with Harvoni. 
Potential for Harvoni to affect other medicinal products 
Ledipasvir is an in vitro inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) 
and may increase intestinal absorption of co-administered substrates for these transporters.  
Potential for other medicinal products to affect Harvoni 
Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir are substrates of drug transporter P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. 
Medicinal products that are strong P-gp inducers (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort) may significantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma 
concentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and thus are 
contraindicated with Harvoni (see section 4.3). Medicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers in 
the intestine (e.g. oxcarbazepine) may decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations 
leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Harvoni. Co-administration with such medicinal products is 
not recommended with Harvoni (see section 4.4). Co-administration with medicinal products that 
inhibit P-gp and/or BCRP may increase ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations without 
increasing GS-331007 plasma concentration; Harvoni may be co-administered with P-gp and/or 
BCRP inhibitors. Clinically significant medicinal product interactions with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
mediated by CYP450s or UGT1A1 enzymes are not expected. 
Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists 
As liver function may change during treatment with Harvoni, a close monitoring of International 
Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. 
Impact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver 
The pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. immunosuppressive agents such 
as calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in liver function during DAA therapy, related to 
clearance of HCV virus. 
Interactions between Harvoni and other medicinal products 
Table 6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product 
interactions (where 90% confidence interval [CI] of the geometric least-squares mean [GLSM] ratio 
were within “↔”, extended above “↑”, or extended below “↓” the predetermined equivalence 
boundaries). The medicinal product interactions described are based on studies conducted with either 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as individual agents, or are predicted medicinal 
product interactions that may occur with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. The table is not all-inclusive.

Recommendation concerning co-administration 
with Harvoni 
Ledipasvir solubility decreases as pH increases. 
Medicinal products that increase gastric pH are 
expected to decrease concentration of ledipasvir. 
It is recommended to separate antacid and Harvoni 
administration by 4 hours. 
H2-receptor antagonists may be administered 
simultaneously with or staggered from Harvoni at a 
dose that does not exceed doses comparable to 
famotidine 40 mg twice daily. 
Proton pump inhibitor doses comparable to 
omeprazole 20 mg can be administered 
simultaneously with Harvoni. Proton pump 
inhibitors should not be taken before Harvoni.

Recommendation concerning co-administration 
with Harvoni 
Coadministration of amiodarone with a sofosbuvir-
containing regimen may result in serious 
symptomatic bradycardia.  
Use only if no other alternative is available. Close 
monitoring is recommended if this medicinal 
product is administered with Harvoni (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Co-administration of Harvoni with digoxin may 
increase the concentration of digoxin. Caution is 
warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring 
of digoxin is recommended when co-administered 
with Harvoni. 
Clinical monitoring, looking for signs of bleeding 
and anaemia, is recommended when dabigatran 
etexilate is co-administered with Harvoni. A 
coagulation test helps to identify patients with an 
increased bleeding risk due to increased dabigatran 
exposure. 
Close monitoring of INR is recommended with all 
vitamin K antagonists. This is due to liver function 
changes during treatment with Harvoni. 
Harvoni is contraindicated with phenobarbital and 
phenytoin (see section 4.3). 
Harvoni is contraindicated with carbamazepine (see 
section 4.3).

Recommendation concerning co-administration 
with Harvoni 
Co-administration of Harvoni with oxcarbazepine is 
expected to decrease the concentration of ledipasvir 
and sofosbuvir leading to reduced therapeutic effect

Recommendation concerning co-administration 
with Harvoni 
Co-administration of Harvoni with rifapentine is 
expected to decrease the concentration of ledipasvir 
and sofosbuvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect 
of Harvoni. Such co-administration is not 
recommended. 
No dose adjustment of Harvoni or midazolam is 
required.

Recommendation concerning co-administration 
with Harvoni 
When given with elvitegravir/ cobicistat/ 
emtricitabine/ tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 
Harvoni is expected to increase the concentration of 
tenofovir. 
The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the 
setting of Harvoni and a pharmacokinetic enhancer 
(e.g. ritonavir or cobicistat) has not been 
established. 
The combination should be used with caution with 
frequent renal monitoring, if other alternatives are 
not available (see section 4.4). 
No dose adjustment required. 
Harvoni is contraindicated with St. John’s wort (see 
section 4.3). 
Co-administration of Harvoni with rosuvastatin may 
significantly increase the concentration of 
rosuvastatin (several fold-increase in AUC) which 
is associated with increased risk of myopathy, 
including rhabdomyolysis. Co-administration of 
Harvoni with rosuvastatin is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Co-administration of Harvoni with pravastatin may 
significantly increase the concentration of 
pravastatin which is associated with increased risk 
of myopathy. Clinical and biochemical control is 
recommended in these patients and a dose 
adjustment may be needed (see section 4.4). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recommendation concerning co-administration 
with Harvoni 
Interactions cannot be excluded with other 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. When 
co-administered with Harvoni, a reduced dose of 
statins should be considered and careful monitoring 
for statin adverse reactions should be undertaken 
(see section 4.4). 
No dose adjustment of Harvoni or methadone is 
required. 
No dose adjustment of Harvoni or ciclosporin is 
required at initiation of co-administration. 
Afterwards, close monitoring and potential dose 
adjustment of ciclosporin may be required. 
No dose adjustment of Harvoni or tacrolimus is 
required at initiation of co-administration. 
Afterwards, close monitoring and potential dose 
adjustment of tacrolimus may be required.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / contraception in males and females 
When Harvoni is used in combination with ribavirin, extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy 
in female patients and in female partners of male patients. Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal 
effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. Women of childbearing 
potential or their male partners must use an effective form of contraception during treatment and for a 
period of time after the treatment has concluded as recommended in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for ribavirin. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for 
additional information. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ledipasvir, 
sofosbuvir or Harvoni in pregnant women. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Animal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. No 
significant effects on foetal development have been observed with ledipasvir or sofosbuvir in rats and 
rabbits. However, it has not been possible to fully estimate exposure margins achieved for sofosbuvir 
in the rat relative to the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Harvoni during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether ledipasvir or sofosbuvir and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals has shown excretion of ledipasvir and metabolites of 
sofosbuvir in milk (see section 5.3). 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Therefore, Harvoni should not be used during 
breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of Harvoni on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate 
harmful effects of ledipasvir or sofosbuvir on fertility. 
If ribavirin is co-administered with Harvoni, the contraindications regarding use of ribavirin during 
pregnancy and breast-feeding apply (see also the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Harvoni (administered alone or in combination with ribavirin) has no or negligible influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines. However, patients should be advised that fatigue was more common 
in patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir compared to placebo. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile in adults 
The safety assessment of Harvoni was mainly based on pooled Phase 3 clinical studies, without a 
control, in 1952 patients who received Harvoni for 8, 12 or 24 weeks, including 872 patients who 
received Harvoni in combination with ribavirin. 
The proportion of patients who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0%, 
< 1% and 1% for patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 8, 12 and 24 weeks, respectively; and 
< 1%, 0%, and 2% for patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin combination therapy for 8, 
12 and 24 weeks, respectively. 
In clinical studies, fatigue and headache were more common in patients treated with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir compared to placebo. When ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was studied with ribavirin, the 
most frequent adverse drug reactions to ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin combination therapy were 
consistent with the known safety profile of ribavirin, without increasing the frequency or severity of 
the expected adverse drug reactions. 
Tabulated list of adverse events 
The following adverse drug reactions have been identified with Harvoni (Table 7). The adverse 
reactions are listed below by body system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as 
follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) or very rare (< 1/10,000).

Adults with decompensated cirrhosis and/or who are awaiting liver transplant or post-liver transplant 
The safety profile of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks in adults with 
decompensated liver disease and/or those post-liver transplant was assessed in two open-label studies 
(SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2). No new adverse drug reactions were detected among patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis and/or who were post-liver transplant and who received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
with ribavirin. Although adverse events, including serious adverse events, occurred more frequently in 
this study compared to studies that excluded decompensated patients and/or patients who were post-
liver transplantation, the adverse events observed were those expected as clinical sequelae of advanced 
liver disease and/or transplantation or were consistent with the known safety profile of ribavirin (see 
section 5.1 for details of this study). 
Decreases in haemoglobin to < 10 g/dL and < 8.5 g/dL during treatment were experienced by 39% and 
13% of patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin, respectively. Ribavirin was 
discontinued in 15% of the patients. 
7% of liver transplant recipients had a modification of their immunosuppressive agents. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was administered for 12 weeks to 18 patients with genotype 1 CHC and severe 
renal impairment in an open-label study (Study 0154). In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate 
of adverse events was not clearly elevated from what is expected in patients with severe renal 
impairment. 
The safety of Harvoni has been evaluated in a 12-week non-controlled study including 95 patients 
with ESRD requiring dialysis (Study 4063). In this setting, exposure of sofosbuvir metabolite GS-
331007 is 20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse reactions have been observed in 
preclinical trials. In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events and deaths was not 
clearly elevated from what is expected in ESRD patients. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Harvoni in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above are based on data 
from a Phase 2, open-label clinical study (Study 1116) that enrolled 226 patients who were treated 
with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 or 24 weeks or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24 weeks. The 
adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in adults (see Table 7). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Cardiac arrhythmias 
Cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when Harvoni is used with 
amiodarone and/or other drugs that lower heart rate (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Skin disorders 
Frequency not known: Stevens-Johnson syndrome

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest documented doses of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir were 120 mg twice daily for 10 days and a 
single dose of 1,200 mg, respectively. In these healthy volunteer studies, there were no untoward 
effects observed at these dose levels, and adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity to 
those reported in the placebo groups. The effects of higher doses are not known. 
No specific antidote is available for overdose with Harvoni. If overdose occurs the patient must be 
monitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with Harvoni consists of general supportive 
measures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. 
Haemodialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of ledipasvir as ledipasvir is highly bound to 
plasma protein. Haemodialysis can efficiently remove the predominant circulating metabolite of 
sofosbuvir, GS-331007, with an extraction ratio of 53%. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Direct-acting antiviral, ATC code: J05AP51 
Mechanism of action 
Ledipasvir is a HCV inhibitor targeting the HCV NS5A protein, which is essential for both RNA 
replication and the assembly of HCV virions. Biochemical confirmation of NS5A inhibition by 
ledipasvir is not currently possible as NS5A has no enzymatic function. In vitro resistance selection 
and cross-resistance studies indicate ledipasvir targets NS5A as its mode of action. 
Sofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is 
essential for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular 
metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analogue triphosphate (GS-461203), which 
can be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. 
GS-461203 (the active metabolite of sofosbuvir) is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and 
RNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. 
Antiviral activity 
The EC50 values of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir against full-length or chimeric replicons encoding NS5A 
and NS5B sequences from clinical isolates are detailed in Table 8. The presence of 40% human serum 
had no effect on the anti-HCV activity of sofosbuvir but reduced the anti-HCV activity of ledipasvir 
by 12-fold against genotype 1a HCV replicons.

Resistance 
In cell culture 
HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir have been selected in cell culture for 
genotype 1a and 1b. Reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir was associated with the primary NS5A 
substitution Y93H in both genotype 1a and 1b. Additionally a Q30E substitution developed in 
genotype 1a replicons. Site-directed mutagenesis of NS5A RAVs showed that substitutions conferring 
a fold-change > 100 and ≤ 1,000 in ledipasvir susceptibility are Q30H/R, L31I/M/V, P32L and Y93T 
in genotype 1a and P58D and Y93S in genotype 1b; and substitutions conferring a fold-change 
> 1,000 are M28A/G, Q30E/G/K, H58D, Y93C/H/N/S in genotype 1a and A92K and Y93H in 
genotype 1b. 
HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell culture for multiple 
genotypes including 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a. Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated 
with the primary NS5B substitution S282T in all replicon genotypes examined. Site-directed 
mutagenesis of the S282T substitution in replicons of 8 genotypes conferred 2- to 18-fold reduced 
susceptibility to sofosbuvir and reduced the viral replication capacity by 89% to 99% compared to the 
corresponding wild-type. 
In clinical studies – Adults-Genotype 1 
In a pooled analysis of patients who received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in Phase 3 studies (ION-3, ION-1 
and ION-2), 37 patients (29 with genotype 1a and 8 with genotype 1b) qualified for resistance analysis 
due to virologic failure or early study drug discontinuation and having HCV RNA > 1,000 IU/mL. 
Post-baseline NS5A and NS5B deep sequencing data (assay cut off of 1%) were available for 37/37 
and 36/37 patients, respectively. 
NS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs) were observed in post-baseline isolates from 
29/37 patients (22/29 genotype 1a and 7/8 genotype 1b) not achieving sustained virologic response 
(SVR). Of the 29 genotype 1a patients who qualified for resistance testing, 22/29 (76%) patients 
harboured one or more NS5A RAVs at positions K24, M28, Q30, L31, S38 and Y93 at failure, while 
the remaining 7/29 patients had no NS5A RAVs detected at failure. The most common variants were 
Q30R, Y93H and L31M. Of the 8 genotype 1b patients who qualified for resistance testing, 7/8 (88%) 
harboured one or more NS5A RAVs at positions L31 and Y93 at failure, while 1/8 patients had no 
NS5A RAVs at failure. The most common variant was Y93H. Among the 8 patients who had no 
NS5A RAVs at failure, 7 patients received 8 weeks of treatment (n = 3 with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir; 
n = 4 with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin) and 1 patient received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. 
In phenotypic analyses, post-baseline isolates from patients who harboured NS5A RAVs at failure 
showed 20- to at least a 243-fold (the highest dose tested) reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir. 
Site-directed mutagenesis of the Y93H substitution in both genotype 1a and 1b as well as the Q30R 
and L31M substitution in genotype 1a conferred high levels of reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir 
(fold-change in EC50 ranging from 544-fold to 1,677-fold). 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
Among post-transplant patients with compensated liver disease or patients with decompensated liver 
disease either pre- or post-transplant (SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies), relapse was associated with 
the detection of one or more of the following NS5A RAVs: K24R, M28T, Q30R/H/K, L31V, H58D 
and Y93H/C in 12/14 genotype 1a patients, and L31M, Y93H/N in 6/6 genotype 1b patients. 
A NS5B substitution E237G was detected in 3 patients (1 genotype 1b and 2 genotype 1a) in the 
Phase 3 studies (ION-3, ION-1 and ION-2) and 3 patients with genotype 1a infection in the SOLAR-1 
and SOLAR-2 studies at the time of relapse. The E237G substitution showed a 1.3-fold reduction in 
susceptibility to sofosbuvir in the genotype 1a replicon assay. The clinical significance of this 
substitution is currently unknown. 
The sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T in NS5B was not detected in any virologic 
failure isolate from the Phase 3 studies. However, the NS5B S282T substitution in combination with 
NS5A substitutions L31M, Y93H and Q30L were detected in one patient at failure following 8 weeks 
of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir from a Phase 2 study (LONESTAR). This patient was 
subsequently retreated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 24 weeks and achieved SVR 
following retreatment. 
In the SIRIUS study (see “Clinical efficacy and safety”, below) 5 patients with genotype 1 infection 
relapsed after treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin. NS5A RAVs were seen at 
relapse in 5/5 patients (for genotype 1a: Q30R/H + L31M/V [n = 1] and Q30R [n = 1]; for 
genotype 1b: Y93H [n = 3]). 
In clinical studies – Adults-Genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 
NS5A RAVs: No genotype 2 infected patients experienced relapse in the clinical study and therefore 
there are no data regarding NS5A RAVs at the time of failure. 
In genotype 3 infected patients experiencing virologic failure, development of NS5A RAVs (including 
enrichment of RAVs present at baseline) was typically not detected at the time of failure (n = 17). 
In genotype 4, 5 and 6 infection, only small numbers of patients have been evaluated (total of 
5 patients with failure). The NS5A substitution Y93C emerged in the HCV of 1 patient (genotype 4), 
while NS5A RAVs present at baseline were observed at the time of failure in all patients. In the 
SOLAR-2 study, one patient with genotype 4d developed NS5B substitution E237G at the time of 
relapse. The clinical significance of this substitution is currently unknown. 
NS5B RAVs: The NS5B substitution S282T emerged in the HCV of 1/17 genotype 3-failures, and in 
the HCV of 1/3, 1/1 and 1/1 of genotype 4-, 5- and 6-failures, respectively. 
Effect of baseline HCV resistance-associated variants on treatment outcome 
Adults-Genotype 1 
Analyses were conducted to explore the association between pre-existing baseline NS5A RAVs and 
treatment outcome. In the pooled analysis of the Phase 3 studies, 16% of patients had baseline 
NS5A RAVs identified by population or deep sequencing irrespective of subtype. Baseline 
NS5A RAVs were overrepresented in patients who experienced relapse in the Phase 3 studies (see 
“Clinical efficacy and safety”). 
Following 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (without ribavirin) in treatment-
experienced patients (arm 1 of ION-2 study) 4/4 patients with baseline NS5A RAVs conferring a 
ledipasvir fold-change of ≤ 100 achieved SVR. For the same treatment arm, patients with baseline 
NS5A RAVs conferring a fold-change of > 100, relapse occurred in 4/13 (31%), as compared to 3/95 
(3%) in those without any baseline RAVs or RAVs conferring a fold-change of ≤ 100. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin in treatment-experienced 
patients with compensated cirrhosis (SIRIUS, n = 77), 8/8 patients with baseline NS5A RAVs 
conferring > 100-fold reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir achieved SVR12. 
Among post-transplant patients with compensated liver disease (SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies), no 
relapse occurred in patients with baseline NS5A RAVs (n = 23) following 12 weeks of treatment with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin. Among patients with decompensated liver disease (pre- and post-
transplant), 4/16 (25%) patients with NS5A RAVs conferring > 100-fold resistance relapsed after 
12 weeks treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin compared to 7/120 (6%) in those without 
any baseline NS5A RAVs or RAVs conferring a fold-change of ≤ 100. 
The group of NS5A RAVs that conferred > 100-fold shift and was observed in patients were the 
following substitutions in genotype 1a (M28A, Q30H/R/E, L31M/V/I, H58D, Y93H/N/C) or in 
genotype 1b (Y93H). The proportion of such baseline NS5A RAVs seen with deep sequencing varied 
from very low (cut off for assay = 1%) to high (main part of the plasma population). 
The sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T was not detected in the baseline NS5B 
sequence of any patient in Phase 3 studies by population or deep sequencing. SVR was achieved in all 
24 patients (n = 20 with L159F+C316N; n = 1 with L159F; and n = 3 with N142T) who had baseline 
variants associated with resistance to NS5B nucleoside inhibitors. 
Adults-Genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 
Due to the limited size of studies, the impact of baseline NS5A RAVs on treatment outcome for 
patients with genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 CHC has not been fully evaluated. No major differences in 
outcomes were observed by the presence or absence of baseline NS5A RAVs. 
Paediatric Patients 
The presence of pre-treatment NS5A and/or NS5B RAVs did not impact treatment outcome as all 
subjects with pre-treatment RAVs achieved SVR12 and SVR24. One 8-year-old subject infected with 
genotype 1a HCV who failed to achieve SVR12 had no NS5A or NS5B nucleoside inhibitor RAVs at 
baseline and had emergent NS5A RAV Y93H at relapse. 
Cross-resistance 
Ledipasvir was fully active against the sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T in NS5B 
while all ledipasvir resistance-associated substitutions in NS5A were fully susceptible to sofosbuvir. 
Both sofosbuvir and ledipasvir were fully active against substitutions associated with resistance to 
other classes of direct-acting antivirals with different mechanisms of actions, such as NS5B 
non-nucleoside inhibitors and NS3 protease inhibitors. NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to 
ledipasvir may reduce the antiviral activity of other NS5A inhibitors. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of ledipasvir [LDV]/sofosbuvir [SOF] was evaluated in three open-label Phase 3 studies 
with data available for a total of 1,950 patients with genotype 1 CHC. The three Phase 3 studies 
included one study conducted in non-cirrhotic treatment-naïve patients (ION-3); one study in cirrhotic 
and non-cirrhotic treatment-naïve patients (ION-1); and one study in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic 
patients who failed prior therapy with an interferon-based regimen, including regimens containing an 
HCV protease inhibitor (ION-2). Patients in these studies had compensated liver disease. All three 
Phase 3 studies evaluated the efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin. 
Treatment duration was fixed in each study. Serum HCV RNA values were measured during the 
clinical studies using the COBAS TaqMan HCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System. 
The assay had a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU/mL. SVR was the primary endpoint to 
determine the HCV cure rate which was defined as HCV RNA less than LLOQ at 12 weeks after the 
cessation of treatment.

ION-3 evaluated 8 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin and 
12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic patients with 
genotype 1 CHC. Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups and 
stratified by HCV genotype (1a versus 1b).

The 8-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin was non-inferior to the 8-week 
treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin (treatment difference 0.9%; 95% confidence interval: 
-3.9% to 5.7%) and the 12-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (treatment difference -2.3%; 97.5% 
confidence interval: -7.2% to 3.6%). Among patients with a baseline HCV RNA < 6 million IU/mL, 
the SVR was 97% (119/123) with 8-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and 96% (126/131) with 
12-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.

Table 16 presents relapse rates with the 12-week regimens (with or without ribavirin) for selected 
subgroups (see also previous section “Effect of baseline HCV resistance-associated variants on 
treatment outcome”). In non-cirrhotic patients relapses only occurred in the presence of baseline 
NS5A RAVs, and during therapy with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin. In cirrhotic patients 
relapses occurred with both regimens, and in the absence and presence of baseline NS5A RAVs.

The study (double-blind and placebo-controlled) evaluated 24 weeks of treatment 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (with ribavirin placebo) versus 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
with ribavirin. Patients in the latter treatment arm received placebo (for ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and 
ribavirin) during the first 12 weeks, followed by active blinded therapy during the subsequent 
12 weeks. Patients were stratified by HCV genotype (1a versus 1b) and prior treatment response 
(whether HCV RNA < LLOQ had been achieved). 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across the two treatment groups. The 
median age was 56 years (range: 23 to 77); 74% of patients were male; 97% were white; 63% had 
genotype 1a HCV infection; 94% had non-CC IL28B alleles (CT or TT). 
Of the 155 patients enrolled, 1 patient discontinued treatment whilst on placebo. Of the remaining 
154 patients, a total of 149 achieved SVR12 across both treatment groups; 96% (74/77) of patients in 
the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin 12-week group and 97% (75/77) of patients in the 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 24-week group. All 5 patients who did not achieve SVR12 relapsed after having 
end-of-treatment response (see section “Resistance” – “In clinical studies” above). 
Previously treated adults who have failed on sofosbuvir + ribavirin ± PEG-IFN 
The efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in patients who had previously failed treatment with sofosbuvir + 
ribavirin ± PEG-IFN is supported by two clinical studies. In study 1118, 44 patients with genotype 1 
infection, including 12 cirrhotic patients, who had previously failed treatment with sofosbuvir + 
ribavirin + PEG-IFN or with sofosbuvir + ribavirin were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin 
for 12 weeks; the SVR was 100% (44/44). In study ION-4, 13 HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients with 
genotype 1, including 1 cirrhotic patient, who had failed a sofosbuvir + ribavirin regimen were 
enrolled; the SVR was 100% (13/13) after 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. 
HCV/HIV co-infected adults – ION-4 
ION-4 was an open-label clinical study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment 
with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin in HCV treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced 
patients with genotype 1 or 4 CHC who were co-infected with HIV-1. Treatment-experienced patients 
had failed prior treatment with PEG-IFN + ribavirin ± an HCV protease inhibitor or sofosbuvir + 
ribavirin ± PEG-IFN. Patients were on a stable HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy that included 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, administered with efavirenz, rilpivirine or raltegravir. 
The median age was 52 years (range: 26 to 72); 82% of the patients were male; 61% were white; 34% 
were black; 75% had genotype 1a HCV infection; 2% had genotype 4 infection; 76% had non-CC 
IL28B alleles (CT or TT); and 20% had compensated cirrhosis. Fifty-five percent (55%) of the 
patients were treatment-experienced.

HCV/HIV co-infected adults – ERADICATE 
ERADICATE was an open-label study to evaluate 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in 
50 patients with genotype 1 CHC co-infected with HIV. All patients were treatment-naïve to HCV 
therapy without cirrhosis, 26% (13/50) of patients were HIV antiretroviral naïve and 74% (37/50) of 
patients were receiving concomitant HIV antiretroviral therapy. At the time of the interim analysis 
40 patients have reached 12 weeks post treatment and SVR12 was 98% (39/40). 
Patients awaiting liver transplantation and post-liver transplant – SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 
SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 were two open-label clinical studies that evaluated 12 and 24 weeks of 
treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin in genotype 1 and 4 HCV-infected 
patients who have undergone liver transplantation and/or who have decompensated liver disease. The 
two studies were identical in study design. Patients were enrolled in one of the seven groups based on 
liver transplantation status and severity of hepatic impairment (see Table 18). Patients with a CPT 
score > 12 were excluded. Within each group, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across the treatment groups. Of the 670 
treated patients, the median age was 59 years (range: 21 to 81 years); 77% of the patients were male; 
91% were White; mean body mass index was 28 kg/m2 (range: 18 to 49 kg/m2); 94% and 6% had 
genotype 1 and 4 HCV infection, respectively; 78% of the patients failed a prior HCV therapy. Among 
the patients who had decompensated cirrhosis (pre- or post-transplant), 64% and 36% were CPT 
class B and C at screening, respectively, 24% had a baseline Model for End Stage Liver Disease 
(MELD) score greater than 15.

Forty patients with genotype 4 CHC were enrolled in SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies, SVR12 were 
92% (11/12) and 100% (10/10) in post-transplant patients without decompensated cirrhosis and 60% 
(6/10) and 75% (6/8) in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (pre- and post-liver transplantation) 
treated for 12 or 24 weeks, respectively. Of the 7 patients who failed to achieve SVR12, 3 relapsed, all 
had decompensated cirrhosis and were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks. 
Changes in MELD and CPT score from baseline to post-treatment Week 12 were analyzed for all 
patients with decompensated cirrhosis (pre- or post-transplant) who achieved SVR12 and for whom 
data were available (n = 123) to assess the effect of SVR12 on hepatic function. 
Change in MELD score: Among those who achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks treatment with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin, 57% (70/123) and 19% (23/123) had an improvement or no change 
in MELD score from baseline to post-treatment week 12, respectively; of the 32 patients whose 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MELD score was ≥ 15 at baseline, 59% (19/32) had a MELD score < 15 at post-treatment Week 12. 
The improvement in MELD scores observed was driven largely by improvements in total bilirubin. 
Change in CPT score and class: Among those who achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks treatment with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin, 60% (74/123) and 34% (42/123) had an improvement or no 
change of CPT scores from baseline to post-treatment week 12, respectively; of the 32 patients who 
had CPT C cirrhosis at baseline, 53% (17/32) had CPT B cirrhosis at post-treatment Week 12; of the 
88 patients who had CPT B cirrhosis at baseline, 25% (22/88) had CPT A cirrhosis at post-treatment 
Week 12. The improvement in CPT scores observed was driven largely by improvements in total 
bilirubin and albumin. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (see also section 4.4) 
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir has been evaluated for the treatment of non-genotype 1 infection in small 
Phase 2 studies, as summarised below. 
The clinical studies enrolled patients with or without cirrhosis, who were treatment-naïve or with prior 
treatment failure after therapy with PEG-IFN + ribavirin +/- an HCV protease inhibitor. 
For genotype 2, 4, 5 and 6 infection, therapy consisted of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin, 
given for 12 weeks (Table 19). For genotype 3 infection, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was given with or 
without ribavirin, also for 12 weeks (Table 20).

Patients with renal impairment 
Study 0154 was an open-label clinical study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of 
treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in 18 genotype 1 HCV-infected patients with severe renal 
impairment not requiring dialysis. At baseline, two patients had cirrhosis and the mean eGFR was 
24.9 mL/min (range: 9.0-39.6). SVR12 was achieved in 18/18 patients. 
Study 4063 was an open-label three-arm clinical study that evaluated 8, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment 
with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in a total of 95 patients with genotype 1 (72%), 2 (22%), 4 (2%), 5 (1%), or 
6 (2%) CHC and ESRD requiring dialysis: 45 treatment-naïve genotype 1 HCV-infected patients 
without cirrhosis received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 8 weeks; 31 treatment-experienced genotype 1

HCV-infected patients and treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced patients with genotype 2, 5, and 
6 infection without cirrhosis received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks; and 19 genotype 1, 2, and 4 
HCV-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 24 weeks. Of the 
95 total patients, at baseline, 20% of patients had cirrhosis, 22% were treatment experienced, 21% had 
received a kidney transplant, 92% were on hemodialysis, and 8% were on peritoneal dialysis; mean 
duration on dialysis was 11.5 years (range: 0.2 to 43.0 years). The SVR rates for the 8, 12, and 24 
week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment groups were 93% (42/45), 100% (31/31), and 79% (15/19), 
respectively. Of the seven patients who did not achieve SVR12, none experienced virologic failure or 
relapsed. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in HCV infected patients aged 3 years and above was evaluated 
in a Phase 2, open label clinical study that enrolled 226 patients: 221 patients with genotype 1, 2 
patients with genotype 3, and 3 patients with genotype 4 CHC (Study 1116) (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
Patients aged 12 to < 18 Years: 
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was evaluated in 100 patients aged 12 to < 18 years with genotype 1 HCV 
infection. A total of 80 patients (n=80) were treatment-naïve, while 20 patients (n=20) were 
treatment-experienced. All patients were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment-naïve and 
treatment-experienced patients. The median age was 15 years (range: 12 to 17); 63% of the patients 
were female; 91% were White, 7% were Black, and 2% were Asian; 13% were Hispanic/Latino; mean 
weight was 61.3 kg (range: 33.0 to 126.0 kg); 55% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or 
equal to 800,000 IU/mL; 81% had genotype 1a HCV infection; and 1 patient who was treatment naïve 
was known to have cirrhosis. The majority of patients (84%) had been infected through vertical 
transmission. 
The SVR12 rate was 98% overall (98% [78/80] in treatment-naïve patients and 100% [20/20] in 
treatment experienced patients). A total of 2 out of 100 patients (2%), both treatment- naïve, did not 
achieve SVR12 (due to loss to follow-up). No patient experienced virologic failure. 
Patients aged 6 to < 12 Years:  
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was evaluated in 92 patients aged 6 to < 12 years with genotype 1, 3, or 4 
HCV-infection. A total of 72 patients (78%) were treatment-naïve and 20 patients (22%) were 
treatment-experienced. Eighty-nine of the patients (87 patients with genotype 1 HCV infection and 2 
patients with genotype 4 HCV infection) were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, 1 
treatment experienced patient with genotype 1 HCV infection and cirrhosis was treated with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, and 2 treatment experienced patients with genotype 3 HCV 
infection were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24 weeks.  
The median age was 9 years (range: 6 to 11); 59% of the patients were male; 79% were White, 8% 
were Black, and 5% were Asian; 10% were Hispanic/Latino; mean weight was 32.8 kg (range: 17.5 to 
76.4 kg); 59% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000  IU/ mL; 84% had 
genotype 1a HCV infection; 2 patients (1 treatment-naïve, 1 treatment-experienced) had known 
cirrhosis. The majority of patients (97%) had been infected through vertical transmission.  
The SVR rate was 99% overall (99% [88/89], 100% [1/1], and 100% [2/2] in patients treated with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus 
ribavirin for 24 weeks, respectively). The one treatment-naïve patient with genotype 1 HCV infection 
and cirrhosis who was treated with Harvoni for 12 weeks did not achieve SVR12 and relapsed.  
Patients aged 3 to < 6 Years:  
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was evaluated in 34 patients aged 3 to < 6 years with genotype 1 (n = 33) or 
genotype 4 (n = 1) HCV-infection. All of the patients were treatment-naïve and treated with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. The median age was 5 years (range: 3 to 5); 71% of the patients 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were female; 79% were White, 3% were Black, and 6% were Asian; 18% were Hispanic/Latino; mean 
weight was 19.2 kg (range: 10.7 to 33.6 kg); 56% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal 
to 800,000 IU/ mL; 82% had genotype 1a HCV infection; no patients had known cirrhosis. All patients 
(100%) had been infected through vertical transmission.  
The SVR rate was 97% overall (97% [32/33] in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection and 100% 
[1/1] in patients with genotype 4 HCV infection). One patient who prematurely discontinued study 
treatment after five days due to abnormal taste of the medication did not achieve SVR. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir to HCV-infected patients, ledipasvir median 
peak plasma concentration was observed at 4.0 hours post-dose. Sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and 
the median peak plasma concentrations were observed ~ 1 hour post-dose. Median peak plasma 
concentration of GS-331007 was observed at 4 hours post-dose. 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients, geometric mean 
steady-state AUC0-24 for ledipasvir (n = 2,113), sofosbuvir (n = 1,542), and GS-331007 (n = 2,113) 
were 7,290, 1,320 and 12,000 ng•h/mL, respectively. Steady-state Cmax for ledipasvir, sofosbuvir and 
GS-331007 were 323, 618 and 707 ng/mL, respectively. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0-24 and Cmax 
were similar in healthy adult subjects and patients with HCV infection. Relative to healthy subjects 
(n = 191), ledipasvir AUC0-24 and Cmax were 24% lower and 32% lower, respectively, in HCV-infected 
patients. Ledipasvir AUC is dose proportional over the dose range of 3 to 100 mg. Sofosbuvir and 
GS-331007 AUCs are near dose proportional over the dose range of 200 mg to 400 mg. 
Effects of food 
Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with a 
moderate fat or high fat meal increased the sofosbuvir AUC0-inf by approximately 2-fold, but did not 
significantly affect the sofosbuvir Cmax. The exposures to GS-331007 and ledipasvir were not altered in 
the presence of either meal type. Harvoni can be administered without regard to food. 
Distribution 
Ledipasvir is > 99.8% bound to human plasma proteins. After a single 90 mg dose of [14C]-ledipasvir 
in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity ranged between 0.51 and 0.66. 
Sofosbuvir is approximately 61-65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent 
of drug concentration over the range of 1 µg/mL to 20 µg/mL. Protein binding of GS-331007 was 
minimal in human plasma. After a single 400 mg dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir in healthy subjects, the 
blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity was approximately 0.7. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro, no detectable metabolism of ledipasvir was observed by human CYP1A2, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Evidence of slow oxidative metabolism via an unknown 
mechanism has been observed. Following a single dose of 90 mg [14C]-ledipasvir, systemic exposure 
was almost exclusively due to the parent drug (> 98%). Unchanged ledipasvir is also the major species 
present in faeces. 
Sofosbuvir is extensively metabolised in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside 
analogue triphosphate GS-461203. The active metabolite is not observed. The metabolic activation 
pathway involves sequential hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester moiety catalysed by human cathepsin A 
or carboxylesterase 1 and phosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 
followed by phosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation 
results in the formation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rephosphorylated and lacks anti-HCV activity in vitro. Within ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, GS-331007 
accounts for approximately 85% of total systemic exposure. 
Elimination 
Following a single 90 mg oral dose of [14C]-ledipasvir, mean total recovery of the [14C]-radioactivity 
in faeces and urine was 87%, with most of the radioactive dose recovered from faeces (86%). 
Unchanged ledipasvir excreted in faeces accounted for a mean of 70% of the administered dose and 
the oxidative metabolite M19 accounted for 2.2% of the dose. These data suggest that biliary excretion 
of unchanged ledipasvir is a major route of elimination with renal excretion being a minor pathway 
(approximately 1%). The median terminal half-life of ledipasvir in healthy volunteers following 
administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in the fasted state was 47 hours. 
Following a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the dose was greater 
than 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, faeces, and expired 
air, respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while 
3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir. This data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination 
pathway for GS-331007 with a large part actively secreted. The median terminal half-lives of 
sofosbuvir and GS-331007 following administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir were 0.5 and 27 hours, 
respectively. 
Neither ledipasvir nor sofosbuvir are substrates for hepatic uptake transporters, organic cation 
transporter (OCT) 1, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OATP1B3. GS-331007 is 
not a substrate for renal transporters including organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 or OAT3, or OCT2. 
In vitro potential for ledipasvir/sofosbuvir to affect other medicinal products 
At concentrations achieved in the clinic, ledipasvir is not an inhibitor of hepatic transporters including 
the OATP 1B1 or 1B3, BSEP, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, multidrug and toxic compound extrusion 
(MATE) 1 transporter, multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 2 or MRP4. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are 
not inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1 and 
GS-331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OCT2 and MATE1. 
Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors or inducers of CYP or uridine diphosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzymes. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Race and gender 
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to race have been identified for ledipasvir, 
sofosbuvir or GS-331007. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been 
identified for sofosbuvir or GS-331007. AUC and Cmax of ledipasvir were 77% and 58% higher, 
respectively, in females than males; however, the relationship between gender and ledipasvir 
exposures was not considered clinically relevant. 
Elderly 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients showed that within the age range (18 to 
80 years) analysed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to ledipasvir, 
sofosbuvir or GS-331007. Clinical studies of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir included 235 patients (8.6% of total 
number of patients) aged 65 years and over. 
Renal impairment

The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg ledipasvir in 
HCV negative adult patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault, 
median [range] CrCl 22 [17-29] mL/min).  
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied in HCV negative adult patients with mild (eGFR 
≥ 50 and < 80 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR ≥ 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe renal 
impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis following 
a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir,relative to patients with normal renal function (eGFR 
> 80 mL/min/1.73 m2). GS-331007 is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction 
coefficient of approximately 53%. Following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, a 4 hour 
haemodialysis removed 18% of administered sofosbuvir dose. 
In HCV-infected adult patients with severe renal impairment treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 
12 weeks (n = 18), the pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were consistent 
with that observed in HCV negative patients with severe renal impairment. 
The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were studied in HCV-infected adult 
patients with ESRD requiring dialysis treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (n=94) for 8, 12, or 24 weeks, 
and compared to patients without renal impairment in the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir Phase 2/3 trials. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg ledipasvir in 
HCV negative adult patients with severe hepatic impairment (CPT class C). Ledipasvir plasma 
exposure (AUCinf) was similar in patients with severe hepatic impairment and control patients with 
normal hepatic function. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected adult patients 
indicated that cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the 
exposure to ledipasvir. 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in 
HCV-infected adult patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT class B and C). 
Relative to patients with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC0-24 was 126% and 143% higher 
in moderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 18% and 9% higher, 
respectively. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected patients indicated that cirrhosis 
(including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir 
and GS-331007. 
Body weight 
Body weight did not have a significant effect on sofosbuvir exposure according to a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. Exposure to ledipasvir decreases with increasing body weight but the effect 
is not considered to be clinically relevant. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
Ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 exposures in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above were 
similar to those in adults from Phase 2/3 studies, following administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. 
The 90% confidence intervals of geometric least-squares mean ratios for all PK parameters of interest 
were contained within the predetermined similarity bounds of less than 2-fold (50% to 200%) with the 
exception of ledipasvir Ctau in paediatric patients 12 years and above which was 84% higher (90%CI: 
168% to 203%) and was not considered clinically relevant. 
The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 have not been established in 
paediatric patients aged < 3 years (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Ledipasvir 
No target organs of toxicity were identified in rat and dog studies with ledipasvir at AUC exposures 
approximately 7 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. 
Ledipasvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial 
mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo rat 
micronucleus assays. 
Ledipasvir was not carcinogenic in the 26-week rasH2 transgenic mouse and the 2-year rat 
carcinogenicity studies at exposures up to 26-times in mice and 8-times in rats higher than human 
exposure. 
Ledipasvir had no adverse effects on mating and fertility. In female rats, the mean number of corpora 
lutea and implantation sites were slightly reduced at maternal exposures 6-fold the exposure in humans 
at the recommended clinical dose. At the no observed effect level, AUC exposure to ledipasvir was 
approximately 7- and 3-fold, in males and females, respectively, the human exposure at the 
recommended clinical dose. 
No teratogenic effects were observed in rat and rabbit developmental toxicity studies with ledipasvir. 
In a rat pre- and postnatal study, at a maternally toxic dose, the developing rat offspring exhibited 
mean decreased body weight and body weight gain when exposed in utero (via maternal dosing) and 
during lactation (via maternal milk) at a maternal exposure 4 times the exposure in humans at the 
recommended clinical dose. There were no effects on survival, physical and behavioural development 
and reproductive performance in the offspring at maternal exposures similar to the exposure in humans 
at the recommended clinical dose. 
When administered to lactating rats, ledipasvir was detected in plasma of suckling rats likely due to 
excretion of ledipasvir via milk. 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that ledipasvir has the potential to be very 
persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) in the environment (see section 6.6). 
Sofosbuvir 
In repeat dose toxicology studies in rat and dog, high doses of the 1:1 diastereomeric mixture caused 
adverse liver (dog) and heart (rat) effects and gastrointestinal reactions (dog). Exposure to sofosbuvir 
in rodent studies could not be detected likely due to high esterase activity; however, exposure to the 
major metabolite GS-331007 at doses which cause adverse effects was 16 times (rat) and 71 times 
(dog) higher than the clinical exposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. No liver or heart findings were observed 
in chronic toxicity studies at exposures 5 times (rat) and 16 times (dog) higher than the clinical 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exposure. No liver or heart findings were observed in the 2-year carcinogenicity studies at exposures 
17 times (mouse) and 9 times (rat) higher than the clinical exposure. 
Sofosbuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial 
mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo mouse 
micronucleus assays. 
Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats do not indicate any carcinogenicity potential of sofosbuvir 
administered at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in mouse and 750 mg/kg/day in rat. Exposure to 
GS-331007 in these studies was up to 17 times (mouse) and 9 times (rat) higher than the clinical 
exposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. 
Sofosbuvir had no effects on embryo-foetal viability or on fertility in rat and was not teratogenic in rat 
and rabbit development studies. No adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction or development of 
offspring in rat were reported. In rabbit studies exposure to sofosbuvir was 6 times the expected 
clinical exposure. In the rat studies, exposure to sofosbuvir could not be determined but exposure 
margins based on the major human metabolite was approximately 5 times higher than the clinical 
exposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. 
Sofosbuvir-derived material was transferred through the placenta in pregnant rats and into the milk of 
lactating rats.

Starting dose of 600 mg, which can be titrated up to a maximum 
of 1,000/1,200 mg (1,000 mg for patients weighing < 75 kg and 
1,200 mg for patients weighing ≥ 75 kg) if well tolerated.  If the 
starting dose is not well tolerated, the dose should be reduced as 
clinically indicated based on haemoglobin levels 
* 
If a more normalized dose of ribavirin (by weight and renal function) cannot be reached for reasons of tolerability, 
24 weeks of Harvoni + ribavirin should be considered in order to minimize the risk for relapse. 
For adults when ribavirin is added to Harvoni, refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics of 
ribavirin. 
In paediatric patients aged 3 years and above the following ribavirin dosing is recommended where 
ribavirin is divided into two daily doses and given with food:

Dose modification of ribavirin in adults taking 1,000-1,200 mg daily 
If Harvoni is used in combination with ribavirin and a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially 
related to ribavirin, the ribavirin dose should be modified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the 
adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity. Table 5 provides guidelines for dose modifications 
and discontinuation based on the patient’s haemoglobin concentration and cardiac status.

Once ribavirin has been withheld due to either a laboratory abnormality or clinical manifestation, an 
attempt may be made to restart ribavirin at 600 mg daily and further increase the dose to 800 mg daily.  
However, it is not recommended that ribavirin be increased to the originally assigned dose (1,000 mg 
to 1,200 mg daily). 
Paediatric population aged < 3 years 
The safety and efficacy of Harvoni in paediatric patients aged < 3 years have not been established.  No 
data are available.

Missed dose 
Patients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 5 hours of dosing an additional dose 
should be taken.  If vomiting occurs more than 5 hours after dosing, no further dose is needed (see 
section 5.1). 
If a dose is missed and it is within 18 hours of the normal time, patients should be instructed to take 
the additional dose as soon as possible and then patients should take the next dose at the usual time. If 
it is after 18 hours then patients should be instructed to wait and take the next dose at the usual time.  
Patients should be instructed not to take a double dose. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is warranted for elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of Harvoni is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.   
Safety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. Harvoni can be 
used in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are available 
(see section 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of Harvoni is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte [CPT] class A, B or C) (see section 5.2). Safety and efficacy of 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir have been established in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (see section 5.1). 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Harvoni can be taken either with or without food. 
To help with swallowing of the Harvoni oral granules you can use food or water as detailed below. 
Alternatively, Harvoni can be swallowed without food or water. 
Taking Harvoni granules with food to aid swallowing 
To administer with food to aid swallowability of the granules, patients should be instructed to sprinkle 
the granules on one or more spoonfuls of non-acidic soft food at or below room temperature. Patients 
should be instructed to take the Harvoni granules within 30 minutes of gently mixing with food and to 
swallow the entire contents without chewing to avoid a bitter taste. Examples of non-acidic foods 
include chocolate syrup, mashed potato, and ice-cream.  
Taking Harvoni granules with water to aid swallowing 
To administer with water, patients should be instructed that the granules can be taken directly into the 
mouth and swallowed with water.  
Taking Harvoni granules without food or water 
To administer without food or water, patients should be instructed that the granules can be taken 
directly into the mouth and swallowed. Patients should be instructed to swallow the entire contents 
without chewing (see section 5.2). 
4.3 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Co-administration with rosuvastatin (see section 4.5). 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use with strong P-gp inducers 
Medicinal products that are strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducers in the intestine (carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort). Co-administration will 
significantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and could result in loss of 
efficacy of Harvoni (see section 4.5). 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Harvoni should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing 
sofosbuvir. 
Genotype-specific activity 
Concerning recommended regimens with different HCV genotypes, see section 4.2. Concerning 
genotype-specific virological and clinical activity, see section 5.1. 
The clinical data to support the use of Harvoni in adults infected with HCV genotype 3 are limited (see 
section 5.1). The relative efficacy of a 12-week regimen consisting of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
+ ribavirin, compared to a 24-week regimen of sofosbuvir + ribavirin has not been investigated. A 
conservative 24 weeks of therapy is advised in all treatment-experienced genotype 3 patients and those 
treatment-naïve genotype 3 patients with cirrhosis (see section 4.2). In genotype 3-infection, the use of 
Harvoni (always in combination with ribavirin) should only be considered for patients who are 
deemed at high risk for clinical disease progression and who do not have alternative treatment options. 
The clinical data to support the use of Harvoni in adults infected with HCV genotype 2 and 6 are 
limited (see section 5.1). 
Severe bradycardia and heart block 
Life-threatening cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir-
containing regimens are used in combination with amiodarone. Bradycardia has generally occurred 
within hours to days, but cases with a longer time to onset have been observed mostly up to 2 weeks 
after initiating HCV treatment. 
Amiodarone should only be used in patients on Harvoni when other alternative anti-arrhythmic 
treatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. 
Should concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary it is recommended that patients 
undergo cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration, after 
which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the 
first 2 weeks of treatment. 
Due to the long half-life of amiodarone, cardiac monitoring as outlined above should also be carried 
out for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated 
on Harvoni. 
All patients with concurrent or recent use of amiodarone should be warned of the symptoms of 
bradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they 
experience them. 
Use in diabetic patients  
Diabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct-acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic 
patients initiating direct-acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
first 3 months, and their diabetic medication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the 
diabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct-acting antiviral therapy is initiated. 
HCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection 
Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after 
treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before 
initiation of treatment.  HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should 
therefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. 
Treatment of patients with prior exposure to HCV direct-acting antivirals 
In patients who fail treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, selection of NS5A resistance mutations that 
substantially reduce the susceptibility to ledipasvir is seen in the majority of cases (see section 5.1). 
Limited data indicate that such NS5A mutations do not revert on long-term follow-up.  There are 
presently no data to support the effectiveness of retreatment of patients who have failed 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with a subsequent regimen that contains an NS5A inhibitor. Similarly, there are 
presently no data to support the effectiveness of NS3/4A protease inhibitors in patients who previously 
failed prior therapy that included an NS3/4A protease inhibitor. Such patients may therefore be 
dependent on other classes of medicinal products for clearance of HCV infection. Consequently, 
consideration should be given to longer treatment for patients with uncertain subsequent retreatment 
options. 
Renal impairment 
Safety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and ESRD requiring haemodialysis. Harvoni can be used in these 
patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are available (see 
sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). When Harvoni is used in combination with ribavirin refer also to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) 
< 50 mL/min (see section 5.2). 
Adults with decompensated cirrhosis and/or who are awaiting liver transplant or post-liver transplant 
The efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in genotype 5 and genotype 6 HCV-infected patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis and/or who are awaiting liver transplant or post-liver transplant has not been 
investigated. Treatment with Harvoni should be guided by an assessment of the potential benefits and 
risks for the individual patient. 
Use with moderate P-gp inducers 
Medicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g. oxcarbazepine) may decrease 
ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Harvoni.  
Co-administration of such medicinal products is not recommended with Harvoni (see section 4.5). 
Use with certain HIV antiretroviral regimens 
Harvoni has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure, especially when used together with an HIV 
regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or 
cobicistat). The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the setting of Harvoni and a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established. The potential risks and benefits associated with 
co-administration of Harvoni with the fixed-dose combination tablet containing 
elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
given in conjunction with a boosted HIV protease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be 
considered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving Harvoni 
concomitantly with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or with 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for tenofovir-
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
associated adverse reactions. Refer to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate, or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Summary of Product 
Characteristics for recommendations on renal monitoring. 
Use with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 
Co-administration of Harvoni and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can significantly increase 
the concentration of the statin, which increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (see 
section 4.5). 
Paediatric population 
Harvoni is not recommended for use in paediatric patients aged < 3 years because the safety and 
efficacy have not been established in this population. 
Excipients 
Harvoni contains the azo colouring agent sunset yellow FCF (E110), which may cause allergic 
reactions. It also contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
As Harvoni contains ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, any interactions that have been identified with these 
active substances individually may occur with Harvoni. 
Potential for Harvoni to affect other medicinal products 
Ledipasvir is an in vitro inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) 
and may increase intestinal absorption of co-administered substrates for these transporters.   
Potential for other medicinal products to affect Harvoni 
Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir are substrates of drug transporter P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. 
Medicinal products that are strong P-gp inducers (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort) may significantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma 
concentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and thus are 
contraindicated with Harvoni (see section 4.3). Medicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers in 
the intestine (e.g. oxcarbazepine) may decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations 
leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Harvoni. Co-administration with such medicinal products is 
not recommended with Harvoni (see section 4.4). Co-administration with medicinal products that 
inhibit P-gp and/or BCRP may increase ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations without 
increasing GS-331007 plasma concentration; Harvoni may be co-administered with P-gp and/or 
BCRP inhibitors.  Clinically significant medicinal product interactions with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
mediated by CYP450s or UGT1A1 enzymes are not expected. 
Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists 
As liver function may change during treatment with Harvoni, a close monitoring of International 
Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Impact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver 
The pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. immunosuppressive agents such 
as calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in liver function during DAA therapy, related to

Interactions between Harvoni and other medicinal products 
Table 6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product 
interactions (where 90% confidence interval [CI] of the geometric least-squares mean [GLSM] ratio 
were within “↔”, extended above “↑”, or extended below “↓” the predetermined equivalence 
boundaries). The medicinal product interactions described are based on studies conducted with either 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as individual agents, or are predicted medicinal 
product interactions that may occur with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. The table is not all-inclusive. 
Table 6: Interactions between Harvoni and other medicinal products 
Recommendation concerning co-administration 
with Harvoni 
Ledipasvir solubility decreases as pH increases.  
Medicinal products that increase gastric pH are 
expected to decrease concentration of ledipasvir. 
It is recommended to separate antacid and Harvoni 
administration by 4 hours. 
H2-receptor antagonists may be administered 
simultaneously with or staggered from Harvoni at a 
dose that does not exceed doses comparable to 
famotidine 40 mg twice daily.

Recommendation concerning co-administration 
with Harvoni 
Proton pump inhibitor doses comparable to 
omeprazole 20 mg can be administered 
simultaneously with Harvoni. Proton pump 
inhibitors should not be taken before Harvoni. 
Coadministration of amiodarone with a sofosbuvir-
containing regimen may result in serious 
symptomatic bradycardia.  
Use only if no other alternative is available. Close 
monitoring is recommended if this medicinal 
product is administered with Harvoni (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Co-administration of Harvoni with digoxin may 
increase the concentration of digoxin. Caution is 
warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring 
of digoxin is recommended when co-administered 
with Harvoni. 
Clinical monitoring, looking for signs of bleeding 
and anaemia, is recommended when dabigatran 
etexilate is co-administered with Harvoni. A 
coagulation test helps to identify patients with an 
increased bleeding risk due to increased dabigatran 
exposure. 
Close monitoring of INR is recommended with all 
vitamin K antagonists. This is due to liver function 
changes during treatment with Harvoni. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recommendation concerning co-administration 
with Harvoni 
Harvoni is contraindicated with phenobarbital and 
phenytoin (see section 4.3). 
Harvoni is contraindicated with carbamazepine (see 
section 4.3). 
Co-administration of Harvoni with oxcarbazepine is 
expected to decrease the concentration of ledipasvir 
and sofosbuvir leading to reduced therapeutic effect 
of Harvoni. Such co-administration is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
Harvoni is contraindicated with rifampicin (see 
section 4.3).

Recommendation concerning co-administration 
with Harvoni 
When given with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate used 
in conjunction with atazanavir/ritonavir, Harvoni 
increased the concentration of tenofovir. 
The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the 
setting of Harvoni and a pharmacokinetic enhancer 
(e.g. ritonavir or cobicistat) has not been 
established. 
The combination should be used with caution with 
frequent renal monitoring, if other alternatives are 
not available (see section 4.4). 
Atazanavir concentrations are also increased, with a 
risk for an increase in bilirubin levels/icterus. That 
risk is even higher if ribavirin is used as part of the 
HCV treatment. 
No dose adjustment of Harvoni or darunavir 
(ritonavir boosted) is required.

When given with elvitegravir/ cobicistat/ 
emtricitabine/ tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 
Harvoni is expected to increase the concentration of 
tenofovir. 
The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the 
setting of Harvoni and a pharmacokinetic enhancer 
(e.g. ritonavir or cobicistat) has not been 
established. 
The combination should be used with caution with 
frequent renal monitoring, if other alternatives are 
not available (see section 4.4). 
No dose adjustment required. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recommendation concerning co-administration 
with Harvoni 
Harvoni is contraindicated with St. John’s wort (see 
section 4.3). 
Co-administration of Harvoni with rosuvastatin may 
significantly increase the concentration of 
rosuvastatin (several fold-increase in AUC) which 
is associated with increased risk of myopathy, 
including rhabdomyolysis. Co-administration of 
Harvoni with rosuvastatin is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Co-administration of Harvoni with pravastatin may 
significantly increase the concentration of 
pravastatin which is associated with increased risk 
of myopathy. Clinical and biochemical control is 
recommended in these patients and a dose 
adjustment may be needed (see section 4.4). 
Interactions cannot be excluded with other 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. When 
co-administered with Harvoni, a reduced dose of 
statins should be considered and careful monitoring 
for statin adverse reactions should be undertaken 
(see section 4.4). 
No dose adjustment of Harvoni or methadone is 
required.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / contraception in males and females 
When Harvoni is used in combination with ribavirin, extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy 
in female patients and in female partners of male patients. Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal 
effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. Women of childbearing 
potential or their male partners must use an effective form of contraception during treatment and for a 
period of time after the treatment has concluded as recommended in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for ribavirin. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for 
additional information. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ledipasvir, 
sofosbuvir or Harvoni in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. No 
significant effects on foetal development have been observed with ledipasvir or sofosbuvir in rats and 
rabbits. However, it has not been possible to fully estimate exposure margins achieved for sofosbuvir 
in the rat relative to the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Harvoni during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether ledipasvir or sofosbuvir and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals has shown excretion of ledipasvir and metabolites of 
sofosbuvir in milk (see section 5.3). 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Therefore, Harvoni should not be used during 
breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of Harvoni on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate 
harmful effects of ledipasvir or sofosbuvir on fertility. 
If ribavirin is co-administered with Harvoni, the contraindications regarding use of ribavirin during 
pregnancy and breast-feeding apply (see also the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Harvoni (administered alone or in combination with ribavirin) has no or negligible influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines. However, patients should be advised that fatigue was more common 
in patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir compared to placebo.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile in adults 
The safety assessment of Harvoni was mainly based on pooled Phase 3 clinical studies, without a 
control, in 1952 patients who received Harvoni for 8, 12 or 24 weeks, including 872 patients who 
received Harvoni in combination with ribavirin. 
The proportion of patients who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0%, 
< 1% and 1% for patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 8, 12 and 24 weeks, respectively; and 
< 1%, 0%, and 2% for patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin combination therapy for 8, 
12 and 24 weeks, respectively. 
In clinical studies, fatigue and headache were more common in patients treated with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir compared to placebo. When ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was studied with ribavirin, the 
most frequent adverse drug reactions to ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin combination therapy were 
consistent with the known safety profile of ribavirin, without increasing the frequency or severity of 
the expected adverse drug reactions. 
Tabulated list of adverse events 
The following adverse drug reactions have been identified with Harvoni (Table 7). The adverse 
reactions are listed below by body system organ class and frequency.  Frequencies are defined as 
follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) or very rare (< 1/10,000).

Adults with decompensated cirrhosis and/or who are awaiting liver transplant or post-liver transplant 
The safety profile of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks in adults with 
decompensated liver disease and/or those post-liver transplant was assessed in two open-label studies 
(SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2). No new adverse drug reactions were detected among patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis and/or who were post-liver transplant and who received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
with ribavirin. Although adverse events, including serious adverse events, occurred more frequently in 
this study compared to studies that excluded decompensated patients and/or patients who were post-
liver transplantation, the adverse events observed were those expected as clinical sequelae of advanced 
liver disease and/or transplantation or were consistent with the known safety profile of ribavirin (see 
section 5.1 for details of this study). 
Decreases in haemoglobin to < 10 g/dL and < 8.5 g/dL during treatment were experienced by 39% and 
13% of patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin, respectively. Ribavirin was 
discontinued in 15% of the patients. 
7% of liver transplant recipients had a modification of their immunosuppressive agents.

Patients with renal impairment 
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was administered for 12 weeks to 18 patients with genotype 1 CHC and severe 
renal impairment in an open-label study (Study 0154). In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate 
of adverse events was not clearly elevated from what is expected in patients with severe renal 
impairment. 
The safety of Harvoni has been evaluated in a 12-week non-controlled study including 95 patients 
with ESRD requiring dialysis (Study 4063). In this setting, exposure of sofosbuvir metabolite GS-
331007 is 20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse reactions have been observed in 
preclinical trials. In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events and deaths was not 
clearly elevated from what is expected in ESRD patients. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Harvoni in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above are based on data 
from a Phase 2, open-label clinical study (Study 1116) that enrolled 226 patients who were treated 
with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 or 24 weeks or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24 weeks.  
The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in adults (see Table 7). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Cardiac arrhythmias 
Cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when Harvoni is used with 
amiodarone and/or other drugs that lower heart rate (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Skin disorders 
Frequency not known: Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
The highest documented doses of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir were 120 mg twice daily for 10 days and a 
single dose of 1,200 mg, respectively. In these healthy volunteer studies, there were no untoward 
effects observed at these dose levels, and adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity to 
those reported in the placebo groups. The effects of higher doses are not known. 
No specific antidote is available for overdose with Harvoni.  If overdose occurs the patient must be 
monitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with Harvoni consists of general supportive 
measures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. 
Haemodialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of ledipasvir as ledipasvir is highly bound to 
plasma protein. Haemodialysis can efficiently remove the predominant circulating metabolite of 
sofosbuvir, GS-331007, with an extraction ratio of 53%.

60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Ledipasvir is a HCV inhibitor targeting the HCV NS5A protein, which is essential for both RNA 
replication and the assembly of HCV virions. Biochemical confirmation of NS5A inhibition by 
ledipasvir is not currently possible as NS5A has no enzymatic function. In vitro resistance selection 
and cross-resistance studies indicate ledipasvir targets NS5A as its mode of action. 
Sofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is 
essential for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular 
metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analogue triphosphate (GS-461203), which 
can be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator.  
GS-461203 (the active metabolite of sofosbuvir) is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and 
RNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. 
Antiviral activity 
The EC50 values of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir against full-length or chimeric replicons encoding NS5A 
and NS5B sequences from clinical isolates are detailed in Table 8. The presence of 40% human serum 
had no effect on the anti-HCV activity of sofosbuvir but reduced the anti-HCV activity of ledipasvir 
by 12-fold against genotype 1a HCV replicons.

Resistance 
In cell culture 
HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir have been selected in cell culture for 
genotype 1a and 1b. Reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir was associated with the primary NS5A 
substitution Y93H in both genotype 1a and 1b. Additionally a Q30E substitution developed in 
genotype 1a replicons.  Site-directed mutagenesis of NS5A RAVs showed that substitutions conferring 
a fold-change > 100 and ≤ 1,000 in ledipasvir susceptibility are Q30H/R, L31I/M/V, P32L and Y93T 
in genotype 1a and P58D and Y93S in genotype 1b; and substitutions conferring a fold-change 
> 1,000 are M28A/G, Q30E/G/K, H58D, Y93C/H/N/S in genotype 1a and A92K and Y93H in 
genotype 1b. 
HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell culture for multiple 
genotypes including 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a.  Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated 
with the primary NS5B substitution S282T in all replicon genotypes examined. Site-directed 
mutagenesis of the S282T substitution in replicons of 8 genotypes conferred 2- to 18-fold reduced 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
susceptibility to sofosbuvir and reduced the viral replication capacity by 89% to 99% compared to the 
corresponding wild-type. 
In clinical studies – Adults-Genotype 1 
In a pooled analysis of patients who received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in Phase 3 studies (ION-3, ION-1 
and ION-2), 37 patients (29 with genotype 1a and 8 with genotype 1b) qualified for resistance analysis 
due to virologic failure or early study drug discontinuation and having HCV RNA > 1,000 IU/mL.  
Post-baseline NS5A and NS5B deep sequencing data (assay cut off of 1%) were available for 37/37 
and 36/37 patients, respectively. 
NS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs) were observed in post-baseline isolates from 
29/37 patients (22/29 genotype 1a and 7/8 genotype 1b) not achieving sustained virologic response 
(SVR). Of the 29 genotype 1a patients who qualified for resistance testing, 22/29 (76%) patients 
harboured one or more NS5A RAVs at positions K24, M28, Q30, L31, S38 and Y93 at failure, while 
the remaining 7/29 patients had no NS5A RAVs detected at failure. The most common variants were 
Q30R, Y93H and L31M.  Of the 8 genotype 1b patients who qualified for resistance testing, 7/8 (88%) 
harboured one or more NS5A RAVs at positions L31 and Y93 at failure, while 1/8 patients had no 
NS5A RAVs at failure. The most common variant was Y93H.  Among the 8 patients who had no 
NS5A RAVs at failure, 7 patients received 8 weeks of treatment (n = 3 with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir; 
n = 4 with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin) and 1 patient received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. 
In phenotypic analyses, post-baseline isolates from patients who harboured NS5A RAVs at failure 
showed 20- to at least a 243-fold (the highest dose tested) reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir. 
Site-directed mutagenesis of the Y93H substitution in both genotype 1a and 1b as well as the Q30R 
and L31M substitution in genotype 1a conferred high levels of reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir 
(fold-change in EC50 ranging from 544-fold to 1,677-fold). 
Among post-transplant patients with compensated liver disease or patients with decompensated liver 
disease either pre- or post-transplant (SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies), relapse was associated with 
the detection of one or more of the following NS5A RAVs: K24R, M28T, Q30R/H/K, L31V, H58D 
and Y93H/C in 12/14 genotype 1a patients, and L31M, Y93H/N in 6/6 genotype 1b patients. 
A NS5B substitution E237G was detected in 3 patients (1 genotype 1b and 2 genotype 1a) in the 
Phase 3 studies (ION-3, ION-1 and ION-2) and 3 patients with genotype 1a infection in the SOLAR-1 
and SOLAR-2 studies at the time of relapse. The E237G substitution showed a 1.3-fold reduction in 
susceptibility to sofosbuvir in the genotype 1a replicon assay. The clinical significance of this 
substitution is currently unknown. 
The sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T in NS5B was not detected in any virologic 
failure isolate from the Phase 3 studies.  However, the NS5B S282T substitution in combination with 
NS5A substitutions L31M, Y93H and Q30L were detected in one patient at failure following 8 weeks 
of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir from a Phase 2 study (LONESTAR). This patient was 
subsequently retreated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 24 weeks and achieved SVR 
following retreatment. 
In the SIRIUS study (see “Clinical efficacy and safety”, below) 5 patients with genotype 1 infection 
relapsed after treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin.  NS5A RAVs were seen 
at relapse in 5/5 patients (for genotype 1a: Q30R/H + L31M/V [n = 1] and Q30R [n = 1]; for 
genotype 1b: Y93H [n = 3]). 
In clinical studies – Adults-Genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 
NS5A RAVs: No genotype 2 infected patients experienced relapse in the clinical study and therefore 
there are no data regarding NS5A RAVs at the time of failure. 
In genotype 3 infected patients experiencing virologic failure, development of NS5A RAVs (including 
enrichment of RAVs present at baseline) was typically not detected at the time of failure (n = 17). 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In genotype 4, 5 and 6 infection, only small numbers of patients have been evaluated (total of 
5 patients with failure). The NS5A substitution Y93C emerged in the HCV of 1 patient (genotype 4), 
while NS5A RAVs present at baseline were observed at the time of failure in all patients. In the 
SOLAR-2 study, one patient with genotype 4d developed NS5B substitution E237G at the time of 
relapse. The clinical significance of this substitution is currently unknown. 
NS5B RAVs: The NS5B substitution S282T emerged in the HCV of 1/17 genotype 3-failures, and in 
the HCV of 1/3, 1/1 and 1/1 of genotype 4-, 5- and 6-failures, respectively. 
Effect of baseline HCV resistance-associated variants on treatment outcome 
Adults-Genotype 1 
Analyses were conducted to explore the association between pre-existing baseline NS5A RAVs and 
treatment outcome. In the pooled analysis of the Phase 3 studies, 16% of patients had baseline 
NS5A RAVs identified by population or deep sequencing irrespective of subtype. Baseline 
NS5A RAVs were overrepresented in patients who experienced relapse in the Phase 3 studies (see 
“Clinical efficacy and safety”). 
Following 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (without ribavirin) in treatment-
experienced patients (arm 1 of ION-2 study) 4/4 patients with baseline NS5A RAVs conferring a 
ledipasvir fold-change of ≤ 100 achieved SVR. For the same treatment arm, patients with baseline 
NS5A RAVs conferring a fold-change of > 100, relapse occurred in 4/13 (31%), as compared to 3/95 
(3%) in those without any baseline RAVs or RAVs conferring a fold-change of ≤ 100. 
Following 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin in treatment-experienced 
patients with compensated cirrhosis (SIRIUS, n = 77), 8/8 patients with baseline NS5A RAVs 
conferring > 100-fold reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir achieved SVR12. 
Among post-transplant patients with compensated liver disease (SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies), no 
relapse occurred in patients with baseline NS5A RAVs (n = 23) following 12 weeks of treatment with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin. Among patients with decompensated liver disease (pre- and post-
transplant), 4/16 (25%) patients with NS5A RAVs conferring > 100-fold resistance relapsed after 
12 weeks treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin compared to 7/120 (6%) in those without 
any baseline NS5A RAVs or RAVs conferring a fold-change of ≤ 100. 
The group of NS5A RAVs that conferred > 100-fold shift and was observed in patients were the 
following substitutions in genotype 1a (M28A, Q30H/R/E, L31M/V/I, H58D, Y93H/N/C) or in 
genotype 1b (Y93H). The proportion of such baseline NS5A RAVs seen with deep sequencing varied 
from very low (cut off for assay = 1%) to high (main part of the plasma population). 
The sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T was not detected in the baseline NS5B 
sequence of any patient in Phase 3 studies by population or deep sequencing.  SVR was achieved in all 
24 patients (n = 20 with L159F+C316N; n = 1 with L159F; and n = 3 with N142T) who had baseline 
variants associated with resistance to NS5B nucleoside inhibitors. 
Adults-Genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 
Due to the limited size of studies, the impact of baseline NS5A RAVs on treatment outcome for 
patients with genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 CHC has not been fully evaluated. No major differences in 
outcomes were observed by the presence or absence of baseline NS5A RAVs. 
Paediatric Patients 
The presence of pre-treatment NS5A and/or NS5B RAVs did not impact treatment outcome as all 
subjects with pre-treatment RAVs achieved SVR12 and SVR24. One 8-year-old subject infected with 
genotype 1a HCV who failed to achieve SVR12 had no NS5A or NS5B nucleoside inhibitor RAVs at 
baseline and had emergent NS5A RAV Y93H at relapse. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cross-resistance 
Ledipasvir was fully active against the sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T in NS5B 
while all ledipasvir resistance-associated substitutions in NS5A were fully susceptible to sofosbuvir. 
Both sofosbuvir and ledipasvir were fully active against substitutions associated with resistance to 
other classes of direct-acting antivirals with different mechanisms of actions, such as NS5B 
non-nucleoside inhibitors and NS3 protease inhibitors. NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to 
ledipasvir may reduce the antiviral activity of other NS5A inhibitors. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of ledipasvir [LDV]/sofosbuvir [SOF] was evaluated in three open-label Phase 3 studies 
with data available for a total of 1,950 patients with genotype 1 CHC. The three Phase 3 studies 
included one study conducted in non-cirrhotic treatment-naïve patients (ION-3); one study in cirrhotic 
and non-cirrhotic treatment-naïve patients (ION-1); and one study in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic 
patients who failed prior therapy with an interferon-based regimen, including regimens containing an 
HCV protease inhibitor (ION-2). Patients in these studies had compensated liver disease. All three 
Phase 3 studies evaluated the efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin. 
Treatment duration was fixed in each study.  Serum HCV RNA values were measured during the 
clinical studies using the COBAS TaqMan HCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System.  
The assay had a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU/mL. SVR was the primary endpoint to 
determine the HCV cure rate which was defined as HCV RNA less than LLOQ at 12 weeks after the 
cessation of treatment. 
Treatment-naïve adults without cirrhosis – ION-3 (study 0108) – Genotype 1 
ION-3 evaluated 8 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin and 
12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic patients with 
genotype 1 CHC. Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups and 
stratified by HCV genotype (1a versus 1b).

Table 16 presents relapse rates with the 12-week regimens (with or without ribavirin) for selected 
subgroups (see also previous section “Effect of baseline HCV resistance-associated variants on 
treatment outcome”). In non-cirrhotic patients relapses only occurred in the presence of baseline 
NS5A RAVs, and during therapy with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin. In cirrhotic patients 
relapses occurred with both regimens, and in the absence and presence of baseline NS5A RAVs.

Previously treated adults with cirrhosis – SIRIUS – Genotype 1 
SIRIUS included patients with compensated cirrhosis who first failed therapy with pegylated 
interferon (PEG-IFN) + ribavirin, and then failed a regimen consisting of a pegylated 
interferon + ribavirin + an NS3/4A protease inhibitor. Cirrhosis was defined by biopsy, Fibroscan 
(> 12.5 kPa) or FibroTest > 0.75 and an AST:platelet ratio index (APRI) of > 2. 
The study (double-blind and placebo-controlled) evaluated 24 weeks of treatment 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (with ribavirin placebo) versus 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
with ribavirin. Patients in the latter treatment arm received placebo (for ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and 
ribavirin) during the first 12 weeks, followed by active blinded therapy during the subsequent 
12 weeks. Patients were stratified by HCV genotype (1a versus 1b) and prior treatment response 
(whether HCV RNA < LLOQ had been achieved). 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across the two treatment groups. The 
median age was 56 years (range: 23 to 77); 74% of patients were male; 97% were white; 63% had 
genotype 1a HCV infection; 94% had non-CC IL28B alleles (CT or TT). 
Of the 155 patients enrolled, 1 patient discontinued treatment whilst on placebo. Of the remaining 
154 patients, a total of 149 achieved SVR12 across both treatment groups; 96% (74/77) of patients in 
the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin 12-week group and 97% (75/77) of patients in the 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 24-week group. All 5 patients who did not achieve SVR12 relapsed after having 
end-of-treatment response (see section “Resistance” – “In clinical studies” above). 
Previously treated adults who have failed on sofosbuvir + ribavirin ± PEG-IFN 
The efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in patients who had previously failed treatment with sofosbuvir + 
ribavirin ± PEG-IFN is supported by two clinical studies. In study 1118, 44 patients with genotype 1 
infection, including 12 cirrhotic patients, who had previously failed treatment with sofosbuvir + 
ribavirin + PEG-IFN or with sofosbuvir + ribavirin were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin 
for 12 weeks; the SVR was 100% (44/44). In study ION-4, 13 HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients with 
genotype 1, including 1 cirrhotic patient, who had failed a sofosbuvir + ribavirin regimen were 
enrolled; the SVR was 100% (13/13) after 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. 
HCV/HIV co-infected adults – ION-4 
ION-4 was an open-label clinical study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment 
with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin in HCV treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients with genotype 1 or 4 CHC who were co-infected with HIV-1. Treatment-experienced patients 
had failed prior treatment with PEG-IFN + ribavirin ± an HCV protease inhibitor or sofosbuvir + 
ribavirin ± PEG-IFN.  Patients were on a stable HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy that included 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, administered with efavirenz, rilpivirine or raltegravir. 
The median age was 52 years (range: 26 to 72); 82% of the patients were male; 61% were white; 34% 
were black; 75% had genotype 1a HCV infection; 2% had genotype 4 infection; 76% had non-CC 
IL28B alleles (CT or TT); and 20% had compensated cirrhosis.  Fifty-five percent (55%) of the 
patients were treatment-experienced.

HCV/HIV co-infected adults – ERADICATE 
ERADICATE was an open-label study to evaluate 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in 
50 patients with genotype 1 CHC co-infected with HIV. All patients were treatment-naïve to HCV 
therapy without cirrhosis, 26% (13/50) of patients were HIV antiretroviral naïve and 74% (37/50) of 
patients were receiving concomitant HIV antiretroviral therapy. At the time of the interim analysis 
40 patients have reached 12 weeks post treatment and SVR12 was 98% (39/40). 
Patients awaiting liver transplantation and post-liver transplant – SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 
SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 were two open-label clinical studies that evaluated 12 and 24 weeks of 
treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin in genotype 1 and 4 HCV-infected 
patients who have undergone liver transplantation and/or who have decompensated liver disease. The 
two studies were identical in study design. Patients were enrolled in one of the seven groups based on 
liver transplantation status and severity of hepatic impairment (see Table 18). Patients with a CPT 
score > 12 were excluded. Within each group, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across the treatment groups. Of the 670 
treated patients, the median age was 59 years (range: 21 to 81 years); 77% of the patients were male; 
91% were White; mean body mass index was 28 kg/m2 (range: 18 to 49 kg/m2); 94% and 6% had 
genotype 1 and 4 HCV infection, respectively; 78% of the patients failed a prior HCV therapy.  
Among the patients who had decompensated cirrhosis (pre- or post-transplant), 64% and 36% were 
CPT class B and C at screening, respectively, 24% had a baseline Model for End Stage Liver Disease 
(MELD) score greater than 15.

Forty patients with genotype 4 CHC were enrolled in SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies, SVR12 were 
92% (11/12) and 100% (10/10) in post-transplant patients without decompensated cirrhosis and 60% 
(6/10) and 75% (6/8) in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (pre- and post-liver transplantation) 
treated for 12 or 24 weeks, respectively. Of the 7 patients who failed to achieve SVR12, 3 relapsed, all 
had decompensated cirrhosis and were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks. 
Changes in MELD and CPT score from baseline to post-treatment Week 12 were analyzed for all 
patients with decompensated cirrhosis (pre- or post-transplant) who achieved SVR12 and for whom 
data were available (n = 123) to assess the effect of SVR12 on hepatic function. 
Change in MELD score: Among those who achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks treatment with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin, 57% (70/123) and 19% (23/123) had an improvement or no change 
in MELD score from baseline to post-treatment week 12, respectively; of the 32 patients whose 
MELD score was ≥ 15 at baseline, 59% (19/32) had a MELD score < 15 at post-treatment Week 12. 
The improvement in MELD scores observed was driven largely by improvements in total bilirubin. 
Change in CPT score and class: Among those who achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks treatment with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin, 60% (74/123) and 34% (42/123) had an improvement or no 
change of CPT scores from baseline to post-treatment week 12, respectively; of the 32 patients who 
had CPT C cirrhosis at baseline, 53% (17/32) had CPT B cirrhosis at post-treatment Week 12; of the 
88 patients who had CPT B cirrhosis at baseline, 25% (22/88) had CPT A cirrhosis at post-treatment 
Week 12.  The improvement in CPT scores observed was driven largely by improvements in total 
bilirubin and albumin. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (see also section 4.4) 
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir has been evaluated for the treatment of non-genotype 1 infection in small 
Phase 2 studies, as summarised below. 
The clinical studies enrolled patients with or without cirrhosis, who were treatment-naïve or with prior 
treatment failure after therapy with PEG-IFN + ribavirin +/- an HCV protease inhibitor. 
For genotype 2, 4, 5 and 6 infection, therapy consisted of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin, 
given for 12 weeks (Table 19). For genotype 3 infection, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was given with or 
without ribavirin, also for 12 weeks (Table 20).

Patients with renal impairment 
Study 0154 was an open-label clinical study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of 
treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in 18 genotype 1 HCV-infected patients with severe renal 
impairment not requiring dialysis. At baseline, two patients had cirrhosis and the mean eGFR was 
24.9 mL/min (range: 9.0-39.6). SVR12 was achieved in 18/18 patients. 
Study 4063 was an open-label three-arm clinical study that evaluated 8, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment 
with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in a total of 95 patients with genotype 1 (72%), 2 (22%), 4 (2%), 5 (1%), or 
6 (2%) CHC and ESRD requiring dialysis: 45 treatment-naïve genotype 1 HCV-infected patients 
without cirrhosis received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 8 weeks; 31 treatment-experienced genotype 1 
HCV-infected patients and treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced patients with genotype 2, 5, and 
6 infection without cirrhosis received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks; and 19 genotype 1, 2, and 4 
HCV-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 24 weeks.  Of 
the 95 total patients, at baseline, 20% of patients had cirrhosis, 22% were treatment experienced, 21% 
had received a kidney transplant, 92% were on hemodialysis, and 8% were on peritoneal dialysis; 
mean duration on dialysis was 11.5 years (range: 0.2 to 43.0 years).  The SVR rates for the 8, 12, and 
24 week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment groups were 93% (42/45), 100% (31/31), and 79% (15/19), 
respectively. Of the seven patients who did not achieve SVR12, none experienced virologic failure or 
relapsed. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in HCV infected patients aged 3  years and above was evaluated 
in a Phase 2, open label clinical study that enrolled 226 patients, 221 patients with genotype 1, 2 
patients with genotype 3, and 3 patients with genotype 4 CHC (Study 1116) (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).   
Patients aged 12 to < 18 Years: 
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was evaluated in 100 patients aged 12 to < 18 years with genotype 1 
HCV-infection. A total of 80 patients (n=80) were treatment-naïve, while 20 patients (n=20) were 
treatment-experienced. All patients were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment-naïve and 
treatment-experienced patients. The median age was 15 years (range: 12 to 17); 63% of the patients 
were female; 91% were White, 7% were Black, and 2% were Asian; 13% were Hispanic/Latino; mean 
weight was 61.3 kg (range: 33.0 to 126.0 kg); 55% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or 
equal to 800,000 IU/mL; 81% had genotype 1a HCV infection; and 1 patient who was treatment naïve 
was known to have cirrhosis. The majority of patients (84%) had been infected through vertical 
transmission. 
The SVR12 rate was 98% overall (98% [78/80] in treatment-naïve patients and 100% [20/20] in 
treatment experienced patients). A total of 2 out of 100 patients (2%), both treatment- naïve, did not 
achieve SVR12 (due to loss to follow-up). No patient experienced virologic failure. 
Patients aged 6 to < 12 Years:  
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was evaluated in 92 patients aged 6 to < 12 years with genotype 1, 3, or 4 
HCV-infection. A total of 72 patients (78%) were treatment-naïve and 20 patients (22%) were 
treatment-experienced. Eighty-nine of the patients (87 patients with genotype 1 HCV infection and 2 
patients with genotype 4 HCV infection) were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, 1 
treatment experienced patient with genotype 1 HCV infection and cirrhosis was treated with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, and 2 treatment experienced patients with genotype 3 HCV 
infection were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24 weeks. The median age was 9 
years (range: 6 to 11); 59% of the patients were male; 79% were White, 8% were Black, and 5% were 
Asian; 10% were Hispanic/Latino; mean weight was 32.8 kg (range: 17.5 to 76.4 kg); 59% had 
baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; 84% had genotype 1a HCV 
infection; 2 patients (1 treatment-naïve, 1 treatment-experienced) had known cirrhosis. The majority of 
patients (97%) had been infected through vertical transmission.  
The SVR rate was 99% overall (99% [88/89], 100% [1/1], and 100% [2/2] in patients treated with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus 
ribavirin for 24 weeks, respectively). The one treatment-naïve patient with genotype 1 HCV infection 
and cirrhosis who was treated with Harvoni for 12 weeks did not achieve SVR12 and relapsed.  
Patients aged 3 to <6 Years:  
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was evaluated in 34 patients aged 3 to < 6 years with genotype 1 (n = 33) or 
genotype 4 (n = 1) HCV-infection. All of the patients were treatment-naïve and treated with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. The median age was 5 years (range: 3 to 5); 71% of the patients 
were female; 79% were White, 3% were Black, and 6% were Asian; 18% were Hispanic/Latino; mean 
weight was 19.2 kg (range: 10.7 to 33.6 kg); 56% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal 
800,000 IU/mL; 82% had genotype 1a HCV infection; no patients had known cirrhosis. All patients 
(100%) had been infected through vertical transmission.  
The SVR rate was 97% overall (97% [32/33] in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection and 100% 
[1/1] in patients with genotype 4 HCV infection). One patient who prematurely discontinued study 
treatment after five days due to abnormal taste of the medication did not achieve SVR. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir to HCV-infected patients, ledipasvir median 
peak plasma concentration was observed at 4.0 hours post-dose. Sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and 
the median peak plasma concentrations were observed ~ 1 hour post-dose. Median peak plasma 
concentration of GS-331007 was observed at 4 hours post-dose. 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients, geometric mean 
steady-state AUC0-24 for ledipasvir (n = 2,113), sofosbuvir (n = 1,542), and GS-331007 (n = 2,113) 
were 7,290, 1,320 and 12,000 ng•h/mL, respectively.  Steady-state Cmax for ledipasvir, sofosbuvir and 
GS-331007 were 323, 618 and 707 ng/mL, respectively. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0-24 and Cmax 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were similar in healthy adult subjects and patients with HCV infection.  Relative to healthy subjects 
(n = 191), ledipasvir AUC0-24 and Cmax were 24% lower and 32% lower, respectively, in HCV-infected 
patients. Ledipasvir AUC is dose proportional over the dose range of 3 to 100 mg.  Sofosbuvir and 
GS-331007 AUCs are near dose proportional over the dose range of 200 mg to 400 mg. 
Effects of food 
Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with a 
moderate fat or high fat meal increased the sofosbuvir AUC0-inf by approximately 2-fold, but did not 
significantly affect the sofosbuvir Cmax. The exposures to GS-331007 and ledipasvir were not altered 
in the presence of either meal type. Harvoni can be administered without regard to food. 
Distribution 
Ledipasvir is > 99.8% bound to human plasma proteins.  After a single 90 mg dose of [14C]-ledipasvir 
in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity ranged between 0.51 and 0.66. 
Sofosbuvir is approximately 61-65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent 
of drug concentration over the range of 1 µg/mL to 20 µg/mL. Protein binding of GS-331007 was 
minimal in human plasma. After a single 400 mg dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir in healthy subjects, the 
blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity was approximately 0.7. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro, no detectable metabolism of ledipasvir was observed by human CYP1A2, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Evidence of slow oxidative metabolism via an unknown 
mechanism has been observed. Following a single dose of 90 mg [14C]-ledipasvir, systemic exposure 
was almost exclusively due to the parent drug (> 98%). Unchanged ledipasvir is also the major species 
present in faeces. 
Sofosbuvir is extensively metabolised in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside 
analogue triphosphate GS-461203. The active metabolite is not observed. The metabolic activation 
pathway involves sequential hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester moiety catalysed by human cathepsin A 
or carboxylesterase 1 and phosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 
followed by phosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation 
results in the formation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently 
rephosphorylated and lacks anti-HCV activity in vitro. Within ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, GS-331007 
accounts for approximately 85% of total systemic exposure. 
Elimination 
Following a single 90 mg oral dose of [14C]-ledipasvir, mean total recovery of the [14C]-radioactivity 
in faeces and urine was 87%, with most of the radioactive dose recovered from faeces (86%).  
Unchanged ledipasvir excreted in faeces accounted for a mean of 70% of the administered dose and 
the oxidative metabolite M19 accounted for 2.2% of the dose. These data suggest that biliary excretion 
of unchanged ledipasvir is a major route of elimination with renal excretion being a minor pathway 
(approximately 1%). The median terminal half-life of ledipasvir in healthy volunteers following 
administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in the fasted state was 47 hours. 
Following a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the dose was greater 
than 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, faeces, and expired 
air, respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while 
3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir. This data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination 
pathway for GS-331007 with a large part actively secreted. The median terminal half-lives of 
sofosbuvir and GS-331007 following administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir were 0.5 and 27 hours, 
respectively. 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neither ledipasvir nor sofosbuvir are substrates for hepatic uptake transporters, organic cation 
transporter (OCT) 1, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OATP1B3.  GS-331007 
is not a substrate for renal transporters including organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 or OAT3, or 
OCT2. 
In vitro potential for ledipasvir/sofosbuvir to affect other medicinal products 
At concentrations achieved in the clinic, ledipasvir is not an inhibitor of hepatic transporters including 
the OATP 1B1 or 1B3, BSEP, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, multidrug and toxic compound extrusion 
(MATE) 1 transporter, multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 2 or MRP4.  Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 
are not inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1 and 
GS-331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OCT2 and MATE1. 
Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors or inducers of CYP or uridine diphosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzymes. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Race and gender 
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to race have been identified for ledipasvir, 
sofosbuvir or GS-331007. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been 
identified for sofosbuvir or GS-331007. AUC and Cmax of ledipasvir were 77% and 58% higher, 
respectively, in females than males; however, the relationship between gender and ledipasvir 
exposures was not considered clinically relevant. 
Elderly 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients showed that within the age range (18 to 
80 years) analysed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to ledipasvir, 
sofosbuvir or GS-331007. Clinical studies of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir included 235 patients (8.6% of total 
number of patients) aged 65 years and over. 
Renal impairment 
A summary of the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment (RI) on the exposures of the 
components of Harvoni compared to subjects with normal renal function, as described in the text 
below, are provided in Table 21.

The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied in HCV negative adult patients with mild (eGFR 
≥ 50 and < 80 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR ≥ 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe renal 
impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis following 
a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir,relative to patients with normal renal function (eGFR 
> 80 mL/min/1.73 m2). GS-331007 is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction 
coefficient of approximately 53%. Following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, a 4 hour 
haemodialysis removed 18% of administered sofosbuvir dose. 
In HCV-infected adult patients with severe renal impairment treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 
12 weeks (n = 18), the pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were consistent 
with that observed in HCV negative patients with severe renal impairment. 
The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were studied in HCV-infected adult 
patients with ESRD requiring dialysis treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (n=94) for 8, 12, or 24 weeks, 
and compared to patients without renal impairment in the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir Phase 2/3 trials. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg ledipasvir in 
HCV negative adult patients with severe hepatic impairment (CPT class C).  Ledipasvir plasma 
exposure (AUCinf) was similar in patients with severe hepatic impairment and control patients with 
normal hepatic function. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected adult patients 
indicated that cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the 
exposure to ledipasvir. 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in 
HCV-infected adult patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT class B and C).  
Relative to patients with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC0-24 was 126% and 143% higher 
in moderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 18% and 9% higher, 
respectively. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected patients indicated that cirrhosis 
(including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir 
and GS-331007. 
Body weight 
Body weight did not have a significant effect on sofosbuvir exposure according to a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. Exposure to ledipasvir decreases with increasing body weight but the effect 
is not considered to be clinically relevant. 
Paediatric population 
Ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 exposures in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above were 
similar to those in adults from Phase 2/3 studies, following administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. 
The 90% confidence intervals of geometric least-squares mean ratios for all PK parameters of interest 
were contained within the predetermined similarity bounds of less than 2-fold (50% to 200%) with the 
exception of ledipasvir Ctau in paediatric patients 12 years and above which was 84% higher (90%CI: 
168% to 203%) and was not considered clinically relevant.  
The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 have not been established in 
paediatric patients aged < 3 years (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Ledipasvir 
No target organs of toxicity were identified in rat and dog studies with ledipasvir at AUC exposures 
approximately 7 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ledipasvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial 
mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo rat 
micronucleus assays. 
Ledipasvir was not carcinogenic in the 26-week rasH2 transgenic mouse and the 2-year rat 
carcinogenicity studies at exposures up to 26-times in mice and 8-times in rats higher than human 
exposure.  
Ledipasvir had no adverse effects on mating and fertility. In female rats, the mean number of corpora 
lutea and implantation sites were slightly reduced at maternal exposures 6-fold the exposure in humans 
at the recommended clinical dose. At the no observed effect level, AUC exposure to ledipasvir was 
approximately 7- and 3-fold, in males and females, respectively, the human exposure at the 
recommended clinical dose. 
No teratogenic effects were observed in rat and rabbit developmental toxicity studies with ledipasvir. 
In a rat pre- and postnatal study, at a maternally toxic dose, the developing rat offspring exhibited 
mean decreased body weight and body weight gain when exposed in utero (via maternal dosing) and 
during lactation (via maternal milk) at a maternal exposure 4 times the exposure in humans at the 
recommended clinical dose. There were no effects on survival, physical and behavioural development 
and reproductive performance in the offspring at maternal exposures similar to the exposure in humans 
at the recommended clinical dose. 
When administered to lactating rats, ledipasvir was detected in plasma of suckling rats likely due to 
excretion of ledipasvir via milk. 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that ledipasvir has the potential to be very 
persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) in the environment (See section 6.6). 
Sofosbuvir 
In repeat dose toxicology studies in rat and dog, high doses of the 1:1 diastereomeric mixture caused 
adverse liver (dog) and heart (rat) effects and gastrointestinal reactions (dog). Exposure to sofosbuvir 
in rodent studies could not be detected likely due to high esterase activity; however, exposure to the 
major metabolite GS-331007 at doses which cause adverse effects was 16 times (rat) and 71 times 
(dog) higher than the clinical exposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. No liver or heart findings were observed 
in chronic toxicity studies at exposures 5 times (rat) and 16 times (dog) higher than the clinical 
exposure. No liver or heart findings were observed in the 2-year carcinogenicity studies at exposures 
17 times (mouse) and 9 times (rat) higher than the clinical exposure. 
Sofosbuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial 
mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo mouse 
micronucleus assays. 
Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats do not indicate any carcinogenicity potential of sofosbuvir 
administered at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in mouse and 750 mg/kg/day in rat. Exposure to 
GS-331007 in these studies was up to 17 times (mouse) and 9 times (rat) higher than the clinical 
exposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. 
Sofosbuvir had no effects on embryo-foetal viability or on fertility in rat and was not teratogenic in rat 
and rabbit development studies. No adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction or development of 
offspring in rat were reported. In rabbit studies exposure to sofosbuvir was 6 times the expected 
clinical exposure. In the rat studies, exposure to sofosbuvir could not be determined but exposure 
margins based on the major human metabolite was approximately 5 times higher than the clinical 
exposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sofosbuvir-derived material was transferred through the placenta in pregnant rats and into the milk of 
lactating rats.

Contents of the pack and other information 
If Harvoni has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this leaflet 
is applicable to your child (in this case please read “your child” instead of “you”). 
1.  What Harvoni is and what it is used for 
Harvoni is a medicine that contains the active substances ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Harvoni is given 
to treat chronic (long-term) hepatitis C virus infection in adults and children 3 years of age and 
older. 
Hepatitis C is a virus that infects the liver. The active substances in the medicine work together by 
blocking two different proteins that the virus needs to grow and reproduce itself, allowing the infection 
to be permanently eliminated from the body. 
Harvoni is sometimes taken with another medicine, ribavirin. 
It is very important that you also read the leaflets for the other medicines that you will be taking with 
Harvoni. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.

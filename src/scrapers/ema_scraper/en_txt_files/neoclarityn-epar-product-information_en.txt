CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Neoclarityn is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older for the relief of symptoms 
associated with: 
- 
- 
allergic rhinitis (see section 5.1) 
urticaria (see section 5.1) 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and over) 
The recommended dose of Neoclarityn is one tablet once a day. 
Intermittent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or for less than 
4 weeks) should be managed in accordance with the evaluation of patient’s disease history and the 
treatment could be discontinued after symptoms are resolved and reinitiated upon their reappearance. 
In persistent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 
4 weeks), continued treatment may be proposed to the patients during the allergen exposure periods. 
Paediatric population 
There is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with the use of desloratadine in adolescents 
12 through 17 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
The safety and efficacy of Neoclarityn 5 mg film-coated tablets in children below the age of 12 years 
have not been established. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
The dose can be taken with or without food.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to loratadine.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Renal function impairment  
In the case of severe renal insufficiency, Neoclarityn should be used with caution (see section 5.2).  
Seizures 
Desloratadine should be administered with caution in patients with medical or familial history of 
seizures, and mainly young children (see section 4.8), being more susceptible to develop new seizures 
under desloratadine treatment. Healthcare providers may consider discontinuing desloratadine in 
patients who experience a seizure while on treatment. 
Neoclarityn tablet contains lactose 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the total lactase deficiency or glucose-
galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No clinically relevant interactions were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets in which 
erythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
In a clinical pharmacology trial, Neoclarityn tablets taken concomitantly with alcohol did not 
potentiate the performance impairing effects of alcohol (see section 5.1). However, cases of alcohol 
intolerance and intoxication have been reported during post-marketing use. Therefore, caution is 
recommended if alcohol is taken concomitantly. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no 
malformative nor foeto/ neonatal toxicity of desloratadine. Animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Neoclarityn during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
Desloratadine has been identified in breastfed newborns/infants of treated women. The effect of 
desloratadine on newborns/infants is unknown. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Neoclarityn therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data available on male and female fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Neoclarityn has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines based on clinical trials. 
Patients should be informed that most people do not experience drowsiness. Nevertheless, as there is 
individual variation in response to all medicinal products, it is recommended that patients are advised 
not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or using machines, until 
they have established their own response to the medicinal product.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials in a range of indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at 
the recommended dose of 5 mg daily, undesirable effects with Neoclarityn were reported in 3 % of 
patients in excess of those treated with placebo. The most frequent of adverse reactions reported in 
excess of placebo were fatigue (1.2 %), dry mouth (0.8 %) and headache (0.6 %).  
Paediatric population 
In a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients, 12 through 17 years of age, the most common adverse 
event was headache; this occurred in 5.9 % of patients treated with desloratadine and 6.9 % of patients 
receiving placebo. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The frequency of the clinical trial adverse reactions reported in excess of placebo and other 
undesirable effects reported during the post-marketing period are listed in the following table. 
Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 
to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated 
from the available data).

desloratadine. Among children 0-4 years old, the adjusted absolute increase was 37.5 (95 % 
Confidence Interval (CI) 10.5-64.5) per 100,000 person years (PY) with a background rate of new 
onset seizure of 80.3 per 100,000 PY. Among patients 5-19 years of age, the adjusted absolute 
increase was 11.3 (95 % CI 2.3-20.2) per 100,000 PY with a background rate of 36.4 per 100,000 PY. 
(See section 4.4.) 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to 
that seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher. 
Treatment 
In the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove unabsorbed active substance. 
Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. 
Desloratadine is not eliminated by haemodialysis; it is not known if it is eliminated by peritoneal 
dialysis. 
Symptoms 
Based on a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadine was administered 
(nine times the clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed. 
Paediatric population 
The adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to 
that seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihistamines – H1 antagonist, ATC code: R06AX27  
Mechanism of action 
Desloratadine is a non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-receptor 
antagonist activity. After oral administration, desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral histamine 
H1-receptors because the substance is excluded from entry to the central nervous system. 
Desloratadine has demonstrated antiallergic properties from in vitro studies. These include inhibiting 
the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mast 
cells/basophils, as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on 
endothelial cells. The clinical relevance of these observations remains to be confirmed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 20 mg of desloratadine was administered daily for 
14 days, no statistically or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was observed. In a clinical 
pharmacology trial, in which desloratadine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the 
clinical dose) for ten days, no prolongation of QTc interval was seen. 
No clinically relevant changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in multiple-dose 
ketoconazole and erythromycin interaction trials. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Desloratadine does not readily penetrate the central nervous system. In controlled clinical trials, at the 
recommended dose of 5 mg daily, there was no excess incidence of somnolence as compared to 
placebo. Neoclarityn given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg did not affect psychomotor performance in 
clinical trials. In a single dose study performed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not affect standard 
measures of flight performance including exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to 
flying. 
In clinical pharmacology trials, co-administration with alcohol did not increase the alcohol-induced 
impairment in performance or increase in sleepiness. No significant differences were found in the 
psychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered alone or 
with alcohol.  
In patients with allergic rhinitis, Neoclarityn was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, 
nasal discharge and itching, as well as ocular itching, tearing and redness, and itching of palate. 
Neoclarityn effectively controlled symptoms for 24 hours. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy of Neoclarityn tablets has not been clearly demonstrated in trials with adolescent patients 
12 through 17 years of age. 
In addition to the established classifications of seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can 
alternatively be classified as intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis according to 
the duration of symptoms. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of symptoms for less 
than 4 days per week or for less than 4 weeks. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of 
symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 4 weeks. 
Neoclarityn was effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by the total 
score of the rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire. The greatest amelioration was seen in the 
domains of practical problems and daily activities limited by symptoms.  
Chronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a clinical model for urticarial conditions, since the 
underlying pathophysiology is similar, regardless of etiology, and because chronic patients can be 
more easily recruited prospectively. Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, 
desloratadine is expected to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial conditions, 
in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, as advised in clinical guidelines. 
In two placebo-controlled six week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Neoclarityn was 
effective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the first 
dosing interval. In each trial, the effects were sustained over the 24 hour dosing interval. As with other 
antihistamine trials in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who were identified as 
non-responsive to antihistamines was excluded. An improvement in pruritus of more than 50 % was 
observed in 55 % of patients treated with desloratadine compared with 19 % of patients treated with 
placebo. Treatment with Neoclarityn also significantly reduced interference with sleep and daytime 
function, as measured by a four-point scale used to assess these variables. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Desloratadine plasma concentrations can be detected within 30 minutes of administration. 
Desloratadine is well absorbed with maximum concentration achieved after approximately 3 hours; the 
terminal phase half-life is approximately 27 hours. The degree of accumulation of desloratadine was 
consistent with its half-life (approximately 27 hours) and a once daily dosing frequency. The 
bioavailability of desloratadine was dose proportional over the range of 5 mg to 20 mg.  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a pharmacokinetic trial in which patient demographics were comparable to those of the general 
seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4 % of the subjects achieved a higher concentration of 
desloratadine. This percentage may vary according to ethnic background. Maximum desloratadine 
concentration was about 3-fold higher at approximately 7 hours with a terminal phase half-life of 
approximately 89 hours. The safety profile of these subjects was not different from that of the general 
population. 
Distribution 
Desloratadine is moderately bound (83 % - 87 %) to plasma proteins. There is no evidence of 
clinically relevant medicine accumulation following once daily dosing of desloratadine (5 mg to 
20 mg) for 14 days.  
Biotransformation 
The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and therefore, 
some interactions with other medicinal products cannot be fully excluded. Desloratadine does not 
inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit 
CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. 
Elimination 
In a single dose trial using a 7.5 mg dose of desloratadine, there was no effect of food (high-fat, high 
caloric breakfast) on the disposition of desloratadine. In another study, grapefruit juice had no effect 
on the disposition of desloratadine. 
Renally impaired patients  
The pharmacokinetics of desloratadine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) was 
compared with that of healthy subjects in one single-dose study and one multiple dose study. In the 
single-dose study, the exposure to desloratadine was approximately 2 and 2.5-fold greater in subjects 
with mild to moderate and severe CRI, respectively, than in healthy subjects. In the multiple-dose 
study, steady state was reached after Day 11, and compared to healthy subjects the exposure to 
desloratadine was ~1.5-fold greater in subjects with mild to moderate CRI and ~2.5-fold greater in 
subjects with severe CRI. In both studies, changes in exposure (AUC and Cmax) of desloratadine and 
3-hydroxydesloratadine were not clinically relevant.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Desloratadine is the primary active metabolite of loratadine. Non-clinical studies conducted with 
desloratadine and loratadine demonstrated that there are no qualitative or quantitative differences in 
the toxicity profile of desloratadine and loratadine at comparable levels of exposure to desloratadine. 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development. The lack of carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in studies conducted with 
desloratadine and loratadine.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Neoclarityn is indicated in adults, adolescents and children over the age of 1 year for the relief of 
symptoms associated with: 
- 
- 
allergic rhinitis (see section 5.1) 
urticaria (see section 5.1) 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and over) 
The recommended dose of Neoclarityn is 10 ml (5 mg) oral solution once a day. 
Paediatric population 
The prescriber should be aware that most cases of rhinitis below 2 years of age are of infectious origin 
(see section 4.4) and there are no data supporting the treatment of infectious rhinitis with Neoclarityn. 
Children 1 through 5 years of age: 2.5 ml (1.25 mg) Neoclarityn oral solution once a day.  
Children 6 through 11 years of age: 5 ml (2.5 mg) Neoclarityn oral solution once a day.  
The safety and efficacy of Neoclarityn 0.5 mg/ml oral solution in children below the age of 1 year 
have not been established.  
There is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with the use of desloratadine in children 1 through 
11 years of age and adolescents 12 through 17 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Intermittent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or for less than 
4 weeks) should be managed in accordance with the evaluation of patient’s disease history and the 
treatment could be discontinued after symptoms are resolved and reinitiated upon their reappearance.  
In persistent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 
4 weeks), continued treatment may be proposed to the patients during the allergen exposure periods.

Method of administration 
Oral use. 
The dose can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to loratadine.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Renal function impairment  
In the case of severe renal insufficiency, Neoclarityn should be used with caution (see section 5.2).  
Seizures 
Desloratadine should be administered with caution in patients with medical or familial history of 
seizures, and mainly young children (see section 4.8), being more susceptible to develop new seizures 
under desloratadine treatment. Healthcare providers may consider discontinuing desloratadine in 
patients who experience a seizure while on treatment. 
Neoclarityn oral solution contains sorbitol (E420) 
This medicinal product contains 150 mg sorbitol (E420) in each ml of oral solution.  
The additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (E420) (or fructose) 
and dietary intake of sorbitol (E420) (or fructose) should be taken into account. The content of sorbitol 
(E420) in medicinal products for oral use may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products for 
oral use administered concomitantly. 
 Sorbitol is a source of fructose; patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take this 
medicinal product. 
Neoclarityn oral solution contains propylene glycol (E1520) 
This medicinal product contains 100.75 mg propylene glycol (E1520) in each ml of oral solution.  
Neoclarityn oral solution contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Neoclarityn oral solution contains benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains 0.75 mg benzyl alcohol in each ml of oral solution.  
Benzyl alcohol may cause anaphylactoid reactions. 
Increased risk due to accumulation in young children. It is not recommended to be used for more than 
a week in young children (less than 3 years old). 
High volumes should be used with caution and only if necessary, especially in subjects with liver or 
kidney impairment because of the risk of accumulation and toxicity (metabolic acidosis).  
Paediatric population 
In children below 2 years of age, the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is particularly difficult to distinguish 
from other forms of rhinitis. The absence of upper respiratory tract infection or structural 
abnormalities, as well as patient history, physical examinations, and appropriate laboratory and skin 
tests should be considered. 
Approximately 6 % of adults and children 2- to 11-year old are phenotypic poor metabolisers of 
desloratadine and exhibit a higher exposure (see section 5.2). The safety of desloratadine in children 2- 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to 11-years of age who are poor metabolisers is the same as in children who are normal metabolisers. 
The effects of desloratadine in poor metabolisers < 2 years of age have not been studied. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No clinically relevant interactions were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets in which 
erythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered (see section 5.1).  
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
In a clinical pharmacology trial, Neoclarityn tablets taken concomitantly with alcohol did not 
potentiate the performance impairing effects of alcohol (see section 5.1). However, cases of alcohol 
intolerance and intoxication have been reported during post-marketing use. Therefore, caution is 
recommended if alcohol is taken concomitantly.

Pregnancy 
A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no 
malformative nor foeto/ neonatal toxicity of desloratadine. Animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Neoclarityn during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Desloratadine has been identified in breastfed newborns/infants of treated women. The effect of 
desloratadine on newborns/infants is unknown. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Neoclarityn therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data available on male and female fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Neoclarityn has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines based on clinical trials. 
Patients should be informed that most people do not experience drowsiness. Nevertheless, as there is 
individual variation in response to all medicinal products, it is recommended that patients are advised 
not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or using machines, until 
they have established their own response to the medicinal product. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Paediatric population 
In clinical trials in a paediatric population, the desloratadine syrup formulation was administered to a 
total of 246 children aged 6 months through 11 years. The overall incidence of adverse events in 
children 2 through 11 years of age was similar for the desloratadine and the placebo groups. In infants 
and toddlers aged 6 to 23 months, the most frequent adverse reactions reported in excess of placebo 
were diarrhoea (3.7 %), fever (2.3 %) and insomnia (2.3 %). In an additional study, no adverse events 
were seen in subjects between 6 and 11 years of age following a single 2.5 mg dose of desloratadine 
oral solution. 
In a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients, 12 through 17 years of age, the most common adverse 
event was headache; this occurred in 5.9 % of patients treated with desloratadine and 6.9 % of patients 
receiving placebo.

Adults and adolescents 
At the recommended dose, in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in a range of indications 
including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, undesirable effects with Neoclarityn were 
reported in 3 % of patients in excess of those treated with placebo. The most frequent of adverse 
events reported in excess of placebo were fatigue (1.2 %), dry mouth (0.8 %) and headache (0.6 %).

desloratadine. Among children 0-4 years old, the adjusted absolute increase was 37.5 (95 % 
Confidence Interval (CI) 10.5-64.5) per 100,000 person years (PY) with a background rate of new 
onset seizure of 80.3 per 100,000 PY. Among patients 5-19 years of age, the adjusted absolute 
increase was 11.3 (95 % CI 2.3-20.2) per 100,000 PY with a background rate of 36.4 per 100,000 PY. 
(See section 4.4.) 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to 
that seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher. 
Treatment 
In the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove unabsorbed active substance. 
Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. 
Desloratadine is not eliminated by haemodialysis; it is not known if it is eliminated by peritoneal 
dialysis. 
Symptoms 
Based on a multiple dose clinical trial in adults and adolescents, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadine 
was administered (nine times the clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed. 
Paediatric population 
The adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to 
that seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihistamines – H1 antagonist, ATC code: R06AX27  
Mechanism of action 
Desloratadine is a non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-receptor 
antagonist activity. After oral administration, desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral histamine 
H1-receptors because the substance is excluded from entry to the central nervous system. 
Desloratadine has demonstrated antiallergic properties from in vitro studies. These include inhibiting 
the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mast 
cells/basophils, as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on 
endothelial cells. The clinical relevance of these observations remains to be confirmed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Paediatric population 
Efficacy of Neoclarityn oral solution has not been investigated in separate paediatric trials. However, 
the safety of desloratadine syrup formulation, which contains the same concentration of desloratadine 
as Neoclarityn oral solution, was demonstrated in three paediatric trials. Children, 1-11 years of age, 
who were candidates for antihistamine therapy received a daily desloratadine dose of 1.25 mg 
(1 through 5 years of age) or 2.5 mg (6 through 11 years of age). Treatment was well tolerated as 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
documented by clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG interval data, including QTc. When 
given at the recommended doses, the plasma concentrations of desloratadine (see section 5.2) were 
comparable in the paediatric and adult populations. Thus, since the course of allergic rhinitis/chronic 
idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadine are similar in adults and paediatric patients, 
desloratadine efficacy data in adults can be extrapolated to the paediatric population. 
Efficacy of Neoclarityn syrup has not been investigated in paediatric trials in children less than 
12 years of age. 
Adults and adolescents 
In a multiple dose clinical trial, in adults and adolescents, in which up to 20 mg of desloratadine was 
administered daily for 14 days, no statistically or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was 
observed. In a clinical pharmacology trial, in adults and adolescents, in which desloratadine was 
administered to adults at a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) for ten days, no 
prolongation of QTc interval was seen. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Desloratadine does not readily penetrate the central nervous system. In controlled clinical trials, at the 
recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, there was no excess incidence of 
somnolence as compared to placebo. Neoclarityn tablets given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg to 
adults and adolescents did not affect psychomotor performance in clinical trials. In a single dose study 
performed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not affect standard measures of flight performance 
including exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to flying. 
In clinical pharmacology trials in adults, co-administration with alcohol did not increase the 
alcohol-induced impairment in performance or increase in sleepiness. No significant differences were 
found in the psychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered 
alone or with alcohol.  
No clinically relevant changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in multiple-dose 
ketoconazole and erythromycin interaction trials. 
In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Neoclarityn tablets were effective in relieving 
symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge and itching, as well as ocular itching, tearing and redness, 
and itching of palate. Neoclarityn effectively controlled symptoms for 24 hours. The efficacy of 
Neoclarityn tablets has not been clearly demonstrated in trials with adolescent patients 12 through 
17 years of age. 
In addition to the established classifications of seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can 
alternatively be classified as intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis according to 
the duration of symptoms. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of symptoms for less 
than 4 days per week or for less than 4 weeks. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of 
symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 4 weeks. 
Neoclarityn tablets were effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by 
the total score of the rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire. The greatest amelioration was 
seen in the domains of practical problems and daily activities limited by symptoms. 
Chronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a clinical model for urticarial conditions, since the 
underlying pathophysiology is similar, regardless of etiology, and because chronic patients can be 
more easily recruited prospectively. Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, 
desloratadine is expected to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial conditions, 
in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, as advised in clinical guidelines. 
In two placebo-controlled six week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Neoclarityn was 
effective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the first 
dosing interval. In each trial, the effects were sustained over the 24 hour dosing interval. As with other 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antihistamine trials in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who were identified as 
non-responsive to antihistamines was excluded. An improvement in pruritus of more than 50 % was 
observed in 55 % of patients treated with desloratadine compared with 19 % of patients treated with 
placebo. Treatment with Neoclarityn also significantly reduced interference with sleep and daytime 
function, as measured by a four-point scale used to assess these variables. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Desloratadine plasma concentrations can be detected within 30 minutes of desloratadine 
administration in adults and adolescents. Desloratadine is well absorbed with maximum concentration 
achieved after approximately 3 hours; the terminal phase half-life is approximately 27 hours. The 
degree of accumulation of desloratadine was consistent with its half-life (approximately 27 hours) and 
a once daily dosing frequency. The bioavailability of desloratadine was dose proportional over the 
range of 5 mg to 20 mg.  
In a series of pharmacokinetic and clinical trials, 6 % of the subjects reached a higher concentration of 
desloratadine. The prevalence of this poor metaboliser phenotype was comparable for adult (6 %) and 
paediatric subjects 2- to 11-year old (6 %), and greater among Blacks (18 % adult, 16 % paediatric) 
than Caucasians (2 % adult, 3 % paediatric) in both populations. 
In a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study conducted with the tablet formulation in healthy adult 
subjects, four subjects were found to be poor metabolisers of desloratadine. These subjects had a Cmax 
concentration about 3-fold higher at approximately 7 hours with a terminal phase half-life of 
approximately 89 hours. 
Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study 
conducted with the syrup formulation in paediatric poor metaboliser subjects 2- to 11-year old 
diagnosed with allergic rhinitis. The exposure (AUC) to desloratadine was about 6-fold higher and the 
Cmax was about 3 to 4 fold higher at 3-6 hours with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours. 
Exposure was the same in adult and paediatric poor metabolisers when treated with age-appropriate 
doses. The overall safety profile of these subjects was not different from that of the general population. 
The effects of desloratadine in poor metabolizers < 2 years of age have not been studied. 
In separate single dose studies, at the recommended doses, paediatric patients had comparable AUC 
and Cmax values of desloratadine to those in adults who received a 5 mg dose of desloratadine syrup. 
Distribution 
Desloratadine is moderately bound (83 % - 87 %) to plasma proteins. There is no evidence of 
clinically relevant active substance accumulation following once daily adult and adolescent dosing of 
desloratadine (5 mg to 20 mg) for 14 days.  
In a single dose, crossover study of desloratadine, the tablet and the syrup formulations were found to 
be bioequivalent. As Neoclarityn oral solution contains the same concentration of desloratadine, no 
bioequivalence study was required and it is expected to be equivalent to the syrup and tablet. 
Biotransformation 
The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and therefore, 
some interactions with other medicinal products cannot be fully excluded. Desloratadine does not 
inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit 
CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. 
Elimination 
In a single dose trial using a 7.5 mg dose of desloratadine, there was no effect of food (high-fat, high 
caloric breakfast) on the disposition of desloratadine. In another study, grapefruit juice had no effect 
on the disposition of desloratadine. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renally impaired patients  
The pharmacokinetics of desloratadine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) was 
compared with that of healthy subjects in one single-dose study and one multiple dose study. In the 
single-dose study, the exposure to desloratadine was approximately 2 and 2.5-fold greater in subjects 
with mild to moderate and severe CRI, respectively, than in healthy subjects. In the multiple-dose 
study, steady state was reached after Day 11, and compared to healthy subjects the exposure to 
desloratadine was ~1.5-fold greater in subjects with mild to moderate CRI and ~2.5-fold greater in 
subjects with severe CRI. In both studies, changes in exposure (AUC and Cmax) of desloratadine and 
3-hydroxydesloratadine were not clinically relevant.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Desloratadine is the primary active metabolite of loratadine. Non-clinical studies conducted with 
desloratadine and loratadine demonstrated that there are no qualitative or quantitative differences in 
the toxicity profile of desloratadine and loratadine at comparable levels of exposure to desloratadine.  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development. The lack of carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in studies conducted with 
desloratadine and loratadine.

1.  What Neoclarityn is and what it is used for 
What Neoclarityn is 
Neoclarityn contains desloratadine which is an antihistamine. 
How Neoclarityn works 
Neoclarityn is an antiallergy medicine that does not make you drowsy. It helps control your allergic 
reaction and its symptoms. 
When Neoclarityn should be used

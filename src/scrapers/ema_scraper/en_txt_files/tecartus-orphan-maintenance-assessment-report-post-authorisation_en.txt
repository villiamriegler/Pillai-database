2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion 
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2020 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
“Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the 
following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing autologous peripheral 
blood T cells CD4 and CD8 selected and CD3 and CD28 activated transduced with retroviral vector 
expressing anti-CD19 CD28/CD3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor and cultured was considered 
justified based on clinical data in heavily pre-treated patients showing high rate of durable 
responses; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening depending on the response to 
treatment, with acute leukaemic forms being fatal in a few weeks if left untreated. Symptoms 
include persistent fever, infections, anaemia, fatigue, breathlessness, bone and joint pain. The 
invasion of the bloodstream, the bone marrow and/or the lymphatic system result in lack of normal 
blood cells, bone marrow failure, and organ damage; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 1.4 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, 
the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing autologous peripheral blood T cells CD4 and CD8 selected and CD3 and CD28 activated 
transduced with retroviral vector expressing anti-CD19 CD28/CD3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor and 
cultured will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has provided 
clinical data that demonstrate that patients who were relapsed/refractory to the standard of care 
achieved a high rate of complete and durable responses. This compared favourably to all products 
authorised in the condition. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage”. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoid disorders resulting from 
clonal proliferation of immature B-cell (75-80%) or T-cell (20-25%) lineages (lymphoblasts or blast 
cells) in the blood, bone marrow, and other lymphatic- (e.g., lymph nodes and spleen) and non-
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000063560 
Page 4/15 
 
 
 
 
 
lymphatic organs (e.g., central nervous system [CNS], liver, and bones). The leukemic blast cells 
displace normal healthy blood cells, and white blood cells and/or precursors of these in the bone 
marrow. Low blood cell counts of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets can subsequently 
cause infections, anaemia, and bleeding. 
ALL occurs in a bimodal age distribution, with approximately 60% of diagnosed cases occurring in 
patients less than 20 years old and over 25% of diagnosed cases occurring in adult patients over 45 
years old (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2020). The condition can be classified in 3 
subtypes, explicitly B-cell precursor ALL, mature B
cell ALL, and T
cell ALL. B-precursor ALL represents 
the most common form of ALL in adult patients characterized by infiltration of bone marrow and 
‑
peripheral blood by small to medium-sized blast cells typically positive for the B-cell markers such as 
‑
CD19, CD79a, and CD22. Moreover, 25% of adult patients with ALL have Philadelphia chromosome 
positive (Ph+) disease, a status which confers a very poor prognosis to the patients (Pullarkat et al., 
2008). 
ALL is the most common childhood malignancy. It represents 75% of childhood leukaemias and 
approximately 30% of all childhood cancers {Hoffman 2014, Rizzari 2014}. 
The approved extension of the therapeutic indication “Tecartus is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients 26 years of age and above with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL)” falls entirely within the scope of the designated orphan condition “treatment of acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat 
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CAT/CHMP, 
see EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There has been no change to the chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature of the condition 
since the orphan designation in 2020. 
Clinically, ALL may present as asymptomatic or acute with life-threatening haemorrhage, infection, or 
episodes of respiratory distress. The most common ALL symptoms reported are often related to bone 
marrow failure and include fatigue, intolerance of physical activities due to anaemia, easy bruising, and 
excess bleeding, caused by onset of thrombocytopenia. Other notable symptoms include persistent 
fever, infections, bone and joint pain, night sweats and weight loss. The invasion of the tumour cells in 
the bloodstream, the bone marrow, and/or the lymphatic system result in lack of normal blood cells, 
bone marrow failure, and specific organ damage. In addition, acute leukaemic forms are being fatal in 
a few weeks if left untreated. 
In paediatric population, for the 20% of patients who relapse after an initial response, re-induction can 
yield remission in 65% to 85% of patients; however, long-term survival rates are significantly lower 
(40% to 50%) in relapsed patients than in non-relapsed patients (5-year overall survival [OS] of 90%) 
(Malard 2020). Outcomes are also worse in patients who are primary refractory, relapse after first 
salvage and beyond setting or relapsed or refractory (r/r) after SCT (Gaynon 1998, Hoffman 2014, 
Malempati 2007, Nguyen 2008). 
Although ALL is less common in adults, both the prognosis and outcome are worse in adults when 
compared to children. While initial complete remission (CR) rates in adults are high (80-90%) and 
median duration of first remission in most studies is 18 months or more, most patients eventually 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000063560 
Page 5/15 
 
 
 
 
 
relapse. For example, in patients treated with chemotherapy, CR rates were approximately 20% to 
40% lower in patients who relapsed within 12 months of an initial response and OS was approximately 
6 months with a median survival time ranging from 2 to 8 months {Fielding 2007, Gokbuget 2012, 
Kantarjian 2010, O'Brien 2008, Oriol 2010, Tavernier 2007}. 
The condition can be considered both chronically debilitating and life threatening. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation, the prevalence figure accepted led to the conclusion that ALL was affecting 
less than 1.4 in 10,000 people in the EU. The sponsor does not discuss this but seem to use a different 
methodology and possible some different references and suggest a 1-year prevalence of 3.46 per 
10,000 based on data from the Global Burden of Disease database (GBD; EU28; 2019 data). It is not 
clear why a 1-year prevalence has been used as in general the disease duration is longer, and in the 
orphan designation a 5-year duration was used. The sponsor seems also to have used data from all of 
Europe while only data for the EU27 plus the EEA countries are to be used for the prevalence estimate. 
Furthermore, there is no explanation of the GBD, what sources it uses, and the methodology used to 
come to this conclusion. Neither does the sponsor provide a discussion on the outcome of the claimed 
literature search. 
It is not agreed with the sponsor that there is a paucity in data sources reporting the incidence or 
prevalence in the EU. GLOBOCAB, NORDCAN, and ECIS are all relevant sources and there are several 
national cancer registries. In case a prevalence figure cannot be found, the prevalence can be 
calculated by using the incidence times duration (I*D) as suggested in the 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/points-consider-
estimation-reporting-prevalence-condition-orphan-designation_en.pdf 
Although it is acknowledged that ALL affects less than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU, the sponsor should 
recalculate the prevalence estimate based on more relevant and comprehensive data sources on ALL, 
including ECIS for indirect estimation. The sponsor should specifically describe the methods used for 
the estimation and present the different sources used for the reported calculations in a tabular format. 
Improvements in survival due to current treatment options for ALL and better treatment outcomes 
should be considered and updated European survival data should be used for the estimate. In addition, 
sensitivity analyses of the reported calculations should be performed to reflect the variability and 
uncertainties from the different sources used. 
The sponsor provided an updated prevalence calculation based on a direct method and an indirect 
approach, the latter which uses the standard formula of Prevalence = Incidence x Duration of disease, 
as a response to a list of question from the COMP. 
For the direct method, a review of published literature and relevant online databases was conducted to 
search for 5-year or higher ALL prevalence estimates from studies published during January 1, 2012, 
through June 6, 2022. Only studies examining individuals residing in EU countries were considered. 
The reported ALL prevalence estimates ranged from 0.11 to 0.66 per 10,000 for a 5-year prevalence 
and 0.76 to 1.12 per 10,000 for a 10-year prevalence (Table 3, from sponsors answers to the list of 
questions). 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000063560 
Page 6/15 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1.  Sources of data for direct prevalence estimates of ALL 
For the indirect estimate, the sponsor used data from the European Cancer Information System (ECIS) 
to calculate the incidence. The 2020 crude incidence of leukaemia in the 27 EU member states (EU27) 
was reported to be 1.49 per 10,000 persons (ECIS, 2022). In the initial maintenance report, the 
sponsor estimated that 15% of leukaemia cases in adults are ALL as reported by Bassan and 
colleagues (Bassan et al., 2004). The sponsor conducted upon request a more recent literature search 
of epidemiology data on ALL and identified a study published by Dong and colleagues (Dong et al., 
2020) which reported that ALL comprises 21.3% of all leukaemia cases in Western Europe, 25.7% of 
leukaemia cases in Eastern Europe, and 23.8% of leukaemia cases in Central Europe based on data 
from 2017. Since the percentage of ALL among all leukaemia cases reported in the literature varied, 
the sponsor calculated a range of ALL incidence estimates based on the lowest (15%) and highest 
(25.7%) reported values. The estimated incidence of ALL, which was calculated using Incidence of 
leukaemia multiplied by Proportion of leukaemia presented as ALL, thus ranged from 0.224 (1.49 x 
15%) to 0.383 (1.49 x 25.7%) per 10,000 persons in the EU. 
Concerning the estimate for the disease duration of the condition, the sponsor reviewed real-world 
studies from the literature, which revealed that the 5-year OS for adult patients diagnosed with ALL 
ranges from 32%-43.4% (Maheswaran and Morley, 2018; Lennmyr et al., 2019). Since the data found 
on OS was considered limited by the sponsor, studies examining relative survival were also included. 
Still, disease duration based on relative survival was regarded as more conservative as it represents 
cancer survival in the absence of other causes of deaths. According to the sponsor, all 5-year survival 
rates reported in the literature were found to be less than 50%. The median survival for patients 
diagnosed with ALL was therefore anticipated by the sponsor to be less than 5 years.

Using the formula P=I*D, and both the low and high estimates for the ALL incidence, the updated 
prevalence of ALL was estimated to span between 1.12 per 10,000 (0.224 x 5 years) and 1.92 per 
10,000 (0.383 x 5 years) persons in the European community. 
The upper range of the revised estimate of 1.9 in 10,000 persons could be accepted for this 
maintenance procedure and is also in line with the 10-year prevalence from NORDCAN and prevalence 
figures recently considered by the COMP. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor provided a detailed description of both EU and nationally approved therapies used for 
treatment of adult patients with ALL. Targeted therapies that have been approved more recently 
include tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah), blinatumomab (Blincyto), and inotuzumab (Besponsa). Other 
medicinal products authorized in the community for the treatment of ALL are cyclophosphamide 
(Sendoxan), cytarabine (generics), fludarabine, clofarabine (Evoltra and generics), daunorubicin 
(Cerubidine), doxorubicin (generics), idarubicin (Zavedos and generics), asparaginase (Spectrila), 
pegaspargase (Oncaspar), crisantaspase (Erwinase), melphalan (Phelinun), mercaptopurine (Xaluprine 
and generics), methotrexate (Jylamvo and generics), nelarabine (Atriance), liposomal vincristine 
sulphate, imatinib (Glivec and generics), dasatinib (Sprycel), and ponatinib (Iclusig). 
Several of the anti-neoplastic agents used for treatment of ALL are given in varying doses and 
schedules, based on patient tolerability and regional preferences, that can be separated in four distinct 
phases after initial diagnosis: induction (1–2 months), consolidation (6–8 months), late intensification 
(re-induction) and long-term maintenance (i.e., 2.5–3 years is optimal and usually recommended) 
(Figure 1).

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains the standard consolidation treatment for adults 
and high-risk patients, in particular Ph+ ALL patients who are biologically fit and have an according 
donor. The continuous improvement in supportive care has significantly reduced transplant-related 
mortality {Malard et al., 2014}. In addition, the outcome of Ph+ ALL patients have significantly 
improved with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). 
The sponsor is specifically targeting an adult population and refer to the ESMO treatment guidelines for 
adults with ALL {Hoelzer et al., 2016}. Age and frailty are both considered during customization of 
treatment regimens. For young adult ALL patients (≤ 35 to 40 years), increased drug intensity is 
recommended, without SCT. For the older adult ALL patients (> 35 to 40, but ≤ 55 to 60 years), doses 
similar to younger patients are recommended, but with an increased role of allo-SCT. Elderly ALL 
patients (> 55 to 60 years), on the other hand, receive less intensive therapy to reduce early 
treatment-related death. This is often accomplished by avoiding anthracyclines and alkylating agents. 
Lastly, frail patients (> 70 to 75 years), typically not considered candidates for major intensive 
therapy, may also potentially benefit from less intensive therapies. 
The indication extension of Tecartus is intended to include treatment of adult patients with r/r B-cell 
precursor ALL. A table overview with a list of medicinal products authorised in the EU for the treatment 
of adult patients with r/r B-precursor ALL and whether they are considered relevant for a discussion on 
the significant benefit of brexucabtagene autoleucel (hereinafter referred to as brexu-cel; Tecartus) in 
ALL is presented below.

and for whom subsequent treatment

or who have the T315I mutation. 
For the purpose of the orphan regulation, a satisfactory method has to overlap completely with the 
target patient population for Tecartus. This means that TKIs will have been used before treatment with 
Tecartus, they are also only indicated for Ph+ ALL and there is no such restriction for Tecartus. 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin has an indication for a similar patient population, however, according to the 
SmPC section 4.1 of this product it is states that “When considering the use of BESPONSA as a 
treatment for relapsed or refractory B cell ALL, baseline CD22 positivity of > 0% using a validated and 
sensitive assay is required prior to initiating treatment (see section 5.1).” However, as all patients with 
B-cell precursor ALL are expected to be CD22 positive (ZM van Zelm et al., 2005), this specification 
does not preclude the target patient population for Tecartus to be treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin. 
Tisagenlecleucel is indicated for children and young adults up to and including 25 years of age which is 
a different target population as compared to that for Tecartus which will be used only in adults over 25 
years of age with ALL. 
The conclusion is that blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin can be considered as satisfactory 
methods for the treatment of the same patient population as Tecartus. 
Significant benefit 
The clinical development programme for the indication expansion of brexu-cel to include treatment of 
adult patients with r/r ALL is based on data from an ongoing, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, 
phase 1/2 study called ZUMA-3. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of brexu-cel 
in adult patients with r/r B-precursor ALL with morphological disease in the bone marrow (>5% blast 
cells). Patients with Ph+ disease were eligible if they were intolerant to TKI therapy or if they had r/r 
disease despite treatment with at least two different TKIs. 
The pivotal part of the study is the phase 2 portion, where all patients (n=55) have been treated with 
the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), a single intravenous infusion of brexu-cel, after completion of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy for ALL. The primary endpoint for the phase 2 part is the overall 
complete remission (OCR) rate, defined as the proportion of patients treated with brexu-cel who 
achieved either a CR or a CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) as per an independent review 
committee (IRC). Secondary efficacy endpoints included minimal residual disease (MRD) status, 
duration of remission (DOR), relapse-free survival (RFS), and OS.

Efficacy and safety data from the adult ALL population from the phase 1 portion of ZUMA-3 was 
submitted as part of the initial application for orphan designation for KTE-X19 for treatment of ALL and 
formed the basis of the designation. For the maintenance report, data from the pivotal phase 2 portion 
of ZUMA-3, up to the data cut-off (DCO) of 9 Sep 2020, is provided to support significant benefit. 
The arguments on significant benefit are based on an improved efficacy of brexu-cel over approved 
therapies for adult patients with r/r B-precursor ALL. The sponsor provides a comparative discussion on 
the key efficacy results from the pivotal phase 2 portion of ZUMA-3 (DCO: 09-Sep-2020and the pivotal 
studies for blinatumomab (TOWER) and inotuzumab (INO-VATE) as summarized below.

The median number of prior lines of therapy in the phase 2 portion of ZUMA-3 was 2 (range: 1-8) and 
almost half of the patients (47%; 26/55) had received at least 3 prior therapies. Among the patients 
who received brexu-cel, 55% (30/55) were naïve to blinatumomab therapy and 78% (43/55) were 
naïve to inotuzumab therapy, while 42% (23/55) had previously received an allo-SCT. Most patients 
(78%; 43/55) had r/r disease after 2 or more lines of therapy, 33% (18/55) had primary refractory 
disease, and 29% (16/55) experienced a first relapse to their first CR ≤ 12 months. In addition, 27% 
(15/55) of the patients in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT; all infused) population were Ph+. 
Comparative discussion of brexu-cel versus blinatumomab 
The bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager blinatumomab (Blincyto) was granted approval in the 
EU as monotherapy, for the treatment of adults with Ph- CD19+ r/r B-precursor ALL, in first or second 
CR. Full approval in adult patients was granted based on results form a randomised, open-label, 
multicentre, phase 3 study called TOWER. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive blinatumomab 
(n=271) or investigator-selected, standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy (n=134). The primary 
endpoint was OS. The median OS was 4.0 months (95% CI: 2.9, 5.3) in the SOC chemotherapy arm 
compared to 7.7 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.6) in the blinatumomab arm. The OCR rates achieved in the 
blinatumomab and SOC chemotherapy arm were 43.9% (119/271; 95% CI: 37.9, 50.0) and 24.6% 
(33/134; 95% CI: 17.6, 32.8), respectively. The stand-alone CR rates for those who were treated with 
blinatumomab versus chemotherapy were 33.6% vs. 15.7%. The MRD–negative status among patients 
who achieved a CR/CRi was more frequent for patients treated with blinatumomab than chemotherapy 
(76.3% vs. 48.5%). Among patients who achieved a CR/CRi, the median DOR with blinatumomab and 
chemotherapy were 7.3 months (95% CI: 5.8, 9.9) and 4.6 months (95% CI: 1.8, 19.0), respectively. 
A total of 24% of the patients in both treatment arms underwent a subsequent allo-SCT. 
Blinatumomab was also evaluated in an open-label, multicentre, single-arm phase 2 study (MT103-
211) of 189 adult patients with Ph- r/r B-precursor ALL, which was the basis for the EU conditional 
approval in 2015. The primary endpoint was the CR/CRi rate within 2 cycles of treatment with 
blinatumomab. In total, 42.9% (81/189; 95% CI: 35.7, 50.2) of the patients achieved a CR/CRi and 
33.3% (63/189) a CR within the first 2 treatment cycles, with most of the responses occurring within 1 
cycle of treatment. A total of 17% (32/189) underwent allo-SCT while still in CR/CRi induced by 
blinatumomab. The median OS was 6.1 months (95% CI: 4.2, 7.5) (Blincyto SmPC). 
The efficacy and safety of blinatumomab in adult patients with r/r Ph+ B-precursor ALL (N=45) were 
evaluated in an open-label, multicentre, single-arm phase 2 study (ALCANTARA). Eligible patients were 
r/r to at least 1 second generation or later TKI or intolerant to second generation TKI, and intolerant or 
refractory to imatinib. The primary endpoint was the CR/CRi rate within 2 cycles of treatment with 
blinatumomab. In total, 35.6% (16/45; 95% CI: 21.9, 51.2) of the treated patients achieved a CR/CRi 
and 31.1% (14/45) a CR within the first 2 treatment cycles. A total of 11.1% (5/45) of the patients 
underwent allo-SCT while still in CR/CRi induced by blinatumomab. The median OS was 7.1 months 
(95% CI: 5.6, NE) (Blincyto SmPC). 
The response rates observed in the phase 2 portion of ZUMA-3 compare favourably to those observed 
with blinatumomab in the pivotal TOWER study. In ZUMA-3, an OCR rate of 70.9% (95% CI: 57, 82) 
was demonstrated in the mITT analysis set and 54.9% (95% CI: 43, 67) in the FAS. The confidence 
interval (CI) for the OCR rate in the mITT population of ZUMA-3 did not overlap with the CI for the 
OCR rate in the TOWER study. The median DOR observed in ZUMA-3 (12.8 months for both the mITT 
and FAS) also demonstrated a more durable response compared to that observed in the blinatumomab

arm in the TOWER study. In addition, nearly half (45%) of the patients in the mITT analysis set of 
ZUMA-3 had previously received blinatumomab and the OCR rate in these patients, even after 
blinatumomab failure, remained high at 60%. 
In conclusion, the efficacy results of brexu-cel in adult patients with r/r B-precursor ALL from ZUMA-3 
appear to be considerable better than the efficacy results reported from the three pivotal studies for 
blinatumomab (Blincyto). 
Comparative discussion of brexu-cel versus inotuzumab ozogamicin 
The anti-CD22 antibody-drug conjugate inotuzumab (Besponsa) was approved in the EU (MA in 2017) 
as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with r/r CD22+ B-precursor ALL, where patients with Ph+ 
ALL should have failed treatment with at least 1 prior second or third generation TKI. The approval was 
granted based on results from a randomized, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 study called INO-VATE. 
The patients enrolled were randomised to receive either inotuzumab (n=164) or investigator’s choice 
of chemotherapy (n=143 mITT/162 ITT), specifically fludarabine plus cytarabine plus granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (FLAG; n=93 mITT/102 ITT), mitoxantrone/ cytarabine (MXN/Ara-C; n=33 
mITT/38 ITT), or high dose cytarabine (HIDAC; N=17 mITT/ 22 ITT). A total of 85% (276/326) of the 
randomized patients had Ph- ALL, whereas 15% (49/326) had Ph+ ALL. 
The study had two co-primary endpoints: 1) CR/CRi as assessed by BIRC and 2) OS (ITT). The 
secondary endpoints included MRD negativity, DOR, SCT rates, and PFS. The OCR rates achieved in the 
inotuzumab, and chemotherapy treatment arms were 80.7% (88/109; 95% CI: 72.1, 87.7) and 29.4% 
(32/109; 95% CI: 21.0, 38.8), respectively. The stand-alone CR rates for patients who were treated 
with inotuzumab versus chemotherapy were 35.8% vs 17.4%. The MRD–negative status among those 
who achieved a CR/CRi was more frequent for patients treated with inotuzumab than chemotherapy 
(78.4% vs 28.1%). The median DOR among patients who achieved a CR/CRi with inotuzumab and 
chemotherapy were 5.4 months and 4.2 months, respectively. The study’s co-primary endpoint of 
improvement in OS with inotuzumab compared to chemotherapy was 7.7 months versus 6.2 months 
(HR 0.75 [95% CI: 0.59, 0.96]). A total of 48.2% (79/164) in the inotuzumab arm and 22.2% 
(36/162) in the chemotherapy treatment arms had a follow-up SCT. The approval for inotuzumab was 
granted based on CRs, DOR, and MRD–negative rates observed with inotuzumab (Besponsa SmPC). 
The sponsor highlighted that all randomized patients in the pivotal phase 3 study INO-VATE for 
inotuzumab (Besponsa; ITT population) had received either one (66%; 215/326; salvage 1) or two 
(33%; 108/326; salvage 2) prior lines of antineoplastic therapies for ALL, and that almost none had 
three or more prior therapies. Among the 55 patients who received brexu-cel in the phase 2 portion of 
ZUMA-3 (mITT population), 18.2% (10/55) had received one line of prior therapy, 34.5% (19/55) had 
received two lines of prior therapy, and 47.3% (26/55) had received at least 3 lines of prior therapy. 
The studied patient population in the INO-VATE study thus appear to be less heavily pre-treated than 
those enrolled into the phase 2 portion of ZUMA-3. 
The efficacy results presented for the patient population in the phase 2 portion of ZUMA-3 appear to be 
lower in terms of OCR rates than reported in the pivotal study for inotuzumab (Bensponsa) in patients 
with r/r B-precursor ALL (70.9% in the mITT and 54.9% in the FAS vs. 80.7%). Nevertheless, the 
responses observed to brexu-cel in r/r ALL patients appear to be better in terms of the CR rates than 
for inotuzumab (56.4% in the mITT and 43.7% in the FAS vs. 35.8%), and the median OS was longer 
for those treated with brexu-cel in ZUMA-3 with 18.2 months in the mITT and 19.2 months in the FAS 
compared to 7.7 months for patients treated with inotuzumab. 
Considering that outcomes in ALL significantly decrease with each line of therapy (Gokbuget et al, 
2016), the efficacy data for brexu-cel in ZUMA-3 provides evidence for an improved benefit in heavily

pre-treated patients compared to inotuzumab, for which benefits have only been demonstrated for a 
much less heavily pre-treated patient population. The median DOR in patients treated with brexu-cel in 
the phase 2 portion of ZUMA-3, defined as the time between CR/CRi to relapse or any death in absence 
of documented relapse, was 12.8 months (95% CI: 8.7, NE). In the INO-VATE study, the median DOR 
among patients who achieved a CR/CRi with inotuzumab was 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.2, 8.0). Based on 
these results, it could be concluded on a significant benefit of brexu-cel over inotuzumab (Besponsa) in 
adult patients with r/r B-precursor ALL patients based on the clinical data obtained from ZUMA-3. 
In general, the comparison across different clinical studies is technically not very informative in terms 
of quantifying the effects observed. However, taking into consideration that brexu-cel overall appeared 
to perform better than both blinatumomab and inotuzumab in terms of higher CRs and longer DOR, the 
arguments of significant benefit over currently authorised methods of treatment for the target r/r ALL 
population could be accepted based on improved efficacy.

4.  COMP position adopted on 25 July 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 1.9 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening depending on the response to 
treatment, with acute leukaemic forms being fatal in a few weeks if left untreated. Symptoms 
include persistent fever, infections, anaemia, fatigue, breathlessness, and bone and joint pain. The 
invasion of tumour cells in the bloodstream, the bone marrow and/or the lymphatic system result 
in lack of normal blood cells, bone marrow failure, and organ damage; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Tecartus may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has provided clinical study data which 
demonstrated improved and sustained complete remission rates after treatment with Tecartus as 
compared to both Blincyto and Besponsa in heavily pre-treated adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Tecartus, autologous peripheral 
blood T cells CD4 and CD8 selected and CD3 and CD28 activated transduced with retroviral vector 
expressing anti-CD19 CD28/CD3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor and cultured, brexucabtagene 
autoleucel for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (EU/3/20/2344) is not removed from the 
Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Carcinoma of the uterine corpus, often called endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer 
among women worldwide. In 2021, an estimated 66,570 new cases are expected to be diagnosed and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021 
Page 7/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately 12,940 women are expected to die of uterine cancer in the US, including EC and uterine 
sarcoma. In Europe, the estimated number of new cases and deaths from EC in 2018 were 121,600 
and 26,000, respectively. 
The MAH applied for an extension of indication for lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in 
second line endometrial carcinoma patients: 
“LENVIMA in combination with pembrolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced endometrial carcinoma (EC) who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy 
in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation (see section 5.1).“ 
Finally approved indication: 
“LENVIMA in combination with pembrolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma (EC) who have disease progression on or following prior 
treatment with a platinum-containing therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative 
surgery or radiation.’ 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium (lining of the uterus) is the most common histologic type of 
uterine cancer. Endometrial adenocarcinomas are often classified into 2 histologic categories — Type 1 
or Type 2. Type 1 tumors are more common and less aggressive, accounting for 70% to 80% of new 
cases, with endometrioid histology being the most common. In contrast, Type 2 tumors typically have 
a poorer prognosis and are not clearly associated with estrogen stimulation. These tumors consist of 
higher-grade adenocarcinomas and often have nonendometrioid histologies (eg, clear cell and serous 
cell types). In the recurrent setting, high-grade, aggressive tumors like serous and clear cell become 
more prevalent. 
Biologic features 
A recent finding has been the identification of tumors with shortening or lengthening of small repetitive 
elements in DNA, a condition called microsatellite instability. Microsatellite instability is a result of the 
inability of DNA mismatch repair enzymes to repair random mutations leading to tumorigenesis. The 
majority of patients (approximately 85%) with previously treated EC will have tumors that are not 
MSI-H or dMMR.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The prognosis for EC is significantly influenced by disease stage. At diagnosis, 67% have localized 
disease, while 21% have regional disease, and approximately 9% have distant metastases Patients 
with localized disease have a 5-year survival rate of 95%, whereas those with regional and distant 
metastatic disease have 5-year survival rates of 69% and 16.8%, respectively. Despite the favorable 
outcomes associated with early detection, approximately 20% of EC cases recur with poor prognosis. 
The population of patients with recurrent EC represents a heterogeneous mix of different histological 
subtypes and grades, stages at initial diagnosis, prior therapy, duration of recurrence-free intervals, 
and site(s) of recurrence (distant or local). In general, the prognosis is dismal for women diagnosed 
with advanced or recurrent disease, with a median survival of only 12 months.

Management 
Treatment of EC may vary depending on the grade, histology, stage of the disease, and MSI/MMR 
status. Currently, the mainstay of first-line treatment of EC is surgery with hysterectomy and bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy, with or without radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Per NCCN guidelines, 
platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard first-line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic, 
recurrent, or high-risk disease. Some subgroups of patients based on molecular profiling may benefit 
less from chemotherapy, as suggested by a retrospective analysis on the PORTEC-3 study including 
dMMR tumors that demonstrated worse outcomes compared with pMMR tumors (POLE-mutated and 
NSMP). 
The ESGO/ESTRO/ESP guidelines for the management of patients with advanced EC includes the 
following guidance for the systemic treatment of EC: 
• 
• 
The standard first-line chemotherapy is carboplatin with paclitaxel. 
There is no standard of care for second-line chemotherapy. Doxorubicin and paclitaxel are 
considered the most active therapies. In patients with a long platinum-free interval, reintroduction of 
platinum can be considered. 
• 
Anti-PD-1-based immune therapy with pembrolizumab could be considered for second line 
therapy of MSI-high/dMMR carcinomas. 
• 
The combination of pembrolizumab and the multi-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor lenvatinib could be 
considered for second-line treatment of microsatellite-stable carcinomas. However, its use may be 
limited due to regulatory approvals or reimbursement in different countries. Clinical study participation 
should be offered to all patients with disease relapse. 
Before the combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab received accelerated or equivalent approval 
in 2019 in the US, Australia, and Canada for treatment of advanced EC that is not MSI-H or dMMR, 
there was no approved therapy or generally accepted standard treatment approach for second-line EC. 
Pembrolizumab as monotherapy is approved in several countries since 2017 for a select subset of 
patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors including those with EC. Dostarlimab as monotherapy 
received a positive CHMP opinion on 25 February 2021 for the treatment of adult patients with 
recurrent or advanced mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) 
endometrial cancer (EC) that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum containing 
regimen. 
Cytotoxic chemotherapy is the de facto second-line treatment for advanced EC despite being 
associated with low response rates (≤15%), short PFS (4 months), and substantial toxicity resulting in 
poor overall survival and quality of life. While pembrolizumab monotherapy received accelerated 
approval or equivalent in some countries for MSI H/dMMR solid tumors including EC, this was based on 
the results of KEYNOTE 158, a Phase 2, single-arm study; therefore, improvement in OS compared 
with other therapies used in these patients, including chemotherapy has not been evaluated.  
Updated results of KEYNOTE-158 (data cut-off date 05 October 2020) in participants with advanced EC 
with dMMR tumors demonstrated that the ORR was 48.1%, the CR rate was 13.9%, and the median 
PFS seen with pembrolizumab monotherapy was 13.1 months, however, approximately 30% of 
participants experienced a PFS event at 3 months, illustrating the aggressive nature of previously 
treated EC.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Lenvatinib is a TKI active against both VEGFR, VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4) 
and FGFR, FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4. Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in 
pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular 
functions, including the PDGFRα, KIT, and RET.  
Lenvatinib  has  been  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  progressive,  radioiodine-
refractory  differentiated  thyroid  cancer  (RR-DTC)  and  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  under  the 
tradename  Lenvima  and  under  the  tradename  Kisplyx  for  advanced  and/or  metastatic  renal  cell 
carcinoma (RCC; 2nd line).  
Pembrolizumab  has  been  approved  in  the  EU  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
melanoma  (stage  III,  advanced  or  metastatic),  non-small  cell  lung  carcinoma,  relapsed  or  refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, recurrent or metastatic 
head  and  neck  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and  metastatic  microsatellite-instability-high  (MSI-H)  or 
mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer (see EPAR Keytruda).  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH received Scientific advice from the CHMP on 9 November 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/1375/6/2017/II). 
This Scientific advice pertained to clinical development aspects of the dossier.  
- The CHMP suggested to include ECOG PS2 patients, as inclusion of only patients with ECOG PS 0 or 1 
would preclude a significant number of real-world endometrial cancer patients being treated in second-
line  setting.  This  was  however  not  followed.  As  discussed  below,  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  of 
KEYNOTE-775  study  reflect  only  the  fitter  subpopulation  with  diagnosis  of  advanced  endometrial 
carcinoma.  
- PFS did not seem acceptable as a primary endpoint. Given the dismal prognosis of this condition and 
considering that no further efficient options would confound OS, there are no reasons to justify using 
PFS  for  a  decision  if  an  effect  on  OS  is  not  established.  In  this  study,  PFS  and  OS  are  dual  primary. 
Within this submission, both PFS and OS reached statistical significance at IA1.  
- With regard to contribution of each component, the provided information at that time seem to support 
the hypothesis of synergism; the proposed study and with an outcome of positive risk-benefit would in 
principle support a MAA, provided the guidance for one pivotal trial applications is respected. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP 
The additional pharmacodynamics studies were not performed in compliance with GLP, which is 
considered acceptable in line with the ICH guidelines.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
To support this submission for lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab, four in vivo primary 
pharmacodynamics studies conducted with lenvatinib, rat anti-murine programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) 
monoclonal antibody (mAb), clone RMP1-14, as a surrogate antibody for pembrolizumab, and the 
combination of lenvatinib with anti-PD-1 mAb were submitted. The following in vivo primary 
pharmacodynamic studies were submitted: 
• Antitumor activity in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb in the RAG murine RCC, LL/2 murine Lewis 
lung carcinoma, Hepa1-6 murine HCC, and CT26 murine colon carcinoma isograft models 
• Effects of lenvatinib in combination with anti-murine PD-1 mAb on the populations of tumour-
associated macrophages and cytotoxic T cells in the tumour microenvironment in a murine tumour 
isograft model 
• Effects of CD8+ T-cell depleting anti-murine CD8α mAb on the antitumor activity of lenvatinib in 
murine tumour isograft models 
• Effects of interferon-γ (IFN- γ) neutralizing anti-murine IFN-γ mAb on the antitumor activity of 
lenvatinib and lenvatinib in combination with anti-murine PD-1 mAb in a murine tumour isograft 
model.

2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Based on previous environmental risk assessments (ERA), lenvatinib has not been identified as a PBT 
(persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic) or a vPvB substance (very persistent and bioaccumulative) and 
there are no environmental concerns expected for lenvatinib.  
An additional ERA was performed to evaluate the potential environmental risk (PECSURFACEWATER) from the 
use of lenvatinib for the additional indication of second line EC, as well as for different combinations of 
indications. The individual PECSURFACEWATER value of lenvatinib for second line EC is below the action limit 
of 0.01 μg/L. Based on worst-case assumptions for patient populations eligible for treatment, the total 
of the lenvatinib PECSURFACEWATER values for all the indications (RR-DTC, HCC, 1L or 2L RCC & 2L EC) just 
exceeds the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. However, refining the calculation for the patient population eligible 
for 2nd line treatment for EC resulted in PECSURFACEWATER values below the action limit for all combinations. 
In  conclusion,  lenvatinib  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  risk  for  the  environment  when used  in  accordance 
with the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Lenvatinib is an oral multiple RTK inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of VEGF receptors 
VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4), in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic 
pathway-related RTKs including FGF receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the PDGF receptor PDGFRα; KIT; and 
RET.  In  vivo  human  tumour  xenograft  studies  in  athymic  mice  have  shown  that  lenvatinib  exerts 
antitumor activity against various tumour types including RCC, thyroid cancer, HCC, non-small cell lung 
cancer,  melanoma,  colorectal  cancer,  gastric  cancer,  and  ovarian  cancer,  mainly  through  its  potent 
inhibition of tumour angiogenesis driven by VEGFR and FGFR signalling.  
Assessment report

Page 16/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The new non-clinical studies conducted with lenvatinib investigated the antitumor activity of lenvatinib 
and  the  combination  of  lenvatinib  with  an  anti-PD-1  mAb  (used  as  a  surrogate  antibody  for 
pembrolizumab), in murine tumour isograft models of RCC, HCC, colon carcinoma and lung carcinoma. 
No non-clinical studies were performed in murine model of endometrial cancer, but this is considered 
acceptable in line with ICH S9. In addition, the immunomodulatory activity of lenvatinib in murine tumour 
isograft  models  using  immunocompetent  mice  and  athymic  mice  was  investigated  to  determine  the 
effects of lenvatinib on the host immune systems in the tumour microenvironment. 
Lenvatinib (10 mg/kg) in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb (10 mg/kg, 200 μg/animal, or 500 μg/animal) 
showed significant tumour growth inhibition compared to the control group against the isografts of RAG 
murine RCC, LL/2 murine Lewis lung carcinoma, Hepa1-6 murine HCC, and CT26 murine colon carcinoma 
in immunocompetent mice. Lenvatinib monotherapy and lenvatinib in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb 
showed  inhibition of  tumour  growth,  however,  the  antitumor  activity  of  the  combination  of  lenvatinib 
and  anti-PD-1  mAb  was  only  slightly  greater  than  that  of  lenvatinib  monotherapy  in  every  model 
investigated. Severe body weight loss (i.e., >20% compared to the initial day of dosing) was not noted 
for any treatment groups in these models. 
Lenvatinib  showed  greater  antitumor  activity  in  immunocompetent  mice  than  in  athymic  mice  in  the 
Hepa1-6 and CT26 isograft models, and antitumor activity in immunocompetent mice was significantly 
decreased by CD8+ T-cell depletion with the prior and concomitant injection of an anti-CD8α mAb in both 
models. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the population of tumour-associated macrophages in the 
tumour  microenvironment  was  significantly  decreased  and  populations  of  IFN-γ+CD8+  T  cells  and 
granzyme B+CD8+ T cells (both considered activated cytotoxic T cells) were significantly increased in the 
groups treated with lenvatinib and lenvatinib plus anti- PD-1 mAb. However, these experiments could 
not convincingly demonstrate an additive effect of anti-PD-1 treatment to the lenvatinib monotherapy.  
In addition, the antitumor activity of lenvatinib as well as lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 mAb was significantly 
reduced by the prior and concomitant injection of an IFN-γ neutralizing anti-murine IFN-γ mAb, but the 
antitumor activity of anti-PD-1 mAb monotherapy was not changed by anti-IFN-γ mAb in this model. 
These results suggested that in addition to its anti-angiogenesis activity, the immunomodulatory activity 
of lenvatinib involving the decrease of immunosuppressive tumour-associated macrophages, increase of 
activated cytotoxic T cells, and an activation of IFN-γ signalling contributes to its antitumor activity in 
immunocompetent mice.  
No  new  PK  or  toxicology  studies  were  conducted  with  lenvatinib  or  pembrolizumab  to  support  this 
application,  which  is  considered  acceptable  based  on  the  available  clinical  data  on  lenvatinib  and 
pembrolizumab.  
No  formal  drug-drug  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted  with  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab. 
However, since pembrolizumab is enzymatically catabolized to individual amino acids while lenvatinib is 
cleared  via  aldehyde  oxidase  and  cytochrome  P450  mediated  metabolism,  as  well  as  spontaneous 
hydrolysis, no metabolic drug interactions are expected. 
Because  pembrolizumab  was  well  tolerated  in  chronic  toxicity  studies,  the  potential  of  a  toxicologic 
interaction with lenvatinib is considered low.  
The toxicities observed with the two agents were consistent with their respective mechanisms of action, 
and  the  combination  of  lenvatinib  plus  an  anti-PD-1  mAb  (surrogate  for  pembrolizumab)  was  well 
tolerated  when  studied  in  mouse  isograft  models.  No  significant  mortality  or  body  weight  loss  was 
observed in these studies.  
In the chronic toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys with lenvatinib, target organ toxicity was 
primarily observed in the kidneys, gastro-intestinal tract, artery/arteriole in various organs, bone, and

male and female reproductive organs (testis and ovary) in both species, and in the incisor and adrenals 
in  rats.  All  these  findings  were  expected,  as  similar  findings  have  already  been  reported  in  animals 
treated  with  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  and  are  considered  related  to  the  pharmacologic 
(antiangiogenic) effects of lenvatinib. These findings were reversible and most were not evident at the 
end of a recovery period of 4 weeks. The no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for the 26- and 
39-week toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, respectively, were the lowest doses tested in 
those studies (0.4 and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively). The exposure margins at the NOAELs based on systemic 
exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours; AUC(0-24)) compared to 
exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (24 mg) were 0.7- to 0.8-fold in rats and 0.1-
fold in monkeys. 
Overall, the clinical adverse effect profiles of both agents have been well characterized in the various 
clinical trials conducted with each agent. In addition, the efficacy, safety and tolerability of lenvatinib in 
combination with pembrolizumab is being evaluated in completed/ongoing clinical studies (KEYNOTE-
146 and KEYNOTE-523 Phase 1b studies in subjects with solid tumours including EC, KEYNOTE-581 
Phase 3 in advanced RCC, KEYNOTE-775 Phase 3 study in subjects with EC). Additional data for the 
ERA regarding the prevalence of the disease population targeted by the second line EC, as well as for 
different combinations of indications were provided. Based on the updated data submitted in this 
application, the new indication does not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure 
further to the use of lenvatinib. Considering the above data, lenvatinib is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The available pharmacodynamic studies in mice tumour isograft models (RCC, HCC, colon carcinoma and 
lung  carcinoma)  showed  that  the  antitumor  activity  of  the  combination  therapy  of  lenvatinib  and  the 
anti-PD-1  mAb  (pembrolizumab)  was  greater  than  either  monotherapy,  however  the  difference  to 
lenvatinib monotherapy was not striking.  
Nevertheless, the previously established antiangiogenic activity of lenvatinib resulting from the inhibition 
of VEGFR and FGFR signalling and its immunomodulatory activity with a different mode of action from a 
PD-1  immune  checkpoint  inhibitor  (decrease  of  TAMs,  increase  of  activated  cytotoxic  T  cells  and 
activation of IFN-γ signalling) could lead to an additive effect of both components. No non-clinical studies 
were performed in murine model of endometrial cancer, but this is considered acceptable in line with 
ICH S9 and taking into account the ongoing/completed clinical trials of lenvatinib in combination with 
pembrolizumab in subjects with EC.  
The updated data submitted with this application does not lead to a significant increase in 
environmental exposure further to the use of lenvatinib. Considering the above data from the 
environmental risk assessment, lenvatinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Bioanalytical methods 
Bioanalytical methods used for the determination of lenvatinib concentration in human plasma 
The  main  biopharmaceutics  information  has  been  previously  presented  in  the  submissions  for  DTC, 
second line RCC in combination with everolimus and HCC. 
A  sensitive,  specific,  and  reproducible  method  was  developed  and  validated  for  the  determination  of 
lenvatinib (free base concentration) in human plasma (sodium heparinized) and was previously reported 
in DTC, 2L RCC, HCC and 1L RCC indications. This method was transferred from one laboratory to another 
where it was fully validated (18718AUWZ) with successful cross-validation (study RPT05042). 
ADME 
An  updated  lenvatinib  population  PK  analysis  including  data  from  updated  lenvatinib  population  PK 
information from participants treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 
was provided.  
Pembrolizumab PK and ADA were not collected in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775.  
Study KEYNOTE-775/E7080-G000-309 (hereafter Study 309/KEYNOTE-775) 
The study is a multicenter, Open-label, Randomized, Phase 3 Trial to compare the Efficacy and Safety of 
lenvatinib  in  Combination  with  Pembrolizumab  Versus  Treatment  of  Physician’s  Choice  in  Participants 
with Advanced Endometrial Cancer. 
One of the secondary objectives is to characterize the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of lenvatinib 
when co-administered with pembrolizumab in pMMR participants and in all-comer participants, especially 
to  compare  the  PK  of  lenvatinib  in  subjects  with  advanced  EC  (Study  KEYNOTE-775/309)  to  that  in 
subjects with other types of cancer across available studies of the lenvatinib clinical program and assess 
the effect of concomitant pembrolizumab on the PK of lenvatinib. 
Table 3: Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 
CPMS-E7080-015P-v1  
Population PK analysis of lenvatinib was based on pooled PK data from the 22 studies, including Study 
Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 in EC subjects. In the previous PK analysis (CPMS-E7080- 013R), lenvatinib

PK was best described by a 3-compartment model with simultaneous first and zero order absorption and 
linear elimination from the central compartment parameterized for CL/F, apparent volume of the central 
compartment  (V1/F),  apparent  volume  of  peripheral  compartments  (V2/F  and  V3/F),  inter-
compartmental clearance between V1/F and V2/F and V1/F and V3/F (Q2/F and Q3/F), absorption rate 
constant (Ka), and duration of zero-order absorption (D1) and relative bioavailability (F1rel).  
The  PK  model  included  the  following  covariates:  body  weight  on  clearances  and  volume  parameters, 
healthy subjects on CL/F, RCC and HCC subjects on CL/F, albumin <30 g/L and alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) > upper limit of normal (ULN) on CL/F, cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 inhibitors on CL/F, and capsule 
formulation on relative bioavailability (F1rel).  
In the current analysis, due to the large dataset, which resulted in a very long run time, Ka, D1, F1rel, 
V3/F  and  effect  of  healthy  subjects  and  CYP3A  inhibitors  on  CL/F  were  similar  to  those  from  many 
previous PK analyses.  
As such, these parameters were fixed to those from the recent PK analysis (CPMS-E7080-013R) and only 
effects of albumin, ALP and tumour type were re-evaluated in the PK model in addition to the effect of 
sex  and  co-medication  of  pembrolizumab  (categorical)  on  CL/F.  Estimation  of  model  parameters  was 
performed using first order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI). 
The final PK model was a 3-compartment model with simultaneous zero and first order absorption and 
first order elimination from the central compartment parameterized for CL/F, V1/F, V2/F, V3/F, Q1, Q2, 
Ka, D1, and F1rel for capsule formulation compared to tablet.  
The  full  covariate  model  included  body  weight  as  an  allometric  constant  on  clearances  and  volume 
parameters,  albumin  <  30  g/L  and  ALP  >  ULN  on  CL/F,  and  concomitant  CYP3A4  inhibitors  on  CL/F. 
Lenvatinib CL/F differences for EC, DTC, RCC, HCC and healthy subjects, as well as sex and concomitant 
pembrolizumab were also included in the full covariate model. Population PK parameter estimates from 
the final model are presented in the table below.

of parameter values were comparable with CL/F and AUC dose normalized to 20 mg in subjects with RCC 
and  other  tumour  types  received  lenvatinib  monotherapy  or  concomitantly  with  everolimus  or

showed the CWRES to be distributed around zero. Plots of ETA (CL/F) vs covariates (tumour type and 
concomitant pembrolizumab) appeared to be normally distributed with a mean of 0. The Final PK model 
was also evaluated using pcVPC.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
Lenvatinib  method  validation  (Project  n.  187184AUWZ)  as  well  as  the  bioanalytical  report  (MK-3475-
775) were submitted. The method for the determination of MK-7902 was proven to be precise, accurate, 
sensitive and selective over the validated range from 0.25 to 250 ng/mL. Dilution integrity was shown 
using  QC  samples  at  2500  ng/mL,  diluted  20  folds  and  showed  that  it  does  not  affect  precision  and 
accuracy. The method is considered reliable and reproducible, and the analyte and the internal standard 
were  stable  under  all  conditions  tested.  Long-Term  stability  of  lenvatinib  in  matrix  (human  sodium 
heparinized plasma) has been evaluated and demonstrated for a period of 6, 153, 343 and 675 days at 
-20ºC and -80°C, whereas the maximum sample storage duration from collection to analysis of study 
samples was 927 days at -20ºC.  
Long-term stability data available so far (i.e. up to 675 days) were provided. Since only 6 samples are 
not  covered  by  long-term  stability  data,  which  accounts  for  0.2%  of  the  total  samples  analysed,  no 
impact on the outcome of BA study is expected. Long term stability data up to 927 days will be available 
early 2022. 
Only  2452  samples  out  of  4423  were  analysed  which  corresponds  to  more  than  half  samples.  It  is 
adequately clarified that the Aliquot 2 samples were back-up samples that were only used if the Aliquot 
1 sample was not available or not viable. An adequate justification was also provided by the applicant to 
explain why 6 samples were not analyzed. 
Three different instruments for LC-MS/MS analysis, coded LC MS MS 4000 01, LC MS MS 4000 13 and 
LC MS MS 4000 17 were used; Multiple LC MS/MS systems were used and found to be equivalent during 
assay development and the performances (calibration curves, Y intercept, slope) were comparable across 
systems.  It  was  also  clarified  that  no  changes  were  made  to  the  validated  instrument  platform  and 
therefore partial validations were not warranted. 
Lenvatinib POP PK analysis 
An  updated  lenvatinib  population  PK  analysis  (CPMS-E7080-015R-v1)  including  data  from  updated 
lenvatinib  population  PK  information  from  participants  treated  with  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  in 
Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 was provided. The PK of lenvatinib was described by a 3-compartment model 
with elimination from the central compartment and simultaneous first and zero order absorption. The 
model  was  parameterized  for  CL/F,  V1/F,  Q2/F,  V2/F,  Q3/F,  V3/F,  Ka,  D1  and  F1.  The  final  pooled 
lenvatinib PK dataset included 25738 observations from a total of 3025 subjects. For EC subjects, there 
were  2178  lenvatinib  concentrations  available  from  403  subjects  from  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775.  The 
updated  lenvatinib  PK  profile  containing  data  from  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  is  consistent  with  the 
current population PK profile of lenvatinib. 
Of note, a lot of Lenvatinib observations were excluded from PK Dataset as “outlier, inconsistent with 
the  PK  profile.  It  was  clarified  that  only  1.4%  of  total  observations  were  excluded  due  to  BLQ  TAD< 
200h. It is agreed that exclusion of these BLQ samples does not bias the parameter estimates.

According  to  the  provided  model,  EC  subjects  had  24.9%  lower  apparent  total  clearance  following 
extravascular  (e.g.  oral)  administration  (CL/F)  than  that  in  subjects  with  other  types  of  solid  tumour 
excluding DTC, RCC and HCC. The lower CL of lenvatinib observed in EC patients would appear not to 
be  due  to  the  effect  of  the  combination  with  pembrolizumab,  as  lenvatinib  CL  is  equal  in  both  the 
presence (yes) and absence (no) of pembrolizumab, indicating that there is no effect of pembrolizumab 
co-administration on lenvatinib. The reason why the CL of lenvatinib is lower in EC patients compared 
with RCC and HCC patients is currently unknown. However, as the magnitude of this effect in EC patients 
(24.9%) is within the inter-subject variability for CL (33.5%), this is of no apparent clinical relevance. 
Concomitant pembrolizumab dosing had no clinically relevant effect on lenvatinib pharmacokinetic (PK). 
There  was  a  statistically  significant  small  effect  of  gender  on  lenvatinib  PK,  which  is  not  considered 
clinically relevant. 
Goodness-of-fit-plots for the final PK model for lenvatinib based on the pooled dataset were presented, 
the scatter plots of CWRES vs. population predicted concentrations and vs. time showed the CWRES to 
be distributed around zero. 
Plots of ETA (CL/F) vs covariates (tumour type and concomitant pembrolizumab) appeared to be normally 
distributed with a mean of 0. 
During the first round, the Final PK model was also evaluated using pcVPC. Prediction-Corrected Visual 
Predictive Check of Observed and Predicted Lenvatinib concentrations in overall population considered 
in  the  final  model  (popPK  analysis  of  lenvatinib  from  all  studies)  both  including  and  excluding  Study 
309/KEYNOTE-775 (pcVPC including the 21 studies considered other than Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 and 
also pcVPC for all subjects considered from the 22 studies included in the updated final popPK model) 
were provided.  
In summary, the final model fitting performance on EC data is overall acceptable.  
The information on special populations is unchanged from the original DTC (Lenvima) and RCC 
(Kisplyx) indications. It has been reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC that no adjustment of starting 
dose was required on the basis of hepatic function or renal function in Study 309/KEYNOTE775. Dose 
adjustments in this population may be necessary on the basis of individual tolerability. 
No pharmacokinetic interaction studies were provided. In general, the potential of DDI between biologics 
and small molecules is negligible. Given the divergent metabolic pathways for both compounds, no DDI 
liability is expected on pembrolizumab and lenvatinib when administered in combination with each other. 
Based on the review of the submitted data, no change in the SmPC is needed from a PK perspective, 
except in section 5.2., the subsection on age, sex, weight and race which has been revised to reflect 
that based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients receiving up to 24 mg lenvatinib once 
daily,  age,  sex,  weight,  and  race  (Japanese  vs.  other,  Caucasian  vs.  other)  had  no  clinically  relevant 
effects on clearance (see section 4.2).  
Finally, as the pembrolizumab dosage of 400 mg Q6W has been approved for all adult indications for 
monotherapy  and  combination  indications  in  the  US  and  the  EU,  the  400  mg  Q6W  dosing  regimen is 
expected to have a similar benefit-risk profile as the 200 mg Q3W (or 2 mg/kg Q3W) dosing regimen in 
the clinical use of pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib in adults with advanced EC. Therefore, 
the alternate 400 mg Q6W dosing has been included in the Lenvima SmPC section 4.2.

2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The updated lenvatinib PK model containing data from Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 was consistent with the 
current population PK profile of lenvatinib.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Study E7080-A001-111/KEYNOTE-146 
The proposed clinical dose is lenvatinib 20 mg QD combined with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W for 
the patients with confirmed advanced EC. This dose was defined based on the efficacy and safety 
results from the phase 1b/2 E7080-A001-111/KEYNOTE-146 study.  
Study E7080-A001-111/KEYNOTE-146 is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b/2 study of the 
combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in subjects with metastatic solid tumour including EC.

No new safety signal or risk was identified for either lenvatinib or pembrolizumab or the combination 
from this trial. Observed toxicities were generally similar to those previously reported with either study 
drug when used as monotherapy, except for an overall higher incidence of AEOSIs observed for the 
combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy, primarily driven by 
a higher frequency of hypothyroidism.

Study E7080-G000-309 (Study 309)/KEYNOTE-775 
A Multicenter, Open-label, Randomized, Phase 3 Trial to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of 
Lenvatinib in Combination with Pembrolizumab Versus Treatment of Physician’s Choice in 
Participants with Advanced Endometrial Cancer 
Methods 
This is an ongoing multicenter, open-label, randomized, Phase 3 trial to compare the efficacy and 
safety of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib versus treatment of physician’s choice (TPC) in the patients 
with advanced endometrial carcinoma.  
Participants were 1:1 ratio randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib or TPC 
with either doxorubicin or paclitaxel.

all-comer participants. 
Sample size 
The sample size is estimated based on the primary endpoints PFS and OS.  
A total of approximately 780 participants (including 660 participants from pMMR and 120 participants 
from dMMR participants) were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 330 participants 
from pMMR and 60 participants from dMMR participants in each treatment arm). 
The study was considered to have completed enrollment when 660 pMMR participants have enrolled. 
Enrollment of dMMR participants was planned to be capped at 120. 
Sample size and power calculations are based on pMMR participants: 
The study is designed to have 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference in OS at one-
sided α=0.0245 and as a result, the study will also have at least 99% power to detect a statistical 
significant difference in PFS at one-sided α=0.0005. 
Assuming an accrual period of 19 months and a follow-up period of 24 months, a total of 660 
participants are required to observe 526 death events by the time of 43 months after the first 
participant is randomized (19 months enrollment plus 24 months follow-up period). 
For OS, a total of 526 OS events are required to detect a statistically significant difference at 0.0245 
level with 90% power, under the following assumptions that: 1) the hazard ratio is 0.75 (median OS is 
16.4 months in Arm A and 12.3 months in Arm B), 2) the first interim analysis is performed when 
approximately 368 OS events are observed (i.e. 70% of the total target death events), 3) the second 
interim analysis is performed when approximately 463 OS events are observed (i.e. 88% of the total 
target death events), and 4) Lan-DeMets spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundary is used. 
The final PFS analysis is planned to be performed at the time of the first OS interim analysis (IA1) at 
27 months after the first participant is randomized. A total of 564 PFS events are estimated to be 
observed to detect a statistically significant difference at 0.0005 level with >99% power under the 
assumption that the hazard ratio is 0.55 (median PFS is 7.3 months in Arm A and 4 months in Arm B). 
Power calculations are based on pMMR and dMMR participants combined (all comer): 
Assuming an accrual period of 19 months and a follow-up period of 24 months, a total of 780 
participants are required in the all comer population to observe 618 death events by the time of 43 
months after the first participant is randomized (19 months enrollment plus 24 months follow-up 
period). For OS, a total of 618 OS events are required to detect a statistically significant difference at 
0.02205 level with 93.5% power, under the following assumptions that: 1) the hazard ratio is 0.75 
(median OS is 16.4 months in Arm A and 12.3 months in Arm B), 2) the first interim analysis is 
performed when approximately 433 OS events are observed (i.e. 70% of the total target death 
events), 3) the second interim analysis is performed when approximately 544 OS events are observed 
(i.e. 88% of the total target death events), and 4) Lan-DeMets spending function with O’Brien-Fleming 
boundary is used.

Randomisation 
Treatment allocation/randomization occurred centrally using an interactive response technology (IRT) 
system. Participants will be assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to either Arm A or Arm B. Treatment 
allocation/randomization was stratified according to the following factors: 
1. MMR status (pMMR or dMMR) 
2. ECOG performance status (0 or 1) 
3. Geographic region (Region 1 [Europe, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel] or Region 2 
[rest of the world]) 
4. Prior history of pelvic radiation (yes or no) 
First, participants will be stratified according to MMR status. Then, only within the pMMR stratum, 
participants will be further stratified according to ECOG performance status, geographic region, and 
prior history of pelvic radiation. A total of 9 strata will be utilized for the study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study 309/KEYNOTE-775 is an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population served as the population for the primary efficacy analyses. 
Efficacy analyses were planned to be performed in two subsets of subjects: All-comer participants and 
pMMR participants. In addition, select analyses may be performed for dMMR participants. All analyses 
performed in dMMR participants will be based on unstratified models for each endpoint. Although MMR 
status is a stratification factor in the trial, summary of pMMR and dMMR participants will be based on 
actual MMR status defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed by a central vendor on tumor 
tissue provided by sites. If a participant is stratified as dMMR, but is determined to be pMMR by IHC, 
then stratification factors for the participant will be imputed based on clinical data. 
Efficacy results for pMMR participants and all-comer participants that will be deemed to be statistically 
significant after consideration of the Type I error control strategy described below. Nominal p-values 
will be computed for other efficacy analyses, but should be interpreted with caution due to potential 
issues of multiplicity. 
The stratification factors used for randomization (see below) will be applied to all stratified analyses, in 
particular, the stratified log-rank test, stratified Cox model, and stratified Miettinen and Nurminen 
method. In the event that there are small strata, for the purpose of analysis, strata will be combined 
to ensure sufficient number of participants, responses and events in each stratum. 
Since, stratification is layered in this study, first according to the MMR status for all subjects and then 
by ECOG, region and pelvic radiation history only within the pMMR stratum, the stratification will be 
different for the pMMR and all-comer analyses. All stratified analyses based on the all-comer 
population will include all 4 stratification variables in the model (9 strata), while the model for the 
pMMR population will include stratification variables for ECOG, region and pelvic radiation history (8 
strata). 
Analysis sets 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021 
Page 37/154 
 
 
 
 
The All-comer Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all randomized participants who have received at 
least one dose of study medication, and have completed at least one PRO assessment beyond baseline. 
Participants in the All-comer Full Analysis Set who have pMMR status are included in the pMMR Full 
Analysis Set. 
Unless otherwise specified, all the analyses were performed for the pMMR Full Analysis Set as well as 
the All-comer Full Analysis Set. 
Multiplicity testing strategy 
The study initially allocated α = 0.0005, one-sided, to test PFS for pMMR participants and initially 
allocated α =0.0245, one-sided, to test OS for pMMR participants between the 2 treatment arms. If the 
null hypothesis for PFS for pMMR was rejected, α = 0.0005 was then passed to the test for PFS for all-
comer participants. And if the null hypothesis for PFS for all-comer participants was rejected, α = 
0.0005 was then passed to the test for OS for pMMR; therefore, OS for pMMR was tested at α =0.025. 
The study was considered positive if either testing of PFS or testing of OS was significant in pMMR 
participants. 
The total family-wise error rate (Type-I error) among the dual-primary PFS and OS and the secondary 
ORR endpoints is strongly controlled at one-sided 0.025 level. The multiplicity strategy will follow the 
graphical approach of Maurer and Bretz (Figure below) shows the initial one-sided α-allocation for each 
hypothesis in the ellipse representing the hypothesis. The initial weights for reallocation from each 
hypothesis to the others are represented in the boxes on the lines connecting hypotheses.

Abbreviations: ORR = objective response rate; OS = overall survival; PFS = progression-free survival; pMMR =

The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the PFS curve and survival curves 
respectively and the treatment differences in PFS and OS were assessed by the stratified log-rank test. 
Stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method was used for comparison of the ORR between two 
treatment groups.

Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations were classified as per the ICH E3 classification of protocol deviations as important 
(those that may significantly impact the quality or integrity of key study data or that may significantly 
affect a participant’s rights, safety, or well-being) or not important. Important protocol deviations were 
further classified as either clinically important (deviations that may compromise critical data analyses 
pertaining to primary efficacy and/or safety endpoints or the participant’s safety) or not clinically 
important.  
Assessment report

Important protocol deviations were reported for 51 participants in this study. The number of 
participants with important deviations was 27 (6.6%) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 24 
(5.8%) in the TPC groups respectively.  
Of the important protocol deviations, 20 participants had deviations that were considered to be 
clinically important and are categorized as follows: 
• Study intervention (n=7 for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab; n=5 for TPC) 
• Received improperly stored study intervention (n=6 for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab; n=3 for TPC) 
• Study intervention was dispensed that was not assigned in the allocation schedule (n=1 for 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab; n=2 for TPC). For the 3 participants with important protocol deviations 
under this category, they received the wrong dosage of medications. 
• Discontinuation criteria were met, but participants were not discontinued from the study medication 
(n=5 for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab; n=3 for TPC) 
• Prohibited medication (n=1 for TPC) 
No participant’s data were excluded from analyses due to an important protocol deviation. 
Table 14: Summary of Important Protocol Deviations Considered to be Clinically Important 
(ITT Population) 
Baseline data 
All randomized participants were female with a diagnosis of advanced EC who had been treated with at 
least 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (except for 1 participant).  
The baseline demographic characteristics of participants with pMMR EC, all-comer, and dMMR 
participants were generally balanced between the 2 treatment groups, had a median age 65 years 
(65.0 years in Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 66.0 years in TPC arm respectively; 64 in the 
dMMR subgroup).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021 
Page 44/154 
 
 
 
 
Most patients (61.3%) are white, 21.4% are Asian, and had an ECOG performance status of 0 
(58.9%). 84.3% patients (346 in Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 351 in TPC arm) had a pMMR 
tumour.  
The baseline disease characteristics of participants with pMMR EC and all-comer participants were 
generally balanced between the 2 treatment groups and were reflective of the patient population with 
advanced EC. Of 827 all-comer participants, 497 participants had endometroid carcinoma, and 330 
participants had non-endometroid carcinoma. Of 697 pMMR participants, 386 had endometroid 
carcinoma, and 311 had non-endometroid carcinoma. Of 130 dMMR participants, 111 had endometroid 
carcinoma, and 19 had non-endometroid carcinoma.

In general, the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and TPC groups were balanced for baseline clinical 
characteristics, prior systemic therapies for EC and concomitant medications, in all randomized patient 
population as well as in pMMR patient subgroup. Patients recruited globally.  White and Asian 
population account for the majority of patients enrolled Median Age (range) is 65.0 years (65.0 years 
in Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 66.0 years in TPC arm respectively). Most patients (about 
60%) are white, one fifth are Asian, and more than half patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 
in both treatment groups. No differences on the distribution of metastatic lesions were observed.  
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy Analysis Population 
Efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population, which included participants in the treatment arm 
to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of whether they received treatment. The following 
ITT populations were included: all-comer participants and pMMR participants. No participants were 
excluded from the analyses. The analyses included 1 participant who was stratified with a dMMR 
status, but actually had a pMMR status; stratification factors for this participant are derived from actual 
ECOG performance status, geographic region, and prior history of pelvic radiation.  
PRO Analysis Population 
The HRQoL analyses are based on the HRQoL Full Analysis Set (PRO FAS) population, defined as all 
randomized participants who had at least one HRQoL assessment available for the specific endpoint 
and had received at least 1 dose of study intervention. Participants were analyzed in the treatment 
group to which they were randomized. HRQoL analysis populations included an all-comer FAS and a 
pMMR FAS. 
Safety Analysis Population 
Safety analyses were based on the APaT population, which included all randomly assigned participants 
who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. APaT populations: all-comer and pMMR participants.

Outcomes and estimation 
The MAH provided the results of IA1- final efficacy analysis for PFS and interim efficacy analysis for OS 
in both pMMR and all-comer participants. As of the data cutoff date (26-OCT-2020), the median 
duration of follow-up was 12 months in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 10.8 months in 
the TPC group.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Objective response rate (ORR) 
In all randomised patients, ORR was 31.9% in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 14.7% in 
the TPC group respectively, with an estimated difference of 17.2% (95% CI: 11.5, 22.9; p<0.0001)  
For pMMR patients, ORR was 30.3% in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 15.1% in the TPC 
group respectively, with an estimated difference of 15.2% (95% CI: 9.1, 21.4.7; p<0.0001) 
Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-30) 
The global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) score of EORTC QLQ-30 was a secondary endpoint. 
The schedule for PRO data collection is described in supplemental SAP-01 (17 NOV 2020) and was 
planned to occur at least until week 24. At each scheduled visit, three instruments, EORTC QLQ-C30, 
EORTC QLQ-EN24 and EQ-5D, were collected.  
In pMMR participants, completion rate of the EORTC QLQ-C30 was above 95% in both the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab and TPC groups at baseline. The completion rate for pMMR participants remained 
above 60% through Week 12 (77.8% vs 61.7% for the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and TPC groups, 
respectively). Compliance rates at baseline were also above 96% in both arms. Compliance remained 
high through Week 12 (91.8% for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 86.9% for TPC group). 
In All-comer Participants, completion rate of the EORTC QLQ-C30 was above 95% in both the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and TPC groups at baseline. The completion rate for all-comer 
participants remained above 60% through Week 12 (79.9% vs 62.4% for the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab and TPC groups, respectively). Completion rates dropped gradually for both arms as 
the trial progressed likely because of the reduction in the number of patients scheduled to finish the 
questionnaires at each time point as a result of disease progression, adverse event, or death. 
Compliance rates at baseline were also above 96% in both arms. Compliance remained high through 
Week 12 (91.8% for Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 86.9% for TPC). 
The completion rates and compliance rates in both pMMR and all-comer participants for EORTC QLQ-
EN24 and EQ-5D were consistent with those for EORTC QLQ-C30. 
In both Al-comer patients and pMMR population, the differences in score change from baseline to week 
12 for EORTC-QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL scale between lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and TPC groups were 
not significantly different.

not prespecified in the multiplicity strategy for Type I error control, so only nominal p-values are provided 
for the efficacy endpoints. 
The clinical characteristics in dMMR participants were comparable between the two treatment groups, 
with a median age of 65 years, nearly 60% white race as well as almost 20% Asian, and had half patients 
with ECOG performance status of 0.

Subsequent Systemic Anti-Cancer Treatment  
For all randomised patients, 28% patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 48% 
patients in the TPC group received at least 1 subsequent systemic anticancer therapy.  7.7% patients 
(n=32) in the TPC group switched to lenvatinib and pembrolizumab afterwards. Compared with the 
lenvatinib and pembrolizumab group, more patients in TPC group switched to the subsequent PD 1/PD 
L1 checkpoint and VEGF/ VEGFR inhibition treatment (PD 1/PD L1 checkpoint:  12.7% patients (n=53) 
vs 1.0% patients (n=4), VEGF/VEGFR inhibitor: 11.1% patients (n=46) VS 2.4% patient (n=10)). Of 
note, 2 patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group received subsequent oncologic surgeries 
compared with 13 cases in TPC group.  A total of 82 patients (9.9%) received subsequent radiation, 
including 27 case in combination treatment group (6.6%) and 55 cases in TPC (13.2%). In pMMR 
patients, the similar differences on the subsequent systemic treatment were observed.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose response study 
The  lenvatinib  dose  of  20  mg  QD  used  in  combination  with  pembrolizumab  200  mg  Q3W  in  treating 
advanced EC was established in a Phase 1b/2 Study E7080-A001-111/KEYNOTE-146. In the dose-finding 
phase, 3 subjects received 24 mg QD of lenvatinib (i.e. the recommended monotherapy dose in DTC) 
however due to DLT (G3 arthralgia and G3 fatigue) the dose was de-escalated to 20 mg QD, no further 
DLT were observed and this was considered the RP2D. Pembrolizumab was used only at its recommended 
dose of 200 mg /Q3W. In the KEYNOTE-775, approximately 66% of subjects had to reduce the dose of 
lenvatinib due to side effect.  
Pivotal study 
This application is based on the results of a single pivotal phase 3 trial Study 309/KEYNOTE-775. 
The open-label design is not optimal, though understood in the context of the differences of treatment 
in  the  two  arms  and  different  toxicities.  The  blinded  review  of  images  to  determine  ORR  and  PFS  is 
endorsed. In the control arm more patients did not receive the treatment they were randomized to and 
more patients discontinued therapy due to subject or physician’s decision. 
780 participants were planned to be randomized, and a total of 827 participants were actually enrolled 
in this study (697 pMMR and 130 dMMR). 
Assessment report

The number of OS and PFS events at each respective final analyses has increased (in particular PFS) 
with  the  last  protocol  amendment  7  compared  to  the  original  protocol  and  prior  amendments,  which 
were mainly related to the additional follow-up.  
The total family-wise error rate (Type-I error) among the 2 primary PFS and OS analyses, ORR analysis, 
and  for  pMMR  and  all-comer  participants  was  controlled  at  one-sided  0.025  level.  Doxorubicin  and 
paclitaxel  were  still  regarded  as  valid  second-line  treatment  options  after  platinum-based  first-line 
treatment of endometrial cancer during the scientific advice. 
In  this  study,  all  patients  were  first  stratified  by  MMR  status,  then  only  within  the  pMMR  stratum, 
participants were further stratified with 3 stratification factors, according to ECOG performance status 
(0 or 1), geographic region (Region 1 [Europe, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel] or Region 
2 [rest of the world]), and prior history of pelvic radiation (yes or no), which were considered important 
prognostic factors for this study population. 
Either lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab or TPC chemotherapy were used in patients who 
have disease progression after prior systemic therapy, and are not eligible for curative surgery or 
radiation. More precisely, per the inclusion criterion 3, the eligible patients should have previously 
been treated with a total of 1 or 2 prior systemic, platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for EC 
(including up to one prior line of chemotherapy in adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant setting), which is 
currently considered the standard first-line treatment in EC and received nearly by all patients. 
Therefore, the indication was modified in order to specify the use of prior platinum-based therapy and 
add “recurrent” to the wording in the Lenvima SmPC section 4.1. 
Approximately 35% of subjects in both arms received study treatment as first line for 
advanced/metastatic setting, after relapse to platinum-based chemotherapy received as (neo)adjuvant 
therapy. This population appear balanced between the two arms regarding platinum-free interval (PFI), 
with overall few patients with PFI≥12 months, as expected. Benefit of lenvatinib + pembrolizumab as 
compared to standard chemotherapy is retained also in patients treated in first line.  
Only patients with ECOG performance status 0 or 1 were enrolled in this trial. The exclusion of patients 
with ECOG ≥2 from clinical studies (except for thyroid carcinoma) is mentioned in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC. In the description of Study 309- KEYNOTE-775 study in section 5.1 of the SmPC the baseline 
ECOG is reported as “ECOG PS of 0 (59%) or 1 (41%)”. The combination may be used also in less fit 
patients based on physician’s judgment thanks to the manageable safety profile of the treatment. 
In terms of the prior treatments, the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and TPC groups were comparable 
for all reported prior therapies used for EC including the pMMR population. Per inclusion criteria, there 
was no restriction regarding prior hormonal therapy. The use of prior hormonal therapy was low in 
both all-comer participants (9.7%) and pMMR participants (9.3%) and generally comparable between 
the 2 treatment groups.  
Despite both doxorubicin and paclitaxel were deemed as prevailing treatment options after platinum-
based first-line treatment of endometrial cancer, heterogeneity within this control group due to 
different objective response to advanced EC in the second line is of concern. Less than 30% of subjects 
in the control arm received paclitaxel (both in the ITT as well as in the pMMR population). For patients 
in the control arm receiving paclitaxel outcome is similar regardless whether they have received 
paclitaxel previously.  
When analyzed by chemotherapy chosen prior to randomization for all randomized participant, an 
advantage of the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab combination is maintained vs each control chemotherapy 
paclitaxel and doxorubicin, with the exception of a modestly shorter OS for patients treated with 
lenvatinib and pembrolizumab compared with participants treated with paclitaxel. However, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021 
Page 76/154 
 
 
 
 
performance of patients treated with doxorubicin in the control arm appear unexpectedly inferior to 
patients who received paclitaxel. Considering the number of patients who received paclitaxel is limited, 
no definitive conclusion could be drawn on it. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At the data cut-off date of 26 October 2020, within all 827 randomised patients, 411 patients received 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 416 received TPC. The results of the Interim Analysis 1 (i.e. final 
for PFS, interim for OS) were provided. The median duration of follow up in the overall population of 
11.4 months (range 0.3, 26.9).  
Baseline characteristics 
The baseline characteristics was generally well balanced between the 2 arms in unselected patients. 
Median age (range) is 65.0 years (65.0 years in lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 66.0 years in 
TPC arm, respectively). Most patients (about 60%) are white, one fifth are Asian, and more than half 
patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 in both treatment groups. No differences on the 
distribution of metastatic lesions were found. Similar prior anti-cancer therapies were given between 
groups.  
A biomarker-defined patient population (negative selection) represents 84.3% of the all-comers 
population. 697 patients (346 in Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 351 in TPC arm) had a pMMR 
tumour, while the remaining patients had dMMR tumours defined by a biomarker assay. Similarly, 
there were no notable differences in the baseline characteristics between two arms in pMMR and dMMR 
patients. 
In total, all randomised 827 patients were included as ITT population for primary analysis (411 in 
Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 416 in TPC group), 697 patients were analysed as pMMR ITT 
population. 
As histology is a prognostic factor, the available data on histology (endometrioid/non endometrioid) 
were provided in all the populations in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 and supportive studies. Most 
participants were enrolled with an endometrioid histology. No relevant differences are seen in histology 
(endometrioid vs non endometrioid). In the dMMR population of KEYNOTE-775 study, most of the 
subjects have also endometrioid histology, which is in line with the characteristics of dMMR EC. 
Primary endpoint  
At the time of data cut-off date (26 October 2020), the median follow-up duration was about 11 
months in each treatment group. In lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group, 184 (44.8%) deaths were 
observed among 406 treated patients. In TPC group, 236 deaths (56.7%) were observed in 388 
treated patients. Overall, 124 patients (30.5%) in the combination treatment group and 10 (2.6%) in 
TPC group continued the study treatment. 
For all randomised patients, a gain of 3.4 months (7.2 months vs 3.8 months) in median PFS by BICR 
was shown in patients treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared with TPC, with HR of 0.56 
(95% CI: 0.47, 0.66; p<0.0001, one-sided).  
An alike proportion of patients in both arms had PD due to progression of a target or non-target lesion, 
or developing new lesions. Overall, 101 (24.6%) patients in the combination therapy group vs 35 
(8.4%) patients in the TPC group were progression-free at the time of analysis.   
Both PFS rates over time and the shape of KM curves for PFS indicated the superiority in PFS outcome 
in lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab over TPC. The effect was maintained throughout the duration of the 
evaluation period in all randomised patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021 
Page 77/154 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy results for the TPC arm (doxorubicin and paclitaxel) in the all-comers population are 
consistent with those from other randomized Phase 3 studies in a similar treatment setting. 
The results for the PFS by investigator assessment (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.66; p<0.0001, one 
sided; median PFS 7.3 months vs 4.2 months for Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab vs TPC, respectively) 
were consistent with the PFS analysis by BICR. The median PFS based on investigator assessment per 
iRECIST in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group was substantially longer than that of TPC group 
(10.3 months vs 5.6 months, HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.57 p<0.0001, one-sided). Both sensitivity 
analyses support primary analysis. The rate of agreement between INV and BICR was approximately 
80-85%.  
The median OS in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group was 18.3 months, indicating an 
improvement compared the median OS in TPC group of 11.4 months, HR of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.75; 
p<0.0001, one-sided). However, OS analysis is not mature yet as in lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
and TPC groups, 44.8% and 56.7% maturity was reported, respectively.  
In the pMMR population, a statistically significant improvement in median PFS by BICR was shown for 
the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  treatment  compared  with  TPC  (median  PFS  of  6.6  months  vs  3.8 
months, HR of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.72; p<0.0001, one-sided). The favouring trend of the PFS rates 
over  time  and  KM  curves  supported  better  efficacy  of  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  over  TPC 
consistently throughout the duration of the evaluation period. The results from both sensitivity analyses 
with a different set of censoring rules supported the robustness of PFS results in pMMR population. 
Even though the median OS improvement was found in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group over 
TPC in all comers and in the pMMR population, OS data is not fully mature yet and this limits the efficacy 
estimation at this moment. The MAH is recommended to submit the results from the final OS analysis in 
the overall population and by MMR biomarker by Q4 2022. 
The  significant  superiority  in  terms  of  PFS  and  OS  is  maintained  after  multiplicity  correction  in  all 
randomised patients and pMMR subgroup. 
The subsequent treatment after progression, especially PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors and/ or VEGF/ 
VEGFR  inhibitors  use,  has  to  be  considered  as  a  confounding  factor  for  the  long-term  survival  data 
analysis. Despite more patients in TPC group received the subsequent systemic treatment (including PD-
1/PD-L1 checkpoint and VEGF/ VEGFR inhibition) compared with the combination treatment group, the 
improved outcomes for OS in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group compared with the TPC group 
were still observed.   
Approximately  30%  of  subjects  in  the  pembrolizumab  +  lenvatinib  arm  received  treatment  beyond 
RECIST 1.1-defined and investigator assessed disease progression for a median of 2.8 months, compared 
to <5% in the control arm who continued chemotherapy for a median of 1.7 months. This difference is 
not  unexpected,  as  indicated  in  the  Keytruda  SmPC  “It  is  recommended  to  continue  treatment  for 
clinically  stable  patients  with  initial  evidence  of  disease  progression  until  disease  progression  is 
confirmed.” 
Efficacy data in patients who continued treatment with lenvatinib and/or pembrolizumab beyond RECIST 
1.1  disease  progression  were  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis,  raising  no  concern.  However,  the 
number  of  participants  in  the  TPC  arm  who  continued  treatment  with  chemotherapy  beyond  disease 
progression  by  Investigator  Assessment  (n=16)  is  small  and  thus  a  meaningful  analysis  cannot  be 
performed. 
Among patients discontinuing due to AE, subsequent therapies were administered less frequently after 
lenvatinib  +  pembrolizumab  compared  to  patients  in  the  control  arm  (23.3%  vs  39.4%).  There  is 
insufficient  data  to  determine  why  participants  did  not  start  subsequent  systemic  anticancer  therapy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021 
Page 78/154 
 
 
 
 
following  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  due  to  AE,  as  well  as  limited  information  on  subsequent 
anticancer therapies may have been available for participants who discontinued study treatment due to 
an AE and then withdrew consent from further participation in the study.  
Time  from  discontinuation  due  to  AE  to  disease  progression  was  shorter  in  the  lenvatinib  + 
pembrolizumab arm than in the control arm, however the outcome in terms of OS and PFS of patients 
who discontinued treatment due to AE in the two arms appear similar.  
Secondary endpoints 
The results of secondary endpoints generally support the PFS and OS results.  
In all randomised patients, ORR was 31.9% in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 14.7% in 
the TPC group respectively, with an estimated difference of 17.2% (95% CI: 11.5, 22.9; p<0.0001). 
For pMMR patients, ORR was 30.3% in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 15.1% in the TPC 
group respectively, with an estimated difference of 15.2% (95% CI: 9.1, 21.4.7; p<0.0001). ORR 
results supported the relevant results on PFS and OS favouring lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
treatment.  
Exploratory Endpoints  
For  all  randomised  patients,  the  median  TTR  in  both  treatment  groups  are  the  same:  2.1  months; 
however in pMMR population, the median TTR for doxorubicin-treated patients is longer at 3.6 vs 2.1 
months in the all comers. These data should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of 
responding patients for whom TTR is calculated.  
For other endpoints, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab treatment prolonged median DOR, DCR, CBR and 
PFS2 relative to TPC.  
Patient reported outcomes (PRO) 
The  main  PRO  variable  for  HRQoL  analysis  was  Global  HRQoL  score  (global  health  status/QoL) of  the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 reviewed as a secondary endpoint. EORTC QLQ-C30 physical functioning score, EORTC 
QLQ EN24 urological symptoms score, and EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L VAS score were exploratory endpoints.  
In both all randomised patients and pMMR population, comparable score change from baseline to week 
12 for EORTC-QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL scale was informative to ensure a similar impact on quality of life for 
both lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and TPC groups.  
The overall compliance rates for the QLQ-C30 were high in both treatment arms up to 12 weeks. The 
treatment arms were balanced in terms of baseline scores. Within the all-comers population, the adjusted 
mean  change  from  baseline  in  EORTC  QLQ-C30  global  HRQoL  score  at  week  12  was  -5.97  in  the 
combination treatment group (386 evaluable patients) and -6.98 in TPC group (363 evaluable patients), 
with  a  corresponding  estimated  difference  of  LS  mean  score  change  from  baseline  between  two 
treatment groups at Week 12 was (1.01 points; 95% CI: -2.28, 4.31, p=0.5460). 
In pMMR population, there was also no significant difference observed in LS mean score change from 
baseline between two treatment groups at Week 12 was (1.16 points; 95% CI: -2.49, 4.81, p=0.5316). 
EORTC QLQ-30 physical functioning scores and EQ-5D-5L VAS scores decreased slightly in both the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and TPC group and were generally similar between the 2 groups 
during the evaluation period EORTC QLQ-EN24 urological symptoms scores were maintained over time 
and were also generally similar between two treatment groups. 
In conclusion, no major differences are seen between arms in the PRO. However, PRO data in the context 
of an open-label study should be interpreted with caution.

Subgroup analyses 
In the subgroup analyses for all randomised patients and pMMR population, the treatment benefit for 
PFS and OS for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared with TPC is generally consistent across the 
major subgroups. There is a sign that non-white patients and the patients who have received more 
than one line previous systemic therapies are less likely to benefit from lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
treatment over TPC, but the number of patients is limited to draw any firm conclusion.  
dMMR 
In Study 309/KEYNOTE-775, dMMR participants represent a relatively small subset of the all-comers 
population, reflecting its low prevalence in clinical practice. Despite the upper 95% CI for the PFS and 
OS are still not reached at time of data cutoff date, the currently available data indicated PFS and OS 
benefit, similarly to both ITT populations.  
The median follow-up duration was 13.5 months in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 8.8 
months in the TPC group. In dMMR patients, the median PFS in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
group was 10.7 months compared with 3.7 months in the TPC group, HR 0.36 (0.23, 0.57), p<0.0001. 
The median OS in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group was not reached compared to 8.6 months 
in the TPC group, HR 0.37 (0.22, 0.62) p<0.0001. 
The improved ORR (per RECIST 1.1 by BICR) was observed in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group 
(40.0%) compared with 12.3% for the TPC group, with an estimated difference of 27.7% (95% CI: 12.9, 
41.7; nominal p=0.0002). 
The median DOR assessed by BICR was not reached as of the IA1 data cutoff date in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab group and was 4.1 months in the TPC group. The median TTR (per RECIST 1.1 by BICR) 
was 2.9 months in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 1.9 months in the TPC group.  
Determination of MSI/MMR status  
Available  tumour  samples  were  tested  centrally  to  determine  tumour  MSI  status.  Tumour  MSI  status 
was determined by IHC. Tumour MMR status was determined using the Ventana MMR IHC assay.  
All patients were assessed centrally for MMR status with IHC, using a clinical trial assay (CTA) of Roche 
Tissue  Diagnostics.  All  four  MMR  proteins  (MLH1,  MSH2,  MSH6  and  PMS2)  were  tested,  as  usually 
recommended.  Compared to  MSI  PCR  results,  its  precision  (repeatability  and reproducibility)  met the 
acceptance criteria.   
Additionally, if available, local testing results for both MSI and MMR status were also collected. Overall, 
MSI/MMR status was derived based on central assessment if both central and local assessments results 
were available, and then based on central MMR IHC testing if both MMR and MSI status were available. 
If central testing results were not available, then local testing results were used to derive MSI and MMR 
status. Similar to central testing, if both local MSI and MMR results were available, MMR results were 
used to derive MSI/MMR status. 
In the EC 2L+ Set, 104 of the 108 subjects submitted tumour samples (no tumour samples were obtained 
from 4 subjects). Central testing results for MMR/MSI status were available for 97 subjects (7 samples 
did not meet testing criteria). There were 86 Non-MSI-H/pMMR (45 Non-MSI-H and 41 pMMR) and 11 
MSI-H/dMMR (6 MSI-H and 5 dMMR) tumours. Among the 86 Non-MSI-H/pMMR centrally tested samples, 
12 samples were tested by both assay platforms, and the results were 100% concordant. Among the 11 
subjects whose tumor MSI/MMR status was not available by central testing, 8 subjects (7 Non-MSI-H 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021

and 1 pMMR) had local testing results available, for a total of 94 Non-MSI-H/pMMR subjects defining the 
EC 2L+ Set. For 3 subjects, there was no central or local MMR/MSI status available. 
Among the 108 subjects in the EC 2L+ Set, 62 subjects (58 Non-MSI-H/pMMR and 4 MSI˗H/dMMR) had 
MMR/MSI  local  testing  results  available  with  a  high  concordance  to  central  testing  results  (95% 
concordance,  n=59;  5%  discordance,  n=3).  Among  the  94  Non˗MSI-H/pMMR  subjects,  58  had  local 
testing results available with a high concordance to central testing results (96.6% concordance, n=56; 
3.4% discordance n=2).  
PD-L1 status was not assessed in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775.  
Supportive study 
The  results  from  an  ongoing  phase  1b/2  E7080-A001-111/KEYNOTE-146  trial  in  which  a  total  of  108 
patients received lenvatinib 20 mg QD plus pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W as the second-Line or later line 
treatment at stage II, whose results support the demonstration of the efficacy of combination treatment 
activity in advanced EC.  
Contribution of components within lenvatinib-pembrolizumab combination 
The pivotal trial did not include the monotherapy arms and no direct comparative data are available.  
Results from Study 204, KEYNOTE-158, and KEYNOTE-028 were provided in order to provide evidence 
of the contribution of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab monotherapies to the efficacy of the combination. 
KEYNOTE-158 is a phase 2 study of pembrolizumab monotherapy in participants with multiple types of 
advanced solid tumors progressing after standard of care therapy. Efficacy results for a total of 79 dMMR 
and 90 dMMR endometrial cancer patients have been provided, together with 24 subjects who received 
pembrolizumab  in  the  phase  1  study  KEYNOTE-028.  The  evidence  for  lenvatinib  monotherapy  comes 
from 133 patients treated within the phase II single arm Study-204, for whom however the MMR status 
was not determined. The dose of lenvatinib used in Study-204 (24 mg OD) was higher than what was 
used in the combination with pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-775 (20 mg OD). On the contrary, the same 
dose  of  pembrolizumab  (200  mg  Q3W)  was  used  in  KEYNOTE-775  and  -158.  When  comparing  the 
baseline characteristics of the four studies, some differences are noted, most relevant being that patients 
in KEYNOTE-775 have better performance status compared to patients enrolled in the supportive studies, 
and  that  patients  in  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  studies  KEYNOTE-158  and  -028  were  more 
pretreated. It cannot be excluded that this could have possibly improved the outcome of KEYNOTE-775 
population with respect to subjects receiving monotherapy in the supportive studies. The lack of data on 
PD-L1 expression in KEYNOTE-775 at this stage is a limit for data interpretation. The key efficacy results 
of the combination and monotherapy studies are summarized below: 
• 
The ORR for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in pMMR participants with advanced EC was higher 
relative  to  what  was  observed  for  either  lenvatinib  monotherapy  in  Study  204  or  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy  in  KEYNOTE-028  and  KEYNOTE-158.  The  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  of  the  ORR  for 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was greater than that of the observed point estimate for either lenvatinib 
or pembrolizumab administered as monotherapy. 
• 
The  observed  CR  rate  was  higher  in  participants  who  received  lenvatinib  plus pembrolizumab 
compared with those who received lenvatinib monotherapy in Study 204 or pembrolizumab monotherapy 
in KEYNOTE-158 and KEYNOTE-028. 
• 
Among  responders,  the  median  DOR  for  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  in  pMMR  participants 
with  advanced  EC  was  longer  compared  with  lenvatinib  monotherapy  in  Study  204.  The  median  DOR 
was  not  reached  for  participants  with  advanced  EC  who  received  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in 
KEYNOTE-158 and in KEYNOTE-028. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021 
Page 81/154 
 
 
 
 
• 
The median PFS for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in pMMR participants with advanced EC was 
longer relative to what was observed for either lenvatinib monotherapy in Study 204 or pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in KEYNOTE-028 and KEYNOTE-158. 
• 
As of the cut-off date, the median OS for lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in pMMR participants 
with advanced EC was longer relative to what was observed for either lenvatinib monotherapy in Study 
204 or pembrolizumab monotherapy in KEYNOTE-028 and KEYNOTE-158. 
In the pMMR subgroup, considering the ORR and PFS data reported in the supportive studies, and the 
apparent  limited  activity  of  both  pembrolizumab  and  lenvatinib  as  single  agents  in  previously  treated 
advanced/metastatic endometrial cancer with pMMR based on single-arm data, the overall results seem 
to support the hypothesis that each component is contributing to the treatment effect in the combination 
regimen. The limit of cross-study comparison should be however noted. However, the limits of cross-
study comparison hamper the possibility to draw definitive conclusions. No meaningful conclusion can 
be made with regards to OS, especially in view of some differences in baseline characteristics among 
studies, as well as the difficulties in evaluating time-related endpoints in single-arm studies.    
In  conclusion,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  combination  of  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  showed 
superiority to TPC with respect to PFS, OS and ORR for the treatment of dMMR participants in KEYNOTE-
775, although the dMMR subgroup was not formally tested. The cross-study comparison, acknowledging 
its  limitations,  suggests  that  the  activity  of  the  pembrolizumab  +  lenvatinib  combination  is  not 
significantly different as compared to pembrolizumab alone in dMMR EC population. While the lack of 
direct  comparison  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  versus  pembrolizumab  and  lenvatinib  in  2L  dMMR 
endometrial cancer is a limitation in the dossier,  this study has shown a substantial improvement in all 
efficacy endpoints for pembrolizumab and lenvatinib against chemotherapy in dMMR endometrial cancer, 
which is fully acknowledged.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 study showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful advantage in 
OS  and  PFS  of  the  combination  pembrolizumab  +  lenvatinib  as  compared  to  standard  chemotherapy 
(doxorubicin or paclitaxel, TPC) in advanced endometrial cancer patients progressed to at least one prior 
platinum-based  therapy.  Even  though  the  median  OS  improvement  was  found  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab group over TPC, OS data is not fully mature yet and this limits the efficacy estimation at 
this moment. Therefore, the MAH is recommended to submit the results from the final OS analysis in 
the overall population and by MMR biomarker (expected in Q4 2022).  
ORR  for  the  combination  was  not  outstanding  but  was  doubled  compared  to  the  standard  treatment. 
DOR, PFS2 and PFS sensitivity analyses further support the benefit of the combination. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Lenvima  (Lenvatinib,  Eisai)  is  already  commercialized  in  monotherapy  to  treat  differentiated 
(papillary/follicular/Hürthle cell) thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  
The safety profile of lenvatinib is based on data from 452 DTC patients and 496 HCC patients; allowing 
characterisation only of common adverse drug reactions in DTC and HCC patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021 
Page 82/154 
 
 
 
 
 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab, MSD) is already commercialized in monotherapy or in combination to treat 
melanoma,  Non-small  cell  lung  carcinoma  (NSCLC),  Classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma  (cHL),  Urothelial 
carcinoma,  Head  and  neck  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (HNSCC),  Renal  cell  carcinoma  (RCC),  and 
Colorectal cancer (CRC). 
Pembrolizumab  is  most  commonly  associated  with  immune-related  adverse  reactions.  Most  of  these, 
including severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of 
pembrolizumab. 
The  safety  of  pembrolizumab  as  monotherapy  has  been  evaluated  in  6,185  patients  with  advanced 
melanoma, resected Stage III melanoma (adjuvant therapy), NSCLC, cHL, urothelial carcinoma, HNSCC, 
or CRC across four doses (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 200 mg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 
weeks) in clinical studies.  
In this patient population, the median observation time was 7.6 months (range: 1 day to 47 months) 
and the most frequent adverse reactions with pembrolizumab were fatigue (32%), nausea (21%), and 
diarrhoea (21%). The majority of adverse reactions reported for monotherapy were of Grades 1 or 2 
severity.  The  most  serious  adverse  reactions  were  immune-related  adverse  reactions  and  severe 
infusion-related reactions. 
The safety profile of oral lenvatinib (E7080) 20 mg QD in combination with IV pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 
200  mg  Q3W  has  been  studied  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  EC  who  have  disease 
progression following prior platinum-based systemic therapy. 
The main safety results were provided from the pivotal, open-label, randomized Phase 3 study, Study 
309/KEYNOTE-775 (KEYNOTE775). The safety profile of the combination of lenvatinib + pembrolizumab 
is compared to Physician´s Choice (doxorubicin or paclitaxel – TPC group). 
Supportive data have been provided for comparison:  
- Data from the non-Endometrial Carcinoma (EC) participants in Study 111/KEYNOTE-146 were selected 
for the Lenvatinib in combination with Pembrolizumab Non-EC Safety Dataset. 
- Data from the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Dataset: includes all subjects who received at least one 
dose of lenvatinib in E7080-G000-398, E7080-G000-303, E7080-G000-201, E7080-G000-204, E7080-
G000-703,  E7080-G000-203,  E7080-G000-205,  E7080-G000-206,  E7080-J081-208,  E7080-G000-209 
and E7080-J081-105 (i.e. data from participants with various cancer including EC, with different data 
cut-off). 
- Data from the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Reference Safety Dataset (RSD): includes all subjects who 
received  at  least  one  dose  of  pembrolizumab  in  KEYNOTE001  Part  B1,  B2,  B3,  D,  C,  F1,  F2,  F3, 
KEYNOTE002 (original phase), KEYNOTE006, KEYNOTE010, KEYNOTE012 cohort B and B2, KEYNOTE013 
cohort  3,  KEYNOTE024,  KEYNOTE040,  KEYNOTE042,  KEYNOTE045,  KEYNOTE048,  KEYNOTE052, 
KEYNOTE054, KEYNOTE055 and KEYNOTE087 (i.e. data from participants with various cancer including 
EC, with different data cut-off). 
Analyses were conducted using the APaT population (all participants as treated) as of each study data 
cut-off (Study 309/KEYNOTE-775: 26-OCT-2020; Study 111/KEYNOTE-146: 10-JAN-2019).

Patient exposure 
•  Overall exposure 
As  of  the  26-OCT-2020  data  cut-off,  406  participants  received  at  least  1  dose  of  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab  combination,  compared  to  388  participants  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  the 
doxorubicin or paclitaxel chemotherapy in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 (EC). There were 230 participants 
in the Lenvatinib plus Pembrolizumab Non-EC Safety Dataset (KEYNOTE-146), 1,119 participants in the 
lenvatinib monotherapy safety dataset, and 5,884 participants in the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. 
The  median  duration  of  treatment  was  longer  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  (7.59 
months) compared to the TPC EC group (3.43 months), the lenvatinib monotherapy safety dataset (5.55 
months) and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (4.86 months) (table below) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021 
Page 84/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The proportion of participants with duration of treatment was higher at each time point analyzed in the 
lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  compared  to  the  TPC  EC  group,  and  higher  through  the  ≥6 
month  time  point  compared  with  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  group  and  the  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD (table below).  
The median duration of treatment in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group (7.59 months) was 
shorter compared with the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (9.79 months) (table below). 
The length of follow-up was longer for Study 111/KEYNOTE-146 than for Study 309/KEYNOTE-775. 
The median duration of lenvatinib exposure was longer in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group 
(6.95 months) compared to the lenvatinib monotherapy safety dataset (5.55 months) and shorter than 
in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (9.59 months). The median duration of treatment 
with the combination (7.59 months) is comparable to that observed for lenvatinib in the combination 
group (6.95 months) in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775.

•  Demographics and other characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 were generally well balanced 
between  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  and  the  TPC  EC  group  (Table  below).  In  the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group, all participants were female, and most were white (63.1%) or 
Asian (20.9%), with an ECOG performance status of 0 (60.1%), and a minority were based in the EU 
(28.1%). Half of them were under 65 year-of-age (yoa), and half of them over 65 yoa. 
When the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group was compared with the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
non-EC group, lenvatinib monotherapy group, and pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD, the following main 
differences were noted: 
- Male participants were included in the other groups (overall over 50%). 
-  More  participants  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  were  ≥65  years  of  age  (49.5%) 
compared with the other groups (minimum of 37.4% in lenvatinib monotherapy group). 
- Less participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group were white (63.1%) compared with 
the other groups (maximum of 87.4% in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group). 
- More participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group were Asian (20.9%) compared with 
the other groups (minimum of 1.3% in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group). 
-  More  participants  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  were  Hispanic  or  Latino  (14.8%) 
compared with the other groups (minimum of 3.8% in the lenvatinib monotherapy group). 
- More participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group had an ECOG performance status of 
0 (60.1%) compared with the other groups (minimum of 44% in lenvatinib monotherapy group). 
-  More  participants  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  were  based  in  the  EU  (28.1%) 
compared with the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (6.1%).

interruption due to AEs (50% vs. 25.4%). 
The overall AE summary profile of the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group was generally consistent 
with the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group, except for drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs, which 
was  higher  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  compared  with  the  lenvatinib  plus

Overall,  the  safety  profile  adjusted  for  exposure  of  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  in  Study 
309/KEYNOTE-775 is generally similar to the comparative safety sets of TPC EC in Study 309/KEYNOTE-
775,  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  in  non-EC  and  lenvatinib  monotherapy,  but  exposure  adjusted 
differences were generally much higher compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy (table below). 
When  comparing  the  exposure-adjusted  AE  (rate:  number  of  events  /  100  person-months),  in  the 
lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  and  the  TPC  EC  group  (table  below),  there  were  generally 
similar rate of all SAEs (10.15 vs. 10.08), drug-related SAEs (5.15 vs. 4.08), and drug-related fatal AEs 
(0.15 vs. 0.45); lower rate of drug-related AEs (133.21 vs. 153.13), Grade 3 to 5 AEs (31.02 vs. 48.78), 
drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs (18.52 vs. 34.5) and fatal AEs (0.59 vs. 1.08); and higher rate of dose 
interruption due to an AE (21.18 vs. 11.5), discontinuation due to an AEs (5 vs. 2.32), to a drug-related 
AEs  (3.98  vs.  1.76),  to  a  SAEs  (2.42  vs.  0.85),  or  to  a  drug-related  SAEs  (1.63  vs.  0.45),  dose 
modification due to an AE (37.91 vs. 18.58), and dose reduction due to an AE (15.16 vs. 4.76). 
In  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  and  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  group,  there  were 
generally similar rate of all AEs (231.94 vs. 226.7), all SAEs (10.15 vs. 9.66), dose interruption due to 
AE (21.18 vs. 22.71), drug-related fatal AEs (0.15 vs. 0.21); lower rate of drug-related AEs (133.21 vs. 
150.70), fatal AEs (0.59 vs. 0.72), and lenvatinib interruption due to AEs (15.72 vs. 22.71); and higher 
rate of drug-related SAEs (5.15 vs. 3.79), Grade 3 to 5 AEs (31.02 vs. 22.7), drug-related Grade 3 to 5 
AEs (18.52 vs. 14.12), discontinuation due to AEs (5 vs. 3.07), to a drug-related AEs (3.98 vs. 2.08), to 
a SAEs (2.42 vs. 1.51), or to a drug-related SAEs (1.63 vs. 0.84), and lenvatinib dose reduction due to 
an AE (15.16 vs. 9.3). 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD, there were 
generally similar rate of all SAEs (10.15 vs. 8.55), fatal AEs (0.59 vs. 0.67), and drug-related fatal AEs 
(0.15  vs.  0.08);  and  much  higher  rate  of  all  AEs  (231.94  vs.  128.64),  drug-related  AEs  (133.21  vs. 
40.27), Grade 3 to 5 AEs (31.02 vs. 12.87), drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs (18.52 vs 2.87), drug-related 
SAEs (5.15 vs. 1.91), dose interruption due to AE (21.18 vs. 5.59), pembrolizumab interruption due to 
AEs (11.28 vs. 5.59), and discontinuation due to AEs (5 vs. 1.8), to a drug-related AEs (3.98 vs. 0.94), 
to a SAEs (2.42 vs. 1.27), or to a drug-related SAEs (1.63 vs. 0.54). 
The overall AE summary profile of the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group was generally consistent 
with the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group, except for lower rate of dose interruption of any 
drugs due to AEs (21.18 vs. 26.74), and lenvatinib interruption due to AEs (15.72 vs. 23.33); and higher 
rate in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group compared with the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
non-EC group observed for Grade 3 to 5 AEs (31.02 vs. 25.73), drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs (18.52 
vs. 12.24), drug-related SAEs (5.15 vs. 2.85); discontinuation of due to AEs (5 vs. 3.1),  to drug-related 
AEs (3.98 vs. 1.91), to a SAEs (2.42 vs. 1.74), or to a drug-related SAEs (1.63 vs. 0.87). 
So,  overall,  Grade  3  to  5  AEs  (including  drug-related  Grade 3  to  5  AEs)  exposure-adjusted  rate  was 
higher  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  compared  with  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab 
non-EC, and both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab monotherapy datasets, but lower than in the TPC EC 
group. SAEs rates were similar between all datasets. Fatal AEs rates were similar between the lenvatinib 
plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group,  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC,  and  both  lenvatinib  and 
pembrolizumab  monotherapy  datasets,  but  lower  than  in  the  TPC  EC  group.  However,  rate  of 
discontinuation of any drugs due to AEs (including due to drug-related AEs) and to SAEs (including due 
to drug-related SAEs) was slightly higher in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group compared to 
all other datasets.

•  Most frequently reported AEs 
The overall incidence of AEs was similar between the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group (99.8%), 
TPC  EC  group  (99.5%),  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC  group  (100%),  the  lenvatinib 
monotherapy  group  (99%)  and  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD  (96.7%)  (Table  below).  The  most 
frequently reported AEs (incidence ≥30%) were:  
- Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group: hypertension, hypothyroidism, diarrhoea, nausea, decreased 
appetite, vomiting, weight decreased, fatigue, and arthralgia  
- TPC EC group: anaemia, nausea, neutropenia, and alopecia 
The most frequent exposure-adjusted AEs in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group (> 4 events / 
100  person-months)  were  diarrhoea,  hypertension,  nausea,  vomiting,  hypothyroidism,  decreased 
appetite, proteinuria, arthralgia, fatigue, and weight decreased. All these AEs are identified very common 
ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021

When comparing the exposure-adjusted AEs, the overall rate was slightly lower in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab EC group (231.94) compared to the TPC EC group (256.41) (Table below). The following 
AEs were reported with an increased rate of at least 2 events / 100 person-months in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab  EC  group  compared  to  the  TPC  EC  group  : Hypertension,  Hypothyroidism,  Diarrhoea, 
Weight  decreased,  Arthralgia,  Proteinuria,  AST  increased,  Dysphonia,  and  PPES.  All  these  AEs  are 
identified very common ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8. 
The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  were  generally 
consistent  with  those  observed  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC  group,  although  the 
incidences varied for some of these AEs between the 2 groups. 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group compared with the lenvatinib monotherapy group and 
pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD,  there  was  a  marked  higher  incidence  of  the  following  AEs: 
hypothyroidism, anaemia, UTI, ALT increased, AST increased, hypomagnesemia, hypertriglyceridemia, 
lipase  increased,  mucosal  inflammation,  hyperthyroidism,  Hypokalaemia,  Blood  thyroid  stimulating 
hormone  increased,  blood  alkaline  phosphatase  increased,  platelet  count  decreased,  blood  creatinine 
increased, hyponatremia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and neutrophil count decreased. 
Of these AEs, the following had a marked higher incidence in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group 
compared  with  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC  group:  hypothyroidism,  anaemia,  UTI,  ALT 
increased,  AST  increased,  hypomagnesemia,  mucosal  inflammation,  hyperthyroidism,  Blood  thyroid 
stimulating hormone increased, platelet count decreased, neutropenia, leukopenia, and neutrophil count 
decreased.

•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
•  Deaths due to adverse events 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in death was comparable in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC 
group (5.7% - 23 deaths), the TPC EC group (4.9% - 19 deaths), and the pembrolizumab monotherapy 
RSD (5.3% - 312 deaths), and lower than in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (10.4% – 
24 deaths) and the lenvatinib monotherapy group (8.7% - 97 deaths). 
When  comparing  the  exposure-adjusted  fatal  AEs,  the  overall  rate  was  lower  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group (0.15) compared to the TPC EC group (0.45).  
The overall incidence of drug-related AEs resulting in death was comparable in all groups: lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab  EC  group  (1.5%  -  6  deaths),  TPC  EC  group  (2.1%  -  8  deaths),  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab non-EC group (2.2% - 5 deaths), the lenvatinib monotherapy group (2.4% - 27 deaths) 
and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (0.7% - 39 deaths). 
Out  of  the  6  drug-related  fatal  AEs  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group,  1  death  due  to 
multiorgan dysfunction syndrome was considered by the investigator as related to both lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab.  One  death  each  due  to  cerebrovascular  accident,  right  ventricular  dysfunction, 
myelodysplastic syndrome, and death were considered by the investigator as related to lenvatinib, and 
1 death due to colitis was considered by the investigator as related to pembrolizumab.

•  SAEs  
The overall incidence of SAEs was similar between the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group (52.7%), 
the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (56.1%), the lenvatinib monotherapy group (54.8%), 
and higher than in the TPC EC group (30.4%) and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (38.5%) (Table 
below). The most frequently reported SAEs (incidence ≥1%) were: 
-  Lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab:  hypertension,  UTI,  diarrhoea,  decreased  appetite,  vomiting,  acute 
kidney  injury,  pyrexia,  cholecystitis,  colitis,  pneumonia,  death,  dehydration,  intestinal  obstruction, 
sepsis, abdominal pain, ileus, and pulmonary embolism 
- TPC: febrile neutropenia, anaemia, neutropenia, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis. 
The most frequent exposure-adjusted SAEs in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group (≥ 0.2 events 
/ 100 person-months) were hypertension, UTI, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, vomiting, acute kidney 
injury, pyrexia, cholecystitis, colitis and pneumonia. 
When  comparing  the  exposure-adjusted  SAEs,  the  overall  rate  was  similar  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group (10.15) compared to the TPC EC group (10.08). Exposure-adjusted rates of 
SAEs  across  the  various  SOCs  were  similar  between  the  2  groups.  Only  the  2  following  SAEs  were 
reported  with  an  increased  rate  of  at  least  0.3  events  /  100  person-months  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab  EC  group  compared  to  the  TPC  EC  group:  hypertension  and  UTI.  These  2  SAEs  are 
identified very common ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8. 
There  was  a  marked  higher  incidence  of  the  following  SAEs  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC 
group  (incidence  ≥ 2%)  compared  with  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  group  and  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD: UTI and Diarrhoea. Of these SAEs, only UTI had a marked higher incidence in the 
lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  compared  with  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC 
group.

The overall incidence of drug-related SAEs was similar between the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC 
group (33.3%), the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (25.7%), the lenvatinib monotherapy 
group (29.5%), and higher than in the TPC EC group (14.2%) and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD 
(11.1%) (Table below). The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs (incidence ≥1%) were:

- TPC group: febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, and anaemia. 
- Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group: hypertension, colitis, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, 
pyrexia, and acute kidney injury. All these drug-related SAEs were more frequent with in the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab EC group compared to the TPC EC group. 
When comparing the exposure-adjusted drug-related SAEs, the overall rate was similar in the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab EC group (5.15) compared to the TPC EC group (4.08). The details by drug-related 
SAEs were not provided. 
Only the drug-related SAE pyrexia was reported with a marked higher incidence in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab  EC  group  (incidence  ≥ 1%)  compared  with  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  group, 
pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD, and the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group.

•  Adverse Events of Special Interest for lenvatinib  
As  expected,  the  incidence  of  Clinically  Significant  Adverse  Events  associated  with  Lenvatinib  (CSAE) 
was  higher  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  (94.8%)  compared  with  the  TPC  group 
(37.6%). 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group, the incidence of all reported CSAE, serious CSAE, Grade 
3 to 5 CSAE, and CSAE leading to dose interruptions of any drug were generally consistent with those 
observed in the lenvatinib monotherapy and the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC groups. 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group, the incidences of all reported drug-related CSAE, drug-
related serious CSAE, drug-related Grade 3 to 5 CSAE, dose reduction of lenvatinib due to an AE, and 
discontinuations of any drug due to CSAE were slightly higher than in the lenvatinib monotherapy and 
the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC groups. 
In  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group,  most  CSAE  were  ≤Grade  3  (approximately  95%). 
Approximately 60% of CSAE were not resolved at the time of data cut-off; this was largely driven by 
hypothyroidism. The majority of the other CSAE were resolved or resolving at the time of the data cut-
off. 
The  most  common  CSAE  observed  (incidence  ≥  15%)  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group 
were hypertension (64%), hypothyroidism (57.4%), proteinuria (28.8%), PPES (21.2%), ALT increased 
(21.2%), and AST increased (19.7%). 
The frequencies of CSAE in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group were generally consistent with 
those  in  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  group,  with  the  exception  of  the  CSAE  events  of  hepatotoxicity 
Assessment report

(mainly ALT and AST increased, Grade 1 to 3), hypothyroidism (Grade 1 to 2), and renal events (mainly 
Blood creatinine increased, Grade 1 to 2) which were more reported with the combination.  
All these CSAE are identified very common ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8. 
ALT  and  AST  increased  and  hypothyroidism  were  also  more  frequent  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group compared to the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (although the 
difference was less marked). 
Eight  participants  (2.0%)  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  died  due  to  CSAE:  arterial 
thromboembolic  events  [acute  myocardial  infarction,  cerebral  vascular  accident],  cardiac  dysfunction 
[right  ventricular  dysfunction],  GI  perforation  [intestinal  perforation,  large  intestine  perforation], 
haemorrhage  [lower  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage,  vaginal  haemorrhage],  and  renal  events  [acute 
kidney injury]. Two of these deaths (cerebrovascular accident and right ventricular dysfunction) were 
considered by the investigator to be related to lenvatinib.

•  Adverse Events of Special Interest for Pembrolizumab (AEOSI) 
Adverse Events of Special Interest for Pembrolizumab (AEOSI) are immune-mediated events and IRRs 
associated with pembrolizumab treatment. 
Assessment report

As expected, the incidence of AEOSI was higher in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group (67.2%) 
compared with the TPC group (4.4%) (Table below). 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group, the incidence of all reported AEOSI, and drug-related 
AEOSI were generally slightly higher than those observed in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC 
group, and much higher than those observed in the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD group. 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group, the incidence of serious AEOSI and drug-related serious 
AEOSI were slightly higher compared to the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC and pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD groups. 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group, the incidence of Grade 3 to 5 AEOSI, drug-related Grade 
3 to 5 AEOSI, AEOSI leading to dose interruptions of any drug, and discontinuation of any drug due to 
an  AEOSI,  were  generally  similar  than  those  observed  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC 
group, but higher than those observed in the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD group. 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group, most AEOSI were ≤Grade 2 (approximately 81%). Most 
Grade 3 to 4 AEOSI were reported in ≤1% of participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group, 
except for Grade 3 severe skin reactions (2.5%), Grade 3 colitis (1.5%), and Grade 3 hepatitis (1.5%). 
Approximately 60% of AEOSI were not resolved at the time of data cut-off; this was largely driven by 
hypothyroidism. The majority of the other AEOSI were resolved or resolving at the time of the data cut-
off. 
The most common AEOSI observed (incidence ≥ 10%) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group 
were hypothyroidism (57.4%) and hyperthyroidism (11.6%). 
The frequencies of AEOSI in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group were generally consistent with 
those in the lenvatinib monotherapy group, with the exception of the AEOSI events of hypothyroidism 
(Grade 1 to 2), hyperthyroidism (Grade 1 to 3) and colitis (Grade 1 to 3) which were more reported with 
the combination.  
Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were also more frequent in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC 
group compared to the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (although the difference was less 
marked for hypothyroidism). 
There was 1 death in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group due to an AEOSI of colitis, which 
was considered by the investigator to be related to pembrolizumab. One participant died of 
autoimmune encephalitis; however, as the death was beyond the 120-day post-treatment AE collection 
period it was not captured as a fatal event in tables or listings.

•  Laboratory findings 
Laboratory abnormalities of all grades with an incidence of ≥20% in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
EC group over the TPC group included: alkaline phosphatase increased, ALT increased, AST increased, 
cholesterol  increased,  lipase  increased,  magnesium  decreased,  platelets  decreased,  and  triglycerides 
increased.  Among  these  abnormalities,  the  largest  clinically  relevant  difference  between  treatment 
groups was in laboratory parameters known to be associated with lenvatinib: ALT increased (lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab 53.4% vs TPC 20.7%) and AST increased (lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 58.3% 
vs TPC 22.4%). The incidence of postbaseline Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab EC group was similar to that of the TPC group. 
Overall, the most frequently reported (≥30%) laboratory abnormalities (Grades 1 to 4) were similar in 
the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  and  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  group,  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD, and lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group, and the majority were Grade 1 to 
2  toxicity:  ALT  increased,  AST  increased,  Albumin  Decreased,  Alkaline  Phosphatase  Increased, 
Cholesterol  Increased,  Creatinine  Increased,  Haemoglobin  Decreased,  Lymphocytes  Decreased, 
Magnesium Decreased, Potassium Decreased, Sodium Decreased and Triglycerides Increased. However, 
calcium Decreased, Leukocytes Decreased, Neutrophils Decreased, and Platelet count decreased (Grades 
1 to 4) were more frequently reported with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group than in the other 
groups (around double incidence). And glucose Increased was more frequently reported with lenvatinib 
plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  (57.1%)  compared  to  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC  group 
(9.8%), but similarly to the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD group (around 50.8%).  
The  percentages  of  participants  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  with  Grade  3  to  4 
laboratory abnormalities were low and were generally consistent with the lenvatinib monotherapy group, 
pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD,  and  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC  group.  The  most 
frequently  reported  (incidence  ≥ 5%)  Grade  3  to  4  laboratory  abnormalities  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group were: Lymphocyte decreased (16.9%), sodium decreased (14.4%), potassium 
decreased  (10.7%),  AST  increased  (8.5%),  haemoglobin  decreased  (8.2%),  phosphate  decreased 
(8.2%),  glucose  increased  (8.0%),  ALT  increased  (7.7%),  platelets  decreased  (7.2%),  triglycerides 
increased (7.1%), magnesium decreased (6.9%), amylase increased (6.8%), and neutrophils decreased 
(5.9%). 
Three  participants  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  met  the  prespecified  drug-induced 
liver injury criteria of increase in ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN and bilirubin ≥1.5 × ULN and alkaline phosphatase 
<2 × ULN. 
•  Safety in special populations 
•  MMR status 
•  Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 
Per the study protocol in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775, the safety was assessed separately depending on 
the tumor mismatch repair (MMR) status. In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group and the TPC 
groups,  there  were  fewer  dMMR  participants  (n=64  and  63,  respectively)  as  compared  with  pMMR 
participants (n=342 and 325). 
Exposure by MMR status 
There  was  a  longer  duration  of  exposure  to  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  observed  for  dMMR 
participants (median: 335.5 days; range: 1 to 720 days) compared with pMMR participants (median: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021

219.5 days; range: 1 to 817 days). On the contrary, there was a shorter duration of exposure to TPC 
observed  for  dMMR  participants  (median:  86  days;  range:  1  to  331  days)  compared  with  pMMR 
participants (median: 106 days; range: 1 to 785 days). 
Brief Summary of Adverse Events by MMR Status 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  pMMR  and  dMMR  participants  was  similar  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab and TPC groups (Table below), and was similar to that of the all-comer population.  
Similar to the results of the all-comer population, in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group, the pMMR 
and dMMR participants had a higher frequency of Grade 3 to 5 AEs, drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs, SAEs, 
drug-related SAEs, treatment discontinuation due to AE, and treatment interruption due to AEs compared 
with each TPC group. The incidence of drug-related deaths was similar in the 2 groups. 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group, there was a higher incidence of some AE categories (ie, 
Grade 3 to 5 AEs, drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs, SAEs, dose modifications due to AEs, discontinuation 
due  to  AEs,  fatal  AEs,  fatal  drug-related  AEs)  in  the  dMMR  participants  compared  with  the  pMMR 
participants.

(APaT Population)  
When adjusted for exposure, in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group, the overall toxicity profile 
was  slightly  worst  for  the  pMMR  group  compared  to  the  dMMR  group  with  higher  incidences  of  AEs 
(237.35  vs  208.93),  drug-related  AEs  (138.43  vs  110.97),  dose  modification  due  to  an  AE  (39.35  vs

comer population: 
- Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab: hypertension, hypothyroidism, diarrhoea, nausea, decreased appetite, 
vomiting, weight decreased, fatigue, and arthralgia 
- TPC: anaemia, nausea, neutropenia, and alopecia  
Similar results were observed in the dMMR participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group but 
with anaemia also occurring at an incidence ≥30% (35.9%), and arthralgia occurring at an incidence ≤
30% (25%). Similar results were observed in the dMMR participants in the TPC group but with alopecia 
occurring at an incidence ≤30% (22.2%).

Among pMMR participants, the incidence of fatal AEs in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group was 
low (4.7% including 4 drug-related fatal AE - 1.2%) and was similar compared with the TPC group (4.6% 
including 6 drug-related fatal AEs - 1.8%), and similar to the results of the all-comer population (5.7% 
including 6 drug-related fatal AEs - 1.5%; and 4.9% including 8 fatal AEs - 2.1%, respectively). 
The  incidence  of  AEs  resulting  in  death  for  dMMR  participants  was  higher  compared  to  the  pMMR 
participants and to the all-comer population: 10.9% in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (including 2 
drug-related fatal AEs - 3.1%) and 6.3% in the TPC group (including 2 drug-related fatal AEs - 3.2%). 
Drug-related AEs resulting in death are further discussed below.  
Other Serious Adverse Events by MMR Status 
Among pMMR participants, the incidence of SAEs in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (49.7%) 
was higher compared with the TPC group (28.9%) and similar to the incidence of SAEs for the all-comer 
population (52.7% lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab; 30.4% TPC). 
The most frequently reported SAEs (incidence ≥1%) for the pMMR participants were generally similar to 
the all-comer population, with the removal of sepsis, cholecystitis, pneumonia, death, and abdominal 
pain for the Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group, and with the removal of sepsis in the TPC group: 
-  Lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab:  hypertension,  UTI,  diarrhoea,  decreased  appetite,  vomiting,  acute 
kidney injury, pyrexia, colitis, dehydration, intestinal obstruction, ileus, and pulmonary embolism

all-comer population: 68.8% in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 38.1% in the TPC group. 
For the dMMR participants, the most frequently reported SAE (incidence ≥3%) were the following: 
-  Lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab:  hypertension,  UTI,  diarrhoea,  decreased  appetite,  vomiting, 
cholecystitis, pneumonia, death, sepsis, constipation, Female genital tract fistula, nausea, and Peritonitis 
- TPC: febrile neutropenia, anaemia, and sepsis 
Adverse Events of Special Interest and Clinically Significant Adverse Events 
Clinically Significant Adverse Events by MMR Status – Lenvatinib 
The incidence of pMMR participants with CSAE in each AE category was consistent with that of the all-
comer population. As expected, incidence of pMMR participants with CSAE was higher in the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab group (94.7%) compared with the TPC group (39.1%), and similar to the all-comer 
population (94.8% lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab; 37.6% TPC). 
The most common CSAE (≥10%) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group were generally similar to 
those  for  the  all-comer  population:  hypertension  (65.5%),  hypothyroidism  (55.3%),  proteinuria 
(28.9%),  PPES  (21.9%),  ALT  increased  (21.6%),  AST  increased  (21.1%),  blood  thyroid  stimulating 
hormone increased (12.3%), and blood creatinine increased (10.5%). 
The results were similar in the dMMR participants. Incidence of dMMR participants with CSAE was higher 
in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (95.3%) compared with the TPC group (30.2%) with the 
same most common CSAE (≥10%) observed in the pMMR participants.

The incidence of pMMR participants with AEOSI in each AE category was consistent with that of the all-
comer population. As expected, incidence of pMMR participants with AEOSI was higher in the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab group (66.1%) compared with the TPC group (4.9%), and similar to the all-comer 
population (67.2% lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab; 4.4% TPC). 
The most common AEOSI (≥5%) in pMMR participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group were 
consistent  with  those  for  the  all-comer  population:  hypothyroidism  (55.3%)  and  hyperthyroidism 
(10.8%).  
The results were similar in the dMMR participants. Incidence of dMMR participants with AEOSI was higher 
in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (73.4%) compared with the TPC group (1.6%) with the same 
most common AEOSI (≥5%) observed in the pMMR participants. 
When adjusted for exposure, in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group, the observed event rates of 
AEOSI for dMMR participants were generally similar to the observed event rates for pMMR participants 
in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group.  
Discontinuation, Interruption and Dose Reduction Due to Adverse Events by MMR Status 
Adverse Events Resulting in Treatment Discontinuation by MMR Status 
The  incidence  of  pMMR  participants  with  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  both  lenvatinib  and 
pembrolizumab (12.6%) was similar to the results in the all-comers population (14.0%). The incidence 
of  participants  with  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  lenvatinib  (28.4%)  was  higher  than  for 
pembrolizumab (17.5%), similar to the results in the all-comers population (30.8% lenvatinib; 18.7% 
pembrolizumab). 
In  dMMR  participants,  there  were  an  increased  incidence  of  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  both 
lenvatinib and pembrolizumab (21.9%), lenvatinib (43.8%), and pembrolizumab (25.0%). 
Hypertension, decreased appetite, asthenia, diarrhoea, proteinuria, and vomiting resulted in lenvatinib 
discontinuation  in  ≥ 1%  of  the  pMMR  participants.  Only  ALT  increased  resulted  in  pembrolizumab 
discontinuation in ≥1% of the pMMR participants. No AEs resulted in discontinuation of both lenvatinib 
and pembrolizumab in ≥1% of the pMMR participants. 
Weight decrease, death, decreased appetite, and peritonitis resulted in lenvatinib discontinuation in ≥
3%  of  the  dMMR  participants.  Only  death  resulted  in  pembrolizumab  discontinuation  and  in 
discontinuation of both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in ≥3% of the dMMR participants  
The incidence of pMMR participants with drug-related AEs that led to discontinuation of both lenvatinib 
and pembrolizumab (4.7%) was similar to the results in the all-comers population (4.9%). The incidence 
of participants with drug-related AEs that led to discontinuation of lenvatinib (21.3%) was higher than 
for pembrolizumab (9.6%), similar to the results in the all-comers population (22.7% lenvatinib; 9.9% 
pembrolizumab). 
In dMMR participants, there were an increased incidence of drug-related AEs that led to discontinuation 
of both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab (6.3%), lenvatinib (29.7%), and pembrolizumab (10.9%). 
Only hypertension resulted in lenvatinib discontinuation in ≥2% of the pMMR participants. No AEs resulted 
in  discontinuation  of  pembrolizumab  or  both  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab  in  ≥ 2%  of  the  pMMR 
participant.

Only weight decreased and decreased appetite resulted in lenvatinib discontinuation in ≥2% of the dMMR 
participants. No AEs resulted in discontinuation of pembrolizumab or both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab 
in ≥2% of the dMMR participants.  
Interruptions Due to Adverse Events by MMR Status 
The  incidence  of  pMMR  participants  with  AEs  that  led  to  interruption  of  both  lenvatinib  and 
pembrolizumab (29.2%) was similar to the results in the all-comers population (30.8%). The incidence 
of  pMMR  participants  with  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  lenvatinib  (58.2%)  was  higher  than  for 
pembrolizumab (48.2%), similar to the results in the all-comers population (58.6% lenvatinib; 50.0% 
pembrolizumab). 
The  dMMR  participants  had  a  higher  incidence  of  AEs  that  led  to  interruption  of  both  lenvatinib  and 
pembrolizumab (39.1%), lenvatinib (60.9%), and pembrolizumab (59.4%). 
Diarrhoea, hypertension, proteinuria, decreased appetite, and vomiting resulted in lenvatinib interruption 
in  ≥ 5%  of  the  pMMR  participants.  Only  diarrhoea  resulted  in  pembrolizumab  interruption  and  in 
interruption of both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in ≥5% of the pMMR participants. 
Diarrhoea, hypertension, fatigue, and vomiting resulted in lenvatinib interruption in ≥5% of the dMMR 
participants. Only diarrhoea resulted in pembrolizumab interruption in ≥5% of the dMMR participants. No 
AE lead to interruption of both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in ≥5% of the dMMR participants. 
Dose Reductions Due to Adverse Events by MMR Status 
The incidence of pMMR participants with AEs that led to dose reduction of lenvatinib (67%) was similar 
to the incidence in the dMMR participants (64.1%) and to the results in the all-comer population (66.5%).  
Diarrhoea  and  hypertension  resulted  in  lenvatinib  reduction  in  ≥ 10%  of  the  pMMR  participants. 
Proteinuria and hypertension resulted in lenvatinib reduction in ≥10% of the dMMR participants. 
Study KEYNOTE-158 
AE  summary  and  the  AEOSI  (Adverse  Events  of  Special  Interest  for  Pembrolizumab)  summary  were 
provided separately for non-MSI-H/pMMR and MSI-H/dMMR participants (in percentage and exposure-
adjusted) for study KEYNOTE-158.  
The median duration of exposure to pembrolizumab was more than double for those in the MSI-H/dMMR 
group compared with the non-MSI-H/pMMR group (9.3 months vs 3.42 months). 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  participants  in  both  groups  was  similar.  The  safety  was  generally 
consistent between the MSI-H and non-MSI-H groups except for a higher incidence of drug-related AEs 
in the MSI-H group (75.6% vs 63.3%) and of fatal AEs (3.3% vs 0%) (table below).  
However, when adjusted for exposure, the overall toxicity profile was worst for the non-MSI-H/pMMR 
group  compared  to  the  MSI-H/dMMR  group  with  higher  incidences  of  AEs  (142.73  vs  104.11),  drug-
related AEs (37.46 vs 30.46), Grade 3 to 5 AEs (19.88 vs 9.74), SAEs (11.36 vs 5.21), and of fatal AEs 
(0.53 vs 0) (table below). 
For AEOSI, overall, the incidence of the Grade 3 to 5 AEs, dose modifications and deaths due to an AE, 
including drug-related AEs were similar between the 2 groups. However, a lower incidence was observed 
in the non-MSI-H/pMMR group compared with the MSI-H/dMMR group for the AEOSI (17.8% vs 27.8%), 
drug-related  AEOSI  (15.6%  vs  25.6%)  and  SAEs  (2.2%  vs  4.4%).  When  adjusted  for  exposure,  the 
incidence of Grade 3 to 5 AEOSI was higher in the non-MSI-H/pMMR group (1.24 vs 0.58) otherwise the 
safety was consistent between groups.

Intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
Age 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775, the AE profile was generally 
similar for participants <65 and ≥65 year-of-age (table below). However, the incidence of interruption of 
lenvatinib due to an AE, discontinuation of lenvatinib due to an AE or a drug-related AE, were higher in 
the older participants. 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group in KEYNOTE-146, the incidence of most categories 
were  higher  in  the  older  participants:  SAEs  (all  and  drug-related),  interruption  (of  pembrolizumab  or 
lenvatinib or both) due to AE, fatal AEs and drug-related fatal AEs, discontinuation (of pembrolizumab 
or lenvatinib or both) due to AE or SAE.  
In the lenvatinib monotherapy safety dataset, the incidence of most categories were also higher in the 
older  participants:  grade  3-5  (all  and  drug-related),  SAEs  (all  and  drug-related),  interruption  of 
lenvatinib due to AE, and discontinuation of lenvatinib due to AE or SAE. 
In the pembrolizumab monotherapy safety dataset, the incidence of most categories were also higher in 
the older participants: grade 3-5 AEs (all and drug-related), SAEs (all and drug-related), interruption of 
pembrolizumab due to AE, and discontinuation of pembrolizumab due to AE or SAE. 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775, the AE profile was generally 
similar for participants <65, 65-74 years, and ≥75 years. More participants in the ≥75 years of age group 
experienced  drug-related  SAEs,  deaths,  and  discontinuation  of  lenvatinib,  which  was  similar  to  the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group and lenvatinib monotherapy group. 
In  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  in  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775,  central  nervous  system 
(confusion  /  extrapyramidal)  AEs,  AEs  related  to  falling,  cardiovascular  events,  and  infections  were 
generally  similar  amongst  the  <65,  65-74,  and  ≥75  age  groups.  However,  cerebrovascular  events 
increased considerably with age: <65 (2%), 65-74 (3.6%), and >75 (11.4%). 
With regards AEs by grade and by age categories (<65, 65-74, and ≥75 age groups) for the 2 groups in 
Study  309/KEYNOTE-775,  the  most  frequent  AEs  in  the  Lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  in  the 
oldest age group were (≥ 30% and with higher frequency in oldest group): anaemia (all grade: 27.3%, 
22.9%, 34.3%; respectively), UTI (all grade: 22.0%, 28.3%, 34.4%), and hypertension (≥ Grade 3: 
33.2%, 42.2%, 45.7%). The SmPC section 4.8 (special populations) has been adapted accordingly (for 
UTI and ≥ Grade 3 hypertension). 
However, conclusions are limited due to the small number of participants in the ≥75 years of age 
group (i.e. 35 in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775).

The AE summary was provided by age categories (i.e. <75 and ≥75 years) for the following datasets: 
Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  and  the  TPC  EC  group;  Study 
309/KEYNOTE-775  +  KEYNOTE-146  +  KEYNOTE-581  Lenvatinib  +  Pembrolizumab  across  indications; 
Lenvatinib  monotherapy  safety  dataset;  and  Pembrolizumab  Monotherapy  RSD.  As  there  is  a  limited 
number of participants ≥75 years of age in the pembrolizumab + lenvatinib group (n=35) and TPC group 
(n=39)  from  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  and  the  pooled  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  +  KEYNOTE-146  + 
KEYNOTE-581 pembrolizumab + lenvatinib group (n=115), the data should be interpreted with caution.

The  observed  incidence  rates  of  the  AE  categories  of  the  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  pembrolizumab  + 
lenvatinib  group  were  generally  similar  in  the  <75  and  ≥75  age  groups,  however  higher  rate  were 
observed  for  the  elderly  for:  drug-related  SAEs,  deaths,  deaths  due  to  a  drug-related  AE,  and 
discontinuations  due  to  AE.  However,  as  a  similar  pattern  was  generally  observed  between  the  age 
groups in all datasets, this does not suggest a new safety concern for pembrolizumab + lenvatinib across 
age groups.  
Of note, the 6 fatal events observed in the participants ≥75 years of age were: 2 “death”, 1 urosepsis, 
1 myelodysplatic syndrome, 1 cerebrovascular event and 1 assisted suicide. 
Sex 
All  participants  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  were  female.  The  AE  profile  based  on 
gender in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group was generally consistent with the safety profiles

ECOG performance status 
In  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  in  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775,  there  were  60.1%  of 
participants with ECOG of 0 and 39.9% participants with ECOG of 1. 
In  each  group  (lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  in  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775,  lenvatinib 
monotherapy  safety  data  set,  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD,  and  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab 
non-EC group in KEYNOTE-146), the safety profiles were in generally consistent between participants 
with ECOG of 0 or 1. However, the incidence of SAEs, fatal AEs, and drug-related fatal AEs were increased 
in the participants with ECOG of 1. 
Geographical region 
In  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  in  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775,  there  were  28.1%  of 
participants from EU regions and 71.9% participants not from EU regions. 
In  each  group  (lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  in  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775,  lenvatinib 
monotherapy  safety  data  set,  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD,  and  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab 
non-EC group in KEYNOTE-146), the safety profiles were in generally consistent between participants 
from EU or not. However, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group and lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
non-EC group presented higher incidence of dose reduction of lenvatinib due to AEs in the participants 
not from EU (difference not observed in the lenvatinib monotherapy group). 
Ethnicity 
Frequencies of AEs by grade and by ethnicity for the 2 groups in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 were provided. 
There  was  a  limited  number  of  participants  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  and  TPC  treatment 
groups  who  were  Asian  (n=85  and  n=86,  respectively)  or  from  other  ethnicity  (n=29  and  n=34, 
respectively); therefore, the data should be interpreted with caution. 
The incidences and severity of the most frequently reported AEs (incidence ≥15%) in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab  group  were  generally  similar  between  the  different  categories  with  the  following 
differences (≥10% difference) noted:  
-  AEs  higher  in  Whites  than  Asians:  mucosal  inflammation  (14.1%  vs  1.2%),  abdominal  pain 
(23.0%  vs  8.2%),  UTI  (29.7%  vs  12.9%),  diarrhoea  (57.4%  vs  47.1%;  Grade  ≥3:  7.4%  vs 
10.6%), weight decreased (37.1% vs 27.1%), hypomagnesaemia (21.5% vs 4.7%), dizziness 
(13.7% vs 1.2%), asthenia (27.3% vs 3.5%; Grade ≥3: 7.4% vs 0%), and fatigue (39.1% vs 
17.6%)  
-  AEs  higher  in  Asians  than  Whites:  anaemia  (34.1%  vs  23.4%;  Grade  ≥3:  10.6  %  vs  4.3%), 
malaise (23.5% vs 0.8%), oedema (12.9% vs 2.3%), neutrophil count decrease (16.5% vs 2%; 
Grade ≥3: 9.4% vs 0.4%), stomatitis (37.6% vs 14.1%), platelet count decreased (32.9% vs 
7.0%, Grade ≥3: 10.6% vs 0.8%), proteinuria (51.8% vs 22.3%; Grade ≥3: 10.6% vs 3.9%), 
PPE (40.0% vs 13.3%; Grade ≥3: 5.9% vs 2.0%), and pyrexia (31.8% vs 10.5%)

•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food 
and  DDI  are  not  anticipated  to  influence  exposure.  Drugs  that  affect  the  CYP  enzymes,  and  other 
metabolizing enzymes, are not expected to interfere with the metabolism of an IgG antibody. The IgG 
antibodies,  in  general,  do  not  directly  regulate  the  expression  of  CYP  enzymes,  other  enzymes,  or 
transporters involved in drug elimination. Therefore, no dedicated DDI studies have been performed. In 
addition,  in  vitro  experiments  and  studies  conducted  in  preclinical  species  have  been  shown  to  have 
limited  value  in  predicting  DDI  potential  in  humans  [Ref.  5.4:  03JJPS].  Therefore,  no  preclinical  PK 
studies were conducted to assess the propensity of pembrolizumab to be a victim or perpetrator of PK 
DDIs. 
The main metabolic pathways for lenvatinib in humans were identified as enzymatic (CYP3A and aldehyde 
oxidase) and non-enzymatic processes. The IC50 values for the 9 main CYP isoforms, the 5 main UGT 
isoforms,  AO,  and  the  11  transporters  tested  were  more  than  4  μM,  suggesting  lenvatinib  is  not  a 
perpetrator of DDI at the maximum dose of 24 mg QD. Lenvatinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP but 
was not a substrate any of the other transporters evaluated. No formal PK drug interaction studies have 
been conducted with pembrolizumab. Since pembrolizumab is a mAb; PK interactions with lenvatinib are 
not expected. 
Studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with pembrolizumab have not been conducted. 
However,  as  systemic  corticosteroids  may  be  used  in  combination  with  pembrolizumab  to  ameliorate 
potential  side  effects,  the  potential  for  a  pharmacokinetic  DDI  with  pembrolizumab  as  a  victim  was 
assessed  as  part  of  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis.  No  relationship  was  observed  between 
prolonged  use  of  systemic  corticosteroids  and  pembrolizumab  exposure.  Nevertheless,  the  use  of 
systemic  corticosteroids  or  other  immunosuppressants  before  the  start  of  pembrolizumab  treatment 
should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy 
of pembrolizumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after 
starting pembrolizumab treatment to treat immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
The incidence of participants with AEs that led to discontinuation of any study intervention was higher 
in the lenvatinib and pembrolizumab EC group (33%) compared with the TPC group (8%). The incidence 
of participants with AEs that led to discontinuation of both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab was 14.0%, 
with discontinuation of lenvatinib (30.8%) higher than for pembrolizumab (18.7%). 
The  incidence  of  AEs  resulting  in  lenvatinib  discontinuation  was  generally  consistent  between  the 
lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  (30.8%)  and  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  group  (26.7%). 
Hypertension,  decreased  appetite,  asthenia,  weight  decreased,  diarrhoea,  proteinuria,  intestinal 
obstruction, and vomiting resulted in lenvatinib discontinuation in ≥1% of participants in the lenvatinib 
plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group.  Hypertension,  asthenia,  proteinuria,  and  fatigue  resulted  in  lenvatinib 
discontinuation in ≥1% of participants in the lenvatinib monotherapy group. 
The  incidence  of  AEs  resulting  in  pembrolizumab  discontinuation  was  similar  for  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group (18.7%) compared to the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD group (13.4%).

of participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group. No individual AEs in the pembrolizumab 
monotherapy group resulted in pembrolizumab discontinuation in >1% of participants. 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  resulting  in  discontinuation  of  both  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab  was 
consistent  between  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  (14.0%)  and  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab  non-EC  group  (18.3%).  Intestinal  obstruction  was  the  only  AE  resulting  in 
discontinuation  of  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab  with  an  incidence  of  ≥ 1%  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab  EC  group;  no  individual  AEs  ≥ 1%  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  lenvatinib  and 
pembrolizumab in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group. 
From all these AEs resulting in discontinuation of lenvatinib, pembrolizumab, or both in the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab EC group, only intestinal obstruction is not an identified ADR in the SmPC. 
Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
The incidence of participants with drug-related AEs that led to discontinuation of any study intervention 
was higher in the lenvatinib and pembrolizumab EC group (26.6%) compared with the TPC group (5.7%). 
The  incidence  of  participants  with  drug-related  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  both  lenvatinib  and 
pembrolizumab  was  4.9%,  with  discontinuation  of  lenvatinib  (22.7%)  higher than  for  pembrolizumab 
(9.9%). 
The  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  resulting  in  lenvatinib  discontinuation  was  generally  consistent 
between the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group (22.7%) and the lenvatinib monotherapy group

discontinuation  (regardless  of  action  taken  for  pembrolizumab)  in  ≥ 1%  of  participants  included 
hypertension,  asthenia,  weight  decreased,  decreased  appetite,  proteinuria,  diarrhoea,  and  vomiting. 
Hypertension,  asthenia,  proteinuria,  and  fatigue  resulted  in  lenvatinib  discontinuation  in  ≥ 1%  of 
participants in the lenvatinib monotherapy group. 
The  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  resulting  in  pembrolizumab  discontinuation  was  similar  for  the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group (9.9%) and the pembrolizumab monotherapy group (7.0%). 
ALT increased was the only drug-related AE in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group resulting in 
pembrolizumab  discontinuation  in  ≥ 1%  of  participants.  No  individual  AEs  in  the  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy group resulted in pembrolizumab discontinuation in >1% of participants.

The incidence of AEs resulting in lenvatinib interruption was similar in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
EC  group  (58.6%)  and  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  group  (67.6%).  AEs  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab  EC  group  resulting  in  lenvatinib  discontinuation  in  ≥ 5%  of  participants  included 
hypertension, diarrhoea, proteinuria, and vomiting. Hypertension, diarrhoea, proteinuria, and vomiting, 
nausea,  asthenia,  fatigue,  PPES  and  decreased  appetite  resulted  in  lenvatinib  interruption  in  ≥5%  of 
participants in the lenvatinib monotherapy group. 
The  incidence  of  AEs  resulting  in  pembrolizumab  interruption  was  higher  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab group (50.0%) than in the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD group (25.4%). Diarrhoea 
was the only AE in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group resulting in pembrolizumab discontinuation 
in  ≥ 5%  of  participants.  No  individual  AEs  in  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  group  resulted  in 
pembrolizumab interruption in >5% of participants. 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in interruption of both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab was similar 
in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  (30.8%)  and  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC 
group  (38.7%).  In  the  Lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group,  the  most  common  AEs  resulting  in 
treatment  interruption  of  both  drugs  (>1%)  were:  diarrhoea,  ALT  increased,  AST  increased,  UTI, 
hypertension,  cholecystitis,  blood  creatinine  increased,  hyperthyroidism,  and  vomiting.  Diarrhoea, 
colitis,  nausea,  fatigue,  pneumonia,  URTI,  Decreased  appetite,  Dehydration,  Arthralgia,  Acute  kidney 
injury,  Proteinuria,  Dyspnoea,  and  Pleural  effusion  resulted  in  interruption  of  both  lenvatinib  and 
pembrolizumab in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group. 
Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Treatment interruption 
The  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  resulting  in  lenvatinib  interruption  was  lower  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group (45.8%) than in the lenvatinib monotherapy group (61.3%). Drug-related AEs 
in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group resulting in lenvatinib interruption in ≥2% of participants 
included hypertension, diarrhoea, proteinuria, decreased appetite, vomiting, fatigue, nausea, and weight 
decreased  [Table  5.3.5.3.3-endometrial1:  34].  The  same  drug-related  AES  plus  abdominal  pain, 
abdominal pain upper, stomatitis, and asthenia resulted in lenvatinib interruption in ≥2% of participants 
in the lenvatinib monotherapy group. 
The  incidence  of  AEs  resulting  in  pembrolizumab  interruption  was  higher  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group (25.6%) than in the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD group (14.2%). Drug-
related AEs in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group resulting in pembrolizumab interruption in ≥
2%  of  participants  included  diarrhoea  and  ALT  increased  [Table  5.3.5.3.3-endometrial1:  35].  No 
individual AEs in the pembrolizumab monotherapy group resulted in pembrolizumab interruption in >5% 
of participants. 
•  Adverse Events Leading to dose reduction of lenvatinib 
Adverse Events Leading to dose reduction of lenvatinib  
In Study 309/KEYNOTE-775, the pembrolizumab dose was fixed at 200 mg Q3W and dose reduction was 
not allowed. 
The starting dose for lenvatinib was 20 mg QD, however dose modifications were allowed according to 
the  approved  label  and  standard  practice.  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  resulting  in  dose  reduction  of 
lenvatinib  was  higher  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  (66.5%)  than  in  the  lenvatinib 
monotherapy group (47.5%). 
Assessment report

In  the  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab  EC  group,  the  AEs  that  most  frequently  led  to  lenvatinib  dose 
reduction (incidence >5%) were hypertension, diarrhoea, PPES, proteinuria, decreased appetite, fatigue, 
and weight decreased, all of which are known to be associated with lenvatinib. From those, hypertension, 
diarrhoea, proteinuria, decreased appetite, and fatigue, resulted in lenvatinib dose reduction in >5% of 
participants in the lenvatinib monotherapy group. All these AEs resulting in dose reduction of lenvatinib 
in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group are identified ADRs in the SmPC. 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  resulting  in  a  dose  reduction  of  lenvatinib  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group (66.5%) was consistent with the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group 
(66.1%) [Table 5.3.5.3.3-endometrial1: 36]. 
Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to dose reduction of lenvatinib 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in dose reduction of lenvatinib was higher in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab  EC  group  (65.0%)  than  in  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  group  (46.2%).  The  most 
frequently  reported  (incidence  ≥ 5%)  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  lenvatinib  dose  reduction  were 
hypertension,  diarrhoea,  PPES,  proteinuria,  fatigue,  decreased  appetite,  and  weight  decreased  in  the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (similar in both groups).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall population 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 were generally well balanced 
between  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  and  the  TPC  EC  group.  In  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group, all participants were female, and most were white (63.1%) or Asian (20.9%), 
with an ECOG performance status of 0 (60.1%), and a minority were based in the EU (28.1%). Half of 
them were under 65 year-of-age, and half of them over 65 year-of-age. Some differences were noted 
with the other groups (more participants ≥65 years of age, less white people, more Hispanic or Latino 
people, more participants with ECOG performance status of 0), but they are not expected to affect the 
interpretation of the safety results. 
Median duration  
The median duration of treatment was longer in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (9.79 
months)  compared  to  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  (7.59  months),  which  was  longer 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021

compared to the TPC EC group (3.43 months), the lenvatinib monotherapy safety dataset (5.55 months) 
and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (4.86 months). 
Adverse events 
The summary of AEs, despite showing similar proportions of overall AEs in the two arms, displayed a 
worse safety profile for the combination treatment group when compared to controls (TPC EC group), as 
shown by higher proportions of subjects with drug-related AEs (97.3% vs 93.8%, respectively), Grade 
3-5 drug-related AEs (77.8% vs 59%), drug-related SAEs (33.3% vs 14.2%), who had dose interruption 
of any drug due to an AE (69.2% vs 27.1%) or who discontinued any drug due to an AE (33% vs 8%). 
Proportions of fatal events and drug-related fatal events were comparable across study arms. However, 
when evaluating exposure-adjusted incidence rates, a partially reversed safety picture is found showing 
lower  incidence  rates  per  100  person-months,  respectively,  in  the  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group 
when compared to TPC group for AEs (232 vs 256, respectively), drug-related AEs (133 vs 153), Grade 
3-5 AEs (31.02 vs 48.78), drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs (18.52 vs 34.5), fatal events (0.59 vs 1.08), with 
comparable rates for SAEs, drug-related SAEs, and deaths due to drug-related AE. On the contrary, rates 
of dose modification (37.9 vs 18.6), dose interruption (21.18 vs 11.5), dose reduction (15.16 vs 4.76), 
and discontinuation due to AE (5 vs 2.32), to a drug-related AEs (3.98 vs. 1.76), to a SAEs (2.42 vs. 
0.85), or to a drug-related SAEs (1.63 vs. 0.45), remained higher in the study group of interest. 
Overall, the safety profile was similar between the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group and non-EC 
group.  Only  the  incidence  of  drug-related  Grade  3  to  5  AEs  was  higher  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group compared with the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (77.8% vs. 
65.7%). Enhanced toxicity was observed with the combination compared to the monotherapies for the 
following:  Grade  3  to  5  AEs  (88.9%  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  vs.  80.3%  lenvatinib 
monotherapy vs. 48.1% pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD), drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs (77.8% vs. 
64.7% vs. 15.5%, respectively), lenvatinib dose reduction due to an AE (66.5% combination vs. 47.5% 
monotherapy),  and  pembrolizumab  dose  interruption  due  to  AEs  (50%  combination  vs.  25.4% 
monotherapy). 
When  comparing  exposure-adjusted  rate,  the  overall  AE  summary  profile  of  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group was generally consistent with the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group, 
except  for  lower  rate  of  dose  interruption  of  any  drugs  due  to  AEs  (21.18  vs.  26.74),  and  lenvatinib 
interruption  due  to  AEs  (15.72  vs.  23.33);  and  higher  rate  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC 
group compared with the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group observed for Grade 3 to 5 AEs 
(31.02 vs. 25.73), drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs (18.52 vs. 12.24), drug-related SAEs (5.15 vs. 2.85); 
discontinuation due to AEs (5 vs. 3.1), to drug-related AEs (3.98 vs. 1.91), to a SAEs (2.42 vs. 1.74), 
or to a drug-related SAEs (1.63 vs. 0.87). 
The most common AEs (all and drug-related) with the combination therapy in EC are in general consistent 
with the known safety profiles of the respective monotherapies and the combination therapy in non-EC. 
The most frequent exposure-adjusted AEs in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group (> 4 events / 
100  person-months)  were  diarrhoea,  hypertension,  nausea,  vomiting,  hypothyroidism,  decreased 
appetite, proteinuria, arthralgia, fatigue, and weight decreased. All these AEs are identified very common 
ADRs  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  Hypertension,  nausea,  vomiting,  decreased  appetite,  proteinuria, 
arthralgia, fatigue, and weight decreased are known AEs associated with lenvatinib; hypothyroidism and 
diarrhoea have been described for both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. 
The criteria used to select the ADRs for the ADR table for the combination with pembrolizumab for EC in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC were as follows (meeting at least one of the criteria): 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021

- Lenvima ADR terms in the monotherapy column carried over for all subsequent columns when observed 
for the combination and adjusted to the appropriate frequency category based on the pooled data 
- Agency mandated terms 
- AEs occurring at an incidence higher than the respective monotherapy safety profiles were assessed 
for additive or potentiated effect and clinical relevance. 
 In addition, a paragraph similar to the Keytruda SmPC was added prior to the section 4.8 ADR table 
reading as follows : 
“Adverse reactions known to occur with lenvatinib or combination therapy components given alone may 
occur during treatment with these medicinal products in combination, even if these reactions were not 
reported in clinical studies with combination therapy.  
For additional safety information when lenvatinib is administered in combination, refer to the SmPC for 
the respective combination therapy component (pembrolizumab).” 
Of note, differences will remain with the Keytruda (pembrolizumab) SmPC as the ADR table has been 
updated to show the ADR with the combination of pembrolizumab with axitinib or Lenvatinib. 
The most frequently reported drug-related AEs (incidence ≥30%) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
EC group were hypertension, hypothyroidism, diarrhoea, nausea, and decreased appetite. All these drug-
related AEs are identified as very common ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8. Hypertension, nausea, and 
decreased appetite are known AEs associated with lenvatinib; hypothyroidism and diarrhoea have been 
described for both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group compared with the lenvatinib monotherapy group, the 
pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD, and the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group, there was a 
marked higher incidence (in %) of the following AEs (all and drug-related): hypothyroidism, anaemia, 
UTI,  ALT  increased,  AST  increased,  hypomagnesemia,  mucosal  inflammation,  hyperthyroidism,  Blood 
thyroid  stimulating  hormone  increased,  platelet  count  decreased,  neutropenia,  leukopenia,  and 
neutrophil count decreased.  
Thrombocytopenia  (including  decreased  platelet  count),  neutropenia  (including  decreased  neutrophil 
count), leukopenia (including decreased white blood cell count), oral inflammation (including mucosal 
inflammation),  hypothyroidism,  UTI,  ALT  increased,  AST  increased,  hypomagnesemia,  and  increased 
blood thyroid stimulating hormone are listed in the ADR table of section 4.8 of the SmPC for Lenvatinib 
monotherapy and for the combination.  
The most common Grade 3-5 AEs (all and drug-related) with the combination therapy in EC are in general 
consistent with the known safety profiles of the respective monotherapies and the combination therapy 
in non-EC. 
The most frequent exposure-adjusted Grade 3 to 5 AEs in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group 
(≥  0.5  events  /  100  person-months)  were  hypertension,  weight  decreased,  decreased  appetite, 
diarrhoea, lipase increased, anaemia, asthenia, proteinuria, fatigue, and hypokalemia. All these Grade 3 
to  5  AEs  are  identified  very  common  ADRs  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  All  these  AEs  are  known  AEs 
associated with lenvatinib or pembrolizumab or both. 
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  grade  3  to  5  AEs  (incidence  ≥4%)  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab  EC  group were  hypertension,  diarrhoea,  decreased  appetite, weight  decreased,  lipase 
increased, proteinuria, and asthenia. All these drug-related AEs are identified very common ADRs in the 
SmPC section 4.8.

The overall incidence of fatal AEs was comparable in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group (5.7% 
- 23 deaths), the TPC EC group (4.9% - 19 deaths), and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (5.3% - 
312 deaths), and lower than in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (10.4% – 24 deaths) 
and the lenvatinib monotherapy group (8.7% - 97 deaths). The overall incidence of drug-related fatal 
AEs was comparable in all groups: lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group (1.5% - 6 deaths), TPC EC 
group (2.1% - 8 deaths), lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (2.2% - 5 deaths), the lenvatinib 
monotherapy group (2.4% - 27 deaths) and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (0.7% - 39 deaths). 
Out  of  the  6  drug-related  fatal  AEs  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group,  1  death  due  to 
multiorgan dysfunction syndrome was considered by the investigator as related to both lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab.  One  death  each  due  to  cerebrovascular  accident,  right  ventricular  dysfunction, 
myelodysplastic syndrome, and death were considered by the investigator as related to lenvatinib, and 
1 death due to colitis was considered by the investigator as related to pembrolizumab.  
The  frequency,  type,  and  severity  of  SAEs  (all  and  drug-related)  reported  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab  EC  group  reflect  the  established  individual  safety  profiles  of  lenvatinib  and 
pembrolizumab  monotherapy  and  is  generally  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  when  used  in 
combination in non-EC. 
The most frequent exposure-adjusted SAEs in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group (≥ 0.2 events 
/ 100 person-months) were hypertension, UTI, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, vomiting, acute kidney 
injury, pyrexia, cholecystitis, colitis and pneumonia. The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs in 
the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  (incidence  ≥1%)  were  hypertension,  colitis,  decreased 
appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, pyrexia, and acute kidney injury. Of these, only pneumonia, colitis and 
pyrexia are not identified ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8. All these SAEs are known AEs associated with 
lenvatinib or pembrolizumab or both. 
The  types,  incidence,  severity  and  outcome  of  Clinically  Significant  Adverse  Events  associated  with 
Lenvatinib  (CSAE)  reported  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  were  generally  consistent 
with  the established  safety  profile of  lenvatinib  when  used  as  monotherapy, with  the exception  of  an 
increased  frequency  of  hepatotoxicity  (mainly  ALT  and  AST  increased,  Grade 1  to 3),  hypothyroidism 
(Grade 1 to 2), and renal events (mainly Blood creatinine increased, Grade 1 to 2). All these CSAE are 
identified as very common ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8. 
The  types,  incidence,  severity  and  outcome  of  Adverse  Events  of  Special  Interest  for  Pembrolizumab 
(AEOSI)  reported  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  were  generally  consistent  with  the 
established safety profile of pembrolizumab when used as monotherapy, with the exception of increased 
frequencies of hypothyroidism (Grade 1 to 2), hyperthyroidism (Grade 1 to 3) and colitis (Grade 1 to 3). 
Only hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are identified as very common ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Colitis have not been identified. There was 1 death in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group due 
to an AEOSI of colitis, which was considered by the investigator to be related to pembrolizumab. 
No  new  safety  concerns  based  on  laboratory  abnormalities  were  reported  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab  EC  group.  Overall,  the  most  frequently  reported  (≥30%)  laboratory  abnormalities 
(Grades  1  to  4)  were  similar  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  and  the  lenvatinib 
monotherapy  group,  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD,  and  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC 
group, and the majority were Grade 1 to 2 toxicity: ALT increased, AST increased, Albumin Decreased, 
alkaline Phosphatase Increased, Cholesterol Increased, Creatinine Increased, Haemoglobin Decreased, 
Lymphocytes  Decreased,  Magnesium  Decreased,  Potassium  Decreased,  Sodium  Decreased  and 
Triglycerides Increased. The frequencies based on laboratory values for the applicable ADRs in the ADR 
table in section 4.8 of the SmPC were reflected in line with the Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer 
medicinal products in man, EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5 - Section 8.9,

The  percentages  of  participants  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  with  Grade  3  to  4 
laboratory abnormalities were low and were generally consistent with the lenvatinib monotherapy group, 
pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD,  and  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC  group.  The  most 
frequently  reported  (incidence  ≥5%)  Grade  3  to  4  laboratory  abnormalities  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group were: Lymphocyte decreased (16.9%), sodium decreased (14.4%), potassium 
decreased  (10.7%),  AST  increased  (8.5%),  haemoglobin  decreased  (8.2%),  phosphate  decreased 
(8.2%),  glucose  increased  (8.0%),  ALT  increased  (7.7%),  platelets  decreased  (7.2%),  triglycerides 
increased (7.1%), magnesium decreased (6.9%), amylase increased (6.8%), and neutrophils decreased 
(5.9%). 
Three  participants  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  met  the  prespecified  drug-induced 
liver injury (DILI) criteria of increase in ALT or AST  ≥3 × ULN and bilirubin ≥1.5 × ULN and alkaline 
phosphatase  <2  ×  ULN.  DILI  is  an  identified  ADR  of  lenvatinib,  pembrolizumab  and  the  combination 
(under the name hepatitis). 
In  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group,  the  incidence  of  participants  with  AEs  that  led  to 
discontinuation  of  both  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab  was  14.0%,  with  discontinuation  of  lenvatinib 
(30.8%) higher than for pembrolizumab (18.7%). The types and incidences of AEs (all and drug-related) 
resulting in treatment discontinuation or interruption of both drugs were generally consistent with the 
safety profile of the combination in non-EC. The AEs (all and drug-related) that led to discontinuation or 
interruption  of  either  lenvatinib  or  pembrolizumab  were  generally  consistent  with  the  known  safety 
profiles  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  or  lenvatinib  monotherapy  (no  suggestion  of  new  safety 
concern). 
In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group, intestinal obstruction is the only ADR not identified in 
the  SmPC  that  had  led  to  lenvatinib  and/or  pembrolizumab  discontinuation  (led  also  to  lenvatinib 
discontinuation in lenvatinib monotherapy). Intestinal obstruction is a common complication of EC due 
to intra-abdominal tumor adhesions [Tuca et al., 2012]. 
In Study 309/KEYNOTE-775, the pembrolizumab dose was fixed at 200 mg Q3W and dose reduction was 
not  allowed.  The  types  and  incidences  of  AEs  (all  and  drug-related)  resulting  in  a  dose  reduction  of 
lenvatinib in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group were generally consistent with the lenvatinib 
monotherapy. 
Overall, several differences between the safety profiles of the different groups were justified as a result 
of  the  longer  duration  of  treatment  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  and  non-EC  groups 
compared to the other groups (increasing the time during which AEs could be collected). 
MMR status 
Per the study protocol in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775, the safety was assessed separately depending on 
the tumor mismatch repair (MMR) status. In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group and the TPC 
groups,  there  were  fewer  dMMR  participants  (n=64  and  63,  respectively)  as  compared  with  pMMR 
participants (n=342 and 325). However, because of the limited number of dMMR participants, definitive 
conclusions cannot be drawn. 
There  was  a  longer  duration  of  exposure  to  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  observed  for  dMMR 
participants (median: 335.5 days; range: 1 to 720 days) compared with pMMR participants (median: 
219.5 days; range: 1 to 817 days). On the contrary, there was a shorter duration of exposure to TPC 
observed  for  dMMR  participants  (median:  86  days;  range:  1  to  331  days)  compared  with  pMMR 
participants (median: 106 days; range: 1 to 785 days). 
Although the safety profile was overall the same by MMR status, in the dMMR participants compared with 
the pMMR participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group, there were higher incidence of: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021 
Page 137/154 
 
 
 
 
Grade 3 to 5 AEs (95.3% vs. 87.7%, respectively), drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs (85.9% vs. 76.3%), 
SAEs (68.8% vs. 49.7%), dose modifications due to AEs (100% vs. 92.4%), discontinuations due to AEs 
(43.8% vs. 31%), fatal AEs (10.9% vs. 4.7%), and fatal drug-related AEs (3.1% vs. 1.2%)  
In the pMMR and dMMR participants, the AEs (all and drug-related) that led to discontinuation and the 
AEs  that  led  to  interruption  of  both  drugs  or  of  either  lenvatinib  or  pembrolizumab  were  generally 
consistent with the results in the all-comers population. The AEs that most frequently led to lenvatinib 
dose reduction in pMMR and dMMR participants were generally consistent with those for the all-comer 
participants.  
When adjusted for exposure, in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group, the overall toxicity profile 
was  slightly  worst  for  the  pMMR  group  compared  to  the  dMMR  group  with  higher  incidences  of  AEs 
(237.35  vs  208.93),  drug-related  AEs  (138.43  vs  110.97),  dose  modification  due  to  an  AE  (39.35  vs 
31.8),  dose  interruption  due  to  an  AE  (22.12  vs  17.18),  and  dose  reduction  due  to  an  AE  (15.94  vs 
11.81).  When  adjusted  for  exposure,  the  observed  event  rates  of  AEOSI  for  dMMR  participants  were 
generally similar to the observed event rates for pMMR participants.  
In study KEYNOTE-158, the median duration of exposure to pembrolizumab was more than double for 
those  in  the  MSI-H/dMMR  group  compared  with  the  non-MSI-H/pMMR  group  (9.3  months  vs  3.42 
months). The overall incidence of AEs in participants in both groups was similar. The safety was generally 
consistent between the MSI-H and non-MSI-H groups except for a higher incidence of drug-related AEs 
in  the  MSI-H  group  (75.6%  vs  63.3%)  and  of  fatal  AEs  (3.3%  vs  0%).  However,  when  adjusted  for 
exposure, the overall toxicity profile was worst for the non-MSI-H/pMMR group compared to the MSI-
H/dMMR group with higher incidences of AEs (142.73 vs 104.11), drug-related AEs (37.46 vs 30.46), 
Grade 3 to 5 AEs (19.88 vs 9.74), SAEs (11.36 vs 5.21), and of fatal AEs (0.53 vs 0). For AEOSI, overall, 
the  incidence  of  the  Grade  3  to  5  AEs,  dose  modifications  and  deaths  due  to  an  AE,  including  drug-
related AEs were similar between the 2 groups. However, a lower incidence was observed in the non-
MSI-H/pMMR  group  compared  with  the  MSI-H/dMMR  group  for  the  AEOSI  (17.8%  vs  27.8%),  drug-
related AEOSI (15.6% vs 25.6%) and SAEs (2.2% vs 4.4%). When adjusted for exposure, the incidence 
of Grade 3 to 5 AEOSI was higher in the non-MSI-H/pMMR group (1.24 vs 0.58) otherwise the safety 
was consistent between groups. There was a limited number of participants in both groups (90 each); 
therefore, the data should be interpreted with caution. The observed differences in the safety profile of 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab between dMMR and pMMR participants might not be clinically meaningful. 
Intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
The  safety  findings  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  based  on  age,  gender,  ECOG 
performance  status,  and  region  were  generally  consistent  with  the  established  safety  profiles  of 
lenvatinib and pembrolizumab monotherapy. 
In  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  in  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775,  the  safety  profile  was 
generally similar for participants <65 and ≥65  year-of-age. However, the incidence of interruption of 
lenvatinib due to an AE, discontinuation of lenvatinib due to an AE or a drug-related AE, were higher in 
the  older  participants  (similarly  to  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC  group  and  lenvatinib 
monotherapy  group).  Moreover,  the  safety  profile  was  generally  similar  for  participants  <65,  65-74 
years, and ≥75 years. More participants in the ≥75 years of age group experienced drug-related SAEs, 
deaths, and discontinuation of lenvatinib (which was similar to the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-
EC group and lenvatinib monotherapy group). However, conclusions are limited due to the small number 
of participants in the ≥75 years of age group (i.e. 35 in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group in 
Study 309/KEYNOTE-775). 
In  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  in  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775,  central  nervous  system 
(confusion  /  extrapyramidal)  AEs,  AEs  related  to  falling,  cardiovascular  events,  and  infections  were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021

generally  similar  amongst  the  <65,  65-74,  and  ≥75  age  groups.  However,  cerebrovascular  events 
increased considerably with age: <65 (2%), 65-74 (3.6%), and >75 (11.4%). Arterial thromboembolic 
events (ATEs) (including cerebrovascular events) is a risk identified in section 4.4 of the SmPC and an 
important  identified  risk  in  the  RMP  where  it  is  mentioned  that  risk  factors  associated  with 
thromboembolic events in addition to the underlying malignant disease include age ≥65 years.  
Table  of  AEs  by  grade  and  by  age  categories  (<65,  65-74,  and  ≥75  age  groups)  for  the  2  groups  in 
Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 was provided. The most frequent AEs in the Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
group in the oldest age group were (≥ 30% and with higher frequency in oldest group): anaemia (all 
grade: 27.3%, 22.9%, 34.3%; respectively), UTI (all grade: 22.0%, 28.3%, 34.4%), and hypertension 
(≥  Grade  3:  33.2%,  42.2%,  45.7%).  The  SmPC  section  4.8  (special  populations)  has  been  adapted 
accordingly (for UTI and ≥ Grade 3 hypertension). 
The AE summary has also been provided by age categories (i.e. <75 and ≥75 years) for the following 
datasets:  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  and  the  TPC  EC  group; 
Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  +  KEYNOTE-146  +  KEYNOTE-581  Lenvatinib  +  Pembrolizumab  across 
indications; Lenvatinib monotherapy safety dataset; and Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD. As there is 
a limited number of participants ≥75 years of age in the pembrolizumab + lenvatinib group (n=35) and 
TPC group (n=39) from Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 and the pooled Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 + KEYNOTE-
146 + KEYNOTE-581 pembrolizumab + lenvatinib group (n=115), the data should be interpreted with 
caution.  The  observed  incidence  rates  of  the  AE  categories  of  the  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775 
lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group were generally similar in the <75 and ≥75 age groups, however higher 
rate were observed for the elderly for: drug-related SAEs, deaths, deaths due to a drug-related AE, and 
discontinuations  due  to  AE.  However,  as  a  similar  pattern  was  generally  observed  between  the  age 
groups in all datasets, this does not suggest a new safety concern for pembrolizumab + lenvatinib across 
age groups. 
All  participants  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  were  female.  The  AE  profile  based  on 
gender in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab EC group was generally consistent with the safety profiles 
of females treated with lenvatinib or pembrolizumab monotherapy. 
In  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  in  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775,  there  were  60.1%  of 
participants with ECOG performance status of 0 and 39.9% participants with ECOG of 1. In each group, 
the safety profiles were in generally consistent between participants with ECOG of 0 or 1. However, the 
incidence of SAEs, fatal AEs, and drug-related fatal AEs were increased in the participants with ECOG of 
1. 
In  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC  group  in  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775,  there  were  28.1%  of 
participants  from  EU  regions  and  71.9%  participants  not  from  EU  regions.  In  each  group,  the  safety 
profiles  were  in  generally  consistent  between  participants  from  EU  or  not.  However,  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab EC group and lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group presented higher incidence 
of dose reduction of lenvatinib due to AEs in the participants not from EU (difference not observed in the 
lenvatinib monotherapy group). 
Table of the frequencies of AEs by grade and by ethnicity for the 2 groups in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 
was provided. There was a limited number of participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and TPC 
treatment  groups  who  were  Asian  (n=85  and  n=86,  respectively)  or  from  other  ethnicity  (n=29  and 
n=34, respectively); therefore, the data should be interpreted with caution. The incidences and severity 
of the most frequently reported AEs (incidence ≥15%) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group were 
generally  similar  between  the  different  categories  with  the  following  differences  (≥10%  difference) 
noted:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021 
Page 139/154 
 
 
 
 
-  AEs  higher  in  Whites  than  Asians:  mucosal  inflammation  (14.1%  vs  1.2%),  abdominal  pain 
(23.0%  vs  8.2%),  UTI  (29.7%  vs  12.9%),  diarrhoea  (57.4%  vs  47.1%;  Grade  ≥3:  7.4%  vs 
10.6%), weight decreased (37.1% vs 27.1%), hypomagnesaemia (21.5% vs 4.7%), dizziness 
(13.7% vs 1.2%), asthenia (27.3% vs 3.5%; Grade ≥3: 7.4% vs 0%), and fatigue (39.1% vs 
17.6%)  
-  AEs  higher  in  Asians  than  Whites:  anaemia  (34.1%  vs  23.4%;  Grade  ≥3:  10.6  %  vs  4.3%), 
malaise (23.5% vs 0.8%), oedema (12.9% vs 2.3%), neutrophil count decrease (16.5% vs 2%; 
Grade ≥3: 9.4% vs 0.4%), stomatitis (37.6% vs 14.1%), platelet count decreased (32.9% vs 
7.0%, Grade ≥3: 10.6% vs 0.8%), proteinuria (51.8% vs 22.3%; Grade ≥3: 10.6% vs 3.9%), 
PPE (40.0% vs 13.3%; Grade ≥3: 5.9% vs 2.0%), and pyrexia (31.8% vs 10.5%) 
All AEs are ADRs for the combination with the exception of pyrexia and oedema (as shown in ADR table 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC), which were reported as primarily Grade 1 or 2 events. The SmPC section 
4.8 (ethnic origin) has been adapted accordingly. 
As  of  the  data  cut-off,  there  were  no  reports  of  pregnancy  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  EC 
group. 
Data received after initial assessment 
Fifty-two AEs for 6 clinical study participants enrolled at a single study center started prior to the data 
cut-off for interim analysis 1 (IA1) (data cut-off 26 October 2020) of Study 309/KEYNOTE-775, but were 
not entered into the database at the time of the database lock (20 November 2020) that was used to 
support the CSR and eCTD summary modules in the extension of indication submission.   
These AEs  were identified by site monitors and entered retrospectively into the database prior to the 
next database lock performed to provide data for the 90-day Safety Update Report (SUR). This 90-day 
SUR includes additional safety data reported between the IA1 data cutoff of 26-Oct-2020 and the SUR 
data  cutoff  of  08  February  2021  (database  lock  on  22  March  2021),  representing  an  additional  3.5 
months of safety data from Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 (SUR not submitted). 
The main contributing factors for this GCP deviation were incomplete documentation with subsequent 
late entry of safety data by the site and insufficient oversight by the Principal Investigator (enhanced by 
the COVID-19 pandemic). Corrective / preventive actions have been implemented. 
None of these AEs were fatal AEs or SAEs. Out of these 52 AEs, there were: 
-  31 AEs in 2 subjects in the combination group: mainly grade 1 or 2, with 1 Grade 3 hypertension 
and 1 Grade 4 lipase elevation, both assessed per investigator as related to Lenvatinib.  
-  21 AEs in 4 subjects in the chemotherapy group: mainly grade 1 or 2, with 1 Grade 3 vomiting 
related to doxorubicin. 
No new safety signals were identified and safety was consistent with that reported in the initial CSR. 
These  additional  52  AEs  are  not  impacting  the  previous  benefit/risk  assessment  (+0.34%  in  the 
combination  arm  vs  +0.46%  in  the  TPC  arm),  and the  additional  3.5  months  data  (after  IA1) will be 
submitted after marketing authorisation during the pharmacovigilance follow-up.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of lenvatinib+pembrolizumab combination for treatment of advanced EC in patients 
who have disease progression following prior platinum-based systemic therapy in any setting and are 
not  candidates  for  curative  surgery  or  radiation  was  not  substantially  different  from  that  of  standard 
Assessment report

chemotherapy based on physician’s choice, although with different types of AEs as expected from the 
different class of drugs. 
The apparent worse safety profile of lenvatinib+pembrolizumab for most AEs and drug-related AEs was 
partially reverted at exposure-adjusted incidence analysis showing slightly lower rates with the treatment 
of interest as compared to chemotherapy, while SAEs and deaths did not differ between groups. Dose 
interruptions  and  treatment  discontinuations  (mostly  related  to  lenvatinib)  occurred  however  more 
frequently in the lenvatinib+pembrolizumab arm than in controls, also when adjusted for exposure. 
Well-known  safety  concerns  associated  with  lenvatinib  (CSAEs)  and  with  pembrolizumab  (AEOSIs) 
(especially  the  latter)  were  more  common  with  the  combination  treatment  than  with  the  single-drug 
regimens,  which 
is 
in 
line  with 
the  safety  pattern 
found 
for  non-EC 
indications  of 
lenvatinib+pembrolizumab treatment. Most of these AEs presented with the expected severity and were 
managed following consolidated indications.  
No new safety concerns were identified. 
Overall,  IV  pembrolizumab  200  mg  Q3W  in  combination  with  oral  lenvatinib  20  mg  QD  showed  a 
manageable safety profile in the advanced endometrial carcinoma population that is generally consistent 
with the established safety profiles of the individual pembrolizumab and lenvatinib monotherapies, and 
the safety profile of the combination in non-EC.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s), which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative(s) of Bulgaria, Estonia, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania, 
Slovenia, United Kingdom (Northern Ireland). 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The proposed changes in the context of this extension of indication do not involve a relevant impact on 
the PIL. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The MAH applied for an extension of indication for lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in 
second line endometrial carcinoma patients: 
“LENVIMA in combination with pembrolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced endometrial carcinoma (EC) who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy 
in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation (see section 5.1)”. 
During the procedure, the indication was updated as follows:  
• 
LENVIMA, in combination with lenvatinib, is indicated for the treatment of advanced or recurrent 
endometrial  carcinoma  in  adults  who  have  disease  progression  on  or  following  prior  treatment 
with  a  platinum-containing  systemic  therapy  in  any  setting  and  who  are  not  candidates  for 
curative surgery or radiation (see section 5.1). 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer among women worldwide1 and the most common 
gynaecological cancer in developed countries, with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years. 
Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium is typically divided in type I (70-80%) which include the less 
aggressive endometrioid histology, and type II (20-30%) comprising non-endometrioid histologies, 
having poorer prognosis2. Microsatellite unstable tumours (MSI-H) is one of the four clinically 
significant molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer with different clinical prognoses3.

Most of endometrial cancer patients are diagnosed when disease is localized, and the prognosis for EC 
is significantly influenced by disease stage. Patients with regional and distant metastatic disease have 
5-year survival rates of 69% and 16.8%, respectively4. Approximately 20% of EC cases recur with 
poor prognosis5. In general, the median survival of patients with recurrent or advanced disease is 12 
months6.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently, the mainstay of treatment of EC is surgery with hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy; based on the risk stratification, adjuvant treatment radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy 
are used7. Hormonal therapy can be used as systemic treatment for front-line hormone receptor-
positive grade 1 or 2 tumours in the absence of rapidly progressive disease37. Endometrial cancer is a 
relatively chemo-sensitive disease, with anthracyclines, platinum-based drugs and taxanes shown to 
be the most active agents. For patients with advanced disease not amenable to radical treatment, 
according to ESMO guidelines, the standard of care is carboplatin and paclitaxel as first line 
treatment37. Cytotoxic chemotherapy as second-line treatment after platinum-containing therapy is 
supported by limited evidence, especially with treatment-free interval following first-line chemotherapy 
<6–12 months, and it is generally associated with low response rates (≤ 15%), limited PFS (4 
months), and toxicity8. 
In the EU, the anti-PD1 antibody Jemperli (dostarlimab) has been approved in 2021 for the treatment 
of adult patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) 
recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer (EC) that has progressed on or following prior treatment 
with a platinum-containing regimen.  
Reported median PFS of <4 months reflects the rapid disease progression of advanced EC, and the 
need for therapeutics to control disease soon after treatment initiation. Advanced EC patients often 
have substantial morbidity from prior therapy (surgery, radiation, platinum-based chemotherapy) or 
their disease, which often includes intraabdominal involvement that can lead to debilitating ascites, 
bowel obstruction, fistula, and perforation. Therefore, rapid disease control of advanced EC is essential 
to both maintain QoL and prolong survival in these patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study-309/KEYNOTE-775 is a multicenter, open-label, randomized 1:1, Phase 3 trial to compare the 
efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab versus treatment of physician’s 
choice (paclitaxel or doxorubicin) in participants with advanced endometrial cancer (EC) progressed 
after prior platinum-based therapy. The results of the Interim Analysis 1 (i.e. final for PFS, interim for 
OS) with data cut-off date 26 October 2020 have been submitted. The median duration of follow up in 
the overall population is 11.4 months (range 0.3, 26.9).

3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  Study-309/KEYNOTE-755 showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant PFS benefit of 
lenvatinib+pembrolizumab versus standard chemotherapy in all comers (HR 0.56, 95%CI 0.47, 
0.66, p>0.0001 one-sided, median PFS 7.2 vs 3.8 months) and in pMMR primary populations 
(HR 0.60, 95%CI 0.50, 0.72, p<0.0001 one-sided, median PFS 6.6 vs 3.8 months) at the final 
PFS analysis. 
•  A statistically significant and clinically relevant benefit of lenvatinib+pembrolizumab versus 
chemotherapy was shown in OS in all comers (HR 0.62, 95%CI 0.51, 0.75, p<0.0001 one-
sided, median OS 18.3 versus 11.4 months) and in pMMR (HR 0.68, 95%CI 0.56, 0.84, 
p=0.0001 one-sided, median OS from 17.4 versus 12 month) at the interim OS analysis, with 
about 50% of patients with a death event. OS curves overlap up to month 3 and remained 
consistently separated throughout the duration of the evaluation period. All p-values are one 
sided. 
•  ORR improvement was seen for lenvatinib+pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in all comers 
[31.9% (27.4, 36.6), versus 14.7% (11.4, 18.4)] as well as in pMMR population [30.3% (25.5, 
35.5) versus 15.1% (11.5, 19.3)]. CR rates were also higher for the combination.  
• 
In the all comers, the median DOR was longer in the experimental arm (14.4 vs 5.7 months), 
with higher number of durable responses (71.9% versus 42.6% of responding subjects for ≥6 
months). The same trend was observed in the pMMR subgroup (median DOR 9.2 versus 5.7 
months, durable responses lasting ≥6 months 65.6% versus 42.1%). 
•  Consistent treatment effect across all main subgroups analysed.  
• 
The benefit of the combination is also observed in the smaller dMMR subgroup (not formally 
tested), where efficacy of the combination appears higher compared to what observed in the 
pMMR population (PFS HR 0.36, OS HR 0.37, ORR 40% versus 12.3%, CR 13.8% versus 3.1%, 
median DOR NR versus 4.1 months).   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
• 
The population of Study 309/ KEYNOTE-775 possibly reflects a fitter subgroup of subjects with 
advanced endometrial carcinoma in terms of ECOG and comorbidities, and it might not be fully 
representative of an endometrial cancer population with generally dismal prognosis. The exclusion of 
patients with ECOG ≥2 from clinical studies is mentioned in section 4.4 of the SmPC and also reflected 
in the description of Study 309- KEYNOTE-775 study in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
• 
Lack of direct comparison of the combination with each monotherapy, especially with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy relative to the dMMR subgroup. Results by MMR subgroup have been 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Data on indirect comparison in the dMMR population are reflected 
in this assessment report. 
• 
No data on PD-L1 status have been collected in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 and consequently no 
subgroup analyses by PD-L1 expression have been conducted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/618201/2021 
Page 149/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
OS data is not fully mature yet and this limits the efficacy estimation at this moment. The MAH 
is recommended to submit the results from the final OS analysis in the overall population and by MMR 
biomarker by Q4 2022. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Compared  to  standard  chemotherapy,  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  displayed  a  worse  safety  profile,  as 
shown  by  higher  proportions  of  subjects  with  drug-related  AEs  (97.3%  versus  93.8%,  respectively), 
Grade 3-5 drug-related AEs (77.8% versus 59%), drug-related SAEs (33.3% versus 14.2%), who had 
dose interruption of any drug due to an AE (69.2% versus 27.1%) or who discontinued any drug due to 
an  AE  (33%  versus  8%).  Proportions  of  fatal  events  and  drug-related  fatal  events  were  comparable 
across study arms.  
When evaluating exposure-adjusted incidence rates per 100 person-months, a partially reversed safety 
picture is found: AEs 232 versus 256, drug-related AEs 133 versus 153, Grade 3-5 AEs 31.02 versus 
48.78,  drug-related  Grade  3-5  AEs  18.52  versus  34.5,  and  fatal  events  0.59  versus  1.08.  For  SAEs 
(10.15  and  10.08  per  100  person-months  in  the  combination  arm  and  controls,  respectively),  drug-
related SAEs (5.15 and 4.08), and deaths due to drug-related AE (0.15 and 0.45) the incidence rate of 
events was comparable across study arms. However, the proportion of subjects with dose modification 
(37.9 versus 18.6 per 100 person-months), dose interruption (21.18 versus 11.5), dose reduction (15.16 
versus 4.76), and discontinuation due to AE (5 versus 2.32), to a drug-related AEs (3.98 versus. 1.76), 
to a SAEs (2.42 versus 0.85), or to a drug-related SAEs (1.63 versus 0.45), all remained higher in the 
study group of interest. 
The  most  common  AEs  in  the  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group  were: 
hypertension (64%), hypothyroidism (57.4%), diarrhoea (54.2%), nausea (49.5%), decreased appetite 
(44.8%), vomiting (36.7%), weight decreased (34%), fatigue (33%), arthralgia (30.5%).  
The  well-known  safety  concerns  associated  with  pembrolizumab  (AEOSIs)  were  reported  in  67.2%  of 
Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 combination arm participants, and in 25.1% pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD 
subjects.  Most  often  reported  AEOSIs  were  hypothyroidism  (57.6%),  hyperthyroidism  (11.6%),  and 
colitis (4.7%).  
The frequency and severity of CSAEs in the Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group 
was generally consistent with those found in the non-EC lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and the 
lenvatinib  monotherapy  SD,  with  the  exception  of  the  CSAEs  of  hepatotoxicity  (33.7%  versus  17.5% 
and 19.6%, respectively), hypothyroidism (68.2% versus 19.8% and 43.5%), and renal events (18.2% 
versus 10.0% and 18.7%). Most CSAEs resolved, and only few resulted in treatment discontinuation. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
More  participants  in  the  ≥75  years  of  age  group  experienced  drug-related  SAEs,  deaths,  and 
discontinuation of lenvatinib compared to the other age categories (which was similar to the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab non-EC group and lenvatinib monotherapy group). However, conclusions are limited 
due to the small number of participants in the ≥75 years of age group (i.e.  35 in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab EC group in Study 309/KEYNOTE775). Section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated to reflect 
that patients  of  age  ≥75 years  were  more  likely  to  experience  some  adverse  reactions.  Furthermore, 
reduced tolerability of lenvatinib in elderly patients is also mentioned in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

The use in patients with severe hepatic impairment or with severe renal impairment, and long-term use 
safety remain a missing information as listed in the RMP and will continue to be mitigated by routine 
pharmacovigilance activities and routine risk minimisations measures.

3.8.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In Study-309/KEYNOTE-775 a statistically significant and clinically meaningful advantage was shown on 
PFS  and  OS  outcomes  for  the  combination  pembrolizumab  +  lenvatinib  as  compared  to  standard 
chemotherapy  (doxorubicin  or  paclitaxel,  TPC)  in  the  setting  with  dismal  prognosis  of  advanced 
endometrial cancer patients progressed to at least one prior platinum-based therapy not amenable for 
curative  treatment.  ORR  for  the  combination  was  not  outstanding  but  was  doubled  compared  to  the

standard treatment. These results were however obtained in a trial population apparently more fit and 
with  less  comorbidities  compared  to  the  target  population,  restricted  to  patients  with  ECOG  0-1.  The 
benefit  of  the  combination  over  TPC  was  shown  in  the  all  comers  as  well  as  in  the  pMMR  population 
(populations for the primary analyses) and was evident also in the dMMR subgroup. However, the design 
of the study lacking monotherapy arms hampers the assessment of the contribution of each component 
to  the  combination,  which  has  been  supported  with  indirect  comparison  with  pembrolizumab  and 
lenvatinib  single  arm  trials.  Noting  the  limitations  of  cross  trial  comparison,  added  to  some  baseline 
differences in populations enrolled in these studies, it can be suggested that both pembrolizumab and 
lenvatinib,  each  having  a  limited  activity  in  this  setting  separately,  are  contributing  to  the  treatment 
effect in the combination regimen in pMMR EC population. On the contrary, in the dMMR subgroup the 
activity  of  the  pembrolizumab  +  lenvatinib  does  not  appear  significantly  different  as  compared  to 
pembrolizumab  alone,  whilst  lenvatinib  adds  toxicity.  Overall,  the  combination  appears  indeed  not 
particularly well tolerated, with higher rate of discontinuations due to adverse event compared to the 
chemotherapy  arm.  The  safety  profile  of  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  is  different  compared  to 
chemotherapy, as expected, and consistent with the known safety profile of both drugs, with no new 
safety concern identified. In elderly individuals, for pembrolizumab an increased toxicity for several AE 
categories (drug-related grade 3-5 AEs, drug-related SAE, death due to AE, discontinuation due to AE) 
is noted when the drug is administered in combination with lenvatinib as compared to pembrolizumab 
monotherapy. 
3.8.1.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab represents an effective treatment with a 
manageable safety profile and is a valuable treatment option for the population of patients with second 
line recurrent or advanced EC as compared to standard chemotherapy. A clinical benefit of lenvatinib in 
combination with pembrolizumab was shown over the chemotherapy options for participants with 
advanced EC in the overall population. The safety profile of lenvatinib+pembrolizumab combination is 
different compared to chemotherapy, as expected, and consistent with the known safety profile of both 
drugs, with no new safety concern identified, although the combination overall appears not to be 
particularly well tolerated. 
3.8.2.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None. 
3.9.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab after treatment with platinum-based 
therapy is positive. 
The following measure is considered necessary to address issues to address issues related to efficacy: 
Final OS data of 309/KEYNOTE-775 in overall population and by MMR biomarker should be submitted as 
a recommendation (expected in 4Q2022).

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of 
adult patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma (EC) who have disease progression following 
prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet 
is updated in accordance. Version 14.1 of the RMP has also been agreed. In addition, the MAH took 
the opportunity to make minor editorial changes to the SmPC, Annex II and to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet in line with the latest QRD template version 10.2.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

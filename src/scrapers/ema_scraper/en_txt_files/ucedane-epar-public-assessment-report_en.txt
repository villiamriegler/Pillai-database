2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
About the product 
The proposed product is an immediate release 200 mg dispersible tablets containing carglumic acid as active 
substance.  Carglumic  acid  is  a  chemical  substance  and  the  dosage  form  has  been  developed  as  generic 
product  to  the  centrally  authorised  product  Carbaglu  200  mg  dispersible  tablets  containing  the  same  active 
substance in the same pharmaceutical form. 
Carglumic  acid  (also  called  N-carbamyl-L-glutamate,  or  carbamylglutamate)  is  an  orally  active  deacylase-
resistant  synthetic  structural  N-acetylglutamate  (NAG)  analogue.  NAG,  which  is  formed  by  the  hepatic 
enzyme  N-acetylglutamate  synthase  (NAGS),  is  an  essential  allosteric  activator  of  the  enzyme  carbamoyl 
phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS-1). CPS-1 plays an essential role in the urea cycle and converts ammonia into 
urea  which  prevents  hyperammonaemia.  Despite  a  lower  affinity  of  carbamoyl  phosphate  synthetase  for 
carglumic  acid  than  for  N-acetylglutamate,  carglumic  acid  has  been  shown  in  vivo  to  stimulate  carbamoyl 
phosphate synthetase and to be much more effective than N-acetylglutamate in protecting against ammonia 
intoxication in rats.  
Upon oral administration, Carglumic acid is taken up enterally and replaces NAG in the activation of CPS-1, 
thus being the definitive therapy for NAGS deficiency (Häberle, 2012; PubChem, 2015). 
This application for marketing authorisation is a generic application for Ucedane 200 mg, dispersible tablets, 
and included a hybrid application for Ucedane 50 mg, dispersible tablets according to Articles 10(1) and 10(3) 
of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404487/2017 
Page 7/25 
 
  
  
Carglumic acid was first authorised in the EU as Carbaglu dispersible tablets in January 2003. At the time of 
approval  Carbaglu  was  indicated  for the  treatment  of  hyperammonaemia  associated  with  N-acetylglutamate 
synthase deficiency.  
Subsequently, the approved indications for Carbaglu have been extended and is now also authorised for the 
treatment  of  hyperammonaemia  due  to,  isovaleric  acidaemia,  methymalonic  acidaemia,  or  propionic 
acidaemia.  
Ucedane  is  indicated  in  treatment  of  hyperammonaemia  due  to  N-acetylglutamate  synthase  primary 
deficiency. 
Proposed posology and method of administration for Ucedane 
Posology 
Based on clinical experience, the treatment may be started as early as the first day of life.  The initial daily 
dose should be 100 mg/kg, up to 250 mg/kg if necessary. 
It  should  then  be  adjusted  individually  in  order  to  maintain  normal  ammonia  plasma  levels  (see section 
4.4). 
In  the  long  term,  it  may  not  be  necessary  to  increase  the  dose  according  to  body  weight  as  long  as 
adequate  metabolic  control  is  achieved;  daily  doses  range  from  10  mg/kg  to  100  mg/kg. 
Carglumic acid responsiveness test 
It  is  recommended  to  test  individual  responsiveness  to  carglumic  acid  before  initiating  any long term 
treatment. As examples: 
- 
In a comatose child, start with a dose of 100 to 250 mg/kg/day and measure ammonia plasma 
concentration at least before each administration; it should normalise within a  few hours after 
starting Ucedane. 
- 
In  a  patient  with  moderate  hyperammonaemia,  administer  a  test  dose  of  100  to  200 mg/kg/day 
for  3  days with  a  constant  protein  intake  and  perform  repeated  determinations  of  ammonia 
plasma  concentration  (before  and  1  hour  after  a  meal);  adjust the dose in order to maintain normal 
ammonia plasma levels. 
Method of administration 
This medicine is for oral use ONLY (ingestion or via nasogastric tube using a syringe, if necessary). 
Based on pharmacokinetic data and clinical experience, it is recommended to divide the total daily dose into 
two to four intakes to be given before meals or feedings. The breaking of the tablets in halves allows most of 
the required posology adjustments. It is not possible to administer Ucedane to patients who require dose 
adjustments of 50 mg. In such cases, other carglumic acid products which allow for these dose adjustments 
should be used. 
The tablets must be dispersed in a minimum of 5-10 mL of water and ingested immediately or administered by 
fast push through a syringe via a nasogastric tube. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The initial application for marketing authorisation was a generic application for Ucedane 200 mg, dispersible 
tablets,  but  also  included  a  hybrid  application  for  Ucedane  50  mg,  dispersible  tablets  according  to  Articles 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404487/2017 
Page 8/25 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
10(1)  and  10(3)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  as  amended.  During  the  procedure  the  Applicant  decided  to 
withdraw the hybrid application for Ucedane 50 mg dispersible tablets. 
The  reference  medicinal  product  is  Carbaglu  200mg  tablets  by  the  company  Orphan  Europe  S.A.R.L., 
originally  authorised 
in  the  community  on  24  January  2003  (marketing  authorisation  numbers 
EU/1/02/246/001, EU/1/02/246/002 and EU/1/02/246/003). 
Bioequivalence with the product Carbaglu 200mg tablets by the company Orphan Europe S.A.R.L. is claimed. 
The CHMP Guidelines were followed. The applicant did not receive CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the 
clinical investigation. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as dispersible tablets containing 200 mg of carglumic acid as active 
substance.  
Other ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, colloidal anhydrous silica, sodium stearyl fumarate, 
crospovidone type B, copovidone K28. 
The product is available in blisters (aluminium/aluminium) packed in cartons as described in section 6.5 of 
the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance, carglumic acid, is N-Carbamyl-L-glutamic acid corresponding to 
the molecular formula C6H10N2O5.  
It has a relative molecular mass 190.16 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1. Structure of carglumic acid 
The molecular structure of carglumic acid was confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 
carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry with fragmentation study, infrared 
spectrometry and elemental analysis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404487/2017 
Page 9/25 
 
  
  
 
Carglumic acid exists as a white powder or colourless crystals. It is soluble in boiling water, slightly soluble in 
cold water and practically insoluble in organic solvents (cyclohexane, dichloromethane, ether).  The water 
solubility of carglumic acid at pH 2.0 is 21.0 g/L. It increases rapidly between the pH 3.0 (28.2 g/L) and the 
pH 5.0 (440.9 g/L). The solubility of carglumic acid in water is stable between pH 6.0 (555.5 g/L) and pH 8.0 
(553.9 g/L). 
Carglumic acid is prepared from L-glutamic acid. It exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one 
chiral centre and has one optical isomer; N-carbamoyl-D-glutamic acid. The enantiomeric purity of carglumic 
acid is controlled routinely by specific optical rotation and chiral HPLC tests. 
Polymorphism has not been observed for carglumic acid. Polymorphism studies showed there is no 
enantiotropic polymorphism of carglumic acid and the crystal structure is orthorhombic. This has been 
confirmed by X-ray analyses.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Information on the manufacture of the active substance was provided via an ASMF procedure. Carglumic acid 
is synthesized from a commercially available well defined starting material with acceptable specifications. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. The packaging components comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 
10/2011, as amended, and Ph. Eur. requirements.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR, HPLC), specific optical 
rotation (Ph. Eur.), melting point (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. 
Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), D-enantiomer of carglumic acid (HPLC), related substances/impurities (HPLC) 
and assay (HPLC). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for 3 production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 3 production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for 36 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 
6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The following parameters were tested; appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), related 
substances/impurities (HPLC), D-enantiomer of carglumic acid (HPLC) and assay (HPLC). The analytical 
Assessment report

methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. All tested parameters were within 
the specifications.  
Results of forced degradation studies performed under stress conditions (in acid medium, alkaline medium, 
and after exposure to oxidation, light and heat in dry or wet conditions) were also provided on one batch. The 
results show that carglumic acid is mainly sensitive to acidic medium and heat and moderately sensitive to 
oxidation when dissolved in water. The resolution of the peak of carglumic acid and its degradation products 
was satisfactory. The peak purity of carglumic acid was good in every condition and time. The results confirm 
the HPLC method for purity test and assay of carglumic acid is specific and stability indicative. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored in the proposed 
container in climatic zones I and II. F 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product  
Ucedane dispersible tablets contain 200 mg of carglumic acid. 
The tablets are white, oval and biconvex with score line and engraving LL on one side. 
Other ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, colloidal anhydrous silica, sodium stearyl fumarate, 
crospovidone type B, copovidone K28. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. The final excipients chosen for 
Ucedane dispersible tablets are different to those of the reference product (Carbaglu), but this is not 
expected to have a significant impact on the performance of the finished product.

In order to be able to deliver appropriate incremental doses to patients it was decided to develop two 
separate tablet strengths, 200 mg and 50 mg. The proposed Ucedane 200 mg tablets were white, oval and 
biconvex with score line and engraving LL on one side and the Ucedane 50 mg tablets were white, round and 
biconvex, with engraving L on one side. 
An open-label, two-way cross-over bioequivalence study was performed to compare the pharmacokinetic 
profile of a single oral dose of Ucedane 200 mg dispersible tablet (test product) with a single oral dose of 
Carbaglu 200 mg dispersible tablet (reference product). For details of the clinical assessment of this 
bioequivalence study please refer to section 2.4 of this report. 
Comparative dissolution profile testing between Ucedane 200 mg dispersible tablets and Carbaglu 200 mg 
dispersible tablets used in the bioequivalence study using dissolution medium with various pH values (0.1 N 
HCl, pH 4.5, pH 6.8) was requested by CHMP and subsequently provided by the applicant. The dissolution 
profiles of the two products were similar at pH 4.5 and 6.8, as more than 85% was dissolved within 15 
minutes for both products. At pH 1.2, more than 85% in average was dissolved within 15 minutes for both 
products but some individual values were less than 85% at 15 minutes for the reference product. As the 
bioequivalence study submitted by the Applicant demonstrated the bioequivalence of the two products, in 
was concluded that the minor observed difference in dissolution profiles of the two products at pH 1.2 did not 
have any impact on bioavailability and was therefore acceptable. 
In parallel to the generic application for Ucedane 200 mg dispersible tablets, the applicant initially proposed 
the additional strength, Ucedane 50 mg dispersible tablet, as a hybrid application under Article 10(3) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC, supported by a biowaiver of strength. The hybrid application for Ucedane 50 mg 
dispersible tablets was subsequently withdrawn by the Applicant before the procedure was finalised.  
The Applicant demonstrated that the scoreline on Ucedane 200 mg dispersible tablets allows the tablet to be 
divided into equal halves (containing 100 mg carglumic acid). The proposed finished product specification 
includes a routine test for compliance with the Ph. Eur. subdivision of tablets test described in the Tablets 
monograph (0478).  
Following withdrawal of the hybrid application for Ucedane 50 mg dispersible tablets, the applicant proposed 
that a 50 mg dose could be obtained from a Ucedane 200 mg dispersible tablet either with the help of a knife 
or a tablet splitter. The CHMP concluded that use of knife or tablet splitter is not considered an appropriate 
approach for accurate dosing in clinical practice, and that the posology of Ucedane 200 mg dispersible tablets 
should therefore not include any reference to a 50 mg dose. Nevertheless, in the context of the obligation of 
the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends that the applicant 
should consider performing further pharmaceutical development studies in order to design a product which 
can deliver a dosing posology of 50 mg increments (e.g. additional score lines on the Ucedane 200 mg tablet 
to facilitate further subdivision of the tablet halves or development of a separate 50 mg strength of Ucedane 
dispersible tablets). For details of the clinical assessment of this aspect please refer to section 2.4 of this 
report. 
In order to demonstrate the discriminatory power of the routine QC dissolution method, formulations differing 
significantly in composition (disintegrant and binder contents) and active substance particle size were tested, 
however the discriminatory power of the dissolution method could not be demonstrated, despite selecting 
dissolution conditions that favour discriminatory power (e.g. low pH, stirring speed, earlier sample 
timepoint). It was concluded that this is probably a consequence of the relatively high solubility and 
dissolution rate of carglumic acid. The proposed conditions of the dissolution test method were therefore

accepted, in line with the Reflection paper on the dissolution specification for generic oral immediate release 
products (EMA/332805/2016). 
The primary packaging is an aluminium/aluminium blister of 12 tablets per strip. The material complies with 
Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of the following main steps:  
• 
• 
• 
preparation  of  the  bulk  mixture  of  active  substance  and  excipients  (weighing,  sieving  and  blending 
steps); 
tableting (compression step);  
packaging (blister packing step). 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this  type  of  manufacturing  process  and  pharmaceutical  form.  Process  validation  was  carried  out  on  three 
batches  at  commercial  scale.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form; appearance, 
identification  (IR,  HPLC),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.),  related  substances/impurities  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), fineness of dispersion (Ph. Eur.), breakability (Ph. Eur.), disintegration 
(Ph. Eur.) and microbiology (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. The proposed acceptance criteria have been adequately justified the applicant and are in 
compliance with relevant scientific guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  3  batches  of  finished  product  stored  under  long  term  conditions  for  24  months  at  30  ºC  / 
65%  RH  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH 
guidelines were provided. These validation batches of Ucedane are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested 
for  routine  stability  tests  of  appearance,  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.),  related 
substances/impurities  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  fineness  of  dispersion  (Ph.  Eur.),  disintegration  (Ph.  Eur.)  and 
microbiology  (Ph.  Eur.).  In  addition,  these  validation  batches  were  also  tested  for  uniformity  of  mass  (Ph. 
Eur.),  breakability  (Ph.  Eur.),  breaking  strength  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  loss  on  drying  (LOD).  The  analytical 
procedures used were stability indicating.  
Assessment report

In  addition  to  these  studies,  one  batch  was  exposed  to  freezing  conditions  (-20ºC  for  1  month)  and  high 
temperature (60°C ± 5°C for 4 days).The provided results comply with the specifications in all studies and no 
significant changes have been observed. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months with no special storage conditions 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of Ucedane 200 mg dispersible tablets is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance 
with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- 
The applicant should consider performing further pharmaceutical development studies in order to 
design a product which can deliver a dosing posology of 50 mg increments (e.g. additional score lines 
on the Ucedane 200 mg tablet to facilitate further subdivision of the tablet halves or development of 
a separate 50 mg strength of Ucedane dispersible tablets). 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
Assessment report

Page 14/25 
 
  
  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant did not submit a complete Environmental Risk Assessment. This was justified by the applicant 
as the introduction of Ucedane manufactured by Lucane Pharma is considered unlikely to result in any 
significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all carglumic acid containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not 
increased.  
Nevertheless, a Phase I evaluation was performed to assess the potential environmental exposure of 
carglumic acid.  
The log Kow value of carglumic acid of -1.097 as provided in the material safety data sheet (Sigma-Aldrich) 
is below the threshold of 4.5, as stipulated in the EMA Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010). Therefore, the applicant considered that 
screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity was not needed in this Phase I study. 
The results of this study are summarised in Table 2.

2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview on the pre-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology is adequate. 
A valid justification for not submitting a full ERA was given. The estimated PECsurfacewater of 0.001 μg/L for 
carglumic acid in UCEDANE 200 mg, dispersible tablets is approximately 10-fold below the action limit of 0.01 
μg/L as defined in the ‘EMA Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
Use(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010)’ and thus it was agreed that no further evaluation of the environmental 
toxicity is needed. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP agreed that there are no objections to approval of Ucedane from a non-clinical point of view.

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for tablets containing carglumic acid. To support the marketing authorisation application 
the applicant conducted bioequivalence study with a cross-over design under fasting conditions. This study 
was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
In the initial application, which included a hybrid application for an additional strength of 50 mg tablets, the 
applicant claimed that a bioequivalence study would not be required as the general biowaiver criteria for the 
new strength were met. The CHMP however considered that the applicant would have to provide appropriate 
in vitro dissolution data, and also demonstrate linear pharmacokinetics between the two strengths. The 
applicant elected not to pursue this and instead chose to withdraw the hybrid application for the 50 mg 
tablets.  
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the EMA Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 Cor**) as well as the EMA Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09), the EMA Carglumic acid dispersible tablets 200 mg product-specific 
bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/315238/2014) and Question number 10 of the Questions & Answers: 
Positions on specific questions addressed to the Pharmacokinetics Working Party EMEA/618604/2008 Rev13 
are of particular relevance.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study.

Methods 
This  was  a  single  oral  dose,  randomised,  open-label,  two-way  cross-over,  bioequivalence  study  in  healthy 
male and female subjects conducted at a single study centre in the EU. Subjects were randomised to one of 
two  treatment  sequences  (AB  or  BA)  and  received  Treatment  A  (test)  and  Treatment  B  (reference)  in  two 
different treatment periods (Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2). 
Study design  
This  was  a  single  oral  dose,  randomised,  open-label,  two-way  cross-over,  bioequivalence  study  in  healthy 
male and female subjects conducted at a single study centre in the EU. Subjects were randomised to one of 
two treatment sequences (AB or BA)  and received Treatment A and Treatment B in two different treatment 
periods (Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2). 
The study consisted of screening (Day -28 to Day -2; 28 days before Treatment Period 1 Day -1); Treatment 
Period 1 (admission on the morning of Day -1, study medication administration on Day 1, and discharge on 
Day 3); Treatment Period 2 (admission on Day -1, study medication administration on Day 1, and discharge 
on Day 3); and follow-up (5 to 10 days after discharge from Treatment Period 2). Treatment Periods 1 and 2 
were separated by a wash-out period of at least 7 days up to a maximum of 14 days. 
Test and reference products  
Ucedane 200mg water-dispersible oral tablet manufactured by LUCANE PHARMA (batch No CPM8317) has 
been compared to Carbaglu 200mg water-dispersible oral tablet manufactured by Orphan Europe SARL 
(Batch No: CBC1402). 
Population(s) studied 
Healthy adult male and female subjects, who had given signed and dated written informed consent, aged 18 
to 45 years (both inclusive) with a body mass index of 18 to 28 kg/m2 (both inclusive) and weighing at least 
50 kg were included in the study. 
Subject disposition is summarised in Figure 2. 
In total, 18 subjects were screened and enrolled into the study. All 18 subjects completed the study. All 18 
subjects were included in both the PK population as well as the Safety population. 
Mean (range) age of subjects was of 30 years (20 to 41). Mean (range) weight and BMI of subjects were 
69.2 kg (52.3 to 88.5) and 23.48 kg/m2 (23.12 to 27.47), respectively.

Analytical methods 
The extracted samples were analyzed for Carglumic acid by LC-MS/MS. The quantitative analysis of the 
samples was carried out with interpolation of data into the linear regression calibration curve. 
The calibration curve for Carglumic acid have been constructed between peak area ratios of analytical to 
internal Standard (N-Carbamyl-L-Glutamic 1,2-13C2 Acid), and their concentration levels.  
A bioanalytical report entitled “Quantitative Determination of LUC-06 in Human Plasma from Study LUC06-
BIOEQ-2013 Using Turbo Ion Spray LC/MS/MS” was submitted by the applicant. The objective of this study 
was to determine LUC-06 concentrations in 612 samples and to perform incurred sample reanalysis (ISR). 
Repeat analyses were conducted for 20 samples for LUC-06. In accordance with the protocol at least two-
thirds of the re-assayed values were within 20.0% of the original result, based on the % Difference between 
the repeat analysis result and the mean of the two results. 
Long term stability of carglumic acid in biological matrix at -70°C was proven for a period that spanned the 
time from the first study sample collection to the completion of study sample analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Blood samples for the determination of carglumic acid in plasma were obtained at pre-determined time points 
up to 48 hours post-dose in each treatment period. The plasma concentration-time data were used to 
calculate the following pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters using non-compartmental methods: maximum 
observed concentration (Cmax), time to maximum observed concentration (tmax), area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC(0-t)), the 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-inf)), 
and apparent terminal half-life (t1/2).

Statistical methods 
Plasma carglumic acid concentrations and PK parameters were summarised by treatment using descriptive 
statistics and graphical presentations. 
Bioequivalence between treatments (LUC-06 as a 200 mg water dispersible tablets [test] and Carbaglu as a 
200 mg water dispersible tablets [reference]) was assessed using analysis of variance on log-transformed 
AUC(0-t) and Cmax. 
The 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the ratio of geometric least squares means of test and reference 
treatments were calculated for the natural log-transformed values of Cmax and AUC(0-t) for carglumic acid. 
Bioequivalence was to be concluded if these 90% CI fell within 80.00% to 125.00%. 
The analysis described above for AUC(0-t) and Cmax were repeated for AUC(0-inf). However, no conclusions 
were to be drawn with regard to bioequivalence from this analysis on AUC(0-inf). 
To determine the bioequivalence of LUC-06 (test) and Carbaglu® 200 mg water dispersible tablets 
(reference) the following assumptions were made. 
Assuming an intra-subject variability as 30% and inter-subject CV as 19% in AUC, and no difference between 
the test and reference treatments in true geometric means, 16 completing subjects in total in a cross over 
design would yield 80% power to conclude equivalence for AUC under the standard criteria for PK 
bioequivalence (90% CI for ratio of geometric means contained within the 80% to 125% interval). To 
account for an assumed 10% early withdrawal rate, 18 subjects were to be enrolled.

The results of the bioequivalence study LUC06-BIOEQ-2013 are presented in Tables 4, 5 and 6.

Safety data 
Adverse events (AE) were also recorded in the bioequivalence study described. No serious AEs, treatment-
emergent AEs (TEAEs) leading to discontinuation, or severe TEAEs were reported.  
In addition, safety laboratory parameters, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECGs) and physical 
examination were evaluated. 
Overall, TEAEs were reported by 7 (38.9%) subjects, 3 (16.7%) subjects after receiving Ucedane and 5 
(27.8%) subjects after receiving Carbaglu. With the exception of 1 subject, all subjects reported a single 
TEAE during the study, either on Ucedane or Carbaglu. The subject with more than 1 TEAE had: fatigue after 
receiving Ucedane and muscle spasms after receiving Carbaglu. Overall, most subjects had reported TEAEs in 
the System Organ Class “General Disorders and administration site conditions” (3 [16.7%] subjects) followed

by “Nervous system disorders” (2 [11.1%] subjects). Each Preferred Term was reported for only 1 (5.6%) 
subject. 
A few abnormal ECG assessments were reported but none were judged to be clinically significant by the 
Investigator. With regards to the ECG outlier values, only 1 subject had an outlier value, which was present 
at 48 hours post-dose after both treatments. 
No abnormal physical examinations were reported. 
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Ucedane is considered bioequivalent with Carbaglu. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This is a generic application for the marketing authorisation of Ucedane 200 mg tablets which was supported 
by one bioequivalence study.  
The choice of parameters, fed state and sample size for the bioequivalence demonstration are all acceptable 
for the 200mg dispersible tablets. 
Statistical evaluation of the PK parameters and the acceptance ranges for bioequivalence are in accordance 
with the bioequivalence guideline (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 Cor**). The statistical methods chosen 
were considered adequate. 
The median tmax was comparable between the two treatments (2.50 hours for Ucedane and 2.00 hours for 
Carbaglu). The range of the observed tmax was approximately the same following administration of the two 
treatments. The t1/2 was also similar between the two treatments (20.8 hours for Carbaglu and 21.3 hours 
for Ucedane). 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Ucedane 200 mg tablets are considered bioequivalent with 
Carbaglu 200 mg tablets. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The application contains an adequate review of published clinical data and bioequivalence has been shown 
between Ucedane and Carbaglu 200 mg tablets based on the presented bioequivalence study.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of carglumic acid tablets. The reference product Carbaglu is 
indicated for the treatment of hyperammonaemia due to: 
•  N-acetylglutamate synthase primary deficiency, 
• 
isovaleric acidaemia,  
•  methymalonic acidaemia,  
• 
propionic acidaemia.  
• 
However, the application for Ucedane concerns only treatment of hyperammonaemia due to N-
acetylglutamate synthase primary deficiency. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a single oral dose, randomised, open-label, two-way 
cross-over design in healthy male and female subjects conducted at a single study centre in the EU. The 
study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with 
the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as 
wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical 
methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Ucedane met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with 
Carbaglu. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and 
Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. 
Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk 
minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation

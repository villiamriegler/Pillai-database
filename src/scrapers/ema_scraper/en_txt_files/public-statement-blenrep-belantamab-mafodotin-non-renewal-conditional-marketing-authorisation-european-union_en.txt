Public statement 
Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin) 
Non-renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation in the European Union 
On 23 February 2024, the European Commission issued a decision to not renew the conditional 
marketing authorisation for Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin) in the European Union (EU). The 
marketing authorisation holder for the medicine was GlaxoSmithKline (Ireland) Limited.  
The non-renewal of the marketing authorisation follows the opinion issued by EMA’s human medicines 
committee, CHMP, which recommended to not renew the authorisation because the benefits of Blenrep 
no longer outweigh its risks. 
Further information is available in the news announcement published at the time of the CHMP opinion. 
Blenrep was granted a conditional marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU on 25 August 2020 
for the treatment of multiple myeloma.  
The European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) for Blenrep has been updated to indicate that the 
marketing authorisation is no longer valid.

Package Leaflet (PL) for the 300 mg in 2 ml pre-filled 
syringe (EU/1/18/1340/004-006) in line with the 
proposed PL for the 150 mg in 1 ml pre-filled syringe

Update the SmPC sections 4.8 and 5.1  to reflect the

29/09/2022 
SmPC and PL 
The main scope of this variation is to update sections 4.8 
result of study DX-2930-04 (HELP Study Extension: 
an open-label study to evaluate the long-term safety 
and efficacy of DX-2930 for prevention against acute 
attacks of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)). In 
addition, the MAH is taking the opportunity to include 
a refrigeration statement for the multi-pack pre-filled 
syringe in the SmPC and pre-filled syringe PIL in 
section 6.4. 
The Risk Management Plan is also updated to version 
2.2 following the completion of study DX-2930-04 
and according to GVP Module V Rev 2 Integrated 
RMP template. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
to reflect the results of Long-term safety and efficacy, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and impact on health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) of TAKHZYRO for prophylaxis to 
prevent HAE attacks obtained in an open-label uncontrolled 
HELP study extension. Safety data available from the HELP 
study extension are consistent with the safety data from 
the HELP study.  
A total of 212 adult and adolescent (≥ 12 years) subjects 
with symptomatic type I or II HAE received at least one 
dose of lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks in this study, including 
109 subjects who entered as rollover subjects from the 
HELP study. Rollover subjects, regardless of randomisation 
group in the HELP Study, received a single dose of 
lanadelumab 300 mg at study entry and did not receive 
additional treatment until the occurrence of an HAE attack. 
After the first HAE attack, all subjects received open-label 
treatment with lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks. The study also 
included 103 new or non-rollover subjects (including 19 
subjects from Phase1b study) who had a historical baseline 
attack rate of ≥1 attack per 12 weeks. The non-rollover 
subjects received lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks at study 
entry. Subjects were allowed to initiate self administration 
after receiving the first 2 doses from a health care 
professional in clinic and completing appropriate training.   
The majority of subjects (173/212; 81.6%) who were 
treated in this study completed at least 30 months of 
Page 5/13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment (either as a rollover or non-rollover subjects). 
The mean (SD) time in the HELP study extension was 29.6 
(8.20) months. The majority of subjects self-administered 
lanadelumab (60.6% of 8,018 injections).  
There was a sustained reduction in attack rates compared 
to baseline during the HELP study extension, with a similar 
response to TAKHZYRO observed in both rollover (92.4%) 
and non-rollover groups (82.0%) and an overall reduction 
rate of 87.4%. Though the magnitude of the attack rate 
reduction in the HELP study limited the potential for further 
reductions in the HELP extension study, mean attack rates 
for the rollover subjects decreased further at the time of 
the final analysis and ranged from 0.08 to 0.26 attacks per 
month. In addition, the mean (SD) percentage of attack-
free days was 97.7 (6.0)% and the mean (SD) duration of 
the attack-free period was 415.0 (346.1) days. The 
proportion of patients with a maximum attack-free period 
of 6 months or more or 12 months or more was 81.8% and 
68.9%, respectively. 
Furthermore, section 6.4 is updated to inform patients of 
precautions to storage. Patients are adviced that when one 
pre-filled syringe from a multi-pack is removed from 
refrigeration, the remaining pre-filled syringes should 
return to the refrigerator until future use when needed.

Product Characteristics.

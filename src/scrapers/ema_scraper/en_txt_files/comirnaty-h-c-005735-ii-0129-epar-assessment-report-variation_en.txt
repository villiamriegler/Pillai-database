2.  Introduction 
Comirnaty booster evaluations are ongoing in Study C4591001 (adult), Study C4591007 (pediatric), and 
C4591031 (adult and adolescent). For individuals ≥12 years of age, the BNT162b2 30-µg was selected 
following review of immunogenicity and safety data from Phase 1 of Study C4591001 as well as 
nonclinical data. This dose and construct provided the optimum combination of a favorable reactogenicity 
profile and a robust immune response likely to afford protection against COVID-19. 
For individuals <12 years of age, pediatric Study C4591007 used a Phase 1 age de-escalation strategy to 
select the most appropriate dose level of BNT162b2. Review of Phase 1 safety (primarily reactogenicity) 
and immunogenicity data led to the selection of BNT162b2 10-µg for children 5 to <12 years of age and 
3-µg for children 6 months to <5 years of age, in order to balance the best observed tolerability and 
robust immune responses. 
Clinical data from these studies, along with available real-world safety and effectiveness data, were 
previously submitted to support the current authorization of BNT162b2 as: 
Two-dose series: Conditional marketing approval was granted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
on 21 December 2020 for administration of the two-dose series of BNT162b2 30-µg to individuals 
≥16 years of age and expanded to include use in individuals ≥12 years of age on 28 May 2021; the 
indication was expanded on 25 November 2021 to include a two-dose series of BNT162b2 10-µg to 
individuals 5 through 11 years of age. Conditional marketing approval was granted on 03 November 2021 
for a manufacturing change to include an additional formulation of the vaccine that uses Tris buffer 
instead of PBS (30-µg and 10-µg dosage strengths). 
Third dose: Conditional marketing approval was granted on 05 October 2021 for a third dose of 
BNT162b2 30-µg to be administered ≥28 days after the second dose to individuals ≥18 years of age with 
severe immunocompromise and extended on 05 October 2021 to include a third dose of BNT162b2 10-µg 
Assessment report

to be administered ≥28 days after the second dose to individuals 5 to <12 years of age with severe 
immunocompromise.  
Booster: Conditional marketing approval was granted on 05 October 2021 for a booster dose of 
BNT162b2 30-µg to be administered ≥6 months after completing the primary series to individuals 
≥18 years of age, and extended on 24 February 2022 to include booster administration to individuals ≥12 
years of age.  
Current submission presents clinical data from ongoing pediatric Study C4591007, in support of a booster 
(third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg in children 5 to <12 years of age. 
3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Phase 1/2/3 Study C4591007  
Study C4591007 is the ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2/3 study including healthy 
children from 6 months to <12 years of age. The study was designed to evaluate BNT162b2 vaccination 
in an age de-escalation Phase 1 dose finding part and Phase 2/3 selected dose part, in protocol defined 
age groups: 5 to <12 years, 2 to <5 years, and 6 months to <2 years of age. 
Phase 2/3 commenced at the selected vaccine dose level, with participants randomized 2:1 to receive 
vaccine or placebo, and conducted at sites in the US, Finland, Poland, and Spain. The primary series of 
BNT162b2 was initially planned as a two-dose series; however, based on emerging clinical and real-world 
data, the protocol was amended to add a third dose at the selected dose level for each age group.  
Phase 1 and Phase 2/3 data from the 5 to <12 years of age group following the two-dose vaccine series 
were previously submitted. The current submission includes safety and immunogenicity data following a 
booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg administered to Phase 2/3 study participants 5 to <12 years of 
age.   
Unblinding Considerations 
Not applicable for children 5 to <12 years of age who, per protocol, could be unblinded to treatment 
assignment at 6 months after Dose 2 (which either preceded or coincided with timing of Dose 3 
administration). 
In general, sponsor and site personnel responsible for the ongoing conduct of Phase 2/3 Study C4591007 
remain blinded to individual randomization until a participant or study is unblinded per protocol. Serology 
samples are processed in a blinded manner by laboratory personnel. A separate (from study conduct) 
unblinded submissions team is responsible for regulatory submissions. 
Specifically, after discussion with regulatory authorities, participants 5 to <12 years of age in Study 
C4591007 originally randomized to receive two doses of BNT162b2 or placebo were eligible to be 
unblinded according to local eligibility to receive a COVID-19 vaccine available under emergency use or 
conditional marketing authorization (since October 2021); or they could be unblinded when they reached 
6 months of follow-up post-Dose 2, in accordance with the study protocol. Note that the protocol specified 
timing of booster vaccination for participants 5 to <12 years of age was ≥6 months after Dose 2); 
therefore, booster (third) doses have been administered to participants in this age group in an open-label 
manner. Participants in the study will continue to be followed in an open-label observational manner until 
the end of the study.

3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Vaccine efficacy was previously evaluated in Phase 2/3 of registrational Study C4591001 and for the 5 to 
<12 years of age population in pediatric Study C4591007. Immunogenicity data were previously 
evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of Studies C4591001 and C4591007. These data were previously 
submitted to support current indications. 
The basis of demonstrating BNT162b2 effectiveness in children is immune response data. Immunogenicity 
data include SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers against the wild-type strain and Omicron variant after a 
booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg, up to 1-month post-Dose 3. 
3.2.  Immunogenicity Endpoints 
Immunogenicity analyses were conducted for an immunogenicity set of participants based on all-available 
and evaluable immunogenicity populations. The immunogenicity set was comprised of: 
3-Dose set: included up to 130 participants who received Dose 3 and completed the 1-month post-Dose 3 
visit prior to 15 March 2022. Within this set, up to 30 participants also had blood sample collection at 1-
month post-Dose 2; sera from these participants were also analyzed for Omicron neutralization. 
2-Dose set: included up to 70 additional participants randomly selected from the previously analyzed 
Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population who were without evidence of prior infection up to 1-month 
post-Dose 2 (ie, included in the two-dose immunobridging analysis). These additional participants were 
included to ensure sufficient post-Dose 2 data for analyses. 
The Dose 2 and Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity populations included participants who received all 
doses of vaccine at the same dose level as randomized (ie, two or three doses) within the protocol 
specified window for each dose, had ≥1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result within 28-42 days 
after vaccination, and did not have any important protocol deviations impacting evaluability. 
Data were analyzed combining the available assay results from the 2-dose set and 3-dose set to evaluate 
immune responses at each time point. A separate summary for participants in the 3-dose set with assay 
results at both 1-month post-Dose 2 and 1-month post-Dose 3 was also provided. Analyses were 
conducted for participants either without, or with or without, evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 
1-month post-Dose 2 or 1-month post-Dose 3 as determined by N-binding antibody or NAAT. 
A validated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay for the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain was used to obtain 
immunogenicity data. Immunogenicity results were reported as: 
•  SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs)  
•  Geometric mean ratio (GMR) of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers  
• 
Percentages/difference in percentages of participants who achieved seroresponse  
•  Geometric mean-fold rises (GMFRs) of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers  
3.3.  Immunogenicity Analysis Methods 
Immunogenicity analyses were based on immune responses at each time point with descriptive 
comparison of immune responses at 1-month post-Dose 3 compared with immune responses at 1-month 
post-Dose 2. Results were reported as SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMTs, the GMR of the two time 
points, percentages of children with seroresponse, and as the difference in percentages of children with 
seroresponse between the two time points, as follows. 
Assessment report 
EMA/890825/2022 
Page 6/60 
 
 
 
 
GMTs: 2-sided 95% CIs for GMTs were obtained by taking log transforms of assay results, calculating the 
95% CI with reference to Student’s t-distribution, then exponentiating the confidence limits. Titers below 
LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ. 
Seroresponse: defined as achieving a ≥4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers from baseline (before 
Dose 1). If the baseline measurement was below the LLOQ, the post-vaccination measure of ≥4 × LLOQ 
was considered seroresponse. The exact 2-sided 95% CI for percentage of participants with seroresponse 
was computed using the F distribution (Clopper-Pearson).  
Comparison using two different groups of participants:  
Comparisons are made using data at 1-month post-Dose 3 (only participants in the 3-dose set 
contributed data to this time point) versus all available data at 1-month post-Dose 2 (all participants in 
the 2-dose set and the approximately 30 participants in the 3-dose set who had blood sample collection 
at 1-month post-Dose 2 contributed data to this time point). 
GMR: Calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed titers between the two 
groups of participants at the two time points and exponentiating the mean. The associated 2-sided 95% 
CIs were obtained by constructing CIs using Student’s t-distribution for the mean difference on the 
logarithm scale and exponentiating the confidence limits.  
Difference in seroresponse rate: The difference in percentages of participants who achieved seroresponse 
and the associated 2-sided 95% CI calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method were provided.  
Comparison within same set of participants (3-dose set with assay results at both time points): 
GMR: Calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed titers at the two time points 
and exponentiating the mean. The associated 2-sided 95% CIs were obtained by constructing CIs using 
1-sample Student’s t-distribution for the mean difference on the logarithm scale and exponentiating the 
confidence limits.  
Difference in seroresponse rate: The 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants who 
achieved seroresponse was calculated using an adjusted Wald interval as described by Agresti and Min 
(2005). 
Omicron Neutralization Assay 
Analyses were conducted on the Omicron neutralization subset, comprised of up to approximately 30 
participants in the 3-dose set (as defined above) who had blood sample collection at both 1-month post-
Dose 2 and 1-month post-Dose 3. Analyses were conducted for participants either without, or with or 
without, evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1-month post-Dose 3 as determined by N-binding 
antibody or NAAT results.  
A fluorescent focus reduction neutralization test (FFRNT)i,ii was used to determine SARS-CoV-2 serum 
neutralizing titers at 1-month post-Dose 2 and 1-month post-Dose 3. The FFRNT is a non-validated assay 
similar to the 50% plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay which has been used to generate 
confirmatory data against the reference strain and other variants.iii,iv The FFRNT assay has higher 
throughput and correlates well with the PRNT assay. All samples were tested at the same time to ensure 
comparability of results.  
Briefly, 50% FFRNT titers were determined against the designated wild-type reference strain which is a 
recombinant USA-WA1/2020 (clinical strain isolated in January 2020), and against the B.1.1.529 Omicron 
variant which is a recombinant virus with the Omicron variant full spike gene on the genetic background 
of USA-WA1/2020. FFRNT GMTs were obtained and the GMR was calculated as described above for

Within the immunogenicity set, some participants had blood draws available for immunogenicity testing 
at either the 1-month post-Dose 2 or 1-month post-Dose 3 time points, but not necessarily both. The use 
of the 2-dose set, and 3-dose set was to ensure adequate blood draws and analyzed samples to 
determine both post-Dose 2 and post-Dose 3 immune responses.  
The Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity population included 115 children 5 to <12 years of age who 
received a booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg, of whom 67 participants were without prior evidence 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 (Table 2). The number of participants without prior 
infection was impacted by the Omicron wave that overlapped with Dose 3 administration. Exclusions from 
the Dose 3 evaluable population applied to a total of 8 participants (4.2%), most due to lack of a valid 
and determinate assay immunogenicity result after Dose 3 (4.9%).

Table 2.  Immunogenicity Populations – Phase 2/3 – Immunogenicity Set – 5 to <12 Years of Age 
Vaccine Administration and Timing 
In the 3-dose set, most participants (94.6%) received Dose 3 of BNT162b2 10-µg (Table 3). Within this 
set, 7 participants (5.4%) who were 5 to <12 years of age at the time of study enrollment turned 
12 years of age during the study during or after the BNT162b2 10-µg two-dose primary series vaccination 
period, then received BNT162b2 Dose 3 at the age-appropriate dose level of 30-µg. These participants 
were excluded from all further analyses reported herein, which were intended to evaluate a booster 
(third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg only. 
All participants who received Dose 3 of BNT162b2 10-µg got the booster dose ≥7 months after Dose 2, 
most commonly between 8 and 9 months post-Dose 2 (69.9%). The total range for timing of Dose 3 
administration after Dose 2 was within 7 to 9 months.

Demographics 
Demographics of the Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 of BNT162b2 10-µg), which was comprised of 67 participants, are 
included in Table 4. 
In total, most participants in this population were White (74.6%), with 6.0% Black or African American 
participants, 6.0% Asian participants, and 13.4% multiracial participants. There were 13.4% 
Hispanic/Latino participants. The median age was 8.0 years and 52.2% of participants were male. There 
were 4.5% of participants reported as obese, and 25.4% with comorbidities at baseline and/or obesity.  
In the Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity population (regardless of evidence of prior infection), 5/115 
participants (4.3%) were baseline positive for evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Titers – Reference Strain 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer data for Phase 2/3 participants 5 to <12 years of age who received a 
booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg are summarized below for the Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity 
population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
Results in the Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity population (regardless of evidence of prior infection) and 
the Dose 3 all-available immunogenicity population were generally similar, noting there are differences in 
sample sizes between the analysis sets and noting that higher titers were observed when individuals with 
prior evidence of infection were included in the analysis. 
Analysis data include the total evaluable immunogenicity population, comprised of the combined 2-dose 
set (participants who completed the 1-month post-Dose 2 visit) and 3-dose set (participants who 
completed the 1-month post-Dose 3 visit). Additionally, data are presented for participants in the 3-dose 
set who had assay results at both post-Dose 2 and post-Dose 3.

Immunogenicity Set – 5 to <12 Years of Age – Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) – Reference Strain 
Among the total set of participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection (across the combined 2-dose set and 3-dose set), there was a substantial increase 
in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 after Dose 3 compared 
to before Dose 3 (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The observed GMTs increased from pre-vaccination of 20.5 
(n=146) to 1253.9 at 1-month post-Dose 2 (n=96), had waned to 271.0 by the time of booster 
vaccination prior to receipt of Dose 3 (n=67), and were substantially boosted to 2720.9 at 1-month post-
Dose 3 (n=67).  
Note that the total of available titers across the combined 3-dose and 2-dose sets in Table 5 was the 
basis of further analyses of GMFR, GMR, and differences in seroresponse rates. 
Among 17 participants without prior evidence of infection in the 3-dose set with assay results at both 1-
month post-Dose 2 and at 1-month post-Dose 3, the GMTs at 1-month post-Dose 2, pre-Dose 3, and 1-
month post-Dose 3 were 1685.7, 234.9, and 2611.8, respectively (Table 6).

Geometric Mean Fold-Rise (GMFR) in Titers – Reference Strain 
Among 67 participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection, the GMFR of SARS-CoV-2 50% serum neutralizing titers from Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 
was 10.0 (2-sided 95% CI: 8.1, 12.4).  
In the evaluable immunogenicity population (regardless of evidence of prior infection; n=112), the GMFR 
from Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 was 6.2 (2-sided 95% CI: 5.0, 7.6); and in the all-available 
immunogenicity population (n=115) the GMFR from Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 was 6.2 (2-sided 
95% CI: 5.1, 7.7). In these populations, the inclusion of participants with prior infection with SARS-CoV-
2, who typically have a higher pre-Dose 3 titer, appears to slightly blunt the overall fold-rise in titers after 
vaccination, noting that the observed GMTs were substantially elevated at 1-month post-Dose 3 
regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 status.  
Geometric Mean Ratio (GMR) of Neutralizing Titers – Reference Strain 
The ratio of neutralizing titers available at 1-month post-Dose 3 versus titers available at 1-month 
post-Dose 2 for the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior infection were 
summarized based on:  
1-month post-Dose 3 group results: n=67 who received a booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg and 
were without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1-month post-Dose 3.  
1-month post-Dose 2 group results: n=96 regardless of receiving a booster or not and were without 
evidence of infection up to 1-month post-Dose 2.

The GMR comparing 1-month post-Dose 3 to 1-month post-Dose 2 was 2.17 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.76,

Among 17 participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 3-dose set with assay

Among the total set of participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection (across the combined 2-dose set and 3-dose set), the observed proportion of 
participants who achieved seroresponse in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers at 1 month after Dose 2 
(n=96) was 100.0% (Table 9). The observed seroresponse rate had waned to 77.6% by the time of 
booster vaccination prior to receipt of Dose 3 (n=67) and was then substantially increased at 1-month 
post-Dose 3 (n=67) to 98.5%.  
Among 17 participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 3-dose set with assay 
results at both 1-month post-Dose 2 and at 1-month post-Dose 3, the observed proportions of 
participants with seroresponse at 1-month post-Dose 2, pre-Dose 3, and 1-month post-Dose 3 were 
100.0%, 70.6%, and 100.0%, respectively (Table 10).

Difference in Seroresponse Rate – Reference Strain 
The difference in proportions of participants achieving seroresponse with titers available at 1-month post-
Dose 3 versus titers available at the 1-month post-Dose 2 for the evaluable immunogenicity population 
without evidence of prior infection were summarized based on: 
1-month post-Dose 3 group results: n=67 who received a booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg and 
were without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1-month post-Dose 3.  
1-month post-Dose 2 group results: n=96 regardless of receiving a booster or not and were without 
evidence of infection up to 1-month post-Dose 2. 
Seroresponse was achieved by 98.5% of participants 1-month post-Dose 3 and by 100.0% of participants 
at 1-month post-Dose 2. The difference in seroresponse rates (1 month after Dose 3 – 1 month after 
Dose 2) was -1.5% (2-sided 95% CI: -8.0%, 2.4%) (Table 11).

Among 17 participants in the 3-dose set with assay results at both 1-month post-Dose 2 and at 1-month 
post-Dose 3, the difference in seroresponse rates was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -10.3%, 10.3%) (Table

SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Titers – Omicron Variant 
FFRNT data for Phase 2/3 participants 5 to <12 years of age who received a booster (third) dose of 
BNT162b2 10-µg are summarized below for the evaluable immunogenicity population of participants 
without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This included n=29 with assay results available at 1-

month post-Dose 2 and without evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, and n=17 with assay 
results and without evidence of infection up to 1-month post-Dose 3.  
Results in the evaluable immunogenicity population (regardless of evidence of prior infection) and the all-
available immunogenicity population were generally similar, noting that higher titers were observed when 
individuals with prior evidence of infection were included in the analysis. 
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) 
The neutralizing GMTs against both the Omicron variant and reference strain were substantially increased 
after booster vaccination compared with after the two-dose primary series (Table 13). At 1-month post-
Dose 2, the observed neutralizing GMTs for the Omicron variant and reference strain were 27.6 and 
323.8, respectively. At 1-month post-Dose 3, the observed neutralizing GMTs for the Omicron variant and 
reference strain were 614.4 and 1702.8, respectively. 
For the Omicron variant, neutralizing titers after booster vaccination (1-month post-Dose 3) increased 
22-fold over those after the two-dose primary series (1-month post-Dose 2). For the reference strain, the 
increase after the booster relative to the primary series was 5-fold. 
Geometric Mean Ratios (GMRs) 
The GMR of neutralizing titers against Omicron versus the reference strain was increased after booster 
vaccination (1-month post-Dose 3) relative to after the two-dose primary series (1-month post-Dose 2) 
(Table 14) as follows. 
1-month post-Dose 2: GMR of titers against the Omicron variant vs reference strain was 0.09 (2-sided 
95% CI: 0.07, 0.10). 
1-month post-Dose 3: GMR of titers against the Omicron variant vs reference strain was 0.36 (2-sided 
95% CI: 0.28, 0.47). 
The GMRs show a fold-rise from 1-month post-Dose 2 to 1-month post-Dose 3 that was 4-times higher 
for the Omicron titers than for the reference strain titers obtained in the FFRNT assay.

3.5.  Immunogenicity Discussion 
Study C4591007 is the ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2/3 study including healthy 
children from 6 months to <12 years of age. The dose selection of Phase 1 show that the suitable dose of 
Comirnaty for 5 to <12 years is 10-µg. In Phase 2/3 the participants randomized 2:1 to receive vaccine 
or placebo, and conducted at sites in the US, Finland, Poland, and Spain. The primary series of BNT162b2 
was initially planned as a two-dose series; however, based on emerging clinical and real-world data, the 
protocol was amended to add a third dose. The participants could be unblinded to treatment assignment 
at 6 months after Dose 2. 
The protocol specified timing of booster vaccination for participants 5 to <12 years of age was ≥6 months 
after Dose 2); therefore, booster (third) doses have been administered to participants in this age group in 
an open-label manner. Participants in the study will continue to be followed in an open-label observational 
manner until the end of the study which is acceptable.

The basis of demonstrating BNT162b2 effectiveness in children is immune response data which is 
acceptable. Immunogenicity data include SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers against the wild-type strain and 
Omicron variant after a booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg, up to 1-month post-Dose 3. 
The immunogenicity set was comprised of: 
3-Dose set: included up to 130 participants who received Dose 3 and completed the 1-month post-Dose 3 
visit prior to 15 March 2022. Within this set, up to 30 participants also had blood sample collection at 1-
month post-Dose 2; sera from these participants were also analyzed for Omicron neutralization. This 3-
dose set came exclusively from US. 
2-Dose set: included up to 70 additional participants randomly selected from the previously analyzed 
Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population who were without evidence of prior infection up to 1-month 
post-Dose 2 (ie, included in the two-dose immunobridging analysis). These additional participants were 
included to ensure sufficient post-Dose 2 data for analyses. About 30 % of 2-dose set came from EU and 
70 % from US.  
Immunogenicity results were reported as in previous Comirnaty authorization studies: 
•  SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs)  
•  Geometric mean ratio (GMR) of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers  
• 
Percentages/difference in percentages of participants who achieved seroresponse  
•  Geometric mean-fold rises (GMFRs) of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers  
A validated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay for the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain was used, but for 
Omicron variant, unvalidated assay FFRNT was used, which may affect the robustness of the data 
obtained. The MAH answered that non-validated assays have been used also earlier. 
Analyses were conducted for participants either without, or with or without, evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection up to 1-month post-Dose 2 or 1-month post-Dose 3 as determined by N-binding antibody or 
NAAT. As the pandemic has been evolved, the study population without evidence of previous SARS-COV-2 
infection has been decreased. In addition, there was not many blood samples available from post-dose 1 
and 2. This resulted in reduced sample size. The biological variability to respond to vaccine is wide 
especially after booster dose, therefore it is needed multiple observations to ensure the representability 
of the results for general population. Therefore at least 50 subjects per group is desirable. Currently too 
few observations in post-dose 2 demonstrate the biological variability of immune response in 3-dose set 
(US N=29) compared to the 2 dose-set (US+EU N=67). The GMT values which are expected to be very 
similar do not have even overlapping CI, see below excerpt from table 4.

To avoid confusion, we recommend not to present GMT separately for 2 and 3 dose sets. The MAH agreed 
with simplified presentation of the results. 
There were only 17 subjects, who had no signs of SARS-COV-2 during entire study period, had received 
all 3 vaccinations in correct time frame and had all blood samples available after each vaccination. This is

very limited cohort. These subjects were tested to evaluate neutralizing antibodies against Wuhan strain 
using validated neutralization and also non-validated FFRNT assay for both Wuhan and Omicron strains. 
A validated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay and unvalidated FFRNT assay show antibody rise 2 vs 3 
doses for Wuhan strain, but the values differ a lot. The observed differences in GMT ratios can not be 
attributable only for the small sample size and high variability of immunological responses, but is a sign 
that the assays do not have a good agreement, see below excerpts from table 8 and 13.

Due to the limited sample size and unvalidated FFRNT assay we recommend removing the text in SmPC 
describing 3rd dose impact on Omicron variant neutralization. The MAH still will add a summary 
statement to the SMPC, which can be agreed with. 
The booster dose induced neutralizing titres against the omicron BA.1 strain which were approx. 1.9-fold 
higher than those observed after primary vaccination against the index strain (GMT 614 versus 323). As 
the BA.1 omicron lineage has been replaced by BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 lineages, it would be of interest 
to confirm that the immunogenicity of the booster dose as documented by titres against the no longer 
circulating BA.1 remain valid/true for the currently circulating BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 lineages. This 
can be done by using the children sera from the immunobridging trial to perform in vitro neutralization 
assays against omicron BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 lineages to allow a comparison between omicron 
subspecies. 
The MAH was therefore asked to provide a plan and timelines for the availability of data regarding other 
omicron VOCs i.e. BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5. The MAH answered that Neutralization of Omicron sublineages, 
including BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/BA.5 has been evaluated in sera from the phase 1 participants 23 to 
74 years of age in the C4591001 pivotal study. BNT162b2 post-Dose 3 immune sera neutralized USA-
WA1/2020, Omicron BA.1-, BA.2-, BA.2.12.1-, BA.3-, BA.4/5-, and XD-spike SARS-CoV-2s with 
geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 1335, 393, 298, 315, 216, 103, and 301, respectively; thus, BA.4/5 
SARS-CoV-2 spike variant showed the highest propensity to evade vaccine neutralization compared to the 
original Omicron variants BA.1. As neutralization trends against the reference strain (USA-WA-1/2020) 
and Omicron BA.1 have been consistent across age groups (adults and 5-11-year olds), we would 
anticipate similar trends against the Omicron sublineages as shown in Kuhade et al. 
Testing is not planned in the 5-11-year-old age group as data in this age group have been consistent with 
what has been observed in the adult population. 
Generally, all the immunological results showed that higher neutralising titres are obtained after the third 
dose compared to the second dose of Comirnaty 10 µg among children ages 5 to below 12. This is 
expected result as demonstrated earlier for adults with Comirnaty 30 µg. Also, the neutralising titres had 
declined before the third dose compared to 1 month after dose 2, as can be expected. The seroresponse 
rate was almost 100% after 3rd dose. There was one non-responder observed with very low GMT values 
after 3 doses. This was unexpected, but do not negatively affect the booster authorization. 
The main immune responses were the following: 
Assessment report 
EMA/890825/2022

In an evaluable immunogenicity population of 67 children 5 to <12 years of age who were without 
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection the following immunogenicity responses were observed:  
GMTs at 1-month post-Dose 3 were increased (2720.9) compared with those at 1-month post-Dose 2 
(1253.9) and prior to booster (Dose 3) vaccination (271.0).  
The GMR for participants with available titers at 1-month post-Dose 3 compared to those with available 
titers at 1-month post-Dose 2 was 2.17 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.76, 2.68).  
The observed proportion of participants who achieved seroresponse was high (100.0%) at 1-month post-
Dose 2, waned by pre-Dose 3 (77.6%), and was increased at 1 month after Dose 3 (98.5%).  
Based on the unvalidated FFRNT assay, a booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg elicited neutralizing 
titers against a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and recombinant wild-type (reference) strain of 
SARS-CoV-2 in an evaluable immunogenicity population of 29 children 5 to <12 years of age who were 
without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
The observed 1-month post-Dose 2, neutralizing GMTs for the Omicron variant and reference strain were 
27.6 and 323.8, respectively which increased at 1-month post-Dose 3 to 614.4 and 1702.8 and, 
respectively, representing an increase from post-two-dose primary series to post-booster vaccination of 
22-fold for Omicron and 5-fold for the reference strain. 
The immune response associated with a booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg administered 
approximately 6 months after the second dose to children 5 to <12 years of age is expected to confer 
protection against COVID-19 including disease caused by Omicron.  
Taking into consideration the current SmPC recommendations in individuals 12 years of age and older, 
the MAH is invited to consider the minimum boosting interval. MAH did not change their statement, that 
booster should be administered after 6 months from dose 2 in this young age group and this issue is not 
pursued further. 
4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
4.1.  Introduction 
The safety database constitutes of interim data from a phase 1/2/3 study (C4591007) including children 
aged 5-<12 years of age that have received a booster dose (third dose) of BNT162b 10 µg. The study 
was conducted at 68 sites, which included sites in Finland (11), Poland (8), Spain (10), and the US (39). 
The Phase 2/3 was initiated 7 June 2021, and the database lock point for this interim analysis is 22 March 
2022. All Phase 2/3 participants were to be unblinded at the 6-month follow-up visit, per protocol. The 
booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-μg was to be administered at least 6 months after the second dose, 
after participants were to be unblinded, therefore in an open-label manner. 
Reactogenicity: Local reactions, systemic events, and antipyretic/pain medication use was recorded each 
evening for 7 days after each dose administration using prompts from an electronic diary (e-diary). 
Grading scales were based on FDA guidance.  
Adverse Events: AEs were collected from Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 and serious AEs (SAEs) are 
collected from Dose 3 to 6 months after Dose 3. AEs are categorized by frequency, maximum severity, 
seriousness, and relationship to study intervention using system organ class (SOC) and preferred term 
(PT) according to MedDRA. Deaths are recorded to the end of study.

Inclusion/Exclusion criteria: Enrolled into Phase 2/3 of this study were healthy participants who were 
determined by medical history, physical examination, and clinical judgment of the investigator to be 
eligible for inclusion in the study in the protocol specified age groups. Eligibility permitted enrolment of 
participants with medical conditions such as stable Type 1 diabetes or hypothyroidism; stable and 
controlled HIV, HCV, or HBV infection; and past serological or microbiological evidence of prior (not 
active) SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants’ parent(s)/legal guardian(s) had to provide signed inform 
consent (and verbal or written assent from the participant if appropriate); they also had to be willing and 
able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and 
other study procedures. Exclusions from Phase 2/3 study participation included prior receipt of a COVID-
19 vaccine or medication intended to prevent COVID-19, prior or current diagnosis of MIS-C, history of 
severe (i.e., anaphylactic) reaction associated with any vaccine or allergy to any component of the study 
intervention (i.e., BNT162b2), immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease requiring therapeutic 
intervention (other than diabetes) and other medical conditions and/or therapeutic interventions deemed 
incompatible with study participation. 
4.2.  Methods  
4.2.1.  Disposition 
All participants included in the safety population received Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 as illustrated in the 
table below. One protocol deviation was reported for one participant (0.2%) who had an important 
protocol deviation of incorrect vaccine allocation/assigned. This participant was randomized to placebo 
but received two doses of BNT162b2 10-μg and a booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-μg. 
All participants included in the safety population received Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 (Table 15). As of 
the data cut-off date (22 March 2022), 77.6% of participants 5 to <12 years of age who received Dose 3 
of BNT162b2 10-μg completed the visit at 1 month after Dose 3. No participants discontinued from the 
vaccination period or were withdrawn from the study as of the data cut-off date (22 March 2022).

All participants who received Dose 3 of BNT162b2 10-μg received the booster dose ≥5 months after Dose 
2, most commonly between 8- and 9-months post-Dose 2 (86.8%). The total range for timing of Dose 3 
administration after Dose 2 was 5 to 9 months. Subjects that turned 12 years of age (n=24) received 
30µg and where therefore excluded. The safety population analysed for Phase 2/3 participants 5 to <12 
years of age who received a booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-μg included N=401. No participants in 
the safety population were HIV+. No participants were excluded from the safety population for any 
reason.

Systemic events 
Fatigue was the most frequently reported systemic event reported within 7 days after each dose, followed 
by headache, and less frequently muscle and joint pain (Figure 4). In general, these events were reported 
at similar or slightly higher frequencies after Dose 3 compared with after Dose 2. Most systemic events 
were mild or moderate in severity. Severe systemic events were reported infrequently after each dose 
(≤2%). Severe systemic events reported after Dose 3 included fatigue (n=7 [1.9%]), headache (n=3 
[0.8%]), chills (n=1 [0.3%]), and diarrhoea (n=1 [0.3%]). No Grade 4 events were reported after any 
dose. No participants reported a fever >40.0 °C after Dose 3. The median onset for most systemic events 
after any dose of BNT162b2 10-μg was 1 to 2 days, and most events resolved within a median duration 
of 1 day after onset.

This analysis through the cut-off date accounts for a median of 1.3 months of follow-up post-Dose 3 (up 
to a maximum of 1.8 months post-Dose 3). 
Overall, any AEs were reported by 9.0% of participants from Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3. Many of the 
AEs were consistent with reactogenicity events that were reported as AEs (e.g., injection site pain, 
headache, and fatigue). AE frequencies in SOCs capturing reactogenicity events included: 
•  General disorders and administration site conditions: 2.2% 
•  Gastrointestinal disorders: 1.5% 
•  Nervous system disorders: 1.0% 
•  Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: 0.5% 
In addition to reactogenicity events, most other events reported were infections, illnesses, and injuries 
typically observed in this age group. Additionally, AEs of clinical interest included cases of 
lymphadenopathy (including palpable lymph node or axillary mass) which were reported in 10 
participants (2.5%), and rash which was reported in 1 participant (0.2%).

A participant in the 5 to 11 year age group had a fever of 102.2° F (39.0° C) with onset at 1-day 
post-Dose 3, in addition to concurrent AEs of mild dizziness and mild arthralgia (bilateral legs) 
that all had an onset of 1-day post-Dose 3 and resolved within 3 days with the use of concomitant 
medication. This participant also previously had a fever reported in the e-diary after Dose 2, with 
a duration of 2 days (body temperatures of 39.7° C and 40.3° C on Day 2 and Day 3, 
respectively). 
Serious Adverse Events 
No SAEs were reported from Dose 3 up to the data cut-off date (22 March 2022) 
Death 
No deaths were reported up the data cut-off date (22 March 2022). 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
Based on previous FDA requests for information on AEs of clinical interest in prior submissions, the 
following MedDRA Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ) were applied to search the safety data: 
Angioedema, Arthritis, Convulsions, Demyelination, Hypersensitivity, Peripheral Neuropathy, and 
Vasculitis. There were no PTs associated with these SMQs in children 5 to <12 years of age, except for 1 
case of rash (Hypersensitivity SMQ) which is summarized below. 
Additionally, from the analysis of AEs (Table 24), there were no AEs of clinical interest reported of 
anaphylaxis, myocarditis, pericarditis, Bell’s palsy (or facial paralysis/paresis), or appendicitis. Other 
notable pertinent negatives (i.e., no cases reported in this population as of the data cut-off for this 
submission) included (but were not limited to): arthritis, thrombocytopenic events, thromboembolic or 
intravascular coagulation events, autoimmune or demyelination events, meningitis, encephalitis, neuritis, 
peripheral neuropathy, vasculitis, Kawasaki disease, MIS-C, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The 
only AE of clinical interest in this safety dataset was lymphadenopathy, which is summarized below: 
Lymphadenopathy 
Lymphadenopathy is considered an adverse reaction to this vaccine and is noted as such in the product 
labelling.  
From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 10 cases of lymphadenopathy (including palpable lymph node or 
axillary mass) were identified, representing 2.5% of the safety population (Table 24). This frequency of 
lymphadenopathy after Dose 3 of BNT162b2 10-μg in children 5 to <12 years of age is higher than 
previously observed after Dose 2 (0.9%), and less than that observed following Dose 3 of BNT162b2 30-
μg in adults ≥18 years of age (5.2%). Overall, all cases of lymphadenopathy reported after Dose 3 of 
BNT162b2 10-μg were mild and considered by the investigator as related to study intervention; most of 
these cases were identified as occurring in axillary or cervical nodes, had an onset within 2 days of 
booster vaccination, and were reported as resolved within approximately 1 week after onset. 
Rash 
Rash is considered an adverse reaction to this vaccine and is noted as such in the product labelling.  
From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 1 participant (0.2%) reported a rash after booster vaccination. The 
mild face rash was considered by the investigator as unrelated to study intervention, was attributed to 
face mask wearing, and had onset at 11 days post-Dost 3 and resolution within 4 days after onset.

Serious cases of note 
Out of the 18 serious cases, 5 cases where the seriousness criterion was reported as Hospitalization 
Required or Death are summarized below. 
- 
Fatal case (1 consumer case received through the Regulatory Authority) 
The fatal case, from a non-contactable consumer, refers to a patient in an EU country in the 5 to 11 years 
age group and contains very little information.  This child was reported to have received a dose of 
BNT162b2 as a booster dose (PTs: Off label use, Product administered to patient of inappropriate age), 
after a primary series from an unknown manufacturer.  Dyspnoea occurred 69 days after the booster 
dose; the child died on an unknown date due to dyspnoea.  It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. 
The report was assessed as Unclassifiable by PEI. 
-  Myocarditis (2 Health Care Professional cases received through the Regulatory 
Authority) 
•  A patient in an EU country in the 5-to-11-year age group received a dose 3 (0.3 mL) of 
BNT162b2.  Three (3) days later, while exercising, the child experienced sudden precordial chest 
pain associated with breathlessness lasting 30 minutes. The child was hospitalised for myocarditis 
and several non-serious clinical events (Troponin abnormal, Hyperaemia, Chromaturia, Protein 
urine present, Urine ketone body present, pH urine increased, Sinus arrhythmia, Left ventricular 
hypertrophy, Electrocardiogram abnormal and Blood urine present) were reported.  Myocarditis 
resolved after 1 day.  It was also reported but not elaborated on that “a possible minimal 
myocardial rupture” occurred with onset in the same month of the booster dose, resolved quickly 
and spontaneously and was thought to be related to sports. Medical history and concomitant 
medications were not reported. 
•  A patient in an EU country in the 5-to-11-year age group received a booster dose of BNT162b2 21 
days after a primary series from an unknown manufacturer.  Probable subclinical myocarditis (PT 
Myocarditis) and Troponin increased were reported on an unknown date; Chest pain with 
Dyspnoea were reported 10 days after the booster dose and Chest pain and Palpitations were 
reported 13 days after the booster dose. No other patient detail was provided (ie, diagnostic 
tests, medical history, concomitant medications, course of the event). The patient recovered at 
the time of the reporting. 
-  Guillain-Barre syndrome (1 consumer case) 
6 Including 1 case with fatal outcome (Off label use, Immunisation, Dyspnoea, Product administered to patient of inappropriate 
age), 1 case of Myocarditis; 8 cases of Drug ineffective/Vaccination failure and COVID-19/ Suspected COVID-19; 1 case of 
Guillain-Barre syndrome, 2 cases indicative of swelling (Bone swelling/Parotid gland enlargement and Axillary pain/Swelling), 
and 1 case each of Lymphadenopathy, Syncope and Pyrexia/Abdominal pain. 
7 There were 4 unlocked serious cases, part of cluster of 5 cases coding the PTs Product administration error, Poor quality

-  Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (1 consumer case received through the 
Regulatory Authority) 
•  A patient in an EU country in the 5-to-11-year age group (details on medical history and 
concomitant medication not provided), received as booster dose 0.3 mL of BNT162b2 after a 
primary vaccination series from an unknown manufacturer. The same day of the administration of 
the booster dose, the child developed Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) and was 
hospitalised; Rash and Pyrexia occurred 23 days after the booster dose. The following non-serious 
PTs were also reported, with an unknown onset date and clinical outcome: Abdominal pain, 
Fatigue and Pallor. Rash and pyrexia resolved after treatment with intravenous immune globulin, 
prednisolone and acetylsalicylic acid.  MIS-C was reported as resolved on an unknown date. The 
report was assessed as Unclassifiable by PEI. 
MAH Conclusion 
Review of the cumulative available post-marketing data in individuals aged 5 to less than 12 years, did 
not identify any additional or unexpected risks associated with administration of BNT162b2 and is 
consistent with the favorable benefit risk balance observed in the clinical study. Post-marketing 
surveillance activities will continue. 
4.4.2.  The number of administered and distributed booster doses and 
observed AEs  
It is not possible to discriminate how many doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine paediatric tris-sucrose 
presentation (10 micrograms/dose) out of 4,331,200 shipped to the US between 17 May 2022 and 22 
June 2022 were administered as primary series or as booster doses in individuals aged 5 to less than 12 
years. 
Considering that up to now BNT162b2 was the only vaccine authorized in the US as a booster in 
individuals aged 5 to less than 12 years, as per the information available at the US CDC COVID Data 
Tracker,8 it is estimated that 497,632 individuals aged 5 to less than 12 years had received a booster 
dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in the US as of 22 June 2022. These publicly available data may be more 
indicative of the actual exposure in persons compared to the shipped doses, however it should be noted 
that these data may also be incomplete.  
4.5.  Discussion 
The safety database constitutes of 401 subjects aged 5-<12 years of which a vast majority received their 
booster dose 8-9 months post dose 2 (87%). Based on this data, the MAH has proposed that the booster 
dose should be administered at least six months after dose 2. None of the participants were excluded 
from the safety population for other reasons. Local and systemic reactogenicity was recorded for 7 days 
after each dose administration using an electronic diary (e-diary). AEs were collected from Dose 3 to 1 
month after Dose 3 and serious AEs (SAEs) are collected from Dose 3 to 6 months after Dose 3.

Duration of follow up was 1-2 months for all 401 subjects. Reactogenicity data after dose 3 is available 
for 371 subjects. According to the MAH, there were technical issues in activation of the e-diary after dose 
3, and therefore data from Day 1 is only available in 244 of the subjects. It is noted that the there is a 
significantly lower response rate in the e-diary after dose 3 compared to dose 1 and 2 due to technical 
issues with the e-diary, where about 25% of individuals do not have entries in the e-dairy from day 1 up 
to day 7 resulting in only 36.2% of the participants having a complete record for all 7 days.  
The most common local reaction was pain at injection site (74%), which is in line with what has been 
observed for dose 2. Most of the local reactions were mild to moderate in intensity. One severe event of 
redness and two severe events of pain at injection site were reported after dose 3.  
Fatigue (46%), followed by headache (34%) was the most commonly reported systemic reaction after 
dose 3. Fever was reported in 7%, of which 3 subjects reported a body temperature >38.9oC, thus 
classified as severe. No grade 4 events were reported after dose 3. One event of diarrhoea, one event of 
chills, three events of headache and 7 events of fatigue were classified as severe.  
Antipyretic pain medication was used by 31%, which is a higher frequency compared to dose 2 (22%) 
and dose 1 (13%). 
For AEs, the follow up time covers a median of 1.3 months post-dose 3. The AE profile is overall 
acceptable and consistent with the known side effect profile of Comirnaty. AEs were reported by overall 
9.0% of participants from Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3. AEs were in the majority consistent with 
reactogenicity events, belonging to the SOCs “General disorders and administration site conditions” 
(2.2%), “Gastrointestinal disorders” (1.5%), “Nervous system disorders” (1.0%) and “Musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders” (0.5%). To mention are also cases of lymphadenopathy, reported in 10 
participants (2.5%), and rash, reported in 1 participant (0.2%). No immediate AEs were reported within 
30 minutes of receiving Dose 3 of BNT162b2 10 µg. 
Related AEs (4,7%) belong as well to the group of reactogenic events and reflect the known side effect 
profile of the vaccine, with events such as injection site pain, pyrexia, lymphadenopathy and diarrhoea. 
No SAEs, life threatening events or deaths were reported. One severe AE (pyrexia of 39.0C in a 
participant in the 5- to 11-year-old age group) was reported one day post-dose 3, which resolved within 3 
days. 
The MAH performed a search on AESIs and detected only two PTs to mention: (1) lymphadenopathy as 
observed in 10 participants and, thus, higher in frequency (2.5%) than after dose 2 (0.9%) (overall mild 
in severity, resolving approximately 1 week after onset) and (2) rash as observed in 1 participant 11 days 
after booster vaccination (mild face rash which was considered unrelated to vaccination by the study 
physician due to alternative explanation (face mask wearing)). 
It is noted that FDA has recently approved booster dose for children aged 5-<12 years, the MAH has 
provided available post-marketing safety data (cut off date 10 July 2022) in relation to the use of a 
booster dose in this population. 
Overall, the side effect profile after booster dose is consistent with the safety profile known for primary 
series of Comirnaty 10 µg administered to individuals aged 5-<12 years of age. 
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC of COMIRNATY 10 μg are being updated.

1. 
Due to the changed COVID-19 epidemiological situation along with the very transmittable omicron 
variants, many children have now experienced SARS-COV-2 infection. This has caused a reduction 
of the SARS-COV-2 naïve population. At the same time, MAH have had limited blood sample 
collection for immunogenicity evaluation after Dose 1 and 2. Due to these reasons the sample 
size for immunogenicity populations to evaluate dose 3 are smaller than expected. We suggest 
describing in SmPC only through “Total” population GMT values as it is confusing with different 
immunogenicity sets with small sample size and unexpected statistically significant different 
values between 2-dose set and 3- dose set after 1 month post dose 2.

The Omicron neutralization data after dose 3 relies on 17 subjects and is measured using a non-
validated assay. Therefore, please remove this chapter in SmPC. 
The booster dose induced neutralizing titres against the omicron BA.1 strain which were approx. 
1.9-fold higher than those observed after primary vaccination against the index strain (GMT 614 
versus 323). As the BA.1 omicron lineage has been replaced by BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 
lineages, it would be of interest to confirm that the immunogenicity of the booster dose as 
documented by titres against the no longer circulating BA.1 remain valid/true for the currently 
circulating BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 lineages. This can be done by using the children sera from 
the immunobridging trial to perform in vitro neutralization assays against omicron BA.2.12.1, 
BA.4 and BA.5 lineages to allow a comparison between omicron subspecies. 
The MAH is therefore asked to provide a plan and timelines for the availability of data regarding 
other omicron VOCs i.e. BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5.

The Omicron neutralization data after dose 3 relies on 17 subjects and is measured using a non-validated 
assay. Therefore, please remove this chapter in SmPC  
Summary of the MAH’s response: The Omicron neutralization data was a descriptive analysis in a subset 
of participants, which demonstrated a substantial increase in Omicron neutralizing titers after Dose 3, 
similar to observations in adults. Prior descriptive analyses have used a similar non-validated assay for 
characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variant neutralization. Pfizer and BioNTech accept the deletion of text and

the HCP. 
New statement in SmPC:  
Using a non-validated fluorescence focus reduction neutralization test assay against the Omicron variant 
of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.529), the NT50 GMT at 1 month after the booster dose among a subset of 17 study 
participants (614.4 [95% CI: 410.7, 919.2]) was increased compared to the NT50 GMT at 1 month after 
dose 2 among a subset of 29 study participants (27.6 [95% CI: 22.1, 34.5]). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The summary statement in SmPC is not acceptable. According to ETF input, data obtained with an 
unvalidated assay should be removed. 
The MAH have updated the SmPC accordingly by removing the omicron statement from the SmPC 
accordingly. 
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Question 3 
The booster dose induced neutralizing titres against the omicron BA.1 strain which were approx. 1.9-fold 
higher than those observed after primary vaccination against the index strain (GMT 614 versus 323). As 
the BA.1 omicron lineage has been replaced by BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 lineages, it would be of interest 
to confirm that the immunogenicity of the booster dose as documented by titres against the no longer 
circulating BA.1 remain valid/true for the currently circulating BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 lineages. This 
can be done by using the children sera from the immunobridging trial to perform in vitro neutralization 
assays against omicron BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 lineages to allow a comparison between omicron 
subspecies. 
The MAH is therefore asked to provide a plan and timelines for the availability of data regarding other 
omicron VOCs i.e. BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Administration of a booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg elicited robust neutralizing titers against the 
wild-type variant of SARS-CoV-2 in an evaluable immunogenicity population of 67 children 5 to <12 years 
of age who were without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Robust neutralizing GMTs were observed at 
1-month post-Dose 3 that were substantially increased (2720.9) compared with those at 1-month post-
Dose 2 (1253.9) and prior to booster (Dose 3) vaccination (271.0). 
A supportive analysis using a fluorescent focus reduction neutralization test assay evaluated neutralizing 
GMTs against a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and recombinant wild-type (reference) strain 
in an evaluable immunogenicity population of 29 children 5 to <12 years of age who were without 
evidence of prior SARS
CoV
2 infection and had assay data available at both 1-month post-Dose 2 and 
1
month post-Dose 3. At 1-month post-Dose 2, the neutralizing GMTs for the Omicron variant and 
‑
reference strain were 27.6 and 323.8, respectively. By 1
‑
‑
month post-Dose 3, the neutralizing GMTs for 
Omicron and reference were 614.4 and 1702.8, respectively, representing a substantial 22-fold increase 
for the recombinant Omicron variant and from the post-two-dose primary series (1-month post-Dose 2 
‑
data) to post-booster vaccination, as well as a 5-fold for the recombinant reference strain.

Neutralization of Omicron sublineages, including BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/BA.5 has been evaluated in 
sera from the phase 1 participants 23 to 74 years of age in the C4591001 pivotal study. BNT162b2 post-
Dose 3 immune sera neutralized USA-WA1/2020, Omicron BA.1-, BA.2-, BA.2.12.1-, BA.3-, BA.4/5-, and 
XD-spike SARS-CoV-2s with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 1335, 393, 298, 315, 216, 103, and 301, 
respectively; thus, BA.4/5 SARS-CoV-2 spike variant showed the highest propensity to evade vaccine 
neutralization compared to the original Omicron variants BA.1. As neutralization trends against the 
reference strain (USA-WA-1/2020) and Omicron BA.1 have been consistent across age groups (adults and 
5-11-year olds), we would anticipate similar trends against the Omicron sublineages as shown in Kuhade 
et al.v 
Testing is not planned in the 5-11-year-old age group as data in this age group have been consistent with 
what has been observed in the adult population. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response: The answer is acceptable. Neutralization against other lineages 
including currently circulation Omicron BA4/5 is expected to be lower than against Wuhan or Omicron 
BA1. 
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Question 4 
Taking into consideration the current SmPC recommendations in individuals 12 years of age and older, 
the MAH is invited to consider the minimum boosting interval.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The sponsor acknowledges the comment; however the data supports a dosing interval of at least 6 
months from the primary series to the booster dose. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response: Agreed with MAH to recommend for a booster an interval at least 
6 months from dose 2  
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Safety 
Question 1 
According to the MAH, there were technical issues in activation of the e-diary after dose 3, and therefore 
data from Day 1 is only available in 244 of the subjects. It is noted that the there is a significantly lower 
response rate in the e-diary after dose 3 compared to dose 1 and 2, where about 25% of individuals do 
not have entries in the e-dairy from day 1 up to day 7 resulting in only 36.2% of the participants having a 
complete record for all 7 days. The MAH is requested to further explain these considerably lower numbers 
and the discrepancy in reporting between primary series and booster dose. 
Assessment report 
EMA/890825/2022 
Page 51/60 
 
 
 
 
 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The technical issue in app activation was identified after the initiation of Dose 3 implementation for which 
only 32 out of the entire 425 participants included did not complete the e-diary for all 7 days due to this 
issue. Protocol deviations were reported for these participants. Given the limited impact, the compliance 
issues noted above are not reflective of this technical issue. Although the overall 7 days compliance was 
lower than Dose 1 and 2, the daily compliance for Dose 3 remained above 75% from Day 2 onwards. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The lower response rate after dose 3 compared to dose 1 and 2 is according to the MAH due to technical 
issue with the e-diary system after dose 3. It would of course have been of value with to have access to 
all possible data, especially in limited study size as this. However, the response rate was at about 75% 
from D2.  
The issue is not pursued. 
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance 
Question 2 
According to the MAH, 311 individuals out of 401 individuals (77%) completed the 1-month post-dose 
visit, but in the tables where AEs as observed 1 month after booster vaccination are presented the MAH 
refers to all 401 individuals. The MAH is requested to explain this discrepancy. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Adverse events were summarized for the safety population which included all participants who received 
the booster dose. Among the 401 participants in the safety population, 311 completed a 1-month post-
Dose visit by the cutoff date. Of note, although there were 90 participants that didn’t complete the 1-
month post-Dose visit by the cutoff date, they all received the booster dose at least 1 month prior to the 
cutoff date and remained in the study. The AE summary included all AEs reported up to the 1-month 
post-Dose visit for the 311 participants who completed 1-month post-Dose visit and all available AEs 
reported up to the cutoff date for the 90 participants who didn’t complete the 1-month post-Dose visit by 
the cutoff date. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The answer of the MAH is accepted. Issue resolved. 
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

Serious cases of note 
Out of the 18 serious cases, 5 cases where the seriousness criterion was reported as Hospitalization 
Required or Death are summarized below. 
- 
Fatal case (1 consumer case received through the Regulatory Authority) 
The fatal case, from a non-contactable consumer, refers to a patient in an EU country in the 5- to 11-
year-old age group and contains very little information.  This child was reported to have received a dose 
of BNT162b2 as a booster dose (PTs: Off label use, Product administered to patient of inappropriate age), 
after a primary series from an unknown manufacturer.  Dyspnoea occurred 69 days after the booster 
dose; the child died on an unknown date due to dyspnoea.  It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. 
The report was assessed as Unclassifiable by PEI. 
-  Myocarditis (2 Health Care Professional cases received through the Regulatory 
Authority) 
•  A patient in an EU country in the 5- to 11-year-old age group received a dose 3 (0.3 mL) of 
BNT162b2.  Three (3) days later while exercising, the child experienced sudden precordial chest 
pain associated with breathlessness lasting 30 minutes. The child was hospitalised for myocarditis 
and several non-serious clinical events (Troponin abnormal, Hyperaemia, Chromaturia, Protein 
urine present, Urine ketone body present, pH urine increased, Sinus arrhythmia, left ventricular 
13 Including 1 case of Myocarditis and 1 case of Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. 
14 Including 1 case with fatal outcome (Off label use, Immunisation, Dyspnoea, Product administered to patient of 
inappropriate age), 1 case of Myocarditis; 8 cases of Drug ineffective/Vaccination failure and COVID-19/ Suspected COVID-19; 
1 case of Guillain-Barre syndrome, 2 cases indicative of swelling (Bone swelling/Parotid gland enlargement and Axillary 
pain/Swelling), and 1 case each of Lymphadenopathy, Syncope and Pyrexia/Abdominal pain. 
15 There were 4 unlocked serious cases, part of cluster of 5 cases coding the PTs Product administration error, Poor quality 
product administered; these cases were re-assessed as non-serious cases after the DLP.

hypertrophy, Electrocardiogram abnormal and Blood urine present) were reported.  Myocarditis 
resolved after 1 day.  It was also reported but not elaborated on that “a possible minimal 
myocardial rupture” occurred with onset in the same month of the booster dose, resolved quickly 
and spontaneously and was thought to be related to sports. Medical history and concomitant 
medications were not reported. 
•  A patient in an EU country in the 5- to 11-year-old age group received a booster dose of 
BNT162b2 21 days after a primary series from an unknown manufacturer.  Probable subclinical 
myocarditis (PT Myocarditis) and Troponin increased were reported on an unknown date; Chest 
pain with Dyspnoea were reported 10 days after the booster dose and Chest pain and Palpitations 
were reported 13 days after the booster dose. No other patient detail was provided (ie, diagnostic 
tests, medical history, concomitant medications, course of the event). The patient recovered at 
the time of the reporting. 
-  Guillain-Barre syndrome (1 consumer case) 
•  An individual of unknown gender in an Asian/Pacific country in the 5- to 11-year-old age group 
received a booster dose (dose number unknown) with BNT162b2 after a primary series from an 
unknown manufacturer; medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an 
unknown date the child was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome and was hospitalised. 
Diagnostic studies and clinical details were not provided and the clinical outcome was unknown. 
-  Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (1 consumer case received through the 
Regulatory Authority) 
•  A patient in an EU country in the 5- to 11-year-old age group (details on medical history and 
concomitant medication not provided), received as booster dose 0.3 mL of BNT162b2 after a 
primary vaccination series from an unknown manufacturer. The same day of the administration of 
the booster dose, the child developed Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) and was 
hospitalised; Rash and Pyrexia occurred 23 days after the booster dose. The following non-serious 
PTs were also reported, with an unknown onset date and clinical outcome: Abdominal pain, 
Fatigue and Pallor. Rash and pyrexia resolved after treatment with intravenous immune globulin, 
prednisolone and acetylsalicylic acid.  MIS-C was reported as resolved on an unknown date. The 
report was assessed as Unclassifiable by PEI. 
MAH Conclusion 
Review of the cumulative available post-marketing data in individuals aged 5 to less than 12 years, did 
not identify any additional or unexpected risks associated with administration of BNT162b2 and is 
consistent with the favorable benefit risk balance observed in the clinical study. Post-marketing 
surveillance activities will continue. 
b. Both the number of administered and distributed booster doses and observed AEs should be described 
and evaluated 
It is not possible to discriminate how many doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine paediatric tris-sucrose 
presentation (10 micrograms/dose) out of 4,331,200 shipped to the US between 17 May 2022 and 22 
June 2022 were administered as primary series or as booster doses in individuals aged 5 to less than 12 
years. 
Considering that up to now BNT162b2 was the only vaccine authorized in the US as a booster in 
individuals aged 5 to less than 12 years, as per the information available at the US CDC COVID Data 
Assessment report

Tracker,16 it is estimated that 497,632 individuals aged 5 to less than 12 years had received a booster 
dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in the US as of 22 June 2022. These publicly available data may be more 
indicative of the actual exposure in persons compared to the shipped doses, however it should be noted 
that these data may also be incomplete.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
In total has 119 post-marketing cases been reported and submitted by the MAH. The majority of the 
cases fell in the categories Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (160 events), General 
disorders and administration site conditions (52 events). 
Two events of myocarditis have been reported in two children in the 5- to 11-year-old age group, one 
case developed ten days and the other three days after administration of booster vaccination. For the 
case reported three days after booster dose laboratory workup (including abnormal troponin) has been 
presented, however, medical history is missing. The case that occurred 10 days after booster vaccination 
lacks details of description of medical history and clinical presentations which limits the possibility to 
assess causality. Both cases resolved. In both cases possible confounding factors cannot be properly 
excluded limiting firm conclusion on causality. Myocarditis is already described in section 4.4 and 4.8 of 
the SmPC.  
One case of Guillain-Barré has been reported from an Asian/Pacific country, medical history and the exact 
type of vaccine is unknown. Thus, the case cannot be firmly evaluated. 
One case of MIS-C was reported based on a consumer report submitted to the Agency. The case is 
described as MIS-C that developed the same day as vaccination, no results of clinical or laboratory 
evaluations have been provided. Therefore, causality cannot be assessed due to the limited information. 
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance 
8.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
BNT162b2 10 µg is administered intramuscularly (IM) as a primary series of two doses given 3 weeks 
apart to individuals ≥5 years of age. According to the present label, booster doses may be administered 
to severely immunocompromised individuals ≥5 years of age. 
This application seeks an extension of the indication to all children 5 to <12 years, for a booster (third) 
dose of BNT162b2 10-µg. 
The application is based on clinical data from Study C4591007 Phase 2/3 demonstrating the safety and 
tolerability in approximately 400 children. Moreover, data include immune responses from a subset of 
approximately 130 participants against the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type reference in approximately 130 
participants, as well as responses against the Omicron BA1 variant in approximately 30 participants. 
Follow up is for at least 1-month post-Dose 3 f.

Study C4591007 is the ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2/3 study including healthy 
children from 6 months to <12 years of age. The dose selection of Phase 1 shows that the suitable dose 
of Comirnaty for 5 to <12 years is 10-µg. 
In Phase 2/3 the participants randomized 2:1 to receive vaccine or placebo, The study was conducted at 
sites in the US, Finland, Poland, and Spain. The participants could be unblinded to treatment assignment 
at 6 months after Dose 2. 
The protocol specified timing of booster vaccination for participants 5 to <12 years of age was ≥6 months 
after Dose 2; therefore, booster (third) doses have been administered to participants in this age group in 
an open-label manner. Participants in the study will continue to be followed in an open-label observational 
manner until the end of the study which is acceptable. 
The basis of inferring BNT162b2 effectiveness in children is immune response data. Immunogenicity data 
include SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers against the wild-type strain and the Omicron BA1. variant after a 
second dose and booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 10-µg, up to 1-month post-Dose 3. Immunological 
response after 3 doses vs. 2 doses of Comirnaty was compared. Descriptive analysis of GMTs, GMR and 
seroresponse in 2 dose group and 3 dose group were presented. No statistical hypothesis of superior or 
non-inferior immune response was studied. 
As the pandemic has evolved, the study population without evidence of previous SARS-COV-2 infection 
has decreased. In addition, there were not many blood samples available from post-dose 1 and 2. This 
resulted in a reduced sample size.  
Generally, all the immunological results showed that higher neutralising titres are obtained after the third 
dose compared to after the second dose of Comirnaty 10 µg among children ages 5 to below 12. The GMR 
for participants with available titers at 1-month post-Dose 3 (N=67) compared to those with available 
titers at 1-month post-Dose 2 (N=96) was 2.17 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.76, 2.68)).  
This is an expected result, given what was previously demonstrated for adults with Comirnaty 30 µg.  
Neutralising titres had declined before the third dose compared to 1 month after dose 2, as anticipated. 
The seroresponse rate was almost 100% after 3rd dose, using pre-dose values as reference. There was 
one non-responder observed with very low GMT values after the third dose. This is unexpected but is 
understood as an outlier which does not impact overall conclusions.  
A validated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay for the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain was used for the 
primary analysis. However, for the Omicron BA1. variant, an unvalidated assay FFRNT was used, which 
may affect the robustness of the data obtained. In addition, the samples size was lower than expected for 
immunogenicity analysis for Omicron variant (N=17). Given study conduct, data are considered 
descriptive rather than inferential. The immune response associated with a booster (third) dose of 
BNT162b2 10-µg administered approximately 6 months after the second dose to children 5 to <12 years 
of age is expected to confer protection against severe COVID-19 including severe disease caused by 
Omicron.  
In conclusion, essentially descriptive data support the assumption based on the boosting of older 
individuals, of the benefit of a third dose given at approximately 6 months after the primary series, in 
terms of restoring immunity.  
The safety database constitutes of 401 subjects aged 5-<12 years of which a vast majority received their 
booster dose 8-9 months post dose 2 (87%). Based on this data, the MAH has proposed that the booster 
dose should be administered at least six months after dose 2, which is the recommended dose interval 
described in section 4.2 of the SmPC and considered acceptable.

None of the participants were excluded from the safety population for other reasons. Local and systemic 
reactogenicity was recorded for 7 days after each dose administration using an electronic diary (e-diary). 
AEs were collected from Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 and serious AEs (SAEs) are collected from Dose 
3 to 6 months after Dose 3. 
Duration of follow up was 1-2 months for all 401 subjects. Reactogenicity data after dose 3 is available 
for 371 subjects. It is noted that a significant lower number of subjects reported solicited events in the e-
diary system, however, at least 75% of the subjects reported in the e-diary from day 2 and onwards. 
Reactogenicity profile was in line with had been observed for primary series in this population. The most 
common local reaction was pain at injection site (74%). Most of the local reactions were mild to moderate 
in intensity. Fatigue (46%), followed by headache (34%) was the most commonly reported systemic 
reaction after dose 3.  
Antipyretic pain medication was used by 31%, which is a higher frequency compared to dose 2 (22%) 
and dose 1 (13%) The frequency of fever was not higher after dose 3 (9% dose 2; 7% dose 3), but a 
slightly increase of reported headache (30% dose 2; 34% dose 3) and muscle pain (13% dose 2; 18% 
dose 3) might explain the increased use of antipyretic pain medication 
AEs were covered for a median of 1.3 months post-dose 3. The AE profile is overall acceptable and 
consistent with the known side effect profile of Comirnaty and belonged especially to the SOCs “General 
disorders and administration site conditions” (2.2%), “Gastrointestinal disorders” (1.5%), “Nervous 
system disorders” (1.0%) and “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” (0.5%). Notably, 
lymphadenopathy was reported in 10 participants (2.5%, a higher frequency than observed after dose 2 
(0.9%)), and rash (not related to study product) in 1 participant (0.2%). No immediate AEs were 
reported within 30 minutes of receiving Dose 3 of BNT162b2 10 µg. No SAEs, life threatening events or 
deaths were reported. One severe AE (pyrexia of 39.0C in a participant in the 5 to 11 years old age 
group) was reported one day post-dose 3, which resolved within 3 days. 
It is noted that FDA has recently approved a booster dose for children aged 5-<12 years, and the MAH 
has submitted available post-marketing safety data in relation to the use of a booster dose in this 
population. 
Overall, the side effect profile after booster dose is consistent with the safety profile known for primary 
series of Comirnaty 10 µg administered to individuals aged 5-<12 years of age. 
The benefit-risk balance of COMIRNATY remains positive.

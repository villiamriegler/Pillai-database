Study number: 10PN-PD-DIT-063 
Study title: A phase III, controlled, single-blind study to assess the reactogenicity, safety and 
immunogenicity of a booster dose of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ 10-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine or Prevenar™ when co-administered with Hiberix™ at 12-18 months of age in 
children primed with the same vaccines in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036 
  Description 
This study was conducted by 14 principal investigators in Korea.  
  Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary: 
• 
To assess the reactogenicity of a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in terms of the 
occurrence of adverse events (AEs) with grade 3 intensity, when co-administered with Hiberix 
at 12-18 months of age in children primed with the same vaccines at 2, 4 and 6 months of age 
in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036. 
Secondary: 
• 
• 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine when co-
administered with Hiberix at 12-18 months of age in children primed with the same vaccines at 
2, 4 and 6 months of age in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036. 
To assess the immunogenicity of a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine when co-
administered with Hiberix at 12-18 months of age in children primed with the same vaccines at 
2, 4 and 6 months of age in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036. 
Study design 
• 
This was a phase III, multi-centre, single-blind, controlled study with 2 parallel groups: 
  10Pn group: subjects previously primed with 3 doses of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine and 
with Hiberix in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036 and receiving a booster dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT 
and Hiberix at 12-18 months of age. 
  Prev group: subjects previously primed with 3 doses of Prevenar and with Hiberix in 
study 10PN-PD-DIT-036 and receiving a booster dose of Prevenar and Hiberix at 12-18 
months of age. 
•  Control: Prev group.

Page 2/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Vaccination schedule: a booster dose of either 10Pn-PD-DiT or Prevenar co-administered with 
Hiberix at 12-18 months of age. 
•  One blood sample was collected one month post-booster vaccination. 
• 
Type of study: booster vaccination study of primary vaccination study 10PN-PD-DIT-036. 
Study population /Sample size 
Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion: 
•  Subjects for whom the investigator believed that their parent(s)/guardian(s) could and would 
comply with the requirements of the protocol. 
•  Male or female between, and including, 12-18 months of age at the time of the booster 
vaccination. 
•  Subjects who received three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in study 10PN-PD-DIT-
036. 
•  Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s) or guardian(s) of the child/ward. 
•  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into 
the study. 
The sample size was contingent on the number of subjects who received three doses of pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036. Assuming that around 20% of these subjects did not 
enter this study, it could be considered that approximately 400 subjects (300 in group 10Pn and 100 
subjects in group Prev) received the booster dose of study vaccines. 
This sample size had at least 80% power to detect a difference between the considered 10Pn group 
and Prev group in terms of percentage of subjects with grade 3 adverse event.  
Treatments 
The formulations for the 10Pn-PD-DiT, Hiberix and Prevenar vaccines are in Table 3.

Statistical analyses were performed according to the protocol. 
Demography: 
•  Demographic characteristics (age in months, gender, race) of each study cohort were tabulated 
• 
as a whole and per group. 
The mean age in months (plus range and standard deviation) of the enrolled subjects, as a 
whole, and per group, was calculated. 
•  Distribution of enrolled subjects among the study centres was tabulated as a whole and per 
• 
group. 
In addition, a summary of the tracking log-sheet that documented outcomes of the contacts 
made with subjects for enrolment in this study was provided. 
Safety /reactogenicity: 
Descriptive analysis: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The number and percentages of subjects reporting solicited and/or unsolicited local and 
general adverse events during the 31-day (Days 0-30) follow-up period after booster 
vaccination was calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI), according to the type of 
symptom, the intensity and relationship to vaccination. 
The number and percentages of subjects reporting each local and each general solicited 
symptom reported during the 4-day (Days 0-3) follow-up period after booster vaccination was 
calculated with 95% CI, according to the type of symptom, the intensity and relationship to 
vaccination. 
The number and percentages of subjects with an unsolicited symptom reported within the 31-
day (Days 0-30) follow-up period after booster vaccination were classified according to the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), with 95% CI according to the intensity 
and relationship to vaccination. 
The proportion of AEs resulting in a medically attended visit was also be tabulated. 
Prevalence of concomitant antipyretic/medication during the 4-day (Days 0-3) follow-up period 
after booster vaccination was computed with 95% CI. 
•  Serious adverse events, large swelling reactions and withdrawal due to serious adverse 
event(s) were described in detail. 
Immunogenicity: 
Descriptive analysis: 
•  Geometric mean antibody concentrations/titres (GMCs/GMTs), seropositivity/seroprotection 
rates were calculated with their 95% CI for each group, each antigen/serotype, one month 
post-booster vaccination. 
•  Distribution of antibody concentrations/titres was displayed using tables and/or reverse 
cumulative curves for each group, each antigen/serotype, one month post-booster vaccination.

Fifty three subjects (37 from the 10Pn group and 16 from the Prev group) did not participate in the 
booster vaccination study for the following reasons: 
•  18 subjects (12 in the 10Pn group and 6 in the Prev group) were not eligible. 
•  19 subjects (15 in the 10Pn group and 4 in the Prev group) were lost to follow-up. 
•  6 subjects (4 in the 10Pn group and 2 in the Prev group) did not fill in a tracking document (so 
missing information for them). 
•  10 subjects (6 in the 10Pn group and 4 in the Prev group) did not want to participate (not 
because of AE or SAE). 
•  Baseline data 
Demography: 
In the Total vaccinated cohort, the mean age at booster vaccination was 13.6 months (standard 
deviation of 1.05), 99.8% of subjects were Asian (East Asian heritage) and 50.7% of subjects were 
female. 
Efficacy results 
Immunogenicity: 
Immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort (primary analysis) and on the Total 
vaccinated cohort. The immunogenicity results for the Total vaccinated cohort were consistent with 
those for ATP cohort for immunogenicity. 
Booster immune response to the pneumococcal antigens - descriptive analysis results: 
•  One month post-booster vaccination, for each of the 7 common serotypes contained in 10Pn-
PD-DiT and Prevenar, at least 97.5% of subjects in the 10Pn group and at least 98.0% of 
subjects in the Prev group had antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 μg/mL. For each of the 3 
additional serotypes (1, 5, 7F), the observed percentage of subjects in the 10Pn group with 
antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 μg/mL was 100% for serotype 5 and 99.7% for serotypes 1 and 
7F. 
•  A trend towards higher antibody GMCs was observed one month post-booster vaccination 
compared to the post-primary vaccination in both groups, for each of the serotypes for which 
subjects were primed. 
•  One month post-booster vaccination, the observed antibody GMCs were higher in the Prev 
group compared to the 10Pn group (no overlap of 95% CIs) for each of the 7 common 
serotypes except for serotype 18C and 19F. For serotype 18C, the antibody GMC was in the 
same range in both groups and for serotype 19F, the antibody GMC was higher in the 10Pn 
group compared to the Prev group (no overlap of 95% CI). This trend was consistent with what 
was observed in the primary vaccination study 10PN-PD-DIT-036.

subjects in the Prev group had OPA titres ≥ 8. For each of the 3 additional serotypes (1, 5, 7F), 
at least 94.6% of subjects in the 10Pn group had OPA titres ≥ 8. 
• 
•  A trend towards higher OPA GMTs or comparable OPA GMTs (for serotype 5 and 6B in the 10Pn 
group) was observed one month post-booster compared to post-primary vaccination in both 
groups for each of the serotypes for which subjects were primed. 
The observed post-booster OPA GMTs were higher in the Prev group compared to the 10Pn 
group (no overlap of 95% CIs) for each of the 7 common serotypes except for serotype 19F for 
which OPA GMT was higher in the 10Pn group compared to the Prev group (no overlap of 95% 
CI). This trend was consistent with what was observed in the primary vaccination study 10PN-
PD-DIT-036.

•  One month post-booster vaccination, 99.4% of subjects had measurable anti-protein D 
antibodies concentrations (≥ 100 EL.U/mL) in the 10Pn group. A trend towards lower anti-
protein D antibody GMC was observed post-booster vaccination compared to post-primary 
vaccination in the 10Pn group. 
Booster immune response to the co-administered Hib polysaccharide PRP antigen - descriptive analysis 
results 
One month post-booster vaccination, all subjects in both groups had seroprotective anti-PRP antibody 
concentrations (≥1.0 μg/mL). A trend toward higher anti-PRP antibody GMCs was observed in the 10Pn 
group compared to the Prev group. 
Safety results 
The safety analysis was performed on the Total vaccinated cohort (primary analysis) and on the ATP 
cohort. The results for the ATP cohort for safety were in line with those for the Total vaccinated cohort. 
Overall incidence of adverse events: 
•  During the 31-day post-booster vaccination period, 76.8% and 77.9% of subjects in the 10Pn 
and Prev groups respectively reported at least one AE (solicited and unsolicited, local and 
general). 
•  Regarding the primary endpoint, 12.7% and 11.5% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev groups 
respectively reported at least one grade 3 AE (solicited and unsolicited, local and general). 
Local grade 3 AEs (11.4% and 10.6% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev groups respectively) 
tended to be more frequent than general grade 3 AEs (2.1% and 1.8% of subjects in the 10Pn 
and Prev groups respectively). 
Solicited local adverse events: 
•  Redness was the most frequently reported solicited local AE during the 4-day post-booster 
vaccination period in both groups (42.8% of subjects in the 10Pn group and 48.7% in the Prev 
group). 
•  Observed incidences of any solicited local AEs were within the same ranges in both groups. 
• 
Low incidences of grade 3 pain and swelling were reported, ranging from 0.0% (for pain) to 
4.2% (for swelling), whatever the group. Although grade 3 redness seemed to be reported 
more frequently, the incidences were within the same range in both groups (9.0% and 10.6% 
of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev groups, respectively). 
Four subjects reported large swelling reactions following booster vaccination (all in the 10Pn 
group). Two of the four large swelling reactions were reported at the Hiberix injection site and 
2 at the 10Pn- PD-DiT injection site. All the large swelling reactions were localized swelling at 
the injection site, not involving the adjacent joints and all resolved without sequelae.

Solicited general adverse events: 
• 
Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general AE in both groups (42.5% of 
subjects in the 10Pn group and 37.2% in the Prev group). 
•  Observed incidences of any solicited general AEs were within the same ranges in both groups. 
•  A low incidence of grade 3 solicited general AEs was reported and ranged from 0.0% to 1.8% 
(for irritability) whatever the group. Grade 3 fever (axillary temperature > 39.5°C) was 
reported by one subject in the Prev group.  
Note: Tympanic measurement was the preferred route of temperature measurement. The 
statistical tables are standardized and present the axillary measurement. From the point of 
view of the validity of data, temperature values measured using tympanic route are considered 
equivalent to those measured using the axillary route. 
•  A low incidence of grade 3 solicited general AEs considered as causally related to vaccination 
by the investigator, was reported and ranged from 0.0% to 1.5% (for irritability) whatever the 
group. 
Unsolicited adverse events: 
•  Upper respiratory tract infection was the most frequently reported unsolicited AE in both 
groups.  
•  35.2% and 36.3% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev groups, respectively, reported at least one 
unsolicited AE.

•  3.6% and 4.4% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev groups, respectively, reported at least one 
unsolicited AE considered by the investigator to be causally related to the vaccination. 
•  Only one subject (0.3%) in the 10Pn group reported a grade 3 unsolicited AE (i.e. vomiting) 
which was considered by the investigator to be causally related to the vaccination. 
Serious adverse events: 
•  No fatal events were reported during the study period. 
• 
Twelve subjects reported at least one SAE during the study period: 8 out of 335 vaccinated 
subjects (2.4%) in the 10Pn group and 4 out of 113 vaccinated subjects (3.5%) in the Prev 
group. 
•  None of the reported SAEs were considered by the investigator to be causally related to 
vaccination and all SAEs resolved without sequelae. 
Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events: 
No subject was withdrawn from the study due to a non-serious AE or a SAE. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
MAH Conclusions: 
• 
• 
• 
The observed incidences of grade 3 AEs (solicited and unsolicited, local and general) as well as 
the incidences of any solicited local and general AEs were within the same ranges in both 
groups. 
Incidences of reported grade 3 local symptoms, ranged from 0.0% (for pain) to 10.6% (for 
redness), whatever the group. 
Low incidences of grade 3 solicited general AEs were reported, ranging from 0.0% to 1.8% 
whatever the group. No grade 3 fever (axillary temperature > 39.5°C) was reported in 
subjects boosted with 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine. 
•  Only one subject (0.3%) in the 10Pn group reported a grade 3 unsolicited AEs, which was 
considered by the investigator to be causally related to the vaccination. 
•  8 out of 335 vaccinated subjects (2.4%) in the 10Pn group and 4 out of 113 vaccinated 
subjects (3.5%) in the Prev group reported at least one SAE during the study period. None of 
the reported SAEs were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination and 
all SAEs resolved without sequelae. No fatal events were reported during the entire study 
period. 
•  One month post-booster vaccination, in the group boosted with 10Pn-PD-DiT, at least 97.5% of 
subjects had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 μg/mL and at least 94.6% of subjects had OPA 
titres ≥8 for each of the 10 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes. These percentages were at least 
98.0% and 97.7% of subjects in the group boosted with Prevenar for each of the 7 common 
pneumococcal serotypes. 
The observed antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs were higher for subjects boosted with Prevenar 
compared to 10Pn-PD-DiT (no overlap of 95% CIs), for each of the 7 common pneumococcal 
serotypes except for serotype 18C (for which the antibody GMC was in the same range in both 
groups) and 19F (for which the antibody GMC and OPA GMT were higher in subjects boosted 
with 10Pn-PD-DiT compared to Prevenar). This trend was consistent with what was observed in 
the primary vaccination study 10PN-PD-DIT-036. 
• 
•  One month post-booster vaccination, 99.4% of subjects boosted with 10Pn-PD-DiT had 
• 
• 
measurable anti-protein D antibody concentrations (≥100 EL.U/mL). 
In both groups, all subjects reached seroprotective anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥1.0 
μg/mL, one month post-booster vaccination. 
The 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine was immunogenic and well tolerated when given as a booster 
(fourth) dose at 12-18 months of age co-administered with Hiberix in Korean children primed 
with the same vaccines.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
ORENCIA, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: 
 
the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who 
responded inadequately to previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX) or a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha 
inhibitor. 
the treatment of highly active and progressive disease in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
not previously treated with methotrexate. 
 
A reduction in the progression of joint damage and improvement of physical function have been 
demonstrated during combination treatment with abatacept and methotrexate. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
ORENCIA, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients when the response to previous DMARD therapy including 
MTX has been inadequate, and for whom additional systemic therapy for psoriatic skin lesions is not 
required. 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
ORENCIA in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe 
active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in paediatric patients 6 years of age and older 
who have had an inadequate response to previous DMARD therapy. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ORENCIA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when treatment with 
methotrexate is inappropriate. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or pJIA. 
If a response to abatacept is not present within 6 months of treatment, the continuation of the treatment 
should be reconsidered (see section 5.1). 
Posology 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Adults 
To be administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at the dose specified in Table 1. Following the 
initial administration, ORENCIA should be given 2 and 4 weeks after the first infusion, then 
every 4 weeks thereafter.

No dose adjustment is required when used in combination with other DMARDs, corticosteroids, 
salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or analgesics. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Adults 
To be administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at the dose specified in Table 1. Following the 
initial administration, ORENCIA should be given 2 and 4 weeks after the first infusion, then 
every 4 weeks thereafter. 
Paediatric population 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
The recommended dose of ORENCIA for patients 6 to 17 years of age with polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis who weigh less than 75 kg is 10 mg/kg calculated based on the patient’s body 
weight at each administration. Paediatric patients weighing 75 kg or more should be administered 
ORENCIA following the adult dosing regimen, not to exceed a maximum dose of 1,000 mg. 
ORENCIA should be administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. Following the initial 
administration, ORENCIA should be given at 2 and 4 weeks after the first infusion and every 4 weeks 
thereafter. 
The safety and efficacy of intravenous ORENCIA in children below 6 years of age have not been 
studied and therefore, intravenous ORENCIA is not recommended for use in children under six years 
old.

ORENCIA solution for injection in pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous administration is available for 
paediatric patients 2 years of age and older for the treatment of pJIA (see Summary of Product 
Characteristics for ORENCIA solution for injection in pre-filled syringe). 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 4.4). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
ORENCIA has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. 
Method of administration 
For intravenous use. 
The entire, fully diluted ORENCIA solution should be administered over a period of 30 minutes and 
must be administered with an infusion set and a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein-binding filter (pore 
size of 0.2 to 1.2 μm). For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before 
administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Severe and uncontrolled infections such as sepsis and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Combination with TNF-inhibitors 
There is limited experience with use of abatacept in combination with TNF-inhibitors (see 
section 5.1). In placebo-controlled clinical trials, in comparison with patients treated with 
TNF-inhibitors and placebo, patients who received combination TNF-inhibitors with abatacept 
experienced an increase in overall infections and serious infections (see section 4.5). Abatacept is not 
recommended for use in combination with TNF-inhibitors. 
While transitioning from TNF-inhibitor therapy to ORENCIA therapy, patients should be monitored 
for signs of infection (see section 5.1, study VII). 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions have been reported uncommonly with abatacept administration in clinical trials, 
where patients were not required to be pretreated to prevent allergic reactions (see section 4.8). 
Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions can occur after the first infusion and can be life-threatening. In 
postmarketing experience, a case of fatal anaphylaxis following the first infusion of ORENCIA has 
been reported. If any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, intravenous or subcutaneous 
ORENCIA therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated, and the use 
of ORENCIA should be permanently discontinued. 
Effects on the immune system 
Medicinal products which affect the immune system, including ORENCIA, may affect host defences 
against infections and malignancies, and affect vaccination responses. 
Co-administration of ORENCIA with biologic immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents 
could potentiate the effects of abatacept on the immune system (see section 4.5). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infections 
Serious infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, have been reported with abatacept (see 
section 4.8). Some of these infections have been fatal. Many of the serious infections have occurred in 
patients on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy which in addition to their underlying disease, 
could further predispose them to infections. Treatment with ORENCIA should not be initiated in 
patients with active infections until infections are controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when 
considering the use of ORENCIA in patients with a history of recurrent infections or underlying 
conditions which may predispose them to infections. Patients who develop a new infection while 
undergoing treatment with ORENCIA should be monitored closely. Administration of ORENCIA 
should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. 
No increase of tuberculosis was observed in the pivotal placebo-controlled studies; however, all 
ORENCIA patients were screened for tuberculosis. The safety of ORENCIA in individuals with latent 
tuberculosis is unknown. There have been reports of tuberculosis in patients receiving ORENCIA (see 
section 4.8). Patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis prior to initiating ORENCIA. The 
available medical guidelines should also be taken into account. 
Anti-rheumatic therapies have been associated with hepatitis B reactivation. Therefore, screening for 
viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with published guidelines before starting therapy 
with ORENCIA. 
Treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, such as ORENCIA, may be associated with progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If neurological symptoms suggestive of PML occur during 
ORENCIA therapy, treatment with ORENCIA should be discontinued and appropriate diagnostic 
measures initiated. 
Malignancies 
In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the frequencies of malignancies in abatacept- and placebo-
treated patients were 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively (see section 4.8). Patients with known malignancies 
were not included in these clinical trials. In carcinogenicity studies in mice, an increase in lymphomas 
and mammary tumours were noted. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown (see 
section 5.3). The potential role of abatacept in the development of malignancies, including lymphoma, 
in humans is unknown. There have been reports of non-melanoma skin cancers in patients receiving 
ORENCIA (see section 4.8). Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly 
those with risk factors for skin cancer. 
Vaccinations 
Patients treated with ORENCIA may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Live 
vaccines should not be given concurrently with abatacept or within 3 months of its discontinuation. 
Medicinal products that affect the immune system, including abatacept, may blunt the effectiveness of 
some immunisations. 
It is recommended that patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis be brought up to date with all 
immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating ORENCIA 
therapy (see section 4.5). 
Elderly patients 
A total of 404 patients 65 years of age and older, including 67 patients 75 years and older, received 
abatacept in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Similar efficacy was observed in these patients and in 
younger patients. The frequencies of serious infection and malignancy relative to placebo among 
abatacept-treated patients over age 65 were higher than among those under age 65. Because there is a 
higher incidence of infections and malignancies in the elderly in general, caution should be used when 
treating the elderly (see section 4.8). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Autoimmune processes 
There is a theoretical concern that treatment with abatacept might increase the risk for autoimmune 
processes in adults and children, for example deterioration of multiple sclerosis. In the placebo-
controlled clinical trials, abatacept treatment did not lead to increased autoantibody formation, such as 
antinuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies, relative to placebo treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.3). 
Blood glucose testing 
Parenteral medicinal products containing maltose can interfere with the readings of blood glucose 
monitors that use test strips with glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinoline quinone (GDH-PQQ). The 
GDH-PQQ based glucose monitoring systems may react with the maltose present in ORENCIA, 
resulting in falsely elevated blood glucose readings on the day of infusion. When receiving 
ORENCIA, patients that require blood glucose monitoring should be advised to consider methods that 
do not react with maltose, such as those based on glucose dehydrogenase nicotine adenine 
dinucleotide (GDH-NAD), glucose oxidase, or glucose hexokinase test methods. 
Patients on controlled sodium diet 
This medicinal product contains 34.5 mg sodium per maximum dose of 4 vials (8.625 mg sodium per 
vial), equivalent to 1.7% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Combination with TNF-inhibitors 
There is limited experience with the use of abatacept in combination with TNF-inhibitors (see 
section 5.1). While TNF-inhibitors did not influence abatacept clearance, in placebo-controlled clinical 
trials, patients receiving concomitant treatment with abatacept and TNF-inhibitors experienced more 
infections and serious infections than patients treated with only TNF-inhibitors. Therefore, concurrent 
therapy with abatacept and a TNF-inhibitor is not recommended. 
Combination with other medicinal products 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of methotrexate, NSAIDs, and 
corticosteroids on abatacept clearance (see section 5.2). 
No major safety issues were identified with use of abatacept in combination with sulfasalazine, 
hydroxychloroquine, or leflunomide. 
Combination with other medicinal products that affect the immune system and with vaccinations 
Co-administration of abatacept with biologic immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents could 
potentiate the effects of abatacept on the immune system. There is insufficient evidence to assess the 
safety and efficacy of abatacept in combination with anakinra or rituximab (see section 4.4). 
Vaccinations 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with abatacept or within 3 months of its 
discontinuation. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons 
receiving live vaccines to patients receiving abatacept. Medicinal products that affect the immune 
system, including abatacept, may blunt the effectiveness of some immunisations (see sections 4.4 and 
4.6). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exploratory studies to assess the effect of abatacept on the antibody response to vaccination in healthy 
subjects as well as the antibody response to influenza and pneumococcal vaccines in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients suggested that abatacept may blunt the effectiveness of the immune response, but did 
not significantly inhibit the ability to develop a clinically significant or positive immune response. 
Abatacept was evaluated in an open-label study in rheumatoid arthritis patients administered the 
23-valent pneumococcal vaccine. After pneumococcal vaccination, 62 of 112 abatacept-treated 
patients were able to mount an adequate immune response of at least a 2-fold increase in antibody 
titers to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. 
Abatacept was also evaluated in an open-label study in rheumatoid arthritis patients administered the 
seasonal influenza trivalent virus vaccine. After influenza vaccination, 73 of 119 abatacept-treated 
patients without protective antibody levels at baseline were able to mount an adequate immune 
response of at least a 4-fold increase in antibody titers to trivalent influenza vaccine. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy and women of childbearing potential 
There are no adequate data from use of abatacept in pregnant women. In pre-clinical embryo-foetal 
development studies no undesirable effects were observed at doses up to 29-fold a human 10 mg/kg 
dose based on AUC. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, limited changes in immune 
function were observed at 11-fold higher than a human 10 mg/kg dose based on AUC (see 
section 5.3). 
ORENCIA should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with abatacept. Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during 
treatment and up to 14 weeks after the last dose of abatacept. 
Abatacept may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with abatacept 
during pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk of infection. The safety of 
administering live vaccines to infants exposed to abatacept in utero is unknown. Administration of live 
vaccines to infants exposed to abatacept in utero is not recommended for 14 weeks following the 
mother’s last exposure to abatacept during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Abatacept has been shown to be present in rat milk. 
It is unknown whether abatacept is excreted in human milk. 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with ORENCIA and for up to 14 weeks after 
the last dose of abatacept treatment. 
Fertility 
Formal studies of the potential effect of abatacept on human fertility have not been conducted. 
In rats, abatacept had no undesirable effects on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Based on its mechanism of action, abatacept is expected to have no or negligible influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines. However, dizziness and reduced visual acuity have been reported as 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
common and uncommon adverse reactions respectively from patients treated with ORENCIA, 
therefore if a patient experiences such symptoms, driving and use of machinery should be avoided. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis 
Abatacept has been studied in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in placebo-controlled clinical 
trials (2,653 patients with abatacept, 1,485 with placebo). 
In placebo-controlled clinical trials with abatacept, adverse reactions (ARs) were reported in 49.4% of 
abatacept-treated patients and 45.8% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse 
reactions (≥ 5%) among abatacept-treated patients were headache, nausea, and upper respiratory tract 
infections (including sinusitis). The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to ARs 
was 3.0% for abatacept-treated patients and 2.0% for placebo-treated patients. 
Summary of the safety profile in psoriatic arthritis 
Abatacept has been studied in patients with active psoriatic arthritis in two placebo-controlled clinical 
trials (341 patients with abatacept, 253 patients with placebo) (see section 5.1). During the 24-week 
placebo-controlled period in the larger study PsA-II, the proportion of patients with adverse reactions 
was similar in the abatacept and placebo treatment groups (15.5% and 11.4%, respectively). There 
were no adverse reactions that occurred at ≥ 2% in either treatment group during the 24-week 
placebo-controlled period. The overall safety profile was comparable between studies PsA-I and 
PsA-II and consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis (Table 2). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Listed in Table 2 are adverse reactions observed in clinical trials and post-marketing experience 
presented by system organ class and frequency, using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very 
rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
In the placebo-controlled clinical trials with abatacept, infections at least possibly related to treatment 
were reported in 22.7% of abatacept-treated patients and 20.5% of placebo-treated patients. 
Serious infections at least possibly related to treatment were reported in 1.5% of abatacept-treated 
patients and 1.1% of placebo-treated patients. The type of serious infections was similar between the 
abatacept and placebo treatment groups (see section 4.4). 
The incidence rates (95% CI) for serious infections was 3.0 (2.3, 3.8) per 100 patient-years for 
abatacept-treated patients and 2.3 (1.5, 3.3) per 100 patient-years for placebo-treated patients in the 
double-blind studies. 
In the cumulative period in clinical trials in 7,044 patients treated with abatacept during 
20,510 patient-years, the incidence rate of serious infections was 2.4 per 100 patient-years, and the 
annualised incidence rate remained stable. 
Malignancies 
In placebo-controlled clinical trials, malignancies were reported in 1.2% (31/2,653) 
of abatacept-treated patients and in 0.9% (14/1,485) of placebo-treated patients. The incidence rates 
for malignancies was 1.3 (0.9, 1.9) per 100 patient-years for abatacept-treated patients and 1.1 (0.6, 
1.9) per 100 patient-years for placebo-treated patients. 
In the cumulative period 7,044 patients treated with abatacept during 21,011 patient-years (of which 
over 1,000 were treated with abatacept for over 5 years), the incidence rate of malignancy was 
1.2 (1.1, 1.4) per 100 patient-years, and the annualized incidence rates remained stable. 
The most frequently reported malignancy in the placebo-controlled clinical trials was non-melanoma 
skin cancer; 0.6 (0.3, 1.0) per 100 patient-years for abatacept-treated patients and 0.4 (0.1, 0.9) per 
100 patient-years for placebo-treated patients and 0.5 (0.4, 0.6) per 100 patient-years in the cumulative 
period. 
The most frequently reported organ cancer in the placebo-controlled clinical trials was lung cancer 
0.17 (0.05, 0.43) per 100 patient-years for abatacept-treated patients, 0 for placebo-treated patients and 
0.12 (0.08, 0.17) per 100 patient-years in the cumulative period. The most common hematologic 
malignancy was lymphoma 0.04 (0, 0.24) per 100 patient-years for abatacept-treated patients, 0 for 
placebo-treated patients and 0.06 (0.03, 0.1) per 100 patient-years in the cumulative period. 
Infusion-related reactions 
Acute infusion-related events (adverse reactions occurring within 1 hour of the start of the infusion) in 
seven pooled intravenous studies (for studies II, III, IV and V see section 5.1) were more common in 
the abatacept-treated patients than the placebo-treated patients (5.2% for abatacept, 3.7% for placebo). 
The most frequently reported event with abatacept (1-2%) was dizziness. 
Acute infusion-related events that were reported in > 0.1% and ≤ 1% of patients treated with abatacept 
included cardiopulmonary symptoms such as hypotension, decreased blood pressure, tachycardia, 
bronchospasm, and dyspnoea; other symptoms included myalgia, nausea, erythema, flushing, urticaria, 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypersensitivity, pruritus, throat tightness, chest discomfort, chills, infusion site extravasation, infusion 
site pain, infusion site swelling, infusion related reaction, and rash. Most of these reactions were mild 
to moderate. 
The occurrence of anaphylaxis remained rare during the double blind and the cumulative period. 
Hypersensitivity was reported uncommonly. Other reactions potentially associated with 
hypersensitivity to the medicinal product, such as hypotension, urticaria, and dyspnoea, that occurred 
within 24 hours of ORENCIA infusion, were uncommon. 
Discontinuation due to an acute infusion-related reaction occurred in 0.3% of patients receiving 
abatacept and in 0.1% of placebo-treated patients. 
Adverse reactions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
In study IV, there were 37 patients with COPD treated with intravenous abatacept and 17 treated with 
placebo. The COPD patients treated with abatacept developed adverse reactions more frequently than 
those treated with placebo (51.4% vs. 47.1%, respectively). Respiratory disorders occurred more 
frequently in abatacept-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (10.8% vs. 5.9%, respectively); 
these included COPD exacerbation, and dyspnoea. A greater percentage of abatacept- than 
placebo-treated patients with COPD developed a serious adverse reaction (5.4% vs. 0%), including 
COPD exacerbation (1 of 37 patients [2.7%]) and bronchitis (1 of 37 patients [2.7%]). 
Autoimmune processes 
Abatacept therapy did not lead to increased formation of autoantibodies, i.e., antinuclear and anti-
dsDNA antibodies, compared with placebo. 
The incidence rate of autoimmune disorders in abatacept-treated patients during the double-blind 
period was 8.8 (7.6, 10.1) per 100 person-years of exposure and for placebo-treated patients was 
9.6 (7.9, 11.5) per 100 person-years of exposure. The incidence rate in abatacept-treated patients was 
3.8 per 100 person-years in the cumulative period. The most frequently reported autoimmune-related 
disorders other than the indication being studied during the cumulative period were psoriasis, 
rheumatoid nodule, and Sjogren's syndrome. 
Immunogenicity 
Antibodies directed against the abatacept molecule were assessed by ELISA assays in 
3,985 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated for up to 8 years with abatacept. One hundred and 
eighty seven of 3,877 (4.8%) patients developed anti-abatacept antibodies while on treatment. In 
patients assessed for anti-abatacept antibodies after discontinuation of abatacept (> 42 days after last 
dose), 103 of 1,888 (5.5%) were seropositive. 
Samples with confirmed binding activity to CTLA-4 were assessed for the presence of neutralizing 
antibodies. Twenty-two of 48 evaluable patients showed significant neutralizing activity. The potential 
clinical relevance of neutralizing antibody formation is not known. 
Overall, there was no apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse 
events. However, the number of patients that developed antibodies was too limited to make a 
definitive assessment. Because immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody 
rates with those from other products is not appropriate. 
Safety information related to the pharmacological class 
Abatacept is the first selective co-stimulation modulator. Information on the relative safety in a 
clinical trial versus infliximab is summarised in section 5.1. 
Paediatric population 
Abatacept has been studied in patients with pJIA in two clinical trials (pJIA SC study and pJIA IV 
study). The pJIA SC study included 46 patients in the 2 to 5 year age cohort and 173 patients in the 6 
to 17 year age cohort. The pJIA IV study included 190 patients in the 6 to 17 year age cohort. During 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the first 4-month open-label period, the overall safety profile in these 409 pJIA patients was similar to 
that observed in the RA population with the following exceptions in the pJIA patients: 
 
 
Common adverse reactions: pyrexia 
Uncommon adverse reactions: haematuria, otitis (media and externa). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
Infections were the most commonly reported adverse events in patients with pJIA. The types of 
infections were consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric populations. During the 
first 4-month treatment period of intravenous and subcutaneous abatacept in 409 patients with pJIA, 
the most common adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis (3.7% patients) and upper respiratory tract 
infection (2.9% patients). Two serious infections (varicella and sepsis) were reported during the initial 
4 months of treatment with abatacept. 
Infusion-related reactions 
Of the 190 patients with pJIA treated with intravenous ORENCIA, one (0.5%) patient discontinued 
due to non-consecutive infusion reactions, consisting of bronchospasm and urticaria. During Periods 
A, B, and C, acute infusion-related reactions occurred at a frequency of 4%, 2%, and 4%, respectively, 
and were consistent with the types of reactions reported in adults. 
Immunogenicity 
Antibodies directed against the entire abatacept molecule or to the CTLA-4 portion of abatacept were 
assessed by ELISA assays in patients with pJIA following repeated treatment with intravenous 
ORENCIA. The rate of seropositivity while patients were receiving abatacept therapy was 0.5% 
(1/189) during Period A; 13.0% (7/54) during Period B; and 12.8% (19/148) during Period C. For 
patients in Period B who were randomised to placebo (therefore withdrawn from therapy for up to 
6 months) the rate of seropositivity was 40.7% (22/54). Anti-abatacept antibodies were generally 
transient and of low titer. The absence of concomitant methotrexate (MTX) did not appear to be 
associated with a higher rate of seropositivity in Period B placebo recipients. The presence of 
antibodies was not associated with adverse reactions or infusion reactions, or with changes in efficacy 
or serum abatacept concentrations. Of the 54 patients withdrawn from ORENCIA during the double-
blind period for up to 6 months, none had an infusion reaction upon re-initiation of ORENCIA. 
Long-term extension period 
During the extension period of the pJIA studies (20 months in the pJIA SC study and 5 years in the 
pJIA IV study), the safety profile in the pJIA patients aged 6 to 17 years was comparable to that seen 
in adult patients. One patient was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis while in the extension period of 
the pJIA IV study. One serious adverse reaction of infection (limb abscess) was reported in the 2 to 
5 year age cohort during the 20-month extension period of the pJIA SC study. 
Long-term safety data in 2 to 5 year age cohort with pJIA was limited, but the existing evidence did 
not reveal any new safety concern in this younger paediatric population. During the 24-month 
cumulative period of the pJIA SC study (4-month short term period plus 20-month extension period), a 
higher frequency of infections was reported in the 2 to 5 year age cohort (87.0%) compared to that 
reported in the 6 to 17 year age cohort (68.2%). This was mostly due to non-serious upper respiratory 
tract infections in the 2 to 5 year age cohort. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 50 mg/kg have been administered without apparent toxic effect. In case of overdose, it is 
recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and 
appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: 
L04AA24 
Abatacept is a fusion protein that consists of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic 
T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) linked to a modified Fc portion of human 
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Abatacept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese 
hamster ovary cells. 
Mechanism of action 
Abatacept selectively modulates a key costimulatory signal required for full activation of T 
lymphocytes expressing CD28. Full activation of T lymphocytes requires two signals provided by 
antigen presenting cells: recognition of a specific antigen by a T cell receptor (signal 1) and a second, 
costimulatory signal. A major costimulatory pathway involves the binding of CD80 and 
CD86 molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells to the CD28 receptor on T lymphocytes 
(signal 2). Abatacept selectively inhibits this costimulatory pathway by specifically binding to 
CD80 and CD86. Studies indicate that naive T lymphocyte responses are more affected by abatacept 
than memory T lymphocyte responses. 
Studies in vitro and in animal models demonstrate that abatacept modulates T lymphocyte-dependent 
antibody responses and inflammation. In vitro, abatacept attenuates human T lymphocyte activation as 
measured by decreased proliferation and cytokine production. Abatacept decreases antigen specific 
TNFα, interferon-γ, and interleukin-2 production by T lymphocytes. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Dose-dependent reductions were observed with abatacept in serum levels of soluble interleukin-
2 receptor, a marker of T lymphocyte activation; serum interleukin-6, a product of activated synovial 
macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatoid factor, an 
autoantibody produced by plasma cells; and C-reactive protein, an acute phase reactant of 
inflammation. In addition, serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3, which produces cartilage 
destruction and tissue remodelling, were decreased. Reductions in serum TNFα were also observed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in adult rheumatoid arthritis 
The efficacy and safety of intravenous abatacept were assessed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trials in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to 
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Studies I, II, III, V, and VI required patients to 
have at least 12 tender and 10 swollen joints at randomisation. Study IV did not require any specific 
number of tender or swollen joints. 
In studies I, II, and V the efficacy and safety of abatacept compared to placebo were assessed in 
patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate and who continued on their stable dose of 
methotrexate. In addition, study V investigated the safety and efficacy of abatacept or infliximab 
relative to placebo. In study III the efficacy and safety of abatacept were assessed in patients with an 
inadequate response to a TNF-inhibitor, with the TNF-inhibitor discontinued prior to randomisation; 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other DMARDs were permitted. Study IV primarily assessed safety in patients with active rheumatoid 
arthritis requiring additional intervention in spite of current therapy with non-biological and/or 
biological DMARDs; all DMARDs used at enrollment were continued. In study VI, the efficacy and 
safety of abatacept were assessed in methotrexate-naive, Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and/or anti-Cyclic 
Citrullinated Peptide 2 (Anti-CCP2)-positive patients with early, erosive rheumatoid arthritis 
(≤ 2 years disease duration) who were randomised to receive abatacept plus methotrexate or 
methotrexate plus placebo. Study SC-II investigated the relative efficacy and safety of abatacept and 
adalimumab, both given subcutaneously without an intravenous loading dose and with background 
MTX, in patients with moderate to severely active RA and an inadequate response to previous MTX 
therapy. In study SC-III, abatacept subcutaneous was evaluated in combination with methotrexate 
(MTX), or as abatacept monotherapy, and compared to MTX monotherapy in induction of remission 
following 12 months of treatment, and the possible maintenance of drug-free remission after complete 
drug withdrawal, in adult MTX-naive patients with highly active early, rheumatoid arthritis (mean 
DAS28-CRP of 5.4; mean symptom duration less than 6.7 months) with poor prognostic factors for 
rapidly progressive disease (e.g., anti-citrullinated protein antibodies [ACPA+], as measured by 
anti-CCP2 assay, and/or RF+, baseline joint erosions). 
Study I patients were randomised to receive abatacept 2 or 10 mg/kg or placebo for 12 months. 
Study II, III, IV, and VI patients were randomised to receive a fixed dose approximating 10 mg/kg of 
abatacept or placebo for 12 (studies II, IV, and VI) or 6 months (study III). The dose of abatacept 
was 500 mg for patients weighing less than 60 kg, 750 mg for patients weighing 60 to 100 kg, and 
1,000 mg for patients weighing greater than 100 kg. Study V patients were randomised to receive this 
same fixed dose of abatacept or 3 mg/kg infliximab or placebo for 6 months. Study V continued for an 
additional 6 months with the abatacept and infliximab groups only. 
Studies I, II, III, IV, V, VI, SC-II, and SC-III evaluated 339, 638, 389, 1441, 431, 509, 646, and 
351 adult patients, respectively. 
Clinical response 
ACR response 
The percent of abatacept-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50, and 70 responses in study II (patients 
with inadequate response to methotrexate), study III (patients with inadequate response to 
TNF-inhibitor), and study VI (methotrexate-naive patients) are shown in Table 3. 
In abatacept-treated patients in studies II and III, statistically significant improvement in the 
ACR 20 response versus placebo was observed after administration of the first dose (day 15), and this 
improvement remained significant for the duration of the studies. In study VI, statistically significant 
improvement in the ACR 20 response in abatacept plus methotrexate-treated patients versus 
methotrexate plus placebo-treated patients was observed at 29 days, and was maintained through the 
duration of the study. In study II, 43% of the patients who had not achieved an ACR 20 response 
at 6 months developed an ACR 20 response at 12 months.

In the open-label extension of studies I, II, III, and VI durable and sustained ACR 20, 50, 
and 70 responses have been observed through 7 years, 5 years, 5 years, and 2 years, respectively, of 
abatacept treatment. In study I, ACR responses were assessed at 7 years in 43 patients with 72% 
ACR 20 responses, 58% ACR 50 responses, and 44% ACR 70 responses. In study II, ACR responses 
were assessed at 5 years in 270 patients with 84% ACR 20 responses, 61% ACR 50 responses, and 
40% ACR 70 responses. In study III, ACR responses were assessed at 5 years in 91 patients with 74% 
ACR 20 responses, 51% ACR 50 responses, and 23% ACR 70 responses. In study VI, ACR responses 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were assessed at 2 years in 232 patients with 85% ACR 20 responses, 74% ACR 50 responses, and 
54% ACR 70 responses. 
Greater improvements were seen with abatacept than with placebo in other measures of rheumatoid 
arthritis disease activity not included in the ACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. 
DAS28 response 
Disease activity was also assessed using the Disease Activity Score 28. There was a significant 
improvement of DAS in studies II, III, V, and VI as compared to placebo or comparator. 
In study VI, which only included adults, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the abatacept 
plus methotrexate group (41%) achieved DAS28 (CRP)-defined remission (score < 2.6) versus the 
methotrexate plus placebo group (23%) at year 1. The response at year 1 in the abatacept group was 
maintained through year 2. 
In the substudy of study VI, patients who had achieved remission at 2 years (DAS 28 ESR < 2.6) and 
after at least 1 year of treatment with abatacept in study VI were eligible to enter a substudy. In the 
substudy 108 subjects were randomised 1:1 in double blinded fashion to receive abatacept at doses 
approximating 10 mg/kg (ABA 10) or 5 mg/kg (ABA 5). After 1 year of treatment, the maintenance of 
remission was assessed by the relapse of the disease. The time to and proportion of patients with the 
relapse of the disease observed between the two groups were similar. 
Study V: abatacept or infliximab versus placebo 
A randomised, double-blind study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of abatacept or 
infliximab versus placebo in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate (study V). The 
primary outcome was the mean change in disease activity in abatacept-treated patients compared to 
placebo-treated patients at 6 months with a subsequent double-blind assessment of safety and efficacy 
of abatacept and infliximab at 12 months. Greater improvement (p < 0.001) in DAS28 was observed 
with abatacept and with infliximab compared to placebo at six months in the placebo-controlled 
portion of the trial; the results between the abatacept and infliximab groups were similar. The ACR 
responses in study V were consistent with the DAS28 score. Further improvement was observed at 
12 months with abatacept. At 6 months, the incidence of AE of infections were 48.1% (75), 
52.1% (86), and 51.8% (57) and the incidence of serious AE of infections were 1.3% (2), 4.2% (7), 
and 2.7% (3) for abatacept, infliximab and placebo groups, respectively. At 12 months, the incidence 
of AE of infections were 59.6% (93), 68.5% (113), and the incidence of serious AE of infections were 
1.9% (3) and 8.5% (14) for abatacept and infliximab groups, respectively. The open label period of the 
study provided an assessment of the ability of abatacept to maintain efficacy for subjects originally 
randomised to abatacept and the efficacy response of those subjects who were switched to abatacept 
following treatment with infliximab. The reduction from baseline in mean DAS28 score at 
day 365 (-3.06) was maintained through day 729 (-3.34) in those patients who continued with 
abatacept. In those patients who initially received infliximab and then switched to abatacept, the 
reduction in the mean DAS28 score from baseline was 3.29 at day 729 and 2.48 at day 365. 
Study SC-II: abatacept versus adalimumab 
A randomised, single (investigator)-blinded, non-inferiority study was conducted to assess the safety 
and efficacy of weekly subcutaneous (SC) abatacept without an abatacept intravenous (IV) loading 
dose versus every-other-weekly subcutaneous adalimumab, both with background MTX, in patients 
with an inadequate response to methotrexate (study SC-II). The primary endpoint showed 
non-inferiority (predefined margin of 12%) of ACR 20 response after 12 months of treatment, 
64.8% (206/318) for the abatacept SC group and 63.4% (208/328) for the adalimumab SC group; 
treatment difference was 1.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): -5.6, 9.2], with comparable responses 
throughout the 24-month period. The respective values for ACR 20 at 24 months were 
59.7% (190/318) for the abatacept SC group and 60.1% (197/328) for the adalimumab SC group. The 
respective values for ACR 50 and ACR 70 at 12 months and 24 months were consistent and similar for 
abatacept and adalimumab. The adjusted mean changes (standard error; SE) from baseline in 
DAS28-CRP were -2.35 (SE 0.08) [95% CI: -2.51, -2.19] and -2.33 (SE 0.08) [95% CI: -2.50, -2.17] 
in the SC abatacept group and the adalimumab group, respectively, at 24 months, with similar changes 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
over time. At 24 months, 50.6% (127/251) [95% CI: 44.4, 56.8] of patients in abatacept and 
53.3% (130/244) [95% CI: 47.0, 59.5] of patients in adalimumab groups achieved DAS 28 < 2.6. 
Improvement from baseline as measured by HAQ-DI at 24 months and over time was also similar 
between abatacept SC and adalimumab SC. 
Safety and structural damage assessments were conducted at one and two years. The overall safety 
profile with respect to adverse reactions was similar between the two groups over the 24-month 
period. After 24 months, adverse reactions were reported in 41.5% (132/318) and 50% (164/328) of 
abatacept and adalimumab-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 3.5% (11/318) 
and 6.1% (20/328) of the respective group. At 24 months, 20.8% (66/318) of patients on abatacept and 
25.3% (83/328) on adalimumab had discontinued. 
In SC-II, serious infections were reported in 3.8% (12/318) of patients treated with abatacept SC 
weekly, none of which led to discontinuation and in 5.8% (19/328) of patients treated with 
adalimumab SC every-other-week, leading to 9 discontinuations in the 24-month period. 
The frequency of local injection site reactions was 3.8% (12/318) and 9.1% (30/328) at 12 months 
(p = 0.006) and 4.1% (13/318) and 10.4% (34/328) at 24 months for abatacept SC and adalimumab 
SC, respectively. Over the 2 year study period, 3.8% (12/318) and 1.5% (5/328) patients treated with 
abatacept SC and adalimumab SC respectively reported autoimmune disorders mild to moderate in 
severity (e.g., psoriasis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, erythema nodosum). 
Study SC-III: Induction of remission in methotrexate-naive RA patients 
A randomised and double-blinded study evaluated abatacept SC in combination with methotrexate 
(abatacept + MTX), abatacept SC monotherapy, or methotrexate monotherapy (MTX group) in 
induction of remission following 12 months of treatment, and maintenance of drug-free remission after 
complete drug withdrawal in MTX-naive adult patients with highly active early rheumatoid arthritis 
with poor prognostic factors. Complete drug withdrawal led to loss of remission (return to disease 
activity) in all three treatment arms (abatacept with methotrexate, abatacept or methotrexate alone) in a 
majority of patients (Table 4).

In SC-III the safety profiles of the three treatment groups (abatacept + MTX, abatacept monotherapy, 
MTX group) were overall similar. During the 12-month treatment period, adverse reactions were 
reported in 44.5% (53/119), 41.4% (48/116), and 44.0% (51/116) and serious adverse reactions were 
reported in 2.5% (3/119), 2.6% (3/116) and 0.9% (1/116) of patients treated in the three treatment 
groups, respectively. Serious infections were reported in 0.8% (1/119), 3.4% (4/116) and 0% (0/116) 
patients. 
Radiographic response 
Structural joint damage was assessed radiographically over a two-year period in studies II, and VI. 
The results were measured using the Genant-modified total Sharp score (TSS) and its components, the 
erosion score and joint space narrowing (JSN) score. 
In study II, the baseline median TSS was 31.7 in abatacept-treated patients and 33.4 in placebo-treated 
patients. Abatacept/methotrexate reduced the rate of progression of structural damage compared to 
placebo/methotrexate after 12 months of treatment as shown in Table 5. The rate of progression of 
structural damage in year 2 was significantly lower than that in year 1 for patients randomised to 
abatacept (p < 0.0001). Subjects entering the long term extension after 1 year of double blind 
treatment all received abatacept treatment and radiographic progression was investigated through 
year 5. Data were analysed in an as-observed analysis using mean change in total score from the 
previous annual visit. The mean change was, 0.41 and 0.74 from year 1 to year 2 (n = 290, 130), 0.37 
and 0.68 from year 2 to year 3 (n = 293, 130), 0.34 and 0.43 from year 3 to year 4 (n = 290, 128) and 
the change was 0.26 and 0.29 (n = 233, 114) from year 4 to year 5 for patients originally randomised 
to abatacept plus MTX and placebo plus MTX respectively.

In study VI, the mean change in TSS at 12 months was significantly lower in patients treated with 
abatacept plus methotrexate compared to those treated with methotrexate plus placebo. At 12 months 
61% (148/242) of the patients treated with abatacept plus methotrexate and 53% (128/242) of the 
patients treated with methotrexate plus placebo had no progression (TSS ≤ 0). The progression of 
structural damage was lower in patients receiving continuous abatacept plus methotrexate treatment 
(for 24 months) compared to patients who initially received methotrexate plus placebo (for 12 months) 
and were switched to abatacept plus methotrexate for the next 12 months. Among the patients who 
entered the open-label 12-month period, 59% (125/213) of patients receiving continuous abatacept

plus methotrexate treatment and 48% (92/192) of patients who initially received methotrexate and 
switched to combination with abatacept had no progression. 
In study SC-III, structural joint damage was assessed by MRI. The abatacept + MTX group had less 
progression in structural damage compared with MTX group as reflected by mean treatment difference 
of the abatacept + MTX group versus MTX group (Table 6).

e After 6 months, patients were given the opportunity to enter into an open-label study. 
In study II, among patients with clinically meaningful improvement at month 12, 88% retained the 
response at month 18, and 85% retained the response at month 24. During the open-label periods of 
studies I, II, III, and VI the improvement in physical function has been maintained through 7 years, 
5 years, 5 years, and 2 years, respectively. 
In study SC-III, the proportion of subjects with a HAQ response as a measure of clinically meaningful 
improvement in physical function (reduction from baseline in HAQ-D1 score of ≥ 0.3) was greater for 
the abatacept + MTX group vs. the MTX group at month 12 (65.5% vs 44.0%, respectively; treatment 
difference vs. MTX group of 21.6% [95% CI: 8.3, 34.9]). 
Health-related outcomes and quality of life 
Health-related quality of life was assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire at 6 months in studies I, II, and 
III and at 12 months in studies I and II. In these studies, clinically and statistically significant 
improvement was observed in the abatacept group as compared with the placebo group in 
all 8 domains of the SF-36 (4 physical domains: physical function, role physical, bodily pain, general 
health; and 4 mental domains: vitality, social function, role emotional, mental health), as well as the 
Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In study VI, 
improvement was observed at 12 months in abatacept plus methotrexate group as compared with the 
methotrexate plus placebo group in both PCS and MCS, and was maintained through 2 years. 
Study VII: Safety of abatacept in patients with or without washout of previous TNF-inhibitor therapy 
A study of open-label abatacept on a background of nonbiologic DMARDs was conducted in patients 
with active RA who had an inadequate response to previous (washout for at least 2 months; n = 449) 
or current (no washout period; n = 597) TNF-inhibitor therapy (study VII). The primary outcome, 
incidence of AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs during 6 months of treatment, was similar 
between those who were previous and current TNF-inhibitor users at enrollment, as was the frequency 
of serious infections. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in adult psoriatic arthritis 
The efficacy and safety of abatacept were assessed in two randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trials (studies PsA-I and PsA-II) in adult patients, age 18 years and older. Patients 
had active PsA (≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) despite prior treatment with DMARD therapy 
and had one qualifying psoriatic skin lesion of at least 2 cm in diameter. 
In study PsA-I, 170 patients received placebo or abatacept intravenously on day 1, 15, 29, and then 
every 28 days thereafter in a double blind manner for 24 weeks, followed by open-label abatacept 
10 mg/kg intravenously every 28 days. Patients were randomised to receive placebo or abatacept 
3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or two doses of 30 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg, without escape for 24 weeks, 
followed by open label abatacept 10 mg/kg monthly intravenous every month. Patients were allowed 
to receive stable doses of concomitant methotrexate, low dose corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg 
of prednisone) and/or NSAIDs during the trial. 
In study PsA-II, 424 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive in a double-blind manner weekly doses 
of subcutaneous placebo or abatacept 125 mg without a loading dose for 24 weeks, followed by 
open-label abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous weekly. Patients were allowed to receive stable doses of 
concomitant methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, low dose corticosteroids 
(equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone) and/or NSAIDs during the trial. Patients who had not achieved 
at least a 20% improvement from baseline in their swollen and tender joint counts by week 16 escaped 
to open-label abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous weekly.

The primary endpoint for both PsA-I and PsA-II was the proportion of patients achieving ACR 20 
response at Week 24 (day 169).

A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved an ACR 20 response after treatment with 
abatacept 10 mg/kg intravenous in PsA-I or 125 mg subcutaneous in PsA-II compared to placebo at 
Week 24 in the overall study populations. Higher ACR 20 responses were observed with abatacept vs 
placebo regardless of prior TNF-inhibitor treatment in both studies. In the smaller study PsA-I, the 
ACR 20 responses with abatacept 10 mg/kg intravenous vs placebo in patients who were TNF 
inhibitor-naive were 55.6% vs 20.0%, respectively, and in patients who were TNF 
inhibitor-experienced were 30.8% vs 16.7%, respectively. In study PsA-II, the ACR 20 responses with 
abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous vs placebo in patients who were TNF inhibitor-naive were 44.0% vs 
22.2%, respectively (21.9 [8.3, 35.6], estimate of difference [95% CI]), and in patients who were TNF 
inhibitor-experienced were 36.4% vs 22.3%, respectively (14.0 [3.3, 24.8], estimate of difference 
[95% CI]). 
Higher ACR 20 responses in study PsA-II were seen with abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous vs. placebo 
irrespective of concomitant nonbiological DMARD treatment. The ACR 20 responses with abatacept 
125 mg subcutaneous vs placebo in patients who did not use nonbiological DMARDs were 27.3% vs 
12.1%, respectively, (15.15 [1.83, 28.47], estimate of difference [95% CI]), and in patients who had 
used non-biological DMARDs were 44.9% vs 26.9%, respectively, (18.00 [7.20, 28.81], estimate of 
difference [95% CI]). Clinical responses were maintained or continued to improve up to one year in 
studies PsA-I and PsA-II. 
Structural response 
In study PsA-II, the proportion of radiographic non-progressors (≤ 0 change from baseline) in total 
PsA-modified SHS on x-rays at Week 24 was greater with abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous (42.7%) 
than placebo (32.7%) (10.0 [1.0, 19.1] estimate of difference [95% CI]).

Physical Function Response 
In study PsA-I, the proportion of patients with ≥ 0.30 decrease from baseline in HAQ-DI score was 
45.0% with intravenous abatacept vs 19.0% with placebo (26.1 [6.8, 45.5], estimate of difference 
[95% CI]) at Week 24. In study PsA-II, the proportion of patients with at least ≥ 0.35 decrease from 
baseline in HAQ-DI was 31.0% with abatacept vs. 23.7% with placebo (7.2 [-1.1, 15.6], estimate of 
difference [95% CI]). Improvement in HAQ-DI scores was maintained or improved for up to 1 year 
with continuing abatacept treatment in both PsA-I and PsA-II studies. 
No significant changes in PASI scores with abatacept treatment were seen over the 24-week 
double-blind period. Patients entering the two PsA studies had mild to moderate psoriasis with median 
PASI scores of 8.6 in PsA-I and 4.5 in PsA-II. In study PsA-I, the proportions of patients achieving 
PASI 50 response was 28.6% with abatacept vs. 14.3% with placebo (14.3 [-15.3, 43.9], estimate of 
difference [95% CI]), and the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 75 response was 14.3% with 
abatacept vs. 4.8% with placebo (9.5 [-13.0, 32.0], estimate of difference [95% CI]). In study PsA-II, 
the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 50 response was 26.7% with abatacept vs. 19.6% with 
placebo (7.3 [-2.2, 16.7], estimate of difference [95% CI]), and the proportion of patients who 
achieved PASI 75 response was 16.4% with abatacept vs. 10.1% with placebo (6.4 [-1.3, 14.1], 
estimate of difference [95% CI]). 
Paediatric population in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Children and adolescents with moderate to severe active pJIA, ages 6 to 17 years with an inadequate 
response or intolerance to at least one DMARD, which may have included biologic agents, were 
enrolled. The safety and efficacy of intravenous abatacept were assessed in a three-part study. 
Period A was a 4-month open-label lead-in designed to induce an ACR Pedi 30 response. Patients 
achieving at least a ACR Pedi 30 response at the end of Period A were randomised into a 
double-blind, withdrawal phase (Period B), and received either abatacept or placebo for 6 months or 
until pJIA disease flare as defined in the study. Unless they had discontinued due to safety reasons, all 
patients who completed, or had a flare during Period B or were non-responders in Period A were 
offered entry into Period C, the open-label extension, which assessed long-term safety and efficacy. 
In Period A all patients received 10 mg/kg of abatacept on days 1, 15, 29, 57 and 85 and were assessed 
on day 113. During period A, 74% were taking methotrexate (mean dose at study entry, 
13.2 mg/m2/week) thus, 26% of patients received abatacept monotherapy in Period A. Of the 
190 patients entering the study, 57 (30%) had previously been treated with TNF-inhibitor therapy. 
ACR Pedi 30 responders at the end of Period A were randomised into Period B, the double-blind, 
withdrawal phase, to receive either abatacept or placebo for 6 months or until JIA flare. 
Flare was defined as: 
 
 
 
≥ 30% worsening in at least 3 of the 6 pJIA core set variables 
≥ 30% improvement in not more than 1 of the 6 pJIA core set variables 
≥ 2 cm (possible up to 10 cm) of worsening must have been present if the Physician or Parent 
Global Assessment was used to define flare 
worsening in ≥ 2 joints must have been present if the number of active joints or joints with 
limited range of motion was used to define flare 
 
The patients entered in the trial were a mean of 12.4 years of age with mean disease duration of 
4.4 years. They had active disease, with baseline mean active joint count of 16 and a mean number of 
joints with loss of motion of 16; and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (mean, 3.2 mg/dL) and 
ESRs (mean, 32 mm/h). Their pJIA subtypes at disease onset were: oligoarticular (16%), polyarticular 
(64%; 20% of the total were rheumatoid factor positive), and systemic (20%). 
Of the 190 patients enrolled, 170 completed Period A, 65% (123/190) achieved an ACR Pedi 30 
response, and 122 were randomised to Period B. Responses were similar in all subtypes of pJIA 
studied and for patients with or without methotrexate use. Of the 133 (70%) patients with no prior 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TNF-inhibitor therapy, 101 (76%) achieved at least an ACR Pedi 30 response; of the 57 patients who 
had received prior TNF-inhibitor therapy, 22 (39%) achieved at least an ACR Pedi 30 response. 
During Period B, the time to disease flare for the patients randomised to placebo was significantly 
shorter than for those randomised to abatacept (primary endpoint, p = 0.0002; log-rank test). 
Significantly more placebo recipients flared during Period B (33/62; 53%) than those maintained on 
abatacept (12/60; 20%; chi-square p < 0.001). The risk of disease flare for patients continuing on 
abatacept was less than one third that for placebo-treated patients (hazard ratio estimate = 0.31; 
95% CI 0.16, 0.59). 
Most randomised Period B patients entered Period C (58/60 Period B abatacept recipients; 59/62 
Period B placebo recipients), as did 36 of the 47 Period A non-responders (n = 153 total patients). 
Response rates at the end of Period A, at the end of Period B and after 5 years exposure in Period C 
are summarized in Table 9:

Participants in Period C at day 1765 included 33 of the 58 Period B abatacept recipients, 30 of the 59 
Period B placebo recipients, and 13 of the 36 Period A non-responders. The median duration of 
abatacept treatment in Period C was 1815 days (range 57–2,415 days; nearly 61 months). One hundred 
and two (67%) of the subjects had received at least 1,080 days (~ 36 months) of abatacept therapy in 
Period C. All patients had at least 4 months of prior, open-label abatacept treatment in Period A. 
Abatacept in pJIA patients has also been studied with the subcutaneous formulation in children and 
adolescents with moderate to severe active pJIA, ages 2 to 17 years with an inadequate response or 
intolerance to at least one DMARD, which may have included biologic agents. The safety and efficacy 
of abatacept in the ongoing SC study were consistent with the results seen with abatacept in the IV 
study (see section 5.1 of the ORENCIA solution for injection in pre-filled syringe SmPC for complete 
study description and results). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Adult rheumatoid arthritis 
After multiple intravenous infusions (days 1, 15, 30, and every 4 weeks thereafter), the 
pharmacokinetics of abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis patients showed dose-proportional increases of 
Cmax and AUC over the dose range of 2 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. At 10 mg/kg, the mean terminal half-life 
was 13.1 days, ranging from 8 to 25 days. The mean distribution volume (Vss) was 0.07 L/kg and 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ranged from 0.02 to 0.13 L/kg. The systemic clearance was approximately 0.22 mL/h/kg. Mean 
steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 25 mcg/mL, and mean Cmax concentrations 
were approximately 290 mcg/mL. No systemic accumulation of abatacept occurred upon continued 
repeated treatment with 10 mg/kg at monthly intervals in rheumatoid arthritis patients. 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that there was a trend toward higher clearance of 
abatacept with increasing body weight. Age and gender (when corrected for body weight) did not 
affect clearance. Methotrexate, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and TNF-inhibitors were not found to 
influence abatacept clearance. No studies were conducted to examine the effects of either renal or 
hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of abatacept. 
Adult psoriatic arthritis 
In PsA-I, patients were randomised to receive intravenous placebo or abatacept 3 mg/kg (3/3 mg/kg), 
10 mg/kg (10/10 mg/kg), or two doses of 30 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg (30/10 mg/kg), on day 1, 
15, 29, and then every 28 days thereafter. In this study, the steady-state concentrations of abatacept 
were dose-related. The geometric mean (CV%) cmin at day 169 were 7.8 mcg/mL (56.3%) for the 
3/3 mg/kg, 24.3 mcg/mL (40.8%) for 10/10 mg/kg, and 26.6 mcg/mL (39.0%) for the 30/10 mg/kg 
regimens. 
In study PsA-II following weekly subcutaneous administration of abatacept at 125 mg, steady-state of 
abatacept was reached at day 57 with the geometric mean (CV%) cmin ranging from 22.3 (54.2%) to 
25.6 (47.7%) mcg/mL on days 57 to 169, respectively. 
Consistent with the results observed earlier in RA patients, population pharmacokinetic analyses for 
abatacept in PsA patients revealed that there was a trend toward higher clearance (L/h) of abatacept 
with increasing body weight. 
Paediatric population 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of abatacept serum concentration data from patients with pJIA 6 
to 17 years of age following administration of intravenous abatacept 10 mg/kg revealed that the 
estimated clearance of abatacept, when normalised for baseline body weight, was higher in pJIA 
patients (0.4 mL/h/kg for a child weighing 40 kg) versus adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. Typical 
estimates for distribution volume and elimination half-life were 0.12 L/kg and 11.4 days, respectively, 
for a child weighing 40 kg. As a result of the higher body-weight normalised clearance and volume of 
distribution in pJIA patients, the predicted and observed systemic exposures of abatacept were lower 
than that observed in adults, such that the observed mean (range) peak and trough concentrations were 
204 (66 to 595) mcg/mL and 10.6 (0.15 to 44.2) mcg/mL, respectively, in patients weighing less than 
40 kg, and 229 (58 to 700) mcg/mL and 13.1 (0.34 to 44.6) mcg/mL, respectively, in patients 
weighing 40 kg or greater. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No mutagenicity or clastogenicity was observed with abatacept in a battery of in vitro studies. In a 
mouse carcinogenicity study, increases in the incidence of malignant lymphomas and mammary gland 
tumours (in females) occurred. The increased incidence of lymphomas and mammary tumours 
observed in mice treated with abatacept may have been associated with decreased control of murine 
leukaemia virus and mouse mammary tumour virus, respectively, in the presence of long-term 
immunomodulation. In a one-year toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, abatacept was not 
associated with any significant toxicity. Reversible pharmacological effects consisted of minimal 
transient decreases in serum IgG and minimal to severe lymphoid depletion of germinal centres in the 
spleen and/or lymph nodes. No evidence of lymphomas or preneoplastic morphological changes was 
observed, despite the presence of a virus, lymphocryptovirus, which is known to cause such lesions in 
immunosuppressed monkeys within the time frame of this study. The relevance of these findings to the 
clinical use of abatacept is unknown. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In rats, abatacept had no undesirable effects on male or female fertility. Embryo-foetal development 
studies were conducted with abatacept in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 20 to 30 times a 
human 10 mg/kg dose and no undesirable effects were observed in the offspring. In rats and rabbits, 
abatacept exposure was up to 29-fold a human 10 mg/kg exposure based on AUC. Abatacept was 
shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits. In a pre- and postnatal development study with 
abatacept in rats, no undesirable effects were observed in pups of dams given abatacept at doses up 
to 45 mg/kg, representing 3-fold a human 10 mg/kg exposure based on AUC. At a dose of 200 mg/kg, 
representing 11-fold a human exposure at 10 mg/kg based on AUC, limited changes in immune 
function (a 9-fold increase in the mean T-cell-dependent antibody response in female pups and 
inflammation of the thyroid of 1 female pup out of 10 male and 10 female pups evaluated at this dose) 
were observed. 
Non-clinical studies relevant for use in the paediatric population 
Studies in rats exposed to abatacept have shown immune system abnormalities including a low 
incidence of infections leading to death (juvenile rats). In addition, inflammation of the thyroid and 
pancreas was frequently seen in both juvenile and adult rats exposed to abatacept. Juvenile rats seemed 
to be more sensitive to lymphocytic inflammation of thyroid. Studies in adult mice and monkeys have 
not demonstrated similar findings. It is likely that the increased susceptibility to opportunistic 
infections observed in juvenile rats is associated with the exposure to abatacept before development of 
memory responses. The relevance of these results to humans is unknown.

Pack of 1 vial and 1 silicone-free syringe (polyethylene), and multipacks containing 2, or 3 vials and 2, 
or 3 silicone-free syringes (2 or 3 packs of 1). 
Not all pack-sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Reconstitution and dilution should be performed in accordance with good practices rules, particularly 
with respect to asepsis. 
Reconstitution 
Determine the dose and the number of ORENCIA vials needed (see section 4.2). 
Under aseptic conditions, reconstitute each vial with 10 mL of water for injections, using the 
silicone-free disposable syringe provided with each vial (see section 6.2) and an 18-21 gauge 
needle. 
- 
- 
Remove the flip-top from the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol swab. 
Insert the syringe needle into the vial through the centre of the rubber stopper and direct 
the stream of water for injections to the glass wall of the vial. 
Do not use the vial if the vacuum is not present. 
Remove the syringe and needle after 10 mL of water for injections have been injected 
into the vial. 
To minimise foam formation in solutions of ORENCIA, the vial should be rotated with 
gentle swirling until the contents are completely dissolved. Do not shake. Avoid 
prolonged or vigorous agitation. 
Upon complete dissolution of the powder, the vial should be vented with a needle to 
dissipate any foam that may be present. 
After reconstitution the solution should be clear and colourless to pale yellow. Do not use 
if opaque particles, discolouration, or other foreign particles are present.

Dilution 
3. 
Immediately after reconstitution, the concentrate must be further diluted to 100 mL with sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
- 
From a 100 mL infusion bag or bottle, withdraw a volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection equal to the volume of the reconstituted vials. 
Slowly add the reconstituted ORENCIA solution from each vial to the infusion bag or 
bottle using the same silicone-free disposable syringe provided with each vial. 
Gently mix. The final concentration of abatacept in the bag or bottle will depend upon the 
amount of active substance added, but will be no more than 10 mg/mL. 
Any unused portion in the vials must be immediately discarded in accordance with local 
requirements.

4.  When reconstitution and dilution are performed under aseptic conditions ORENCIA infusion 
solution can be used immediately or within 24 hours if stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C. Prior to 
administration, the ORENCIA solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discolouration. Discard the solution if any particulate matter or discolouration is observed. 
- 
Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
ORENCIA, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: 
 
the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who 
responded inadequately to previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX) or a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha 
inhibitor. 
the treatment of highly active and progressive disease in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
not previously treated with methotrexate. 
 
A reduction in the progression of joint damage and improvement of physical function have been 
demonstrated during combination treatment with abatacept and methotrexate. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
ORENCIA, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients when the response to previous DMARD therapy including 
MTX has been inadequate, and for whom additional systemic therapy for psoriatic skin lesions is not 
required. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
ORENCIA in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe 
active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in paediatric patients 2 years of age and older 
who have had an inadequate response to previous DMARD therapy. 
ORENCIA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when treatment with 
methotrexate is inappropriate. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. 
If a response to abatacept is not present within 6 months of treatment, the continuation of the treatment 
should be reconsidered (see section 5.1). 
Posology 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Adults 
ORENCIA subcutaneous (SC) may be initiated with or without an intravenous (IV) loading dose. 
ORENCIA SC should be administered weekly at a dose of 125 mg abatacept by subcutaneous 
injection regardless of weight (see section 5.1). If a single IV infusion is given to initiate treatment (IV 
loading dose before SC administration), the first 125 mg abatacept SC should be administered within a 
day of the IV infusion, followed by the weekly 125 mg abatacept SC injections (for the posology of 
the intravenous loading dose, please refer to section 4.2 of ORENCIA 250 mg powder for concentrate 
for solution for infusion). 
Patients switching from abatacept intravenous therapy to subcutaneous administration should 
administer the first subcutaneous dose instead of the next scheduled intravenous dose. 
No dose adjustment is required when used in combination with other DMARDs, corticosteroids, 
salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or analgesics. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Adults 
ORENCIA should be administered weekly at a dose of 125 mg by subcutaneous (SC) injection 
without the need for an intravenous (IV) loading dose. 
Patients switching from ORENCIA intravenous therapy to subcutaneous administration should 
administer the first subcutaneous dose instead of the next scheduled intravenous dose. 
Paediatric population 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
The recommended weekly dose of ORENCIA solution for injection in pre-filled syringe for patients 2 
to 17 years of age with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis should be initiated without an 
intravenous loading dose and administered utilizing the weight range-based dosing as specified in the 
table below:

ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution for infusion for intravenous administration is available 
for paediatric patients 6 years of age and older for the treatment of pJIA (see Summary of Product 
Characteristics for ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution for infusion). 
Missed dose 
If a patient misses an injection of abatacept and is within three days of the planned date, he/she should 
be instructed to take the missed dose immediately and remain on the original weekly schedule. If the 
dose is missed by more than three days, the patient should be instructed when to take the next dose 
based on medical judgment (condition of the patient, status of disease activity, etc). 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 4.4). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
ORENCIA has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ORENCIA in children below 2 years of age have not been established. No 
data are available. 
There is no relevant use of ORENCIA in children under two years old. 
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous use. 
ORENCIA is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional. After proper training in 
subcutaneous injection technique, a patient or caregiver may inject with ORENCIA if a 
physician/healthcare professional determines that it is appropriate. 
The total content of the pre-filled syringe should be administered as a subcutaneous injection only. 
Injection sites should be rotated and injections should never be given into areas where the skin is 
tender, bruised, red, or hard. 
Comprehensive instructions for the preparation and administration of ORENCIA in a pre-filled 
syringe are given in the package leaflet and “Important instructions for use”. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Severe and uncontrolled infections such as sepsis and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Combination with TNF-inhibitors 
There is limited experience with use of abatacept in combination with TNF-inhibitors (see 
section 5.1). In placebo-controlled clinical trials, in comparison with patients treated with 
TNF-inhibitors and placebo, patients who received combination TNF-inhibitors with abatacept 
experienced an increase in overall infections and serious infections (see section 4.5). Abatacept is not 
recommended for use in combination with TNF-inhibitors. 
While transitioning from TNF-inhibitor therapy to ORENCIA therapy, patients should be monitored 
for signs of infection (see section 5.1, study VII). 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions have been reported uncommonly with abatacept administration in clinical trials, 
where patients were not required to be pretreated to prevent allergic reactions (see section 4.8). 
Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions can occur after the first infusion and can be life-threatening. In 
postmarketing experience, a case of fatal anaphylaxis following the first infusion of ORENCIA has 
been reported. If any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, intravenous or subcutaneous 
ORENCIA therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated, and the use 
of ORENCIA should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.8). 
Effects on the immune system 
Medicinal products which affect the immune system, including ORENCIA, may affect host defences 
against infections and malignancies, and affect vaccination responses. 
Co-administration of ORENCIA with biologic immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents 
could potentiate the effects of abatacept on the immune system (see section 4.5). 
Infections 
Serious infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, have been reported with abatacept (see 
section 4.8). Some of these infections have been fatal. Many of the serious infections have occurred in 
patients on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy which in addition to their underlying disease, 
could further predispose them to infections. Treatment with ORENCIA should not be initiated in 
patients with active infections until infections are controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when 
considering the use of ORENCIA in patients with a history of recurrent infections or underlying 
conditions which may predispose them to infections. Patients who develop a new infection while 
undergoing treatment with ORENCIA should be monitored closely. Administration of ORENCIA 
should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. 
No increase of tuberculosis was observed in the pivotal placebo-controlled studies; however, all 
ORENCIA patients were screened for tuberculosis. The safety of ORENCIA in individuals with latent 
tuberculosis is unknown. There have been reports of tuberculosis in patients receiving ORENCIA (see 
section 4.8). Patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis prior to initiating ORENCIA. The 
available medical guidelines should also be taken into account. 
Anti-rheumatic therapies have been associated with hepatitis B reactivation. Therefore, screening for 
viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with published guidelines before starting therapy 
with ORENCIA. 
Treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, such as ORENCIA, may be associated with progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If neurological symptoms suggestive of PML occur during 
ORENCIA therapy, treatment with ORENCIA should be discontinued and appropriate diagnostic 
measures initiated. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malignancies 
In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the frequencies of malignancies in abatacept- and placebo-
treated patients were 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively (see section 4.8). Patients with known malignancies 
were not included in these clinical trials. In carcinogenicity studies in mice, an increase in lymphomas 
and mammary tumours were noted. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown (see 
section 5.3). The potential role of abatacept in the development of malignancies, including lymphoma, 
in humans is unknown. There have been reports of non-melanoma skin cancers in patients receiving 
ORENCIA (see section 4.8). Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly 
those with risk factors for skin cancer. 
Vaccinations 
Patients treated with ORENCIA may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Live 
vaccines should not be given concurrently with abatacept or within 3 months of its discontinuation. 
Medicinal products that affect the immune system, including abatacept, may blunt the effectiveness of 
some immunisations (see section 4.5). 
Elderly patients 
A total of 404 patients 65 years of age and older, including 67 patients 75 years and older, received 
intravenous abatacept in placebo-controlled clinical trials. A total of 270 patients 65 years of age and 
older, including 46 patients 75 years and older, received subcutaneous abatacept in controlled clinical 
trials. The frequencies of serious infection and malignancy relative to placebo among intravenous 
abatacept-treated patients over age 65 were higher than among those under age 65. Similarly, the 
frequencies of serious infection and malignancy among subcutaneous abatacept-treated patients over 
age 65 were higher than among those under age 65. Because there is a higher incidence of infections 
and malignancies in the elderly in general, caution should be used when treating the elderly (see 
section 4.8). 
Autoimmune processes 
There is a theoretical concern that treatment with abatacept might increase the risk for autoimmune 
processes in adults, for example deterioration of multiple sclerosis. In the placebo-controlled clinical 
trials, abatacept treatment did not lead to increased autoantibody formation, such as antinuclear and 
anti-dsDNA antibodies, relative to placebo treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.3). 
Patients on controlled sodium diet 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Combination with TNF-inhibitors 
There is limited experience with the use of abatacept in combination with TNF-inhibitors (see 
section 5.1). While TNF-inhibitors did not influence abatacept clearance, in placebo-controlled clinical 
trials, patients receiving concomitant treatment with abatacept and TNF-inhibitors experienced more 
infections and serious infections than patients treated with only TNF-inhibitors. Therefore, concurrent 
therapy with abatacept and a TNF-inhibitor is not recommended. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Combination with other medicinal products 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of methotrexate, NSAIDs, and 
corticosteroids on abatacept clearance (see section 5.2). 
No major safety issues were identified with use of abatacept in combination with sulfasalazine, 
hydroxychloroquine, or leflunomide. 
Combination with other medicinal products that affect the immune system and with vaccinations 
Co-administration of abatacept with biologic immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents could 
potentiate the effects of abatacept on the immune system. There is insufficient evidence to assess the 
safety and efficacy of abatacept in combination with anakinra or rituximab (see section 4.4). 
Vaccinations 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with abatacept or within 3 months of its 
discontinuation. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons 
receiving live vaccines to patients receiving abatacept. Medicinal products that affect the immune 
system, including abatacept, may blunt the effectiveness of some immunisations (see sections 4.4 and 
4.6). 
Exploratory studies to assess the effect of abatacept on the antibody response to vaccination in healthy 
subjects as well as the antibody response to influenza and pneumococcal vaccines in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients suggested that abatacept may blunt the effectiveness of the immune response, but did 
not significantly inhibit the ability to develop a clinically significant or positive immune response. 
Abatacept was evaluated in an open-label study in rheumatoid arthritis patients administered the 
23-valent pneumococcal vaccine. After pneumococcal vaccination, 62 of 112 abatacept-treated 
patients were able to mount an adequate immune response of at least a 2-fold increase in antibody 
titers to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. 
Abatacept was also evaluated in an open-label study in rheumatoid arthritis patients administered the 
seasonal influenza trivalent virus vaccine. After influenza vaccination, 73 of 119 abatacept-treated 
patients without protective antibody levels at baseline were able to mount an adequate immune 
response of at least a 4-fold increase in antibody titers to trivalent influenza vaccine. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy and women of childbearing potential 
There are no adequate data from use of abatacept in pregnant women. In pre-clinical embryo-foetal 
development studies no undesirable effects were observed at doses up to 29-fold a human 10 mg/kg 
dose based on AUC. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, limited changes in immune 
function were observed at 11-fold higher than a human 10 mg/kg dose based on AUC (see 
section 5.3). 
ORENCIA should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with abatacept. Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during 
treatment and up to 14 weeks after the last dose of abatacept. 
Abatacept may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with abatacept 
during pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk of infection. The safety of 
administering live vaccines to infants exposed to abatacept in utero is unknown. Administration of live 
vaccines to infants exposed to abatacept in utero is not recommended for 14 weeks following the 
mother’s last exposure to abatacept during pregnancy. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Abatacept has been shown to be present in rat milk. 
It is unknown whether abatacept is excreted in human milk. 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with ORENCIA and for up to 14 weeks after 
the last dose of abatacept treatment. 
Fertility 
Formal studies of the potential effect of abatacept on human fertility have not been conducted. 
In rats, abatacept had no undesirable effects on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Based on its mechanism of action, abatacept is expected to have no or negligible influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines. However, dizziness and reduced visual acuity have been reported as 
common and uncommon adverse reactions respectively from patients treated with ORENCIA, 
therefore if a patient experiences such symptoms, driving and use of machinery should be avoided. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis 
Abatacept has been studied in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in placebo-controlled clinical 
trials (2,653 patients with abatacept, 1,485 with placebo). 
In placebo-controlled clinical trials with abatacept, adverse reactions (ARs) were reported in 49.4% of 
abatacept-treated patients and 45.8% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse 
reactions (≥ 5%) among abatacept-treated patients were headache, nausea, and upper respiratory tract 
infections (including sinusitis). The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to ARs 
was 3.0% for abatacept-treated patients and 2.0% for placebo-treated patients. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Listed in Table 2 are adverse reactions observed in clinical trials and post-marketing experience 
presented by system organ class and frequency, using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very 
rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
In the placebo-controlled clinical trials with abatacept, infections at least possibly related to treatment 
were reported in 22.7% of abatacept-treated patients and 20.5% of placebo-treated patients. 
Serious infections at least possibly related to treatment were reported in 1.5% of abatacept-treated 
patients and 1.1% of placebo-treated patients. The type of serious infections was similar between the 
abatacept and placebo treatment groups (see section 4.4). 
The incidence rates (95% CI) for serious infections was 3.0 (2.3, 3.8) per 100 patient-years for 
abatacept-treated patients and 2.3 (1.5, 3.3) per 100 patient-years for placebo-treated patients in the 
double-blind studies. 
In the cumulative period in clinical trials in 7,044 patients treated with abatacept during 
20,510 patient-years, the incidence rate of serious infections was 2.4 per 100 patient-years, and the 
annualised incidence rate remained stable.

Malignancies 
In placebo-controlled clinical trials, malignancies were reported in 1.2% (31/2,653) 
of abatacept-treated patients, and in 0.9% (14/1,485) of placebo-treated patients. The incidence rates 
for malignancies was 1.3 (0.9, 1.9) per 100 patient-years for abatacept-treated patients and 1.1 (0.6, 
1.9) per 100 patient-years for placebo-treated patients. 
In the cumulative period 7,044 patients treated with abatacept during 21,011 patient-years (of which 
over 1,000 were treated with abatacept for over 5 years), the incidence rate of malignancy was 
1.2 (1.1, 1.4) per 100 patient-years, and the annualised incidence rates remained stable. 
The most frequently reported malignancy in the placebo-controlled clinical trials was non-melanoma 
skin cancer; 0.6 (0.3, 1.0) per 100 patient-years for abatacept-treated patients and 0.4 (0.1, 0.9) per 
100 patient-years for placebo-treated patients and 0.5 (0.4, 0.6) per 100 patient-years in the cumulative 
period. 
The most frequently reported organ cancer in the placebo-controlled clinical trials was lung cancer 
0.17 (0.05, 0.43) per 100 patient-years for abatacept-treated patients, 0 for placebo-treated patients and 
0.12 (0.08, 0.17) per 100 patient-years in the cumulative period. The most common hematologic 
malignancy was lymphoma 0.04 (0, 0.24) per 100 patient-years for abatacept-treated patients, 0 for 
placebo-treated patients, and 0.06 (0.03, 0.1) per 100 patient-years in the cumulative period. 
Adverse reactions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
In study IV, there were 37 patients with COPD treated with intravenous abatacept and 17 treated with 
placebo. The COPD patients treated with abatacept developed adverse reactions more frequently than 
those treated with placebo (51.4% vs. 47.1%, respectively). Respiratory disorders occurred more 
frequently in abatacept-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (10.8% vs. 5.9%, respectively); 
these included COPD exacerbation, and dyspnoea. A greater percentage of abatacept- than 
placebo-treated patients with COPD developed a serious adverse reaction (5.4% vs. 0%), including 
COPD exacerbation (1 of 37 patients [2.7%]) and bronchitis (1 of 37 patients [2.7%]). 
Autoimmune processes 
Abatacept therapy did not lead to increased formation of autoantibodies, i.e., antinuclear and anti-
dsDNA antibodies, compared with placebo. 
The incidence rate of autoimmune disorders in abatacept-treated patients during the double-blind 
period was 8.8 (7.6, 10.1) per 100 person-years of exposure and for placebo-treated patients was 
9.6 (7.9, 11.5) per 100 person-years of exposure. The incidence rate in abatacept-treated patients was 
3.8 per 100 person-years in the cumulative period. The most frequently reported autoimmune-related 
disorders other than the indication being studied during the cumulative period were psoriasis, 
rheumatoid nodule, and Sjogren's syndrome. 
Immunogenicity in adults treated with intravenous abatacept 
Antibodies directed against the abatacept molecule were assessed by ELISA assays in 3,985 
rheumatoid arthritis patients treated for up to 8 years with abatacept. One hundred and eighty-seven 
of 3,877 (4.8%) patients developed anti-abatacept antibodies while on treatment. In patients assessed 
for anti-abatacept antibodies after discontinuation of abatacept (> 42 days after last dose), 103 of 
1,888 (5.5%) were seropositive. 
Samples with confirmed binding activity to CTLA-4 were assessed for the presence of neutralizing 
antibodies. Twenty-two of 48 evaluable patients showed significant neutralizing activity. The potential 
clinical relevance of neutralizing antibody formation is not known. 
Overall, there was no apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse 
events. However, the number of patients that developed antibodies was too limited to make a 
definitive assessment. Because immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody 
rates with those from other products is not appropriate.

Immunogenicity in adults treated with subcutaneous abatacept 
Study SC-I compared the immunogenicity to abatacept following subcutaneous or intravenous 
administration as assessed by ELISA assay. During the initial double blind 6 months period 
(short-term period), the overall immunogenicity frequency to abatacept was 1.1% (8/725) and 
2.3% (16/710) for the subcutaneous and intravenous groups, respectively. The rate is consistent with 
previous experience, and there was no effect of immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics, safety, or 
efficacy. 
Immunogenicity to abatacept following long-term subcutaneous administration was assessed by a new 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay. Comparison of incidence rates across different assays is not 
appropriate, as the ECL assay was developed to be more sensitive and drug tolerant than the previous 
ELISA assay. The cumulative immunogenicity frequency to abatacept by the ECL assay with at least 
one positive sample in the short-term and long-term periods combined was 15.7% (215/1369) while on 
abatacept, with a mean duration of exposure of 48.8 months, and 17.3% (194/1121) after 
discontinuation (> 21 days up to 168 days after last dose). The exposure adjusted incidence rate 
(expressed per 100 person-years) remained stable over the treatment duration. 
Consistent with previous experience, titers and persistence of antibody responses were generally low 
and did not increase upon continued dosing (6.8% subjects were seropositive on 2 consecutive visits), 
and there was no apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response, adverse events, or 
pharmacokinetics. 
In study SC-III, similar immunogenicity rates were seen in patients on treatment for the 
abatacept+MTX, and abatacept monotherapy groups (2.9% (3/103) and 5.0% (5/101), respectively) 
during the double-blind 12-month period. As in study SC-I, there was no effect of immunogenicity on 
safety or efficacy. 
Immunogenicity and safety of abatacept upon withdrawal and restart of treatment 
A study in the subcutaneous program was conducted to investigate the effect of withdrawal (three 
months) and restart of abatacept subcutaneous treatment on immunogenicity. Upon withdrawal of 
abatacept subcutaneous treatment, the increased rate of immunogenicity was consistent with that seen 
upon discontinuation of abatacept administered intravenously. Upon reinitiating therapy, there were no 
injection reactions and no other safety concerns in patients who were withdrawn from subcutaneous 
therapy for up to 3 months relative to those who remained on subcutaneous therapy, whether therapy 
was reintroduced with or without an intravenous loading dose. The safety observed in the treatment 
arm that reinitiated therapy without an intravenous loading dose was also consistent with that observed 
in the other studies. 
In SC-III, increased rates of immunogenicity were observed in subjects tested during 6 months of 
complete drug withdrawal in the abatacept+MTX and abatacept monotherapy groups (37.7% [29/77] 
and 44.1% [27/59], respectively) with generally low titer antibody responses. No clinical impact of 
these antibody responses was detected, and no safety concerns were observed upon reinitiation of 
abatacept therapy. 
Injection Reactions in adult patients treated with subcutaneous abatacept 
Study SC-I compared the safety of abatacept including injection site reactions following subcutaneous 
or intravenous administration. The overall frequency of injection site reactions was 2.6% (19/736) and 
2.5% (18/721) for the subcutaneous abatacept group and the subcutaneous placebo group (intravenous 
abatacept), respectively. All injection site reactions were described as mild to moderate (hematoma, 
pruritus, or erythema) and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. During the cumulative 
study period when all subjects treated with abatacept in 7 SC studies were included, the frequency of 
injection site reactions was 4.6% (116/2,538) with an incidence rate of 1.32 per 100 person-years. 
Postmarketing reports of systemic injection reactions (e.g. pruritus, throat tightness, dyspnoea) have 
been received following the use of subcutaneous ORENCIA.

Safety information related to the pharmacological class 
Abatacept is the first selective co-stimulation modulator. Information on the relative safety in a 
clinical trial versus infliximab is summarized in section 5.1. 
Summary of the safety profile in psoriatic arthritis 
Abatacept has been studied in patients with active psoriatic arthritis in two placebo-controlled clinical 
trials (341 patients with abatacept, 253 patients with placebo) (see Section 5.1). During the 24-week 
placebo-controlled period in the larger study PsA-II, the proportion of patients with adverse reactions 
was similar in the abatacept and placebo treatment groups (15.5% and 11.4%, respectively). There 
were no adverse reactions that occurred at ≥ 2% in either treatment group during the 24-week 
placebo-controlled period. The overall safety profile was comparable between studies PsA-I and 
PsA-II and consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis (Table 2). 
Paediatric population 
Abatacept has been studied in patients with pJIA in 2 clinical trials (ongoing pJIA SC study and pJIA 
IV study). The pJIA SC study included 46 patients in the 2 to 5 year age cohort and 173 patients in 
the 6 to 17 year age cohort. The pJIA IV study included 190 patients in the 6 to 17 year age cohort. 
During the first 4-month open-label period, the overall safety profile in these 409 pJIA patients was 
similar to that observed in the RA population with the following exceptions in the pJIA patients: 
 
 
Common adverse reactions: pyrexia 
Uncommon adverse reactions: haematuria, otitis (media and externa). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
Infections were the most commonly reported adverse events in patients with pJIA. The types of 
infections were consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric populations. During the 
first 4-month treatment period of intravenous and subcutaneous abatacept in 409 patients with pJIA, 
the most common adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis (3.7% patients) and upper respiratory tract 
infection (2.9% patients). Two serious infections (varicella and sepsis) were reported during the initial 
4 months of treatment with abatacept. 
Injection reactions 
Of the 219 patients with pJIA treated with subcutaneous abatacept during the first 4-month abatacept 
treatment, the frequency of local injection reactions was 4.6% (10/219); injection site pain and 
injection site erythema were the most frequently reported local injection reactions. No systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions were reported. 
Immunogenicity in patients with pJIA treated with subcutaneous abatacept 
Antibodies directed against the whole abatacept molecule or to the CTLA-4 portion of abatacept were 
assessed by an ECL assay in patients with pJIA following repeated treatment with subcutaneous 
abatacept. Overall, 6.9% (15/218) of subjects (cohorts combined) had a positive immunogenicity 
response relative to baseline during the cumulative period, including the 4-month short-term treatment 
period, 20-month extension treatment period and the 6-month post abatacept follow-up period. In the 
6 to 17 year age cohort, the overall rate of seropositivity during the cumulative period including post 
abatacept follow-up was 4.7% (8/172): 2.3% (4/172) on treatment and 13.6% (6/44) after 
discontinuation of abatacept (≥ 28 days after the last dose). In the 2 to 5 year age cohort, the overall 
rate of seropositivity during the cumulative period including post abatacept follow-up was 
15.2% (7/46): 10.9% (5/46) on treatment and 37.5% (3/8) after discontinuation of abatacept (≥ 28 days 
after the last dose). 
Overall antibodies against abatacept were generally transient and of low titer. The absence of 
concomitant methotrexate did not appear to be associated with a higher rate of seropositivity. The 
significance of the higher incidence in the 2 to 5 year age cohort is unknown, taking into account the 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
difference in sample size. The presence of antibodies was not associated with adverse reactions, or 
with changes in efficacy or serum abatacept concentrations, in either cohort. 
Long-term extension period 
During the extension period of the pJIA studies (20 months in the pJIA ongoing SC study and 5 years 
in the pJIA IV study), the safety profile in the pJIA patients aged 6 to 17 years was comparable to that 
seen in adult patients. One patient was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis while in the extension period 
of the pJIA IV study. One serious adverse reaction of infection (limb abscess) was reported in the 2 to 
5 year age cohort during the 20-month extension period of the pJIA SC study. 
Long-term safety data in 2 to 5 year age cohort with pJIA was limited, but the existing evidence did 
not reveal any new safety concern in this younger paediatric population. During the 24-month 
cumulative period of the pJIA SC study (4-month short-term period plus 20-month extension period), 
a higher frequency of infections was reported in the 2 to 5 year age cohort (87.0%) compared to that 
reported in the 6 to 17 year age cohort (68.2%). This was mostly due to non-serious upper respiratory 
tract infections in the 2 to 5 year age cohort. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 50 mg/kg have been administered intravenously without apparent toxic effect. In case of 
overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse 
reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: 
L04AA24 
Abatacept is a fusion protein that consists of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic 
T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) linked to a modified Fc portion of human 
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Abatacept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese 
hamster ovary cells. 
Mechanism of action 
Abatacept selectively modulates a key costimulatory signal required for full activation of T 
lymphocytes expressing CD28. Full activation of T lymphocytes requires two signals provided by 
antigen presenting cells: recognition of a specific antigen by a T cell receptor (signal 1) and a second, 
costimulatory signal. A major costimulatory pathway involves the binding of CD80 and 
CD86 molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells to the CD28 receptor on T lymphocytes 
(signal 2). Abatacept selectively inhibits this costimulatory pathway by specifically binding to 
CD80 and CD86. Studies indicate that naive T lymphocyte responses are more affected by abatacept 
than memory T lymphocyte responses. 
Studies in vitro and in animal models demonstrate that abatacept modulates T lymphocyte-dependent 
antibody responses and inflammation. In vitro, abatacept attenuates human T lymphocyte activation as 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measured by decreased proliferation and cytokine production. Abatacept decreases antigen specific 
TNFα, interferon-γ, and interleukin-2 production by T lymphocytes. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Dose-dependent reductions were observed with abatacept in serum levels of soluble 
interleukin-2 receptor, a marker of T lymphocyte activation; serum interleukin-6, a product of 
activated synovial macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatoid 
factor, an autoantibody produced by plasma cells; and C-reactive protein, an acute phase reactant of 
inflammation. In addition, serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3, which produces cartilage 
destruction and tissue remodelling, were decreased. Reductions in serum TNFα were also observed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in adult rheumatoid arthritis 
The efficacy and safety of intravenous abatacept were assessed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trials in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to 
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Studies I, II, III, V, and VI required patients to 
have at least 12 tender and 10 swollen joints at randomisation. Study IV did not require any specific 
number of tender or swollen joints. Study SC-I was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy non-
inferiority study administered to patients stratified by body weight (< 60 kg, 60 to 100 kg, > 100 kg) 
that compared the efficacy and safety of abatacept administered subcutaneously and intravenously in 
subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), receiving background methotrexate (MTX), and experiencing 
an inadequate response to MTX (MTX-IR). 
In studies I, II, and V the efficacy and safety of abatacept compared to placebo were assessed in 
patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate and who continued on their stable dose of 
methotrexate. In addition, study V investigated the safety and efficacy of abatacept or infliximab 
relative to placebo. In study III the efficacy and safety of abatacept were assessed in patients with an 
inadequate response to a TNF-inhibitor, with the TNF-inhibitor discontinued prior to randomisation; 
other DMARDs were permitted. Study IV primarily assessed safety in patients with active rheumatoid 
arthritis requiring additional intervention in spite of current therapy with non-biological and/or 
biological DMARDs; all DMARDs used at enrollment were continued. In study VI, the efficacy and 
safety of abatacept were assessed in methotrexate-naive, Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and/or anti-Cyclic 
Citrullinated Peptide 2 (Anti-CCP2)-positive patients with early, erosive rheumatoid arthritis 
(≤ 2 years disease duration) who were randomised to receive abatacept plus methotrexate or 
methotrexate plus placebo. In study SC-I, the goal was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the efficacy 
and comparability of the safety of abatacept subcutaneous relative to intravenous administration in 
subjects with moderate to severely active RA and experiencing inadequate response to MTX. Study 
SC-II investigated the relative efficacy and safety of abatacept and adalimumab, both given 
subcutaneously without an intravenous loading dose and with background MTX, in patients with 
moderate to severely active RA and an inadequate response to previous MTX therapy. In study SC-III, 
abatacept subcutaneous was evaluated in combination with methotrexate, or as abatacept 
monotherapy, and compared to MTX monotherapy in induction of remission following 12 months of 
treatment, and the possible maintenance of drug-free remission after complete drug withdrawal, in 
adult MTX-naive patients with highly active early rheumatoid arthritis (mean DAS28-CRP of 5.4; 
mean symptom duration less than 6.7 months) with poor prognostic factors for rapidly progressive 
disease (e.g. anti-citrullinated protein antibodies [ACPA+], as measured by anti-CCP2 assay, and/or 
RF+, baseline joint erosions). 
Study I patients were randomised to receive abatacept 2 or 10 mg/kg or placebo for 12 months. 
Study II, III, IV, and VI patients were randomised to receive a fixed dose approximating 10 mg/kg of 
abatacept or placebo for 12 (studies II, IV, and VI) or 6 months (study III). The dose of abatacept 
was 500 mg for patients weighing less than 60 kg, 750 mg for patients weighing 60 to 100 kg, and 
1,000 mg for patients weighing greater than 100 kg. In study SC-I, abatacept was given 
subcutaneously to patients after a single loading dose of intravenous abatacept and then every week 
thereafter. Subjects continued taking their current dose of MTX from the day of randomisation. 
Study V patients were randomised to receive this same fixed dose of abatacept or 3 mg/kg infliximab 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or placebo for 6 months. Study V continued for an additional 6 months with the abatacept and 
infliximab groups only. 
Studies I, II, III, IV, V, VI, SC-I, SC-II, and SC-III evaluated 339, 638, 389, 1441, 431, 509, 1371, 
646, and 351 adult patients, respectively. 
Clinical response 
ACR response 
The percent of abatacept-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50, and 70 responses in study II (patients 
with inadequate response to methotrexate), study III (patients with inadequate response to TNF-
inhibitor), study VI (methotrexate-naive patients), and study SC-I (subcutaneous abatacept) are shown 
in Table 3. 
In abatacept-treated patients in studies II and III, statistically significant improvement in the 
ACR 20 response versus placebo was observed after administration of the first dose (day 15), and this 
improvement remained significant for the duration of the studies. In study VI, statistically significant 
improvement in the ACR 20 response in abatacept plus methotrexate-treated patients versus 
methotrexate plus placebo-treated patients was observed at 29 days, and was maintained through the 
duration of the study. In study II, 43% of the patients who had not achieved an ACR 20 response 
at 6 months developed an ACR 20 response at 12 months. 
In study SC-I, abatacept administered subcutaneously (SC) was non-inferior relative to intravenous 
IV infusions of abatacept with respect to ACR 20 responses up to 6 months of treatment. Patients 
treated with abatacept subcutaneously also achieved similar ACR 50 and 70 responses as those 
patients receiving abatacept intravenously at 6 months. 
No difference in clinical response between subcutaneous and intravenous abatacept was seen across 
the 3 weight groups. In SC-I, the ACR 20 response rates at day 169 for subcutaneous and intravenous 
abatacept were respectively 78.3% (472/603 SC) and 76.0% (456/600 IV) in patients < 65 years, 
versus 61.1% (55/90 SC) and 74.4% (58/78 IV) for patients ≥ 65 years.

In the open-label extension of studies I, II, III, VI, and SC-I durable and sustained ACR 20, 50, 
and 70 responses have been observed through 7 years, 5 years, 5 years, 2 years, and 5 years, 
respectively, of abatacept treatment. In study I, ACR responses were assessed at 7 years in 43 patients 
with 72% ACR 20 responses, 58% ACR 50 responses, and 44% ACR 70 responses. In study II, ACR 
responses were assessed at 5 years in 270 patients with 84% ACR 20 responses, 61% ACR 50 
responses, and 40% ACR 70 responses. In study III, ACR responses were assessed at 5 years in 
91 patients with 74% ACR 20 responses, 51% ACR 50 responses, and 23% ACR 70 responses. In 
study VI, ACR responses were assessed at 2 years in 232 patients with 85% ACR 20 responses, 74% 
ACR 50 responses, and 54% ACR 70 responses. In study SC-I, ACR responses were assessed at

45% (191/425) ACR 70 responses. 
Greater improvements were seen with abatacept than with placebo in other measures of rheumatoid 
arthritis disease activity not included in the ACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. 
DAS28 response 
Disease activity was also assessed using the Disease Activity Score 28. There was a significant 
improvement of DAS in studies II, III, V, and VI as compared to placebo or comparator. 
In study VI, which only included adults, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the abatacept 
plus methotrexate group (41%) achieved DAS28 (CRP)-defined remission (score < 2.6) versus the 
methotrexate plus placebo group (23%) at year 1. The response at year 1 in the abatacept group was 
maintained through year 2. 
Study V: abatacept or infliximab versus placebo 
A randomised, double-blind study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous 
abatacept or infliximab versus placebo in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate 
(study V). The primary outcome was the mean change in disease activity in abatacept-treated patients 
compared to placebo-treated patients at 6 months with a subsequent double-blind assessment of safety 
and efficacy of abatacept and infliximab at 12 months. Greater improvement (p < 0.001) in 
DAS28 was observed with abatacept and with infliximab compared to placebo at six months in the 
placebo-controlled portion of the trial; the results between the abatacept and infliximab groups were 
similar. The ACR responses in study V were consistent with the DAS28 score. Further improvement 
was observed at 12 months with abatacept. At 6 months, the incidence of AE of infections were 
48.1% (75), 52.1% (86), and 51.8% (57) and the incidence of serious AE of infections were 1.3% (2), 
4.2% (7), and 2.7% (3) for abatacept, infliximab and placebo groups, respectively. At 12 months, the 
incidence of AE of infections were 59.6% (93), 68.5% (113), and the incidence of serious AE of 
infections were 1.9% (3) and 8.5% (14) for abatacept and infliximab groups, respectively. The open 
label period of the study provided an assessment of the ability of abatacept to maintain efficacy for 
subjects originally randomised to abatacept and the efficacy response of those subjects who were 
switched to abatacept following treatment with infliximab. The reduction from baseline in mean 
DAS28 score at day 365 (-3.06) was maintained through day 729 (-3.34) in those patients who 
continued with abatacept. In those patients who initially received infliximab and then switched to 
abatacept, the reduction in the mean DAS28 score from baseline were 3.29 at day 729 and 2.48 at 
day 365. 
Study SC-II: abatacept versus adalimumab 
A randomised, single (investigator)-blinded, non-inferiority study was conducted to assess the safety 
and efficacy of weekly subcutaneous (SC) abatacept without an abatacept intravenous (IV) loading 
dose versus every-other-weekly subcutaneous adalimumab, both with background MTX, in patients 
with an inadequate response to methotrexate (study SC-II). The primary endpoint showed 
non-inferiority (predefined margin of 12%) of ACR20 response after 12 months of treatment, 
64.8% (206/318) for the abatacept SC group and 63.4% (208/328) for the adalimumab SC group; 
treatment difference was 1.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): -5.6, 9.2], with comparable responses 
throughout the 24-month period. The respective values for ACR 20 at 24 months were 
59.7% (190/318) for the abatacept SC group and 60.1% (197/328) for the adalimumab SC group. The 
respective values for ACR 50 and ACR 70 at 12 months and 24 months were consistent and similar for 
abatacept and adalimumab. The adjusted mean changes (standard error; SE) from baseline in 
DAS28-CRP were -2.35 (SE 0.08) [95% CI: -2.51, -2.19] and -2.33 (SE 0.08) [95% CI: -2.50, -2.17] 
in the SC abatacept group and the adalimumab group, respectively, at 24 months, with similar changes 
over time. At 24 months, 50.6% (127/251) [95% CI: 44.4, 56.8] of patients in abatacept and 
53.3% (130/244) [95% CI: 47.0, 59.5] of patients in adalimumab groups achieved DAS 28 < 2.6. 
Improvement from baseline as measured by HAQ-DI at 24 months and over time was also similar 
between abatacept SC and adalimumab SC. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety and structural damage assessments were conducted at one and two years. The overall safety 
profile with respect to adverse reactions was similar between the two groups over the 24-month 
period. After 24 months, adverse reactions were reported in 41.5% (132/318) and 50% (164/328) of 
abatacept and adalimumab-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 3.5% (11/318) 
and 6.1% (20/328) of the respective group. At 24 months, 20.8% (66/318) of patients on abatacept and 
25.3% (83/328) on adalimumab had discontinued. 
In SC-II, serious infections were reported in 3.8% (12/318) of patients treated with abatacept SC 
weekly, none of which led to discontinuation and in 5.8% (19/328) of patients treated with 
adalimumab SC every-other-week, leading to 9 discontinuations in the 24-month period. 
The frequency of local injection site reactions was 3.8% (12/318) and 9.1% (30/328) at 12 months 
(p = 0.006) and 4.1% (13/318) and 10.4% (34/328) at 24 months for abatacept SC and adalimumab 
SC, respectively. Over the 2 year study period, 3.8% (12/318) and 1.5% (5/328) patients treated with 
abatacept SC and adalimumab SC respectively reported autoimmune disorders mild to moderate in 
severity (e.g., psoriasis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, erythema nodosum). 
Study SC-III: Induction of remission in methotrexate-naive RA patients 
A randomised and double-blinded study evaluated abatacept SC in combination with methotrexate 
(abatacept + MTX), abatacept SC monotherapy, or methotrexate monotherapy (MTX group) in 
induction of remission following 12 months of treatment, and maintenance of drug-free remission after 
complete drug withdrawal in MTX-naive adult patients with highly active early rheumatoid arthritis 
with poor prognostic factors. Complete drug withdrawal led to loss of remission (return to disease 
activity) in all three treatment arms (abatacept with methotrexate, abatacept or methotrexate alone) in a 
majority of patients (Table 4).

In SC-III the safety profiles of the three treatment groups (abatacept + MTX, abatacept monotherapy, 
MTX group) were overall similar. During the 12-month treatment period, adverse reactions were 
reported in 44.5% (53/119), 41.4% (48/116), and 44.0% (51/116) and serious adverse reactions were

reported in 2.5% (3/119), 2.6% (3/116) and 0.9% (1/116) of patients treated in the three treatment 
groups, respectively. Serious infections were reported in 0.8% (1/119), 3.4% (4/116) and 0% (0/116) 
patients. 
Radiographic response 
Structural joint damage was assessed radiographically over a two-year period in studies II, VI, and 
SC-II. The results were measured using the Genant-modified total Sharp score (TSS) and its 
components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing (JSN) score. 
In study II, the baseline median TSS was 31.7 in abatacept-treated patients and 33.4 in placebo-treated 
patients. Abatacept/methotrexate reduced the rate of progression of structural damage compared to 
placebo/methotrexate after 12 months of treatment as shown in Table 5. The rate of progression of 
structural damage in year 2 was significantly lower than that in year 1 for patients randomised to 
abatacept (p < 0.0001). Subjects entering the long term extension after 1 year of double blind 
treatment all received abatacept treatment and radiographic progression was investigated through 
year 5. Data were analysed in an as-observed analysis using mean change in total score from the 
previous annual visit. The mean change was, 0.41 and 0.74 from year 1 to year 2 (n = 290, 130), 
0.37 and 0.68 from year 2 to year 3 (n = 293, 130), 0.34 and 0.43 from year 3 to year 4 (n = 290, 128) 
and the change was 0.26 and 0.29 (n = 233, 114) from year 4 to year 5 for patients originally 
randomised to abatacept plus MTX and placebo plus MTX respectively.

a Based on non-parametric analysis. 
In study VI, the mean change in TSS at 12 months was significantly lower in patients treated with 
abatacept plus methotrexate compared to those treated with methotrexate plus placebo. At 12 months 
61% (148/242) of the patients treated with abatacept plus methotrexate and 53% (128/242) of the 
patients treated with methotrexate plus placebo had no progression (TSS ≤ 0). The progression of 
structural damage was lower in patients receiving continuous abatacept plus methotrexate treatment 
(for 24 months) compared to patients who initially received methotrexate plus placebo (for 12 months) 
and were switched to abatacept plus methotrexate for the next 12 months. Among the patients who 
entered the open-label 12-month period, 59% (125/213) of patients receiving continuous abatacept 
plus methotrexate treatment and 48% (92/192) of patients who initially received methotrexate and 
switched to combination with abatacept had no progression. 
In study SC-II, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as a change from 
baseline in the van der Heijde-modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components. Similar 
inhibition was observed in both treatment groups up to 24 months (mTSS (mean ± standard deviation 
[SD] = 0.89 ±4.13 vs 1.13 ±8.66), erosion score (0.41 ±2.57 vs 0.41 ±5.04), and JSN score (0.48 ±2.18 
vs 0.72 ±3.81)) for the abatacept (n = 257) and adalimumab (n = 260) groups, respectively. 
In study SC-III, structural joint damage was assessed by MRI. The abatacept + MTX group had less 
progression in structural damage compared with MTX group as reflected by mean treatment difference 
of the abatacept + MTX group versus MTX group (Table 6).

difference vs. MTX group of 21.6% [95% CI: 8.3, 34.9]). 
Health-related outcomes and quality of life 
Health-related quality of life was assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire at 6 months in studies I, II, and 
III and at 12 months in studies I and II. In these studies, clinically and statistically significant 
improvement was observed in the abatacept group as compared with the placebo group in 
all 8 domains of the SF-36 (4 physical domains: physical function, role physical, bodily pain, general 
health; and 4 mental domains: vitality, social function, role emotional, mental health), as well as the 
Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In study VI, 
improvement was observed at 12 months in abatacept plus methotrexate group as compared with the 
methotrexate plus placebo group in both PCS and MCS, and was maintained through 2 years. 
Study VII: Safety of abatacept in patients with or without washout of previous TNF-inhibitor therapy 
A study of open-label intravenous abatacept on a background of nonbiologic DMARDs was conducted 
in patients with active RA who had an inadequate response to previous (washout for at least 2 months; 
n = 449) or current (no washout period; n = 597) TNF-inhibitor therapy (study VII). The primary 
outcome, incidence of AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs during 6 months of treatment, was 
similar between those who were previous and current TNF-inhibitor users at enrollment, as was the 
frequency of serious infections. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in adult psoriatic arthritis 
The efficacy and safety of abatacept were assessed in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trials (studies PsA-I and PsA-II) in adult patients, age 18 years and older. Patients had 
active PsA (≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) despite prior treatment with DMARD therapy and 
had one qualifying psoriatic skin lesion of at least 2 cm in diameter. 
In study PsA-I, 170 patients received placebo or abatacept intravenously on day 1, 15, 29, and then 
every 28 days thereafter in a double blind manner for 24 weeks, followed by open-label abatacept 
10 mg/kg intravenous every 28 days. Patients were randomised to receive placebo or abatacept 
3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or two doses of 30 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg, without escape for 24 weeks, 
followed by open label abatacept 10 mg/kg monthly intravenous every month. Patients were allowed 
to receive stable doses of concomitant methotrexate, low dose corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg 
of prednisone) and/or NSAIDs during the trial. 
In study PsA-II, 424 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive in a double-blind manner weekly doses 
of subcutaneous placebo or abatacept 125 mg without a loading dose for 24 weeks, followed by 
open-label abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous weekly. Patients were allowed to receive stable doses of 
concomitant methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, low dose corticosteroids 
(equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone) and/or NSAIDs during the trial. Patients who had not achieved 
at least a 20% improvement from baseline in their swollen and tender joint counts by Week 16 
escaped to open-label abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous weekly. 
The primary endpoint for both PsA-I and PsA-II was the proportion of patients achieving ACR 20 
response at Week 24 (day 169).

A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved an ACR 20 response after treatment with 
abatacept 10 mg/kg intravenous in PsA-I or 125 mg subcutaneous in PsA-II compared to placebo at 
Week 24 in the overall study populations. Higher ACR 20 responses were observed with abatacept vs 
placebo regardless of prior TNF-inhibitor treatment in both studies. In the smaller study PsA-I, the 
ACR 20 responses with abatacept 10 mg/kg intravenous vs placebo in patients who were TNF 
inhibitor-naive were 55.6% vs 20.0%, respectively, and in patients who were TNF 
inhibitor-experienced were 30.8% vs 16.7%, respectively. In study PsA-II, the ACR 20 responses with 
abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous vs placebo in patients who were TNF inhibitor-naive were 44.0% vs 
22.2%, respectively (21.9 [8.3, 35.6], estimate of difference [95% CI]), and in patients who were TNF 
inhibitor-experienced were 36.4% vs 22.3%, respectively (14.0 [3.3, 24.8], estimate of difference 
[95% CI]). 
Higher ACR 20 responses in study PsA-II were seen with abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous vs. placebo 
irrespective of concomitant non-biological DMARD treatment. The ACR 20 responses with abatacept 
125 mg subcutaneous vs placebo in patients who did not use non-biological DMARDs were 27.3% vs 
12.1%, respectively, (15.15 [1.83, 28.47], estimate of difference [95% CI]), and in patients who had 
used non-biological DMARDs were 44.9% vs 26.9%, respectively, (18.00 [7.20, 28.81], estimate of 
difference [95% CI]). Clinical responses were maintained or continued to improve up to one year in 
studies PsA-I and PsA-II. 
Structural response 
In study PsA-II, the proportion of radiographic non-progressors (≤ 0 change from baseline) in total 
PsA-modified SHS on x-rays at Week 24 was greater with abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous (42.7%) 
than placebo (32.7%) (10.0 [1.0, 19.1] estimate of difference [95% CI]). 
Physical Function Response 
In study PsA-I, the proportion of patients with ≥ 0.30 decrease from baseline in HAQ-DI score was 
45.0% with intravenous abatacept vs 19.0% with placebo (26.1 [6.8, 45.5], estimate of difference 
[95% CI]) at Week 24. In study PsA-II, the proportion of patients with at least ≥ 0.35 decrease from 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline in HAQ-DI was 31.0% with abatacept vs. 23.7% with placebo (7.2 [-1.1, 15.6], estimate of 
difference [95% CI]). Improvement in HAQ-DI scores was maintained or improved for up to 1 year 
with continuing abatacept treatment in both PsA-I and PsA-II studies. 
No significant changes in PASI scores with abatacept treatment were seen over the 24-week 
double-blind period. Patients entering the two PsA studies had mild to moderate psoriasis with median 
PASI scores of 8.6 in PsA-I and 4.5 in PsA-II. In study PsA-I, the proportions of patients achieving 
PASI 50 response was 28.6% with abatacept vs. 14.3% with placebo (14.3 [-15.3, 43.9], estimate of 
difference [95% CI]), and the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 75 response was 14.3% with 
abatacept vs. 4.8% with placebo (9.5 [-13.0, 32.0], estimate of difference [95% CI]). In study PsA-II, 
the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 50 response was 26.7% with abatacept vs. 19.6% with 
placebo (7.3 [-2.2, 16.7], estimate of difference [95% CI]), and the proportion of patients who 
achieved PASI 75 response was 16.4% with abatacept vs. 10.1% with placebo (6.4 [-1.3, 14.1], 
estimate of difference [95% CI]). 
Paediatric population in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Subcutaneous 
The efficacy of subcutaneous abatacept in children 2 to 17 years of age is based on pharmacokinetic 
exposure and extrapolation of established efficacy from intravenous abatacept in pJIA patients and 
subcutaneous abatacept in adult patients with RA, and is supported by data from an ongoing clinical 
study. In this study children and adolescents with moderately to severely active pJIA, ages 2 to 
17 years (46 patients in the 2 to 5 year age cohort and 173 patients in the 6 to 17 year age cohort) with 
an inadequate response or intolerance to at least one DMARD, which may have included biologic 
agents, were treated. The safety and efficacy of subcutaneous abatacept were assessed in a single-arm, 
open-label study designed with a primary endpoint of steady-state trough concentration (cmin) at 
4 months (short-term period) in the 6 to 17 year age cohort. Patients continued abatacept treatment in 
an ongoing open-label extension, which assessed long-term safety and efficacy for an additional 
20 months. 
At baseline 79% of 219 patients enrolled and treated in the study were taking methotrexate (mean dose 
at study entry, 12.3 mg/m2/week) and 21% of patients received abatacept monotherapy. Of the 
219 patients entering the study, 56 (25.6%) had previously been treated with biologic DMARD 
therapy (including TNF inhibitors and tocilizumab). 
Patients entered in the trial were a mean 10.6 years of age with mean disease duration of 2.4 years. 
They had active disease, with a mean active joint count of 11.8, mean number of joints with loss of 
motion of 10.3, and a mean elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 1.24 mg/dL at baseline. 
Of the 219 patients treated, 205 completed the short-term period and 200 entered the ongoing long-
term extension period. In the 2 to 5 year age cohort, 39 (84.8%) patients completed 2 years. In the 6 to 
17 year age cohort 132 (76.3%) patients completed 2 years. 
Response rates at the end of the short-term exposure are summarised in Table 9:

The ACRP responses and inactive disease results were maintained through 2 years. 
Intravenous 
Children and adolescents with moderate to severe active pJIA, ages 6 to 17 years with an inadequate 
response or intolerance to at least one DMARD, which may have included biologic agents, were 
enrolled. The safety and efficacy of intravenous abatacept were assessed in a three-part study. 
Period A was a 4-month open-label lead-in designed to induce an ACR Pedi 30 response. Patients 
achieving at least a ACR Pedi 30 response at the end of Period A were randomised into a double-
blind, withdrawal phase (Period B), and received either abatacept or placebo for 6 months or until 
pJIA disease flare as defined in the study. Unless they had discontinued due to safety reasons, all 
patients who completed, or had a flare during Period B or were non-responders in Period A were 
offered entry into Period C, the open-label extension, which assessed long-term safety and efficacy. 
In Period A all patients received 10 mg/kg of abatacept on days 1, 15, 29, 57 and 85 and were assessed 
on day 113. During period A, 74% were taking methotrexate (mean dose at study entry, 
13.2 mg/m2/week) thus, 26% of patients received abatacept monotherapy in Period A. Of the 
190 patients entering the study, 57 (30%) had previously been treated with TNF-inhibitor therapy. 
ACR Pedi 30 responders at the end of Period A were randomised into Period B, the double-blind, 
withdrawal phase, to receive either abatacept or placebo for 6 months or until JIA flare. 
Flare was defined as: 
 
 
 
≥ 30% worsening in at least 3 of the 6 pJIA core set variables 
≥ 30% improvement in not more than 1 of the 6 pJIA core set variables 
≥ 2 cm (possible up to 10 cm) of worsening must have been present if the Physician or Parent 
Global Assessment was used to define flare 
worsening in ≥ 2 joints must have been present if the number of active joints or joints with 
limited range of motion was used to define flare 
 
The patients entered in the trial were a mean of 12.4 years of age with mean disease duration of 
4.4 years. They had active disease, with baseline mean active joint count of 16 and a mean number of 
joints with loss of motion of 16; and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (mean, 3.2 mg/dL) and 
ESRs (mean, 32 mm/h). Their pJIA subtypes at disease onset were: oligoarticular (16%), polyarticular 
(64%; 20% of the total were rheumatoid factor positive), and systemic (20%). 
Of the 190 patients enrolled, 170 completed Period A, 65% (123/190) achieved an ACR Pedi 30 
response, and 122 were randomised to Period B. Responses were similar in all subtypes of pJIA 
studied and for patients with or without methotrexate use. Of the 133 (70%) patients with no prior 
TNF-inhibitor therapy, 101 (76%) achieved at least an ACR Pedi 30 response; of the 57 patients who 
had received prior TNF-inhibitor therapy, 22 (39%) achieved at least an ACR Pedi 30 response. 
During Period B, the time to disease flare for the patients randomised to placebo was significantly 
shorter than for those randomised to abatacept (primary endpoint, p = 0.0002; log-rank test). 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Significantly more placebo recipients flared during Period B (33/62; 53%) than those maintained on 
abatacept (12/60; 20%; chi-square p < 0.001). The risk of disease flare for patients continuing on 
abatacept was less than one third that for placebo-treated patients (hazard ratio estimate = 0.31; 
95% CI 0.16, 0.59). 
Most randomised Period B patients entered Period C (58/60 Period B abatacept recipients; 59/62 
Period B placebo recipients), as did 36 of the 47 Period A non-responders (n = 153 total patients). 
Response rates at the end of Period A, at the end of Period B and after 5 years exposure in Period C 
are summarized in Table 10:

Participants in Period C at day 1765 included 33 of the 58 Period B abatacept recipients, 30 of the 59 
Period B placebo recipients, and 13 of the 36 Period A non-responders. The median duration of 
abatacept treatment in Period C was 1815 days (range 57–2,415 days; nearly 61 months). One hundred 
and two (67%) of the subjects had received at least 1,080 days (~ 36 months) of abatacept therapy in 
Period C. All patients had at least 4 months of prior, open-label abatacept treatment in Period A. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Adult rheumatoid arthritis 
The geometric mean estimate (90% confidence interval) for the bioavailability of abatacept following 
subcutaneous administration relative to intravenous administration is 78.6% (64.7%, 95.6%). The 
mean (range) for cmin and cmax at steady state observed after 85 days of treatment was 
32.5 mcg/mL (6.6 to 113.8 mcg/mL) and 48.1 mcg/mL (9.8 to 132.4 mcg/mL), respectively. Mean 
estimates for systemic clearance (0.28 mL/h/kg), volume of distribution (0.11 L/kg), and terminal half-
life (14.3 days) were comparable between subcutaneous and intravenous administration. 
A single study was conducted to determine the effect of monotherapy use of abatacept on 
immunogenicity following subcutaneous administration without an intravenous load. When the 
intravenous loading dose was not administered, a mean trough concentration of 12.6 mcg/mL was 
achieved after 2 weeks of dosing. The efficacy response over time in this study appeared consistent 
with studies that included an intravenous loading dose, however, the effect of no intravenous load on 
the onset of efficacy has not been formally studied. 
Consistent with the intravenous data, population pharmacokinetic analyses for subcutaneous abatacept 
in RA patients revealed that there was a trend toward higher clearance of abatacept with increasing 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
body weight. Age and gender (when corrected for body weight) did not affect apparent clearance. 
Concomitant MTX, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and TNF-inhibitors did not influence abatacept apparent 
clearance. 
Adult psoriatic arthritis 
In PsA-I, patients were randomised to receive intravenous placebo or abatacept 3 mg/kg (3/3 mg/kg), 
10 mg/kg (10/10 mg/kg), or two doses of 30 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg (30/10 mg/kg), on day 1, 
15, 29, and then every 28 days thereafter. In this study, the steady-state concentrations of abatacept 
were dose-related. The geometric mean (CV%) cmin at day 169 were 7.8 mcg/mL (56.3%) for the 
3/3 mg/kg, 24.3 mcg/mL (40.8%) for 10/10 mg/kg, and 26.6 mcg/mL (39.0%) for the 30/10 mg/kg 
regimens. 
In study PsA-II following weekly subcutaneous administration of abatacept at 125 mg, steady-state of 
abatacept was reached at day 57 with the geometric mean (CV%) cmin ranging from 22.3 (54.2%) to 
25.6 (47.7%) mcg/mL on days 57 to 169, respectively. 
Consistent with the results observed earlier in RA patients, population pharmacokinetic analyses for 
abatacept in PsA patients revealed that there was a trend toward higher clearance (L/h) of abatacept 
with increasing body weight. 
Paediatric pJIA population 
Pharmacokinetics of abatacept for subcutaneous injection have been studied in patients 2 to 17 years 
of age. 
Steady state of abatacept was achieved by day 85 following the weekly body-weight-tiered 
subcutaneous abatacept dosing. Comparable trough concentrations across weight tiers and age groups 
were achieved by the body-weight-tiered subcutaneous dosing regimen. The mean (range) trough 
concentration of abatacept at day 113 was 46.2 mcg/mL (13.4 to 96.2 mcg/mL), 48.0 mcg/mL (22.4 to 
122.1 mcg/mL), and 38.5 mcg/mL (9.3 to 73.2 mcg/mL) in paediatric pJIA patients weighing 10 to 
< 25 kg, 25 to < 50 kg, and ≥ 50 kg, respectively. 
The pharmacokinetics of abatacept is similar in adult RA and paediatric pJIA patients except for the 
higher SC absorption in pJIA patients. SC bioavailability (F) increased by 28% and the absorption rate 
constant (KA) was higher in pJIA patients than RA patients. 
Consistent with the intravenous data, population pharmacokinetic analyses for subcutaneous abatacept 
in pJIA patients revealed that there was a trend toward higher clearance of abatacept with increasing 
body weight. Age and gender (when corrected for body weight) did not affect apparent clearance. 
Concomitant medication, such as methotrexate, corticosteroids, and NSAIDs, did not influence 
abatacept apparent clearance. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No mutagenicity or clastogenicity was observed with abatacept in a battery of in vitro studies. In a 
mouse carcinogenicity study, increases in the incidence of malignant lymphomas and mammary gland 
tumours (in females) occurred. The increased incidence of lymphomas and mammary tumours 
observed in mice treated with abatacept may have been associated with decreased control of murine 
leukaemia virus and mouse mammary tumour virus, respectively, in the presence of long-term 
immunomodulation. In a one-year toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, abatacept was not 
associated with any significant toxicity. Reversible pharmacological effects consisted of minimal 
transient decreases in serum IgG and minimal to severe lymphoid depletion of germinal centres in the 
spleen and/or lymph nodes. No evidence of lymphomas or preneoplastic morphological changes was 
observed, despite the presence of a virus, lymphocryptovirus, which is known to cause such lesions in 
immunosuppressed monkeys within the time frame of this study. The relevance of these findings to the 
clinical use of abatacept is unknown. 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In rats, abatacept had no undesirable effects on male or female fertility. Embryo-foetal development 
studies were conducted with abatacept in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 20 to 30 times a 
human 10 mg/kg dose and no undesirable effects were observed in the offspring. In rats and rabbits, 
abatacept exposure was up to 29-fold a human 10 mg/kg exposure based on AUC. Abatacept was 
shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits. In a pre- and postnatal development study with 
abatacept in rats, no undesirable effects were observed in pups of dams given abatacept at doses up 
to 45 mg/kg, representing 3-fold a human 10 mg/kg exposure based on AUC. At a dose of 200 mg/kg, 
representing 11-fold a human exposure at 10 mg/kg based on AUC, limited changes in immune 
function (a 9-fold increase in the mean T-cell-dependent antibody response in female pups and 
inflammation of the thyroid of 1 female pup out of 10 male and 10 female pups evaluated at this dose) 
were observed. 
Non-clinical studies relevant for use in the paediatric population 
Studies in rats exposed to abatacept have shown immune system abnormalities including a low 
incidence of infections leading to death (juvenile rats). In addition, inflammation of the thyroid and 
pancreas was frequently seen in both juvenile and adult rats exposed to abatacept. Juvenile rats seemed 
to be more sensitive to lymphocytic inflammation of thyroid. Studies in adult mice and monkeys have 
not demonstrated similar findings. It is likely that the increased susceptibility to opportunistic 
infections observed in juvenile rats is associated with the exposure to abatacept before development of 
memory responses. The relevance of these results to humans is unknown.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
ORENCIA, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: 
 
the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who 
responded inadequately to previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX) or a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha 
inhibitor. 
the treatment of highly active and progressive disease in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
not previously treated with methotrexate. 
 
A reduction in the progression of joint damage and improvement of physical function have been 
demonstrated during combination treatment with abatacept and methotrexate. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
ORENCIA, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients when the response to previous DMARD therapy including 
MTX has been inadequate and for whom additional systemic therapy for psoriatic skin lesions is not 
required. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. 
If a response to abatacept is not present within 6 months of treatment, the continuation of the treatment 
should be reconsidered (see section 5.1). 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Posology 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Adults 
ORENCIA subcutaneous (SC) may be initiated with or without an intravenous (IV) loading dose. 
ORENCIA SC should be administered weekly at a dose of 125 mg by subcutaneous injection 
regardless of weight (see section 5.1). If a single IV infusion is given to initiate treatment (IV loading 
dose before SC administration), the first 125 mg abatacept SC should be administered within a day of 
the IV infusion, followed by the weekly 125 mg abatacept SC injections (for the posology of the 
intravenous loading dose, please refer to section 4.2 of ORENCIA 250 mg powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion). 
Patients switching from ORENCIA intravenous therapy to subcutaneous administration should 
administer the first subcutaneous dose instead of the next scheduled intravenous dose. 
No dose adjustment is required when used in combination with other DMARDs, corticosteroids, 
salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or analgesics. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Adults 
ORENCIA should be administered weekly at a dose of 125 mg by subcutaneous (SC) injection 
without the need for an intravenous (IV) loading dose. 
Patients switching from ORENCIA intravenous therapy to subcutaneous administration should 
administer the first subcutaneous dose instead of the next scheduled intravenous dose. 
Missed dose 
If a patient misses an injection of ORENCIA and is within three days of the planned date, he/she 
should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately and remain on the original weekly schedule. 
If the dose is missed by more than three days, the patient should be instructed when to take the next 
dose based on medical judgment (condition of the patient, status of disease activity, etc). 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 4.4). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
ORENCIA has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ORENCIA solution for injection in pre-filled pen for subcutaneous 
administration in children below 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available. 
ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is available for paediatric patients 6 years 
of age and older for the treatment of pJIA (see Summary of Product Characteristics for ORENCIA 
powder for concentrate for solution for infusion). 
ORENCIA solution for injection pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous administration is available for 
paediatric patients 2 years of age and older for the treatment of pJIA (see Summary of Product 
Characteristics for ORENCIA Solution for Injection pre-filled syringe). 
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous use. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ORENCIA is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional. After proper training in 
subcutaneous injection technique, a patient may self-inject with ORENCIA if a physician/healthcare 
professional determines that it is appropriate. 
The total content (1 mL) of the pre-filled pen should be administered as a subcutaneous injection only. 
Injection sites should be rotated and injections should never be given into areas where the skin is 
tender, bruised, red, or hard. 
Comprehensive instructions for the preparation and administration of ORENCIA in a pre-filled pen 
are given in the package leaflet and "Important instructions for use". For instructions on preparation of 
the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Severe and uncontrolled infections such as sepsis and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Combination with TNF-inhibitors 
There is limited experience with use of abatacept in combination with TNF-inhibitors (see 
section 5.1). In placebo-controlled clinical trials, in comparison with patients treated with 
TNF-inhibitors and placebo, patients who received combination TNF-inhibitors with abatacept 
experienced an increase in overall infections and serious infections (see section 4.5). Abatacept is not 
recommended for use in combination with TNF-inhibitors. 
While transitioning from TNF-inhibitor therapy to ORENCIA therapy, patients should be monitored 
for signs of infection (see section 5.1, study VII). 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions have been reported uncommonly with abatacept administration in clinical trials, 
where patients were not required to be pretreated to prevent allergic reactions (see section 4.8). 
Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions can occur after the first infusion and can be life-threatening. In 
post-marketing experience, a case of fatal anaphylaxis following the first infusion of ORENCIA has 
been reported. If any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, intravenous or subcutaneous 
ORENCIA therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated, and the use 
of ORENCIA should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.8). 
Effects on the immune system 
Medicinal products which affect the immune system, including ORENCIA, may affect host defences 
against infections and malignancies, and affect vaccination responses. 
Co-administration of ORENCIA with biologic immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents 
could potentiate the effects of abatacept on the immune system (see section 4.5). 
Infections 
Serious infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, have been reported with abatacept (see 
section 4.8). Some of these infections have been fatal. Many of the serious infections have occurred in 
patients on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy which in addition to their underlying disease, 
could further predispose them to infections. Treatment with ORENCIA should not be initiated in 
patients with active infections until infections are controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when 
considering the use of ORENCIA in patients with a history of recurrent infections or underlying 
conditions which may predispose them to infections. Patients who develop a new infection while 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
undergoing treatment with ORENCIA should be monitored closely. Administration of ORENCIA 
should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. 
No increase of tuberculosis was observed in the pivotal placebo-controlled studies; however, all 
ORENCIA patients were screened for tuberculosis. The safety of ORENCIA in individuals with latent 
tuberculosis is unknown. There have been reports of tuberculosis in patients receiving ORENCIA (see 
section 4.8). Patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis prior to initiating ORENCIA. The 
available medical guidelines should also be taken into account. 
Anti-rheumatic therapies have been associated with hepatitis B reactivation. Therefore, screening for 
viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with published guidelines before starting therapy 
with ORENCIA. 
Treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, such as ORENCIA, may be associated with progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If neurological symptoms suggestive of PML occur during 
ORENCIA therapy, treatment with ORENCIA should be discontinued and appropriate diagnostic 
measures initiated. 
Malignancies 
In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the frequencies of malignancies in abatacept- and placebo-
treated patients were 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively (see section 4.8). Patients with known malignancies 
were not included in these clinical trials. In carcinogenicity studies in mice, an increase in lymphomas 
and mammary tumours were noted. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown (see 
section 5.3). The potential role of abatacept in the development of malignancies, including lymphoma, 
in humans is unknown. There have been reports of non-melanoma skin cancers in patients receiving 
ORENCIA (see section 4.8). Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly 
those with risk factors for skin cancer. 
Vaccinations 
Patients treated with ORENCIA may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Live 
vaccines should not be given concurrently with abatacept or within 3 months of its discontinuation. 
Medicinal products that affect the immune system, including abatacept, may blunt the effectiveness of 
some immunisations (see section 4.5). 
Elderly patients 
A total of 404 patients 65 years of age and older, including 67 patients 75 years and older, received 
intravenous abatacept in placebo-controlled clinical trials. A total of 270 patients 65 years of age and 
older, including 46 patients 75 years and older, received subcutaneous abatacept in controlled clinical 
trials. The frequencies of serious infection and malignancy relative to placebo among intravenous 
abatacept-treated patients over age 65 were higher than among those under age 65. Similarly, the 
frequencies of serious infection and malignancy among subcutaneous abatacept-treated patients over 
age 65 were higher than among those under age 65. Because there is a higher incidence of infections 
and malignancies in the elderly in general, caution should be used when treating the elderly (see 
section 4.8). 
Autoimmune processes 
There is a theoretical concern that treatment with abatacept might increase the risk for autoimmune 
processes in adults, for example deterioration of multiple sclerosis. In the placebo-controlled clinical 
trials, abatacept treatment did not lead to increased autoantibody formation, such as antinuclear and 
anti-dsDNA antibodies, relative to placebo treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.3). 
Patients on controlled sodium diet 
This medicinal product contains 0.014 mmol sodium (0.322 mg) per pre-filled pen, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium- free’. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Combination with TNF-inhibitors 
There is limited experience with the use of abatacept in combination with TNF-inhibitors (see 
section 5.1). While TNF-inhibitors did not influence abatacept clearance, in placebo-controlled clinical 
trials, patients receiving concomitant treatment with abatacept and TNF-inhibitors experienced more 
infections and serious infections than patients treated with only TNF-inhibitors. Therefore, concurrent 
therapy with abatacept and a TNF-inhibitor is not recommended. 
Combination with other medicinal products 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of methotrexate, NSAIDs, and 
corticosteroids on abatacept clearance (see section 5.2). 
No major safety issues were identified with use of abatacept in combination with sulfasalazine, 
hydroxychloroquine, or leflunomide. 
Combination with other medicinal products that affect the immune system and with vaccinations 
Co-administration of abatacept with biologic immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents could 
potentiate the effects of abatacept on the immune system. There is insufficient evidence to assess the 
safety and efficacy of abatacept in combination with anakinra or rituximab (see section 4.4). 
Vaccinations 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with abatacept or within 3 months of its 
discontinuation. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons 
receiving live vaccines to patients receiving abatacept. Medicinal products that affect the immune 
system, including abatacept, may blunt the effectiveness of some immunisations (see sections 4.4 and 
4.6). 
Exploratory studies to assess the effect of abatacept on the antibody response to vaccination in healthy 
subjects as well as the antibody response to influenza and pneumococcal vaccines in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients suggested that abatacept may blunt the effectiveness of the immune response, but did 
not significantly inhibit the ability to develop a clinically significant or positive immune response. 
Abatacept was evaluated in an open-label study in rheumatoid arthritis patients administered the 
23-valent pneumococcal vaccine. After pneumococcal vaccination, 62 of 112 abatacept-treated 
patients were able to mount an adequate immune response of at least a 2-fold increase in antibody 
titers to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. 
Abatacept was also evaluated in an open-label study in rheumatoid arthritis patients administered the 
seasonal influenza trivalent virus vaccine. After influenza vaccination, 73 of 119 abatacept-treated 
patients without protective antibody levels at baseline were able to mount an adequate immune 
response of at least a 4-fold increase in antibody titers to trivalent influenza vaccine.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy and women of childbearing potential 
There are no adequate data from use of abatacept in pregnant women. In pre-clinical embryo-foetal 
development studies no undesirable effects were observed at doses up to 29-fold a human 10 mg/kg 
dose based on AUC. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, limited changes in immune 
function were observed at 11-fold higher than a human 10 mg/kg dose based on AUC (see 
section 5.3). 
ORENCIA should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with abatacept. 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and up 
to 14 weeks after the last dose of abatacept. 
Abatacept may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with abatacept 
during pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk of infection. The safety of 
administering live vaccines to infants exposed to abatacept in utero is unknown. Administration of live 
vaccines to infants exposed to abatacept in utero is not recommended for 14 weeks following the 
mother’s last exposure to abatacept during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Abatacept has been shown to be present in rat milk. 
It is unknown whether abatacept is excreted in human milk. 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with ORENCIA and for up to 14 weeks after 
the last dose of abatacept treatment. 
Fertility 
Formal studies of the potential effect of abatacept on human fertility have not been conducted. 
In rats, abatacept had no undesirable effects on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Based on its mechanism of action, abatacept is expected to have no or negligible influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines. However, dizziness and reduced visual acuity have been reported as 
common and uncommon adverse reactions respectively from patients treated with ORENCIA, 
therefore if a patient experiences such symptoms, driving and use of machinery should be avoided. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis 
Abatacept has been studied in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in placebo-controlled clinical 
trials (2,653 patients with abatacept, 1,485 with placebo). 
In placebo-controlled clinical trials with abatacept, adverse reactions (ARs) were reported in 49.4% of 
abatacept-treated patients and 45.8% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse 
reactions (≥ 5%) among abatacept-treated patients were headache, nausea, and upper respiratory tract 
infections (including sinusitis). The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to ARs 
was 3.0% for abatacept-treated patients and 2.0% for placebo-treated patients.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
In the placebo-controlled clinical trials with abatacept, infections at least possibly related to treatment 
were reported in 22.7% of abatacept-treated patients and 20.5% of placebo-treated patients. 
Serious infections at least possibly related to treatment were reported in 1.5% of abatacept-treated 
patients and 1.1% of placebo-treated patients. The type of serious infections was similar between the 
abatacept and placebo treatment groups (see section 4.4). 
The incidence rates (95% CI) for serious infections was 3.0 (2.3, 3.8) per 100 patient-years for 
abatacept-treated patients and 2.3 (1.5, 3.3) per 100 patient-years for placebo-treated patients in the 
double-blind studies. 
In the cumulative period in clinical trials in 7,044 patients treated with abatacept during 
20,510 patient-years, the incidence rate of serious infections was 2.4 per 100 patient-years, and the 
annualised incidence rate remained stable.

Malignancies 
In placebo-controlled clinical trials, malignancies were reported in 1.2% (31/2,653) of abatacept-
treated patients and in 0.9% (14/1,485) of placebo-treated patients. The incidence rates for 
malignancies was 1.3 (0.9, 1.9) per 100 patient-years for abatacept-treated patients and 1.1 (0.6, 1.9) 
per 100 patient-years for placebo-treated patients. 
In the cumulative period 7,044 patients treated with abatacept during 21,011 patient-years (of which 
over 1,000 were treated with abatacept for over 5 years), the incidence rate of malignancy was 
1.2 (1.1, 1.4) per 100 patient-years, and the annualised incidence rates remained stable. 
The most frequently reported malignancy in the placebo-controlled clinical trials was non-melanoma 
skin cancer; 0.6 (0.3, 1.0) per 100 patient-years for abatacept-treated patients and 0.4 (0.1, 0.9) per 
100 patient-years for placebo-treated patients and 0.5 (0.4, 0.6) per 100 patient-years in the cumulative 
period. 
The most frequently reported organ cancer in the placebo-controlled clinical trials was lung cancer 
0.17 (0.05, 0.43) per 100 patient-years for abatacept-treated patients, 0 for placebo-treated patients, 
and 0.12 (0.08, 0.17) per 100 patient-years in the cumulative period. The most common hematologic 
malignancy was lymphoma 0.04 (0, 0.24) per 100 patient-years for abatacept-treated patients, 0 for 
placebo-treated patients, and 0.06 (0.03, 0.1) per 100 patient-years in the cumulative period. 
Adverse reactions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
In study IV, there were 37 patients with COPD treated with intravenous abatacept and 17 treated with 
placebo. The COPD patients treated with abatacept developed adverse reactions more frequently than 
those treated with placebo (51.4% vs. 47.1%, respectively). Respiratory disorders occurred more 
frequently in abatacept-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (10.8% vs. 5.9%, respectively); 
these included COPD exacerbation, and dyspnoea. A greater percentage of abatacept- than 
placebo-treated patients with COPD developed a serious adverse reaction (5.4% vs. 0%), including 
COPD exacerbation (1 of 37 patients [2.7%]) and bronchitis (1 of 37 patients [2.7%]). 
Autoimmune processes 
Abatacept therapy did not lead to increased formation of autoantibodies, i.e., antinuclear and anti-
dsDNA antibodies, compared with placebo. 
The incidence rate of autoimmune disorders in abatacept-treated patients during the double-blind 
period was 8.8 (7.6, 10.1) per 100 person-years of exposure and for placebo-treated patients was 
9.6 (7.9, 11.5) per 100 person-years of exposure. The incidence rate in abatacept-treated patients was 
3.8 per 100 person-years in the cumulative period. The most frequently reported autoimmune-related 
disorders other than the indication being studied during the cumulative period were psoriasis, 
rheumatoid nodule, and Sjogren's syndrome. 
Immunogenicity in adults treated with intravenous abatacept 
Antibodies directed against the abatacept molecule were assessed by ELISA assays in 
3,985 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated for up to 8 years with abatacept. One hundred and 
eighty-seven of 3,877 (4.8%) patients developed anti-abatacept antibodies while on treatment. In 
patients assessed for anti-abatacept antibodies after discontinuation of abatacept (> 42 days after last 
dose), 103 of 1,888 (5.5%) were seropositive. 
Samples with confirmed binding activity to CTLA-4 were assessed for the presence of neutralizing 
antibodies. Twenty-two of 48 evaluable patients showed significant neutralizing activity. The potential 
clinical relevance of neutralizing antibody formation is not known. 
Overall, there was no apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse 
events. However, the number of patients that developed antibodies was too limited to make a 
definitive assessment. Because immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody 
rates with those from other products is not appropriate. 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity in adults treated with subcutaneous abatacept 
Study SC-I compared the immunogenicity to abatacept following subcutaneous or intravenous 
administration as assessed by ELISA assay. During the initial double blind 6 months period 
(short-term period), the overall immunogenicity frequency to abatacept was 1.1% (8/725) and 
2.3% (16/710) for the subcutaneous and intravenous groups, respectively. The rate is consistent with 
previous experience, and there was no effect of immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics, safety, or 
efficacy. 
Immunogenicity to abatacept following long-term subcutaneous administration was assessed by a new 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay. Comparison of incidence rates across different assays is not 
appropriate, as the ECL assay was developed to be more sensitive and drug tolerant than the previous 
ELISA assay. The cumulative immunogenicity frequency to abatacept by the ECL assay with at least 
one positive sample in the short-term and long-term periods combined was 15.7% (215/1369) while on 
abatacept, with a mean duration of exposure of 48.8 months, and 17.3% (194/1121) after 
discontinuation (> 21 days up to 168 days after last dose). The exposure adjusted incidence rate 
(expressed per 100 person-years) remained stable over the treatment duration. 
Consistent with previous experience, titers and persistence of antibody responses were generally low 
and did not increase upon continued dosing (6.8% subjects were seropositive on 2 consecutive visits), 
and there was no apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response, adverse events, or 
pharmacokinetics. 
In study SC-III, similar immunogenicity rates were seen in patients on treatment for the 
abatacept+MTX, and abatacept monotherapy groups (2.9% (3/103) and 5.0% (5/101), respectively) 
during the double-blind 12-month period. As in study SC-I, there was no effect of immunogenicity on 
safety or efficacy. 
Immunogenicity and safety of abatacept upon withdrawal and restart of treatment 
A study in the subcutaneous program was conducted to investigate the effect of withdrawal (three 
months) and restart of abatacept subcutaneous treatment on immunogenicity. Upon withdrawal of 
abatacept subcutaneous treatment, the increased rate of immunogenicity was consistent with that seen 
upon discontinuation of abatacept administered intravenously. Upon reinitiating therapy, there were no 
injection reactions and no other safety concerns in patients who were withdrawn from subcutaneous 
therapy for up to 3 months relative to those who remained on subcutaneous therapy, whether therapy 
was reintroduced with or without an intravenous loading dose. The safety observed in the treatment 
arm that reinitiated therapy without an intravenous loading dose was also consistent with that observed 
in the other studies. 
In SC-III, increased rates of immunogenicity were observed in subjects tested during 6 months of 
complete drug withdrawal in the abatacept+MTX and abatacept monotherapy groups (37.7% [29/77] 
and 44.1% [27/59], respectively) with generally low titer antibody responses. No clinical impact of 
these antibody responses was detected, and no safety concerns were observed upon reinitiation of 
abatacept therapy. 
Injection Reactions in adult patients treated with subcutaneous abatacept 
Study SC-I compared the safety of abatacept including injection site reactions following subcutaneous 
or intravenous administration. The overall frequency of injection site reactions was 2.6% (19/736) and 
2.5% (18/721) for the subcutaneous abatacept group and the subcutaneous placebo group (intravenous 
abatacept), respectively. All injection site reactions were described as mild to moderate (hematoma, 
pruritus, or erythema) and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. During the cumulative 
study period when all subjects treated with abatacept in 7 SC studies were included the frequency of 
injection site reactions was 4.6% (116/2,538) with an incidence rate of 1.32 per 100 person-years. 
Postmarketing reports of systemic injection reactions (e.g. pruritus, throat tightness, dyspnoea) have 
been received following the use of subcutaneous ORENCIA.

Safety information related to the pharmacological class 
Abatacept is the first selective co-stimulation modulator. Information on the relative safety in a 
clinical trial versus infliximab is summarized in section 5.1. 
Summary of the safety profile in psoriatic arthritis 
Abatacept has been studied in patients with active psoriatic arthritis in two placebo-controlled clinical 
trials (341 patients with abatacept, 253 patients with placebo) (see Section 5.1). During the 24-week 
placebo-controlled period in the larger study PsA-II, the proportion of patients with adverse reactions 
was similar in the abatacept and placebo treatment groups (15.5% and 11.4%, respectively). There 
were no adverse reactions that occurred at ≥ 2% in either treatment group during the 24-week 
placebo-controlled period. The overall safety profile was comparable between studies PsA-I and 
PsA-II and consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis (Table 1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 50 mg/kg have been administered intravenously without apparent toxic effect. In case of 
overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse 
reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: 
L04AA24 
Abatacept is a fusion protein that consists of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic 
T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) linked to a modified Fc portion of human 
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Abatacept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese 
hamster ovary cells. 
Mechanism of action 
Abatacept selectively modulates a key costimulatory signal required for full activation of T 
lymphocytes expressing CD28. Full activation of T lymphocytes requires two signals provided by 
antigen presenting cells: recognition of a specific antigen by a T cell receptor (signal 1) and a second, 
costimulatory signal. A major costimulatory pathway involves the binding of CD80 and 
CD86 molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells to the CD28 receptor on T lymphocytes 
(signal 2). Abatacept selectively inhibits this costimulatory pathway by specifically binding to 
CD80 and CD86. Studies indicate that naive T lymphocyte responses are more affected by abatacept 
than memory T lymphocyte responses. 
Studies in vitro and in animal models demonstrate that abatacept modulates T lymphocyte-dependent 
antibody responses and inflammation. In vitro, abatacept attenuates human T lymphocyte activation as 
measured by decreased proliferation and cytokine production. Abatacept decreases antigen specific 
TNFα, interferon-γ, and interleukin-2 production by T lymphocytes. 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Dose-dependent reductions were observed with abatacept in serum levels of soluble 
interleukin-2 receptor, a marker of T lymphocyte activation; serum interleukin-6, a product of 
activated synovial macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatoid 
factor, an autoantibody produced by plasma cells; and C-reactive protein, an acute phase reactant of 
inflammation. In addition, serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3, which produces cartilage 
destruction and tissue remodelling, were decreased. Reductions in serum TNFα were also observed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in adult rheumatoid arthritis 
The efficacy and safety of intravenous abatacept were assessed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trials in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to 
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Studies I, II, III, V, and VI required patients to 
have at least 12 tender and 10 swollen joints at randomisation. Study IV did not require any specific 
number of tender or swollen joints. Study SC-I was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy non-
inferiority study administered to patients stratified by body weight (< 60 kg, 60 to 100 kg, > 100 kg) 
that compared the efficacy and safety of abatacept administered subcutaneously and intravenously in 
subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), receiving background methotrexate (MTX), and experiencing 
an inadequate response to MTX (MTX-IR). 
In studies I, II, and V the efficacy and safety of abatacept compared to placebo were assessed in 
patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate and who continued on their stable dose of 
methotrexate. In addition, study V investigated the safety and efficacy of abatacept or infliximab 
relative to placebo. In study III the efficacy and safety of abatacept were assessed in patients with an 
inadequate response to a TNF-inhibitor, with the TNF-inhibitor discontinued prior to randomisation; 
other DMARDs were permitted. Study IV primarily assessed safety in patients with active rheumatoid 
arthritis requiring additional intervention in spite of current therapy with non-biological and/or 
biological DMARDs; all DMARDs used at enrollment were continued. In study VI, the efficacy and 
safety of abatacept were assessed in methotrexate-naive, Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and/or anti-Cyclic 
Citrullinated Peptide 2 (Anti-CCP2)-positive patients with early, erosive rheumatoid arthritis 
(≤ 2 years disease duration) who were randomised to receive abatacept plus methotrexate or 
methotrexate plus placebo. In study SC-I, the goal was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the efficacy 
and comparability of the safety of abatacept subcutaneous relative to intravenous administration in 
subjects with moderate to severely active RA and experiencing inadequate response to MTX. Study 
SC-II investigated the relative efficacy and safety of abatacept and adalimumab, both given 
subcutaneously without an intravenous loading dose and with background MTX, in patients with 
moderate to severely active RA and an inadequate response to previous MTX therapy. In study SC-III, 
abatacept subcutaneous was evaluated in combination with methotrexate, or as abatacept 
monotherapy, and compared to MTX monotherapy in induction of remission following 12 months of 
treatment, and the possible maintenance of drug-free remission after complete drug withdrawal, in 
adult MTX-naive patients with highly active early rheumatoid arthritis (mean DAS28-CRP of 5.4; 
mean symptom duration less than 6.7 months) with poor prognostic factors for rapidly progressive 
disease (e.g. anti-citrullinated protein antibodies [ACPA+], as measured by anti-CCP2 assay, and/or 
RF+, baseline joint erosions). 
Study I patients were randomised to receive abatacept 2 or 10 mg/kg or placebo for 12 months. 
Study II, III, IV, and VI patients were randomised to receive a fixed dose approximating 10 mg/kg of 
abatacept or placebo for 12 (studies II, IV, and VI) or 6 months (study III). The dose of abatacept 
was 500 mg for patients weighing less than 60 kg, 750 mg for patients weighing 60 to 100 kg, and 
1,000 mg for patients weighing greater than 100 kg. In study SC-I, abatacept was given 
subcutaneously to patients after a single loading dose of intravenous abatacept and then every week 
thereafter. Subjects continued taking their current dose of MTX from the day of randomisation. 
Study V patients were randomised to receive this same fixed dose of abatacept or 3 mg/kg infliximab 
or placebo for 6 months. Study V continued for an additional 6 months with the abatacept and 
infliximab groups only. 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Studies I, II, III, IV, V, VI, SC-I, SC-II, and SC-III evaluated 339, 638, 389, 1441, 431, 509, 1371, 
646, and 351 adult patients, respectively. 
Clinical response 
ACR response 
The percent of abatacept-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50, and 70 responses in study II (patients 
with inadequate response to methotrexate), study III (patients with inadequate response to TNF-
inhibitor), study VI (methotrexate-naive patients), and study SC-I (subcutaneous abatacept) are shown 
in Table 2. 
In abatacept-treated patients in studies II and III, statistically significant improvement in the 
ACR 20 response versus placebo was observed after administration of the first dose (day 15), and this 
improvement remained significant for the duration of the studies. In study VI, statistically significant 
improvement in the ACR 20 response in abatacept plus methotrexate-treated patients versus 
methotrexate plus placebo-treated patients was observed at 29 days, and was maintained through the 
duration of the study. In study II, 43% of the patients who had not achieved an ACR 20 response 
at 6 months developed an ACR 20 response at 12 months. 
In study SC-I, abatacept administered subcutaneously (SC) was non-inferior relative to intravenous 
(IV) infusions of abatacept with respect to ACR 20 responses up to 6 months of treatment. Patients 
treated with abatacept subcutaneously also achieved similar ACR 50 and 70 responses as those 
patients receiving abatacept intravenously at 6 months. 
No difference in clinical response between subcutaneous and intravenous abatacept was seen across 
the 3 weight groups. In SC-I, the ACR 20 response rates at day 169 for subcutaneous and intravenous 
abatacept were respectively 78.3% (472/603 SC) and 76.0% (456/600 IV) in patients < 65 years, 
versus 61.1% (55/90 SC) and 74.4% (58/78 IV) for patients ≥ 65 years.

In the open-label extension of studies I, II, III, VI, and SC-I durable and sustained ACR 20, 50, 
and 70 responses have been observed through 7 years, 5 years, 5 years, 2 years, and 5 years, 
respectively, of abatacept treatment. In study I, ACR responses were assessed at 7 years in 43 patients 
with 72% ACR 20 responses, 58% ACR 50 responses, and 44% ACR 70 responses. In study II, ACR 
responses were assessed at 5 years in 270 patients with 84% ACR 20 responses, 61% ACR 50 
responses, and 40% ACR 70 responses. In study III, ACR responses were assessed at 5 years in 
91 patients with 74% ACR 20 responses, 51% ACR 50 responses, and 23% ACR 70 responses. In 
study VI, ACR responses were assessed at 2 years in 232 patients with 85% ACR 20 responses, 
74% ACR 50 responses, and 54% ACR 70 responses. In study SC-I, ACR responses were assessed at 
5 years with 85% (356/421) ACR 20 responses, 66% (277/423) ACR 50 responses, and 
45% (191/425) ACR 70 responses. 
Greater improvements were seen with abatacept than with placebo in other measures of rheumatoid 
arthritis disease activity not included in the ACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. 
DAS28 response 
Disease activity was also assessed using the Disease Activity Score 28. There was a significant 
improvement of DAS in studies II, III, V, and VI as compared to placebo or comparator.

In study VI, which only included adults, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the abatacept 
plus methotrexate group (41%) achieved DAS28 (CRP)-defined remission (score < 2.6) versus the 
methotrexate plus placebo group (23%) at year 1. The response at year 1 in the abatacept group was 
maintained through year 2. 
Study V: abatacept or infliximab versus placebo 
A randomised, double-blind study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous 
abatacept or infliximab versus placebo in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate 
(study V). The primary outcome was the mean change in disease activity in abatacept-treated patients 
compared to placebo-treated patients at 6 months with a subsequent double-blind assessment of safety 
and efficacy of abatacept and infliximab at 12 months. Greater improvement (p < 0.001) in 
DAS28 was observed with abatacept and with infliximab compared to placebo at six months in the 
placebo-controlled portion of the trial; the results between the abatacept and infliximab groups were 
similar. The ACR responses in study V were consistent with the DAS28 score. Further improvement 
was observed at 12 months with abatacept. At 6 months, the incidence of AE of infections were 
48.1% (75), 52.1% (86), and 51.8% (57) and the incidence of serious AE of infections were 1.3% (2), 
4.2% (7), and 2.7% (3) for abatacept, infliximab and placebo groups, respectively. At 12 months, the 
incidence of AE of infections were 59.6% (93), 68.5% (113), and the incidence of serious AE of 
infections were 1.9% (3) and 8.5% (14) for abatacept and infliximab groups, respectively. The open 
label period of the study provided an assessment of the ability of abatacept to maintain efficacy for 
subjects originally randomised to abatacept and the efficacy response of those subjects who were 
switched to abatacept following treatment with infliximab. The reduction from baseline in mean 
DAS28 score at day 365 (-3.06) was maintained through day 729 (-3.34) in those patients who 
continued with abatacept. In those patients who initially received infliximab and then switched to 
abatacept, the reduction in the mean DAS28 score from baseline were 3.29 at day 729 and 2.48 at 
day 365. 
Study SC-II: abatacept versus adalimumab 
A randomised, single (investigator)-blinded, non-inferiority study was conducted to assess the safety 
and efficacy of weekly subcutaneous (SC) abatacept without an abatacept intravenous (IV) loading 
dose versus every-other-weekly subcutaneous adalimumab, both with background MTX, in patients 
with an inadequate response to methotrexate (study SC-II). The primary endpoint showed 
non-inferiority (predefined margin of 12%) of ACR20 response after 12 months of treatment, 
64.8% (206/318) for the abatacept SC group and 63.4% (208/328) for the adalimumab SC group; 
treatment difference was 1.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): -5.6, 9.2], with comparable responses 
throughout the 24-month period. The respective values for ACR 20 at 24 months were 
59.7% (190/318) for the abatacept SC group and 60.1% (197/328) for the adalimumab SC group. The 
respective values for ACR 50 and ACR 70 at 12 months and 24 months were consistent and similar for 
abatacept and adalimumab. The adjusted mean changes (standard error; SE) from baseline in 
DAS28-CRP were -2.35 (SE 0.08) [95% CI: -2.51, -2.19] and -2.33 (SE 0.08) [95% CI: -2.50, -2.17] 
in the SC abatacept group and the adalimumab group, respectively, at 24 months, with similar changes 
over time. At 24 months, 50.6% (127/251) [95% CI: 44.4, 56.8] of patients in abatacept and 
53.3% (130/244) [95% CI: 47.0, 59.5] of patients in adalimumab groups achieved DAS 28 < 2.6. 
Improvement from baseline as measured by HAQ-DI at 24 months and over time was also similar 
between abatacept SC and adalimumab SC. 
Safety and structural damage assessments were conducted at one and two years. The overall safety 
profile with respect to adverse reactions was similar between the two groups over the 24-month 
period. After 24-months, adverse reactions were reported in 41.5% (132/318) and 50% (164/328) of 
abatacept and adalimumab-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 3.5% (11/318) 
and 6.1% (20/328) of the respective group. At 24-months, 20.8% (66/318) of patients on abatacept and 
25.3% (83/328) on adalimumab had discontinued. 
In SC-II, serious infections were reported in 3.8% (12/318) of patients treated with abatacept SC 
weekly, none of which led to discontinuation and in 5.8% (19/328) of patients treated with 
adalimumab SC every-other-week, leading to 9 discontinuations in the 24-month period. 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
The frequency of local injection site reactions was 3.8% (12/318) and 9.1% (30/328) at 12 months 
(p = 0.006) and 4.1% (13/318) and 10.4% (34/328) at 24 months for abatacept SC and adalimumab 
SC, respectively. Over the 2 year study period, 3.8% (12/318) and 1.5% (5/328) patients treated with 
abatacept SC and adalimumab SC respectively reported autoimmune disorders mild to moderate in 
severity (e.g., psoriasis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, erythema nodosum). 
Study SC-III: Induction of remission in methotrexate-naive RA patients 
A randomised and double-blinded study evaluated abatacept SC in combination with methotrexate 
(abatacept + MTX), abatacept SC monotherapy, or methotrexate monotherapy (MTX group) in 
induction of remission following 12 months of treatment, and maintenance of drug-free remission after 
complete drug withdrawal in MTX-naive adult patients with highly active early rheumatoid arthritis 
with poor prognostic factors. Complete drug withdrawal led to loss of remission (return to disease 
activity) in all three treatment arms (abatacept with methotrexate, abatacept or methotrexate alone) in a 
majority of patients (Table 3).

In SC-III the safety profiles of the three treatment groups (abatacept + MTX, abatacept monotherapy, 
MTX group) were overall similar. During the 12-month treatment period, adverse reactions were 
reported in 44.5% (53/119), 41.4% (48/116), and 44.0% (51/116) and serious adverse reactions were 
reported in 2.5% (3/119), 2.6% (3/116) and 0.9% (1/116) of patients treated in the three treatment 
groups, respectively. Serious infections were reported in 0.8% (1/119), 3.4% (4/116) and 0% (0/116) 
patients. 
Radiographic response 
Structural joint damage was assessed radiographically over a two-year period in studies II, VI, and 
SC-II. The results were measured using the Genant-modified total Sharp score (TSS) and its 
components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing (JSN) score. 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study II, the baseline median TSS was 31.7 in abatacept-treated patients and 33.4 in placebo-treated 
patients. Abatacept/methotrexate reduced the rate of progression of structural damage compared to 
placebo/methotrexate after 12 months of treatment as shown in Table 4. The rate of progression of 
structural damage in year 2 was significantly lower than that in year 1 for patients randomised to 
abatacept (p < 0.0001). Subjects entering the long term extension after 1 year of double blind 
treatment all received abatacept treatment and radiographic progression was investigated through 
year 5. Data were analysed in an as-observed analysis using mean change in total score from the 
previous annual visit. The mean change was, 0.41 and 0.74 from year 1 to year 2 (n = 290, 130), 0.37 
and 0.68 from year 2 to year 3 (n = 293, 130), 0.34 and 0.43 from year 3 to year 4 (n = 290, 128) and 
the change was 0.26 and 0.29 (n = 233, 114) from year 4 to year 5 for patients originally randomised 
to abatacept plus MTX and placebo plus MTX respectively.

a Based on non-parametric analysis. 
In study VI, the mean change in TSS at 12 months was significantly lower in patients treated with 
abatacept plus methotrexate compared to those treated with methotrexate plus placebo. At 12 months 
61% (148/242) of the patients treated with abatacept plus methotrexate and 53% (128/242) of the 
patients treated with methotrexate plus placebo had no progression (TSS ≤ 0). The progression of 
structural damage was lower in patients receiving continuous abatacept plus methotrexate treatment 
(for 24 months) compared to patients who initially received methotrexate plus placebo (for 12 months) 
and were switched to abatacept plus methotrexate for the next 12 months. Among the patients who 
entered the open-label 12-month period, 59% (125/213) of patients receiving continuous abatacept 
plus methotrexate treatment and 48% (92/192) of patients who initially received methotrexate and 
switched to combination with abatacept had no progression. 
In study SC-II, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as a change from 
baseline in the van der Heijde-modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components. Similar 
inhibition was observed in both treatment groups up to 24 months (mTSS (mean ± standard deviation 
[SD] = 0.89 ±4.13 vs 1.13 ±8.66), erosion score (0.41 ±2.57 vs 0.41 ±5.04), and JSN score (0.48 ±2.18 
vs 0.72 ±3.81)) for the abatacept (n = 257) and adalimumab (n = 260) groups, respectively. 
In study SC-III, structural joint damage was assessed by MRI. The abatacept + MTX group had less 
progression in structural damage compared with MTX group as reflected by mean treatment difference 
of the abatacept + MTX group versus MTX group (Table 5).

Physical function response 
Improvement in physical function was measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability 
Index (HAQ-DI) in studies II, III, IV, V, and VI and the modified HAQ-DI in study I. In study SC-I, 
improvement from baseline as measured by HAQ-DI at 6 months and over time was similar between 
subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The results from studies II, III, and VI are shown in 
Table 6.

Health-related outcomes and quality of life 
Health-related quality of life was assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire at 6 months in studies I, II, and 
III and at 12 months in studies I and II. In these studies, clinically and statistically significant 
improvement was observed in the abatacept group as compared with the placebo group in 
all 8 domains of the SF-36 (4 physical domains: physical function, role physical, bodily pain, general 
health; and 4 mental domains: vitality, social function, role emotional, mental health), as well as the 
Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In study VI, 
improvement was observed at 12 months in abatacept plus methotrexate group as compared with the 
methotrexate plus placebo group in both PCS and MCS, and was maintained through 2 years. 
Study VII: Safety of abatacept in patients with or without washout of previous TNF-inhibitor therapy 
A study of open-label intravenous abatacept on a background of nonbiologic DMARDs was conducted 
in patients with active RA who had an inadequate response to previous (washout for at least 2 months; 
n = 449) or current (no washout period; n = 597) TNF-inhibitor therapy (study VII). The primary 
outcome, incidence of AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs during 6 months of treatment, was 
similar between those who were previous and current TNF-inhibitor users at enrollment, as was the 
frequency of serious infections. 
Study SC-I: Pre-filled pen sub-study 
Patients in the sub-study (n = 117) of the open-label extension of study SC-I received 125 mg of 
subcutaneous abatacept administered weekly via the pre-filled syringe for at least 4 months, and were 
then switched to receive 125 mg SC abatacept administered weekly via the pre-filled pen for 
12 weeks. The adjusted geometric mean of abatacept at steady state trough concentration (Cminss) 
was 25.3 mcg/mL for the subcutaneous pre-filled pen and 27.8 mcg/mL for the subcutaneous pre-filled 
syringe with a ratio of 0.91 [90% CI: 0.83, 1.00]. During the 12-week pre-filled pen period of the 
sub-study, there were no deaths or related SAEs. Three patients had SAEs (postoperative wound 
infection, H1N1 influenza, and myocardial ischemia in 1 patient each) that were not considered related 
to the study drug. There were six overall discontinuations during this period, only one of which was 
due to an AE (the SAE of post-operative wound infection). Two patients (2/117, 1.7%) using the SC 
pre-filled pen experienced local injection site reactions. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in adult psoriatic arthritis 
The efficacy and safety of abatacept were assessed in two randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trials (studies PsA-I and PsA-II) in adult patients, age 18 years and older. Patients 
had active PsA (≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) despite prior treatment with DMARD therapy 
and had one qualifying psoriatic skin lesion of at least 2 cm in diameter. 
In study PsA-I, 170 patients received placebo or abatacept intravenously on Day 1, 15, 29, and then 
every 28 days thereafter in a double blind manner for 24 weeks, followed by open-label abatacept 
10 mg/kg intravenous every 28 days. Patients were randomised to receive placebo or abatacept 
3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or two doses of 30 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg, without escape for 24 weeks, 
followed by open label abatacept 10 mg/kg monthly intravenous every month. Patients were allowed 
to receive stable doses of concomitant methotrexate, low dose corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg 
of prednisone) and/or NSAIDs during the trial. 
In study PsA-II, 424 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive in a double-blind manner weekly doses 
of subcutaneous placebo or abatacept 125 mg without a loading dose for 24 weeks, followed by 
open-label abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous weekly. Patients were allowed to receive stable doses of 
concomitant methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, low dose corticosteroids 
(equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone) and/or NSAIDs during the trial. Patients who had not achieved 
at least a 20% improvement from baseline in their swollen and tender joint counts by Week 16 
escaped to open-label abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous weekly.

A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved an ACR 20 response after treatment with 
abatacept 10 mg/kg intravenous in PsA-I or 125 mg subcutaneous in PsA-II compared to placebo at 
Week 24 in the overall study populations. Higher ACR 20 responses were observed with abatacept vs 
placebo regardless of prior TNF-inhibitor treatment in both studies. In the smaller study PsA-I, the 
ACR 20 responses with abatacept 10 mg/kg intravenous vs placebo in patients who were TNF 
inhibitor-naive were 55.6% vs 20.0%, respectively, and in patients who were TNF 
inhibitor-experienced were 30.8% vs 16.7%, respectively. In study PsA-II, the ACR 20 responses with 
abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous vs placebo in patients who were TNF inhibitor-naive were 44.0% vs 
22.2%, respectively (21.9 [8.3, 35.6], estimate of difference [95% CI]), and in patients who were TNF 
inhibitor-experienced were 36.4% vs 22.3%, respectively (14.0 [3.3, 24.8], estimate of difference 
[95% CI]). 
Higher ACR 20 responses in study PsA-II were seen with abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous vs. placebo 
irrespective of concomitant non-biological DMARD treatment. The ACR 20 responses with abatacept 
125 mg subcutaneous vs placebo in patients who did not use non-biological DMARDs were 27.3% vs 
12.1%, respectively, (15.15 [1.83, 28.47] estimate of difference [95% CI]), and in patients who had 
used non-biological DMARDs were 44.9% vs 26.9%, respectively, (18.00 [7.20, 28.81], estimate of 
difference [95% CI]). Clinical responses were maintained or continued to improve up to one year in 
studies PsA-I and PsA-II. 
Structural response 
In study PsA-II, the proportion of radiographic non-progressors (≤ 0 change from baseline) in total 
PsA-modified SHS on x-rays at Week 24 was greater with abatacept 125 mg subcutaneous (42.7%) 
than placebo (32.7%) (10.0 [1.0, 19.1] estimate of difference [95% CI]).

Physical Function Response 
In study PsA-I, the proportion of patients with ≥ 0.30 decrease from baseline in HAQ-DI score was 
45.0% with intravenous abatacept vs 19.0% with placebo (26.1 [6.8, 45.5], estimate of difference 
[95% CI]) at Week 24. In study PsA-II, the proportion of patients with at least ≥ 0.35 decrease from 
baseline in HAQ-DI was 31.0% with abatacept vs. 23.7% with placebo (7.2 [-1.1, 15.6], estimate of 
difference [95% CI]). Improvement in HAQ-DI scores was maintained or improved for up to 1 year 
with continuing abatacept treatment in both PsA-I and PsA-II studies. 
No significant changes in PASI scores with abatacept treatment were seen over the 24-week 
double-blind period. Patients entering the two PsA studies had mild to moderate psoriasis with median 
PASI scores of 8.6 in PsA-I and 4.5 in PsA-II. In study PsA-I, the proportions of patients achieving 
PASI 50 response was 28.6% with abatacept vs. 14.3% with placebo (14.3 [-15.3, 43.9], estimate of 
difference [95% CI]), and the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 75 response was 14.3% with 
abatacept vs. 4.8% with placebo (9.5 [-13.0, 32.0], estimate of difference [95% CI]). In study PsA-II, 
the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 50 response was 26.7% with abatacept vs. 19.6% with 
placebo (7.3 [-2.2, 16.7], estimate of difference [95% CI]), and the proportion of patients who 
achieved PASI 75 response was 16.4% with abatacept vs. 10.1% with placebo (6.4 [-1.3, 14.1], 
estimate of difference [95% CI]).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Adult rheumatoid arthritis 
The geometric mean estimate (90% confidence interval) for the bioavailability of abatacept following 
subcutaneous administration relative to intravenous administration is 78.6% (64.7%, 95.6%). The 
mean (range) for cmin and cmax at steady state observed after 85 days of treatment was 
32.5 mcg/mL (6.6 to 113.8 mcg/mL) and 48.1 mcg/mL (9.8 to 132.4 mcg/mL), respectively. Mean 
estimates for systemic clearance (0.28 mL/h/kg), volume of distribution (0.11 L/kg), and terminal half-
life (14.3 days) were comparable between subcutaneous and intravenous administration. 
A single study was conducted to determine the effect of monotherapy use of abatacept on 
immunogenicity following subcutaneous administration without an intravenous load. When the 
intravenous loading dose was not administered, a mean trough concentration of 12.6 mcg/mL was 
achieved after 2 weeks of dosing. The efficacy response over time in this study appeared consistent 
with studies that included an intravenous loading dose, however, the effect of no intravenous load on 
the onset of efficacy has not been formally studied. 
Consistent with the intravenous data, population pharmacokinetic analyses for subcutaneous abatacept 
in RA patients revealed that there was a trend toward higher clearance of abatacept with increasing 
body weight. Age and gender (when corrected for body weight) did not affect apparent clearance. 
Concomitant MTX, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and TNF-inhibitors did not influence abatacept apparent 
clearance. 
Adult psoriatic arthritis 
In PsA-I, patients were randomised to receive intravenous placebo or abatacept 3 mg/kg (3/3 mg/kg), 
10 mg/kg (10/10 mg/kg), or two doses of 30 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg (30/10 mg/kg), on day 1, 
15, 29, and then every 28 days thereafter. In this study, the steady-state concentrations of abatacept 
were dose-related. The geometric mean (CV%) cmin at day 169 were 7.8 mcg/mL (56.3%) for the 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3/3 mg/kg, 24.3 mcg/mL (40.8%) for 10/10 mg/kg, and 26.6 mcg/mL (39.0%) for the 30/10 mg/kg 
regimens. 
In study PsA-II following weekly subcutaneous administration of abatacept at 125 mg, steady-state of 
abatacept was reached at day 57 with the geometric mean (CV%) cmin ranging from 22.3 (54.2%) to 
25.6 (47.7%) mcg/mL on days 57 to 169, respectively. 
Consistent with the results observed earlier in RA patients, population pharmacokinetic analyses for 
abatacept in PsA patients revealed that there was a trend toward higher clearance (L/h) of abatacept 
with increasing body weight. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No mutagenicity or clastogenicity was observed with abatacept in a battery of in vitro studies. In a 
mouse carcinogenicity study, increases in the incidence of malignant lymphomas and mammary gland 
tumours (in females) occurred. The increased incidence of lymphomas and mammary tumours 
observed in mice treated with abatacept may have been associated with decreased control of murine 
leukaemia virus and mouse mammary tumour virus, respectively, in the presence of long-term 
immunomodulation. In a one-year toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, abatacept was not 
associated with any significant toxicity. Reversible pharmacological effects consisted of minimal 
transient decreases in serum IgG and minimal to severe lymphoid depletion of germinal centres in the 
spleen and/or lymph nodes. No evidence of lymphomas or preneoplastic morphological changes was 
observed, despite the presence of a virus, lymphocryptovirus, which is known to cause such lesions in 
immunosuppressed monkeys within the time frame of this study. The relevance of these findings to the 
clinical use of abatacept is unknown. 
In rats, abatacept had no undesirable effects on male or female fertility. Embryo-foetal development 
studies were conducted with abatacept in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 20 to 30 times a 
human 10 mg/kg dose and no undesirable effects were observed in the offspring. In rats and rabbits, 
abatacept exposure was up to 29-fold a human 10 mg/kg exposure based on AUC. Abatacept was 
shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits. In a pre- and postnatal development study with 
abatacept in rats, no undesirable effects were observed in pups of dams given abatacept at doses up 
to 45 mg/kg, representing 3-fold a human 10 mg/kg exposure based on AUC. At a dose of 200 mg/kg, 
representing 11-fold a human exposure at 10 mg/kg based on AUC, limited changes in immune 
function (a 9-fold increase in the mean T-cell-dependent antibody response in female pups and 
inflammation of the thyroid of 1 female pup out of 10 male and 10 female pups evaluated at this dose) 
were observed. 
Non-clinical studies relevant for use in the paediatric population 
Studies in rats exposed to abatacept have shown immune system abnormalities including a low 
incidence of infections leading to death (juvenile rats). In addition, inflammation of the thyroid and 
pancreas was frequently seen in both juvenile and adult rats exposed to abatacept. Juvenile rats seemed 
to be more sensitive to lymphocytic inflammation of thyroid. Studies in adult mice and monkeys have 
not demonstrated similar findings. It is likely that the increased susceptibility to opportunistic 
infections observed in juvenile rats is associated with the exposure to abatacept before development of 
memory responses. The relevance of these results to humans is unknown.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What ORENCIA is and what it is used for 
ORENCIA contains the active substance abatacept, a protein produced in cell cultures. ORENCIA 
lessens the immune system's attack on normal tissues by interfering with the immune cells (called T 
lymphocytes) that contribute to the development of rheumatoid arthritis. ORENCIA selectively 
modulates the activation of T cells involved in the immune systems’ inflammatory response. 
ORENCIA is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis in adults and also polyarticular 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 6 years of age and older. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term progressive systemic disease that, if untreated, can lead to serious 
consequences, such as joint destruction, increased disability and impairment of daily activities. In 
people with rheumatoid arthritis the body's own immune system attacks normal body tissues, leading 
to pain and swelling of the joints. This can cause joint damage. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 
everyone differently. In most people, joint symptoms develop gradually over several years. However, 
in some, RA may progress rapidly and yet other people may have RA for a limited period of time and 
then enter a period of remission. RA is usually a chronic (long-term), progressive disease. This means, 
even if you’re on treatment, whether or not you’re still having symptoms, RA could be continuing to 
damage your joints. By finding the right treatment plan for you, you may be able to slow down this 
disease process, which may help reduce long-term joint damage, as well as pain and fatigue and 
improve your overall quality of life. 
ORENCIA is used to treat moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis when you do not respond 
well enough to treatment with other disease-modifying medicines or with another group of medicines 
called 'tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers'. It is used in combination with a medicine called 
methotrexate. 
ORENCIA can also be used with methotrexate to treat highly active and progressive rheumatoid 
arthritis without previous methotrexate treatment. 
Psoriatic Arthritis 
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis, an 
inflammatory disease of the skin. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you may be given ORENCIA to: 
 
 
 
Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. 
Slow down the damage to your bones and joints. 
Improve your physical function and your ability to do normal daily activities. 
122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ORENCIA is used to treat psoriatic arthritis alone or in combination with methotrexate. 
Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a long-term inflammatory disease affecting one or more 
joints in children and adolescents. 
ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is used in children and adolescents aged 6 
to 17 years when a previous disease-modifying medicine has not worked well enough or is not suitable 
for them. ORENCIA is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although ORENCIA may also 
be used alone in case of intolerance to methotrexate or if treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. 
ORENCIA is used to: 
- 
- 
- 
slow down the damage to joints 
improve physical function 
improve other signs and symptoms of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
2.  What you need to know before you are given ORENCIA 
You should not be given ORENCIA 
 
if you are allergic to abatacept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have a severe or uncontrolled infection, do not start treatment with ORENCIA. Having 
an infection could put you at risk of serious side effects from ORENCIA. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse: 
 
if you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or 
lightheadedness, swelling or skin rash tell your doctor immediately. 
if you have any kind of infection, including long-term or localised infection, if you often get 
infections or if you have symptoms of infection (e.g. fever, malaise, dental problems), it is 
important to tell your doctor. ORENCIA can lower your body's ability to fight infection and 
the treatment can make you more likely to get infections or make any infection you have worse. 
if you have had tuberculosis (TB) or have symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight 
loss, listlessness, mild fever) tell your doctor. Before you are given ORENCIA, your doctor 
will examine you for tuberculosis or do a skin test. 
if you have viral hepatitis tell your doctor. Before you are given ORENCIA, your doctor may 
examine you for hepatitis. 
if you have cancer, your doctor will decide if you can still be given ORENCIA. 
if you recently had a vaccination or are planning to have one, tell your doctor. Some vaccines 
should not be given while you are receiving ORENCIA. Check with your doctor before you 
are given any vaccines. It is recommended that patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current 
immunisation guidelines prior to starting ORENCIA therapy. Certain vaccinations may cause 
infections from the vaccine. If you received ORENCIA while you were pregnant, your baby 
may be at a higher risk for getting such an infection for up to approximately 14 weeks after the 
last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and 
other health care professionals about your ORENCIA use during your pregnancy so they can 
decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. 
if you are using a blood glucose monitor to check your blood glucose levels. ORENCIA 
contains maltose, which is a type of sugar that can give falsely high blood glucose readings with 
certain types of blood glucose monitors. Your doctor may recommend a different method for 
monitoring your blood glucose levels. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor may also do tests to examine your blood values. 
123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children and adolescents 
ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution for infusion has not been studied in children and 
adolescents under 6 years of age, therefore ORENCIA powder for concentrate for infusion is not 
recommended for use in this patient population. 
ORENCIA solution for injection pre-filled syringe is available for subcutaneous administration for 
paediatric patients 2 years of age and older. 
Other medicines and ORENCIA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
ORENCIA should not be used with biological medicines for rheumatoid arthritis, including TNF-
blockers like adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab; there is not enough evidence to recommend its 
being given with anakinra and rituximab. 
ORENCIA can be received with other medicines commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, such 
as steroids or painkillers, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen or diclofenac. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any other medicine while using ORENCIA. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
The effects of ORENCIA in pregnancy are not known, so you should not be given ORENCIA if you 
are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. 
 
 
if you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use reliable contraception (birth 
control) while using ORENCIA and up to 14 weeks after the last dose. Your doctor will advise 
you on suitable methods. 
if you become pregnant while using ORENCIA, tell your doctor. 
If you received ORENCIA during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an 
infection. It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about 
your ORENCIA use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more 
information see section on vaccination). 
It is not known whether ORENCIA passes into human milk. You must stop breast-feeding if you are 
being treated with ORENCIA and for up to 14 weeks after the last dose. 
Driving and using machines 
The use of ORENCIA is not expected to affect the ability to drive, cycle or use machines. However, if 
you are feeling tired or unwell after receiving ORENCIA, you should not drive, cycle or operate any 
machinery. 
ORENCIA contains sodium 
This medicine contains 34.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per maximum dose of 
4 vials (8.625 mg sodium per vial). This is equivalent to 1.7% of the recommended maximum daily 
dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How to use ORENCIA 
ORENCIA will be given to you under the supervision of an experienced doctor. 
124

Your doctor will advise you on the duration of treatment and what other medicines, including other 
disease-modifying medicines, if any, you may continue to take while on ORENCIA. 
ORENCIA can be used by adults over 65 with no change in dose. 
Use in children and adolescents 
For children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who 
weigh less than 75 kg, the recommended dose of intravenous abatacept is 10 mg/kg. Children 
weighing 75 kg or more should be administered ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion following the adult dosing regimen. 
How ORENCIA is given to you 
ORENCIA is given to you into a vein, usually in your arm, over a period of 30 minutes. This 
procedure is referred to as an infusion. Healthcare professionals will monitor you while you receive 
your ORENCIA infusion. 
ORENCIA is supplied as a powder for solution for infusion. This means that before ORENCIA is 
given to you, it is first dissolved in water for injections, then further diluted with sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
How often ORENCIA is given to you 
ORENCIA should be given to you again, 2 and then 4 weeks after the first infusion. After that you 
will receive a dose every 4 weeks. Your doctor will advise you on the duration of treatment and what 
other medicines you may continue to take while on ORENCIA. 
If you are given more ORENCIA than you should 
If this happens, your doctor will monitor you for any signs or symptoms of side effects, and treat these 
symptoms if necessary. 
If you forget to receive ORENCIA 
If you miss receiving ORENCIA when you are supposed to, ask your doctor when to schedule your 
next dose. 
If you stop using ORENCIA 
The decision to stop using ORENCIA should be discussed with your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only 
Reconstitution and dilution should be performed in accordance with good practices rules, particularly 
with respect to asepsis. 
Dose selection: see section 3 ‘How to use ORENCIA’ of the Package Leaflet 
Reconstitution of vials: under aseptic conditions, reconstitute each vial with 10 mL of water for 
injections, using the silicone-free disposable syringe provided with each vial and an 18-21 gauge 
needle. Remove the flip-top from the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol swab. Insert the syringe 
needle into the vial through the centre of the rubber stopper and direct the stream of water for 
injections to the glass wall of the vial. Do not use the vial if a vacuum is not present. Remove the 
syringe and needle after 10 mL of water for injections have been injected into the vial. To minimise 
foam formation in solutions of ORENCIA the vial should be rotated with gentle swirling until the 
contents are completely dissolved. Do not shake. Do not use prolonged or vigorous agitation. Upon 
complete dissolution of the powder, the vial should be vented with a needle to dissipate any foam that 
may be present. After reconstitution the solution should be clear and colourless to pale yellow. Do not 
use if opaque particles, discolouration, or other foreign particles are present. 
Preparation of infusion: immediately after reconstitution, dilute the concentrate to 100 mL with 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. From a 100 mL infusion bag or bottle, 
withdraw a volume of 0.9% sodium chloride injection equal to the volume of the reconstituted 
ORENCIA vials. Slowly add the reconstituted ORENCIA solution from each vial to the infusion bag 
or bottle using the same silicone-free disposable syringe provided with each vial. Gently mix. The 
final concentration of abatacept in the bag or bottle will depend upon the amount of active substance 
added, but will be no more than 10 mg/mL. 
Administration: when reconstitution and dilution are performed under aseptic conditions ORENCIA 
infusion solution can be used immediately or within 24 hours if stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C. 
However, for microbiological reasons, it is to be used immediately. Prior to administration, the 
128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ORENCIA solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration. Discard the 
solution if any particulate matter or discolouration is observed. The entire, fully diluted ORENCIA 
solution should be administered over a period of 30 minutes and must be administered with an 
infusion set and a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein-binding filter (pore size of 0.2 to 1.2 mcm). Do 
not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. 
Other medicines: ORENCIA should not be mixed with other medicines or infused concomitantly in 
the same intravenous line with other medicines. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have 
been conducted to evaluate the co-administration of ORENCIA with other medicines. 
Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to 
throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment.

ORENCIA can also be used with methotrexate to treat highly active and progressive rheumatoid 
arthritis without previous methotrexate treatment. 
130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ORENCIA is used to: 
-

Psoriatic Arthritis 
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis, an 
inflammatory disease of the skin. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you may be given ORENCIA to: 
 
 
 
Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. 
Slow down the damage to your bones and joints. 
Improve your physical function and your ability to do normal daily activities. 
ORENCIA is used to treat psoriatic arthritis alone or in combination with methotrexate. 
Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a long-term inflammatory disease affecting one or more 
joints in children and adolescents. 
ORENCIA solution for injection in pre-filled syringe is used in children and adolescents aged 2 to 
17 years when a previous disease-modifying medicine has not worked well or is not suitable for them. 
ORENCIA is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although ORENCIA may also be used 
alone if treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. 
ORENCIA is used to: 
 
 


2.  What you need to know before you use ORENCIA 
Do not use ORENCIA 
 
if you are allergic to abatacept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have a severe or uncontrolled infection, do not start treatment with ORENCIA. Having 
an infection could put you at risk of serious side effects from ORENCIA. 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
if you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or 
lightheadedness, swelling or skin rash tell your doctor immediately. 
if you have any kind of infection, including long-term or localised infection, if you often get 
infections or if you have symptoms of infection (e.g. fever, malaise, dental problems), it is 
important to tell your doctor. ORENCIA can lower your body's ability to fight infection and 
the treatment can make you more likely to get infections or make any infection you have worse. 
if you have had tuberculosis (TB) or have symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight 
loss, listlessness, mild fever) tell your doctor. Before you use ORENCIA, your doctor will 
examine you for tuberculosis or do a skin test. 
if you have viral hepatitis tell your doctor. Before you use ORENCIA, your doctor may 
examine you for hepatitis. 
if you have cancer, your doctor will decide if you can still be given ORENCIA. 
if you recently had a vaccination or are planning to have one, tell your doctor. Some vaccines 
should not be given while you are receiving ORENCIA. Check with your doctor before you 
are given any vaccines. Certain vaccinations may cause infections from the vaccine. If you 
131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
received ORENCIA while you were pregnant, your baby may be at a higher risk for getting 
such an infection for up to approximately 14 weeks after the last dose you received during 
pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals 
about your ORENCIA use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should 
receive any vaccine. 
Your doctor may also do tests to examine your blood values. 
Children and adolescents 
ORENCIA solution for injection in pre-filled syringe has not been studied in children and adolescents 
under 2 years of age. Therefore, ORENCIA solution for injection in pre-filled syringe is not 
recommended for use in this patient population. 
Other medicines and ORENCIA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
ORENCIA should not be used with biological medicines for rheumatoid arthritis, including TNF-
blockers like adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab; there is not enough evidence to recommend its 
being given with anakinra and rituximab. 
ORENCIA can be used with other medicines commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, such as 
steroids or painkillers, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen or diclofenac. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any other medicine while using ORENCIA. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
The effects of ORENCIA in pregnancy are not known, so do not use ORENCIA if you are pregnant 
unless your doctor specifically recommends it. 
 
 
if you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use reliable contraception (birth 
control) while using ORENCIA and up to 14 weeks after the last dose. Your doctor will advise 
you on suitable methods. 
if you become pregnant while using ORENCIA, tell your doctor. 
If you received ORENCIA during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an 
infection. It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about 
your ORENCIA use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more 
information see section on vaccination). 
It is not known whether ORENCIA passes into human milk. You must stop breast-feeding if you are 
being treated with ORENCIA and for up to 14 weeks after the last dose. 
Driving and using machines 
The use of ORENCIA is not expected to affect the ability to drive, cycle or use machines. However, if 
you are feeling tired or unwell after receiving ORENCIA, you should not drive, cycle or operate any 
machinery. 
ORENCIA contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-
free'. 
3. 
How to use ORENCIA 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
ORENCIA solution for injection is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use). 
132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recommended dose in adults 
The recommended dose of ORENCIA for adults with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis is 
125 mg given every week regardless of weight. 
Your doctor may start your ORENCIA treatment with or without a one-time dose of powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion (given to you into a vein, usually in your arm, over a period of 
30 minutes). If a single intravenous dose is given to start the treatment, the first subcutaneous injection 
of ORENCIA should be given within a day of the intravenous infusion, followed by the weekly 
125 mg subcutaneous injections. 
ORENCIA can be used by adults over 65 with no change in dose. 
Use in children and adolescents 
For patients 2 to 17 years of age with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, the recommended 
weekly dose of ORENCIA solution for injection in pre-filled syringe is based on body weight: 
Weekly Dose of ORENCIA 
Dose 
50 mg 
87.5 mg 
125 mg 
Body Weight of Patient 
10 kg to less than 25 kg 
25 kg to less than 50 kg 
50 kg or more 
If you are already on intravenous ORENCIA treatment and wish to transition to ORENCIA 
subcutaneous, you should receive a subcutaneous injection instead of your next intravenous infusion, 
followed by weekly subcutaneous injections of ORENCIA. 
Your doctor will advise you on the duration of treatment and what other medicines, including other 
disease-modifying medicines, if any, you may continue to take while on ORENCIA. 
At the start, your doctor or nurse may inject ORENCIA. However, you and your doctor may decide 
that you can inject ORENCIA yourself. In this case, you will get training on how to inject ORENCIA 
yourself. 
Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about giving yourself an injection. You will find 
detailed instructions for the preparation and administration of ORENCIA at the end of this leaflet (see 
"Important instructions for use"). 
If you use more ORENCIA than you should 
If this happens, contact immediately your doctor who will monitor you for any signs or symptoms of 
side effects, and treat these symptoms if necessary. 
If you forget to use ORENCIA 
Keep track of your next dose. It is very important to use ORENCIA exactly as prescribed by your 
doctor. If you miss your dose within three days of when you are supposed to take it, take your dose as 
soon as you remember and then follow your original dosing schedule on your chosen day. If you miss 
your dose by more than three days, ask your doctor when to take your next dose. 
If you stop using ORENCIA 
The decision to stop using ORENCIA should be discussed with your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What ORENCIA is and what it is used for 
ORENCIA contains the active substance abatacept, a protein produced in cell cultures. ORENCIA 
lessens the immune system's attack on normal tissues by interfering with the immune cells 
(called T lymphocytes) that contribute to the development of rheumatoid arthritis. ORENCIA 
selectively modulates the activation of T cells involved in the immune system's inflammatory 
response. 
ORENCIA is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis in adults. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term progressive systemic disease that, if untreated, can lead to serious 
consequences, such as joint destruction, increased disability and impairment of daily activities. In 
people with rheumatoid arthritis the body's own immune system attacks normal body tissues, leading 
to pain and swelling of the joints. This can cause joint damage. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 
everyone differently. In most people, joint symptoms develop gradually over several years. However, 
in some, RA may progress rapidly and yet other people may have RA for a limited period of time and 
then enter a period of remission. RA is usually a chronic (long-term), progressive disease. This means, 
even if you’re on treatment, whether or not you’re still having symptoms, RA could be continuing to 
damage your joints. By finding the right treatment plan for you, you may be able to slow down this 
disease process, which may help reduce long-term joint damage, as well as pain and fatigue and 
improve your overall quality of life. 
ORENCIA is used to treat moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis when you do not respond 
well enough to treatment with other disease-modifying medicines or with another group of medicines 
called 'tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers'. It is used in combination with a medicine called 
methotrexate. 
ORENCIA can also be used with methotrexate to treat highly active and progressive rheumatoid 
arthritis without previous methotrexate treatment. 
151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ORENCIA is used to: 
- 
- 
slow down the damage to your joints 
improve your physical function 
Psoriatic Arthritis 
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis, an 
inflammatory disease of the skin. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you may be given ORENCIA to: 
 
 
 
Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. 
Slow down the damage to your bones and joints. 
Improve your physical function and your ability to do normal daily activities. 
ORENCIA is used to treat psoriatic arthritis alone or in combination with methotrexate 
2.  What you need to know before you use ORENCIA 
Do not use ORENCIA 
 
if you are allergic to abatacept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have a severe or uncontrolled infection, do not start treatment with ORENCIA. Having 
an infection could put you at risk of serious side effects from ORENCIA. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse: 
 
if you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or 
lightheadedness, swelling or skin rash tell your doctor immediately. 
if you have any kind of infection, including long-term or localised infection, if you often get 
infections or if you have symptoms of infection (e.g. fever, malaise, dental problems), it is 
important to tell your doctor. ORENCIA can lower your body's ability to fight infection and 
the treatment can make you more likely to get infections or make any infection you have worse. 
if you have had tuberculosis (TB) or have symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight 
loss, listlessness, mild fever) tell your doctor. Before you use ORENCIA, your doctor will 
examine you for tuberculosis or do a skin test. 
if you have viral hepatitis tell your doctor. Before you use ORENCIA, your doctor may 
examine you for hepatitis. 
if you have cancer, your doctor will decide if you can still be given ORENCIA. 
if you recently had a vaccination or are planning to have one, tell your doctor. Some vaccines 
should not be given while you are receiving ORENCIA. Check with your doctor before you 
are given any vaccines. Certain vaccinations may cause infections from the vaccine. If you 
received ORENCIA while you were pregnant, your baby may be at a higher risk for getting 
such an infection for up to approximately 14 weeks after the last dose you received during 
pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals 
about your ORENCIA use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should 
receive any vaccine.

Your doctor may also do tests to examine your blood values. 
Children and adolescents 
ORENCIA solution for injection in pre-filled pen has not been studied in children and adolescents 
under the age of 18 years. Therefore, ORENCIA solution for injection in pre-filled pen is not 
recommended for use in this patient population. 
ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is available for paediatric patients 6 years 
of age and older.

ORENCIA solution for injection pre-filled syringe is available for paediatric patients 2 years of age 
and older. 
Other medicines and ORENCIA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
ORENCIA should not be used with biological medicines for rheumatoid arthritis, including TNF-
blockers like adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab; there is not enough evidence to recommend its 
being given with anakinra and rituximab. 
ORENCIA can be used with other medicines commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, such as 
steroids or painkillers, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen or diclofenac. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any other medicine while using ORENCIA. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
The effects of ORENCIA in pregnancy are not known, so do not use ORENCIA if you are pregnant 
unless your doctor specifically recommends it. 
 
 
if you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use reliable contraception (birth 
control) while using ORENCIA and up to 14 weeks after the last dose. Your doctor will advise 
you on suitable methods. 
if you become pregnant while using ORENCIA, tell your doctor. 
If you received ORENCIA during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an 
infection. It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about 
your ORENCIA use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more 
information see section on vaccination). 
It is not known whether ORENCIA passes into human milk. You must stop breast-feeding if you are 
being treated with ORENCIA and for up to 14 weeks after the last dose. 
Driving and using machines 
The use of ORENCIA is not expected to affect the ability to drive or use machines. However, if you 
are feeling tired or unwell after receiving ORENCIA, you should not drive or operate any machinery. 
ORENCIA contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-
free'. 
3. 
How to use ORENCIA 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
ORENCIA solution for injection is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use). 
Recommended dose 
The recommended dose of ORENCIA for adults with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis is 
125 mg abatacept given every week regardless of weight. 
Your doctor may start your ORENCIA treatment with or without a one-time dose of powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion (given to you into a vein, usually in your arm, over a period of 
30 minutes). If a single intravenous dose is given to start the treatment, the first subcutaneous injection 
of ORENCIA should be given within a day of the intravenous infusion, followed by the weekly 
125 mg subcutaneous injections. 
153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ORENCIA can be used by adults over 65 with no change in dose. 
If you are already on intravenous ORENCIA treatment and wish to transition to ORENCIA 
subcutaneous, you should receive a subcutaneous injection instead of your next intravenous infusion, 
followed by weekly subcutaneous injections of ORENCIA. 
Your doctor will advise you on the duration of treatment and what other medicines, including other 
disease-modifying medicines, if any, you may continue to take while on ORENCIA. 
At the start, your doctor or nurse may inject ORENCIA. However, you and your doctor may decide 
that you can inject ORENCIA yourself. In this case, you will get training on how to inject ORENCIA 
yourself. 
Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about giving yourself an injection. You will find 
detailed instructions for the preparation and administration of ORENCIA at the end of this leaflet (see 
"Important instructions for use"). 
If you use more ORENCIA than you should 
If this happens, contact immediately your doctor who will monitor you for any signs or symptoms of 
side effects, and treat these symptoms if necessary. 
If you forget to use ORENCIA 
Keep track of your next dose. It is very important to use ORENCIA exactly as prescribed by your 
doctor. If you miss your dose within three days of when you are supposed to take it, take your dose as 
soon as you remember and then follow your original dosing schedule on your chosen day. If you miss 
your dose by more than three days, ask your doctor when to take your next dose. 
If you stop using ORENCIA 
The decision to stop using ORENCIA should be discussed with your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

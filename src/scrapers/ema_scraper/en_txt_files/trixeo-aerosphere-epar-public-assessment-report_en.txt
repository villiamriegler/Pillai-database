2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) document (updated in 2017) defines COPD 
as “a common preventable and treatable disease that is characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms 
and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant 
exposure to noxious particles or gases” (GOLD 2020).
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention
COPD is a major public health problem and is the fourth leading cause of death in the world, with increasing 
prevalence and mortality predicted in the coming decades. COPD is projected to be the third leading cause of 
death by 2020. 
The main risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoking. However, other environmental exposures such as biomass 
fuel exposure and air pollution may also contribute. Host factors (e.g. genetic abnormalities, abnormal lung 
function and accelerated aging) predispose individuals to develop COPD.
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis
The chronic airflow limitation that is characterised of COPD is caused by a mixture of small airway disease 
(e.g. obstructive bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema). The relative contributions vary 
from person to person and evolve at different rates over time. Chronic inflammation causes structural 
changes, narrowing of the small airways and destruction of the lung parenchyma leading to the loss of 
alveolar attachments to the small airways and decreased lung elastic recoil.
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 9/238
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis
COPD is characterised by cough, dyspnoea on exertion or even at rest, with a consequent reduction of 
physical activity and deterioration of quality of life (QoL) (GOLD 2017). The inflammatory response 
contributes to small airways disease (e.g. obliterative bronchiolitis) and emphysema, which in turn reduce the 
elastic recoil of the lungs leading to collapse and obstruction of the small airways during exhalation. Systemic 
features of COPD are very common (Barnes PJ and Celli BR 2009) and their evaluation allows a more 
accurate prediction of mortality risk and comorbidity risk than lung function alone (Cote CG et al. 2007, De 
Torres JP et al. 2009, Puhan MA et al. 2009).
During the natural course of COPD, the majority of patients develop acute episodes of worsening of 
symptoms that differ from the day to day variations and may require modifications in therapy (GOLD 2017). 
These episodes are referred to as exacerbations. COPD exacerbations are important because they are 
associated with accelerated FEV1 decline (Donaldson GC et al. 2002), significant morbidity, healthcare cost 
and mortality (Celli BR and Barnes PJ 2007).
According to the GOLD criteria, the assessment of the disease severity should take into account various 
aspects of the disease such as symptoms, degree of airflow limitation, exacerbation risk and comorbidities. 
Based on the overall disease severity, COPD patients can be divided into the following four groups:
•
•
•
•
Group A (i.e. patients with low risk [of future events such as exacerbations, hospital admissions or 
death] and less symptoms);
Group B (i.e. patients with low risk more symptoms);
Group C (i.e. patients with high risk and less symptoms);
Group D (i.e. patients with high risk and more symptoms).
2.1.5.  Management
In COPD, the therapeutic goal is to reduce symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations 
and improve health status and exercise tolerance (GOLD 2017). The mainstay of treatment for symptomatic 
relief in stable COPD are bronchodilators and, as the disease worsens, ICS and phosphodiesterase 4-
inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents are recommended in combination with long acting bronchodilators.
The main classes of bronchodilators used in COPD are β2 (beta2) agonist and anti-cholinergic agents. β2 
agonists lead to relaxation and bronchodilation by stimulating the β2-adrenoreceptor on the airway smooth 
muscle. Short acting β2 agonists (SABAs; e.g. salbutamol and fenoterol) are used for acute bronchodilation 
and relief of symptoms. LABAs (e.g. salmeterol, FF and indacaterol) exhibit a prolonged duration of effect of 
12 hours or more and are used to achieve more sustained symptom control. Anti cholinergics (e.g. the short-
acting ipratropium bromide, and the long-acting GB and Tiotropium) exert their effect by blocking the effect 
of acetylcholine on the muscarinic receptors on the airway smooth muscles.
ICS treatment reduces the inflammation associated with COPD. When compared to placebo, long term use of 
ICS reduces the mean rate of exacerbations and improves QoL, as measured by the St George's Respiratory 
Questionnaire (SGRQ). Response to ICS is not predicted by bronchodilator reversibility or bronchial hyper-
responsiveness.
Although up to 20% of patients with moderate airflow limitation may experience frequent exacerbations, the 
risk of exacerbations significantly increases in patients with severe and very severe airflow limitation. In 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 10/238
 
 
COPD patients from Groups C and D (i.e. with high risk of exacerbation and with less or more symptoms, 
respectively), a fixed combination of ICS with a LABA or a LAMA alone is recommended as first choice of 
treatment (GOLD 2020).
Furthermore, several studies have shown that triple therapies consisting of two bronchodilators (such as a 
combination LABA and LAMA) and an ICS resulted in better efficacy in terms of lung function improvement 
and symptom control compared to bronchodilator monotherapies or ICS/LABA FDC (Singh D et al. 2008, 
Aaron SD et al. 2007, Welte T et al. 2009, Short PM et al. 2012). This enhanced effect is due to the fact that 
ICS, LABA and LAMA work together either synergistically or additively.
The mechanism of action both bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory action are central for the symptomatic 
treatment of COPD. Alongside airflow limitation, inflammation also plays a role in the pathophysiology of 
COPD. The effects of corticosteroids on the inflammatory pathway of COPD are subject of ongoing debate. 
However, when used in combination, ICSs such as budesonide may increase the number of β2-adrenoceptors 
while β2-agonists may induce glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation and therefore provide an 
additive/synergistic effect. 
International documents and guidelines (e.g. GOLD 2020) recommend the use of free (i.e. extemporary using 
different inhalers) and fixed dose triple combination of ICS, LABA and LAMA for the treatment of severe and 
symptomatic COPD patients.
About the product
BGF is a novel triple combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) and a 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). The product is a fixed dose combination of Budesonide (BD), 
formoterol fumarate (FF) and Glycopyrronium bromide (GB) intended for oral inhalation.
The doses and formulations of budesonide, glycopyrronium bromide, and formoterol fumarate in BGF MDI are 
the same as those used in the clinical development programs for the dual combinations of the following dual 
inhalers:
 Glycopyrronium bromide and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol (PT003; hereafter referred to 
as GFF MDI and also known as Bevespi Aerosphere.

And Budesonide and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol (PT009); hereafter referred to as BFF 
MDI) this FDC is not currently licensed.
BGF MDI is formulated as a suspension with micronised budesonide, micronised glycopyrronium bromide, and 
micronised formoterol fumarate crystals co-suspended with spray-dried porous particles (consisting of 1,2-
distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and calcium chloride) in a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant. The 
formulation used in the clinical studies is contained within a coated aluminium canister fitted with a metering 
valve, a plastic actuator, and a dose indicator.
Bevespi Aerosphere, the dual LAMA/LABA combination of GFF MDI, is included in the BGF MDI Phase III 
program as the approved LAMA/LABA comparator in the same MDI device as BGF MDI. 
The dual ICS/LABA combination of BFF MDI was developed by the applicant as an ICS/LABA comparator in 
the same MDI device as BGF MDI.
BGF MDI is designed to be administered twice daily (BID) and delivered by oral inhalation. The proposed 
strengths and doses of each component of BGF MDI are

BGF MDI Strength and Dosage
Type of Application and aspects on development
BGF is submitted as a new fixed dose combination referring to Article 10b of Directive 2001/83/EC via the 
optional scope of the Centralised Procedure according to Article 3(2)(b) (significant innovation or interest of 
patients at Community level) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004.
The clinical development programme of BGF was conducted according to the following CHMP guidelines:
-
-
-
CHMP/EWP/240/95 Rev. 1, February 2009: Guideline on clinical development of fixed combination 
medicinal products;
EMA/CHMP/483572/2012, 21 June 2012: Guideline on clinical investigations of medicinal products in 
the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD);
CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1, January 2009: Requirements for clinical documentation for orally inhaled 
products (OIP) including the requirements for demonstration of therapeutic equivalence between two 
inhaled products for use in the treatment of Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
(COPD) in adults and for use in the treatment of asthma in children and adolescents.
The BGF MDI clinical development program comprised the pivotal Phase III Study PT010006 that evaluated 
the efficacy (lung function, exacerbations, and symptoms) and safety of BGF MDI, and Study PT010008, a 
28-week extension of Study PT010006 that evaluated BMD, ocular assessments, safety, and moderate or 
severe COPD exacerbations after 52 weeks of treatment.
Scientific advice was given by the CHMP on the 18th of December 2014 (Procedure No.: 
EMEA/H/SA/2928/1/2014/III) with a follow up clarification on the 5th of August 2015.
 The Scientific advice pertained to the following non-clinical and clinical aspects:

Requirements for inhaled toxicology studies with the components (alone and in combination) to support 
clinical studies of up to 12 weeks in duration. Proposed nonclinical inhaled toxicology program, including 
3-month dog studies for BGF MDI, BFF MDI, and BD MDI, to support clinical studies of greater than 12 
weeks in duration. Acceptability of the proposed nonclinical development program to support MA of BGF 
MDI.

Selection of the budesonide dose in BGF MDI for Phase III studies based upon systemic PK comparability 
relative to Symbicort TBH (Study PT010002). Proposed two studies; a large 1-year exacerbation study 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 12/238
 
 
(PT010005) and a single 6-month lung function and symptom study (PT010006) to support a claim on 
“exacerbation benefit as well as positive effects on lung function and symptom benefits”. Proposal that, 
if systemic exposure to budesonide administered through the BFF MDI is shown to be equivalent to or 
lower than that when administered through Symbicort TBH, then the safety profile of budesonide from 
Symbicort TBH can be extrapolated to BFF MDI and BGF MDI without the need to conduct further HPA 
axis, bone mineral density, and ophthalmological assessments. Acceptability to enrol patients with more 
severe COPD, based on history of COPD exacerbations into the study investigating COPD exacerbations 
in order to be able to demonstrate a difference between treatments. Endpoint selection in the Lung 
Function Trial. Sufficiency of proposed studies to characterise drug-drug interaction potential of the 
combination product vs individual components. Strategy to assess effect on QTc interval.
2.2.  Quality aspects
Introduction
The finished product Trixeo Aerosphere (also referred to as BGF MDI) is presented as a pressurised inhalation 
suspension containing formoterol, glycopyrronium bromide and budesonide as active substances. The active 
moieties are formoterol fumarate, glycopyrronium and budesonide.
The delivered dose (the dose leaving the mouthpiece of the inhaler) from each actuation contains 5 
micrograms of formoterol fumarate dihydrate, 7.2 micrograms of glycopyrronium (equivalent to 9 
micrograms of glycopyrronium bromide), and 160 micrograms of budesonide. 
The metered dose (the dose leaving the valve of the inhaler) from each actuation contains, 8.3 micrograms 
of glycopyrronium (equivalent to 10.4 micrograms of glycopyrronium bromide), 5.8 micrograms of formoterol 
fumarate dihydrate and 182 micrograms of budesonide.
One dose consists of two actuations from the inhaler.

authorised products in the European market. 
Other ingredients are: norflurane, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and calcium chloride.
As described in section 6.5 of the SmPC, the product is available in a pressurised metered dose inhaler, 
comprising of an aluminium pressurised container with an attached dose indicator, supplied with a white 
plastic actuator body and mouthpiece with a grey dust cap. Each inhaler is individually packaged in a foil 
laminate pouch containing a desiccant sachet and packed in a carton.
2.2.1.  Active substances
Budesonide – micronised-
General information
The chemical name of budesonide is 16α,17-[(1RS)-butylidenebis(oxy)]-11β,21-dihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-
3,20-dione corresponding to the molecular formula C25H34O6. It has a relative molecular mass of 430.53 
g/mol and the following structure depicted in Figure 1
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 13/238
 
 
Figure 1: Budesonide structure
As there is a monograph of budesonide in the European Pharmacopoeia, the two proposed manufacturers of 
the active substance have been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for 
budesonide which have been provided within the current marketing authorisation application.
Budesonide is a white to off-white fine powder. The active substance is a non-hygroscopic; since budesonide 
is a non-protolyte, its solubility in water is not impacted by different pH values. 
Budesonide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre in the dioxolane ring (* C-22). 
Budesonide is a mixture, approximately 1:1, of epimer A (22S); the sum of the 2 epimers is controlled in the 
budesonide active substance specification as per Ph. Eur. monograph. 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by DSC, XRD and SEM confirming that only 
the one crystal form of budesonide has been manufactured.
.
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
Information on unmicronised budesonide has been supplied by two CEP holders. The relevant information has 
been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability.
Budesonide micronisation and conditioning is performed by manufacturer different from the CEP holder. To 
address a major objection description of the micronisation method, its development, controls and validation 
data has been provided. The micronisation has been adequately described. The micronisation process can be 
regarded as validated.
Micronised budesonide is stored in aluminium containers with a rubber gasket, aluminium lid and a snap-lock 
clamp.
Specification
The unmicronised budesonide complies with the current Ph. Eur. monograph for budesonide. The CEP lists an 
additional test for residual solvents. Micronised budesonide is tested for two additional critical attributes for 
inhalation products. Tests listed in the Ph. Eur. current monograph are description (visual) identity (IR, TLC, 
colorimetric tests), assay, content of ‘epimer A’ (the C-22S epimer), impurities, related substances (all using 
liquid chromatography, Ph. Eur.)

The two additional tests performed on the micronised budesonide are PSD (laser diffraction) and microbial 
tests limits (Ph.Eur.). 
The non-compendial laser diffraction test for the determination of the PSD has been adequately described 
and validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented. 
Stability
A retest period of 24 months is proposed for unmicronised budesonide from both suppliers. Based on the CEP 
for one supplier and the stability data provided a 24 months retest period for unmicronised budesonide when 
stored in the container described in the relevant CEP is supported.
Stability data from three production-scale batches of micronised budesonide stored for 24 months under 
long-term conditions (25°C / 60 % RH) and for 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75 % RH) in 
the proposed container closure system according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
All results complied with the specification for micronised budesonide and with the monograph for Budesonide 
Ph. Eur. No significant changes have been observed in any chemical parameters (assay, content of ‘epimer 
A’, related substances) or physical properties (appearance, particle-size distribution, loss on drying). The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating.
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months for micronised budesonide with no 
specified storage conditions in the proposed container.
Glycopyrronium bromide – micronised-
General information
According to the Ph.Eur., the chemical name of glycopyrronium bromide is 
3[(cyclopentylhydroxyphenylacetyl)oxy]-1,1-dimethyl pyrrolidinium bromide corresponding to the molecular 
formula C19H28BrNO3. It has a relative molecular mass of 398.3 g/mol and the following structure depicted in 
Figure 2 below.
Figure 2: Glycopyrronium bromide structure
As there is a monograph of glycopyrronium bromide in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the 
unmicronised active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia 
(CEP) for glycopyrronium bromide (unmicronised) which has been provided within the current Marketing 
Authorisation Application.
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 15/238
 
 
Glycopyrronium bromide is a white or almost white, crystalline powder, freely soluble in water, soluble in 
ethanol (96 per cent), very slightly soluble in methylene chloride. 
Glycopyrronium bromide has two chiral centres, so two pairs of enantiomers could exist. The active 
substance is a 50/50 mixture of threo enantiomers, (R,S) and (S,R). Thus, it is not optically active. Each 
batch of glycopyrronium bromide is tested for content of erythro enantiomers (R,R) and (S,S) (Ph.Eur. 
Impurity N) as part of routine quality control. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
The relevant information for the manufacture of the unmicronised glycopyrronium bromide has been 
assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability.
The micronisation and conditioning processes have been adequately described and can be regarded as 
validated.
Specification
Micronised glycopyrronium bromide complies with the current Ph.Eur. monograph with two additional tests 
for critical attributes for inhalation products.  Tests listed in the Ph. Eur. current monograph are description 
(visual), identity (IR, test for bromide), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), acidity or alkalinity (Ph. Eur.), 
assay (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), impurity N (Ph. Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying 
(Ph. Eur.). The two additional tests are PSD (laser diffraction) and microbial tests limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The microbial limits are in accordance with Ph. Eur. requirements. The CEP has an additional test for methyl 
bromide with method described. 
The non-compendial laser diffraction test for the determination of the PSD has been adequately described 
and validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for qualitative testing has been presented.
Batch analysis data 1 batch of unmicronised glycopyrronium bromide and 3 batches of micronised substance 
of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to 
batch.
Stability
A re-test period of 5 years for unmicronised glycopyrronium bromide is included in the CEP. 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of the micronised active substance from the proposed 
manufacturers (CEP holder and micronisation site) stored in a container closure system representative of that 
intended for the market for up to 48 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The chosen HPLC assay method detects the principal degradation product; hence, it is accepted not to use 
the Ph. Eur assay method (non-aqueous titrimetry) as it is non-specific. The other analytical methods used 
were the same as for release and were stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the 
specifications.

2.2.2.  Finished medicinal product
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development
The finished product is a pressurised inhalation suspension, also referred as pressurised metered dose inhaler 
(MDI), containing three active substances (budesonide, glycopyrronium bromide and formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate) in a fixed-dose combination, suspended thanks to the presence of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphocholine (DSPC) and calcium chloride dihydrate, which constitute the ‘porous particles’, in a in a 
medium of norflurane (propellant). The formulation is contained within a coated aluminium can fitted with a 
metering valve, a white plastic actuator, a grey plastic dust cap and a can-top dose indicator. The product is 
foil overwrapped with desiccant. 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 18/238
 
 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients. 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) 
used in the composition of the inhalation product Tobi-Podhaler (tobramycin), an inhalation powder approved 
in 2013, marketed by Novartis and in Bevespi Aerospheres an AstraZeneca centralised product 
(EMEA/H/C/4245) which was approved in December 2018. Calcium chloride dihydrate is as also used in the 
composition of the inhalation product Tobi-Podhaler. Norflurane (hydrofluoroalkane HFA-134a) is a propellant 
used in many marketed metered-dose inhalers (MDI). Hence, there are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 
2.1.1 of this report.
Three presentation of the product, 28, 56 and 120 actuations per container were developed and have been 
included in the stability programme. Approval was only requested for the 56 and 120 actuation presentation. 
The manufacturing formula includes an overfilling to ensure the labelled content of respectively 56 and 120 
actuations per inhaler. The suspension is formulated with micronised budesonide, micronised glycopyrronium 
bromide and micronised formoterol fumarate co-suspended with ‘porous particles’ in norfluorane propellant. 
Norfluorane was chosen as the propellant as it provides good suspension and aerosol properties. The ‘porous 
particles’ are included in the formulation as a suspension forming agent; the density of the porous particles is 
less than that of the propellant norflurane and they serve to prevent the sedimentation of the active 
substance crystals, providing a stable suspension with consistent aerosol properties. The surface of the 
‘porous particle’ is corrugated and due to the amphiphilic nature of the surface the cohesion between 
particles is reduced. The active substances adhere to the corrugated particle surface through a shape-fitting 
contact mechanism. 
The ‘porous particles’ are a spray-dried mixture of the two excipients DSPC (93%) and calcium chloride (7%) 
from an emulsified feedstock also containing water and perflubron as a pore-forming agent. Calcium chloride 
is used as it improves the stability of the porous particles. Calcium chloride meets the requirements of the 
Ph.Eur. monograph. Perflubron, which is not monographed in the Ph.Eur., meets the requirements of the 
USP, this is acceptable.
Satisfactory specifications of the ‘porous particles’ have been provided. They include tests for the critical 
quality attributes of the ‘porous particles’ identified during the development of Bevespi Aerosphere, consisting 
of description, identification via IR, residual perflubron, moisture content, compressed bulk density and 
particle size distribution. Stability studies have shown that little or no degradation of ‘porous particles’ DSPC 
occurs during storage of the product. Porous particles have been shown to be suitable for inhalation at the 
concentrations used in finished product. 
Norfluorane complies with the specification provided in the Ph. Eur. monograph for norflurane.
Non-compendial tests methods for ‘porous particles’ and norfluorane have been adequately described and 
validated. A satisfactory description of the manufacturing method of the porous particles, in line with Bevespi 
Aerosphere has been provided.
The pharmaceutical development has been conducted according to the quality guideline on inhalation 
products (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr) and is sufficiently well described.
APSD profiles have been provided for the three drug substances in all stages of the Next Generation Impactor 
for all Phase III clinical batches, as well as process validation batches, representative of the commercial 
process. The data show good repeatability with very little variation observed for each active substance. The 
relationship between the particle size distribution of the active substances and the product APSD has been

EMA/582495/2020

investigated. The specification limits for particle size distribution in each active substance is justified and will 
consistently yield a finished product with an acceptable fine particle mass per actuation.
Finished product characterisation studies have been conducted in accordance with the CHMP’s ‘Guideline on 
the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal Products’. Satisfactory information was provided in 
relation to fine particle mass (FPM) through container life, FPM with the recommended spacer, 
actuator/mouthpiece deposition, shaking requirements, priming and re-priming requirements, cleaning 
requirements, low temperature performance and robustness. 
A comprehensive list of the changes between the Phase III clinical product and the commercial product has 
been provided, together with a rationale, and justification for the change. 
The container closure system proposed for BGF MDI consists of a coated aluminium can fitted with a metering 
valve, a white plastic actuator, a grey plastic dust cap and a can-top dose indicator, the only differences are 
the dose counter as BGF MDI dose counter markings reflect the 2 presentations of 56-inhalation and 120-
inhlation and the colour of the dust cap. The product is foil overwrapped with desiccant. 
The components that are in direct contact with the formulation (valve components, silicone oil used as a 
valve lubricant, and the coated canister) were subjected to an extraction study using solvents with a range of 
polarities. The potential leachables were monitored in the finished product during the course of stability 
studies. The primary packaging materials comply with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. A satisfactory 
extractable and leachable study has been provided. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product
Manufacture of the product and process controls
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  six  main  steps:  dispensing,  bulk  suspension  preparation,  canister 
preparation, canister filling, dose indicator and actuator assembly and packaging. The canisters may be bulk 
packed as an optional step. The manufacturing process is satisfactorily described. The process is considered to 
be a non-standard manufacturing process.
It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner.  However, the CHMP recommended that full process validation on 
three commercial scale batches should be performed before marketing the product (REC).
Product specification 
The finished product release specification includes appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description 
of  the  product  (visual),  appearance  of  the  formulation  (visual),  identification  (high-performance  liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) and HPLC diode array assay), total can assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), 
DDU through canister life of both active substances and number of actuations per canister (dose unit sampling 
apparatus and HPLC), moisture content (Karl-Fisher), aerodynamic particle size distribution (next generation 
impactor), leak rate (weight loss) and microbial limits test (Ph.Eur.).
The tests and limits are in line with relevant guidance, including the ‘Guideline on the pharmaceutical quality 
of inhalation and nasal products’ and the Ph. Eur. ‘Preparations for Inhalation’ unless otherwise discussed. 
Leachables are not tested, as justified by development data.
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on batches using a 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020

validated method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 
30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded 
that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The 
information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.
A nitrosamine risk evaluation was provided in response to the major objection raised during the procedure. 
The risk evaluation outcome confirmed no risk of presence of nitrosamines has been identified.
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Small adaptations in sampling and/or methods from the Ph.Eur. methods have been 
adequately justified and validated.
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented.
Batch analysis results are provided for five commercial scale batches and one at pivotal clinical scale of the 
120-inhalation presentation and three commercial scale batches of the 56-inhalation presentation batches, 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. 
Stability of the product
Stability data were provided from three commercial scale batches of the 120-inhalation and the 28-inhalation 
development presentations of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 
60% RH), for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30°C / 75 % RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines although a higher relative humidity 
was used for the intermediate storage condition (75 % instead of 65 % RH). The stability samples were stored 
in both the upright and inverted orientations under all conditions. The batches of medicinal product were packed 
in the primary packaging proposed for marketing with the desiccant intended for the commercial pack. As the 
120-inhalation and the 28-inhalation presentations differ only in their fill weights and represent the largest and 
smallest  container  sizes,  an  acceptable  bracketing  approach  was  adopted  and  the  intermediate-sized  56-
inhalation presentation was not included in the stability studies.
Samples were tested for the same tests used at release, with the exception of identification, which was not 
tested.  Additional  tests  to  monitor  specific  impurities  were  also  performed.  The  tests  used  are  the  same  as 
those used at release, with the exception of the additional tests, for which the analytical methods have been 
validated.
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. All results complied with the product specification at all 
test points when stored at long-term conditions. No significant difference was noted between samples stored 
in the upright and inverted orientations. 
An in-use study was performed no out-of-specification results were observed.
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and with a 6-weeks in-use shelf life for 
the 56 actuations presentation and 3 months for the 120 actuations presentation, with the following storage 
conditions: “Do not store above 30°C. Do not expose to temperatures higher than 50°C. Do not pierce the 
pressurised container. Store in a dry place”, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

2.2.3.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects
The finished product Trixeo Aerosphere is as a pressurised inhalation suspension containing budesonide, 
glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate as active substances. The unmicronised active substances are the 
subjects of European Pharmacopoeia monographs and valid CEPs have been provided. To address one major 
objection for budesonide and one for formoterol fumarate dehydrate, the description of the micronisation 
method, its development, controls and validation data have been provided for budesonide and formoterol 
fumarate dihydrate during the procedure. The information provided on the micronisation of the three active 
substances is now considered satisfactory. In the finished product, the three micronised active substances 
are co-suspended with inert porous particles in a liquid propellant (norflurane).
The product development for Trixeo Aerosphere is based on the development of Bevespi Aerosphere, a 
product containing glycopyrronium and formoterol, a centrally authorised product (EMEA/H/C/4245) 
approved in December 2018. In particular, the pharmaceutical development, manufacturing process, control 
strategy and container closure system are very similar for the two products. A satisfactory nitrosamine risk 
assessment evaluation was provided during the procedure, in response to a major objection, confirming that 
no risk of nitrosamine presence was identified.
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The applicant is recommended that full process 
validation on three commercial scale batches should be performed before marketing the product.
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact 
on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, as summarised under ”Recommendations for future quality 
development”.
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.4.  Recommendations for future quality development  
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:
Full process validation on three full-scale batches should be performed before marketing the finished product 
Trixeo Aerosphere.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects
2.3.1.   Introduction
This application concerns an inhaled fixed dose combination of a glucocorticoid (budesonide), a long acting  
2-agonist (formoterol fumarate) and a long acting muscarinic antagonist (glycopyrronium). All of the active 
substances have been licenced products within the EU in inhalable dosage forms with budesonide licensed as 
PULMICORT® for the treatment of asthma, formoterol has been utilised clinically since 1986 including as an 
inhaled product OXIS® for the treatment of asthma and COPD, and glycopyrrolate licensed as SEEBRI® for 
the treatment of COPD. 
No new non-clinical proof of concept studies has been provided.  An in-depth literature review of the relevant 
pharmacology of each of the components as single agents, and the use of budesonide and formoterol in 
combination, has been provided. The rationale for including a glucocorticoid in the proposed formulation is 
based on the known clinically efficacy of glucocorticoids as an anti-inflammatory agent as well as the reported 
regulation and normalisation of the  2-adrenoreceptor by glucocorticoids. No non-clinical data has been 
provided as to the superiority of the fixed dose combination relative to their single use, or combinations 
thereof. However, it is accepted that clinical experience with these active substances in combination 
supersedes any such data and hence the absence of combination primary pharmacodynamic studies is 
considered appropriate.
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted on the BGF MDI combination product. This 
approach is acceptable as the secondary pharmacodynamics of the active ingredients of BGF MDI are well-
known and there is extensive clinical experience with the use of these agents alone or in combination. No 
additional secondary pharmacodynamics studies are required.
Standalone safety pharmacology studies have been not been performed for the fixed dose combination. 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory endpoints were included in the repeat dose toxicity studies 
performed with the fixed dose combination. No abnormalities in ECG parameters were noted in either the 14 
day or 3-months study in dogs. Mean increases in heart rate were seen which were low in magnitude and not 
considered adverse. Minor effects that were not considered of biological significance were seen for the 
respiratory parameters of tidal volume and minute volume in the 14-day study in dogs. No effects were seen 
in the 3-months study.
2.3.2.  Pharmacology
 Brief summary
The inhaled fixed dose triple combination of budesonide, glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate is being 
developed for the treatment of COPD.
Budesonide, a potent glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory properties, has been widely approved for the 
treatment of asthma (PULMICORT®), rhinitis (RHINOCORT®) and Crohn’s disease (ENTOCORT®).
Formoterol, a rapid, and long acting β2-agonist, has been in clinical use since 1986, first as an oral 
formulation (ATOCK®) and subsequently by inhalation (FORADIL®, OXIS®).
Glycopyrrolate, a potent muscarinic receptor antagonist is used intravenously during anaesthesia to reduce 
secretions and by inhalation, has been approved for the treatment of COPD (SEEBRI®).

Primary pharmacodynamics
No pharmacology studies have been conducted on the combination of budesonide, glycopyrrolate and 
formoterol but various inhaled combinations including one or more of these drugs are available as marketed 
products. Comprehensive information on the preclinical pharmacology of these substances can be found in 
their regulatory submissions and only the most relevant information is included herein.
Budesonide
Approved budesonide products have been launched in all major markets, supporting the documented efficacy 
and safety of budesonide for its intended indications.
Budesonide is a potent glucocorticoid with special kinetic properties. The inhalation or intratracheal (i.t.) 
administration of budesonide inhibited the increase in lung resistance during both the immediate and late 
asthmatic reactions. Moreover, budesonide inhibited the production and release of a variety of mediators and 
cytokines from inflammatory cells, the increases in airway eosinophil and vascular permeability, and the 
development of inflammatory lung oedema, all of which play important roles in airway inflammatory reactions 
of asthma. Finally, the unique mechanism of reversible esterification of budesonide with fatty acids prolongs 
its retention in the airways, improves its selectivity for the airway, and contributes to a long duration of 
action within the airways/lung.
In general pharmacology studies, budesonide did not produce any apparent effects on the cardiovascular, 
respiratory or central nervous systems. Repeated administration of budesonide to ovariectomised rats did not 
induce gestagen-like and uterotrophic effects. Furthermore, budesonide did not change the relaxant effect of 
a β2-agonist and theophylline on bronchoconstriction. Compared to other steroids, such as beclomethasone 
dipropionate, budesonide was more potent in exerting local anti-inflammatory effects than it was exerting 
systemic effects. Therefore, inhaled budesonide can achieve a favourable relation between the desired anti-
inflammatory activities in airways/lung versus the unwanted steroid actions in the systemic compartment.
Formoterol
Formoterol has been investigated thoroughly in nonclinical experiments for more than 20 years. Key 
information from preclinical publications and AstraZeneca reports on file are summarised.
Formoterol is a potent, selective, and efficacious β2-adrenoceptor agonist with a rapid onset, and long 
duration of action when inhaled. It is an almost full agonist at the β2-adrenoceptor. Due to its high β2-

subject to development of tolerance at extreme high doses, the bronchoprotective properties of formoterol 
are maintained during regular treatment.
The primary pharmacological effect of formoterol is relaxation of airway smooth muscle. Inhaled formoterol 
produces bronchodilatation at lower doses than oral formoterol in animal asthma models. Formoterol is more 
effective in vivo than salbutamol, regardless of the route of administration, and, in isolated trachea, 
formoterol is a more potent relaxant against contractions induced by bronchoconstrictor stimulants. 
Formoterol has an onset of action faster than that of salmeterol, and a duration of action longer than that of 
salbutamol. In addition to its bronchorelaxant amongst other effects, formoterol like other β2-agonists, can 
increase mucociliary transport.
The major part of the nonclinical documentation is based on studies performed with racemic formoterol, 
(R,R)/(S,S). A limited number of studies have been done with either enantiomer, all of which clearly 
demonstrated that the pharmacodynamic effects of formoterol reside almost entirely in the (R,R)-enantiomer. 
Since the potency of the (S,S)-enantiomer as a β2-agonist was practically negligible, and it does not seem to 
possess any other pharmacologic properties, the use of racemic formoterol is justified.
Glycopyrrolate
Glycopyrrolate, a potent muscarinic receptor antagonist, is used intravenously during anaesthesia to reduce 
secretions and, by inhalation, has been approved for the treatment of COPD (SEEBRI®). Although 
glycopyrrolate is not definitively selective for any of the muscarinic receptor sub types it does appear to have 
a lower affinity for M2 compared to M1/M3 subtypes. This may confer a therapeutic advantage and avoid the 
potential disadvantage of inhibiting pre-junctional M2 (inhibitory) auto receptors. The half-life and receptor 
kinetic differences between tiotropium and glycopyrrolate may, at least in part, account for marginal relative 
affinity differences at the M2 receptor.
Budesonide and formoterol combination
Because of the wide clinical experience with single and combined therapy of either drug, few non-clinical 
pharmacodynamic studies have been performed with the combination of budesonide and formoterol. In 
addition, it is difficult to identify suitable animal species and models for study of mechanistic interactions 
between the two drugs. None of the conventional laboratory animal species seem to have a balance between 
glucocorticoid and β2-adrenoceptor-mediated anti-asthmatic effects similar to that seen in man. The animal 
of choice for investigating β2-adrenoceptor agonists is the guinea pig although bronchodilation effects can be 
observed in rats, while the steroid-sensitive rats preferably are used to assess activity of glucocorticoids such 
as budesonide. Human airway cells, leukocytes including eosinophils, and ex vivo rat lungs were also 
employed in the investigative pharmacology.
Results from studies with various biological systems indicate that budesonide and formoterol act 
complementarily, additively or synergistically to produce enhanced anti-inflammatory, anti-remodelling, or 
anti-bronchoconstriction effects. These include the inhibitions of granulocyte  macrophage-colony stimulating 
factor (GM-CSF) release in human bronchial epithelial cells, the  expression of intercellular adhesion 
molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1  (VCAM-1) in human lung fibroblasts, oxidative 
burst in human eosinophils stimulated by epithelial cell-derived condition medium, inflammation-induced lung 
oedema, proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells, production of proteoglycans by lung fibroblasts, and the 
bronchoconstriction response to provocation. These mechanistic studies, some at signal transduction level, 
provide plausible explanations why the combination of budesonide and formoterol in asthma therapy delivers 
a greater benefit than either drug alone.
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020

There is a body of evidence suggesting that budesonide and other steroids support the signal through the β2-
adrenergic receptor. Such a mechanism provides a further rationale for the benefit of combined budesonide 
and formoterol therapy, however, the clinical significance of this mechanism is unproven.
Secondary pharmacodynamics
Specific secondary pharmacodynamic properties of budesonide, formoterol and glycopyrrolate in combination 
have not been studied nonclinically, due to the wide clinical experience of combined use of steroids and long-
acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists, and of long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists and muscarinic antagonists 
(including combining these properties into the same molecule). Most of the secondary pharmacodynamics of 
this triple combination are driven by formoterol and glycopyrrolate.
From the published literature, tachycardia, positive inotropy and skeletal muscle tremor are the most 
prominent secondary pharmacodynamic effects with respect to formoterol, in common with other β2-
adrenoceptor agonists. Similarly, tachycardia is associated with glycopyrrolate, in common with other 
muscarinic anatagonists.
Safety pharmacology programme
Standalone nonclinical safety pharmacology studies on the combination of budesonide, formoterol and 
glycopyrrolate have not been performed by AstraZeneca due to the wide clinical experience of combined use 
of steroids and long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists, and of long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists and 
muscarinic antagonists (including combining these properties into the same molecule). However, the 
electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory endpoints were included as part of 14-day and 3-month inhalation 
toxicology studies on the budesonide-formoterol-glycopyrrolate combination in dogs (FY14-036A and FY14-
148A, respectively), and any adverse effects on nervous system function would be expected to be detected 
during the twice-daily clinical observations in these two studies and in a 14-day rat inhalation toxicology 
study (FY14-033).
Potential functional effects of the budesonide-formoterol-glycopyrrolate combination on the nervous system 
were assessed in rat (14-day; FY14-033) and dog (14-day; FY14-036A; 3-month: FY14-148A) repeat-dose 
inhalation toxicology studies. No clinical signs related to effects on the nervous system were observed in 
either species. Lethargy was observed in three female rats in the high dose group from day 9 onwards (FY14-
033), and in one female dog in the mid-dose group in the 14-day study (FY14-036A).
An assessment of cardiovascular safety pharmacology was conducted as part of the 14-day dog inhalation 
study (FY14-036A) and in the 3-month dog inhalation study (FY14-148A), conducted on the budesonide-
formoterol-glycopyrrolate combination. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were assessed on all dogs prior to the first 
exposure, after the first exposure, at day 45 (3-month study only) and after the last exposure. There were no 
effects on the ECG at any dose level in the 3-month study, or other than secondary to the increase in heart 
rate in the 14-day study. In both studies there were heart rate increases on day 1 which were of low 
magnitude, within the normal range, and not considered adverse. The mean heart rate changes for all dose 
levels were attenuated on day 14 compared to day 1 (FY14-036A) but still present on day 90 in the high-
dose group in the 3-month study (FY14-148A).
An assessment of respiratory safety pharmacology was conducted as part of the 14-day dog inhalation study 
(FY14-036A) and in the 3-month dog inhalation study (FY14-148A), conducted on the budesonide-

formoterol-glycopyrrolate combination. In the 14-day study, group effects consisted of significantly higher 
minute volume in low, mid and high dose groups in males but not in females. In the 3-month study there was 
no statistically significant evidence to indicate differences between treated and control groups at the three 
measurement time points for all three parameters analysed for each gender. n the 3-months study.
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions
Pharmacodynamic interactions of budesonide, formoterol and glycopyrrolate in combination with other drugs 
have not been studied specifically by AstraZeneca.
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics
 Pharmacokinetic studies
The inhaled fixed dose triple combination of budesonide, glycopyrrolate (glycopyrronium bromide) and 
formoterol fumarate (BGF, also known as PT010) has been developed as an inhaled maintenance therapy in 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in a pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) formulation 
containing 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), calcium chloride (CaCl2) and 
hydrofluoroalkane 134a (HFA-134a). Specific absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) 
studies of the combination of budesonide, glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate have not been conducted 
since each of the individual active substances have previously been comprehensively investigated in support 
of existing approved products. General pharmacokinetic/ toxicokinetic (PK/TK) parameters were assessed in 
rats and dogs in (or in parallel to) the toxicity studies on the fixed dose combination and each active 
substance individually. All plasma samples have been analysed using validated bioanalytical methods. No 
specific nonclinical ADME studies on the combination have been conducted. 
Methods of analysis
Plasma (rat, dog, mouse and rabbit) was analysed using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS). The methodology for analysis of budesonide, formoterol and glycopyrrolate in plasma was 
developed and validated by Medtox Laboratories (US) and Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute (US). 
These methods were used to analyse each of the active components in the repeat inhalation toxicity studies 
conducted on the fixed dose combination as well the studies conducted on either active component 
individually. An overview of the methods is detailed in Table 1 below, and the relevant toxicology studies are 
highlighted.

Absorption 
The absorption of budesonide (BD), formoterol (FF) and glycopyrrolate (GP) following inhalation has been 
assessed in rats and dogs in the toxicity studies conducted on the fixed dose triple combination, dual 
combinations and each compound administered individually in similar pMDI formulations.
Repeat dose studies (rat)
1. Fixed-dose triple combination - BGF pMDI
Rats were exposed to BGF pMDI in a 14-day inhalation study. Plasma samples were taken at 30 minutes, 3 
hours and 24-hours post-exposure on Day 1 and Day 14 of the study. Plasma samples were analysed using 
validated methods (VP16-137) to measure budesonide, glycopyrrolate and formoterol concentrations. Due to 
the small number of samples, there was insufficient data to enable complete pharmacokinetic analysis. 
However, the data was reviewed for observational Cmax and tmax, gender correlation, and accumulation 
throughout the study. Overall, the data showed variability within each exposure group and between genders 
for all analytes. Tmax values were at the first blood collection time point. Rough dose proportionality with 
respect to Cmax was achieved and there appeared to be accumulation of formoterol and glycopyrrolate in 
various groups at the end of the study, which was not seen with budesonide (FY14-033). Observational 
average Cmax of BGF on Day 1 and 14 are outlined in Table 2.

Individual administration of budesonide (BD), formoterol (FF) and glycopyrrolate (GP) 
Rats were exposed to BD, FF and GP in 14-day repeat dose inhalation studies (FY14-035, FY09-039, FY-076) 
and a 6-month repeat dose inhalation study (GP, FY10-120). Plasma samples were taken at 30 minutes, 3 
hours and 24-hours post-exposure on Day 1 and Day 14 of the study. Samples were analysed using validated 
methods to measure BD, FF and GP concentrations. Due to the small number of samples, there was 
insufficient data to enable complete pharmacokinetic analysis (n=2 animals/sex/time). Proof of absorption of 
BD was demonstrated and tmax was observed at 0.5h post exposure. Accumulation of BD was observed at 
some timepoints by comparison of Day 14 and Day 1 results. It is difficult to draw any conclusions due to 
lack of consistency as well as the limited samples size but systemic exposure to budesonide at each dose 
level was confirmed. Proof of FF absorption was demonstrated and tmax was generally observed at the first 
blood collection time point. Overall the data showed variability within each exposure group and between 
genders. There appeared to be a small amount of accumulation of formoterol in plasma after repeated dosing 
for 14 days. Proof of absorption of GP was demonstrated and tmax was observed at the first blood collection 
time point in most cases. In general, Cmax increased dependent on doses with both genders, however the 
overall data indicated individual animal variability. In the 6-month toxicity study a single plasma sample was 
taken from each rat (n=15 animals/dose/sex) on the last day of exposure and analysed for GP concentrations 
using a validated bioanalytical method. Observational tmax and Cmax of BD, GP and FF individual 
administration on Day 1 and 14 are outlined in Table 3, in addition to mean plasma concentrations of GP on 
the last day of exposure of a 6-month rat toxicity study.

bioanalytical methods. In both studies a dose proportionality was observed for all compounds and tmax was 
generally observed in the first sample taken immediately post exposure. No obvious differences between 
male and female dogs could be observed. After 14 days of exposure, a clear accumulation of all compounds 
was observed as well as an extended t1/2. Similarly, after 90 days of exposure, there was evidence of clear 
accumulation in both Cmax and AUC β2 and extended plasma t1/2. The concentrations of GP and FF were 
below the LLOQ at the lowest fixed-combination dose.  Mean TK parameters of BD, GP and FF in dogs after 
14-day inhalation of fixed dose combination BGF are detailed in Table 4.

Individual administration of budesonide (BD), formoterol (FF) and glycopyrrolate (GP) 
The TK of BD, FF and GP when administered individually have been evaluated in 14-day and 3-month 
repeat dose inhalation studies in dogs (GP also evaluated in a 6-month study). As with the rat studies, 
samples were taken at through 24 hours after the first (Day 1) and last (Day 14 and 90, respectively) 
exposure and were analysed for BD/FF/GP concentrations using a validated bioanalytical method. 
14-day studies: For BD, dose proportionality was observed in the low and mid exposure group, although, 
the mid and high exposure group were similar on day 1 due to the aerosol concentrations achieved on 
day 1 being similar doses that study day. After repeated dosing for 14 days there was a clear 
accumulation in both Cmax and AUC. For FF, dose proportionality was observed in the systemic exposure 
to formoterol, with Cmax generally observed in the first sample taken post exposure with the exception 
of a few animals. The data was variable within each exposure group and between genders, however, 
concentrations and AUC estimates appeared to increase dose-dependently throughout the study. For GP, 
tmax occurred immediately post exposure for all animals on the first day of exposure and Cmax and AUC 
estimates were dose-dependent. On Day 14, TK data was more variable between exposure groups and 
genders and, AUC estimates appeared to increase dose-dependently throughout the study. Mean TK 
parameters of BD, GP and FF in dogs after in dogs after 14-day inhalation of individual components are 
detailed in

3/6 month studies: For BD, a dose response was observed in the systemic exposure to BD and the increase 
in AUC after 90 days of exposure indicates accumulation over the study period and some increase in t1/2 was 
also observed. Cmax was generally observed within 30 minutes of exposure (also in 14-day study). For FF, 
AUC increased after 90 days of exposure indicating accumulation of FF over the study period. An increase in 
t1/2 was observed (statistically insignificant) after repeated exposure; an overall dose-dependent response in 
AUC was generally observed also. For GP, Cmax was typically reached either immediately post exposure or, 
rarely, at 30 minutes post exposure and dose proportionality with respect to Cmax and AUC estimates was 
achieved. GP disappeared from the plasma with a mean t1/2 ranging from 6.10-12.45 hours and some 
accumulation of GP was observed in all dose groups after repeated exposure. Mean TK parameters of BD, GP 
and FF in dogs after in dogs after 3-month (and 6 month (GP)) inhalation of individual components are 
detailed in Table 7.

Distribution
No distribution studies have been conducted on the fixed dose combination of budesonide, glycopyrrolate and 
formoterol fumarate. The plasma protein binding data of budesonide and formoterol have been previously 
submitted by AstraZeneca but are included in this submission for reference.
Protein binding and distribution in blood cells
Budesonide (850-RD-0349, 850-RD-0353)
The unbound fraction of budesonide in plasma, at the concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 nmol/L was 
independent of the budesonide concentration, and ranged from 14.0% to 14.2% in mouse plasma, 7.7% to 
8.4% in rat plasma, 12.5% to 15.3% in rabbit plasma, 10.4% to 11.2% in dog plasma, and 12.8% to 14.5% 
in human plasma (850-RD-0349). The protein binding of budesonide is similar to that reported for other 
synthetic glucocorticoids. The distribution ratio of budesonide between whole blood and plasma (Cb/Cp), at 
the blood concentration of 0.1, 1 and 10 nmol/L was determined to be 0.85 in mouse, 0.78 in rat, 0.90 in 
rabbit, 0.71 in dog and 0.81 in human, all of which were independent of the concentration of budesonide in 
the blood (850-RD-0353).
Formoterol (843-RD-0354)
The plasma protein binding of the RR- and SS-enantiomers of formoterol was studied in vitro in plasma from 
man, dog, rabbit and rat (843-RD-0354). The study was performed at a racemic ratio of 50/50 with each

tritium labelled enantiomer mixed with its unlabelled antipode. The binding of each enantiomer was studied 
separately at 10, 100 and 500 nmol/L concentrations of the racemate by ultrafiltration. There was no 
influence of concentration on protein binding of neither RR nor SS- formoterol in any species and the mean 
(SD) unbound fractions of the RR and SS enantiomer are presented in Table 8.

Glycopyrrolate (BS001265-58)
The binding of glycopyrrolate to plasma proteins in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human plasma was 
determined using equilibrium dialysis (BS001265-58). The results over the concentration range 0.2 to 500 
nmol/L are summarised in terms of the percentage free (unbound) glycopyrrolate in Table 9. The recovery of 
glycopyrrolate in the rabbit plasma protein binding experiment using equilibrium dialysis methodology was 
relatively low (~50%) and the plasma protein binding of glycopyrrolate in the rabbit was therefore 
determined again by ultrafiltration at 2, 50 and 500 nmol/L. The percentage unbound drug in rabbit plasma 
was considered more accurate when determined using ultrafiltration methodology as the percentage unbound 
determined using equilibrium dialysis methodology is affected by the stability issue in rabbit plasma. Thus, 
only results from the ultrafiltration experiments are presented for rabbit plasma. In the mouse, rat, rabbit, 
dog and human, the percentage unbound drug was not concentration dependent over the range 2 to 500 
nmol/L.

Tissue distribution
Glycopyrrolate: Quantitively whole body autoradiography (QWBA) in rats
Following intravenous administration of 14C-glycopyrrolate (4 mg/kg) to male pigmented rats, radioactivity 
was detectable in the majority of tissues through 4 hours post dose with Cmax generally occurring at 0.25 
hours post dose. The highest concentrations were observed in liver, kidneys, and small intestine. By 168 
hours post dose, all tissues were BLQ or not detectable, with exception of uveal tract, brown fat, and liver. 
The longest half-lives were calculated in the uveal tract, liver, and pigmented skin. After an oral 
administration of 14C-glycopyrrolate, limited distribution of drug-related radioactivity occurred. Cmax 
generally occurred at 1-hour post dose and by 72 hours all tissues were BLQ or not detectable, with 
exception of liver. The highest concentrations were observed in liver, stomach, small intestine, esophagus, 
kidney, and cecum. Radioactivity was not observed in uveal tract or pigmented skin. The longest half-life was 
calculated in the liver. While distribution of radioactivity into tissues was comparable following and 
intravenous and oral administration of14C-glycopyrrolate (30 mg/kg) the concentrations were lower after an 
oral administration and indicated limited exposure. 
In the same study, 14C-glycopyrrolate was also given to a limited number of albino male and female rats and, 
based on the limited time points there did not appear to be any difference in the distribution between the 
genders for either dose route. Following an intravenous administration radioactivity was detectable in tissues 
at 24 hours post dose, with the notable exception of the brain and eye tissues. By 168 hours post dose, only 
the liver had quantifiable levels. comparison of the radioactivity concentrations in the eye (by liquid 
scintillation counting) following an intravenous or oral administration of 14C-glycopyrrolate showed that 
concentrations for pigmented rats were greater than that of the albino rats. After an intravenous dose, 
analysis by QWBA showed the radioactivity in the uveal tract and pigmented skin persisted through 168 and 
72 hours, respectively, and half-lives calculated were long. These data indicated some limited binding of 
drug-related radioactivity to melanin-containing tissues had occurred.

Metabolism
No metabolism studies have been performed with the combination of budesonide, formoterol and 
glycopyrrolate. The metabolism of the active components budesonide and formoterol fumarate have been 
investigated by AstraZeneca to support earlier submissions and is only briefly repeated here for reference. 
Studies recently conducted by AstraZeneca on glycopyrrolate metabolism are presented below.
In vitro metabolism including P450 studies (phenotyping)
Budesonide
The metabolism of budesonide has been investigated in numerous studies and it is clear that budesonide can 
be regarded as a high clearance compound. Thus, the elimination of budesonide is solely dependent on 
metabolic clearance and in vitro studies with human liver homogenates have shown that budesonide is 
rapidly and extensively metabolised. Two major metabolites formed via CYP3A4 catalyzed biotransformation 
have been isolated and identified as 16α-hydroxyprednisolone and 6β-hydroxybudesonide. The corticosteroid 
activity of each of these metabolites is less than 1% of that of the parent compound. No qualitative 
differences between the in vitro and in vivo metabolic patterns have been detected. Negligible metabolic 
inactivation was observed in human lung and serum preparations (Jonsson G 1995; Andersson 1984).
Formoterol
The biotransformation of RR- and SS-formoterol has been studied in liver microsomes from mouse, rat, 
rabbit, dog and man (843-RD-0360, 843-RD-0370). Within each species, the same metabolite profile was 
obtained for RR- and SS-formoterol and the main metabolites were formoterol glucuronide and O-
demethylated formoterol whereas glucuronides of the O-demethylated metabolite and hydrolysis of 
formoterol were notable in some species. In addition, the biotransformation of RR- and SS-formoterol and 
the effect of formoterol on CYP enzymes were determined (843-RD-0395). The results on the 
biotransformation of formoterol indicated that the CYP enzymes most likely involved in O-demethylation of 
formoterol are CYP2D6 and CYP2C. Possible interaction of formoterol with other substrates metabolised by 
CYP enzymes was also studied. Results indicated that drug-drug interactions do not seem likely except 
possibly for CYP2D6; however, low concentrations of formoterol with therapeutic dosing makes any 
interaction unlikely.
Glycopyrrolate
The in vitro metabolism of glycopyrrolate has been studied in human, rat, dog, mouse and rabbit hepatocytes 
and in lung microsomes from human, rat and dog with 14C-glycopyrrolate (BE0011294-70). The turnover was 
low in human and dog hepatocytes with 90-95% remaining as unchanged 14C-glycopyrrolate and higher in 
rat, rabbit and mouse. The major metabolic pathways of 14C-glycopyrrolate in most species were 
monooxygenation, dioxygenation and monooxygenation in combination with desaturation. The proposed 
predominant metabolic positions are in the aromatic and cyclopentane ring moieties. No turnover in either 
human, rat or dog lung microsomes was observed. In addition, the metabolism of glycopyrrolate in human 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms was investigated by incubation with cell lines expressing individual human 
CYP isoforms (BS001884-09). CYP2D6 was found to be the predominant CYP isoform involved in the 
metabolism of glycopyrrolate and CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were also involved to small 
extent in the metabolism of glycopyrrolate in vitro. CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 were not shown 
to metabolise glycopyrrolate in this system.
The in vivo metabolism of glycopyrrolate was studied using urine and plasma samples obtained from the 
QWBA study in rats following single intravenous and oral administration of 14C-glycopyrrolate to (BE002211-

07). In total nineteen metabolites were detected (M1-M8, M11-M13, M15-M22), and molecular mass could be 
assigned to seventeen of these metabolites. Proposed metabolic scheme of glycopyrrolate detected in rat 
urine and plasma is shown in Figure 14.
Figure 4: Proposed metabolite scheme of glycopyrrolate and metabolites detected in rat urine and 
plasma
Following intravenous administration, 31% of the given dose was recovered as unchanged glycopyrrolate in 
urine up to 24 h while metabolites M21 and M22 (glucuronides of M15 [the acid formed by hydrolysis of 
glycopyrrolate]) accounted for the majority of the radioactivity excreted in urine after oral administration. 
The metabolic profile in male rat plasma following intravenous and oral administration is presented in Table 
10. Glycopyrrolate accounted for the majority of radioactivity after intravenous administration while 
metabolite M15 (the acid formed by hydrolysis of glycopyrrolate) was the major metabolite after oral 
administration.

Excretion
No excretion studies have been conducted on the fixed dose triple combination. Budesonide and formoterol 
have been investigated by AstraZeneca and data included in previous submissions for these compounds, and 
are not repeated here. In the QWBA study with 14C-glycopyrrolate, urine was collected up to 48 hours and 
excreted radioactivity was measured (8370562). Approximately 60% and 7.5% of the administered dose was 
recovered in urine after an intravenous and oral administration, respectively. The majority of the radioactivity 
in urine was recovered over the first 24 hours post dose. There did not appear to be any difference in the 
rate of excretion between the genders.

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions
No studies have been conducted on the fixed dose triple combination. AstraZeneca has recently conducted a 
number of in vitro studies to assess the potential of glycopyrrolate to inhibit CYP enzymes and for being a 
substrate and/or inhibitor of transporters which is newly reported here. Also see Module 2.6.5.12 and 
2.6.5.15. A recent publication concerning the effect of budesonide on CYP enzymes and transporters is 
summarised. The potential of formoterol to cause any interactions with CYP is regarded low.
Budesonide
Data regarding the potential for budesonide to be involved in drug-drug interactions involving CYP enzymes 
and transporters is available in published literature (Chen N 2018). The results indicated that budesonide is a 
substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) but not of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), 
and less than 50% inhibition of Pgp and BCRP was observed at 2 μM of budesonide resulting in extrapolated 
IC50 values >2 μM. Additionally, no inhibition of any of the uptake transporters evaluated was observed in 
the presence of budesonide i.e. 1.1 μM for the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and 
OATP1B3; 0.03 μM for the organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, and organic cation transporter (OCT)2. 
The extrapolated IC50 values were therefore >1.1 μM for OATP 1B1 and OATP1B3 and >0.03 μM for OAT1, 
OAT3, and OCT2.The potential for budesonide to inhibit CYP enzymes in human liver microsomes was also 
tested in a concentration range up to 10 μM. The IC50 was >10 μM for CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8,2C9, 2C19 and 
2D6. For CYP3A, the IC50 value was 4.7 μM with midazolam as the probe and>10 μM with testosterone as 
the probe, which is not of concern considering peak budesonide concentrations following inhalation of 
therapeutic doses are in the low nanomole range. In addition, the results indicated that budesonide is not a 
time-dependent inhibitor of any of the CYPs tested. The potential for induction of CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 was 
examined in human hepatocytes and the results suggested that although there was some modest induction of 
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression for CYP2B6 and 3A4, there was no increase in enzyme 
activity, and budesonide was considered to have low potential to cause drug-drug interaction (DDI) through 
induction of CYP enzymes.
Glycopyrrolate 
CYP studies 
The potential of glycopyrrolate to act as a reversible inhibitor of human CYP was investigated by co-
incubation of glycopyrrolate at six concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 μmol/L) with metabolically 
competent pooled human liver microsomes (HLM) in the presence of CYP specific substrates and NADPH. The 
rate of formation of metabolites for the CYP-selective substrates was measured using substrate 
concentrations equivalent to the Km values. The potential of glycopyrrolate to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 was assessed using the following marker substrates in a single cocktail: 
phenacetin (CYP1A2), diclofenac (CYP2C9), S-mephenytoin (CYP2C19), bufuralol (CYP2D6) and midazolam 
(CYP3A4/5). The potential of glycopyrrolate to inhibit CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 was 
assessed using the following marker substrates in a single cocktail: coumarin (CYP2A6), bupropion (CYP2B6), 
amodiaquine (CYP2C8), chlozoxazone (CYP2E1) and nifedipine (CYP3A4/5). There was no evidence that 
glycopyrrolate inhibited any of the tested CYPs over the concentration range tested (0.1-30 μmol/L) 
indicating little likelihood of any clinically important CYP inhibition. In addition, the potential for time 
dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 was investigated at two 
glycopyrrolate concentrations (0.1 and 1 μmol/L) with HLM (BS002367-13). No time dependent inhibition was 
observed. The in vitro potential of glycopyrrolate to induce CYP 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 has been evaluated in 
human hepatocytes. Induction was measured by changes in CYP mRNA expression after48 hours exposure to

glycopyrrolate (0.206-50 nmol/L) and assessed following selective enzyme activity forCYP1A2 (phenacetin O-
deethylation), CYP2B6 (bupropionhydroxylation) and CYP3A4 (midazolam 1-hydroxylation). Glycopyrrolate 
demonstrated no induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA expression or enzyme activity.
Transporter studies
Hepatic transporters: The in vitro potential of glycopyrrolate to induce CYP 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 has been 
evaluated in human hepatocytes. Induction was measured by changes in CYP mRNA expression after 48 
hours exposure to glycopyrrolate (0.206-50 nmol/L) and assessed following selective enzyme activity for 
CYP1A2 (phenacetin O-deethylation), CYP2B6 (bupropion hydroxylation) and CYP3A4 (midazolam 1-
hydroxylation). Glycopyrrolate demonstrated no induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA expression 
or enzyme activity.
Renal transporters: The potential for glycopyrrolate to inhibit the human renal transporters OCT2, OAT1, 
OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2K was evaluated in the concentration range 0.3 to 100 μmol/L (16AZTrP2R2). 
Glycopyrrolate did not inhibit OAT1 or OAT3. Max inhibition for OCT2 and MATE1 were approximately 60% at 
the highest concentration tested (100 μmol/L). Glycopyrrolate inhibited MATE2K in a concentration-
dependent manner but the inhibition at the highest test concentrations was less than 50%.
Efflux transporters: The potential of glycopyrrolate to act as an inhibitor of the human efflux transporters P-
gp (MDR1, ABCB1) and BCRP (ABCG2) were evaluated in the concentration range 1 to 300 μmol/L 
(BS001265-54 and BS001265-55). Glycopyrrolate did not inhibit transport via human P-gp or BCRP over the 
concentration range tested.
Substrate studies:
Uptake transporters: To evaluate the in vitro substrate potential of glycopyrrolate for uptake transporters 
(OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K), the influx rate ratios of glycopyrrolate (0.1 to 100 μmol/L). 
When the influx rate ratio was greater than 2, the transporter mediated uptake of glycopyrrolate was 
confirmed by inhibition by a known inhibitor (16AZTrP2R2). The influx rate ratios of glycopyrrolate for OAT1 
and OAT3 were less than 2.0, indicating that glycopyrrolate is not a substrate of these transporters. The 
influx rate ratios of glycopyrrolate for OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K were higher than 2.0, and the influx 
rates were markedly inhibited by known inhibitors. Therefore, it was concluded that glycopyrrolate is a 
substrate of OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K.
Efflux transporters: To evaluate the substrate potential of glycopyrrolate for efflux transporters P-gp and 
BCRP, Papp[A-B] (apical to basal) and Papp[B-A] (basal to apical) were evaluated in the concentration range 
0.1 to 100 μmol/L and the efflux ratio was determined in transfected cells and nontransfected cells 
(16AZTrP2R2). The relative efflux ratios of glycopyrrolate were lower than 2.0 between MDR1-MDCK and 
MDCK cells as well as between BCRP-MDCK and MDCK cells indicating that glycopyrrolate is not a substrate 
either P-gp or BCRP.
Uptake into human hepatocytes: The potential of glycopyrrolate was assessed to be a substrate for liver 
uptake transporters OATP1B1/1B3 by in vitro study using human hepatocytes (BS000901-62). Glycopyrrolate 
and human hepatocytes were incubated in absence and presence of OATPs inhibitors (Rifamycin SV). Uptake 
of glycopyrrolate into hepatocytes reduced 26% in presence of Rifamycin SV. This result suggested that 
glycopyrrolate is a weak substrate for hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1/1B3.

Toxicokinetics in reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with GP
Fertility/reproductive performance in rats
TK studies were conducted in mice for each individual component however there are no studies on the fixed 
dose combination BGF MDI. Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were not performed using the 
triple combination. Reproductive toxicity studies with GP administered by subcutaneous injection were 
performed (4 studies). TK parameters were not assessed in these studies due to limited animal number. 
Blood samples for TK were collected prior to and 0.5, 1, 2, 4 hours following the first and last doses prior to 
mating (for males this corresponded to study Days 1 and 28 ±2, while for females it corresponded to study 
Day 1 and 14 of the premating period). Plasma samples were analysed for glycopyrrolate concentrations 
using a validated bioanalytical method (VP16-137). Systemic exposure was confirmed in the treated male 
and female TK rats. Trace levels were noted in the control samples (excluding Day 1 males), these were 
considered contamination of unknown origin and do not represent true exposure since the levels are 
approximately 8-10 times lower than the maximum observed levels in the low dose treated animals. The 
plasma results indicated that Cmax was typically observed in the first sample, 0.5 hr post dose 
administration. No definitive sex differences were noted on Day 1.
A clear dose response was noted in the observational Cmax and proof of absorption across all treated groups 
for both sexes with dose proportionality was demonstrated by the concentrations observed in the plasma. 
Minimal to no accumulation of glycopyrrolate is estimated based on comparative plasma concentrations.
Embryo-fetal development in rats
Blood samples were taken on gestation Day 6 and 17 (prior to and 0.5, 1, 2, 4 hours after dose 
administration) and plasma samples were analysed for glycopyrrolate concentrations using a validated 
bioanalytical method (VP16-137) and an observational summary report was generated from the bioanalytical 
results. The plasma concentrations indicated that tmax was reached at 0.5 hr (low and mid dose groups) or 
up to 2 hrs (high dose group) post dosing. Observational Cmax for the low, mid and high dose groups on Day 
6 was 19.0, 211 and 1190 ng/mL, respectively. Observational Cmax for the low, mid and high dose groups 
on Day 17 was 20.3, 220 and 2050 ng/mL, respectively. Possible accumulation in the plasma was observed 
by comparing Day 6 vs Day 17 results in the high dose group; i.e. the Cmax at Day 17 was greater than 
Cmax at Day 6. Proof of absorption across all treated groups and dose proportionality was demonstrated. No 
glycopyrrolate was detected in the control samples.
Peri- and post-natal development in rats
Blood samples were taken from the dams and offspring on Day 4 at 0.5 and 1 hr after dose administration 
and plasma samples were analysed for glycopyrrolate concentrations using a validated bioanalytical method 
(VP17-080). The maternal plasma results indicated a tmax at 0.5 hr with an observational Cmax of 11.3, 158 
and 1610 ng/mL for the low, mid, and high dose groups, respectively. While, samples collected from the 
offspring (pooled samples from littermates/pups) indicated a tmax at either 1 hr for the low and high or 0.5 
hr for the mid dose group. The Cmax for the pooled offspring samples was 2.5, 12.1 and 96.0 ng/mL for the 
low, mid and high dose groups, respectively. Levels seen in the offspring indicate limited exposure via the 
milk during the lactation period. Proof of absorption across all dosed groups and dose proportionality was 
demonstrated in both the dam and offspring. Trace levels were noted in the control litter samples and in one 
control dam at a single point, these were considered contamination of unknown origin and do not represent

true exposure since the levels are approximately 8-10 times lower than levels observed in the low dose 
treated rats.
Embyro-fetal development rabbits
No formal toxicokinetic evaluation was performed in this study due to the limited number of time points and 
group size. Observational Cmax for the low, mid and high dose groups on Day 6 was 43.9, 500 and 5680 
ng/mL, respectively. Observational Cmax for the low, mid and high dose groups on Day 18 was 45.2, 484 
and 6940 ng/mL, respectively. Proof of absorption across all treated groups and dose proportionality was 
demonstrated on gestation Day 6 and 18. Trace levels were noted in the control samples (2 samples on day 6 
and 1 sample on day 18), these were considered contamination of unknown origin and do not represent true 
exposure since the levels are approximately 8-10 times lower than the maximum observed levels in the low 
dose treated rabbits.
2.3.4.  Toxicology
The inhaled fixed dose triple combination of budesonide, glycopyrrolate (glycopyrronium bromide) and 
formoterol fumarate (BGF, also known as PT010), a glucocorticosteroid, M3 antagonist and β2-agonist, 
respectively, has been developed as an inhaled maintenance therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), in a pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) formulation containing 1,2-distearoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), calcium chloride (CaCl2) and hydrofluoroalkane 134a (HFA-134a). Since 
each of the active components has been extensively investigated, and are available in marketed products, a 
limited package of studies has been conducted with the fixed dose combination, consisting of single dose MTD 
(non-GLP) and 14-day inhalation toxicity studies in rats and dogs, and a 3-month inhalation toxicity study in 
dogs (safety pharmacology data was generated as part of the toxicology studies, refer to Module 2.6.2). In 
addition, single dose MTD (non-GLP) and 14-day inhalation toxicity studies in rats and dogs, and 3-month 
inhalation toxicity studies in dogs were conducted for budesonide (BD), formoterol fumarate (FF) and 
glycopyrrolate (GP) individually and also for dual combinations: budesonide/formoterol (BFF), 
budesonide/glycopyrrolate (BGP) and glycopyrrolate/formoterol (GFF). Further, 6-month studies in rat and 
dog and carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were conducted for GP only. All the above studies were 
conducted using similar pMDI formulations containing DSPC, CaCl2 and HFA-134a and included vehicle and 
air control groups, thus these studies are also included in this submission, in brief, providing extensive data 
to support the safety of the active compounds and excipients.

Repeat dose toxicity
The repeat dose toxicity of the fixed dose combination of budesonide, glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate 
has been evaluated in inhalation studies of 14-days duration in rat and dog, and 3-months duration in dog. 
The 14-day studies included an assessment of reversibility 14 days after cessation of dosing at the highest 
dose level. Exposure data for budesonide, glycopyrrolate and formoterol from these studies is presented in 
Module 2.6.4. In addition, inhalation studies of 14 days duration in rat and dog, and 3 months duration in dog 
are presented for budesonide, formoterol fumarate and glycopyrrolate individually and also for dual 
combinations (budesonide/formoterol, budesonide/glycopyrrolate and glycopyrrolate/formoterol). Further, 6-
month studies in rat and dog were conducted for glycopyrrolate only. All of the above studies were conducted 
using a pMDI formulation containing DSPC, CaCl2 and HFA-134a and included vehicle and air control groups. 
BGF pMDI (FY14-033 (rat), FY14-036A (14 days, dog), FY14-148A (3 months, dog)
In a 14-day rat study, animals were dosed with low, mid and high doses of BGF or air and placebo control 
aerosols (see table, FY14-033). The mass median aerodynamic diameters (MMADs) of Placebo aerosol were 
4.3-4.6 μm (GSD 1.7 to 1.9). The MMADs of BGF aerosol were 4.4-4.6 μm (GSD 1.6). In 14-day and 3-

month dog studies, BGF and the dual combination BFF were assessed, with air and placebo aerosol control 
groups. 
In the 14-day dog study, animals were dosed with BGF, BFF or air and placebo aerosols. The dose range for 
BGF is listed in table below. The dose ranges for BFF (BD/FF, ug/kg/day) were low: 88.1/3.01(M), 
89.2/3.05(F); mid: 174/6.01(M), 176/6.07(F); high: 304/10.2 (M), 308/10.4(F).  The mass median 
aerodynamic diameters (MMADs) and geometric standard deviations (GSDs) were 4.19 to 4.52 (1.68 to 1.69) 
μm for BGF groups, 4.46 to 4.87 (1.61 to 1.99) μm for BFF groups, and 4.82 to 5.04 (1.59 to 1.71) μm for 
the placebo group. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed by inhalation to filtered air, placebo pMDIs, 
BGF or BFF pMDIs for up to 30 minutes per day for 14 consecutive days. Main study animals were assessed 
for general toxicity and euthanised on day 15 (see table, FY14-036A). Recovery animals were euthanised 
after the 14-day recovery period (on Day 29) for assessment of recovery from general toxicity. The toxicities 
observed in BGF-treated animals is detailed in the table below. 
To summarise, exposure to inhaled BGF or BFF in dogs for 14 days resulted in corroborative changes in 
clinical pathology, organ weights, and histopathology that were characteristic responses to corticosteroids. 
The ‘stress’ leukogram, e.g. increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes in the circulation was a typical 
finding following exposure to budesonide. Changes in white blood cell types with lower cell numbers, such as 
monocytes and eosinophils, showed higher variability. Organ weight changes were mainly reflected in 
decreases in adrenal glands and thymus weights, typical for corticosteroids, as well as increased liver weight 
which might be due to increased metabolic demand and/or altered fat/glucose metabolism. Consistent 
findings were observed from the microscopic examinations, including adrenal cortical atrophy, hepatocellular 
alteration, as well as hypocellularity in the cortex of thymus and lymph nodes. Reduced number of 
lymphocytes in both circulation and immune tissues was the result of immunosuppression from budesonide. 
The presence of glycopyrrolate and/or formoterol fumarate in the formulation did not seem to alter the 
overall expected pathological responses to budesonide. After a 14-day recovery period, some evidence of 
recovery was present in all affected tissues in most animals. Haematology, serum chemistry and most organ 
weight (except thymus) parameters had all returned to normal. Microscopically, the liver had returned to 
normal while adrenal and thymic changes were reduced, but persistent to some degree. Clinical observation 
mainly revealed liquid or soft stools after repeated exposures. No test article related changes were found in 
body weights, ophthalmology, ECG, or respiratory parameters. 
In the 3-month dog study, animals were dosed with BGF, BFF or air and placebo aerosols. The dose range for 
BGF is listed in table below. The dose ranges for BFF (BD/FF, ug/kg/day) were low: 3.02/0.10(M), 
3.16/0.11(F); mid: 13.48/0.47(M), 14.08/0.49(F); high: 67.73/2.28 (M), 71.34/2.40(F). The mass median 
aerodynamic diameters (MMADs) and geometric standard deviations (GSDs) were 3.38 (1.77) μm for BGF 
groups, 3.69 (1.86) μm for BFF groups, and 3.19 (1.70) μm for the placebo group. In summary, exposure to 
inhaled BGF and BFF pMDIs in male or female beagle dogs via face mask inhalation for 90 consecutive days 
resulted in tissue responses in adrenal glands, liver, and thymus, consistent with the effects of 
corticosteroids. Such changes were usually corroborative across several different pathology endpoints (e.g. 
organ weights, clinical pathology and histopathology). No consistent evidence of gender disparity across 
pathology endpoints was present.  Respiratory tract effects were not seen in any dose group. Specific organ 
weight changes identified and attributed to exposure included decreased adrenal gland weights, increased 
liver weights and decreased thymus weights. The weight changes corresponded to histologic findings of 
adrenal cortical atrophy (zona fasciculata and zona reticularis), hepatocellular alteration consistent with 
glycogen accumulation and/or increased metabolic activity (an adaptive response), and thymic cortex 
lymphocyte decreases. Changes in clinical pathology parameters attributed to exposure included minor 
alterations in serum chemistry (minor increases in the liver enzymes alkaline phosphatase and gamma

glutamyl transferase, and minor albumin and triglyceride elevations). A clear NOAEL was not observed in this 
study. However overall the few low dose effects for both BGF and BFF were minimal in nature (minimal liver 
hepatocellular alteration in a minority of animals and minimal thymic cortical lymphocyte decreases). The 
changes in tissues and clinical pathology in this study were characteristic of the well described effects of 
corticosteroids and were likely in response to the budesonide component present in BGF and BFF. GLP-
compliant repeat-dose studies with BGF pMDI are detailed in Table 12.

Repeat-dose toxicity of individual components
Budesonide (FY14-035 (rat), FY14-036B (dog 14-day), FY14-148B (dog 3-month))
In the 14-day rat study, groups of 10 main study animals per sex/group (plus recovery and toxicokinetic 
animals) were dosed by nose only inhalation at 713, 2270 and 4550 μg/kg/day, with similar sized air and 
placebo control groups. This resulted in body weight loss, mortality/morbidity (most probably due to systemic 
bacterial infection resulting from the immunosuppressive effects of budesonide) and consistent tissue 
responses in larynx, lung, adrenal glands, liver, stomach and lymphoid tissues (including the thymus, spleen, 
lymph nodes and bone marrow). The non-respiratory responses were characteristic of the effects of 
corticosteroids. Corroborative changes were typically present in organ weights, as well as in haematology and 
serum chemistry parameters. After a 14-day recovery period, evidence of complete or partial recovery was 
present in all affected parameters. Changes in tissues and clinical pathology in this study were characteristic 
of the well-described effects of corticosteroids, and were likely in response to budesonide. A NOAEL was not 
defined in this study. 
In a 14-day dog study evaluating BD pMDI and BGP pMDI, groups of 3 or 4 main study and 2 recovery 
animals per sex/group were dosed by face mask inhalation for up to 30 minutes per day for 14 days at 141, 
286 and 360 μg/kg/day (budesonide) or 169/9.3, 389/21 and 534/29 μg/kg/day 
(budesonide/glycopyrrolate), followed by a 14-day recovery period, with similar sized air and placebo control 
groups. The mass median aerodynamic diameters (MMADs) and geometric standard deviations (GSDs) were 
4.54-4.82 (1.57-1.62) μm for BD groups, 4.40-4.80 (1.71-1.75) μm for BGP groups, and 3.50-4.61 (1.60-
1.74) μm for the placebo group. Exposure to inhaled BD or BGP pMDI in dogs via face mask for 14 days 
resulted inconsistent responses in clinical pathology, organ weights, and histopathology that were 
characteristic of corticosteroids effects. One BGP high dose male animal was euthanised moribund on Day 7, 
with findings (widespread neutrophilic and histiocytic pulmonary inflammation) consistent with opportunistic 
infection likely resulting from the immunosuppressive effects of budesonide. Changes in haematology 
demonstrated a typical ‘stress’ leukogram following exposure to budesonide, including increased neutrophils 
and monocytes as well as reduced lymphocytes and eosinophils in the circulation. Clinical chemistry analyses 
primarily revealed increases in ALP and GGT, parameters related to liver function and fat metabolism. Organ 
weight changes were mainly reflected in a decrease in adrenal gland and thymus weights, as well as an 
increase in the liver weight. Although a consistent dose response was not always evident, these are all 
expected responses to corticosteroids. Consistent findings were observed from the microscopic examinations, 
including atrophy of the adrenal cortex (zona fasciculata and zona reticularis) and decreased thymic cortical 
lymphocytes in all the BD or BGP treated animals, decreases of cortical lymphocytes in the tracheobronchial 
lymph node to variable degrees among groups, and hepatocellular alteration in periportal regions of the liver. 
After the 14-day recovery period, some evidence of recovery was present, but no group showed complete 
recovery in all parameters. No overt test article related changes were found in other study endpoints 
including body weights, ophthalmology, ECG, or respiratory parameters. Overall, the findings demonstrated 
in this study were typical responses to corticosteroids, hence attributed to budesonide. Addition of 
glycopyrrolate to the formulation did not change the severity of effects compared to that from BD exposure 
alone. No apparent gender difference was observed in this study. In conclusion, a NOAEL was not defined in 
this study for either BD or BGP pMDI.
In a 3-month study evaluating BD pMDI and BGP pMDI, groups of 4 main study animals per sex/group were 
dosed by face mask inhalation for 90 days at 3.4, 31 and 104 μg/kg/day (budesonide) or 3.6/0.21, 31/1.7 
and 98/5.4 μg/kg/day(budesonide/glycopyrrolate), with similar sized air and placebo control groups. The 
MMADs and geometric standard deviations (GSDs) were 3.54 (1.69) μm for BD groups, 3.39 (1.75) μm for

BGP groups, and 3.59 (1.80) μm for the placebo group. Exposure to inhaled BGP and BD pMDIs in male or 
female beagle dogs via face mask inhalation for 90 consecutive days resulted in tissue responses in adrenal 
glands, liver, and thymus, consistent with the effects of corticosteroids. Corroborative changes were present 
in organ weights, and to a limited degree in some haematology and serum chemistry parameters. Respiratory 
tract effects were not seen in any dose group. Specific organ weight changes identified and attributed to 
exposure included decreased adrenal gland weights, increased liver weights and decreased thymus weights. 
The weight changes corresponded to histologic findings of adrenal cortical atrophy (zona fasciculata and zona 
reticularis), hepatocellular alteration consistent with glycogen accumulation and/or increased metabolic 
activity (an adaptive response), and thymic cortex lymphocyte decreases. Changes in clinical pathology 
parameters attributed to exposure included minor decreases in eosinophil counts and minor alterations in 
serum chemistry (minor albumin and triglyceride elevations). A clear NOEL was not observed in this study. 
However, overall the few low dose effects for both BGP and BD were minimal in nature (minimal liver 
hepatocellular alteration and minimal to mild thymic cortical lymphocyte decreases) and can be considered a 
NOAEL. The changes in tissues and clinical pathology in this study were characteristic of the well described 
effects of corticosteroids, and were likely in response to the budesonide component present in both test 
article formulations. 
Formoterol (FY09-039 (rat), FY09-038 (dog))
In the 14-day rat study, groups 10 main study animals per sex/group (plus recovery and toxicokinetic 
animals) were dosed by nose only inhalation at 36, 91 and 158 μg/kg/day, with similar sized air and placebo 
control groups. This resulted in minor changes in haematology and clinical chemistry parameters that 
generally returned to baseline with the 14-day recovery period. These changes were likely not toxicological 
due to the lack of correlating histopathology findings or changes in various other supporting clinical chemistry 
parameters. There were no histopathological findings in any dose groups. The NOAEL was considered to be 
the high dose group of 158 μg/kg/day. In the 14-day dog study, groups of 4 main study animals (plus 2 
recovery animals) per sex/group were dosed by face mask inhalation at 9.2, 13 and 24 μg/kg/day 
(formoterol fumarate), with similar sized air and placebo control groups. The dogs showed changes in cardiac 
parameters and clinical observations, such as increased heart rate (HR), consistent with the previously 
reported effects of formoterol fumarate. Minimal to moderate fibrosis associated with the papillary muscle of 
the left ventricle was observed in the mid and high dose group animals. One animal in the low dose group 
had spindle shaped cells associated with the papillary muscle. Similar observations (graded as slight) were 
still present in the recovery group of the high dose animals. Collagen associated with this region was 
presumably due to the destruction of cardiomyocytes as a result of the sustained elevated HR and 
subsequent ischemia. As expected, hepatocellular vacuolisation was observed in all dose groups. The 
incidence and severity of these changes was approximately the same across all exposed groups. In the main 
study, no significant changes in haematology or clinical chemistry parameters were observed with formoterol 
fumarate compared to the placebo control group. Spurious changes were reported during the recovery period 
that were not supported by any other parameters. In the absence of other related effects, the biological 
significance of these is considered minor. Due to an outlier animal in the low dose group, a clear NOAEL was 
not observed in this study. However, considering that this single low dose animal displayed an extended 
plasma formoterol T1/2 of 9.3 h on Day 1 compared to an average T1/2 of 2.4 h for all other low dose 
animals, it is likely that this was the cause of the minimal cardiac finding (i.e. spindle shaped cells) in this 
animal, therefore the NOAEL might reasonably be considered to be the low dose of 9.2 μg/kg/day. The 
cardiac findings were considered to be the result of large increases in HR during each dosing session (a 
known effect of β2-agonists), for which dogs are known to be particularly sensitive. Further evaluation of

formoterol fumarate was conducted in a 3-month study with GFF (FY10-129; see section ‘RD toxicity of dual 
combinations’ > ‘GFF’).
Glycopyrrolate 
Rat (FY08-076 (14 days), FY10-120 (6 months) 
In the 14-day rat study, groups of 8 or 10 main study animals per sex/group (plus recovery and toxicokinetic 
animals) were dosed by nose only inhalation at 48, 265 and 535 μg/kg/day, with similar sized air and placebo 
control groups. There were no significant findings and the NOAEL was considered to be the high dose group 
of 535 μg/kg/day (combined male and female average). In the 6-month rat study, groups of 15+15 animals 
were dosed by nose only inhalation at 68, 275 and 548 μg/kg/day, with similar sized air and placebo control 
groups. Exposure of the animals was confirmed by plasma analysis at the last day of exposure, 30 minutes 
post-dose. There was no measurable test article in samples from the placebo or air control groups. No 
treatment-related effects were observed on survival, clinical observations, ophthalmic examinations, or body 
weights. There were considered to be no test article related effects of significance in haematology, clinical 
chemistry or urinalysis parameters. There was a dose dependent increased incidence in minimal laryngeal 
metaplasia among the placebo and test article exposed animals relative to air controls, and minimal hyaline 
degeneration in the nasal turbinates of all groups, including the controls. Minimal macrophage accumulation 
in the lungs was observed in all groups, including the air and placebo controls with no significant increase in 
severity or incidence in the test article exposed groups. These findings are considered to be minor, adaptive 
responses commonly observed in rodent inhalation studies. There were no significant test article gross 
pathology or histopathological findings present inany non-respiratory tissue. There were no pre-neoplastic or 
neoplastic findings in any test article exposed group. The NOAEL was considered to be the high dose group 
(i.e., the maximum feasible dose) of 548 μg/kg/day. 
Dogs (FY08-077 (14 days), FY10-129 (3 months), FY12-073 (6 months))
In the 14-day dog study, groups of 3 or 4 main study animals (plus 2 recovery animals) persex/group were 
dosed by face mask inhalation at 17, 30 and 80 μg/kg/day (glycopyrrolate), with similar sized air and placebo 
control groups. There were no significant findings and the NOAEL was considered to be the high dose group 
of 80 μg/kg/day. Glycopyrrolate was also evaluated in a 3-month study alongside GFF dual combination 
FY10-129; see section ‘RD toxicity of dual combinations’ > ‘GFF’). In a 6-month dog study, groups of 4 main 
study animals per sex/group were dosed by facemask inhalation at 19, 58 and 75 μg/kg/day 
(glycopyrrolate), with similar sized air and placebo control groups. Study endpoints included clinical 
observations, body weights, clinical pathology, ophthalmology, electrocardiography, pulmonary physiology, 
toxicokinetic analysis, organ weights, urinalysis, and histopathology. Particle sizes of test article pMDI 
aerosols, expressed as MMAD and GSD, averaged 3.74 (1.78) μm for glycopyrrolate and 4.23 (1.82) μm for 
the placebo group. There were no consistent findings indicating any significant effect of treatment with 
glycopyrrolate. There were no significant differences between the filtered air controls and the placebo control 
group. The NOAEL was considered to be the high dose group of 75 μg/kg/day combined male and female 
average).
Repeat-dose toxicity of dual combinations
BFF (FY14-034 (rat), FY14-036A (dog 14-day), FY14-148A (dog 3-month))
In the 14-day rat study, groups of 10 main study animals per sex/group (plus recovery and toxicokinetic 
animals) were dosed by nose only inhalation at 465/14, 1540/45 and 3160/93 μg/kg/day 
(budesonide/formoterol fumarate), with similar sized air and placebo control groups. This resulted in

histopathological changes in larynx, lung, adrenal glands, liver, stomach and lymphoid tissues (including the 
thymus, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow). The non-respiratory responses were characteristic of the 
effects of corticosteroids. Corroborative changes were present in organ weights, as well as in haematology 
and serum chemistry parameters. Changes within the respiratory tract were minimal and considered 
nonspecific effects. Body weight reduction occurred in a dose responsive fashion. Early removal occurred in 
the low dose (1F) and high dose (1M 3F) groups, most probably due to systemic bacterial infection resulting 
from the immunosuppressive effects of budesonide. Evidence of complete or partial recovery was present in 
all affected parameters. Changes in tissues and clinical pathology in this study were characteristic of the well-
described effects of corticosteroids, and were likely in response to the budesonide component present in the 
BFF combination test article. A NOAEL was not identified in the study. 
BFF was also evaluated in 14-day (FY14-036A) and 3-month (FY14-048A) studies with BGF in the beagle dog. 
Groups of 3 or 4 dogs (main study) and 2 dogs (recovery) per sex/group were dosed by facemask inhalation 
for 14 days, followed by a 14 day recovery period, at 132/6.7/4.2, 260/13/8.5and 428/22/14 μg/kg/day 
(budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol) or 89/3.0, 175/6.0 and306/10 μg/kg/day (budesonide/formoterol), 
with similar sized air and placebo control groups. The MMADs and GSDs were 4.19 to 4.52 (1.68 to 1.69) μm 
for BGF groups, 4.46 to 4.87 (1.61 to 1.99) μm for BFF groups, and 4.82 to 5.04 (1.59 to 1.71) μm for the 
placebo group. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed by inhalation to filtered air, placebo pMDIs, BGFor 
BFF pMDIs for up to 30 minutes per day for 14 consecutive days. There was no instance of morbidity or 
mortality resulting from exposure to any of the test article or Placebo pMDIs, and all animals survived to the 
scheduled necropsy. Exposure to inhaled BGF or BFF in dogs for 14 days resulted in corroborative changes in 
clinical pathology, organ weights, and histopathology that were characteristic responses to corticosteroids. 
The ‘stress’ leukogram, e.g. increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes in the circulation was a typical 
finding following exposure to budesonide. Changes in white blood cell types with lower cell numbers, such as 
monocytes and eosinophils, showed higher variability. Organ weight changes were mainly reflected in 
decreases in adrenal glands and thymus weights, typical for corticosteroids, as well as increased liver weight 
which might be due to increased metabolic demand and/or altered fat/glucose metabolism. Consistent 
findings were observed from the microscopic examinations, including adrenal cortical atrophy, hepatocellular 
alteration, as well as hypocellularity in the cortex of thymus and lymph nodes. Reduced number of 
lymphocytes in both circulation and immune tissues was the result of immunosuppression from budesonide. 
The presence of glycopyrrolate and/or formoterol fumarate in the formulation did not seem to alter the 
overall expected pathological responses to budesonide. After a 14-day recovery period, some evidence of 
recovery was present in all affected tissues in most animals. Haematology, serum chemistry and most organ 
weight (except thymus) parameters had all returned to normal. Microscopically, the liver had returned to 
normal while adrenal and thymic changes were reduced, but persistent to some degree. Clinical observation 
mainly revealed liquid or soft stools after repeated exposures. No test article related changes were found in 
body weights, ophthalmology, ECG, or respiratory parameters. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) 
was not defined in this study for either BGF or BFF pMDI.
In the 3-month study beagle dog study, Groups of 4 main study animals per sex/group were dosed by face 
mask inhalation for 90 days at 3.3/0.21/0.11, 17/1.1/0.62 and 60/3.5/2.0 μg/kg/day 
(budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol) or 3.1/0.11, 14/0.48 and 70/2.3 μg/kg/day (budesonide/formoterol), 
with similar sized air and placebo control groups. The MMADs and GSDs were 3.38 (1.77) μm for BGF groups, 
3.69 (1.86) μm for BFF groups, and 3.19 (1.70) μm for the placebo group. Exposure to inhaled BGF and BFF 
pMDIs in male or female beagle dogs via facemask inhalation for 90 consecutive days resulted in tissue 
responses in adrenal glands, liver, and thymus, consistent with the effects of corticosteroids. Such changes 
were usually corroborative across several different pathology endpoints (e.g. organ weights, clinical

pathology and histopathology). No consistent evidence of gender disparity across pathology endpoints was 
present. Respiratory tract effects were not seen in any dose group. Specific organ weight changes identified 
and attributed to exposure included decreased adrenal gland weights, increased liver weights and decreased 
thymus weights. The weight changes corresponded to histologic findings of adrenal cortical atrophy (zona 
fasciculata and zona reticularis), hepatocellular alteration consistent with glycogen accumulation and/or 
increased metabolic activity (an adaptive response), and thymic cortex lymphocyte decreases. Changes in 
clinical pathology parameters attributed to exposure included minor alterations in serum chemistry (minor 
increases in the liver enzymes alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase, and minor albumin 
and triglyceride elevations). A clear NOAEL was not observed in this study. However overall the few low dose 
effects for both BGF and BFF were minimal in nature (minimal liver hepatocellular alteration in a minority of 
animals and minimal thymic cortical lymphocyte decreases). The changes in tissues and clinical pathology in 
this study were characteristic of the well described effects of corticosteroids, and were likely in response to 
the budesonide component present in BGF and BFF.
BGP (FY15-040 (rat), FY14-036B (dog 14-day), FY14-148B (dog 3-month)
In the 14-day rat study, groups of 10 main study animals per sex/group (plus recovery and toxicokinetic 
animals) were dosed by nose only inhalation at 641/34, 2190/118 and 4500/243 μg/kg/day 
(budesonide/glycopyrrolate), with similar sized air and placebo control groups. This resulted in findings 
attributable to the typical systemic effects of glucocorticoids. Mortality and/or morbidity occurred in the mid 
(2 found dead) and high dose groups (1 moribund and 3 found dead), most probably due to bacterial 
infections resulting from the budesonide related immunosuppression. All treated groups of both genders 
exhibited decreased body weight in a dose-dependent manner. Changes in the respiratory tract were 
minimal, including metaplasia of squamous epithelium in the larynx and accumulation of alveolar 
macrophages. The immunosuppressive effects of budesonide were demonstrated by the typical corticosteroid 
leukogram in clinical pathology, reduced organ weights of spleen/thymus/adrenal gland, and the 
corresponding histopathological changes such as atrophy of adrenal gland as well as hypocellularity in the 
immune system. Changes in metabolism after exposure were demonstrated by significant increases in 
triglycerides (TRIG) and glucose (GLU), as well as decreased potassium. Parameters of liver function, e.g. 
ALT and AST, were also increased in both genders of the high dose group and females from all dose levels. 
Consistently, hepatocellular lipidosis was observed in all three dose groups of the main study animals. In 
addition, a dose dependent response was observed in stomach ulceration across all three dose groups in the 
main study animals. Evidence of complete or partial recovery was present in all affected parameters. A 
NOAEL was not defined in this study. In 14-day and 3-month beagle dog studies, BGP pMDI was also 
evaluated (FY14-036B, FY14-148B; see previous section, ‘RD toxicity individual components’ > Budesonide’).
GFF (FY09-086 (rat), FY09-087 (dog 14-day), FY10-129 (dog 3-month))
In the 14-day rat study, groups of 10 main study animals per sex/group (plus recovery and toxicokinetic 
animals) were dosed by nose only inhalation at 74/15, 234/44 and 381/71μg/kg/day 
(glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate), with similar sized air and placebo control groups. This resulted in minor 
changes in some haematology and clinical chemistry parameters that generally returned to baseline with a 
14-day recovery period. These changes are likely not due to toxicity due to the lack of correlating 
histopathology findings or changes in various other supporting clinical chemistry parameters. The animals 
showed no histopathological findings in any dose group. Exposure was confirmed by the presence of 
glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate in all test article-treated animals, with no measurable test article in 
the placebo or control groups. The NOAEL of GFF MDI was considered to be the high dose group (i.e., the 
maximum feasible dose) of 381/71 μg/kg/day (glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate). In the 14-day dog 
Assessment report

study, groups of 4 main study animals (plus 2 recovery animals) per sex/group were dosed by face mask 
inhalation at 17/3.4, 52/8.9 and 75/13 g/kg/day (glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate), with similar sized air 
and placebo control groups. Exposure to inhaled glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate was confirmed by 
the presence of glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate in the plasma of all treated animals, with no 
measurable test article in the placebo or air control groups. As expected with formoterol fumarate, the dogs 
showed changes in cardiac parameters, respiratory parameters, and clinical observations consistent with 
formoterol symptoms and signs reported in the literature. Additionally, histopathological findings were 
considered a consequence of the sustained increased HR and adaptive metabolic activity in the liver 
characterised by swollen cytoplasm. Inhalation of glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate resulted in 
transient and biologically insignificant changes in various clinical chemistry and haematology parameters in 
the 14-day recovery group that returned to baseline during the recovery period. A clear NOAEL was not 
observed in this study if the liver swollen cytoplasm is considered an adverse finding. There were no signs of 
liver toxicity present such as liver enzyme changes. Therefore, considering the liver findings to be consistent 
with an adaptive response to increased metabolism and the fact that the liver alterations were a minor and 
reversible finding in all dose groups, the low dose group might reasonably be considered to be the NOAEL. 
The low dose NOAEL of glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate in both sexes was 17/3.4 µg/kg/day. There were 
no significant differences between the filtered air controls and the placebo control group.
GFF was also evaluated in a 3-month study with glycopyrrolate only and formoterol fumarate only in beagle 
dogs. Groups of 4 main study animals per sex/group were dosed by face mask inhalation for 90 days at 87 
μg/kg/day (glycopyrrolate) or 4.5, 10 and 14 μg/kg/day (formoterol fumarate), or 18/4.5, 43/10 and 61/14 
μg/kg/day (glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate), with similar sized air and placebo control groups. Study 
endpoints included clinical observations, body weights, clinical pathology, ophthalmology, organ weights, 
pulmonary physiology, cardiovascular physiology, and histopathology. Particle sizes of test article pMDI 
aerosols, expressed as MMAD and geometric standard deviation (GSD) averaged 3.90 (1.78) μm for the 
glycopyrrolate only group, 3.51 (1.68) μm for the formoterol fumarate only groups, 3.51 (1.98) μm for the 
combination groups, and 4.66 (1.82) μm for the placebo group. As expected, the dogs showed changes in 
cardiac (increased heart rate) parameters and associated clinical signs consistent with known β2 agonist 
effects. Additionally, histopathological findings in the liver (swollen cytoplasm) and increased liver weights 
were considered a consequence of adaptive metabolic activity in the liver, and also characteristic of β2 
agonists. Transient and biologically insignificant changes in various clinical chemistry and haematology 
parameters were also noted. The overall incidence of macrophage aggregates and related findings in the 
lung, although commonly seen on inhalation studies, was higher in the high formoterol and high combination 
groups compared with the rest of the exposed groups and controls. Since there were no supporting signs of 
liver toxicity present such as hepatic enzyme changes or cellular necrosis, the liver swollen cytoplasm can be 
considered an adaptive response rather than a toxic response, therefore the NOAEL was the mid dose group 
for the formoterol fumarate (10 μg/kg/day) and combination (43/10 μg/kg/day) groups. The high dose group 
(87 μg/kg/day) for the glycopyrrolate only animals was the NOAEL. There were no significant differences 
between the filtered air controls and the placebo control group.
Genotoxicity
No genotoxicity studies have been conducted with the combination of budesonide, formoterol fumarate and 
glycopyrrolate, since each active substance has been investigated individually. None of the compounds has 
demonstrated genotoxic potential, thus, the combination is not expected to pose a potential genotoxic risk. 
The genotoxicity data on the individual active substances have been previously submitted by AstraZeneca

Budesonide did not have a positive effect in any of the tests. Based on the results, budesonide is considered 
not genotoxic.  In the Ames bacterial reverse mutation test, two batches of formoterol (batch 1
00/91 and 131/90) were tested in two independent studies.  A weak but significant increase in the number of 
revertants was seen with both batches in one of the two experiments in each study However, since the 
effects were neither reproducible nor dose-related, it was concluded that formoterol was not mutagenic in the 
Ames test.  Formoterol was not mutagenic at the thymidine kinase locus in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, 
did not induce chromosome aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro and did not induce 
micronuclei formation in rats treated with formoterol by inhalation (estimated inhaled doses of 19.8 and 39.4 
mg/kg).  Based on these results, it is concluded that formoterol is not genotoxic. Glycopyrrolate did not have 
a positive effect in any of the tests. Based on the results, glycopyrrolate is considered not genotoxic. All 
genotoxicity studies were GLP-compliant. 
Carcinogenicity
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with the combination of budesonide, formoterol fumarate 
and glycopyrrolate, since each active substance has been investigated individually. None of the compounds 
has demonstrated carcinogenic potential besides the known class effects in animals. Thus, the combination is 
not expected to pose a potential carcinogenic risk. The carcinogenicity data on the individual active 
substances have been previously submitted by AstraZeneca and are included in this submission for reference. 
Long-term studies
Budesonide
Budesonide was tested for its carcinogenic potential in mice and rats administered budesonide in drinking 
water for up two years. The dose ranges for long-term studies were based on results from 3-month dose-
finding studies. Budesonide was weakly tumorigenic in the liver, a class effect of glucocorticoid drugs. A 
summary of the studies with budesonide is detailed in Table 16.

Formoterol fumarate
The carcinogenic potential of formoterol was assessed in 2-year studies in mice via the oral route 
(citrate/phosphate buffered saline) and in rats via inhalation (lactose powder mixture). The doses for 
carcinogenicity studies were selected based on the proposed human dose, the pharmacological effect and 
results from 3-month studies in the relevant species. carcinogenicity studies with formoterol in mice and rats 
revealed treatment related increase in uterine or mesovarian leiomyoma incidences, which are consistent 
with the known pharmacological effects of β2-agonists in rodents but have no clinical relevance. A summary 
of the studies with formoterol fumarate is detailed in Table 17.

Major findings
Survival was not affected and ranged from 
42% to 55% in the treated males (vs. 52% in 
control males), and from 33% to 45% in 
treated females (vs. 37% to 42% in control 
females). Body weight gains were significantly 
increased in the HD in both sexes while food 
consumption was increased in males only. 
Heart weight relative to brain weight was 
significantly increased in the HD males while a 
trend of reduced uterine weights was seen in 
females
A dose-related increase in the incidence of 
uterine leiomyomas as observed in all treated 
female groups. The incidences were 0 and 
6.7% in the two control groups, versus 
11.7%, 18.3% and 21.7%) in the low, mid 
and high dose, respectively. An increased 
incidence of haemangioma in females and 
hepatocellular tumours in males was 
observed.
Terminal survival was not affected by 
formoterol and ranged from 52% to 68% in 
treated males (vs. 56% to 58% in control 
males) and 60% to 70% in treated females 
(vs. 66% in control females). 
Electrocardiography recordings showed a 
rapid, dose-related tachycardia, which 
achieved maximum (up to 40%) at 10 min 
after exposure; the mean increases were 6%, 
25%, 26% in males and 7%, 14%, and 29% 
in females at low, mid and high dose, 
respectively.
Increases in absolute and relative heart 
weights were seen in the high dose animals 
and increases in relative heart weight were 
seen in mid-dose animals.  Microscopic 
examination of the heart revealed increased, 
but not dose-related, incidence in the treated 
groups of myonecrosis/ fibrosis.  
An incidence of mesovarian leiomyoma was 
noted in a high dose female (not statistically

significant, compared to zero incidence in the 
controls or the low and mid dose groups) was 
considered to be treatment-related. No other 
neoplastic effects were observed in the 
treated groups.
Glycopyrrolate
The carcinogenic potential of glycopyrrolate was assessed in studies of up to 2 years in mice and rats via 
inhalation (pMDI). The doses for the mouse carcinogenicity study were selected based on the proposed 
human dose, the pharmacological effect and the results from a 14-day study. The doses for the rat 
carcinogenicity study were selected based on previous studies indicating that a dose of around 600 μg/kg/day 
was the highest technically feasible dose with the available formulation, and would be well tolerated. In the 
mouse studies, tumour incidence was similar in glycopyrrolate and control groups and was therefore not 
carcinogenic at any dose level. In the rat study, chronic administration did not reveal carcinogenic potential. 
A summary of the studies with glycopyrrolate is detailed in Table 18.

Major findings
Overall mortality rate varied from 23% to 
37% across all study groups. Treatment-
related depression in body weight gain for 
the Mid and High dose groups, was 
observed relative to both control groups. 
No proliferative (i.e., hyperplastic, pre-
neoplastic, or neoplastic) changes that 
were associated with treatment with 
glycopyrrolate. Limited non-neoplastic 
effects within the nasal cavity and 
glandular stomach were considered to be 
test article related. In the nasal passages 
(Level I, II, III, IV), a dose-related 
increased incidence of hyaline degeneration 
of the respiratory and olfactory nasal 
epithelium was observed in all treated 
groups including placebo, indicating its 
relationship with the inhalation of 
exogenous material. Additional findings in 
the nasal cavity included an increased 
incidence of eosinophilic material in the 
nasal airway, and/or an increased incidence 
of acute inflammation.
In the non-respiratory tissues, an increased 
incidence of mucosal hyperplasia of the 
glandular stomach was observed in the 
treated male and female mice. Although 
not dose-related in incidence, it was 
generally higher in the test article treated 
groups compared to the air and
placebo controls.
Thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia and 
adenomas were noted in male and female
mice across all study groups including both 
air and placebo groups, at an unusually 
high incidence that was not treatment 
related.

EMA/582495/2020

Tumor incidence in males: 
increased tumour incidence of 
adenocarcinoma in the harderian glands
between the air and placebo control 
groups, systemic histiocytic sarcoma 
between the placebo control and the mid 
dose group, and adenoma, follicular cell in 
the thyroid glands compared to control 
groups. No dose-related trends were 
observed in the systemic histiocytic 
sarcoma or the adenoma, follicular cell in 
the thyroid glands. For the adenocarcinoma 
in the harderian gland, trend tests were 
statistically significant with the air control 
compared to all active treatment groups, 
however not compared to the placebo. In 
addition, this tumour is considered common 
and no pairwise comparisons were 
statistically significant.
Tumour incidence in females: Increased 
tumour incidence of adenoma in the 
duodenum compared to the control groups, 
alveolar-bronchial adenoma in the right 
lung between the low dose and the control 
groups and the high dose compared to both 
controls, adenocarcinoma in the mammary
gland compared to the control groups, 
fibrosarcoma in the skin between the low 
dose and the controls, and adenoma, 
follicular cell in the thyroid glands 
compared to the control groups.
Statistical significance was observed per 
the above groups, no dose related trends 
were noted.
The final survival numbers were: 38, 27, 
35, 35 and 38 for males, and 22, 26, 29, 
25 and 29 for females (air, placebo, low, 
mid, and high, respectively). Body weight 
gain was suppressed in all dose groups 
relative to control groups. No proliferative 
(i.e., hyperplastic, pre-neoplastic, or 
neoplastic) changes were observed. Limited 
non-neoplastic effects within the larynx and 
nose were associated with treatment. 
Within the larynx “metaplasia, squamous” 
increased in a dose responsive fashion. 
This is a common change in rat inhalation 
studies with a wide variety of test articles, 
and is considered an adaptive, non-adverse 
effect.  Changes in the nose/turbinates 
within the nasal cavity were limited to 
“degeneration, hyaline” in the epithelium of 
the caudal nose sections, and 
“inflammation, neutrophilic” in the rostral 
nose sections. A strong dose response was 
present for “degeneration, hyaline” (also

of the olfactory epithelium. This is a 
common incidental change in rats which 
normally increases with age in the caudal 
nasal sections (Renne, 2009). It also has 
been seen to increase in response to a wide 
variety of inert inhaled material in 
inhalation studies
(Harkema, 2006).
Statistical analysis was conducted for 
onset of tumour incidence within the 
study.  There were no statistical findings 
among males.  In females, there was 
increased tumour incidence of adenoma 
(mammary gland) between the air control 
and the low dose group and adenoma
(c-cell in the thyroid) between the placebo 
control and the mid dose group.  Both 
tumour types are considered common and 
no other pairwise comparisons were 
statistically significant (i.e. no statistically 
significant dose related trend for the 
tumours).
Reproduction Toxicity
No reproductive and development toxicity studies have been conducted with the combination of budesonide, 
formoterol fumarate and glycopyrrolate, since each active substance has been investigated individually. 
Each of the compounds has demonstrated some potential for effects on reproduction and development, but 
only at substantial multiples of the therapeutic dose/exposure.  Thus, the combination is not expected to 
pose a potential reproductive or developmental risk in therapeutic use. The reproductive and development 
toxicity data on the individual active substances have been previously submitted by AstraZeneca and are 
included in this submission for reference.

pregnancy duration in high dose 
females.
Reduced fetal and litter weights, 
slightly increased placental weight 
and incidence of fetal abnormalities 
observed in 15 mg/kg/day. At 3 
mg/kg/day, placental weight was 
slightly increased but the 
malformation rate was comparable 
to the controls. 
In dams allowed to deliver, litter 
size and weight were reduced in mid

In untreated females mated with 
high dose-treated males (2nd 
mating), implantation and live pups 
were reduced.
TK: AUC0-24h at 3 and 15 mg/kg/day, 
respectively, were 24.1 and 435 
nmol.h/L for females on GD 15, and 
were 38 and 682 nmol.h/L for males 
at 6 months. Lower or similar Cmax 
and AUC of formoterol were 
observed during pregnancy and 
lactation compared to pre-pairing. A 
low transfer of formoterol to pups 
via the milk was observed. Male rats 
treated for 6 months showed higher 
plasma concentrations than did non-
pregnant females dosed for 12 days. 
Plasma concentrations of formoterol 
increased proportionally between 
0.2 and 3 mg/kg/day in both sexes, 
but at 15 mg/kg/day, the values 
were 3 to 8 times the predicted 
values.
Dams: No mortalities or clinical 
signs observed. Increased body 
weight and tachycardia noted 
Litters: No treatment-related 
differences or defects. Skeletal 
variants in mid and high dose 
groups not considered to be 
treatment-related. 
Note: No TK but exposure 
considered accurate from other 
repeat dose studies.
Maternal weight gain increase at all 
levels. At high dose, increase in 
placental weight and subcapsular 
liver cysts in foetuses.
TK: The mean Cmax values on Day 
12 and Day 18 were 1.6 and
2.5 nmol/L, 16 and 31.8 nmol/L and 
932 and 1350 nmol/L for the low, 
mid and high dose group, 
respectively. Corresponding mean 
AUC0-24h values on Day 12 and 
Day 18 were 4.4, 11.2 nmol.h/L, 
84.4 and 125.6 nmol.h/L and 2130 
and 3569 nmol.h/L, respectively. 
Rapid absorption and dose-linear 
responses observed. 
Dose-related increase in maternal 
body weight gain during gestation 
and lactation. Increased food 
consumption. 
Litter loss was slightly higher in mid 
and high dose groups. Fetal loss 
more common in neonatal period.

Studies on impurities
Evaluation of impurities and degradation products
Budesonide
Twelve related compounds are listed as impurities of budesonide, as described in the Ph.Eur. monograph and 
in Section 3.2.P.5.5 Characterization of Impurities in Drug Product. Impurities budesonide acetaldehyde 
acetal, D-homobudesonide, 14,15-dehydrobudesonide, desonide, budesonide related compound G, 
budesonide 21-acetate, and budesonide 21- butyrate are drug substance process impurities that do not 
increase on stability.  They are therefore controlled at the drug substance level and not included in the drug 
product specification. Impurities 16α-hydroxyprednisoline and 21-dehydrobudesonide are drug substance 
process impurities and were observed to increase under hydrolytic and oxidative forced degradation 
conditions but are not observed above method reporting limits (0.10 %) in the drug product at long term 
storage conditions.  
In forced degradation studies of the drug substance, the main routes of degradation yielded the 11-
ketobudesonide, 17-keto-16-butyrate, and 17-carboxylic acid impurities. The related compounds have known

structures and are present in the drug product at levels generally below the ICH qualification threshold of 
0.15% for drug substance and 1.0% for drug product as outlined in ICH guidance Q3A and Q3B. 
Formoterol
Related Compounds A through I are impurities of formoterol as described in the Ph.Eur. monograph as 
described in Section 3.2.P.5.5 Characterization of Impurities in Drug Product. One addition impurity, Impurity 
5, has been identified by the drug substance supplier as a potential synthetic impurity and degradation 
product.  In forced degradation studies of drug substance, the main routes of degradation yielded Related 
Compounds A, F, G and Impurity 5. Various unidentified peaks were also observed. Accelerated stability 
studies of BGF MDI drug product demonstrated that reactions yielding known impurities Related Compounds 
A, F and G were the primary degradation pathways. Related compounds B, C, D, E, and H are drug substance 
manufacturing impurities which do not increase in concentration during storage. The related compounds have 
known structures and are present in the drug product at levels generally below the ICH qualification threshold 
of 0.15% for drug substance and 1.0% for drug product as outlined in ICH guidance Q3A and Q3B.  
Glycopyrrolate
Stability studies of BGF MDI drug product did not indicate degradation of glycopyrronium bromide under any 
storage condition as described in Section 3.2.P.5.5 Characterization of Impurities in Drug Product. Four 
specified glycopyrronium bromide impurities are included in the drug substance specification.  Ph. Eur. 
Impurity J (2-Cyclopentyl-2-hydroxy-2- phenylacetic acid, CPMA) is also included in the drug product 
specification.  Forced degradation studies of drug substance demonstrated that hydrolytic cleavage of the 
ester moiety to yield Impurity J was the main route of degradation.  Ph. Eur. Impurity O (5-Nitrobenzene-1,3 
dicarboxylic acid), Impurity G (1-Methylpyrrolidin-3-yl-2-cyclopentyl-2- hydroxy-2 phenylacetate) and 
Impurity N (Erythro Isomer) are drug substance manufacturing impurities which do not increase in 
concentration during storage.
The related compounds have known structures and are present in the drug product at levels below the ICH 
qualification threshold of 0.15% for drug substance and 1.0% for drug product as outlined in ICH guidance 
Q3A and Q3B.  The concentrations of these compounds in the toxicology studies and the proposed drug 
product specification for them are located in Table 2.6.7.4 Toxicology: Drug Substance (Glycopyrrolate). 
Porous particles
Porous particles are manufactured by spray drying a mixture of calcium chloride and 1,2 distearoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) in the presence of the processing aids water and Perflubron (also called 
PFOB).  Porous particles may contain impurities present in raw materials as well as residual processing aid; 
therefore, the following organic impurities may be observed:



Combination of 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-hydroxy-2- stearoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine. Raw material impurity and degradation product formed from hydrolysis of 
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Described with internal code Lyso.
Free fatty acid, composed principally of octadecanoic acid. Raw material impurity and degradation 
product formed from hydrolysis of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Described as free 
fatty acid. 
1-Bromoheptadecafluorooctane. Manufacturing processing aid. Described as Perflubron or PFOB.
PFOB is a manufacturing impurity resulting from incomplete evaporation of processing aid during spray 
drying, and it does not increase in concentration during storage.  It is therefore not included in the drug 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 69/238
 
 
product specification.  Free fatty acid is formed in stoichiometric symmetry with Lyso.  Both free fatty acid 
and Lyso content do not increase on long term storage and therefore are not specified in the drug product. 
The excipient assessment program for DSPC is discussed in more detail in Section 2.6.6.9.1. S-lyso-
phosphatidylcholine (S-lyso-PC or Lyso), is present in DSPC as an impurity resulting from hydrolysis of DSPC. 
S-lyso-PC is also a normal constituent of human lungs as a result of the metabolism and recycling of 
phosphatidylcholines (Rooney, 1992; Veldhuizen, 1998). Levels of S-lyso-PC of 0.3% of phosphatidylcholines 
(PC) have been detected in rat lungs and trace levels estimated as 0.1% in human lungs (Veldhuizen, 1998). 
As PCs are present at 22 mg/kg in human lung surfactant, this means that the levels of S-lyso-PC in human 
lung surfactant are approximately 1,300 µg. Maximum S-Lyso-PC levels deposited in human lungs would be 
approximately 5 µg (973 µg x 0.005), if S-lyso-PC were present at the upper specification limit. Therefore, 
maximum S lyso-PC levels resulting from deposited formulations would be approximately 260-fold less than 
endogenous S-lyso-PC levels in human lung surfactant. These low levels present negligible risk to patients, as 
toxicities from S lyso-PC have only been observed when associated with S-lyso-PC levels considerably higher 
than normal endogenous levels (Niewoehner, 1987; Arbibe, 1998).
Residual solvents
Solvents are controlled in the incoming active ingredient materials by the relevant drug substance 
specifications as described in Section 3.2.P.5.5 Characterization of Impurities in Drug Product.  Solvents are 
also controlled in raw materials used for the manufacture of porous particles by the relevant raw material 
specifications.  No solvents are used during the manufacture of the drug product.  All solvents used in the 
raw materials are below the ICH threshold for safety concern.
Inorganic impurities
Inorganic impurities are controlled by the relevant drug substance specifications as described in Section 
3.2.P.5.5 Characterization of Impurities in Drug Product, and by the grade of raw materials used to 
manufacture porous particles and container closure components. Levels of inorganic impurities do not 
approach the ICH threshold for safety concern.
Foreign particulate matter
All detected foreign particulate matter (FPM), attributable to the drug product, comprised expected materials 
(based on the container closure system (CCS) and manufacturing process) and will have been included in 
toxicology studies to support safety.  The primary contributor to FPM in the drug product is the CCS (mainly 
the valve).  Contributions by the manufacturing process, raw materials, and packaging were intermittent and 
of very low levels. Overall, the FPM levels did not exceed the ICH threshold for safety concern.
Evaluation of leachables and extractables
The container closure system, valve components, coated can and actuator have a number of plastic and 
elastomeric components from which a range of compounds including volatile organic species, long chain fatty 
acids, branched chain alkenes, aromatic antioxidants and plastic oligomers could potentially leach or be 
extracted into the formulation. Potential leachables and extractables have been identified through controlled 
extraction experiments and stability studies.  Key extractables are monitored and controlled by the 
component suppliers.
To monitor leachable compounds in the drug product, specific sensitive analytical methods have been 
developed and validated, and testing conducted on drug product after storage under long term and 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 70/238
 
 
accelerated storage conditions, for up to 18 months. A detailed description of the leachable species and 
controlled extraction studies is presented in Section 3.2.P.2 Pharmaceutical Development.
The following sections provide a brief risk assessment summary of the leachables based on the toxicology 
literature where pertinent and available.
Methylparaben
The permissible daily exposure (PDE) for methylparaben was calculated based on the assumption that the 
percentage of methylparaben in the inhalation drug product is at, and does not exceed, the allowable limit of 
0.07%, as defined in the FDA Inactive Ingredient Database (FDA Database). A PDE of 0.171 mg/day 
methylparaben was calculated using this assumption in conjunction with the daily inhalation volume expected 
with clinical use of the inhalation drug product. A conservative inhalation acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 1 
mg/kg/day was established from the oral ADI of 10 mg/kg/day. For adults (60 kg body weight), the 
inhalation ADIs is approximately 351 times the PDE, suggesting no concern for human health risk.
Parabens are a group of the alkyl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid and are widely used as preservatives in 
cosmetics, toiletries, and pharmaceuticals due to their relatively low toxicity profile and a long history of safe 
use (Golden, 2005).  As the chain length of the ester group of paraben increases, antimicrobial activity 
increases, but water solubility decreases (Goyal, 2014). Parabens are reported to be used in over 22,000 
cosmetics as preservatives at concentrations up to 0.8% (mixtures of parabens) or up to 0.4% (single 
paraben) (CIR, 2008). The FDA allows the use of specified parabens, to include methylparaben, as inactive 
ingredients in various pharmaceutical drug products (FDA Database).  In a 2006 review, industry reported to 
the FDA that methylparaben was used in 8786 products across a wide range of product categories (CIR, 
2008). Teratogenicity studies using methylparaben were negative.  Administration of methylparaben (5.5-
550 mg/kg) to pregnant mice or rats for ten days (days 6 to 10 of gestation) had no effect on nidation or on 
maternal or fetal survival.  In rabbits and hamsters, doses up to 300 mg/kg for 13 and 5 days, respectively, 
produced the same results. The number of abnormalities in soft or skeletal tissues of the treated animals did 
not differ from that of the controls (CIR, 1984; Soni, 2001, Soni, 2005; as cited in ILS, 2005).  In male 
Wistar rats, methylparaben (0.1 or 1.0%) administered for eight weeks produced no changes in sperm 
counts in cauda epididymis and testis and no changes in the levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and 
follicle stimulating hormone (Oishi, 2004; as cited in ILS, 2005).
Parabens were non-mutagenic in several in vitro assays, although methyl and ethyl paraben increased 
chromosomal abnormalities in some animal cell assays (CIR, 2008).  Parabens have not been found to be 
animal carcinogens (Soni, 2002).  The FDA classifies methyl and n- propyl paraben as generally recognised 
as safe (GRAS) for addition to foods, up to 0.1% (21 CFR 184.1490), and allows these and butyl paraben up 
to specified amounts as additives and preservatives in specific foods (21 CFR 172.515) (Soni, 2005; as cited 
in CDC, 2016). Methylparaben is hydrolysed to p-hydroxybenzoic acid, conjugated, and the conjugates are 
rapidly excreted in the urine. There is no evidence of accumulation. Acute toxicity studies in animals indicate 
that methylparaben is practically non-toxic by both oral and parenteral routes. In a population with normal 
skin, methylparaben is practically non-irritating and non- sensitizing. In chronic administration studies, no-
observed-effect levels (NOEL) as high as 1050 mg/kg have been reported and a NOAEL in the rat of 5700 
mg/kg is posited (Soni, 2002). 
As reported in CIR, 2008, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA, 1998) updated its 
specification for methylparaben in 1998 and reiterated its 1973 finding that the group ADI for ethyl, methyl, 
and propyl p-hydroxybenzoic acid in food is 0 to 10 mg/kg/day (JECFA, 1998). The European Food Safety 
Authority (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavouring, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 71/238
 
 
Food adopted an opinion on the safety of paraben usage in food (EFSA, 2004), which stated that the ADI of 0 
to 10 mg/kg/day for the sum of methylparaben and ethylparaben is still valid. The opinion also stated, 
however, that propylparaben should not be included in the ADI.  EFSA, 2004 opinion cited reduction is sperm 
production in juvenile male rats fed propylparaben at 10 mg/kg/day as the lowest observable adverse effect 
dose and contrasted these findings with the absence of effect for methylparaben and ethylparaben at doses 
up to 1000 mg/kg/day (CIR, 2008).  Studies in young male rats exposed during development have shown 
adverse effects on sperm production and testosterone levels following exposure to parabens with longer side 
chains, i.e. butyl, isobutyl and propylparabens (Goyal, 2014). Although the FDA classifies methylparaben as 
GRAS, the EFSA, 2004 accepted ADI of 10 mg/kg/day for methylparaben and ethylparaben in food forms the 
basis for establishing a conservative inhalation ADI for methylparaben in this review.  The oral ADI of 10 
mg/kg/day is divided by an uncertainty factor (safety factor) of 10 to establish an inhalation ADI of 1 
mg/kg/day for methylparaben.
Propylparaben
The PDE for propylparaben was calculated based on the assumption that the percentage of propylparaben in 
the inhalation drug product is at, and does not exceed, the allowable limit of 0.0375%, as defined in the FDA 
Inactive Ingredient Database (FDA Database).  A PDE of 0.092 mg/day propylparaben was calculated using 
this assumption in conjunction with the daily inhalation volume expected with clinical use of the inhalation 
drug product. An inhalation TTC was established using the oral TTC of 1.8 mg/day for a 60 kg human, 
obtained using Toxtree.  For adults, the inhalation TTC is approximately 20 times the PDE, suggesting no 
concern for human health risk. Also see Section 9.3.1 on Methylparaben for a general discussion of the safety 
of parabens, which is also relevant to Propylparaben.
Polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) oligomers
Although PBT oligomers do not present a safety concern when used in food contact plastics up to 1% w/w 
(EFSA, 2009), a comparison of the assessed TTC of 90 μg/day for a 60 kg human to the maximum theoretical 
inhalation dose level of 29.4 μg/kg/day, based on component extractives specifications (Bamford, 2005) 
could be of concern. This dose level is approximately 20 times the assessed TTC. However, the actual daily 
exposure to PBT oligomers with clinical use of BGF MDI is expected to be significantly less than the maximum 
theoretical dose due to less stringent extraction conditions in the final product in comparison to the 
component extractives testing. An in silico determination of a TTC for PBT dimer was made using Toxtree, a 
widely-used toxicity assessment software tool based on a decision tree approach using molecular structure 
(functional groups) as determinant factors (Kroes, 2004). PBT oligomers in general (e.g., dimers, trimers) 
are expected to produce the same TTC values using this decision tree approach; as such, a TTC of 90 μg/day 
is assessed for the PBT oligomers group having structure as defined above.  The TTC for the PBT oligomers 
group is 90 μg/day for a 60 kg human.
The scientific opinion of EFSA, 2009 concluded that there is “no safety concern for the substance cyclic 
oligomers of (butylene terephthalate), CAS No. 263244-54-8, if the substance is only used in PET, PBT, PC, 
PS and rigid PVC plastics up to 1% w/w, in contact with aqueous, acidic and alcoholic foods, for long term 
storage at room temperature.  The substance cyclic oligomers of (butylene terephthalate) is a mixture mainly 
composed of the dimer (Mw=440 Da, 33 %), the trimer (Mw=660 Da, 39%), the tetramer (Mw=880 Da, 
12%) and the pentamer (Mw=1100 Da, 13%). 85% of the mixture has a molecular weight below 1000 Da. 
PBT oligomers are formed “from the monomers terephthalic acid and 1,4-butanediol, which are authorised 
with restrictions of 7.5 mg/kg food and 5 mg/kg food, respectively.  Starting monomers are devoid of 
functional groups associated with genotoxicity and so are the oligomeric esters resulting from their reaction.

In conclusion, no genotoxic properties are expected from the substance cyclic oligomers of 
(butyleneterephthalate), CAS No. 263244 54 8” (EFSA, 2009).
1,3 and 1,4-Isopropanol acetophenone
Due to the lack of relevant toxicological literature for establishing ADIs for these leachables, in silico 
determinations of mutagenicity potential, carcinogenicity potential and threshold of toxicological concern 
(TTC) were made using Toxtree, a widely-used toxicity assessment software tool based on a decision tree 
approach using molecular structure (functional groups) as determinant factors (SCA-SR013A2, 2016). 1,3- 
and 1,4-Isopropanol acetophenone were assessed to be negative for genotoxic carcinogenicity and negative 
for nongenotoxic carcinogenicity, but a structural alert for nongenotoxic carcinogenicity was identified via the 
Toxtree Carcinogenicity (Genotox and Nongenotox) and Mutagenicity Rulebase by ISS module. No alerts for 
S. typhimurium mutagenicity were found via the Toxtree In Vitro Mutagenicity (Ames Test) Alerts by ISS 
module.  An oral TTC of 90 μg/day was established for adults (60 kg body weight) for these leachables via 
the Toxtree Kroes TTC Decision Tree module (SCA-SR013A2, 2016). This TTC is considered valid even though 
a potential structural alert for genotoxic carcinogenicity was found, as there are no structural similarities to 
the five defined groups of high potency carcinogenicity structural motifs, as identified by (Kroes, 2004, 
Benigni and Bossa, 2006). The PDEs for 1,3- and 1,4-Isopropanol acetophenone were calculated based on 
component extractives specifications, and gave a theoretical maximum exposure of 1.33 μg/day. 
Conservative inhalation TTCs of 9 μg/kg/day were established from the oral TTC of 90 μg/day. The inhalation 
TTCs are approximately 7 times the PDE, suggesting no concern for human health risk for these leachables.
Aliphatic hydrocarbons (C8 to C15 alkanes)
Due to the variability of potential hydrocarbon species that may be present in the drug product, taken 
together with insufficient data on aliphatic hydrocarbons, a compound or class specific PDE value for the 
groups of aliphatic compounds was not calculated; however, based on the limited data that was available (i.e. 
generally low toxicity and unlikely risk for potential for genotoxicity/mutagenicity), the threshold of 
toxicological concern (TTC) approach was determined to be appropriated for use in the risk assessment. 
(Stanard, 2018). The PQRI (Product Quality Research Institute) has developed science based safety 
thresholds for leachables and extractables in orally inhaled and nasal drug products, including MDIs (PQRI, 
2007). PQRI established a qualification threshold (QT) (i.e. TTC) of 5 μg per day, below which a non-
carcinogenic leachable is not considered for safety qualification unless it presents structure-activity 
relationship concerns (PQRI, 2007). Since aliphatic hydrocarbons (i.e. alkanes) are assumed to have low 
order of toxicity and unlikely to be genotoxic and/or carcinogenic, it is appropriate to use the guidance 
developed by PQRI and a Qualification Threshold (QT) of 5 μg per day for alkanes.
Siloxanes (D4 and D5)
The extensive published toxicology data on siloxanes is reviewed in SCA-SR014D, 2016. No observed adverse 
effect levels (NOAEL) or lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) were used to compute an acceptable 
daily intake (ADI) based on uncertainty factor multiples of 10 and mean body weight of 60 kg. The calculated 
ADI was then compared to the potential daily exposure (PDE) to estimate the human health risk. Siloxanes 
D4 and D5 were determined to be safe at the stated PDEs (1.33 μg/day), as ADI/PDE ratios were 2,346 -fold 
for D4 and 663-fold for D5.

Evaluation of excipients
The triple combination and all mono component and dual combination pMDIs presented in this submission are 
formulated using the same porous particle technology platform.  When co-suspended with micronised drug 
substance crystals in HFA-134a, they form a stable suspension pMDI formulation. Multiple inhaled toxicology 
studies have been conducted with the triple combination and various monocomponent and dual combination 
formulations, and no clinically meaningful differences have been observed in the placebo and air control 
groups in any study. The lack of adverse findings from the high-dose vehicle and air control comparator 
treatment arms from the completed 3 and 6-month studies in dogs, 6-month study in rats, and the mouse 
and rat carcinogenicity studies, support the safety of these excipients. 
HFA-134a is used as the propellant in this pMDI system.  Many nonclinical and clinical programs have been 
conducted in support of the approval of a number of HFA 134a propellant-based products and have shown 
that HFAs are safe and do not react with the respective drugs or alter mechanisms of action, metabolism, or 
side effect profiles. Investigations of the toxicology and safety profile of HFA 134a have been undertaken by 
an international consortium of interested pharmaceutical companies (IPACT I), and a positive opinion on the 
proposed use of HFA 134a has been given by the EU Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products on 12 July 
1994.
The excipient, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), is a synthetic, non-animal derived, long-
chain fully saturated phosphatidylcholine, with stearic acid as its fatty acid component. Phosphatidylcholines 
are natural components of cell membranes, and are the primary lipid constituent of lung surfactant. DSPC 
has the Chemical Abstracts Registry (CAS) number 816-94-4 and is the main component of the porous 
particle technology platform.
Human pulmonary surfactant is composed of roughly 85% phospholipid, 10% protein, and 5% neutral lipids.  
The predominant phospholipid in surfactant is dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), a saturated 16-carbon 
fatty acid, representing 68% of the total phosphatidylcholines. DSPC, a saturated 18-carbon 
phosphatidylcholine comprises 4.5% of the total phosphatidylcholines (Rooney, 1992).  The roles of 
surfactant, and the phospholipid

2.3.4.1.2.  Genotoxicity studies with DSPC
DSPC was evaluated in the bacterial reverse mutation, chromosome aberration and in vivo mouse 
micronucleus assays. No positive effects were observed. 
2.3.4.1.3.  Reproductive toxicity studies of DSPC
A suite of studies with repeated intra-peritoneal administration of DSPC is included for the evaluation of 
reproductive toxicity of DSPC.
Fertility and early embryonic development
DSPC was administered parenterally by intraperitoneal injection in a vehicle of corn oil (1 ml/kg daily) at dose 
levels of 0 (vehicle control), 1, 25, and 50 mg/kg to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Each group 
consisted of 25 rats/sex plus 3 Toxicokinetic (TK) rats/sex; males were dosed for 4 weeks prior to and during 
mating and until their scheduled necropsy, while females were dosed for at least 2 weeks prior to mating, 
during mating and through gestation day 6 (i.e., implantation). Blood samples for toxicokinetics were 
collected from 3 TK rats/sex/time-point following the first and last doses prior to mating (for males this 
corresponded to study days 1 and 28 ± 2, while for females it corresponded to study day 1 and 14 (± 1 day) 
of the premating period). Dams underwent caesarean sections on gestation day 13 after receiving a minimum 
of 28 daily doses, while males received at least 45 daily doses and were then sacrificed after mating. Rats 
were mated 1:1 within group. Toxicology parameters evaluated included body weights, food consumption, 
clinical observations, mating performance, oestrus cyclicity, reproductive performance, sperm analyses, 
organ weights and gross pathology. Systemic exposure was evident in the plasma levels of the TK animals, 
although endogenous levels were also observed. Proof of exposure was demonstrated although variable in 
both sexes. Overall mating performance (percent sperm positive successful mating outcome, oestrus 
cyclicity, sperm motility and morphology) was unaffected by treatment. Based on the results of this study, 
the NOAEL of DSPC on reproductive function is 50 mg/kg for males and females, and the NOAEL for systemic 
toxicity was also 50 mg/kg.
Embryofetal development
In the definitive rat study (15-802), DSPC was administered parenterally by intraperitoneal injection in a 
vehicle of corn oil (1 mL/kg) at dose levels of 0 (vehicle control), 1, 25, and 50 mg/kg to 23 time-mated 
Sprague-Dawley female rats, plus an additional 3 or 6 Toxicokinetic (TK) rats, per group. Doses were 
administered once daily over gestation days 6 through 17. The TK rats were bled at designated time-points 
bracketing the first and last dose (on gestation days 6 and 17, respectively). Maternal body weight, body 
weight gain and food consumption were measured throughout the gestation period. Dams were euthanised 
on the 21st day of gestation and subjected to a caesarean section and gross necropsy. The uteri were 
weighed, opened and inspected for implantation sites; fetuses were harvested, weighed, given a gross 
external examination. One-half of the fetuses in each litter were subjected to visceral examinations, while 
control and high dose fetuses were subjected to skeletal and/or cephalic examinations. Systemic exposure 
was evident in the plasma levels of the TK rats, although endogenous levels were also observed. Proof of 
exposure was demonstrated although variable. No treatment related clinical signs were seen during the 
study.

EMA/582495/2020

Overall, litter viability (live, non-live, total implants, pre- and post implantation loss) were unaffected by 
intraperitoneal with DSPC at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day; although fetal loss was lower in the treated groups 
relative to controls. No effect on growth was noted as fetal body weights were similar between the treated 
groups and controls; although a statistically significantly increase in fetal body weights (~6% for sexes 
combined) was seen in the 50 mg/kg treated group, this was not considered toxicological relevant and likely 
associated with normal biological variation. Fetal anomalies were low in incidence and randomly distributed 
across groups and those seen were most likely procedural in nature (i.e. associated with the intraperitoneal 
injection itself). Fetal examinations (gross external, skeletal, visceral and cephalic) did not reveal any frank 
pattern of teratogenicity. Based on findings from this study, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) 
for maternal and developmental toxicity of DSPC was 50 mg/kg.
In the definitive rabbit study DSPC was administered by intraperitoneal injection in a vehicle of corn oil (1 
mL/kg) at dose levels of 0 (vehicle control), 1, 25, and 50 mg/kg/day to 23 time-mated New Zealand White 
female rabbits/group. Doses were administered once daily over gestation days 6 through 18. Maternal body 
weight, body weight gain and food consumption were measured throughout the gestation period. Dams were 
euthanised on the 29th day of gestation and subjected to a caesarean section and gross necropsy. In 
addition, all fetuses were subjected to a visceral examination and processed for skeletal evaluation, while 
approximately one-third of the foetuses from each litter were designated for cephalic examination (control 
and high dose groups examined). None of the rabbits died during the study and no clinical signs of toxicity 
were seen. No evidence of maternal toxicity was seen in food consumption, body weight/body weight gain or 
gravid uterus weight. Total gain corrected for uterine weights were similar across groups and unaffected by 
treatment. Gross necropsy findings were generally unremarkable; however, evidence of residual test material 
in the peritoneal cavity as the time of c-section showed the maximum feasible dose was given and provided 
systemic exposure throughout the dosing period and until euthanasia. Systemic exposure was evident in the 
plasma levels of the TK rabbits, although endogenous levels were also observed. Proof of exposure was 
demonstrated although variable. 
No statistically significant difference in litter viability (pre- and post- implantation loss, live, non-live and total 
implants) were seen between the treated and controls. Corpora lutea, pre- and post- implantation loss, live, 
non-live and total implants were similar across groups. Overall, fetal viability was unaffected by treatment 
and no increase in fetal loss was observed (post implantation loss). Fetal weights were unaffected by 
treatment at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day. No frank morphological changes were seen in the gross external, 
visceral, cephalic or skeletal examinations of the treated fetuses. Findings observed were low in incidence 
and within published historical control range. Based on the findings from this study, the NOAEL for maternal 
and developmental toxicity was 50 mg/kg/day
Peri- and post-natal development, including maternal function
In the rat study, DSPC was administered by intraperitoneal injection in a vehicle of corn oil (1 mL/kg) at dose 
levels of 0 (vehicle control), 1, 25 and 50 mg/kg/day to 24 sperm positive dams (F0 Sprague- Dawley rats) 
per group for assessment of maternal reproductive function/parturition, prenatal and postnatal development 
including effects on growth, behaviour and general development through sexual maturity including evaluation 
of reproductive competence of the offspring. F0dams were dosed from gestation day 6 through parturition 
and lactation until weaning (postnatal day 21). In addition, each treated group had 3 satellite dams 
designated for toxicokinetic (TK) evaluations (TK dams were dosed as above and blood samples were 
collected from dams and pups on lactation day 3 or 4).  The F1 rats selected to produce the F2-generation 
were not intentionally exposed to DSPC. Litters from the F0 and F1 dams were culled on postnatal day 4. 
Food consumption, body weights, body weight gain, reproductive performance and organ weights were

evaluated during the study, along with offspring body weights (growth), survival and developmental 
landmarks (vaginal patency and preputial separation for the F1 generation). Gross sensory function and 
reflex responses, as well as automated acoustical startle, motor activity and water maze (learning and 
memory paradigm) were evaluated in the F1 pups selected to produce the F2 generation. Systemic exposure 
was evident in the plasma levels of the TK rats, although endogenous levels were also observed. Proof of 
exposure was demonstrated although variable in both the dam and the pups.
No treatment-related deaths occurred in adult F0 animals; however, a number of the F0 dams distributed 
across all groups including controls died or were sacrificed in a moribund state during the lactation phase of 
the study. The exact cause of these deaths is unknown but based on their distribution (five, seven, five and 
three in the 0, 1, 25 and 50 mg/kg groups) they were not considered to be related to treatment with DSPC. 
No treatment-related clinical signs of toxicity were seen during the study. A few statistically significant 
differences in food consumption, body weights and body weight gain were seen but these were not 
considered treatment-related but more likely associated with normal biological variation. The average length 
of gestation was 21 days and the percentage of F0 dams undergoing successful parturition 
(delivered/pregnant x 100) was 100% for the controls, 92% in the 1 and 50 mg/kg treated groups and 96% 
in the 25 mg/kg treated group. The number of implantation sites and average F1 litter size (total born for 
combined sexes) were similar in the control and treated groups and no difference was seen in post-
implantation loss, although the overall range was 1.3-3, slightly above the background range of 0.8-1. 
Overall survival ranged from 86 to 96% on postnatal day 0 and 98 to 100% over postnatal day 4-21.
Developmental landmarks (eye opening and negative geotaxis of F1- and F2-generations, preputial 
separation and vaginal patency of F1-generation) were not affected by treatment. There were no apparent 
treatment-related differences in the evaluation of sensory function (pupil response, tactile placing), reflex 
response (aerial righting reflex and hind-limb extension), acoustical startle response, motor activity or 
learning and memory (water maze) in the F1-generation. Mating performance and fertility of the F1-
generation was similar across groups. Pre-weaning body weights of the F2-generation were also similar 
across groups. No overt maternal toxicity was seen in F0 dams treated with 1, 25 or 50 mg/kg DSPC. No 
treatment-related alterations in body weights, growth, survival or development were seen in the F1- or F2- 
generation. Based on the findings from this study, the NOAEL for systemic exposure of DSPC in the F0-
generation was 50 mg/kg. The NOAEL for reproductive toxicity of the F0 generation was 50 mg/kg and the 
reproductive NOAEL was also 50 mg/kg for males and females of the F1-generation. Finally, the NOAEL for 
developmental toxicity, was 50 mg/kg.

2.3.6.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
Budesonide PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log 
Kow does not exceed 4.5. However, considering that budesonide is classified as endocrine active a tailored 
Phase II assessment was performed on this basis. In a tailored Phase II assessment budesonide was not 
readily biodegradable but did not significantly absorb to solids during sewage treatment and is expected to 
pass into the aquatic environment. The water-sediment transformation study demonstrated budesonide not 
to be persistent and no bioaccumulation was seen in the fish bioconcentration assay. Therefore, budesonide 
does not fulfil the classification of a PBT substance.

As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the 
potential risk of BGF MDI to the environment.
Toxicity studies for algal growth and Daphnia growth and reproduction have been completed, however, a fish 
full life-cycle test is outstanding to address the potential for chronic effects to fish and will be submitted as a 
post-approval measure as agreed with the applicant.
2.3.7.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
Limited studies have been conducted with BGF pMDI in the non-clinical package. No new pharmacology 
studies have been conducted with BGF pMDI which is in line with the guidance on the development of fixed-
dose combinations (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). The inclusion of a literature review on the 
pharmacology of the individual components and dual combination products adequately support this 
application. Safety pharmacology studies were performed in tandem with repeat-dose toxicology studies in 
dogs. Low magnitude increases in heart rate and minor effects on respiratory parameters (tidal and minute 
volume) were noted in the 14-day study, however no effects were observed in the 3-month study. 
Similarly, limited PK studies have been performed for BGF pMDI. PK data was obtained from repeat-dose 
toxicity studies with BGF pMDI in the rat and dog using a validated method. In addition, PK data for the 
individual components and dual combinations were included for comparison. Similar PK parameters were 
observed for BGF pMDI and individual components and exposure was not significantly different in BGF 
studies. 
Single and repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed with BGF pMDI. The adverse effects observed in 
single-dose studies include laboured breathing (rats) and slight increases in heart rate (dogs). Repeat-dose 
studies observed a number of non-respiratory treatment effects in rats, including stomach ulceration, 
bodyweight reductions and mortality and histopathological changes in a number of organs including the 
adrenal gland, thymus and liver. These effects were attributed to the known systemic effects of budesonide, 
and mortality was attributed to systemic inflammation due to chronic immunosuppression. In repeat-dose 
studies in dogs, similar histopathological changes were observed, and recovery was evident in most

parameters although adrenal and thymic alterations persisted somewhat.  No NOAELs were observed in any 
of the aforementioned toxicology studies. Toxicokinetic data from the 3-month dog study was used to 
calculated exposures relative to the assumed daily clinical exposure. This revealed no margins of exposure at 
the low dose level. Greater margins were observed relative to mid (2.3 - 5.2 (Cmax)) and high dose (ranging 
2.2 - 4.5 (AUC0-24) and 19.6 - 33.7 (Cmax)) groups. Despite the absence of margins of exposure, clinical 
experience with these active substances including budesonide suggests that there may be no significant 
clinical concern. 
Genotoxicity testing of each single agent (budesonide, glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate) was 
concluded to be negative. No genotoxicity assays were performed with the triple combination. As no specific 
genetic toxicity was identified for individual agents therefore the combination of the 3 components is not 
expected to have an altered genotoxicity profile as compared with those of the individual ones. 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed for the BGF pMDI. Studies with the individual components were 
included to support BGF pMDI. No carcinogenic effects were identified in budesonide-treated mice. The 
incidence of astrocytomas was higher in male rats and neoplasms were observed in one study. One key 
deficiency in budesonide carcinogenicity studies was the absence of TK data. Additionally, budesonide was 
administered orally which is not in line with ICH S1A which states that carcinogenicity studies should be 
performed with the intended clinical administration i.e. inhalation. It is unclear if adequate exposure to 
budesonide was achieved, although some effects e.g. lower levels of leukocytes and lymphocytes and 
decreased spleen wright, suggest exposure was achieved. Formoterol studies identified increases in the 
incidences of haemangioma and hepatocellular tumours in female and male mice, respectively, and 
mesovarian leiomyomas in female rats. No significant carcinogenic effects were observed with glycopyrrolate 
and although no toxicokinetic were performed previous repeat dose toxicity studies via inhaled administration 
have demonstrated exposure which is considered sufficient. 
No reproductive and developmental toxicology studies were conducted with BGF pMDI. Individual studies with 
formoterol and glycopyrrolate identified toxicities at doses with large safety margins and are not clinically 
relevant. Minimal transfer of formoterol to the maternal milk in rats was noted and this is reflected in section 
4.6 of the SmPC. In budesonide studies embryo-foetal effects were seen in rat and rabbits, however, no 
exposure data is available from these studies. Based on the well-known clinical experience with budesonide 
and the proposed clinical schedule these effects are not considered relevant in humans at the clinical 
exposure levels associated with use of BGF pMDI.
The environmental risk assessment cannot currently be concluded as issues and deficiencies in a fish full 
lifecycle study (Study COS-001/4-49/A) which was submitted for the Phase II assessment for budesonide 
were identified at the late stage of the assessment. That study is now considered unreliable and therefore the 
applicant has indicated that a new fish full life-cycle study for budesonide will be performed and submitted as 
a post-authorisation measure, which is acceptable by CHMP.
2.3.8.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

2.4.  Clinical aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
GCP
Two GCP inspections were conducted for this application:
- A routine GCP inspection of clinical trial PT010006 at 2 clinical investigator sites (one in China and one in 
Japan) and the sponsor site in the USA. As an outcome of this inspection, the inspectors recommended to use 
the study data from both investigator sites for evaluation and assessment of the application.
- A triggered GCP inspection of clinical trial PT010005 at the sponsor site in the USA which took place 
remotely. Concerns raised during the assessment in relation to the MAA of BGF were not confirmed, the trial 
decisions were found to be reasonable and timelines were clarified by the inspection team. Based on the 
results of this remote sponsor inspection, the inspection team was of the opinion that the quality of the data 
is acceptable for assessment.

All references in this document to doses of GFF MDI, GP MDI and BGF MDI for studies conducted after 
December 2012 are based on the mass of glycopyrronium.  For example, GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg contains 
14.4 µg of glycopyrronium and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate and GP MDI 14.4 µg contains 14.4 µg of 
glycopyrronium. The dose of glycopyrronium (14.4 µg) in GFF MDI and GP MDI is equivalent to 18 µg of 
glycopyrrolate (glycopyrronium bromide), which was used in the studies conducted prior to December 
2012.  All doses of GFF MDI, GP MDI and BGF MDI use the nomenclature at the time the study was 
conducted.
All references to doses of MDIs are to the ex-actuator dose, or the dose delivered from the actuator (ie, 
mouthpiece) of the MDI.

All references in this document to doses of GFF MDI, GP MDI and BGF MDI for studies conducted after December 
2012 are based on the mass of glycopyrronium.  For example, GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg contains 14.4 µg of 
glycopyrronium and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate and GP MDI 14.4 µg contains 14.4 µg of glycopyrronium. The dose 
of glycopyrronium (14.4 µg) in GFF MDI and GP MDI is equivalent to 18 µg of glycopyrrolate (glycopyrronium 
bromide), which was used in the studies conducted prior to December 2012.  All doses of GFF MDI, GP MDI and BGF 
MDI use the nomenclature at the time the study was conducted.
All references to doses of MDIs are to the ex-actuator dose, or the dose delivered from the actuator (ie, mouthpiece) 
of the MDI.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics
Introduction
BGF MDI is delivered by oral inhalation at a strength of either 80/7.2/4.8 μg of 
budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate per actuation (BGF MDI 80) or 160/7.2/4.8 μg of 
budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate per actuation (BGF MDI 160). BGF MDI is administered as 2 
oral inhalations twice daily (BID). The corresponding doses of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol 
fumarate are 160 or 320 μg, 14.4 μg, and 9.6 μg, respectively, administered BID, yielding a total daily dose 
of 320 or 640, 28.8 and 19.2 μg/day, respectively.
The major objectives of the BGF MDI clinical pharmacology program were to describe the PK properties of 
budesonide, glycopyrronium and formoterol, and the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on these 
individual components. This was achieved by an analysis of the results of clinical PK studies and human 
biomaterial studies, as well as a population PK analysis.
Methods
 Analytical methods
Determination of budesonide, glycopyrronium and formoterol in human plasma was accomplished using liquid 
chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The methods were sensitive for all 
analytes and fulfilled all the requirements and recommendations regarding linearity, accuracy, precision, 
sensitivity and specificity. Satisfactory method performance during study sample analysis was demonstrated. 
Incurred sample reanalysis was performed in all studies with satisfactory results. The submitted data 
regarding long-term stability of analyte in matrix covers the storage time in all studies.


Pharmacokinetic data analysis
Standard PK endpoints, calculated by non-compartmental methods using the software Phoenix® WinNonlin®, 
were used to characterise the PK profiles of budesonide, glycopyrronium and formoterol. A population PK 
(popPK) analysis was conducted using nonlinear mixed effects modelling with the importance sampling 
expectation maximization algorithm (NONMEM version 7.3).
Absorption

Bioavailability
Budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol are rapidly absorbed after inhaled administration, with time to 
maximum concentration occurring within 1 hour of administration.  The Cmax and AUC values generally 
increased in proportion to dose for all 3 compounds.
Budesonide
Following a single dose of BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 µg in subjects with COPD (Study PT010018), median tmax 
occurred at 0.33 hour, geometric mean Cmax was 709 pg/mL and AUC0-12 was 2407 pg·h/mL. During 
steady-state administration of BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 µg BID in subjects with COPD, median tmax occurred 
at 0.37 and 0.67 hour, geometric mean Cmax was 631 and 663 pg/mL and AUC0-12 was 2551 and 3005 
pg·h/mL in Studies PT010006 and PT010018, respectively.
Glycopyrronium
Following a single dose of BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg in subjects with COPD (Study PT010018), median tmax 
occurred at 0.03 hour, geometric mean Cmax was 17 pg/mL and AUC0-12 was 43 pg·h/mL. During steady-
state administration of BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg BID in subjects with COPD, median tmax occurred at about 
0.10 hour, geometric mean Cmax was about 18 pg/mL and AUC0-12 was about 74 pg·h/mL in both Studies 
PT010006 and PT010018.
Formoterol
Following single dose administration of BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg in subjects with COPD (Study PT010018), 
median tmax occurred at 0.33 hour, geometric mean Cmax was 6.4 pg/mL and AUC0-12 was 32.6 pg·h/mL. 
During steady-state dosing of BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg BID in subjects with COPD, median tmax occurred at 
0.67 and 0.96 hour, geometric mean Cmax was 7.4 and 8.4 pg/mL and AUC0-12 was 47 and 55 pg·h/mL in 
Studies PT010018 and PT010006, respectively.

Bioavailability of budesonide, glycopyrronium and formoterol from BGF MDI versus with 
and without a spacer
The PK and safety of BGF MDI when administered with and without a spacer in healthy subjects was 
investigated in a crossover design study (Study PT010011). The effect of the spacer on PK was determined 
when administered without activated oral charcoal (total systemic exposure) as well as with activated oral 
charcoal (lung exposure).
The total systemic exposure of BGF MDI administered through the spacer was increased compared to no 
spacer, with AUC0-t and Cmax, respectively, being 33% and 52% higher for budesonide, and 55% and 141% 
higher for glycopyrronium. Formoterol total systemic exposure with spacer was basically unchanged for 
AUC0-t and increased by 66% for Cmax. The lung exposure of BD MDI administered through the spacer was 
increased compared to no spacer, with AUC(0-last) and Cmax, respectively, being 98% and 84% higher for 
budesonide, 274% and 162% higher for glycopyrronium, and 285% and 123% higher for formoterol.

The quartile analysis showed that subjects who had low drug exposure without a spacer (likely due to poor 
inhalation technique) had a 2- to 4.5-fold increase in total systemic exposure when using the spacer, while 
for those who had high exposure without a spacer (likely due to good inhalation technique), the drug 
exposure was relatively unchanged by the spacer. The increases in lung exposure with spacer were greater 
than total systemic exposure.

Bioequivalence
BGF MDI vs BFF MDI
A direct comparison in healthy volunteers of budesonide and formoterol PK parameters between BGF MDI and 
BFF MDI was conducted in a crossover design study, PT010002. 
For the comparison of budesonide PK parameters for BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg vs BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg, the 
90% CIs for AUC0-12 and Cmax GMRs were both within 80% to 125%. Thus, bioequivalence for budesonide 
was demonstrated in the presence and absence of glycopyrronium indicating that glycopyrronium did not 
alter the PK of budesonide. For the comparison of formoterol PK parameters in BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg vs 
BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg, the 90% CIs for the AUC0-12 and Cmax GMRs were both within 80% to 125%. Thus, 
bioequivalence for formoterol was demonstrated in the presence and absence of glycopyrronium indicating 
that glycopyrronium did not alter the PK of formoterol.
An additional parallel group comparison of PK parameters for BGF MDI and BFF MDI was provided during 
steady-state dosing in patients with COPD from Study PT010006. Steady-state PK parameters for budesonide 
and formoterol were compared between BGF MDI and BFF MDI in patients with COPD in Study PT010006 as 
presented in Table 28. For budesonide the point estimates for the ratios of geometric LSMs were close to 
100% although the 90% CIs fell outside of the 80% to 125% limits for Cmax. For formoterol, AUC0-12 and 
Cmax were approximately 16% and 12% higher for BGF MDI than for BFF MDI and the 90% CIs fell outside 
of the 80% to 125% limits. However, these parallel group comparisons of PK parameters were for descriptive 
purposes and were not powered to establish bioequivalence nor were there any a priori success criteria.

BGF MDI vs GFF MDI
A direct comparison in healthy volunteers of glycopyrronium and formoterol PK parameters between BGF MDI 
and GFF MDI was conducted in a crossover design study, PT010001. Comparisons of PK parameters for BGF 
MDI vs GFF MDI in Study PT010001 are presented in Table 29. For formoterol, BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg vs 
GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg, the 90% CIs for the AUC0-12 and Cmax GMRs are all within 80% to 125%. Thus, 
bioequivalence was demonstrated for formoterol for each of the treatment comparisons. For glycopyrronium, 
BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg vs GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg, the point estimates for the AUC0-12 and Cmax GMRs are 
all within 80% to 125%; and the 90% CIs for AUC0-12 and Cmax are all within 67% to 150%. 
Bioequivalence was claimed to have been demonstrated for glycopyrronium for this treatment comparison 
based on the expanded criteria established in the protocol.
Table 29: Comparison of formoterol and glycopyrronium PK parameters for BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 μg vs GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg – Study PT010001
Additional parallel group comparisons of PK parameters for BGF MDI and GFF MDI were provided during 
steady-state dosing in patients with COPD from Study PT010006. For glycopyrronium, AUC0-12 and Cmax 
were modestly lower for BGF MDI compared with GFF MDI and the 90% CIs for the ratios of geometric LSMs 
fell outside of the 80% to 125% limits. For formoterol, AUC0-12 was comparable between BGF MDI and GFF 
MDI and the 90% CI for the ratio fell within the 80% to 125% limits. Formoterol Cmax was about 20% lower 
for BGF MDI compared with GFF MDI. However, these were parallel group comparisons of PK parameters for 
descriptive purposes and were not powered to establish bioequivalence nor were there any a priori success 
criteria.
BGF MDI vs Symbicort MDI
PK parameters for budesonide and formoterol were compared between BGF MDI and Symbicort MDI in Study 
PT010001. For BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg vs Symbicort MDI 320/9 μg, the 90% CIs for budesonide AUC0-12 
and Cmax GMRs were within 80% to 125% demonstrating bioequivalence for budesonide. For formoterol, the 
upper bound of the 90% CI was above 125% for both Cmax and AUC0-12. Formoterol exposure from BGF 
MDI was approximately 27% higher for AUC and 20% higher for Cmax vs Symbicort MDI.

EMA/582495/2020

BGF MDI vs Symbicort TBH
PK parameters for budesonide and formoterol were compared between BGF MDI and Symbicort TBH in Study 
PT010002. For the budesonide comparison of BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg vs Symbicort TBH 400/12 μg, the 
90% CI for both Cmax and AUC0-12 fell outside of the bioequivalence bounds of 80% to 125%. For 
formoterol, the point estimate and corresponding 90% CI for the AUC0-12 and Cmax parameters also fell 
outside of the bioequivalence bounds of 80% to 125%. Thus, bioequivalence could not be concluded for 
either of these treatment comparisons.
Table 30: Comparison of budesonide and formoterol PK parameters for BGF MDI MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 μg vs Symbicort TBH 400/12 μg – Study PT010002
Steady-state PK parameters for budesonide were compared between BGF MDI and Symbicort TBH in patients 
with COPD in Study PT010006. For budesonide AUC0-12 was about 12% higher for BGF MDI compared with 
Symbicort TBH and the 90% CI fell outside of the 80% to 125% limits. Budesonide Cmax values were 
comparable between the 2 products, although the 90% CI fell outside of the 80% to 125% limits. However, 
these were parallel group comparisons of PK parameters for descriptive purposes and were not powered to 
establish bioequivalence nor were there any a priori success criteria.
BFF MDI vs BD MDI and FF MDI
In Study PT009001, BFF MDI was compared with the individual components, BD MDI and FF MDI. 
For the comparison of budesonide PK parameters for BFF MDI vs BD MDI, the point estimates for AUC0-12 
and Cmax were entirely contained within the bounds of 80% to 125%. The corresponding 90% CI for AUC0-
12 was entirely contained within the standard limits of 80% to 125%, while the 90% CI for Cmax was 
entirely contained within the pre-defined expanded limits of 75% to 133%. Thus, comparable relative 
bioavailability was claimed to be demonstrated between BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg and BD MDI 320 μg treatments 
for budesonide.
For the comparison of formoterol PK parameters for BFF MDI vs FF MDI, the point estimates and 90% CI for 
AUC0-12 and Cmax were entirely contained within the bounds of 80% to 125%. Thus, comparable formoterol 
bioavailability was demonstrated within each of the treatment comparisons. 
Distribution
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 93/238
 
 
The unbound fraction of budesonide in plasma ranged from 12.8% to 14.5%. For glycopyrronium, the 
percentage unbound was found to be 51.6% (range 45.8% to 56.8%) in humans.  The unbound fraction of 
formoterol in human plasma was 54.1% 3.4% for the RR enantiomer and 41.9% 2.7% for the SS 
enantiomer.  
The apparent steady state volume of distribution for the typical individual based on the population PK 
analysis for budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol was estimated to be 1200 L, 5500 L, and 2400 L, 
respectively.
Elimination
 Metabolism and excretion
In vitro studies with human liver homogenates have shown that budesonide is rapidly and extensively 
metabolised via CYP3A4 to metabolites that are inactive. Budesonide is excreted in urine and feces in the 
form of metabolites. Approximately 60% of the dose was recovered in the urine, with no unchanged 
budesonide detected in urine. The effective terminal elimination half-life was estimated to be approximately 5 
hours based on simulated accumulation ratio for AUC from the population PK analysis.
Metabolism is considered to play a minor role in the overall elimination of glycopyrronium, which is primarily 
eliminated renally. The effective terminal elimination half-life was estimated to be approximately 15 hours 
based on simulated accumulation ratio for AUC from the population PK analysis.
The primary metabolism of formoterol is by direct glucuronidation and by O-demethylation followed by 
conjugation to inactive metabolites. The effective terminal elimination half-life was estimated to be 
approximately 10 hours based on simulated accumulation ratio for AUC from the population PK analysis.
Dose proportionality and time dependency
 Dose proportionality
Dose proportionality of budesonide was assessed across single doses ranging from 80 to 320 µg in a 
crossover design study (PT010001).Dose proportionality was demonstrated in the comparison of BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 µg compared with BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 µg. Comparison of both BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 µg 
and BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 µg with BGF MDI 80/14.4/9.6 µg suggested a slightly lower than proportional 
increase in exposure with increasing dose. Overall, it can be concluded that budesonide exposure increases in 
an approximately dose proportional manner.
Dose proportionality was not assessed for glycopyrronium or formoterol in this application, since only one 
dose strength of these components has been studied for BGF MDI. Previous studies demonstrated that the PK 
of glycopyrronium and formoterol were generally dose proportional. Dose proportionality for glycopyrronium 
and formoterol has been reviewed previously in the MAA for GFF MDI (Bevespi Aerosphere®). 

Time dependency
Budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol delivered by BGF MDI have accumulation ratios (Rac) following 
repeated dosing that are consistent with values previously documented for these compounds.  The mean AUC 
Rac values were approximately 1.3, 1.8, and 1.4 for budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol, 
respectively.

Intra- and inter-individual variability
Linear mixed effects models with day as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect were employed to 
estimate the linearity ratio for budesonide, glycopyrronium and formoterol PK after administration of BGF 
MDI 320/14.4/9.6 µg to subjects with COPD in Study PT0010018. The residual variance component from the 
model estimating Rlin provided an estimate of intra-subject variability. The intra-subject CVs for budesonide, 
glycopyrronium, and formoterol were 13.9%, 31.3%, and 15.4%, respectively.
Inter-subject CVs were also calculated from Study PT0010018. The inter-subject CVs for budesonide on Day 
1 and Day 8 ranged from 45.4% to 58.5% for AUC0-12 and from 57.2% to 65.8% for Cmax. The inter-
subject CVs for glycopyrronium on Day 1 and Day 8 ranged from 45.8% to 52.9% for AUC0-12 and from 
65.4% to 80.7% for Cmax. The inter-subject CVs for formoterol on Day 1 and Day 8 ranged from 30.0% to 
30.3% for AUC0-12 and from 38.1% to 48.1% for Cmax.
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis
Data from 9 clinical studies, in subjects with mild to very severe COPD, were included in the popPK analyses 
(Studies PT0010801, PT0031002, PT003006, PT003013, PT0050801, PT005003, PT009001, PT010006, and 
PT010018). Each study contained data on one or more of the following products: BGF MDI, BFF MDI, GFF 
MDI, BD MDI, GP MDI and/or FF MDI.

Budesonide
In total, 3930 samples from 220 subjects were included in the popPK analysis of budesonide. The final model 
for budesonide was a three-compartment model with first-order absorption. Covariates identified and 
included in the final model were body weight on both apparent inter-compartmental clearance parameters 
(Qp1/F and Qp2/F; increasing with increasing body weight), and age on CL/F (decreasing with increasing 
age). The parameter estimates for the final model, including outliers, are provided in Table 31. 
All evaluated sets of covariates had only a minor impact on Cmax, Cmin, and/or AUC of budesonide. The 
“worst case” combination of covariates (selected to obtain the highest Cmax/AUC for budesonide) consists of 
subjects with low body weight and high age. Considering the 10th percentiles of body weight and age in the 
budesonide data set (57.6 kg; 74 years), the change in median Cmax, Cmin, and AUC at steady state, 
relative to the typical individual, was predicted to be approximately 7%, -5%, and 7%, respectively. These 
differences were not considered clinically relevant.

 Glycopyrronium
In total, 7612 samples from 481 subjects were included in the population PK analysis of glycopyrronium. The 
final population PK model was a two-compartment model with first-order absorption. Important covariates 
identified and included in the final model were absolute eGFR on CL/F (increasing with increasing absolute 
eGFR), body weight on apparent volume of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments (Vc/F and 
Vp/F), and Q/F (increasing with increasing body weight), and smoking status on the absorption rate constant

(ka; higher for current smokers relative to former smokers) and relative bioavailability (Frel; lower for 
current smokers relative to former smokers). The parameter estimates for the final model, including outliers, 
are provided in Table 32. 
Absolute eGFR was the covariate that had the greatest impact on Cmax, Cmin, and AUC of glycopyrronium. 
The “worst case” combination of covariates (selected to obtain the highest Cmax/AUC for glycopyrronium) 
consists of subjects with low body weight, low absolute eGFR, and who are former smokers. Considering the 
10th percentiles of body weight and absolute eGFR in the glycopyrronium data set (57.6 kg; 63.7 mL/min), 
the increase in median Cmax, Cmin, and AUC at steady state, relative to the typical individual, was predicted 
to be approximately 21%, 30%, and 29%, respectively. These differences were expected since 
glycopyrronium is renally cleared to a large extent, and they were not considered clinically relevant.


Formoterol
In total, 10277 samples from 652 subjects were included in the population PK analysis of formoterol. The 
final model was a two-compartment model with first-order absorption. Important covariates identified and 
included in the final model were body weight on CL/F and Vc/F (increasing with increasing body weight), 
smoking status on ka (lower for current smokers relative to former smokers) and CL/F (higher for current 
smokers relative to former smokers), and COPD severity on ka (lower for severe or very severe COPD 
relative to mild or moderate COPD). The parameter estimates for the final model, including outliers, are 
provided in Table 33.

Special populations

Effect of age, sex and body weight
The effect of age, sex, and body weight on the PK of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol was 
explored in the population PK analyses.  
 Renal impairment
Specific studies of BGF MDI in subjects with renal impairment have not been conducted.  The effect of renal 
function on the exposure to budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol was evaluated as part of the 
population PK analysis.  Renal function was found not to be a significant covariate in explaining the variability 
of PK parameters for budesonide or formoterol.
For glycopyrronium, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) affected apparent clearance (increasing with 
increasing absolute eGFR).  Based on simulations, a subject having an eGFR of 63.7 mL/min was predicted to 
have AUC increased by 29%, compared with the typical individual (median eGFR 90.0 mL/min).  Additional 
simulations showed that a subject having an eGFR of 45.0 mL/min was predicted to have AUC increased by 
68% (1.55 to 1.82, 90% prediction interval), compared with the typical individual.
 Hepatic impairment
Specific studies of BGF MDI in subjects with hepatic impairment have not been conducted.  Glycopyrronium is 
cleared predominantly from systemic circulation by renal excretion.  Specific data with inhaled budesonide 
and formoterol are not available; however, both are primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism.
 Race
The PK data in two studies in Western subjects (Studies PT010001 and PT010002) were pooled and 
compared to Chinese (Study PT010010) and Japanese (Study PT010003) populations separately and as a 
pooled Asian population. Table 34, Table 35 and Table 36 summarise the comparison results of PK 
parameters of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol, respectively, for the single dose of BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 µg and 160/14.4/9.6 µg in Western, Japanese, and Chinese healthy subjects.


COPD severity
The effect of COPD severity on the PK of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol was explored using a 
population PK analysis methodology. Severity of COPD was found not to be a significant covariate in 
explaining the variability of PK parameters for budesonide or glycopyrronium. For formoterol, COPD severity 
affected ka (lower for severe or very severe COPD relative to mild or moderate COPD). Based on simulations, 
the effect of COPD severity on exposure was modest and not considered to be of clinical relevance for 
formoterol.
Interactions
In vitro data indicate that budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol have a low potential to cause drug-
drug interactions.
The metabolism of budesonide is primarily mediated by CYP3A4. Co-treatment with CYP3A inhibitors, eg, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, are expected to increase exposure.  
At therapeutically relevant concentrations, formoterol does not inhibit the CYP450 enzymes and 
glycopyrronium does not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes.  
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation
Following therapeutic doses of inhaled BGF MDI in COPD patients in study PT010006 (320/14.4/9.6 µg BID 
for 24 weeks), mean±SD AUC0-12 of 2968±1430 pg*h/mL and Cmax of 760±394 pg/mL were observed for 
budesonide. For glycopyrronium, the corresponding values were 88±57 pg*h/mL and 23±16 pg/mL. For 
formoterol, the corresponding values were 65±46 pg*h/ml and 10±7 pg/ml. This corresponds to a mean 
daily AUC of 5936/176/130 pg*h/mL for budesonide, glycopyrronium and formoterol, respectively.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics
No specific pharmacodynamic (PD) studies with BGF MDI formulation were conducted. Two supportive studies 
were conducted that included PD assessments of efficacy with BFF MDI and BD MDI. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Overall, the PK properties of budesonide, glycopyrronium and formoterol in BGF MDI have been adequately 
described in the various studies in healthy volunteers and in COPD patients. 
All studies, except one (Study PT010011), were conducted without charcoal blockade and measured total 
systemic exposure. Therefore, comparable exposure could be accepted as a surrogate for similar safety 
between products but not as supportive of efficacy.
A summary of the important PK comparisons between products is provided below:
1.
BGF MDI vs BFF MDI
BFF MDI was used as a comparator in Phase III studies to demonstrate the contribution of glycopyrronium to 
the efficacy of BGF MDI, although BFF MDI is not authorised in Europe. A direct comparison in healthy 
volunteers of budesonide and formoterol PK parameters between BGF MDI and BFF MDI was conducted in a 
crossover design study, PT010002. In this study, bioequivalence for budesonide and formoterol was 
demonstrated in the presence and absence of glycopyrronium, indicating that glycopyrronium did not alter 
the PK of budesonide or formoterol. 
Study PT010006 provided supportive data that showed comparable, but not bioequivalent, steady-state PK 
between the 2 products during chronic administration in patients with COPD. 
2.
BGF MDI vs GFF MDI
GFF MDI (Bevespi®) was used as a comparator in Phase III studies to demonstrate the contribution of 
budesonide to the efficacy of BGF MDI. A direct comparison in healthy volunteers of glycopyrronium and 
formoterol PK parameters between BGF MDI and GFF MDI was conducted in a crossover design study, 
PT010001. In this study, bioequivalence was demonstrated for formoterol. However, bioequivalence is not 
agreed for glycopyrronium because the applicant specified wider acceptance limits of 67-150%, which were 
not adequately justified.
Study PT010006 provided supportive data that showed comparable, but not bioequivalent, steady-state PK 
between the 2 products during chronic administration in patients with COPD. 
3.
BGF MDI vs Symbicort MDI
This comparison was considered relevant because Symbicort MDI has an extensive safety record, although it 
is not authorised in Europe. Data from Study PT010001 demonstrated bioequivalence for budesonide for the 
high strength products (320 µg). Bioequivalence for formoterol was not demonstrated, with BGF MDI having 
an approximately 27% higher AUC and 20% higher Cmax. 
4.
BGF MDI vs Symbicort TBH
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 104/238
 
 
There is extensive experience with the use of Symbicort TBH® authorised in Europe for the treatment of 
COPD. In study PT010002, bioequivalence for budesonide and formoterol PK parameters between the 2 
products was not demonstrated. 
Study PT010006 provided supportive data and also showed that steady-state PK of budesonide and 
formoterol were not bioequivalent between the 2 products during chronic administration in patients with 
COPD. 
5.
BFF MDI vs BD MDI and FF MDI
BFF MDI was used as a comparator in Phase III studies of BGF MDI to demonstrate the utility of including 
glycopyrronium in the triple combination product. BFF MDI is not authorised. Therefore, to assess BFF MDI as 
being a valid comparator, BFF MDI was compared with the individual components, BD MDI and FF MDI. These 
PK comparisons were conducted in COPD patients in Study PT009001. Bioequivalence for budesonide and 
formoterol was not demonstrated based on conventional acceptance limits, with slightly higher exposure from 
BFF MDI compared to the mono-components. The applicant’s use of expanded acceptance limits (75-133%) 
to demonstrate bioequivalence is not accepted because they were not adequately justified. 
Dose proportionality was demonstrated in the comparison of BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg compared with BGF 
MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg with dose normalised ratios near 100% for both AUC0-12 and Cmax with 90% CI 
contained within 80-125% in the study PT010001 in Western healthy volunteers. Two doses of budesonide 
(160 and 320 μg) were assessed in PK studies in healthy Japanese and Chinese volunteers. Following single 
and repeated dosing, AUC0-12 and Cmax values were generally about 2-fold higher following treatment with 
BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg compared to those reported following treatment with BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg, 
although Cmax in Japanese subjects appeared to be modestly greater than dose proportional. Further 
request from CHMP, the applicant provided appropriate justification allowing to conclude on absence of 
clinical consequences in Japanese subjects.
 No clinically important difference of AUC0-12 of budesonide, glycopyrronium and formoterol were seen 
between the ethnicities (ie, Chinese, Japanese, and Western subjects) after single-dose administration of BGF 
MDI. However, Cmax of glycopyrronium had a decrease (about 30% lower) in Asians compared with Western 
subjects. Further, after multiple-dose administration of BGF MDI, Cmax of glycopyrronium and formoterol 
was lower in Japanese subjects (about 30-40% lower) compared with Chinese subjects. 
The applicant clarified that the total exposure as expressed by AUC0-12 was similar with a ratio between 
Asian and Western populations  of 1.01 for BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg and of 1.19 for BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 
μg. Overall safety profiles for Western and Asian subjects were comparable. 
In study PT010011, approximately half of the subjects had a suboptimal lung deposition without the use of a 
spacer: in these subjects, lung deposition was 2 to 5-fold lower without a spacer as compared to the use with 
spacer.  The use of a spacer did not increase the systemic exposure of budesonide, glycopyrronium and 
formoterol in subjects with an apparently good lung deposition. Also, in patients with COPD participating in 
studies PT10018 and PT010006, several patients had relatively low Cmax (and late Tmax) values suggesting 
suboptimal lung deposition even though in study PT010006, patients who find it difficult to co-ordinate 
actuation with inhalation were excluded from the study and no spacer was used. A suboptimal lung deposition 
is likely to affect the efficacy. SmpC section 5.2 clearly indicates that the use of Trixeo Aerosphere with the 
spacer in healthy volunteers increased the total systemic exposure (as measured by AUC0-t) to budesonide 
and glycopyrronium by 33% and 55%, respectively, while exposure to formoterol was unchanged. In patients 
with good inhalation technique, systemic exposure was not increased with the use of a spacer.

Plots have been generated to examine the relationship between systemic drug exposure, represented by 
Cmax values, and PD response as represented by FEV1 AUC0-12 and Peak FEV1. Linear regression analyses 
were performed for FEV1 AUC0-12 vs. Cmax and Peak FEV1 vs. Cmax. Statistically significant, linear 
relationship was shown for BGF arm at Week 24 between budesonide Cmax (in log scale) and 1) change from 
baseline in FEV1 AUC0-12 (L) 2) change from baseline in Peak FEV1 (L). No statistically significant 
relationship was shown for formoterol and glycopyrronium. It is acknowledged that the number of patients 
who were included in the analysis of PK-PD relationships, is relatively small as compared with the overall 
study population in which efficacy with respect to lung function has been demonstrated. Overall, the popPK 
analyses were conducted adequately. The goodness-of-fit plots for each drug (budesonide, glycopyrronium 
and formoterol) did not suggest any model misspecifications. There were no apparent trends seen in the 
residual plots. The VPCs showed that the median observed concentration-time profiles for each drug were 
captured by their popPK model, although there was a tendency for over-prediction of inter-individual 
variability.
The clinical relevance of the identified covariates in the popPK analyses were assessed through simulation-
based characterisation of their effects on relevant exposure metrics. Considering the planned market dosage 
form (320[160]/18/9.6 μg BGF MDI), none of the covariate effects, for budesonide, glycopyrronium or 
formoterol, were deemed to be clinically relevant. It is acknowledged that the three components of BGF MDI 
are well known and have been previously investigated. However, since this is the first combination proposed 
with these three components combined in a triple inhaler, it is important to fully investigate possible 
covariate effects. As such, the “worst case” sets of covariates simulated for each drug were not the true 
worst-case combinations according to the data sets (i.e. based on min/max values for body weight, age and 
renal function in the analysed population). Instead, they were based on the 10th or 90th percentile of the 
relevant covariate in the data set. 
For budesonide, the lowest weight in the data set was 39.5 kg and highest age was 80 years, whereas weight 
of 57.6 kg and age of 74 years were simulated for the worst case. The applicant has provided further 
simulations using the lowest weight and highest age in the data set, with no clinically relevant effects on 
Cmax or AUC. 
For glycopyrronium, the lowest body weight in the data set was 39.5 kg and the lowest eGFR was 
31.4 mL/min. However, the worst case that was simulated used weight 57.6 kg and eGFR 63.7 mL/min. The 
additional simulations presented, using weight 81.6 kg and eGFR 45 mL/min, showed that Cmin increased by 
1.8-2.2 (90% PI) and AUC increased by 1.6-1.8 (90% PI). To predict the combined effect low body weight 
and low eGFR on glycopyrronium exposure, the applicant has conducted further simulations using the lowest 
values of weight and eGFR in the data set and the SmPC section 5.2 has been adequately updated. 
For formoterol, the lowest body weight in the data set was 36.3 kg, but 58.0 kg was used for simulating the 
worst case. Further simulations using the lowest weight in the data set, the simulated effects of body weight 
on PK parameters were very high in particular for patients with very low body weight, with an ~66 % 
increase in AUC expected. 
Glycopyrronium is eliminated via renal excretion and subjects with impaired renal function are expected to 
have an increased exposure to glycopyrronium. Section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated to state that BGF 
MDI can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. It can also 
be used at the recommended dose in patients with severe renal impairment, including those with end-stage 
renal disease requiring dialysis, if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk as stated in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC. This recommendation is in line with the other inhalation products containing glycopyrronium and is 
acceptable. 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020

Budesonide and formoterol are primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism, thus increased exposure can be 
expected in subjects with severe liver impairment. Section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated to state that 
BGF MDI can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. 
Section 4.2. and 4.4 states that it can also be used at the recommended dose in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment, if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk, and that patients should be monitored for 
potential adverse effects. This recommendation is acceptable by CHMP.
Finally, a thorough QT (TQT) study has not been conducted for BGF MDI. This approach has been adequately 
justified by the applicant.  The TQT data generated with Bevespi is applicable to the glycopyrronium and 
formoterol components of BGF MDI and no evidence that the inclusion of budesonide in BGF MDI would 
changes the risk for cardiac safety, including tachyarrhythmias, as compared to Bevespi MDI. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
Overall, the clinical pharmacology properties of budesonide, glycopyrronium and formoterol with BGF MDI 
have been adequately described.
Study PT009001 evaluated the efficacy and safety of BFF MDI 320/9.6 µg, BFF MDI 160/9.6 µg, and BFF MDI 
80/9.6 µg compared with BD MDI 320 µg and FF MDI 9.6 µg administered BID in subjects with moderate to 
very severe COPD. The data from this study indicated that BFF MDI 320/9.6 µg was the dose which 
warranted further evaluation in subjects with moderate or severe COPD during Phase III. Complete efficacy 
results from this 28-day chronic dosing study are provided in the Clinical Efficacy section.
Study PT008001 was a crossover study that evaluated 28 days of treatment with BD MDI at doses of 320, 
160, 80, and 40 µg compared with Placebo MDI in subjects with mild to moderate persistent asthma. The 
data from this study supported the appropriateness of the 320µg dose of budesonide for COPD in Study 
PT009001. Complete efficacy results from this 4-week chronic dosing study are provided in the Clinical 
Efficacy section.
Pairwise comparisons of treatment groups within a study were performed on log-transformed PK parameters 
using a repeated measure mixed model with treatment, period and sequence as fixed effects and subject as a 
random effect in Study PT010001, Study PT009001, and Study PT010006. This is not in line with the current 
EMA guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence, which specifies that the PK parameters under 
consideration should be analysed by ANOVA with fixed effects for all terms. Furthermore, in some studies 
(PT010001 and PT009001), the applicant predefined wider acceptance limits in order to demonstrate 
bioequivalence. This is not considered acceptable because the wider confidence limits were not adequately 
justified. Further, even if high intra-individual variability was adequately demonstrated, wider limits may be 
applied for Cmax only and not for AUC. Therefore, the applicant’s conclusions of bioequivalence between 
products for these studies are not fully supported. However, given that this application does not relate to an 
application that will be supported by PK studies alone, these issues are not further pursued. The 
demonstration of efficacy will be ultimately based on the phase III clinical data.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy
The applicant performed two pivotal studies to assess efficacy of BGF MDI in patients with moderate to very 
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Study PT010006 was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-
centre study to assess the efficacy and safety of BGF MDI (triple therapy), GFF MDI (Bevespi), and 
BFF MDI compared with Symbicort Turbuhaler as an active control in subjects with moderate to very 
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Study (PT010005), a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, parallel-group study to assess the 
efficacy and safety of BGF MDI (triple therapy) relative to GFF MDI (Bevespi) and BFF MDI on COPD 
exacerbations over a 52-week treatment period in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD.
Aditionally, the applicant provided also the results of a 28-week extension study (Study PT010008).
The main purpose of study PT010008 was the assessment of safety and tolerability in subjects with moderate 
to very severe COPD. The efficacy was investigated through the exploratory endpoints only without any 
hypothesis testing; therefore, this study has a limited value in the context of efficacy assessment.
In addition, the applicant provided 4 studies supporting the use of BFF MDI as a comparator in the pivotal 
studies.
A phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, multi-centre, 24-week study PT009002 was conducted 
to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg and BFF 160/9.6 μg compared with FF 
MDI 9.6 μg and BD MDI 320 μg on lung function (primary endpoints), as well as subject-reported symptom 
outcomes and health status (secondary endpoints). In this study BFF MDI was also compared with Symbicort 
TBH for non- inferiority. 
And a phase III Study PT009003, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, multi-centre, variable length 
efficacy and safety study comparing BFF MDI (320/9.6 μg and 160/9.6 μg) to FF MDI 9.6. The study was 
originally designed as a 52-week COPD lung function and exacerbation study however, the study design was 
modified to be variable length from 12 to 52 weeks.
2.5.1.  Dose response studies
The applicant conducted two studies in the phase 2 development to assess the optimal dose for Budesonide 
(BD) in BFF MDI which was a comparator in the pivotal study for BGF MDI. These studies (PT008001 and 
PT009001) are considered as supportive.
Study PT008001 was a randomised, double-blind, 4-period, 5-treatment, cross-over, multi-centre study in 
which four doses of BD e.g 320, 160, 80 and 40 μg were compared to placebo in patients with mild to 
moderate persistent asthma. 
Study PT009001 was phase IIb randomised, double-blind, chronic dosing (28 days), four-period, five-
treatment, incomplete block, multicentre, crossover study to assess the efficacy and safety of BFF MDI 
320/9.6, 160/9.6, and 80/9.6 μg BID, BD MDI 320 μg BID, and FF MDI 9.6 μg BID in subjects with moderate 
to severe COPD.

2.5.2.  Main studies
The applicant performed two pivotal studies for the efficacy assessment supporting the use of BGF MDI in 
patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.5.2.1.  Study PT10006
Study PT010006 was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-centre 
study to assess the efficacy and safety of BGF MDI (triple therapy), GFF MDI (Bevespi), and BFF MDI 
compared with Symbicort Turbuhaler as an active control in subjects with moderate to very severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease.
Methods
This was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-centre study to assess 
the efficacy and safety of PT010, Bevespi, and BFF MDI compared with Symbicort Turbuhaler as an active 
open-label control in subjects with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Figure 5: Figure; Flow Chart of Study Design 
Study Participants 
The patient population selected for this pivotal study included symptomatic COPD patients (with CAT ≥ 10) 
with moderate to very severe airflow limitation (e.g. with FEV1 ≥25% to <80% predicted normal value). All 
patients had to be current or former smokers.  The entry criteria did not require an exacerbation in the prior 
year therefore the patients enrolled in the study belong to GOLD group B or D based on their symptom 
severity and exacerbation risk. In relation to the background therapy, patients had to be on the stable dose 
of 2 or more inhaled maintenance therapies. However, it is noted that scheduled short-acting β2-agonist 
(SABA) and/or scheduled short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) were also classified as inhaled 
maintenance therapies. Steroid dependent patients on a stable dose of oral steroids (</= 5mg day or </= 10 
every other day) were eligible for enrolment.

The key criteria for exclusion were a diagnosis of asthma (based on medical history and the opinion of the 
Investigator), poorly controlled COPD, i.e. requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids or antibiotics within 6 
weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening) with less than a 4-week washout of corticosteroids and/or antibiotics prior 
to Visit 1 or during the Screening Period (Visit 1 to Visit 4). Other exclusion criteria included clinically 
significant cardiovascular conditions, laboratory abnormalities, narrow-angle glaucoma and risk factors for 
pneumonia. 
Only patients with FEV1 at baseline fulfilling Stability Criteria (FEV1 at Visit 4 had to be within ±20% or 200 
mL of the mean of the pre-dose FEV1 obtained at the 2 preceding visits) could be enrolled to the study. 
Treatments
Study drugs were provided as summarised in Table 37 below:

BFF MDI: Budesonide and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol
There were four arms in this study. BGF MDI (ICS/LABA/LAMA triple therapy) was compared to the 
applicant’s LAMA/LABA dual therapy (Bevespi) and two ICS/LABA combinations (applicant’s BFF MDI and 
Symbicort Turbuhaler). The doses and formulations of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate 
in BGF MDI are the same as those used in the clinical development programs for the dual combinations of 
Budesonide and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol (PT009; hereafter referred to as BFF MDI) and 
Glycopyrronium and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol (PT003; hereafter referred to as GFF MDI and 
also known as Bevespi Aerosphere).
Subjects who were steroid dependent and maintained on an equivalent of up to 5 mg oral prednisone per day 
or up to 10 mg oral prednisone every other day for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 were eligible for

BFF MDI was compared with Symbicort TBH for non-inferiority. The following non-inferiority margins were 
used:  margin of 50 mL for the pre-dose trough FEV1, 75 mL for FEV1 AUC0-4, a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.1 or 
less for the time to Clinically important deterioration (CID), 0.75 puffs/day for the mean change from 
baseline in rescue Ventolin use, 3 points for the SGRQ total score, 1.1 for COPD exacerbation rate, and -1.5 
for RS-Total score. 
Sample size
It was estimated that a sample size of 1800 subjects (600 per arm in the BGF MDI and GFF MDI groups and 
300 per arm in the BFF MDI and Symbicort TBH groups) would provide the following power estimates, all 
assuming Type I error control at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 unless specified otherwise: 
-
-
-
-
99% power to detect a difference of 75 mL between BGF MDI and BFF MDI in FEV1 AUC0-4 over 24 
weeks 
96% power to detect a difference of 35 mL between BGF MDI and GFF MDI in morning pre-dose 
trough FEV1 over 24 weeks, and approximately 92% power over Weeks 12 to 24 
97% power to detect a difference of 50 mL between BGF MDI and BFF MDI in morning pre-dose 
trough FEV1 over Weeks 12 to 24
96% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of BFF MDI to Symbicort TBH in morning pre-dose trough 
FEV1 over 24 weeks, and approximately 92% power over Weeks 12 to 24 based on a margin of 50 
mL (one-sided, alpha=0.025) assuming no true difference. 
Assumptions regarding variability for the primary endpoint were based on the applicant’s experience with 
Phase IIb and III clinical studies. A composite value standard deviation (SD) of 200 mL for the change from 
baseline at each visit was assumed for trough FEV1 and 220 mL for FEV1 AUC0-4. Dropout was anticipated to 
be approximately 12% by the end of the study. Based on the repeated measures (RM) analysis, an effective 
SD for the change over 24 weeks of 157 mL and 173 mL for trough FEV1 and FEV1 AUC0-4, respectively, 
were assumed. For Weeks 12 to 24, an effective SD for trough FEV1 of 171 mL was assumed.

Randomisation
Randomisation was centralised through the use of an IWRS. Subjects were randomised in a 2:2:1:1 scheme. 
Approximately 600 subjects each were randomised to the BGF MDI and GFF MDI treatment groups, and 300 
subjects each were randomised to the BFF MDI and Symbicort TBH treatment groups. Randomisation was 
stratified by reversibility (yes/no) to Ventolin HFA, country, and disease severity as determined by post-
bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1 (≥50%=moderate versus <50%=severe or very severe) to ensure 
even distribution of treatment arms within each stratum.
Blinding (masking)
Study PT010006 was double blinded however only in relation to use of applicant’s products, i.e. BGF MDI, 
GFF MDI and BFF MDI. Symbicort TBH was included as an open-label treatment arm, presumably to allow for 
safety and efficacy comparisons relative to an approved ICS/LABA dual combination.
Statistical methods
Major Study Populations
The ITT Population was defined as all subjects who were randomised to treatment and received any amount 
of the study drug.
The mITT Population was a subset of the ITT Population, and was defined as all subjects with post-
randomisation data obtained prior to discontinuation from study drug. 
Note: The ITT and mITT populations were ultimately identical for this study.
The PP Population was a subset of the ITT population, and was defined as all subjects with post 
randomisation data obtained prior to any major protocol deviations.
The Safety Population was similar to the ITT Population (all subjects who were randomised to treatment and 
received at least 1 dose of the study drug). However, subjects were analysed according to treatment received 
rather than randomised.
Control of Type I error
The comparisons of interest for EU registration are: BGF MDI versus GFF MDI, BGF MDI versus BFF MDI, and 
BGF MDI versus Symbicort TBH, all for superiority, and the comparison of BFF MDI vs. Symbicort for non-
inferiority. All comparisons are evaluated over 24 weeks unless stated otherwise.
Strong control of the Type I error rate was maintained at the 2-sided 0.05 level for the key comparisons 
using a sequential approach for the primary endpoints and then for the secondary measures Type I error 
control was maintained within a particular treatment comparison using a combination of sequential and 
simultaneous approaches as detailed below. 
Hypothesis family 0: Primary endpoints
The following 4 comparisons will be tested in order:
1. FEV1 AUC0-4 for BGF MDI versus BFF MDI using the efficacy estimand
2. Trough FEV1 for BGF MDI versus GFF MDI using the efficacy estimand
3. FEV1 AUC0-4 for BGF MDI versus BFF MDI using the attributable estimand
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 113/238
 
 
4. Trough FEV1 for BGF MDI versus GFF MDI using the attributable estimand 
All subsequent comparisons below will use only the efficacy estimand.
Hypothesis family 1: Comparisons of BGF vs BFF
If the comparison of FEV1 AUC0-4 between BGF MDI and BFF MDI using the attributable estimand above is 
statistically significant, testing will proceed to the secondary comparison of BGF MDI versus BFF MDI for 
change in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 using a 2-sided 0.05 level test. If this test is also significant, testing 
will proceed to the remaining secondary endpoints. BGF MDI versus BFF MDI will be simultaneously compared 
among these secondary endpoints using the Hochberg procedure with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05. 
Hypothesis family 2: Comparisons of BGF vs GFF
 If the comparison of BGF MDI versus GFF MDI for change in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 using the 
attributable estimand is statistically significant, testing will proceed to the remaining secondary endpoints for 
BGF MDI vs. GFF MDI using the efficacy estimand. BGF MDI versus GFF MDI will be simultaneously compared 
among the secondary endpoints using the Hochberg procedure with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05.
Hypothesis family 3: Comparisons of BGF vs Symbicort TBH
If the comparison of FEV1 AUC0-4 for BGF MDI versus BFF MDI is statistically significant using the 
attributable estimand, testing will also proceed to a comparison of BGF MDI versus Symbicort TBH for of 
FEV1 AUC0-4 using the efficacy estimand. If statistically significant, the remaining secondary endpoints for 
BGF MDI versus Symbicort TBH will be simultaneously compared among the secondary endpoints using the 
Hochberg procedure with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05. 
Hypothesis family 4: Comparisons of BFF vs Symbicort TBH
Finally, if the comparison of FEV1 AUC0-4 over 24 weeks for BGF MDI versus BFF MDI is statistically 
significant, testing will proceed to the non-inferiority comparisons of BFF MDI versus Symbicort TBH. If non-
inferiority is established, tests of the additional secondary measures for this comparison will be interpreted 
without any additional control of Type I error. Non-inferiority margins appear throughout the document in 
description and analyses of the endpoints as applicable.

EMA/582495/2020
Page 114/238
 
 
The testing strategy provides strong control of the type I error for each family of hypotheses separately 
(primary endpoints and within each treatment comparison) but not jointly. Importantly, the testing strategy 
does not provide type I error control for the primary endpoints and the SGRQ and/or TDI Focal score across 
both the BGF vs BFF and BGF vs GFF comparisons jointly.
Estimands 
Efficacy estimand 
The primary estimand of interest is called the efficacy estimand and targets the effect of the randomised 
treatments in all subjects assuming continuation of randomised treatments for the duration of the study 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 115/238
 
 
regardless of actual compliance. 
The primary analysis for the efficacy estimand will be conducted using the mITT Population where only data 
obtained prior to subjects discontinuing from randomised treatment will be utilised. This assumes that 
efficacy observed on treatment is reflective of what would have occurred after discontinuation of randomised 
treatment had they remained on treatment.
Attributable estimand
The attributable estimand targets the effect of treatment in subjects attributable to the randomised 
treatment. For this estimand, discontinuation of randomised medication for reasons such as tolerability or 
lack of efficacy are considered unfavorable outcomes.
Analyses of the attributable estimand will be conducted in the mITT Population. Data that are missing due to 
treatment discontinuation will be imputed based on the 5th percentile of the reference arms’ distribution if 
the reason is reasonably attributable to tolerability or lack of efficacy. The 5th percentile applies to an 
endpoint for which a higher value is a better outcome; however, the 95th percentile applies to an endpoint 
for which a lower value is a better outcome. Other missing data are to be imputed using the observed data 
model, i.e. assumed to be missing at random (MAR). The number of imputations used for the derivation of 
the attributable estimand will be between 100 and 1000.
Treatment discontinuations reasonably attributable to tolerability or lack of efficacy will be identified during 
the BDRM (Blinded Data Review Meeting) and documented in the minutes prior to unblinding. 
Discontinuations will be attributed to tolerability if the subject had an adverse event determined by the 
investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug, and for which study drug was 
permanently discontinued. Discontinuations will be attributed to lack of efficacy if ‘lack of efficacy’ is indicated 
to be the primary reason for discontinuation from study drug. For the remaining discontinuation categories, 
decisions will be made and documented at the BDRM. Once these subjects are identified, post-treatment 
discontinuation FEV1 values for each patient will be imputed based on the 5th percentile of the reference 
arms’ distribution.  
Treatment policy
The treatment policy estimand is the effect of randomised treatment over the study period regardless of 
whether randomised treatment is continued. Analyses of the treatment policy estimand will be conducted in 
the ITT Population, in which all observed data will be utilised regardless of whether subjects remain on 
randomised treatment.
Per-protocol 
The per protocol estimand is the effect of treatment on subjects who are compliant with the protocol (i.e. no 
major protocol deviations), including the use of randomised medication.  Analyses of the per-protocol 
estimand will be conducted in the Per-Protocol population.
Statistical Analyses
The change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 will be analysed using a repeated measures 
linear mixed model. The model will include treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, and ICS use at 
Screening as categorical covariates and baseline FEV1, baseline eosinophil count, and percent reversibility to 
Ventolin HFA (HydroFluoroAlkane) as continuous covariates.

EMA/582495/2020

All comparisons were tested for superiority except that the comparison of BFF MDI to Symbicort TBH will be 
for non-inferiority and will use a margin of -50 mL for the lower bound of a 2-sided 95% CI for the treatment 
difference. 
Missing data sensitivity analyses
Missing data sensitivity analyses will be conducted for FEV1 and AUC0-4 to evaluate the robustness of the 
primary analysis findings to missing data.  
Tipping-point analyses was conducted to examine the impact of varying the treatment mean for missing data 
in subjects who discontinue BGF MDI. Multiple imputation (MI) techniques will be used to impute the missing 
data for these patients by varying the mean in the treatment arm. The change from baseline in the treatment 
arm will be decremented by up to 500 mL until the p-value for the comparison of treatment to comparator 
becomes ≥ 0.05. A total of 10 imputations will be used for each set of tipping point analyses.



A separate margin of 75 mL was specified for postdose FEV1 measures
Analyses previously using the mITT Population, the ITT Population, and the PP Population were 
replaced with the Efficacy Estimand and Attributable Estimand, the Treatment Policy Estimand, and 
the PP Estimand, respectively. The new estimand called the Attributable Estimand has been added to 
further evaluate benefit of treatments in the context of having missing data. This Attributable 
Estimand has been added to the Type I error control.
Protocol Deviations
All protocol deviations were reviewed in a blinded manner before database lock, and important deviations 
(related to study eligibility criteria, study conduct, subject management, or subject assessment) were 
identified. Important deviations were further reviewed to determine if they met the definition of a major 
deviation, resulting in exclusion from an analysis set. A total of 108 subjects (5.7%) were excluded from the 
PP Population. 
A total of 108 subjects (5.7%) were excluded from the PP Population (Table 1.3.1). The primary reason for 
exclusion was study drug compliance <70% or >130% (range: 1.7% to 3.0%), followed by use of prohibited 
medications (range: 1.3% to 2.5%). The incidence of other reasons for exclusion from the PP Population was 
low and similar across treatment groups.
Baseline data
A total of 1899 subjects (99.8%) were randomized and treated with study drug, 1634 subjects (86.0%) 
completed 24 weeks of study drug, and 1689 subjects (88.9%) completed the study. No subjects were 
enrolled to this study in the EU. The majority of subjects were enrolled in the US (51.3%), China (22.7%), 
and Japan (21.9%). 
The majority of subjects in the mITT Population were male (71.2%). The mean age was 65.2 years, with the 
majority of subjects in the ≥65 years age group (55.4%).
The majority of subjects were classified as GOLD group B (87.8%). The mean number of exacerbations per 
subject overall was 0.4 and was balanced across the treatment groups. Most subjects (74.4%) had no history 
of a COPD exacerbation in the year prior to Screening. The overall mean total CAT score at baseline was 
18.3.
The majority of subjects in each treatment group had moderate (range: 48.5% to 50.3%) or severe COPD 
(range: 42.4% to 43.4%). 8% of subjects were within very serious disease category 
It is noted that about half of patients in each group had baseline eosinophil count ≥150 cells/mm3. 
A total of 43.4% and 37.5% of subjects were reversible to Ventolin HFA and Atrovent HFA, respectively
Overall, 714 (37.7%), 512 (27.0%), and 375 (19.8%) subjects reported prior COPD-related treatment with 
an ICS/LABA-, ICS/LAMA/LABA-, or LAMA/LABA-containing regimen, respectively. Concomitant other COPD-
related medications were used by generally similar percentages of subjects across the treatment groups 
(range: 18.5% to 24.2%).

Table 40: Overview of Results of Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The comparison of BGF MDI vs GFF MDI for FEV1 AUC0-4 over 24 weeks was not an efficacy endpoint.
The applicant selected two types of primary endpoints for this pivotal study. Both primary endpoints 
investigated lung function.
For trough FEV1 level over 24 weeks BGF MDI demonstrated statistically significant improvements from 
baseline in morning predose trough FEV1 over 24 weeks compared with GFF MDI (LS mean deference was 22 
ml).
For FEV1 AUC0-4 over 24 weeks, BGF MDI was statistically superior as compared to both ICS/LABA 
combinations investigated in the study (e.g BFF and Symbicort TBH). LS mean deference was 104 ml for 
BGF/BFF comparisons and 91 ml for BGF/Symbicort TBH. 
Additional sensitivity analyses were implemented based on a cumulative responder approach.

Rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 24 weeks
The entry criteria did not require an exacerbation in the prior year therefore the percentage of subjects with 
exacerbations in the study was low (severe COPD exacerbations range: 2.7% to 5.3%, moderate COPD 
exacerbations (range: 16.9% to 25.1%).

In study PT010006, the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 24 weeks was analysed as a 
secondary endpoint. In this study, the benefits observed on annualised rate of moderate/severe COPD 
exacerbations over 24 weeks were generally consistent with those observed in study PT010005. 
Improvements compared with GFF MDI were statistically significant. Benefits were observed in subjects 
across all COPD severity categories (moderate, severe, and very severe). 
In relation to Time to First COPD Exacerbation, the risk of first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation was 
nominally significantly lower during treatment with BGF MDI relative to GFF MDI (HR: 0.593; p<0.0001 [Cox 
regression] and p=0.0001 [log rank].
The reduction in the annual rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 24 weeks was higher in 
subjects with a baseline blood eosinophil count of ≥150 cells/mm3 than those with a baseline blood eosinophil 
count of <150 cells/mm3; however, benefits were observed in both eosinophil subgroups.
Improvements in the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 24 weeks between BGF MDI 
versus BFF MDI and BGF MDI versus Symbicort TBH did not reach statistical significance.
TDI focal score over 24 weeks
TDI focal score over 24 weeks was examined as a secondary endpoint for this study. For BGF MDI a 
statistically significant difference in TDI focal score was observed as compared to Symbicort TBH. The MCID 
in TDI focal score is generally accepted to be 1.0 and the observed differences between these groups in the 
study were considerably less. Improvements in TDI focal score between BGF MDI as compared with GFF MDI 
and BFF MDI did not reach statistical significance.  
Change from baseline in SGRQ total score over 24 weeks
BGF MDI as compared to GFF demonstrated a nominally statistically significant improvement in quality of life, 
as measured by the change from baseline in SGRQ total score over 24 weeks (-1.22 units; 
p=0.0259).However, the observed  change from baseline in this score was considerably less than what is 
generally accepted as clinically meaningful (according to the American Society of Thoracic Diseases a mean 
change score of 4 units is associated with slightly efficacious treatment, 8 units for moderately efficacious 
change and 12 units for very efficacious treatment).  No improvements were observed for BGF MDI as 
compared to ICS/LABA dual therapies. 
BGF MDI demonstrated a nominally significant greater percentage of SGRQ responders at Week 24 compared 
with GFF MDI, with a treatment difference of 6.06% (p=0.0395). However, for this endpoint the comparisons 
of BGF MDI vs GFF MDI and BGF MDI vs BFF MDI are included in the Type I error control for the US 
approach, but apparently not for the Japan/China and EU/Canada approaches. 
Change from baseline in average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use over 24 weeks
In relation to change from baseline in average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use over 24 weeks, differences 
between BGF MDI and GFF MDI, BFF MDI, and Symbicort TBH were small (-0.25 puffs/day, -0.24 puffs/day, 
and 0.23 puffs/day, respectively) and not statistically significant.
Other efficacy endpoints are not discussed in this assessment report. 
Ancillary analyses
Subgroup Analyses
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 124/238
 
 
Subgroup analyses were conducted for the following subgroups: country, severity of COPD, GOLD category 
(B or D), reversibility to Ventolin HFA, baseline eosinophil count, race, age, sex, ICS use, post-bronchodilator 
FEV1, and exacerbation history.
The study enrolled patients with moderate to very severe COPD (FEV1 was ≥25% to <80% predicted normal 
value). However, only around 8% of subjects enrolled were within the very severe disease category. The 
majority of patients (89%) were within GOLD class B and only 11% of subject were within class D. 
The subgroup analysis depending on the severity of COPD and GOLD category was performed for lung 
function endpoints only.  The reported results for both respiratory function endpoints (morning predose 
trough FEV1 and FEV1 AUC0-4) were generally consistent across subgroups. BGF MDI as compared to BFF 
MDI and Symbicort TBH significantly improved lung function in all three severity groups. Improvements in 
lung function in BGF MDI group as compared to GFF MDI group was only seen in patients with moderate 
COPD.
Improvements in lung function were seen for all comparisons for patients in GOLD class B whereas for 
patients in GOLD class D, BGF MDI improved lung function only as compared to Symbicort TBH.
The rate moderate to severe exacerbations was significantly lower in the BGF MDI group as compared to the 
GFF MDI group however, only in patients with a history of 0 or 1 exacerbation. The number of patients with a 
history of 2 or more exacerbation was very small (overall 7%) and no treatments effects was seen in this 
subgroup. 
In relation to baseline therapy, the applicant performed a subgroup analysis depending on the ICS use at 
screening (Yes/No). It is noted that there was no difference in Morning Pre-Dose Trough FEV1 between BGF 
MDI versus GFF MDI for those not receiving ICS at screening.
Improvements in LS mean change from baseline in morning predose trough FEV1 for BGF MDI vs GFF MDI 
over Weeks 12 to 24, over 24 weeks, and at Week 24 were driven by subjects with a baseline blood 
eosinophil count of ≥150 cells/mm3. In addition, the differences in exacerbation rates between BGF MDI and 
GFF MDI increased with baseline blood eosinophil levels. The benefits of BGF MDI were apparent beginning at 
blood eosinophil levels between approximately 50 and 100 cells/mm3, a level exceeded by about 75% of 
subjects in this study.
2.5.2.2.  Study PT010005 
PT010005 :  randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
BGF MDI (triple therapy) relative to GFF MDI (Bevespi) and BFF MDI on COPD exacerbations over a 52-week 
treatment period in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD.
Methods
This was a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg BID and BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg BID relative to GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg BID and 
BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg BID over a 52-week Treatment Period in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD 
who had had a history of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations in the 12 months prior to Screening and 
who remained symptomatic (CAT ≥10) while receiving 2 or more inhaled COPD maintenance treatments.

Figure 7: Flow Chart of Study Design 
This study included 2 sub-studies, a 4-hour pulmonary function test (PFT) Sub-study and a 24-hour Holter 
monitoring Sub-study.
Study Participants 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for study PT010005 were similar to those used in study PT010005 with 
the exception of the requirements for having a history of exacerbations in the previous year. 
Study PT010005 only enrolled patients with a history of exacerbations in the previous year and the number 
of required exacerbations depended on the severity of the COPD at baseline i.e. subjects with a post-
bronchodilator FEV1 <50% of predicted normal must have had a documented history of ≥1 moderate or 
severe COPD exacerbation in the 12 months prior to Screening whereas subjects with a post-bronchodilator 
FEV1 ≥50% of predicted normal must have had a documented history of ≥2 moderate exacerbations or a 
documented history of ≥1 severe COPD exacerbation in the 12 months prior to Screening. 
The patient population selected for this pivotal study included symptomatic COPD patients (with CAT > 10) 
with moderate to very severe airflow limitation (e.g. with FEV1 ≥25% to <65% predicted normal value). 
Therefore, patients enrolled in the study belong to GOLD group B or D based on their symptom severity and 
exacerbation risk. In relation to the background therapy, patients had to be on the stable dose of 2 or more 
inhaled maintenance therapies. However, it is noted that scheduled short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) and/or 
scheduled short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) were also classified as inhaled maintenance therapies. 
Steroid dependent patients on a stable dose of oral steroids (</= 5mg day or </= 10 mg other day) were 
eligible for enrolment.
The key criteria for exclusion were a diagnosis of asthma (based on medical history and the opinion of the 
Investigator), poorly controlled COPD, i.e. requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids or antibiotics within 6 
weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening) with less than a 4-week washout of corticosteroids and/or antibiotics prior 
to Visit 1 or during the Screening Period (Visit 1 to Visit 4). Other exclusion criteria included clinically

Use of systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics for at least 3 days; a single depot injectable dose of 
corticosteroids was considered equivalent to a 3-day course of systemic corticosteroids
Exacerbations were considered severe if they resulted in:
o
An inpatient COPD-related hospitalisation (documentation stating that the subject was 
hospitalised for the COPD exacerbation or a record of the subject being admitted for ≥24 
hours to an observation area, the emergency department, or other equivalent healthcare 
facility depending on the country and healthcare system)
o
COPD-related death
Sample size
It was assumed that the average exposure would be 0.83 years and that the rate of moderate or severe 
COPD exacerbations in the BGF MDI 320/18/9.6 μg, BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg, BFF MDI, and GFF MDI 
groups would be 1.142 exacerbations/year, 1.210 exacerbations/year, 1.344 exacerbations/year, and 1.344 
exacerbations/year, respectively, representing relative reductions of 15% for BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg 
compared to both BFF MDI and GFF MDI. It was further assumed that the dispersion parameter k for the 
negative binomial distribution will be 1.05.
Under these assumptions and based on 8,400 subjects randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 μg, BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg, BFF MDI, and GFF MDI, respectively, the probability to 
demonstrate that BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg reduces the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations 
compared to both BFF MDI and GFF MDI was approximately 93% (96% for each comparison) with Type I 
error controlled at a one-sided alpha level of 0.025. The probability to demonstrate differences compared to 
both BFF MDI and GFF MDI with a convincing p-value (<0.005) was approximately 78% (87% for each 
comparison).
Randomisation
Randomisation was centralised through the use of an IWRS. Subjects were randomised to 1 of the 4 
treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified by: exacerbation history (1 or ≥2 moderate 
or severe COPD exacerbations), post-bronchodilator FEV1 (25% to <50% or 50% to 65% predicted), blood 
eosinophil count (<150 cells/mm3 or ≥150 cells/mm3), and country. As of Protocol Amendment 5.0 (Section 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 130/238
 
 
5.8.1), up to a 1:2 ratio for the blood eosinophil strata was targeted, with twice as many randomised 
subjects in the ≥150 cells/mm3 category. 
Blinding (masking)
Study PT010005 was double-blinded. All treatments were blinded in the study. 
Statistical methods
Statistical Analysis Plan
Version 2.0 of the Statistical Analysis Plan was issued on 30 April 2019. Version 2.0 of the Blinded Sample 
Size Reestimation Plan was issued on 29 June 2017. Version 3.0 of the Interim Statistical Analysis Plan was 
issued on 15 August 2017. Version 0.2 of a Supplemental Mortality Analysis Plan was issued on 15 November 
2019.
Changes to the Planned Analyses
Changes included:


Change to the SAP Version 1.0 to Version 2.0 made after interim analysis and before unblinding of 
the final study data
Additional changes per the BDRM minutes prior to unblinding
Additional changes after unblinding
The latter included analysis of time to death (all cause) using a snapshot of supplemental vital status data. In 
accordance with the protocol and informed consent for Study PT010005, vital status was to be collected from 
all randomised subjects at 52 weeks post-randomisation even if the subject discontinued from the study prior 
to the Week 52 visit. A subject’s vital status was considered to have been known at Week 52 if they either 
had a death date or were known to have been alive on or after Day 351.
Analysis Populations
The ITT Population was defined as all subjects who were randomised to treatment and received any 
amount of the study drug. Subjects were to be randomised according to randomised treatment group. 
Efficacy data obtained after discontinuation of treatment, but prior to withdrawal from the study were to be 
included.
The mITT Population was a subset of the ITT Population, and was defined as all subjects with post-
randomisation data obtained prior to discontinuation from study drug. Any data obtained after completion of 
or discontinuation from the study treatment will be excluded from the mITT analysis. Subjects were to be 
analysed according to randomised treatment group. The mITT population will be the primary population for 
all efficacy analyses except for the non-inferiority analyses.
The PP Population was a subset of the mITT population and was defined as all subjects with 
postrandomisation data obtained prior to any major protocol deviations.
The Safety Population was similar to the mITT Population (all subjects who were randomised to treatment 
and received at least 1 dose of the study drug). However, subjects were to be analysed according to 
treatment received rather than randomised. If a subject received more than one randomised treatment, they 
were to be analysed and included in summaries according to the treatment they received the most.
Multiple testing strategy
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020

All comparisons were tested for superiority, with the exception of BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg MDI to BFF. The 
comparisons of BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg to BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg on COPD exacerbations will be for non-
inferiority followed by superiority; however, attaining statistical significance in the superiority comparison was 
not a pre-requisite to proceeding down the testing hierarchy.
If BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg significantly reduced the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations 
compared to both GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg and BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg (using first the efficacy estimand and then 
the attributable estimand, which is a secondary endpoint), then primary endpoints from the lung function 
sub-study were to be assessed. These are first FEV1 AUC0-4 over 24 weeks for the comparison of BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 μg to BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg and then the change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 
over 24 weeks for the comparison of BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg to GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg. If these comparisons 
were statistically significant, the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations in the baseline exacerbation 
history ≥ 2 exacerbations in the last year category was to be compared between BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg 
and GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg and between BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg and BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg, 
BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg was to follow a similar approach, except that the comparison to BFF 320/9.6 μg 
was to be for non-inferiority first. If BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg significantly reduced the rate of moderate or 
severe COPD exacerbations compared to GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg and was non-inferior to BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg, 
then primary endpoints from the lung function sub-study were to be assessed as outlined above.
Estimands 
Efficacy estimand 
The primary estimand of interest is called the efficacy estimand and targets the effect of the randomised 
treatments in all subjects assuming continuation of randomised treatments for the duration of the study 
regardless of actual compliance. 
The primary analysis for the efficacy estimand will be conducted using the mITT Population where only data 
obtained prior to subjects discontinuing from randomised treatment will be utilised. This assumes that 
efficacy observed on treatment is reflective of what would have occurred after discontinuation of randomised 
treatment had they remained on treatment.
Attributable estimand
The attributable estimand targets the effect of treatment in subjects attributable to the randomised 
treatment. For this estimand, discontinuation of randomised medication for reasons such as tolerability or 
lack of efficacy are considered unfavorable outcomes.
Analyses of the attributable estimand will be conducted in the mITT Population using a bootstrapped multiple 
imputation approach. Data that are missing due to treatment discontinuation will be imputed based on the 
5th percentile of the reference arms’ distribution if the reason is reasonably attributable to tolerability or lack 
of efficacy. The 5th percentile applies to an endpoint for which a higher value is a better outcome; however, 
the 95th percentile applies to an endpoint for which a lower value is a better outcome. Other missing data 
are to be imputed using the observed data model, i.e. assumed to be missing at random (MAR). 
Treatment discontinuations reasonably attributable to tolerability or lack of efficacy will be identified during 
the BDRM and documented in the minutes prior to unblinding. Once these subjects are identified, post-
treatment discontinuation FEV1 values for each patient will be imputed based on the 5th percentile of the 
reference arms’ distribution.  
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 132/238
 
 
Treatment policy
The treatment policy estimand is the effect of randomised treatment over the study period regardless of 
whether randomised treatment is continued. Analyses of the treatment policy estimand will be conducted in 
the ITT Population, in which all observed data will be utilised regardless of whether subjects remain on 
randomised treatment.
Per-protocol 
The per protocol estimand is the effect of treatment on subjects who are compliant with the protocol (i.e. no 
major protocol deviations), including the use of randomised medication.  Analyses of the per-protocol 
estimand will be conducted in the Per-Protocol population.
Statistical Analyses
Analysis of the primary endpoint – rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations 
The rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations was to be analysed using negative binomial regression. 
Treatments were to be compared adjusting for baseline post-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1 and log 
baseline blood eosinophil count as continuous covariates, and baseline COPD exacerbation history, region and 
ICS use at screening as categorical covariates.  For the non-inferiority comparison of BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 
μg MDI to BFF, a non-inferiority ratio of 1.1 was to be employed.
For the efficacy estimand and per-protocol estimand, the time at risk was defined as the amount of time 
between the date of first dose of study medication and the date of premature discontinuation from study 
medication (plus one day) or the date of completion of study medication minus the number of days while the 
subject was experiencing any exacerbation and minus the seven days subsequent to any exacerbation..
For the attributable estimand, the time at risk was defined as time of exposure or post-exposure not during 
or immediately subsequent to an actual or imputed exacerbation –or 1 year after the date of first dose (for 
subjects who have not completed treatment). 
For the treatment policy estimand, time at risk was defined as follow-up time – not during or within 7 days 
after an exacerbation (of equal or greater severity) – up to the last recorded date (of any assessment or 
contact) for the subject (including telephone contact). However, the start day of a COPD exacerbation was 
not to be excluded from the time at risk. 
Analyses will be conducted on the mITT Population for the efficacy estimand and attributable estimand, on 
the ITT Population for the treatment policy estimand, and on the PP Population for the per-protocol estimand. 
Analyses of the efficacy and treatment policy estimands use only observed data while the attributable 
estimand requires imputation.
Handling of missing data
For the analysis of the attributable estimand, missing data that have been reasonably attributed to 
tolerability or lack of efficacy were to be imputed based on the 95th percentile of the reference arms’ 
distribution. The imputed value (using a bootstrap approach with maximum likelihood developed by von 
Hippel) was to be drawn from a negative binomial distribution with mean exacerbation rate (and variance) 
based on the 95th percentile of the reference arms’ distribution, with estimates set to the average of 
estimates for the two reference treatments from the primary analysis. Other missing data were to be imputed 
using the observed data model, i.e. assumed to be missing at random (MAR) or missing completely at 
random (MCAR). Missingness considered to be attributable will be identified during the BDRM process.

Table 45: Sensitivity Analyses for Rate of Moderate or Severe COPD Exacerbations
Tipping-point analyses were to be conducted to examine the impact of varying the rate parameter for missing 
data in subjects who discontinue BGF MDI. Multiple imputation (MI) techniques were to be used to impute the 
missing data for these patients by varying the exacerbation rate in the BGF MDI arm. The rate in the BGF 
MDI arm was to be increased until the p-value for the comparison of treatment to comparator becomes ≥ 
0.05 or until the rate was increased by 1.5 exacerbations/year. A total of 10 imputations was to be used for 
each set of tipping point analyses. This imputation technique was to be applied in sensitivity analyses. 
Analysis of primary endpoints of lung function study – FEV1 AUC0-4 over 24 weeks and change from baseline 
in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 over 24 weeks
These endpoints were to be analysed in a similar manner as in study PT010005.
Analysis of secondary endpoint – All cause mortality within 52 weeks
Time to death (all cause) in weeks was to be summarised using a Kaplan-Meier curve.

Conduct of the study
Baseline data
A total of 8573 subjects (99.8%) were randomised and treated with study drug, and 6654 subjects (77.6%) 
completed 52 weeks of treatment with study drug. A total of 533 subjects overall (6.2%) discontinued from 
study drug but completed the study. Of these 533 subjects, the percentage of subjects who discontinued 
from study drug was lowest in the BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg group (19.4%) followed by the BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 μg (20.4%), BFF MDI (23.0%), and GFF MDI (25.6%) groups. The most frequent reasons 
subjects discontinued from study drug overall included AEs (517 subjects [6.1%]), lack of efficacy (512 
subjects [6.0%]), and subject discretion (451 subjects [5.3%]).
The majority of subjects in the mITT Population were white (84.9%), male (59.7%), and not Hispanic or 
Latino (78.8%). The mean age was 64.7 years with 52.1% of subjects in the ≥65 years age group.
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 136/238
 
 
Overall, 58.9% of subjects were former smokers and 41.1% were current smokers, and the mean smoking 
history was 47.6 pack-years. Overall, the percentage of subjects with a blood eosinophil count ≥150 
cells/mm3 (59.9%) was greater than for subjects with a blood eosinophil count <150 cells/mm3 (40.0%) at 
baseline and was similar across the treatment groups. 
The overall mean total CAT score at baseline was 19.6 and was similar across the treatment groups. 95% of 
patients had CAT score ≥10. 
As discussed in the study there was a requirement for having a history of exacerbation on the previous year. 
Overall, 56.5% of subjects had a history of ≥2 moderate or severe COPD exacerbations occurring in the 12 
months prior to screening, including during the Screening Period.
A total of 21.2% of subjects (range: 20.2% to 21.8%) had a history of at least 1 severe COPD exacerbation 
(ie, hospitalised or received emergency room [urgent care centre] treatment).
Therefore, it seems that the majority of patients enrolled to this study were within the GOLD group D. 
The majority of subjects in each treatment group had severe COPD (59.9% to 61.1%); the remainder of 
subjects with available data had moderate (range: 28.1% to 28.8%) or very severe COPD (range: 10.2% to 
11.6%). 
A total of 30.7% and 29.0% of subjects were reversible to Ventolin HFA and Atrovent HFA, respectively 
Overall, 2667 (31.3 %), 3358 (39.4%), and 1184 (13.9 %)subjects reported prior COPD-related treatment 
with an ICS/LABA-, ICS/LAMA/LABA-, or LAMA/LABA-containing regimen, respectively.

administered twice daily (BID), in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD.
Methods
Figure 14: Study Design
As the application is a triple inhaler BG MDI, this study is intended to support a dual combination of BFF and 
aims to demonstrate the relative contribution of each mono component as well as demonstrate non inferiority 
to an active comparator.  The trial was relatively short (26 weeks). It needs to be highlighted that Symbicort 
TBH was an open label treatment and this limits its value as a comparator in this study.

Sample size
It was estimated that a sample size of 2420 subjects (660 per arm in the BFF MDI and FF MDI groups and 
220 per arm in the BD MDI and Symbicort® TBH groups) will provide power estimates as summarised in the 
table below. All calculations assume Type I error control at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 and 20% dropout 
rate.
Table 51:Power Estimates
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 149/238
 
 
Assumptions regarding variability for the primary endpoints are based on the applicant’s experience with 
Phase IIb and III clinical studies. A standard deviation (SD) of 200 mL for the change from baseline at each 
visit has been assumed for trough FEV1 and 220 mL for FEV1 AUC0-4. Based on the repeated measures 
analysis and anticipated dropout of approximately 20%, an effective SD for the change over 24 weeks of 157 
mL and 200 mL for trough FEV1 and FEV1 AUC0-4, respectively, is assumed. For Weeks 12 to 24, an 
effective SD for the change in trough FEV1 of175 mL is assumed.
The non-inferiority margin of 50 mL for the evaluation of pre-dose trough FEV1 represents the approximate 
anticipated treatment effect in this endpoint. The non-inferiority margin of 75 mL for the evaluation of FEV1 
AUC0-4 represents a value less than the anticipated treatment effect in this endpoint.
Randomisation
Randomisation was centralised through the use of an IWRS. Subjects were randomised in a 3:3:3:1:1 
scheme. Approximately 660 subjects each were planned to be randomised to the BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg, BFF 
MDI 160/9.6 μg, and FF MDI 9.6 μg treatment groups, and 220 subjects each were planned to be randomised 
to the BD MDI 320 μg and Symbicort TBH treatment groups. Randomisation was stratified by reversibility 
(yes/no) to Ventolin HFA, post-bronchodilator FEV1 (<50% or 50% to <80% predicted, measured at Visit 2), 
blood eosinophil count (<150 or ≥150 cells/mm3), and country.
Study personnel had access to the IWRS, which allocated subjects to a treatment sequence, assigned 
subjects to drug, and managed the distribution of clinical supplies. Clinical supplies were packaged according 
to a component schedule. Each person accessing the IWRS system was assigned an individual unique 
personal identification number.
Blinding (masking)
The investigators were allowed to unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in the case of an 
emergency, when knowledge of the study treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or 
welfare of the subject.
Statistical methods
The statistical methods used in this study were similar to those used in the pivotal study, PT010006.
As in study PT010006, four estimands of interest were defined for this study: Efficacy, Attributable, 
Treatment Policy, and Per Protocol. The Efficacy Estimand was identified as primary for the testing of 
superiority of one treatment versus another. 
There were 5 pairwise comparisons of treatments of interest: BFF MDI (2 doses: 320/9.6 μg and 160/9.6 μg) 
vs FF MDI, BFF MDI (2 doses: 320/9.6 μg and 160/9.6 μg) vs BD MDI, and BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg vs Symbicort 
TBH. 
Estimation results were provided by randomised treatment and for each treatment difference for all 
comparisons, in each estimand. All comparisons were performed for testing superiority except that the 
comparison of BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg to Symbicort TBH was for non-inferiority. Non-inferiority analyses used 
the Per Protocol Estimand, which was the effect of treatment on subjects who were compliant with the 
protocol, unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 150/238
 
 
Non-inferiority comparisons used a margin of 50 mL for the pre-dose trough FEV1 and 75 mL for FEV1 AUC0-
4.
Additional sensitivity analyses were implemented based on a cumulative responder approach for the change 
from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 at 24 weeks (US) and over 24 weeks (EU) and change from 
baseline in FEV1 AUC0-4 over 24 weeks (EU) and at Week 24 (US).
Results
Participant flow
Figure 15: Flow Chart of Subject Disposition
Recruitment
A total of 4,242 subjects were screened at 253 centres.  A total of 2,389 subjects were randomised; 2,370 
subjects (99.2%) were treated with study drug, and 2,057 subjects (86.1%) completed 24 weeks of 
treatment with study drug.
Conduct of the study
There were two protocol amendments. These amendments were made after the start of subject recruitment. 
The main changes  as a part of second amendment included adding  COPD exacerbations to the list of 
secondary objectives. In addition it was clarified that that the Efficacy Estimand was the primary analysis for 
superiority, the Per Protocol Estimand was the primary analysis for non-inferiority, the Attributable Estimand 
Assessment report

was a secondary analysis, and the Treatment Policy Estimand was a supportive analysis. Finally, it was non-
inferiority comparisons to Symbicort TBH were only performed for BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg.  
Protocol Deviations
All protocol deviations were reviewed in a blinded manner before database lock, and important deviations 
(related to study eligibility criteria, study conduct, subject management, or subject assessment) were 
identified. Important deviations were further reviewed to determine if they met the definition of a major 
deviation, resulting in exclusion from an analysis set. The most common major deviation was study drug dose 
out of window (12±2 hours), reported in 1053 subjects (44.1%) 
Baseline data
Baseline data: Demographics
The majority of subjects in the mITT Population were white (96.6%), male (60.5%), and not Hispanic or 
Latino (96.8%). The mean age was 64.3 years with the majority of subjects in the ≥65 years age group 
(52.1%). Demographic characteristics were balanced across the treatment groups.
Overall, 49.0% of subjects had used ICS at screening, and all subjects were either former (46.9%) or current 
(53.1%) smokers; the mean smoking history was 44.9 pack-years.
Other Baseline and Disease Characteristics
Few subjects changed smoking status over the course of the study and the incidence was similar across 
treatment groups: 17 subjects (0.7%) switched from former smoker to current smoker and 34 subjects 
(1.4%) switched to non-smoker from current smoker after starting study drug.
The overall mean total CAT score at baseline was 20.2 and was similar across the treatment groups; most of 
the subjects (81.9%) had a CAT score ≥15 at baseline.
The percentage of subjects overall with an eosinophil count ≥150 cells/mm3 and <150 cells/mm3 at baseline 
was 65.7% and 34.3%, respectively, and was similar across the treatment groups. Baseline exacerbation 
history was also similar across the treatment groups. There was no requirement for a history of COPD 
exacerbation, and overall, most subjects (72.9%) had no history of a COPD exacerbation in the year prior to 
screening.
COPD Disease Severity, and GOLD Category
The majority of subjects in each treatment group had moderate (range: 58.1% to 59.7%) or severe COPD 
(36.9% to 39.2%). Only a small percentage of patients were within very severe COPD category.  The 
majority of subjects were classified as GOLD group B (90.0%)
In line with the FDC guidelines, superiority or ‘add on efficacy’ can only be claimed to active substances to 
which patients have been demonstrated to be responding insufficiently. In addition, the contribution of each 
component needs to be shown. For the purposes of the trial it is agreed that the dual inhalation therapy is 
compared to each of the mono components however budesonide as a monotherapy would not be appropriate 
in clinical practice.
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 152/238
 
 
The trial examined dual versus monotherapy as the intention of the study was to build support for BFF MDI 
as an appropriate comparator in the pivotal phase 3 study. BFF MDI was also compared to Symbicort TBH 
however, as this was an open label treatment value of this comparison is limited.
COPD-related Medications
Overall, 435 (18.4%), 978 (41.4%), and 15 (0.6%) subjects reported prior COPD-related treatment with a 
LAMA/LABA-, an ICS/LABA-, or an ICS/LAMA/LABA-containing regimen, respectively, for at least 30 days 
prior to screening.

Time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (Efficacy Estimand; mITT Population)
In the secondary endpoints, both strengths of BFF MDI showed superiority over FF 9.6 µg in time to first 
exacerbation which were statistically significant (the better results for the higher dose).
The higher strength 320/9.6 µg. comparison to BD 320 µg monotherapy was not statistically significantly. 
In comparison to Symbicort the HR was in numerically favour for Symbicort for both strengths (1.198 and 
1.368 for high and low strengths BFF).
Both BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg and BFF MDI 160/9.6 μg demonstrating nominally significant improvement in the 
rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations compared with FF MDI (rate ratio=0.63; p=0.0005 and rate 
ratio=0.72; p=0.0094, respectively). 
But in comparison to Symbicort both strengths seem to be numerically inferior for BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg (rate 
ratio 1.36 and P value 0.1619) and statistically inferior for BFF MDI 160/9.6 (rate ratio 1.54 and P value 
0.0481).
Numeric differences in the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations for BFF MDI 160/9.6 over BD MDI 
were not significant. The higher strength BFF MDI 320/9.6 was better than BD MDI.
Percentage of Subjects Achieving an MCID of ≥4 Units in SGRQ Total Score
In relation to the SGRQ, non-inferiority of BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg to Symbicort TBH in the number of SGRQ 
responders was not demonstrated, as the 95% CI was not within the pre-specified non inferiority margin of 
10% (difference [95% CI]=-2.00 [-10.18, 6.19] mL) using the Per Protocol Estimand.  The lower strength 
BFF MDI 160/9.6 μg had a lower % difference of -1.33 and therefore could lie within the predefined lower 
limit. 
Peak change from baseline in FEV1
Peak change from baseline in FEV1 at (US) or Over (EU) 24 weeks was greatest for the higher strength Both 
BFF MDI 320/9.6. Both dual BFF MDI were similar to Symbicort and the differences to FF MDI 9.6 μg were 
not clinically relevant.
Average Daily Rescue Ventolin HFA Use
The change from baseline in average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use over 24 weeks was similar between both 
BFF dual inhalers at -1.3 puffs/day and similar to Symbicort -1.2, followed by FF MDI 9.6 μg and BD MDI 320 
μg -0.6. The onset of action for all FF containing groups had an LS mean change from baseline of ≥120 mL 
by 5 minutes. Some patients especially with milder COPD will have a degree of reversibility so having a rapid 
onset of action can lead to improvements in dyspnoea.
Time to CID
The applicant also measured time to a clinical important deterioration (CID) which was a composite of 100ml 
decrease in trough FEV1, or ≥4 point increase in SGRQ total score or a TDI focal score of 1 point or less, or a 
treatment emergent moderate or severe COPD exacerbation up to week 24. The best results were achieved 
by Symbicort as they had the lowest % pf patients at 66.2% followed by BFF 320/9.6 μg (73.4%) > BFF MDI 
160/9.6 μg (77.6%) > FF MDI 9.6 μg (78.7%) > BD MDI 320 μg (81.1%).
The median time to events was longest for Symbicort at 12 weeks followed by 8.4 (BFF 320/9.6 μg) 8.1 (BFF 
MDI 160/9.6 μg), 7.6 (FF MDI 9.6 μg) and 5.2 (BD MDI 320 μg).
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 156/238
 
 
Therefore, it appears that the combination BFF 320/9.6 μg overall performs better than the lower BFF MDI 
strength and each of the monocomponents and appears to be non-inferior to Symbicort on lung function but 
did not demonstrate non-inferiority for CID and time to first moderate or severe exacerbation
TDI Focal Score
Improvements from baseline in adjusted mean TDI focal score were observed for all treatment groups 
through Week 24. Numerical higher results were seen for the BFF MDI 160/9.6 μg, (1.20) followed by BFF 
320/9.6 μg (1.12) and both were non-inferior to Symbicort (1.07).
Ancillary analyses
Subgroup analyses
For the endpoints of morning pre-dose trough FEV1, FEV1 AUC0-4, and the rate of moderate or severe COPD 
exacerbations, BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg and BFF MDI 160/9.6 μg showed improvements relative to both FF MDI 
and BD MDI for subjects with and without a history of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. For both BFF 
MDI 320/9.6 μg and BFF MDI160/9.6 μg, the results were consistent when assessed at Week 24 (morning 
pre-dose trough FEV1 and FEV1 AUC0-4) and over 24 weeks.
Overall the BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg achieved more efficacious results compared to the lower BFF MDI 160/9.6 
μg, non-inferiority was demonstrated to Symbicort on the primary endpoints for the higher strength BFF MDI 
320/9.6 μg.  However, the clinical relevance for the AUC04 over 24 weeks is questioned and the endpoints 
therefore not in line with the current COPD guideline.
In comparison to Symbicort for the rate and time to exacerbations and time to CID non-inferiority was not 
demonstrated for both dual strength MDI’s. 
Study PT009003
This was a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, multi-centre, variable length efficacy and 
safety study comparing BFF MDI (320/9.6 μg and 160/9.6 μg) to FF MDI 9.6 μg administered twice daily 
(BID), in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD.
Methods
Eligible subjects must have had a history of COPD exacerbations and remained symptomatic, as measured by 
the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), while receiving 1 or more inhaled maintenance bronchodilators.

Figure 16: Flow Chart of Study Design
The study was originally designed as a 52-week COPD lung function and exacerbation study with a patient 
population enriched to increase the probability of observing COPD exacerbations. The study design was 
modified based on regulatory feedback. In the revised design, the study was planned to end when the last 
remaining randomised subject completed 12 weeks on randomised treatment or completed the Final Study 
Visit.
Study Participants 
This study included men and women between 40 and 80 years of age at Visit 1, with a history of at least 10 
pack-years of cigarette smoking. Subjects had an established clinical history of COPD as defined by the 
American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society or by locally applicable guidelines. Subjects must 
have been symptomatic (CAT score ≥10) while receiving 1 or more inhaled bronchodilators as maintenance 
therapy for the management of their COPD for at least 6 weeks prior to Visit 1.
Subjects must also have had a documented history of at least 1 moderate or severe COPD exacerbation in 
the previous 12 months. At Visit 1, all subjects were required to have a FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio 
of <0.70 and an FEV1 of <80% predicted normal value. 
At Visit 2, all subjects were required to have a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of <0.70 and a post-
bronchodilator FEV1 of ≥25% to <80% predicted normal value. 
At Visit 3, the averages of subjects’ -60 min and -30 min pre-dose FEV1 assessments were required to have 
been <80% predicted normal value. Subjects who were being treated with prohibited COPD medications at 
Visit 1 were required to discontinue these medications, observe the minimum washout requirement before 
returning for Visit 2, and not use these medications throughout the course of the study.

Patients excluded from the study had a current diagnosis of asthma, COPD due to α1-antitrypsin deficiency, 
other respiratory disorders such as cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary HT. Patients with active 
upper or lower respiratory tract infections or who required long term oxygen therapy (≥15 hours a day) 
were excluded

• Time to first clinically important deterioration in COPD 
• Change from baseline in average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use over 12 weeks (over 24 weeks 
• Percentage of subjects achieving an MCID of 4 units or more in Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire 
(SGRQ) total score over 24 weeks 
• Change from baseline in the Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT) total score over 
the treatment period 
• Transient Dyspnoea Index (TDI) focal score over 24 weeks 
The objectives and endpoints are somewhat similar to study PT009002 as the study compared both strengths 
of BFF MDI to FF MDI. However only a single primary endpoint was used in this study without an active 
comparator. Amendment 2 Changed the first primary objective “to assess the effects of BFF MDI relative to 
FF MDI on COPD exacerbations” to be a secondary objective of the study. The rationale for this was to align 
with the change on focus of the study from a lung function and exacerbation study to a lung function study in 
which at least a numerical trend in COPD exacerbations will be demonstrated. 
Sample size
Sample size calculation for original primary endpoint
With a randomised total sample size of 2,241 subjects, the power to demonstrate that BFF
MDI reduces the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations compared to FF MDI is approximately 93%, 
with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. The power of the same analysis with a two-sided alpha level of 0.01 is 
approximately 80%.
For the analysis of morning pre-dose trough FEV1 at Week 24 (US Regulatory Approach) or over 24 weeks 
(ex-US Regulatory Approach), the proposed sample size of 2,241 subjects with 20% dropout will provide 
93% or 99% power, respectively, to detect a difference of 40 mL between BFF MDI and FF MDI. The Type I 
error will be controlled at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.
A blinded sample size re-estimation (BSSR) was conducted to assess the sample size assumptions.
Sample size calculation for revised primary endpoint
For morning pre-dose trough FEV1, assumptions regarding variability are based on Pearl’s experience with 
Phase IIb and III clinical studies. The expected standard deviation (SD) for the change from baseline at each 
visit is 200 mL. The expected SD over 24 weeks is 158 mL with a correlation of 0.55 over the six post-
randomisation visits to Week 24.  
For the analysis of morning pre-dose trough FEV1 over 24 weeks (the ex-US Approach) with 30% dropout, 
the proposed sample size of 1,860 subjects will provide approximately 96% power to detect a difference of 
40 mL between BFF MDI and FF MDI. The Type I error will be controlled at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
Randomisation
Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
Randomisation was centralised using an IWRS. Subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1 scheme.
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 160/238
 
 
Approximately 620 subjects each were randomised to the BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg, BFF MDI
160/9.6 μg, and FF MDI 9.6 μg treatment groups. Randomisation was stratified by exacerbation history (1 or 
≥2 moderate or severe exacerbations), post-bronchodilator FEV1 (25% to < 50% predicted or 50% to <80% 
predicted), blood eosinophil count (<150 cells/mm3 or ≥150 cells/mm3), and country. Enrolment was 
targeted to achieve a 2:1 ratio for the blood eosinophil strata with twice as many randomised subjects in the 
≥150 cells/mm3 category.
Blinding (masking)
This was a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study.
Statistical methods
Statistical methods
Primary Efficacy Analysis: Morning Pre-dose Trough FEV1
Change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 was to be analysed using a linear repeated measures 
ANCOVA model. The model will include treatment, visit, and treatment by visit interaction, and ICS use at 
Screening as categorical covariates and baseline FEV1 and blood eosinophil count at Screening, and percent 
reversibility to Ventolin HFA as continuous covariates. Two-sided p-values and point estimates with two-sided 
95% confidence intervals will be produced for each treatment difference. The analysis will be conducted using 
the mITT Population where only data obtained prior to subjects discontinuing from randomised treatment will 
be utilised.  Supportive Analyses: Analyses will also be conducted in the ITT Population where all observed 
data will be utilised regardless of whether subjects remain on randomised treatment. The use of this 
population will provide an estimate of the treatment strategy effectiveness. Analyses will also be conducted in 
the Per Protocol (PP) Population.
Sensitivity analyses exploring the potential impact of missing data will be conducted for both the mITT and 
ITT Populations.
Secondary Efficacy Analysis: Secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted in the mITT, ITT, and PP 
Populations.
The Type I error rate was controlled within the primary and secondary efficacy analyses. Two different 
strategies were used (US and Ex US strategies). As a general strategy for each regulatory approach, the Type 
I error rate will be strongly controlled within the family of primary analyses. Although the Type I error rate 
will also be strongly controlled within each family of secondary analyses, the overall Type I error rate will not 
be controlled across all primary and secondary analyses and dose levels.  (Finbarr).
The Efficacy Estimand was the primary estimand of interest for all superiority comparisons.
In order to address missing data, an Attributable Estimand was also defined where unfavorable outcomes 
were imputed for missingness judged to be potentially related to randomised treatment. Data collected 
following treatment discontinuation were included in the Treatment Policy Estimand.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted for change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough
FEV1 to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis findings to missing data. Robustness of results to 
missing data was explored using tipping point analysis. Additional sensitivity analyses were implemented

based on a cumulative responder approach as described in Farrer et al (Farrar 2006). Sensitivity analyses are 
only discussed in text for the primary efficacy endpoint.
The multiple testing strategy provides strong control of the type 1 error for the primary analyses across 
doses. The multiple testing strategy also provides strong control for specified families of secondary 
hypotheses within BFF MDI dose levels, including control across the primary and key symptom and quality of 
life measures within dose level. The testing strategy does not provide strong control of the type I error level 
for the secondary endpoints across doses.
Results
Participant flow
1876 subjects randomised at 259 centres, 1864 (99.4 %) subjects were treated.  A total of 1625 (86.6%), 
1123 (59.9%), and 192 (10.2%) subjects completed 12, 24, and 52 weeks, respectively, of treatment with

Table 56: Subject Disposition (All Subjects Randomised)
The most frequent reasons subjects discontinued treatment with study drug were lack of efficacy (150 
[8.1%] subjects), AEs (81 [4.4%] subjects), and subject discretion (81 [4.4%] subjects). Lack of efficacy 
was a more frequent reason for treatment discontinuation in the FF MDI treatment group (11.5%) compared 
with the BFF MDI treatment groups (6.5% in each).

Other Baseline and Disease Characteristics
Overall, the majority of subjects had used ICS at screening (76.3%) and all subjects were either former 
(60.7%) or current (39.3%) smokers; the mean smoking history was 45.0 pack years.
The other baseline characteristics were similar among the treatment groups.
The overall mean total CAT score at baseline was 21.4 and was similar across the treatment groups; most 
(85.1%) subjects had a CAT score ≥15 at baseline. The percentage of subjects with an eosinophil count ≥150 
cells/mm3 and <150 cells/mm3 at baseline was 67.2% and 32.7%, respectively, and similar across the 
treatment groups. Baseline exacerbation history was also similar across the treatment groups. Most subjects 
had a history of 1 COPD exacerbation in the year prior to screening (61.1%).
The mean duration of COPD was similar across the treatment groups, ranging from 7.7 to 8.1 years. The 
majority of subjects in each treatment group had moderate (range: 52.9% to 54.6%) or severe COPD 
(37.3% to 40.2%). Approximately half of subjects were GOLD Group B (48.8% to 51.7%) and approximately 
half were GOLD Group D (47.9% to 51.2%).
Reversibility to Ventolin HFA
Reversibility to Ventolin HFA for the mITT Population is summarised.  Across all subjects, the mean increase 
for FEV1 from pre- to post-Ventolin HFA was 137.3 mL (12.7%).
A total of 27.0% of subjects were reversible to Ventolin HFA, defined as at least both a 12% and a 200 mL 
increase from pre-Ventolin HFA in FEV1, and reversibility was generally similar across treatment groups.
COPD-Related Medications: Concomitant COPD-related medications were used by low and similar 
percentages of subjects across the treatment groups (range: 18.1% to 21.4%) and the most commonly used 
concomitant COPD-related medications were oxygen (range: 2.7% to 4.0%), salbutamol (range: 2.1% to 
4.0%), and budesonide (range: 1.8% to 2.6%).
Numbers analysed
Overall, 1843 subjects were randomised to study drug and received any amount of study drug and were 
included in the ITT and Safety Populations; of these, all had post-randomisation data obtained prior to 
discontinuation from treatment (the mITT Population). Of note, 21 randomised subjects who received study 
drug were excluded from all populations because they had participated in multiple Sponsor studies.
In the mITT Population, 250 (13.6%) subjects overall discontinued study drug for a reason attributable to 
tolerability or lack of efficacy. A lower proportion of subjects in the BFF MDI groups discontinued due to lack 
of efficacy (8.2% in the BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg and 8.8% in the BFF MDI 160/9.6 μg treatment groups) 
compared with the FF MDI treatment group (15.5%). The percentage of subjects who discontinued study 
drug due to an AE in the mITT Population was generally similar across treatment groups (range: 2.1% to 
3.6%).
All subjects were analysed according to the assigned randomisation treatment, and thus, the baseline 
characteristics of subjects in the mITT Population and Safety Population were the same.

COPD Exacerbations
BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg demonstrated an improvement in time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation 
compared with FF MDI (HR=0.827; p=0.0441).  The improvement for BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg compared with FF 
MDI was nominally significant after employing the Type I error control procedure for the secondary 
endpoints. 
The rate of severe COPD exacerbations was also evaluated as another endpoint and supports the analysis of 
rate of moderate or severe exacerbation. BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg and BFF MDI 160/9.6 μg showed nominally 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020

significant improvements in the rate of severe COPD exacerbations compared with FF MDI (rate ratio=0.48; 
p=0.0035 and rate ratio=0.54; p=0.0114, respectively).
Time to first clinically important deterioration (CID) in COPD
The median time to a CID event was longer during treatment with BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg (9.7 weeks) and BFF 
MDI 160/9.6 μg (11.7 weeks) relative to FF MDI (4.4 weeks).
The HR was statistically significantly in favour of BFF 320/9.6 μg
Average Daily Rescue Ventolin HFA Use
BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg demonstrated statistically significant improvements in LS mean change from baseline in 
average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use over 24 weeks compared with FF DI (-0.36 puffs/day; p=0.0052).
BFF MDI 160/9.6 μg demonstrated statistically significant improvements in LS mean change from baseline in 
average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use over 24 weeks compared with FF MDI (-0.34 puffs/day; p=0.0088).
In more severe COPD there is less reversibility, a difference in use of rescue Ventolin in favour of BFF is seen 
versus FF however it is not considered to be clinically relevant as the difference over 12 weeks and over 24 
weeks was – 0.32 and – 0.36
SGRQ Total Score 
BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg demonstrated a statistically significant greater percentage of SGRQ responders over 24 
weeks compared with FF MDI, with a treatment difference of 10.01% (p=0.0009).
BFF MDI 160/9.6 μg demonstrated a statistically significant greater percentage of SGRQ responders over 24 
weeks compared with FF MDI, with a treatment difference of 11.57%
The observed difference is considered to be clinically relevant.
TDI Focal Score (Secondary Endpoint)
The TDI is widely used to measure treatment effects; an improvement of 1 or more units in the total score 
has been defined as the MCID.  TDI focal score over 24 weeks was highest for BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg, the 
differences between BFF and FF was small at 0.25-0.27 and not considered to be clinically relevant.  
Ancillary analyses
Analyses were conducted for the following subgroups: history of moderate or severe COPD exacerbation in 
the last 12 months (1 vs ≥2), baseline eosinophil count (<150 cells/mm3 vs ≥150 cells/mm3), and region.
It is agreed that it is unlikely that the treatment would differ in different regions and is most likely due to 
small sample sizes from specific regions.  The subgroup analyses demonstrate some interesting information 
on the improvements in patients with a history of 2 or more exacerbations and also in patients with a blood 
eosinophil levels > 150 cells. A consistent improvement is demonstrated at both doses at weeks 12 and 24.

COPD Exacerbations: Study PT010006 demonstrated a 
statistically significant and highly clinically meaningful 52% 
reduction in moderate or severe COPD exacerbation rate for BGF 
MDI compared with GFF MDI.  These reductions were maintained 
following treatment with BGF MDI relative to GFF MDI for up to 
52 weeks in the subset of subjects from Study PT010006 who 
continued in the long-term safety extension Study PT010008.
Time to onset: Improvements in the adjusted mean change from 
baseline in FEV1 over time on Day 1 were observed for all treatment 
groups, with the greatest improvements observed for GFF MDI and 
BGF MDI.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Design and conduct of clinical studies
The applicant performed two pivotal studies for the efficacy assessment supporting the use of BGF MDI in 
patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Study PT010006 was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-centre 
study to assess the efficacy and safety of BGF MDI (triple therapy), GFF MDI (Bevespi), and BFF MDI 
compared with Symbicort Turbuhaler as an active control in subjects with moderate to very severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease.
A second pivotal study (PT010005), provided with the responses to major objections,  was a randomised, 
double-blind, multi-centre, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of BGF MDI (triple therapy) 
relative to GFF MDI (Bevespi) and BFF MDI on COPD exacerbations over a 52-week treatment period in 
subjects with moderate to very severe COPD. 
In this study two doses of BGF MDI were tested (BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg BID and BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 
μg BID) however, only approval of the higher dose (BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg BID) is being requested. 
Patients enrolled to both pivotal studies belong to GOLD group B or D based on their symptom severity and 
exacerbation risk.
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 189/238
 
 
The patient population selected for both  pivotal studies included symptomatic COPD patients (with CAT  10) 
with moderate to very severe airflow limitation (i.e. with FEV1 ≥25% to <80% predicted normal value in 
study PT010006 and with FEV1 ≥25% to <65% predicted normal value in study PT010005 ). 
The main difference in the inclusion criteria between both pivotal studies were in relation to requirement of 
having history of exacerbations in the previous year.
In  study PT010006 the entry criteria did not require an exacerbation in the prior year, whereas study 
PT010005 only enrolled patients with a history of exacerbations in the previous year and the number of 
required exacerbations depended on the severity of the COPD at baseline i.e subjects with a post-
bronchodilator FEV1 <50% of predicted normal must have had a documented history of ≥1 moderate or 
severe COPD exacerbation in the 12 months prior to Screening whereas subjects with a post-bronchodilator 
FEV1 ≥50% of predicted normal must have had a documented history of ≥2 moderate exacerbations or a 
documented history of ≥1 severe COPD exacerbation in the 12 months prior to Screening.  Some clarification 
is regarding this is required. 
In relation to the background therapy patients had to be on the stable dose of 2 or more inhaled maintenance 
therapies. Steroid dependent patients on the stable dose of oral steroids (</= 5mg day or </= 10 every 
other day) were eligible for enrolment.
The key criteria for exclusion were a diagnosis of asthma (based on the opinion of the Investigator), poorly 
controlled COPD, i.e. requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids or antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 
(Screening) with less than a 4-week washout of corticosteroids and/or antibiotics prior to Visit 1 or during the 
Screening Period (Visit 1 to Visit 4). Other exclusion criteria included clinically significant cardiovascular 
conditions, laboratory abnormalities, narrow-angle glaucoma and risk factors for pneumonia. 
In study PT010006 there were four arms BGF MDI (ICS/LABA/LAMA triple therapy) was compared to the 
applicant’s LAMA/LABA dual therapy (Bevespi) and two ICS/LABA combinations (applicant’ BFF MDI and 
Symbicort Turbuhaler). Symbicort TBH was an open-label treatment in this study.  
In study PT010005 there were also four arms. In this study two doses of BGF MDI (320/14.4/9.6 μg BID 
and 160/14.4/9.6 μg BID) were compared to LAMA/LABA dual therapy (Bevespi) and ICS/LABA combination 
(applicant’ BFF MDI). The higher dose of BGF MDI (320/14.4/9.6 μg) had the same amount of budesonide as 
was in the tested BFF MDI (320/9.6 μg)
There were some uncertainties in relation to comparators used in the pivotal studies. Bevespi (GFF MDI) is an 
approved comparator. However, BFF MDI is not currently approved. The applicant provided satisfactory 
responses justifying the use of BFF MDI as a comparator.  The totality of evidence from Studies PT009002 
and PT009003 was considered sufficient for acceptance of BFF MDI as a comparator. Both studies showed 
improvements on lung function, COPD exacerbations, and symptom-based endpoints for BFF MDI relative to 
BD MDI and/or FF MDI. These improvements were sustained over 52 weeks in Study PT009003. The benefits 
of BFF MDI vs FF MDI and vs BD MDI are summarised by the non-inferiority of BFF MDI to Symbicort TBH.
The proposed indication for BGF MDI is the maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an
inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist or combination of a long-acting β2-agonist and a long-
acting muscarinic antagonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 
5.1). “ 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 190/238
 
 
Originally proposed broader indication (i.e for patients not adequately treated by two or more inhaled 
maintenance medications) was amended in the response to major objections raised during the procedure. 
The legal basis of this application is Article 10b fixed combination application. In line with the FDC 
guidelines, superiority or ‘add on efficacy’ can only be claimed to active substances to which patients have 
been demonstrated to be responding insufficiently to. In addition, the contribution of each component needs 
to be shown. The applicant compared the activity BGF MDI versus GFF MDI in order to explore the 
contribution of the ICS component whereas comparisons of BGF MDI versus BFF MDI/Symbicort explored the 
contribution of GP component. BGF MDI was not compared to ICS and LAMA combination, however, this is 
considered acceptable because such combinations are infrequently used.
According to the recommendations from the CHMP guideline on the investigation of medicinal products for the 
treatment of COPD, measurement of lung function parameters alone is considered to be insufficient in the 
assessment of therapeutic effect. If lung function is selected as a primary endpoint, additional evidence of 
efficacy must be demonstrated through the use of a co-primary endpoint, which should either be a symptom-
based endpoint or a patient-related endpoint. The guideline also states that number of exacerbations may be 
acceptable as a single primary endpoint, however the rate of exacerbation should be investigated over a 
period of at least one year due to seasonal variation in exacerbation rates.
For study PT010006, the applicant selected two primary endpoints however, both were investigating 
changes in lung function. TDI focal score, SGRQ Total Score and effects on exacerbations were analysed as 
secondary endpoints only and control of type I error across the BGF vs BFF and BGF vs GFF comparisons was 
considered to be insufficient for these endpoints. 
In relation to the selected lung function endpoints in study PT010006, it was considered that the 
assessment of trough FEV1 level over 24 weeks is the relevant outcome measure for therapies used for the 
management of a chronic condition such as COPD. However, the use of the second primary endpoint, FEV1 
AUC0-4, was considered as less relevant. 
It is considered that the design of study PT010005 submitted with the responses to major objections is in 
line the requirements of the CHMP guidelines.  In line with the guideline the primary endpoints of this 52 
week study was the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Time to first moderate or severe COPD 
exacerbations was a secondary endpoint. Other secondary endpoints included: change from baseline in SGRQ 
total score, TDI focal score over 24 weeks, change from baseline in average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use 
over 24 weeks and time to death (all cause). This study had the PFT Sub-study which focused on the 
assessment of changes in lung function (two co-primary endpoints investigated FEV1 AUC0-4 and over 24 
weeks for the comparison of BGF MDI to BFF MDI and change from baseline in morning predose trough FEV1 
over 24 weeks for the comparison of BGF MDI to GFF MDI. It is noted in a protocol amendment 6.1 dated 21 
Jun 2019 that a number of efficacy endpoints which “did not provide further insights into the primary and 
secondary endpoints” were not discussed in the CSR; removal of these endpoints reduced the volume of 
output for the CSR and facilitated focused review. This was not considered an acceptable justification: the 
applicant was requested to provide full analyses of any removed endpoints for completeness, although these 
endpoints were not considered as pivotal for decision making. The applicant provided the requested 
information. 
Furthermore, an exacerbation was classified as a new event if its recorded start date was more than 7 days 
after the recorded stop date of the earlier event. The applicant was requested to present additional sensitivity 
analyses using alternative minimum time gaps between two exacerbations for completeness: 10 days, 15 
days, and 20 days. The applicant presented the requested analyses for the Efficacy, Attributable and 
Assessment report

Treatment Policy estimands, which indicated that the results were not sensitive to the choice of minimum gap 
time between exacerbations. The results using SAP version 1 and 2 methods are consistent
An inspection was conducted at Pearl Therapeutics Morristown, (USA) following a request from the 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)/EMA in connection with the evaluation of the 
marketing authorisation application for BGF MDI (PT010).
The purpose of the inspection was to evaluate the compliance with ICH GCP and applicable regulations of the 
clinical trial with trial code: PT010005, in particular with regard to the validity of the data, endpoint 
characterisation and the statistical analysis, which provided the basis for the CSR Edition 1 dated 08 Nov 
2019.
Based on the results of this remote sponsor inspection, the inspection team was of the opinion that the 
quality of the data is acceptable for assessment.
Efficacy data and additional analyses
In study PT010006 a total of 1899 subjects (99.8%) were randomised and treated with the study drug.
Study PT010005 was a larger study as to this study 8573 subjects were randomised and treated with the 
study drug for 52 weeks. Slightly more patients completed the treatment in study PT010006 (86.0%) than in 
study PT010005 (77.6%).
In study PT010006 the highest number of subjects discontinued from the study drug were in the GFF group 
(16.4%) and BFF group (15.6%) as compared to the BGF group (11.4%) and Symbicort group (12.6%). The 
most common reason for the discontinuation was “subject discretion” (from 2.2 to 6.1%) and adverse events 
(from 3.5 to 4.4%). 
In study PT010005 the percentage of subjects who discontinued from study drug was the lowest in the BGF 
MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg group (19.4%) followed by the BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg (20.4%), BFF MDI (23.0%), 
and GFF MDI (25.6%) groups. The most frequent reasons for subjects to discontinue from the study drug 
were AEs (517 subjects [6.1%]), lack of efficacy (512 subjects [6.0%]), and subject discretion (451 subjects 
[5.3%]).
Significant changes to the statistical analysis plan were made as a part of a second amendment which 
changed the definitions of the primary trial estimand. It is noted that the applicant did not seek scientific 
advice from the CHMP with regard to acceptability of the revised primary efficacy estimand. 
In the original assessment a number of uncertainties in relation to the relevance of the study population were 
identified. It was considered that the enrolled patient population did not include a sufficient number of 
patients within GOLD D (there were 11% of such patients) and only 8% of subjects were within very serious 
disease category.
However, the most of these issues are considered resolved as more patients within GOLD D were enrolled to 
study PT010005 (more than 56.5%). In addition to this second pivotal study higher number of patients with 
very severe COPD were enrolled (924 (10.9%). For these reasons the relevance of the study populations is 
no longer questioned.  
Some further clarification was required in relation to patients receiving a triple therapy at baseline and 
subsequently randomised to dual therapy. Based on the discussion provided by the applicant, it can be 
agreed that treatment with BGF MDI provides reductions in the rate of moderate or severe COPD

exacerbations relative to GFF MDI and BFF MDI in subgroups treated with or without prior ICS/MA/BA triple 
therapy and with or without prior ICS use during the 30 days prior to Screening.
Results - study PT010006 (originally provided)
In study PT010006, the applicant selected two types of primary endpoints. 
BGF MDI demonstrated statistically significant improvements from baseline in the morning predose trough 
FEV1 over 24 weeks compared with GFF MDI however, the observed difference was not considered to be 
clinically relevant (LS mean deference was 22 ml).
For FEV1 AUC0-4 over 24 weeks, BGF MDI was statistically superior as compared to both ICS/LABA 
combinations investigated in the study (i.e. BFF and Symbicort TBH) however, the clinical relevance of the 
observed difference is not clear. LS mean difference was 104 ml for BGF/BFF comparisons and 91 ml for 
BGF/Symbicort TBH. 
As a part of PT010006, BFF MDI was compared to Symbicort TBH, to further support the use of BFF MDI 
as a main ICS/LABA comparator to BGF MDI. However, as discussed Symbicort TBH was an open label 
treatment in this study which limit value of this comparison (especially in the context of patient reported 
outcomes).
In PT010006 study, the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 24 weeks was analysed as a 
secondary endpoint. As highlighted above, the entry criteria did not require an exacerbation in the prior year 
and therefore it is not surprising that the percentage of subjects with exacerbations in the study was low 
(severe COPD exacerbations range: 2.7% to 5.3%, moderate COPD exacerbations range: 16.9% to 25.1%).
In this study, the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was statistically lower during treatment with BGF 
MDI relative to GFF MDI. The observed 52 % difference is considered to be highly clinically relevant; 
however, there were concerns regarding the stringency of the type I error control for this endpoint.
In relation to Time to First COPD Exacerbation, the risk of first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation was 
nominally statistically significantly lower during treatment with BGF MDI relative to GFF MDI (HR: 0.593; 
p<0.0001 [Cox regression] and p=0.0001 [log rank]).
The reduction in the annual rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 24 weeks was higher in 
subjects with a baseline blood eosinophil count of ≥150 cells/mm3 than those with a baseline blood 
eosinophil count of <150 cells/mm3; however, benefits were observed in both eosinophil subgroups. 
No statistically significant difference was observed in respect to the rate of moderate or severe COPD 
exacerbations over 24 weeks between BGF MDI versus BFF MDI and BGF MDI versus Symbicort TBH.
In this pivotal study, patients reported outcomes e.g. TDI focal score over 24 weeks and SGRQ total score 
over 24 weeks were examined as secondary endpoints. 
TDI focal score over 24 weeks was not statistically different for the BGF MDI versus GFF MDI and for the BGF 
MDI versus BFF MDI comparison. 
BGF MDI as compared to GFF MDI demonstrated a nominally statistically significant improvement in quality of 
life, as measured by the change from baseline in SGRQ total score over 24 weeks (-1.22 units; p=0.0259). 
However, the observed change from baseline in this score was again considerably less than what is generally 
accepted as clinically meaningful (according to the American Society of Thoracic Diseases a mean change 
score of 4 units is associated with slightly efficacious treatment, 8 units for moderately efficacious change 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 193/238
 
 
and 12 units for very efficacious treatment). Improvement observed for BGF MDI compared to the 
investigated ICS/LABA dual therapies did not reach statistical significance.
BGF MDI demonstrated a nominally statistically significant greater percentage of SGRQ responders at Week 
24 compared with GFF MDI, with a treatment difference of 6.06% (p=0.0395).
In relation to change from baseline in average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use over 24 weeks, reductions in the 
use of rescue medication between BGF MDI and GFF MDI, BFF MDI, and Symbicort TBH were not statistically 
significant.
Results - study PT010005 (provided with the responses)
The primary endpoint of this study was the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks’ 
treatment period. As stated above the assessment of the number of exacerbations is an acceptable single 
primary endpoint for studies in COPD. 
In this study a statistically significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations for the 
BGF higher dose (320/14.4/9.6 ug) was reported relative to both GFF MDI (rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.69, 
0.83], p<0.0001) and BFF MDI rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.87 [0.79, 0.95], p=0.0027). 
24% reduction in the rate of exacerbations reported in the BGF MDI (high dose) group versus GFF MDI is 
considered as clinically relevant. Lower reductions in the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations 
were observed for BGF MDI (high dose) versus BFF MDI comparison.  However, also in this case the reported 
reduction (13 %) could be considered as clinically significant (in line with Chapman and coll (2013).
Also, in relation to the time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation statistically significant 
improvements were observed in the BGF MDI groups versus both comparator groups (GFF MDI and BFF 
MDI).  For BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg relative to GFF MDI HR [95% CI] was 0.880 [0.807, 0.959], p=0.0035) 
and for BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg relative to BFF MDI HR [95% CI] was 0.887 [0.814, 0.966], p=0.0057).
In relation to the reduction of the rate of severe exacerbation statistically significant improvements were 
reported in the BGF MDI (high dose) group versus the BFF MDI group. Improvements compared to GFF did 
not reach statistical significance.
In the study, change from baseline in SGRQ total score, TDI focal score over 24 weeks and change from 
baseline in average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use over 24 weeks were assessed as secondary endpoints. For 
all these endpoints statistically significant differences in favour of BGF MDI were reported. BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 μg resulted in statistically significant improvements in LS mean SGRQ total score over 24 
weeks compared with GFF MDI (LS mean difference of -1.62 units; p<0.0001) and BFF MDI (LS mean 
difference of -1.38 units; p<0.0001) using the Efficacy Estimand. For SGRQ total score also a statistically 
higher proportion of responders was reported in the BGF group versus both comparator groups (responders 
were defined as subjects achieving an MCID of ≥4 units in SGRQ total score). BGF MDI significantly reduced 
the use of rescue medication over 24 weeks compared with GFF MDI and BFF.
Subjects treated with BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg had statistically significantly improvements in LS mean TDI 
focal score over 24 weeks relative to both GFF MDI (difference of 0.40 units; p<0.0001) and BFF MDI 
(difference of 0.31 units; p<0.0001) using the Efficacy Estimand. For TDI focal score more responders 
(defined as subjects achieving an MCID of ≥1 units) were reported only in comparison to GFF MDI but not in 
comparison to BFF MDI.
Changes in lung function were assessed in study PT010005 as a part of PFT Sub-study.
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 194/238
 
 
BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg resulted in a statistically significant improvement in LS mean change from baseline 
morning predose trough FEV1 over 24 weeks compared with GFF MDI (43 mL; p<0.0001) and a nominally 
significant improvement was observed in in LS mean change from baseline morning predose trough FEV1 
over 24 weeks compared with BFF MDI (76 mL; p<0.0001) using the Efficacy Estimand. Improvements in 
trough FEV1 over 24 weeks are considered as small especially for BGF MDI versus GFF MDI comparison.
In conclusion, reduction in the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations could be considered as 
clinically relevant for both comparisons e.g BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg versus GFF MDI and BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 μg versus BFF MDI although the magnitude of effect for BGF MDI vs GFF MDI was higher (23 % 
reduction) than for the comparison to BFF MDI (Chapman and coll. (2013) suggested that interventions 
reducing exacerbations by as little as 11% may be considered as clinically relevant). Secondary endpoints 
results were also supportive.
For this MAA, the applicant provided also the results of the extension study (Study PT010008).
The main purpose of study PT010008 was the assessment of safety and tolerability in subjects with moderate 
to very severe COPD. The efficacy was investigated through the exploratory endpoints only without any 
formal hypothesis testing; therefore, this study has a limited value in the context of efficacy assessment. 
Descriptive statistics was provided in relation to Ventolin use and the rate of COPD exacerbations over 52 
weeks.  
The applicant proposed to include in section 5.1 of the SmPC information in relation to mortality endpoints. 
This was not supported as some improvements seen in mortality are secondary to reduction in the rate of 
exacerbations.  In addition, some clarification was required for patients receiving triple therapy at baseline 
and subsequently randomised to dual therapy. This information was removed from the SmPC. 
Studies provided to justify the use of BFF MDI as a comparator in the main pivotal study. 
Phase 2 studies
The applicant conducted two studies in the phase 2 development to decide on the optimal dose for 
Budesonide (BD) in BFF MDI which was a comparator in the pivotal study for BGF MDI. These studies 
(PT008001 and PT009001) are considered as supportive and they are discussed below.
The dose of the FF component was previously decided on the authorisation of the LABA, LAMA combination 
Bevespi.
Study PT008001 was a randomised, double-blind, 4-period, 5-treatment, cross-over, multi-centre study in 
which four doses of BD (320, 160, 80 and 40 μg) were compared to placebo in patients with mild to 
moderate persistent asthma. The relevance for a COPD population is questioned. All 4 BD MDI doses were 
statistically superior to Placebo MDI as measured by the primary endpoint, the mean change from baseline in 
morning pre-dose trough FEV1 at the end of the treatment period. No BD MDI doses were assessed as 
statistically significantly different from each other as measured by the primary endpoint; however the trial 
was not powered for such a comparison. The highest BD dose 320 μg demonstrated the largest effect. In 
study PT008001, the applicant also conducted a post-hoc intra-subject comparison of BD with Pulmicort 
flexhaler. No appreciable differences between any dose of BD MDI and Pulmicort Flexhaler at Day 15 for 
mean morning pre-dose trough FEV1 was observed.
All secondary and other efficacy endpoints supported the results observed in the primary analysis.
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 195/238
 
 
The second phase 2 study PT009001 examined the combination of BFF with a fixed dose FF 9.6 μg in 
combination with different BD doses to provide BFF 320/9.6 μg, BFF MDI 160/9.6 μg, BFF MDI 80/9.6 μg. 
These fixed dose combinations were compared to mono components FF 9.6 μg, and BD 320μg.
The primary endpoint was lung function FEV1 area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC0-12) on Day 29. 
Secondary endpoints included Change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 over 28 days, Peak 
change from baseline in FEV1 on Day 1, Forced vital capacity (FVC) AUC0-12 on Day 29 and Transition 
Dyspnoea Index (TDI) focal score on Day 29.  Change from baseline in average daily use of rescue Ventolin 
HFA.
The Patient population were moderate to severe COPD however only 10% were treated for an exacerbation in 
the previous 12 months.  On Day 29, all doses of BFF MDI resulted in statistically significant greater 
improvement in FEV1 AUC0-12 in comparison to BD MDI 320 μg. Only the highest strength BFF MDI 320/9.6 
μg resulted in a statistically significant improvement versus FF 9.6 μg (56 mL). 
In the secondary endpoint change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 over 28 days compared to 
FF MDI 9.6 μg, a difference of 55 ml was seen. It is again questioned whether this difference is clinically 
relevant.
For TDI score none of the BFF MDI comparisons to FF MDI or BD MDI achieved a clinically important mean 
difference of 1 unit. No dose response from lower to higher dose was observed. None of the comparisons of 
the BFF doses to one another was statistically significant.  The highest TDI score was achieved for the lower 
strength 160 μg/FF 9.6 μg at 0.882.
Phase 3
In the phase 3 studies for BFF MDI, the company conducted study PT009002 to demonstrate the long-term 
efficacy and safety of BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg and BFF 160/9.6 μg compared with FF MDI 9.6 μg and BD MDI 
320 μg on lung function, as well as subject-reported symptom outcomes and health status.
The Co-primary endpoints were


Change from Baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 over 24 weeks (BFF MDI vs FF MDI; BFF MDI 
320/9.6 μg vs Symbicort TBH, non-inferiority) 
Change from Baseline in FEV1 AUC0-4 over 24 weeks (BFF MDI vs BD MDI; BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg vs 
Symbicort TBH, non-inferiority).
The relevance of FEV1 AUC0-4 over 24 weeks for studies investigating chronic treatment is questioned.
As for study PT010006, the design and selected primary endpoints were not in line with the COPD guidelines 
which state that if lung function is selected as a primary endpoint (FEV1 would be the parameter of choice), 
additional evidence of efficacy must be demonstrated through the use of a co-primary endpoint, which should 
either be a symptom-based endpoint or a patient-related endpoint.
As this was a 24 week study it was too short to conclude on exacerbations, however time to first 
exacerbation, time to clinical important deterioration and percentage of patients achieving an MCID of 4 units 
or more in SGRQ total score over 24 weeks were recorded for each group and also compared to Symbicort. 
The population enrolled were GOLD categories were mostly B (88-94%) and D. 
Change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 (mL) over 24 weeks (Efficacy Estimand; mITT 
Population) for BFF 320/9.6 μg was 31 ml higher versus FF 9.6 μg. For the second primary endpoint FEV1 0-4 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 196/238
 
 
over 24 weeks the difference between groups was 23 ml, both of these are of questionable clinical 
significance.
In this study BFF MDI was compared Symbicort TBH. However, as Symbicort TBH was an open label 
treatment, this limits its value as a comparator in this study. BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg was found to be non-
inferior to Symbicort TBH on both endpoints change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 (mL) 
over 24 weeks and change from baseline FEV 1 0-4 over 24 weeks.
In terms of COPD exacerbations, the time to first moderate to severe exacerbation as well as the rate 
appears to be in favour of Symbicort compared to BFF 320/9.6 μg. Also, there was a slightly higher % 
responders in SGRQ in favour of Symbicort (48.39%) versus BFF 320/9.6 μg (46.53%). 
The second phase 3 study PT009003 compared BFF 320/9.6 μg, BFF 160/9.6 μg, and FF 9.6 μg. 
The primary endpoint was morning pre-dose trough FEV1 at Week 12 (over 24 weeks Ex-US).  Again, the 
design of this study was not in line with the COPD guidelines. 
The secondary endpoints examined clinical endpoints such as time to moderate/severe COPD exacerbations, 
time to CID, TDI and percentage of subjects achieving an MCID of 4 units or more in SGRQ. There was a 
relatively high dropout rate as 39.3% of patients in the BFF 320/9.6 μg withdrew from this 24-week study.
The primary endpoint showed a 39 ml difference in favour of BFF 320/9.6 μg over FF 9.6 μg for change from 
baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1, however the clinical significance of this difference is questionable. 
The trial duration was too short for the endpoint on exacerbations and patients enrolled had a low frequency 
of exacerbations at enrolment.  However, there was a 4.2% difference in subjects with a COPD exacerbation 
in favour of BFF 320/9.6 μg over FF 9.6 μg
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The applicant performed two pivotal studies for the efficacy assessment supporting the use of BGF MDI in 
patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Study PT010006 was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-centre 
study to assess the efficacy and safety of BGF MDI (triple therapy), GFF MDI (Bevespi), and BFF MDI 
compared with Symbicort Turbuhaler as an active control in subjects with moderate to very severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease.
A second pivotal study (PT010005), submitted with the Day 120 responses, was a randomised, double-blind, 
multi-centre, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of BGF MDI (triple therapy) relative to 
GFF MDI (Bevespi) and BFF MDI on COPD exacerbations over a 52-week treatment period in subjects with 
moderate to very severe COPD.
According to the recommendations from the CHMP guideline on the investigation of medicinal products for the 
treatment of COPD (EMA/CHMP/483572/2012 –corr), measurement of lung function parameters alone is 
considered to be insufficient in the assessment of therapeutic effect. If lung function is selected as a primary 
endpoint, additional evidence of efficacy must be demonstrated through the use of a co-primary endpoint, 
which should either be a symptom-based endpoint or a patient-related endpoint. The guideline also states 
that number of exacerbations may be acceptable as a single primary endpoint, however the rate of 
exacerbation should be investigated over a period of at least one year due to seasonal variation in 
exacerbation rates.
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 197/238
 
 
The requirements of the CHMP guideline on the investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of COPD 
are considered as fulfilled  as in the study PT010005  a statistically significant reduction in the rate of 
moderate or severe COPD exacerbations for the BGF dose (320/14.4/9.6 ug) was reported both relative to 
both GFF MDI (rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.69, 0.83], p<0.0001) and BFF MDI rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.87 
[0.79, 0.95], p=0.0027). These reductions could each be considered as clinically relevant, although a smaller 
treatment effect was seen in comparison to BFF MDI. 
In the 24-week PT010006 study, BGF MDI significantly reduced the annualised rate of on-treatment 
moderate/severe exacerbations by 52% (95% CI: 36, 63; p<0.0001) compared with GFF MDI. 
Improvements compared with BFF MDI and BFF TBH did not reach statistical significance.
The results of other endpoints investigated in these pivotal studies provided a supportive evidence.  
Effects on lung function were investigated in both pivotal studies. In both studies BGF MDI improved on-
treatment lung function (FEV1) compared with GFF MDI and BFF MDI, although improvements as compared 
to GFF MDI were small.  
Change from baseline in SGRQ total score, TDI focal score over 24 weeks and change from baseline in 
average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use over 24 weeks were assessed as secondary endpoints. For these 
endpoints statistically significant improvements were observed for BGF MDI compared to GFF MDI and BFF 
MDI in the study PT010005, whereas in study PT010006 statistically significant improvements as compared 
to BFF TBH were only reported for TDI focal score.
Therefore it is considered that the provided data supporting the use of BGF MDI as a maintenance treatment 
in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not 
adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long acting β2 agonist or combination 
of a long-acting β2 agonist and a long acting muscarinic antagonist. 
2.6.  Clinical safety
BGF MDI is a fixed-dose triple combination of budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), glycopyrronium, a 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and formoterol fumarate, a selective long-acting β2 agonist 
(LABA) developed for long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. An indication to 
reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a risk of exacerbations is also proposed. BGF MDI is designed 
to be administered twice daily (BID) and delivered by oral inhalation. BGF MDI dose (2 inhalations) delivers 
budesonide(B) 320mcg,14.4mcg of glycopyrronium (G) and 9.6mcg of formoterol fumarate(F/FF). 
The BGF MDI COPD clinical development program supporting safety included 2 completed Phase III studies in 
subjects with moderate to severe COPD:

submission has been provided for review with the responses. 
Patient exposure
In the pivotal Phase III study (Study PT010006), 1899 subjects with moderate to severe COPD were treated 
for up to 24 weeks with one or more doses of BGF MDI (n=639), GFF MDI (n=627), BFF MDI (n=315) or 
Symbicort (n=318). Of that 566 subjects completed 24 weeks of treatment with BGF MDI. 
In Phase III study (Study PT010008), which was a follow on study from PT010006, 377 subjects of the 456 
subjects eligible for inclusion in the study received treatment with study drug after 24 weeks: BGF MDI 
(n=159) GFF MDI (n=148) and BFF MDI (n=70 subjects). A total of 142 subjects with COPD were exposed to 
BGF MDI for at least 12 months. 
An additional 314 subjects in Phase I studies were exposed to one or more doses of BFG MDI.
In Study PT010005 8529 subjects with moderate to severe COPD were treated for up to 52 weeks with one 
or more doses of BGF MDI (n=2144), GFF MDI (n=2125), BFF MDI (n=2136). A total of 1727 subjects 
completed ≥48 weeks of treatment with BGF MDI.
Demographics
The majority of subjects in Study PT010006 who were exposed to study treatment for 24 weeks were male 
(71.2%). Overall, 50.1% of subjects were white and by design, a large percentage of subjects (44.9%) were 
Asian. The large proportion of Asian subjects was due to the study being conducted in China and Japan along 
with US and Canada. The mean age was 65.2 years, with the majority of subjects in the ≥65 years’ age 
group (55.4%). Mean BMI, (kg/m²) was 24.9. Demographic characteristics in Study PT010006 were generally 
similar across the treatment groups in the study.
The 52-week study (Study PT010008) was conducted exclusively in the US. The majority of subjects in the 
Safety Population in Study PT010008 were white (90.8%), male (53.1%), and not Hispanic or Latino 
(95.6%). The mean age was 62.8 years with the majority of subjects in the <65 years age group (57.5%). 
The mean BMI was 29.0kg/m2. Demographic characteristics in Study PT010008 were also generally similar 
across treatment groups.  
Baseline and disease characteristics
The majority of subjects in Study PT010006 (71.8%) had used ICS at screening, and the majority of subjects 
(60.4%) were former smokers; the mean smoking history was 51.7 pack-years. The overall mean total 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test (CAT) score at baseline was 18.3 and was similar 
across the treatment Groups. 66.1% had a CAT score ≥15 at baseline. The percentage of subjects with a 
blood eosinophil count ≥150 cells/mm3 was 51.8%. Baseline exacerbation history was also similar across the 
treatment groups. Most subjects (74.4%) had no history of a COPD exacerbation in the year prior to 
screening. 66.1% had a cardiovascular risk factor of interest, and the most common were hypertension 
(52.8%), high total cholesterol (38.7%), and diabetes (14.8%).

In Study PT010008 the majority of subjects (77.2%) had used ICS at screening, were former smokers 
(47.8%) with a mean smoking history of 53.7 pack-years. The overall mean total CAT score at baseline was 
21.1 and approximately two-thirds of subjects had a blood eosinophil count ≥150 cells/mm3 at baseline. 
Most subjects (76.6 %) had no history of a COPD exacerbation in the year prior to screening. (79.2%) had a 
cardiovascular risk factor of interest, and the most common risk factors were hypertension (62.3%), high 
total cholesterol (55.5%), and diabetes (18.4%).
Baseline characteristics were generally similar across studies and across treatment groups within studies 
PT01006 and PT010008 however there were some differences, albeit small, across the two study populations. 
There were higher smoking rates, CAT score, blood eosinophil counts ≥150 cells/mm3, history of COPD 
exacerbation and cardiovascular risk factors for the PT010008 study compared with the PT010006 study. 
 In Study PT010005 patients with more severe COPD were recruited. Mean CAT score at baseline was 19.6 
and 56.5% of subjects had a history of ≥2 moderate or severe COPD exacerbations occurring in the 12 
months prior to screening, In PT01006 Mean CAT Score at baseline was 18.3 and 75% of subjects had no 
history of COPD exacerbation in the year prior to Screening.
Adverse events
For study PT010006 the safety population included subjects who were randomised to treatment and received 
at least 1 dose of the study drug. For Study PT 010008 the safety population included the subject population 
who were identified as having met the eligibility criteria for the study PT010008 during Study PT010006 and 
who continued to meet the eligibility criteria proceeded to study PT010008 and had data collected during 
PT010008.

The majority of subjects (59.6%) treated for up to 24 weeks Study PT010006 experienced at least 1 TEAE of 
which 32.0% were reported as mild or 19.7% as moderate in intensity. AEs were reported at slightly higher 
incidences in the BGF MDI (60.7%), GFF MDI (61.4%) compared to the BFF MDI (55.7%), and Symbicort 
(57.5%) groups. The incidence of severe TEAEs ranged from 5.7% to 9.6% across the treatment groups. The 
most frequently reported TEAEs overall (occurring in ≥ 2% of subjects) were nasopharyngitis (7.7%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (7.5%), COPD (3.7%) and bronchitis (3%). 
Overall 15.3% of TEAEs were considered to be drug-related by the Investigator (BGF MDI 17.5% vs BFF MDI 
14.6% vs GFF MDI 15.3% vs. Symbicort TBH 12.6%). The most frequently reported drug-related TEAE was 
dysphonia (2.1%), which occurred at a higher incidence in the ICS-containing treatment groups, BGF MDI 
(3.0%), BFF MDI (4.1%), and Symbicort TBH (1.6%), relative to the non-ICS-containing treatment group, 
GFF MDI (0.5%). The overall incidence (<2%) of the other drug-related TEAEs (muscle spasms, COPD, URTI, 
pneumonia and pharyngitis) was generally similar across the treatment groups. Oral candidiasis occurred at a 
higher incidence in the ICS-containing treatment groups, BGF MDI (1.3%), BFF MDI (1.3%), and Symbicort 
TBH (0.9%), relative to the non-ICS-containing treatment group, GFF MDI (0.5%).  The incidence of TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation of study drug was 4. 3%. The most frequently reported TEAE leading to 
discontinuation of study drug was COPD (0.7%). The types of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug 
were generally similar across the treatment groups.
Study PT010008 overall summary of TEAEs
A total of 74.8% of subjects in Study PT010008 experienced at least 1 TEAE. AEs were reported at similar 
incidences in the BGF MDI (74.2%), GFF MDI (76.4%) and BFF MDI (72.7%), groups. Most TEAEs were mild

to moderate in severity across all treatment groups. The incidence of severe TEAEs ranged from 9.1% to 
16.0% across the treatment groups. TEAEs were reported most frequently in the Infections and Infestations, 
Respiratory Disorders, Musculoskeletal, GI, Metabolism, Eye disorders and Vascular SOCs.
Overall URTI (9.2%), bronchitis (4.8%) COPD (4.8%) and UTI (4.6%) muscle spasms (4.4%) and sinusitis 
(4.2%) were the most commonly reported events across all treatment groups. The pattern and frequency of 
TEAEs were broadly similar across treatment groups. However, bronchitis (6.2%), sinusitis (5.7%) cataract 
(3.1%) were reported more frequently in the BGF MDI treated groups compared with GFF MDI (2.3%, 2.3% 
and 0% respectively) and BFF MDI (4.8%, 4.2% and 2.3% respectively). There was a higher frequency of 
pneumonia events in the GFF MDI group (4.6%) compared with the ICS-containing treatment groups, BGF 
MDI (2.6%) and BFF MDI (1.1%). (Pneumonia and exacerbation of COPD are further discussed as AESIs). 
The most frequently reported drug-related TEAEs for BGF MDI were dysphonia (2.1%), muscle spasms 
(1.5%), and oral candidiasis (1.5%), which were reported at a slightly higher incidence by subjects in the 
steroid-containing treatment groups relative to GFF MDI. All drug related TEAEs were reported most 
frequently in the BFF MDI group.
In the PT010008 Safety Population analysis which compared TEAEs during the first 24 weeks of the
study and after Week 24, overall, 63.8% of BGF MDI subjects experienced TEAEs during the first 24 weeks of 
the study and 55.0% of subjects experienced TEAEs after Week 24; the incidence of TEAEs was generally 
similar across treatment groups during the first 24 weeks (range: 57.1% to 63.8%) and after Week 24 
(range: 51.4% to 58.1%). Eye disorders were more commonly reported in the ICS treatments BGF MDI 
(7.7%) and BFF MDI (8.0%) compared with GFF MDI (4.6%). (Ocular side effects are discussed separately) 
During the first 24 weeks of this study, the most commonly reported TEAEs for BGF MDI were upper 
respiratory tract infection (5.6%), nasopharyngitis (3.8%) bronchitis (3.8%), and sinusitis (3.1%) diarrhoea 
(3.1%) back pain (3.1%). After Week 24, the most commonly reported TEAEs in the BGF MDI treated group 
were viral URTI (6.3%), URTI (5.6%), sinusitis (4.4%), UTI (3.8%) and COPD (4.4%). During the first 24 
weeks of the study 1.9% of the BGF MDI group reported COPD as a TEAE after Week 24 this increased to 
4.4%. The incidence of pneumonia was 2.5% and 0.6% over the same time periods. 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was similar across treatment groups (range: 
6.8% to 8.2%). The most commonly reported TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were acute 
respiratory failure, COPD, and pneumonia (each 2 subjects [0.4%]).
Study PT010005 overall summary of TEAEs 
A total of 5413 subjects (63.5%) reported at least 1 TEAE; 793 subjects overall (9.3%) reported TEAEs 
considered to be drug related by the Investigator. The incidence of subjects who reported TEAEs that were 
mild (range: 17.3% to 18.9%), moderate (range: 26.0% to 27.1%), or severe (range: 18.4% to 19.3%) in 
intensity was similar across treatment groups.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
SAEs
Over 24 weeks in Study PT010006, SAES were reported by 9.1% of subjects, (9% BGF MDI vs 11% BFF MDI 
vs 7% GFF MDI vs 9% Symbicort TBH and few subjects (1.5% overall - range: 1% to 1.9%) had SAEs 
considered to be drug-related by the investigator. SAEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 2.7% (range: 
1.9% to 3.5%) of subjects. Overall the most frequently reported SAEs were COPD and pneumonia. COPD was 
the commonest SAE and occurred at similar incidences in BGF and BFF group but lower than GFF MDI group 
and Symbicort groups (2.7% and 2.5% vs 5.1% and 4.1% respectively). Pneumonia was reported more 
frequently in BGF MDI (1.3%) compared with GFF MDI (1.0%) BFF MDI (0.3%) and Symbicort (0.0%) 
groups.
In subjects treated with BFG MDI over 24 weeks (safety population), the exposure adjusted rate for COPD 
was 61.3E/1000PY and for pneumonia was 20.9E/1000PY.
Acute respiratory failure occurred at higher incidence in BGF MDI treated group (0.6%) compared with GFF 
MDI group (0.2%) BFF MDI group (0.0%) and Symbicort groups (0.1%). Two further cases of ‘respiratory 
failure’ following treatment with BGF and GFF are noted in the exposure adjusted analysis.  None were 
considered to be related to study drug by the investigator. 
Over 24 weeks, Cardiac SAEs were reported by 1.1% for subjects overall (range 0.8 to 1. 3%).In the BGF 
MDI treated group, cardiac SAEs were reported in 0.8% of subjects. Five reports of acute MI were reported 
overall (0.3%), 2 in the GFF MDI group and 1 each in the other treatment groups. There were two reports of 
atrial fibrillation in the BGF MDI treated group. 
Over 52 weeks (Study PT010008), in total, 13.6% patients reported SAEs. Across treatment groups the 
percentage of subjects reporting at least one SAE was 17% in the BGF MDI group compared with 12.6% in 
the GFF MDI group and 8% in the BFF MDI group. Overall the most frequently reported SAEs were COPD 
(4.8%) and pneumonia (1.3%). The percentage of subjects reporting an event of COPD was higher in the 
BGF MDI group (6.2%) compared with GFF (5.2%) and BFF MDI groups (1.1%). For pneumonia, the 
percentage was higher in the GFF MDI group (2.3%) compared with BGF (1%) and BFF MDI groups (0.0%). 
In patients treated with BFG MDI, the exposure adjusted rate for COPD was 80.2E/1000PY in study 
PT010008. The exposure adjusted event rate for pneumonia was 12.3E/1000PY.
Cardiac disorder SAEs were reported in 2.6% of subjects overall. The percentage of subjects reporting a 
cardiac event was lower in the BGF MDI group (2.1%) compared with GFF (2.9%) and BFF MDI groups 
(3.4%). There were reports of acute MI (GFF MDI) and 2 reports of myocardial infarction (BGF MDI) and 2 
reports of AV block (BGF MDI 1 case and BFF MDI 1 case)
In the PT010008 Safety Population analysis which compared TEAEs during the first 24 weeks of the study and 
after Week 24 the incidence of SAEs (overall) increased over the two-time period for Respiratory disorders (0 
to ≤24wks (2.1%)) and 24 to ≤52 weeks (4.0%)), Cardiac Disorders (0 to ≤24wks (0.8%) and 24 to ≤52 
weeks (1.9%)), Gastrointestinal disorders (0 to ≤24wks (0.5%) and 24 to ≤52 weeks (0.8%). 
In the BGF MDI group, there was one ocular-related SAE which involved the progression of an existing 
cataract in 1 subject (0.6%) after Week 24 (Study PT010008) resulting in patient discontinuation from 
treatment.
In study PT010005, overall, 1744 subjects (20.4%) reported treatment-emergent SAEs. The most frequently 
reported treatment-emergent SAEs overall were COPD (10.4%) and pneumonia (2.5%); all other treatment-

emergent SAEs occurred in ≤0.7% of subjects. The incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was generally 
similar across the treatment groups.
Deaths
During study PT010006, 12 AEs with an outcome of death were reported on-treatment: 6 (0.9%) in the BGF 
MDI group, 3 (0.5%) in the GFF MDI group, 2 (0.6%) in the BFF MDI group, and 1 (0.3%) in the open-label 
Symbicort TBH group. 
Ten (10) out of 12 AEs across the treatment groups with an outcome of death were considered not drug-
related by the Investigator. The 2 deaths considered drug-related by the Investigator occurred in the GFF 
MDI group. Both were confirmed through adjudication as respiratory causes. 
Three deaths were confirmed as due to respiratory causes: 2 subjects in the GFF MDI treatment group 
(preferred terms: pneumonia and death) and 1 subject in the open-label Symbicort TBH treatment group 
(preferred term: metastases to spine [note: this event was adjudicated as respiratory (pneumonia)]). 
Three deaths were confirmed as due to cardiovascular causes: 2 subjects in the BGF MDI treatment group 
(preferred terms: acute MI and cerebral infarction) and 1 subject in the GFF MDI treatment group (preferred 
term: cardio-respiratory arrest) 
Four deaths were cancer related: 2 subjects in the BGF MDI treatment group (Acute myeloid leukaemia and 
small cell lung cancer) and 2 in the BFF MDI treatment group (encephaloma, lung cancer squamous cell 
carcinoma). 
Two additional deaths (BGF MDI treatment group) were attributed to smoke inhalation and sepsis.
In study PT010008 one additional death occurred after Week 24 in a subject treated with GFF MDI, 
(myocardial infarction) which was not considered by the investigator or the applicant to be related to study 
medication.
In Study PT010005 there were 151 deaths overall (1.8%), 1.3% occurred on treatment and 0.5% occurred 
post treatment. The incidence of on-treatment AEs with an outcome of death was (0.9%) in the BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 μg group, followed by 1.3%, in the BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg, 1.4%, BFF MDI and 1.6% GFF 
MDI groups. The majority of on-treatment AEs with an outcome of death were considered not drug related 
per Investigator assessment (109 out of 115 AEs overall [94.8%]).  On-treatment AEs with an outcome of 
death were most commonly adjudicated as due to cardiovascular (0.6%) and respiratory (0.3%) causes. No 
other causes were reported by >0.2% of subjects overall. The incidence of on-treatment AEs with an 
outcome of death was generally similar across the treatment groups, with the exception of AEs confirmed as 
due to cardiovascular causes, which were reported with higher frequency in the GFF MDI group (1.0%) 
compared with the remaining treatment groups (0.5% each). Adjudicated AEs with an outcome of death with 
onset during the Post-Treatment Period were reported by 40 subjects (0.5%) overall, (ranging from: 0.3% to 
0.7% across treatments) and were most commonly confirmed through adjudication as cardiovascular (0.2%).
Adverse events of special interest
Adverse events of special interest were defined based on the pharmacologically predictable effects of ICSs, 
LAMAs, and LABAs. Pneumonia was also included as an AESI. 
In Study PT010006 overall the most commonly reported AESIs overall were bronchitis (3.0%) Dysphonia 
(2.4%) and hypertension (1.8%) occurring most frequently in the BFF MDI treatment group. In the BGF MDI

containing groups (3.2% and 1.8%, respectively, for BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg, 2.5% and 1.3%, 
respectively, for BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg, and 3.1% and 1.5%, respectively, for BFF MDI) compared with 
the GFF MDI group (1.2% and 0.3%, respectively).
Pneumonia
Pneumonia (Adjudicated Events)
An external, independent CEC reviewed all AEs reported as pneumonia in line with predefined and clinically 
consistent pneumonia criteria.
In study PT010006 the incidence of confirmed pneumonia events in the BGF MDI and BFF MDI treatment 
groups was 1.9% compared with 1.6% of the GFF MDI treatment groups and 1.3% of the Symbicort MDI 
treated group.  Exposure-adjusted adverse event rate of confirmed pneumonia events was 43.3, 37.8, 45.4 
and 29.3 events per 1000 person-years for GFF MDI, BGF MDI, BFF MDI and Symbicort respectively.  
In PT010008 2.4% of study subjects had confirmed pneumonia events. The incidence of confirmed 
pneumonia events in the BGF MDI and GFF MDI treatment groups was 2.1% and 3.4%, respectively. 
Exposure-adjusted adverse event rate of confirmed pneumonia events was 40.6, 24.7, and 13.9 events per 
1000 person-years for GFF MDI, BGF MDI, and BFF MDI, respectively
PT010005 4.7% of study subjects had confirmed pneumonia events. The incidence of confirmed pneumonia 
events in the BGF MDI 320, BGF 160, BFF and GFF MDI treatment groups was 4.2% 3.2% 4.5% and 2.3%, 
respectively. Exposure-adjusted adverse event rate of confirmed pneumonia events was 49.1, and 41.3, 
57.8, 28.8 and events per 1000 person-years for BGF MDI 320, BGF MDI 160 and BFF MDI GFF MDI, 
respectively. Confirmed pneumonia incidence did not increase within or across treatment groups from 0 to 
≤24 weeks (range: 1.4% to 2.0%) relative to >24 weeks (range: 1.0% to 2.8%).
MACE (Major adverse cardiac events)
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 204/238
 
 
In Study PT010006 all cases of MACE were evaluated by a CEC using predefined criteria. A total of 1.2% of 
subjects had 24 serious CV events submitted to the CEC, and 0.5% had 9 of these events confirmed as 
MACE. The incidence of events confirmed as MACE ranged from 0.3% to 0.6% across the treatment groups. 
The events confirmed as MACE were non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (BGF MDI 0.0%; GFF MDI 0.3%; 
BFF MDI 0.6% and Symbicort 0.6%) and cardiovascular death (BGF MDI 0.3% and GFF 0.2% [0.2%]). The 
exposure-adjusted adverse event rate of MACE events overall was 11.1 per 1000 person-years and 7.2, 11.3 
,15.1 and 14.6 in the BGF MDI, GFF MDI, BFF MDI and Symbicort treatment groups respectively.
In Study PT010008 a total of 6 subjects (1.3%) had events confirmed as MACE, as determined by the CEC (2 
subjects in the first 24 weeks and 4 subjects after Week 24). The incidence of non-fatal MI was 1.0% for BGF 
MDI and 1.1% for GFF MDI treatment groups. The incidence of cardiovascular death was 0.3% and 0.2% in 
the BGF MDI and BFF MDI treatment groups respectively.  There were no events confirmed as MACE for 
subjects in the BFF MDI treatment group.
Exposure-adjusted rate of adverse events confirmed as MACE was similar between the BGF MDI and GFF MDI 
treatment groups (18.5 and 20.3 events per 1000 person-years, respectively).
Study PT010005
In Study PT010005 a total of 128 subjects (1.5%) had events confirmed as MACE, as determined by the CEC. 
The most frequently reported events overall confirmed as MACE were cardiovascular death and non-fatal MI 
(0.6% each).
Exposure-adjusted rate of adverse events confirmed as MACE were highest in the GFF MDI group (26.6 
events per 1000 person-years) and similar across the BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg, BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg, 
and BFF MDI groups (range: 13.1 to 16.9 events per 1000 person-years). Additionally, confirmed MACE 
incidences were similar (0.8%) within treatment groups from 0 to ≤24 weeks and >24 weeks.)
Laboratory findings
Haematology
In Study PT010006 one patient treated with BGF MDI had low WBC (<2000/µl). Two patients, one treated 
with BGF MDI and one treated with GFF MDI reported low platelets(<50,000/µl). In Study PT010008 one 
subject treated GFF MDI had a low Hb level. Two patients treated with BGF MDI had a low platelet level.  No 
subjects reported haematology related SAES or AEs leading to study drug discontinuation in either study.

Clinical Chemistry
Potentially Clinically Significant (PCS) clinical chemistry values
Over the 24-week treatment period for Study PT010006, Post-baseline newly occurring or worsening PCS 
clinical chemistry values occurred in overall ≤1.2% of all subjects but were most frequently observed for 
glucose (>13.9 mmol/L if baseline was ≤10 mmol/L and >16.7 mmol/L if baseline was >10 mmol/L; 1.2% of 
subjects each) and potassium (<3.0 mmol/L; 0.8% of subjects).
The overall incidences of clinically significant abnormalities in GGT, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total 
bilirubin were low (≤1.0%) and similar across all treatment groups. No subjects reported clinical chemistry 
related TEAES or SAEs. Clinical chemistry-related AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were blood 
alkaline phosphatase and blood bilirubin increased in 1 subject (No causality assessment provided) in the BGF 
MDI treatment group and blood creatinine increased in 1 subject (Event was considered nonrelated to study 
drug and resolved) in the GFF MDI treatment group.
Over 52 weeks overall ≤2.6%, subjects had post-baseline newly occurring or worsening PCS clinical 
chemistry values during the study. Those most frequently observed (all subjects) were for raised glucose 
(2.6%), potassium <3.0 mmol/L (1.1%) and AST >3xULN (1.1%). All subjects with elevated PCS glucose 
levels had a medical history of diabetes mellitus. The incidences of clinically significant abnormalities in GGT, 
AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin were low (0.2% to ≤1.1%) and similar across all 
treatment groups. The incidence of clinically significant hypokalaemia ranged from 1.0% to ≤1.2%) and was 
similar across all treatment groups. No subjects met Hy’s Law criteria during the study.
Kidney function
In Study PT010006 post-baseline newly occurring or worsening PCS eGFR values were observed in 3 subjects 
(0.2%), 2 subjects in the BGF MDI treatment group and 1 subject in the GFF MDI treatment group. None of 
these subjects had an SAE or TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation associated with the PCS eGFR 
value. 
In Study PT010008 post-baseline newly occurring or worsening PCS eGFR values were observed in 4 subjects 
(0.9%) for eGFR (3 subjects in the BGF MDI treatment group and 1 subject in the GFF MDI treatment group). 
None of these subjects had an SAE or TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation associated with the PCS 
eGFR value. 
The kidney function-related SAEs were acute kidney injury (1 BFF MDI subject) and nephrolithiasis (1 BGF 
MDI subject). The SAE of acute kidney injury led to the subject’s discontinuation from study drug.
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety
4.0% of all subjects in the PT010006 Safety Population (BGF MDI 4.1% vs GFF MDI 5.1% vs BFF MDI 3.8% 
and Symbicort TBH 1.9%) and 6.1% of all subjects (BGF MDI 6.7% vs GFF MDI 4.6% BFF MDI 8.0%) in the 
Safety Population in Study PT010008 reported bradycardia (≤50 bpm and decrease ≥15% from baseline.) 
two subjects 1treated with BGF MDI and 1 treated with BFF MDI had SAEs of complete AV block.
2.8% of all subjects (BGF MDI 3.0%vs GFF MDI 2.6% vs BFF MDI 3.2% vs Symbicort 2.5%) in the Study 
PT010006 and 3.5% of all subjects (BGF MDI 2.6%vs GFF MDI 4.6% vs BFF MDI 3.4%) in Study PT010008) 
reported SBP ≤90 mmHg with a decrease from baseline ≥20 mmHg. One subject in the GFF MDI treatment 
group reported a vital sign-related SAE of hypertension, and 1 subject in the open-label Symbicort TBH 
treatment group had a TEAE of hypertension that led to discontinuation of study drug.

ECG 
Mean changes from baseline in the heart rate
The mean changes from baseline for heart rate over time were small and similar across the treatment groups 
at each time point assessed for the Study PT010006 Safety Population (range: -3.9 to 4.5 beats per minute 
[bpm]) and the Safety Population in Study PT010008 (range: -2.1 to 1.0 bpm).
Calculated Fridericia-corrected QT (QTcF)
A total of 0.3% of all subjects in the Study PT010006 (BGF MDI 0.5%; GFF MDI 0.2%; BFF MDI 0.6% and 
Symbicort 0%) and 1.3% of all subjects in Study PT010008 (BGF MDI 1.5%; GFF MDI 0.6%; BFF MDI 2.3%) 
had QTcF values that were >500 msec and had   increased by ≥60 msec from baseline. Most of the post-
baseline newly occurring or worsening PCS ECG values in both studies were transient. Electrocardiogram-
related SAEs in the Study PT010006 Safety Population were atrial fibrillation in 2 subjects in the BGF MDI 
treatment group, ECG T wave inversion in 1 subject in the GFF MDI treatment group, and atrioventricular 
block complete in 1 subject in the BFF MDI treatment group.
HPA Axis Function (Study PT010006)
There was a small reduction in serum cortisol geometric means in every treatment group between baseline 
and the end of the 24-week Treatment Period. Diurnal pattern in serum cortisol concentrations was similar 
across all treatments. The observed geometric mean ratio to Baseline in 0-24-hour mean serum cortisol was 
0.86, 0.94, 0.73 and 0.94 for the BGF MDI, GFF MDI, BFF MDI and open-label Symbicort TBH treatment 
groups respectively.
 BMD Endpoints
All BMD analyses were based on the BMD Population in Study PT010008. At Week 52, the percent changes 
from baseline in BMD of the lumbar spine were small and similar across treatment groups (range: -0.1% to 
0.4%). Changes in BMD of the lumbar spine for both BGF MDI and BFF MDI were non-inferior to GFF MDI, 
treatment difference [95% CI]: BGF MDI vs GFF MDI = -0.5% [-1.4%, 0.5%]) and GFF MDI vs BFF MDI = 
(0.5% [-0.7%, 1.7%]) A broadly similar picture was seen for percent change from baseline in BMD in Total 
Hip at Week 52 in terms of shifts in total hip BMD T-score from baseline to week 52. In this study, however, 
the proportion of subjects who shifted from baseline (> -2.5 and ≤-1) to a worsening score in total hip BMD 
(≤-2.5) in the BGF MDI (5.8%) was similar to the BFF MDI (5.6%) group but higher compared with GFF 
(1.9%).
There were 2 cases of rib fracture in GFF MDI treated population ;1 case of lumbar vertebral fracture in GFF 
MDI treated population and 1 case of hip fracture and 1 case of upper limb fracture in the BGF MDI treated 
population).
Ophthalmologic evaluation
The applicant has specifically evaluated the potential effects of BGF MDI on ophthalmologic assessment 
parameters in Study PT010008 which included an ophthalmologic population of 311 patients.
The primary ophthalmologic endpoint was the change from baseline in Lens Opacities Classification System 
III severity of posterior subcapsular cataract (LOCS III [P]) score at Week 52.
In the data presented, BGF MDI and BFF MDI were non-inferior to GFF MDI for the primary ophthalmologic 
endpoint (change from baseline to Week 52 in LOCS III P score) and no major differences were observed

across the 3 treatments for the secondary ophthalmologic endpoints assessed. The incidence of Class 3 shifts 
(≥1.5 units, indicative of clinical worsening) observed during this study was low across all treatment groups 
(≤8.2%).
It is noted that the proportion of subjects in the ICS-containing treatment groups (BGF MDI and BFF MDI) 
with LOCS III grade increases in P score of ≥0.5 (Class 1) were higher than the proportion of GFF MDI 
subjects (14.4% and 12.2% vs 7.4%, respectively). This is not an unexpected finding. 
A higher percentage of BGF MDI subjects (10.8%) experienced LOCS III grade increases of ≥1.0 (Class 2) 
units in P score at Week 52 when compared to BFF MDI (6.1%) and GFF MDI subjects (5.3%) (BGF 10.8% vs 
BFF 6.1% and GFF 5.3%, respectively).
While the difference in LOCS III scores between BGF and BFF MDIs versus GFF MDI is not unexpected given 
the absence of ICS component in GFF, it is noted that some difference was observed between BGF and BFF 
MDI with patients in the BGF MDI group experiencing greater changes in LOCS III scores. 
The overall increases across all LOCS III grades progressed over the duration of the study. The overall 
percentage of patients with LOCS III grade increases was higher for all groups at Week 52 when compared to 
week 28, with grades in the BGF MDI group increasing from 7.1% at 28 weeks to 11.4% at end of treatment 
(BGF 11.4%, BFF 7.9%, and GFF 4.7% versus Week 28= BGF 7.1%, BFF 2.8%, and GFF 1.1%). However, at 
individual patient level the increased proportion of subjects with a LOCS III Class 3 increase at Week 52 and 
at the end of treatment is not due primarily to subjects worsening over time and also is not limited to the 
BGF MDI group.
The presence of multiple confounding factors in the cases of LOCS III progression are noted. A total of 278 
subjects (61% of the Safety Population) had an ophthalmologic risk factor of relevance including family 
history of cataract (34.6%), outdoor occupation more than 2 years (22.4%), and treatment with ophthalmic 
or systemic steroids (14.5%), which were generally similar across treatment groups (Study PT010008).
In relation to IOP, the overall changes from baseline in intraocular pressure (IOP) were low and similar in the 
BGF MDI and GFF MDI treatment groups at Week 52 (each 0.7%), and slightly lower in the BFF MDI group 
(0.2%).
In the BGF MDI group, the percentage of patients with an increase of >7mm IOP at 28 weeks was 2.4%. This 
increased to 4.4% at 52 weeks. A similar trend was noted in the BFF group (2% at 28 weeks versus 4% at 
52 weeks). No major differences were noted across both ICS groups.
Safety in special populations
The safety of BGF MDI in special groups was demonstrated by an analysis of AEs and SAEs according to the 
intrinsic factors of age, gender and race and country for Study PT010006 only. Overall the proportion of 
subjects >65 reporting TEAE was slightly higher than the <65-year group (61.3% vs 57.45% respectively). A 
higher proportion of subjects in the overall >65 population compared with the <65 population reported 
TEAES that were related to study drug (16.7% vs 13.7%). The percentage of subjects with serious TEAEs 
(10.8% vs 7.1%) and TEAEs/SAEs leading to discontinuation (3.4% vs 1.9%) were also higher in the >65 
compared to the <65 age cohort. 
Updated safety analysis has been provided by severity of COPD, smoking history, CV risk factors. Spacer use 
was not permitted in Phase III clinical program.

In Study PT010006 the overall incidence of TEAEs and SAEs was broadly similar within treatment groups 
across the subgroups of BMI category, COPD severity, cardiovascular risk factor, and smoking status.  There 
was some variability which, as discussed by the applicant could be due to the very small numbers in some of 
the subgroups.
in Study PT010005, which included patients with more severe COPD than those in Study PT010006 there was 
an increased incidence of SAEs in subjects with more severe COPD (SAEs all subjects: Moderate COPD 
16.9%; Severe COPD 20.7%; very severe 28.4%) and increased number of cardiovascular risk factors 
(Cardiovascular 0 risk factor 17.2%; ≥1 risk factor 19.3%; ≥2 risk factors 23.7%), current smoker (20.4%) 
former smoker (20.5%). The overall safety population SAE rate was 11.9%. This increase is SAEs is mainly 
driven by an increase in exacerbation of COPD which the applicant attributes to the fact that patients with 
more severe COPD were recruited to this study.
Gender
A higher proportion of the study population were male (n=1350) compared to female (n=546). TEAEs were 
reported at similar incidences in male subjects compared with female subjects in the BGF MDI treated 
population (60.2% vs 62%), but were lower in male subjects compared with female subjects in GFF MDI 
(58.6% vs 67.7%), BFF MDI (55.1% vs 64.4%), and Symbicort (58% vs 63.3%) treatment groups. Based on 
the available data no new safety concerns were identified following analysis of AEs and SAEs according to the 
intrinsic factors of gender.
Race
The majority of subjects were Asian (N=852) or White (N=950). Only 90 subjects were classified as Black. A 
higher proportion of Asian subjects had TEAEs related to study treatment (18.5%) compared with 13% of 
White subjects and 10% of black subjects. The proportion of Asian subjects with serious TEAEs related to 
study treatment was also slightly higher in this group (Asian subjects 2.3% vs. 0.8% White subjects vs 0.0% 
Black subjects).
Immunological events
The reporting rates for hypersensitivity adverse events were low and comparable between treatments 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with BGF MDI. Co-administration of BGF MDI with 
other anticholinergic and/or long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist containing medicinal products has not been 
studied and is not recommended. Budesonide is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. Co-treatment with CYP3A 
inhibitors could increase the risk of systemic side effects. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events
Over the 24-week study adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the 
study occurred in 4.3% (range: 3.5% to 4.8%) overall. TEAEs leading to discontinuation were COPD, 
dyspnoea (4 subjects), dysphonia, pneumonia and muscle spasms, sepsis and atrial fibrillation (3 subjects 
each). The only TEAE occurring most frequently in the BGF MDI group was dyspnoea (3 cases; 0.5%).
Over the 52-week study adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the 
study occurred in 7.5%% (range: 6.8% to 8.2%) overall. TEAEs leading to discontinuation reported by ≥2

subjects were acute respiratory failure, COPD, and pneumonia. All of which were reported by subjects in the 
GFF MDI treatment group.
Study PT010005
Over the 52-weeks adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug occurred in 6.1% (range: 5.3% to 
6.9 % overall. TEAEs leading to discontinuation reported by ≥0.5% subjects were COPD, dyspnoea and 
pneumonia. Reporting rates were similar across treatment groups.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety
BGF MDI consists of a fixed dose combination of budesonide, glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate. The 
safety profile of the individual components has been previously characterised as single agents or in other 
combinations and is well known. 
The extent of patient exposure to BGF MDI in the two studies discussed in this safety review is generally in 
line with recommendations of the ICH guideline (E1) (300-600 patients exposed for 6 months with 100 
patients exposed for a minimum of one-year). However, the total number of individuals exposed to the 
investigational drug BGD MDI (953 subjects) falls short of the 1500 individuals recommended in the ICH(E1) 
guideline. However as this is a combination therapy and there is significant safety data for the individual 
components and combinations of some of the components, this smaller overall exposure is acceptable. The 
safety database for BGF MDI although relatively small is considered to be adequate. Two additional 52-week 
safety studies (Study PT010007, an extension study in Japanese COPD patients who participated in Study 
PT010006and Study PT010005 (Ethos), a 52-week COPD exacerbation study, have been provided for review
In the Phase III study (Study PT010006), 639 subjects were treated BGF MDI. An additional 314 subjects in 
Phase I studies were exposed to one or more doses of BFG MDI with a subsequent total number of 953 
subjects being exposed to BGF MDI. Safety data from the 314 subjects in Phase I studies was not discussed 
in the original application. The applicant has provided an overview of safety data for 5 completed studies in 
healthy subjects (Study PT010001, Study PT010002, Study PT010003, Study PT010010, and Study 
PT010011) and 1 completed study in subjects with moderate to severe COPD (Study PT010018). No new or 
unexpected safety signals were observed in the Phase I studies in healthy subjects or subjects with COPD. In 
the 24-week study, completion rates and low rates of discontinuation due to an adverse event suggest that 
overall the study treatments were well tolerated. Of the original 1899 subjects treated in PT010006 456 
subjects (excluding subjects treated with Symbicort TBH) were eligible to continue from Study PT010006 into 
PT010008. A total of 78 subjects discontinued before commencing visit 10b transition visit at the start of 
Study PT010008. A summary of reasons for discontinuation for the Safety Population in Study PT010008 is 
presented. Individual reasons for discontinuation were broadly comparable across each treatment group. 
Subject discretion was the commonest reason for discontinuing (GFF MDI 5.7% and BFF MDI5.7% vs 4.1 % 
BGF MDI) The proportion of subjects discontinuing due to adverse events and loss to follow up were highest 
in the BGF MDI group with frequencies of 4.6% for both compared with 2.9% and 4.5% (adverse events) and 
0.6% and 0% (loss to follow up) for GFF MDI and BFF MDI respectively. These small differences between 
treatment groups are not considered to be of clinical relevance.

Demographics
There were differences between the two study populations in terms of demographics (age distribution, 
ethnicity) and baseline characteristics (CAT score, smoking history, blood eosinophil count, ICS use at 
screening, CV risk factors.) 
The subset of patients for whom longer term data has been collected is relatively small. No subjects from the 
EU were included in the Phase 3 studies. Subgroup analysis of overall AEs by region as part of a Phase III 
long-term 52-week efficacy and safety study in subjects with COPD (Study PT010005), indicated that the 
safety profile in subjects in the EU was comparable if somewhat favourable compared to subjects in subjects 
in other regions (US and Asia). It is reasonable to conclude that the data from Study PT010006 and Study 
PT010008 are also representative of the expected safety results in the EU,
Adverse events
In study PT010006 (24 weeks exposure) similar proportion of patients had treatment emergent adverse 
events between the treatment groups. Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs overall (>2%) were nasopharyngitis, URTI, COPD and bronchitis.  Nasopharyngitis, URTI and 
bronchitis and dysphonia occurred at a higher incidence in the ICS-containing treatment groups, BGF MDI, 
BFF MDI and Symbicort TBH. Oral candidiasis (<2% overall) was reported more frequently in the ICS-
containing treatment groups, BGF MDI, BFF MDI, and Symbicort TBH, relative to the non-ICS-containing 
treatment group, GFF MDI. There was some variability in the pattern and frequency of TEAEs across the 
treatment groups. 
The percentage of subjects reporting drug related TEAES was higher in the BGF MDI Group compared with 
the other treatment groups. (18% BGF MDI vs 15% BFF MDI vs 13% GFF MDI vs 15% Symbicort TBH). 
Dysphonia, oral candidiasis, muscle spasm, COPD, URTI, pneumonia and pharyngitis were the most 
commonly reported treatment related AEs. Dysphonia and oral candidiasis occurred most frequently in the 
subjects treated with ICS. The overall incidence (<2%) of the drug-related TEAEs (muscle spasms, COPD, 
URTI, pneumonia and pharyngitis) was generally similar across the treatment groups. Slightly higher 
reporting rates were noted for all drug related TEAEs in the BGF MDI treated subjects compared to Symbicort 
except for pneumonia (Symbicort 0.9% vs BGF MDI 0.2%). There was a consistent trend towards slightly 
higher reporting rates for TEAEs in the BGF MDI treated subjects compared to Symbicort. This is noteworthy 
because a 12% higher exposure rate for budesonide with BGF compared to Symbicort was noted in the PK 
sub study in PT010006. A small increase in steroid related side effects was seen for BGF MDI compared to 
Symbicort over 24 weeks’ exposure for cases of dysphonia and oral candidiasis and for of the drug related 
AEs (dysphonia, oral candidiasis, muscle spasms, URTI and pharyngitis) and SAEs (acute respiratory failure, 
a fib and pneumonia). The differences in reporting rates for individual TEAEs were small however (<1.4%) 
and are unlikely to be of clinical significance. 
In Study PT010008 the most commonly reported TEAEs overall across all treatment groups were upper 
respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, COPD, and urinary tract infection, muscle spasms and sinusitis. 
Pneumonia, UTI, Oral candidiasis and sinusitis were reported by <2% of subjects across all treatment groups. 
The pattern and frequency of TEAEs were broadly similar across treatment groups. However, bronchitis, 
sinusitis and cataract event rates tended to be higher in the BGF MDI treated groups compared with GFF MDI 
and BFF MDI treated subjects. The most frequently reported treatment related AEs were dysphonia, muscle 
spasms, oral candidiasis and GE reflux. Similar to the 24-week study, dysphonia and oral candidiasis occurred 
most frequently in the subjects treated with ICS. Muscle spasms which is a known side effect of LABAs were

more commonly reported in the BGF MDI and BFF MDI treated groups compared with GFF MDI and 
Symbicort.
There was no increase in the pharmacologically predictable effects of β2-agonist activity (tachycardia, 
tremor) or anticholinergic effects for LAMAs such as urinary retention or gastrointestinal disorders such as 
diarrhoea and constipation. 
Serious Adverse events 
In Study PT010006 the incidence of SAEs was highest in the GFF MDI groups but was generally similar across 
the ICS treatment groups for BGF MDI, and Symbicort groups but slightly lower in the BFF MDI group.  Drug 
related SAE rates were low across all treatment groups (approx. 1%). The most frequently reported serious 
AEs and the only ones that occurred in ≥ 2 subjects in any treatment group were COPD, acute respiratory 
failure, pneumothorax, pneumonia, acute MI, atrial fibrillation, inguinal hernia and intervertebral disc 
disorder.
 COPD was the commonest SAE and occurred at similar incidences in BGF and BFF group but at lower 
incidences than the GFF MDI group and Symbicort groups over the 24-week treatment period. There was a 
slightly higher incidence of pneumonia in subjects treated with BGF MDI (1.3%; 28.9E/1000PY) compared 
with the GFF MDI (1.0%;22.7/1000PY) BFF MDI (0.3%;7.6/1000Y) and Symbicort (0.0%) groups over this 
period. 
Acute respiratory failure occurred at higher incidence in BGF MDI treated group (0.6%) compared with GFF 
MDI group (0.2%) BFF MDI group (0.0%) and Symbicort groups (0.1%). Two further cases of ‘respiratory 
failure’ following treatment with BGF and GFF were noted in the exposure adjusted analysis.  None were 
considered to be related to study drug by the investigator. In Studies PT010006, and Study PT010008 the 
overall rate of respiratory failure for BGF MDI treated patients is 0.8% up to 24 weeks but increase to 1.9% 
in the 24 week ≤ 52-week treatment period Although over the 24-week period analysis there is a small 
increase in reports of respiratory failure in patients treated with BGF MDI the majority of cases were 
associated with underlying conditions (reported as SAEs) that were likely to have caused the event.  This was 
further supported by the 52-week Study PT010005, where the overall incidence of respiratory failure in 
subjects treated with BGF MDI 320 µg was similar (1.7%) to the incidence rate seen in the 24 week ≤ 52-
week treatment period of Study PT010008. Rates of respiratory failure across treatment groups BGF MDI 
320µg, BGF MDI 160µg, GFF MDI, and BFF MDI groups were generally similar ranging from 1.5% to 2% 
across all treatment groups. There is no clear signal of an increase in respiratory failure associated with BGF 
MDI. No   update to the SmPC is required.
There was increased reporting of events associated with cardiac arrhythmias in subjects treated with BGF, 
BFF and GFF MDI compared to Symbicort alone. The overall reporting rates are small across treatment 
groups. All of the cases were confounded by past history of cardiovascular disease. There is no evidence of a 
further increased risk of dysrhythmia associated with BGF MDI other than that which is currently described. 
Current warnings in section 4.4 and 4.8 regarding cardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias 
specifically refer to cardiac arrhythmias, e.g. atrial fibrillation and tachycardia and cautions against use in 
patients with severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmias or severe 
heart failure. Cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles) are also 
included as uncommon side effect in section 4.8.Over 52 weeks in Study PT010008 SAEs were more 
commonly reported in the BFG MDI group (17%; 278E/1000PY) compared with the comparator treatments 
GFF MDI (12.6% 264E/1000PY) and BFF MDI (8%;181E/1000PY). Overall exposure adjusted rates of SAEs 
(278E/1000PY) for BFG MDI were higher in Study PT010008 compared with study PT010006 (263E/1000PY).

Similarly, to 24 weeks analysis in PT010006, the most frequently reported SAEs were COPD, reported in 
higher incidence in BGF MDI and GFF MDI vs BFF MDI and pneumonia, higher in GFF MDI group compared 
with BGF MDI and BFF MDI group.  In patients treated with BFG MDI, in the 24-week time period analysis in 
study PT010008 an increase in COPD SAEs were also seen over the time periods 0 to ≤24wks and 24 to ≤52 
weeks. (0 to ≤24 wks. (1.9%) and 24 to ≤52 weeks (4.4%) in Study PT010008).
In Study PT010005 the overall rate of SAE was (20.4%). SAEs were similar  in the BFG MDI 320 group 
(19.9%; E/1000PY) and BGF MDI 160 (21%; E/1000PY)  groups to  the comparator treatments GFF MDI 
(20.4% E/1000PY) and BFF MDI (20.6%;E/1000PY).The most frequently reported SAEs overall were COPD 
(10.4%) and pneumonia (2.5%) which were reported more frequently than in Study PT010008 (COPD 
(4.8%) and pneumonia (1.3%))
Patients with more severe COPD at baseline were included in study PT010005 which could have contributed 
for this increased rate of exacerbation of COPD. The majority of subjects in Study PT010005 had severe or 
very severe (GOLD 3; 60.5% GOLD 4; 10.9%) COPD. By contrast, in Study PT010006, a higher percentage 
of subjects had moderate COPD (49.1%) and lower percentages had severe (42.9%) or very severe (7.9%) 
COPD.  The overall incidence of COPD SAEs in Study PT010005 was similar across treatment   groups ranging 
from 9.4% to 11.3%.  Although a small increase in SAEs of exacerbation of COPD had been noted over time 
in Study PT010008, this trend towards an increase reporting rate of exacerbation of COPD was not replicated 
in Study PT010005 which included patients with more severe COPD. There was no increase noted over the 
time periods 0- ≤24weeks and >24 weeks. (5.2% vs 5.2% in the BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 µg treated group 
over the two time periods). All other treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in ≤0.7% of subjects.
The exposure adjusted event rate for confirmed pneumonia events for BGF MDI was 39.5 E/1000PY in study 
PT010006 and 24.7E/1000PY in Study PT010008 and 49.1 in Study PT10005. Similar to the COPD SAEs this 
could be related to the increased number of subjects with more severe COPD in this study. Of note, 
confirmed pneumonia incidence did not increase within or across treatment groups from 0 to ≤24 weeks 
(range: 1.4% to 2.0%) relative to >24 weeks (range: 1.0% to 2.8%).
There is no clear evidence of a cumulative effect from treatment with BGF MDI over longer term. In 
PT010008 over 52 weeks SAEs were more commonly reported in the BFG MDI group compared with the 
comparator treatments however in PT010005 the incidence of post-treatment SAEs was similar across 
treatment groups. In the 24-week time period analysis in study PT010008 a small increase in SAEs were also 
seen over the time periods 0 to ≤24wks and 24 to ≤52 weeks for overall SAEs in Cardiac and GI SOCs. The 
only SAEs reported in ≥2 subjects were 3 cases of (acute) myocardial infarct, two in the BGF MDI group and 
one (acute) in the GFF MDI group.  There were two reports of pancreatitis one each in the BGF and GFF 
treatment groups respectively. The narratives for two cases of pancreatitis have been provided and both 
cases were related to underlying medical conditions.
Death
Thirteen deaths were reported overall in Studies PT010006 and PT010008. In the 24 weeks’ analysis for 
PT010006, 12 patients died overall. (6 (0.9%) in the BGF MDI group, 3 (0.5%) in the GFF MDI group, 2 
(0.6%) in the BFF MDI group, and 1 (0.3%) in the open-label Symbicort TBH group in the BGF MDI group.) 
One additional death was reported during the treatment period of study PT010008.
Eleven out of 13 AEs across the treatment groups with an outcome of death were considered not drug-related 
by the Investigator. The 2 deaths considered drug-related by the Investigator occurred in the GFF MDI group 
(1 case pneumonia,1 case reported as unknown, adjudicated outcome COPD). Both were confirmed through 
adjudication as respiratory causes. An additional death in a subject in the open-label Symbicort TBH 
Assessment report

treatment group (preferred term: metastases to spine [note: this event was adjudicated as respiratory 
(pneumonia)]) was confirmed as due to respiratory causes. 
Four deaths were confirmed as due to cardiovascular causes: 2 subjects in the BGF MDI treatment group 
(preferred terms: acute MI and cerebral infarction) and 1 subject in the GFF MDI treatment group (preferred 
term: cardio-respiratory arrest). One additional death occurred after Week 24 n study PT010008 in a subject 
treated with GFF MDI, (myocardial infarction) which was not considered by the investigator or the applicant 
to be related to study medication.  
Four deaths were cancer related: 2 subjects in the BGF MDI treatment group (Acute myeloid leukaemia and 
small cell lung cancer) and 2 in the BFF MDI treatment group (encephaloma, lung cancer squamous cell 
carcinoma).
One death (BGF MDI treated subject) was due to smoke inhalation and was adjudicated as accidental and 
one death (BGF MDI treated subject) was attributed to sepsis.
Overall the pattern of deaths outlined reflects the background morbidity of the study population. There was 
no apparent pattern in the type or frequency of adjudicated events leading to death across treatment groups 
or across studies that suggested a contributory effect from any of the study treatments. 
In Study PT010005 1.3% (n=111) of subjects experienced on-treatment AEs with an outcome of death as 
reported by the Investigator (0.9% in the BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg group, 1.3% in the BGF MDI 
160/14.4/9.6 μg, 1.4% in BFF MDI and 1.6% GFF MDI  groups) Deaths were most commonly reported  in the 
of Cardiac disorders SOCs (0.4%); Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC (0.3%); and General 
disorders and administration site conditions (0.2%) SOC. Overall AEs with an outcome of death were most 
commonly confirmed through adjudication as due to cardiovascular (0.6%) and respiratory (0.3%) causes.
 Overall the pattern of deaths outlined reflects the background morbidity of the study population. There was 
an increase in the overall percentage of deaths reported in Study PT010005 (1.3%) compared to PT010006 
(0.6%).  The proportion of subjects who died and were treated with BGF MDI 360 320/14.4/9.6 μg was the 
same in both studies (0.9%).  There was no apparent pattern in the type or frequency of adjudicated events 
leading to death across treatment groups or across studies that suggested a contributory effect from any of 
the study treatments other than in Study PT010005 where deaths due to cardiovascular causes, were 
reported with higher frequency in the GFF MDI group (1.0%) compared with the remaining treatment groups 
(0.5% each). The different incidences in Study PT010005 compared to Study PT010006 are most likely due 
to the longer study duration and increased severity of COPD in subjects enrolled in Study PT010005.
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of special interest were defined based on the pharmacologically predictable effects of ICSs, 
LAMAs, and LABAs. These include but were not limited to cardiovascular effects, ocular disorders, urinary 
retention, gastrointestinal disorders, and anticholinergic effects for LAMAs; cardiovascular, tremor effects, 
hyperglycaemia, and hypokalaemia for LABAs; and local (e.g., candidiasis and voice effects) and systemic 
(e.g., bone and skin effects, diabetes control, ocular and taste effects, adrenal suppression) steroid class 
effects and lung infection for ICS. An external, independent Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC) reviewed all 
cases of pneumonia (using a predefined clinically consistent definition of pneumonia) and MACE. This analysis 
is of particular interest in determining any evidence of an additive effect on adverse events of the three 
actives being administered as an FDC in one combination inhaler. 
In study PT010006 the incidence of AESIs overall was generally low and similar across treatment groups with 
some small variations between treatment groups. The most commonly reported AESIs overall were 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 214/238
 
 
bronchitis, dysphonia and hypertension occurring most frequently in the BFF MDI treatment group. As 
expected, the incidence of dysphonia was highest in the treatment groups treated with ICS. 
Similarly, the candidiasis AESI was reported more frequently in the BGF MDI (2.2%) Symbicort TBH (1.6%) 
and BFF MDI (1.6%) compared with GFF MDI (0.8%) treatment groups. The cases of candidiasis were mainly 
of oral candidiasis and were most frequently reported in the ICS containing treatments. The AESIs of 
dysphonia and candidiasis are well described side effects of local steroids. Although none were severe or 
serious, these types of AEs can impact on patients’ compliance with treatment. The SmPC and PIL include 
warnings for patients about the potential risk of developing these side effects and pts and measures to 
mitigate these side effects. 
Overall reporting rates for confirmed cases of pneumonia across treatment groups were low (<2.3%).  Over 
24 weeks’ treatment Pneumonia was reported more frequently in BGF MDI group, and   BFF MDI compared 
with GFF and Symbicort. The risk of pneumonia following treatment with ICS is well described. The SmPC 
includes warnings in section 4.4 in line with art 31 referral wording on the risk of pneumonia (lung infection) 
in patients who take inhaled corticosteroid medicines to treat COPD. Three cases of paradoxical 
bronchospasm occurred in the GFF MDI (2 cases) and BGF MDI (1 case) treatment groups. Only 1 case met 
the protocol definition of paradoxical bronchospasm. Section 4.4 of the SmPC includes a warning regarding 
the risk of paradoxical bronchospasm that adequately describes this risk. No further warning is recommended 
at this point.
Diabetes Mellitus and associated hyperglycaemia was also reported in ≥2% of subjects treated with BGF MDI. 
The incidence of Diabetes Mellitus was slightly higher in the BGF MDI and GFF MDI (2.4%) treatment groups, 
compared with the open-label Symbicort TBH and BFF MDI treatment groups however all cases occurred in 
subjects who had a past history of diabetes mellitus. The incidence of AESI of hypokalaemia was low 
(≤1.6%) and comparable across all treatment groups. Section 4.4 of the SmPC currently includes warnings 
regarding the risk of hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia associated with high doses of β2-adrenergic agonists
Over 52 weeks’ exposure the most frequently occurring AESI preferred terms overall were similar to those 
identified in Study PT010008 (bronchitis, hypertension, pneumonia, and dysphonia). AESIs occurring most 
frequently in the BGF MDI group were, bronchitis and cataract. There was a higher incidence of bronchitis in 
the BGF MDI treated group in study PT010006 and PT010008. 
In Study PT010005 the incidence of AESIs was low overall and similar across treatment groups. The most 
frequently reported AESIs overall by preferred term were pneumonia (4.1%), bronchitis (3.3%), and 
hypertension (2.9%). The overall incidence of SAEs in Study PT010005 was similar for the 0 to ≤24 weeks 
and >24 weeks’ time periods (11.9% and 10.8%, respectively). By treatment group, the overall incidence of 
SAEs in the 0 to ≤24 weeks’ time period and >24 weeks’ time period was 11.1% and 11.1% for the BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 μg group, 11.5% and 11.6% for the BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg group, 13.0% and 9.5% for the 
GFF MDI group, and 11.9% and 11.0% for the BFF MDI group.  Exacerbation of COPD can be expected to 
occur as a progression of disease despite standardised drug treatment with combination therapies. Study 
PT010005 included subjects with more severe COPD at baseline compared to Study PT010006   which 
accounts for the higher rate of treatment-emergent COPD SAEs in Study PT010005.
In study PT010006 the adverse event rate of CEC confirmed pneumonia events overall was low overall but 
was slightly higher in BGF MDI and BFF MDI groups compared with GFF MDI and Symbicort treated patients. 
The exposure-adjusted adverse event rate of confirmed pneumonia events across the treatment groups over 
the 24-week treatment period of PT010006 were GFF MDI :37.8, BGF MDI: 43.3, and BFF MDI: 45.4 and

Symbicort 29.3 events per 1000 person-years compared with GFF MDI :40.6, BGF MDI: 24.7, and BFF MDI: 
13.9 events per 1000 person-years in PT010008.
Over 24 weeks the events confirmed as MACE were non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (6 subjects [0.3%]) 
and cardiovascular death (3 subjects [0.2%]). The incidence of events confirmed as MACE was low and 
similar across the treatment groups (range: 0.3% to 0.6%). Although the rates of MACE were relatively low 
and consistent across treatment groups considering the high background rates of CV disease /smoking in this 
population, the exposure-adjusted adverse overall incidence of MACE for subjects treated with BGF MDI was 
higher in Study PT010008 with 18.5 events per 1000 person–years compared with Study PT010006 with 7.2 
events per 1000 person-years. A similar effect was seen with GFF MDI treated subjects. 
Even accounting for the duplication of reporting between PT010006 and PT010008 the exposure-adjusted 
rate of MACE events in Study PT010008 for BGF MDI treated patients is 12.3E/1000 person-years for patients 
treated with BGF MDI compared with 7.2 E/1000 person-years for patients in PT010006. Of interest in study 
PT010005 the exposure-adjusted rate of MACE events overall was 18.1 per 1000 person-years ( highest in 
the GFF MDI group (26.6 MACE events per 1000 person-years) and lower and similar in the BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 µg, BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 µg, and BFF MDI groups (16.9, 16.4, and 13.1 MACE events per 
1000-person years, respectively) .However in this study  the incidence of MACE was similar in the time 
periods 0 to ≤24 weeks compared with > 24 weeks suggesting no increase over longer term exposure. 
Patients in this study had more severe COPD so this could have contributed to this higher rate of MACE.
However due to the clinical importance of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with COPD 
and the precautions provided in Section 4.4 of the proposed BGF MDI SmPC, these events will be monitored 
closely, using targeted follow-up forms for spontaneous adverse reactions reported and evaluated in future 
Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Reports (PBRERs). The MACE topic will be reassessed in full at the time of 
renewal.
Ocular ADRs and ophthalmologic evaluation
For the Safety Population in Study PT010008, the most commonly reported ocular TEAEs overall were 
cataract (1.8%) and IOP increased (1.5%); the remaining ocular TEAEs were experienced by ≤1% of 
subjects overall.
Although the incidence of ocular TEAEs was low over the 52 weeks of treatment for the Study PT010008 
Safety Population (i.e., subjects who continued past Week 24), the incidence of ocular TEAEs (in the SOC of 
eye disorders) was higher for the ICS-containing groups after Week 24 than during the first 24 weeks of the 
study (BGF MDI: 8.1% vs 1.3% and BFF MDI: 7.1% vs 2.9%). The higher incidences observed after Week 24 
compared with the first 24 weeks of the study were driven by the slightly increased incidence of cataract 
(including cataract subcapsular and cataract cortical; 3.2% vs 0.5%); however, the majority of the additional 
preferred terms reported after Week 24 were reported by only 1 subject. The incidence of IOP increased was 
also slightly higher after Week 24 than during the first 24 weeks of the study (1.9% vs 0).
There was one ocular-related SAE which related to a case of cataract in 1 subject (0.6%) in the BGF MDI 
group that occurred after Week 24 (Study PT010008) and required treatment discontinuation. Multiple 
confounding factors were noted in this case.
Over the 52-week treatment period, cataract was listed as one of the most frequently reported AESI 
preferred terms. The overall incidence of cataract reported in the BGF MDI group (3.1%) was higher than the 
BFF MDI group (2.3%).
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020

In the ophthalmologic evaluation, the primary ophthalmologic endpoint was the change from baseline in Lens 
Opacities Classification System III severity of posterior subcapsular cataract (LOCS III [P]) score at Week 52. 
Patients in BGF MDI group had a numerically higher percentage increase in LOCS III severity grades when 
compared to BFF MDI although both BGF MDI and BFF MDI were non-inferior to GFF MDI for the primary 
ophthalmologic endpoint (change from baseline to Week 52 in LOCS III P score) and no major differences 
were observed across the 3 treatments for the secondary ophthalmologic endpoints assessed. The incidence 
of Class 3 shifts (≥1.5 units, indicative of clinical worsening) observed during this study was low across all 
treatment groups (≤8.2%).
However, a higher percentage of BGF MDI subjects (10.8%) experienced LOCS III grade increases of ≥1.0 
(Class 2) units in P score at Week 52 when compared to BFF MDI (6.1%) and GFF MDI subjects (5.3%) (BGF 
10.8% vs BFF 6.1% and GFF 5.3%, respectively).
The overall percentage of patients with LOCS III grade increases was higher for all groups at Week 52 when 
compared to week 24, with grades in the BGF MDI group increasing from 7.1% at 28 weeks to 11.4% at end 
of treatment (BGF 11.4%, BFF 7.9%, and GFF 4.7% at Week versus  BGF 7.1%, BFF 2.8%, and GFF 1.1% at 
Week 24.
In relation to IOP, the overall changes from baseline in intraocular pressure (IOP) were low and similar in the 
BGF MDI and GFF MDI treatment groups at Week 52 (each 0.7%), and slightly lower in the BFF MDI group 
(0.2%).
 Laboratory findings.
The mean changes from baseline for haematology parameters were small. None of the changes in 
haematological parameters in any of the treatment groups resulted in clinically relevant changes for the 
patients involved.
For chemistry parameters, small and generally similar changes from baseline to end of treatment were 
observed across all groups in total bilirubin, AST, ALT and GGT, these findings are similar to those observed 
over 52 weeks of exposure
 Over both studies the most frequently observed TEAE was for raised glucose and hypokalaemia. All subjects 
with elevated PCS glucose levels had a medical history of diabetes mellitus. The incidence of clinically 
significant hypokalaemia ranged from was low and was similar across all treatment groups. The SmPC 
currently contains warnings in section 4.4 regarding the risk of hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia with 
exposure to high doses of β-2 agonists which are adequate.
 ECG parameters
Mean changes from baseline in the heart rate, PR interval were small and similar across treatment groups. 
ECG SAEs in the Study PT010006 Safety Population were atrial fibrillation in 2 subjects in the BGF MDI 
treatment group one of which resulted in study drug discontinuation. Atrial fibrillation resulting in study drug 
discontinuation was also reported in 3 subjects in PT010006. In Study PT010008, 1 subject in the GFF MDI 
treatment group (atrial fibrillation) in 1 subject in the BFF MDI treatment group (atrial flutter) discontinued 
study drug. Two reports of the reports of atrial fibrillation in the BGF MDI treated group reported in study 
PT010006 were serious. 
Fridericia’s corrected QT (QTcF)
A small number (0.3%) of all subjects in the Study PT010006 Safety Population and 1.3% of subjects in the 
Safety Population in Study PT010008 had potentially clinically significant QTcF values that were >500 msec 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 217/238
 
 
and had increased by ≥60 msec from baseline. The percentage of abnormal QTcF interval absolute values 
and changes were similar across treatments groups. A thorough QTc study has not been conducted with BGF 
MDI to support registration. This was considered by CHMP to be acceptable since modelling using the known 
effects of individual components was used to estimate the overall effect of the triple combination on QTc and 
if additional safety monitoring was undertaken in the clinical trials. Section 4.4 of the SmPC currently includes 
a warning that caution should also be exercised in patients with known or suspected prolongation of the QTc 
interval with cross reference a warning in section 4.5. regarding use with caution in patients being treated 
with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval.  At this point these warnings are sufficient.
Vital sign values
Bradycardia was reported more commonly in the BGF MDI, GFF MDI and BFF MDI treatment groups 
compared with Symbicort.  Reports remained consistently elevated over the longer term 52-week study. 
There were 2 SAEs of complete AV block one in BGF MDI group and 1 in the BFF treated group. Although 
there does appear to be an increased incidence of bradycardia events based on vital signs values in Studies 
PT01006, PT010008 and PT010007, this was comparable across BGF MDI, GFF MDI, BFF MDI, but tended to 
be higher than that seen for Symbicort TBH groups. However, this has not resulted in an increase in clinical 
reports of bradycardia. The overall reporting of AV block was also low. There is no evidence of a clinically 
relevant increase in bradycardia in these studies. In the Study PT010006 2.8% of all subjects and 3.5% of all 
subjects in the Safety Population in Study PT010008 reported SBP ≤90 mmHg with a decrease from baseline 
≥20 mmHg. Following a review of AEs that might be associated with low blood pressure There is no clear 
evidence that BGF MDI causes clinically significant drops in blood pressure.  However, it is noted that 
dizziness is an uncommon side effects which should be taken into account when driving or using machines. 
See proposed wording in section 4.7of the SmPC
Safety in special population
There were no notable safety findings for AEs across treatments in safety subgroups based on demographic 
subgroups (age, sex, and race) and by country or by baseline characteristics (COPD severity, CV history and 
smoking history 
Overall TEAEs and SAEs were reported more frequently in subjects >65. This may be attributable to 
increased morbidity seen in older age groups. Currently the SmPC recommends in section 4.2 that no dose 
adjustments are required in elderly patients. The confirmatory trials for BGF MDI for COPD included 343 
subjects aged 65 and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these 
subjects and younger subjects. Changes from baseline in BMD for the lumber spine were small and similar 
across treatment groups. No subjects shifted to T-score of ≤-2.5 at week 52. A worsening score in total hip 
BMD (≤-2.5) in the BGF MDI (5.8%) was similar to the BFF MDI (5.6%) group but higher compared with GFF 
(1.9%). The incidence of bone-related AEs was low and similar across treatment groups. There was no 
notable increase in fractures across the study treatment groups.
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with BGF MDI. Possible initial hypokalaemia may be 
potentiated by concomitant medications, including non-potassium sparing diuretics. There are no new signals 
from these data to suggest an adverse safety profile when budesonide, glycopyrronium and formoterol 
fumarate are used in a fixed dose combination concomitantly with other medications commonly used by 
patients with COPD. BGF MDI should be administered with caution to patients being treated with medicinal 
products known to prolong the QTc interval. Warnings regarding the risk of hypokalaemia, the metabolism of 
budesonide by CYP3A4, and co-administration of BGF MDI with other anticholinergic and/or long-acting β2-
adrenergic agonist containing medicinal products are included in section 4.5.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
Overall, the data shows evidence of well-known side effects associated with inhaled corticosteroid treatment. 
There was no evidence of an increase in side effects associated with anticholinergic or β2-agonist 
pharmacology effect. There was no evidence of an additive effect when the three actives are administered 
together as a fixed dose combination. Ocular side effects, in particular cases of cataract is of particular 
interest. Cardiac safety is of particular interest and it is recommended that the topic of MACEs occurring over 
longer term treatment in patients should continue to be closely monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
COPD is characterised by cough, dyspnoea on exertion or even at rest, with a consequent reduction of 
physical activity and deterioration of quality of life (QoL) (GOLD 2016). The inflammatory response 
contributes to small airways disease and emphysema, which in turn reduce the elastic recoil of the lungs 
leading to collapse and obstruction of the small airways during exhalation. Systemic features of COPD are 
very common (Barnes PJ and Celli BR 2009) and their evaluation allows a more accurate prediction of 
mortality risk and comorbidity risk than lung function alone (Cote CG et al. 2007, De Torres JP et al. 2009, 
Puhan MA et al. 2009).
During the natural course of COPD, the majority of patients develop acute episodes of worsening of 
symptoms that differ from the day to day variations and may require modifications in therapy (GOLD 2016). 
These episodes are referred to as exacerbations. COPD exacerbations are important because they are 
associated with accelerated FEV1 decline (Donaldson GC et al. 2002), significant morbidity, healthcare cost 
and mortality (Celli BR and Barnes PJ 2007).
According to the GOLD document, the assessment of the disease severity should take into account various 
aspects of the disease such as symptoms, degree of airflow limitation, exacerbation risk and comorbidities. 
Based on the overall disease severity, COPD patients can be divided into the following four groups:
 Group A (i.e. patients with low risk [of future events such as exacerbations, hospital admissions or 
death] and less symptoms);
 Group B (i.e. patients with low risk and more symptoms);
 Group C (i.e. patients with high risk and less symptoms);
 Group D (i.e. patients with high risk and more symptoms).
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
ICS/LABA combination products are considered key to the symptomatic management of COPD have been 
shown to improve lung function, health status, and to reduce COPD exacerbations compared with either 
agent alone. LAMAs have been shown to improve lung function, relieve symptoms, increase exercise 
capacity, improve quality of life, and reduce COPD exacerbations to a greater extent than short-acting 
bronchodilators. As disease severity increases, COPD treatment guidelines recommend an incremental 
approach to pharmacological treatment, involving the use of combinations of drug classes with different or 
complementary mechanisms of action (GOLD 2016).
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
The applicant performed two pivotal studies for the efficacy assessment supporting the use of BGF MDI in 
patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Study PT010006 was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-centre 
study to assess the efficacy and safety of BGF MDI (triple therapy), GFF MDI (Bevespi), and BFF MDI 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 221/238
 
 
compared with Symbicort Turbuhaler (open-label) as an active control in subjects with moderate to very 
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
A second pivotal study (PT010005), provided with the responses to major objections was a randomised, 
double-blind, multi-centre, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of BGF MDI (triple therapy) 
relative to GFF MDI (Bevespi) and BFF MDI on COPD exacerbations over a 52-week treatment period in 
subjects with moderate to very severe COPD. 
For this MAA, the applicant provided also the results of 28-week extension study (Study PT010008).
The main purpose of study PT010008 was the assessment of safety and tolerability in subjects with moderate 
to very severe COPD. The efficacy was investigated through the exploratory endpoints only without any 
hypothesis testing; therefore, this study has a limited value in the context of efficacy assessment.
In addition, the applicant provided 4 studies supporting the use of BFF MDI as a comparator in study in the 
pivotal study. 
The applicant conducted two studies (PT008001 and PT009001) in the phase 2 development to decide on the 
optimal dose for Budesonide (BD) in BFF MDI.
Study PT008001 was a randomised, double-blind, 4-period, 5-treatment, cross-over, multi-centre study in 
which four doses of BD e.g 320, 160, 80 and 40 μg were compared to placebo in patients with mild to 
moderate persistent asthma. 
Study PT009001 was phase IIb randomised, double-blind, chronic dosing (28 days), four-period, five-
treatment, incomplete block, multicentre, crossover study to assess the efficacy and safety of BFF MDI 
320/9.6, 160/9.6, and 80/9.6 μg BID, BD MDI 320 μg BID, and FF MDI 9.6 μg BID in subjects with moderate 
to severe COPD.
The phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, multi-centre, 24-week study PT009002 was 
conducted to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of BFF MDI 320/9.6 μg and BFF 160/9.6 μg 
compared with FF MDI 9.6 μg and BD MDI 320 μg on lung function (primary endpoints), as well as subject-
reported symptom outcomes and health status (secondary endpoints). In this study BFF MDI was also 
compared with Symbicort TBH for non- inferiority. 
Study PT009003 was a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, multi-centre, variable length 
efficacy and safety study comparing BFF MDI (320/9.6 μg and 160/9.6 μg) to FF MDI 9.6. The study was 
originally designed as a 52-week COPD lung function and exacerbation study however, the study design was 
modified to a variable length study ranging from 12 weeks to up to 52 weeks.
3.2.  Favourable effects
In the provided phase III studies, the efficacy of BGF MDI was compared to the LAMA/LABA combination (GFF 
MDI (Bevespi) and to the ICS/LABA combination (BFF MDI). In line with the FDC guidelines, superiority or 
‘add on efficacy’ can only be claimed to active substances to which patients have been demonstrated to be 
responding insufficiently to. Therefore, the superiority of BGF MDI is being analysed independently in relation 
to LAMA/LABA and ICS/LABA combinations.
In relation to comparison with LABA/LAMA therapy, for trough FEV1 level over 24 weeks, in study 
PT010006 BGF MDI demonstrated statistically significant improvements from baseline in morning predose 
trough FEV1 over 24 weeks compared with GFF MDI (LMS 22 mL; 95% CI 4-39; p=0.0139). In study 
PT010005 the improvements in trough FEV1 over 24 weeks were also small (43 mL)
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 222/238
 
 
In study PT010006 the exacerbation rate was significantly lower in the BGF MDI group versus GFF MDI group 
(rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.48 [0.37, 0.64], p<0.0001) however, this rate was only examined as a secondary 
endpoint and for 24 weeks only. BGF MDI demonstrated a nominally significant improvement in LS mean 
SGRQ total score over 24 weeks compared with GFF MDI (-1.22 units; 95% CI -2.30 to -0.15; p=0.0259). 
In study, PT010005 a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in the rate of moderate or 
severe COPD exacerbations for the BGF higher dose (320/14.4/9.6 ug) was reported in comparison to GFF 
MDI (rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.69, 0.83], p<0.0001).  The rate of moderate or severe COPD 
exacerbations the was primary endpoint of this study 52-week study. Also, in relation to the time to first 
moderate or severe COPD exacerbation statistically significant improvements were observed in the BGF MDI 
groups versus the GFF MDI group. For BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg relative to GFF MDI HR [95% CI] was 0.880 
[0.807, 0.959], p=0.0035)
Secondary endpoints results for study PT010005 were also supportive including change from baseline in 
SGRQ total score, TDI focal score over 24 weeks and change from baseline in average daily rescue Ventolin 
HFA use over 24 weeks. For all these endpoints statistically significant differences in favour of BGF MDI were 
reported. BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg resulted in statistically significant improvements in LS mean SGRQ total 
score over 24 weeks compared with GFF MDI (LS mean difference of -1.62 units; p<0.0001) For SGRQ total 
score also a statistically higher proportion of responders was reported in the BGF group as well. Subjects 
treated with BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg had statistically significantly improvements in LS mean TDI focal score 
over 24 weeks relative to GFF MDI (difference of 0.40 units; p<0.0001).
The risk of death (all cause) was nominally significantly lower during treatment with BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 μg relative to GFF MDI (HR [95% CI]; 0.544 [0.340, 0.870], p=0.0111).
In relation to comparison with ICS/LABA therapy, in study PT010006 BGF MDI demonstrated statistically 
significant improvement in FEV1 AUC0-4 over 24 weeks (104 mL; 95% CI 77 to 131; p<0.0001 for BGF MDI 
versus BFF MDI comparison and 91 mL; 95% CI 64 to 117; p<0.0001 for BGF MDI versus Symbicort TBH). 
Morning predose trough FEV1 over 24 weeks for BGF MDI as compared to BFF MDI and Symbicort TBH was 
examined as secondary endpoints and the observed difference was statistically significant (74 mL; p<0.0001 
for BGF MDI versus BFF MDI and 59 mL; p<0.0001 for BGF MDI versus Symbicort TBH).
In relation to patient reported outcomes, BGF MDI was statistically superior only to Symbicort TBH for TDI 
focal score (0.461 units; 95% CI 0.156 to 0.766; p=0.0031).
In study PT010005 similar improvements in lung function were seen. Nominally significant improvement was 
observed in in LS mean change from baseline morning predose trough FEV1 over 24 weeks in the BGF MDI 
group compared with BFF MDI (76 mL; p<0.0001) using the Efficacy Estimand. Improvements in the 
exacerbation rates were seen. A statistically significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe COPD 
exacerbations for the BGF higher dose (320/14.4/9.6 ug) versus BFF MDI were reported with the rate ratio 
[95% CI]: 0.87 [0.79, 0.95], p=0.0027).  This improvement could be considered as borderline clinically 
relevant as Chapman and coll. (2013) suggested that interventions reducing exacerbations by as little as 
11% may be considered as important. 
Also, in relation to the time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation statistically significant 
improvements were observed in the BGF MDI groups compared to BFF MDI. A reduction of the rate of severe 
exacerbation for BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg relative to BFF MDI HR [95% CI] was 0.887 [0.814, 0.966], 
p=0.0057).

Secondary endpoints results were also supportive including change from baseline in SGRQ total score, TDI 
focal score over 24 weeks and change from baseline in average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use over 24 weeks. 
For all these endpoints statistically significant differences in favour of BGF MDI were reported also for 
comparison with BFF MDI. 
BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg resulted in statistically significant improvements in LS mean SGRQ total score over 
24 weeks compared with BFF MDI (LS mean difference of -1.38 units; p<0.0001) using the Efficacy 
Estimand. For SGRQ total score also a statistically higher proportion of responders was reported in the BGF 
group versus the BFF MDI group (responders were defined as subjects achieving an MCID of ≥4 units in 
SGRQ total score).
Subjects treated with BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg had statistically significantly improvements in LS mean TDI 
focal score over 24 weeks relative to BFF MDI (difference of 0.31 units; p<0.0001) using the Efficacy 
Estimand. 
3.3.   Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
The design of study PT010006, selected primary endpoints and a strategy for controlling the type I error do 
not reflect the requirements of the guideline and were not sufficiently justified. According to the 
recommendations from the CHMP guideline on the investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of 
COPD (EMA/CHMP/483572/201), measurement of lung function parameters alone is considered to be 
insufficient in the assessment of therapeutic effect as the correlation between lung function and symptoms or 
exacerbations is poor. If lung function is selected as a primary endpoint, additional evidence of efficacy must 
be demonstrated through the use of a co-primary endpoint, which should either be a symptom-based 
endpoint or a patient-related endpoint. The guideline also states that number of exacerbations may be 
acceptable as a single primary endpoint, however the rate of exacerbation should be investigated over a 
period of at least one year due to seasonal variation in exacerbation rates.
However, with the responses the applicant submitted a new study PT010005 with a design in line with the 
regulatory guidelines. For this reason, it is considered that study PT010005 is the main study supporting this 
application.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
In Study PT010006, after 24 weeks treatment the incidences of the treatment emergent adverse events were 
generally similar between the treatment groups (BGF (60.7%), GFF (61.4%), BFF (55.7%), and Symbicort 
(59.6%). Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity. The most frequently reported SAES were COPD (3.7%) 
and pneumonia (0.8%); all other SAEs occurred in ≤0.3% of subjects overall.
In Study PT010008 after 52 weeks treatment the incidences of the treatment emergent adverse events were 
still generally similar between the treatment groups (BGF (74.2%), GFF (76.4%) and BFF (72.7%).
The overall incidence of SAEs was higher in the BGF MDI group (17%) compared with GFF MDI treated 
subjects (12.6%) and BFF MDI treated subjects (8.0%). Overall the most frequently reported SAEs were 
COPD (6.2% BGF MDI vs. 5.2% GFF MDI and 2.3% BFF MDI) and pneumonia (1% BGF MDI vs. 2.3% GFF 
MDI and 0% BFF MDI) 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 224/238
 
 
In Study PT010005, 1744 subjects (20.4%) reported treatment-emergent SAEs. The most frequently 
reported treatment-emergent SAEs overall were COPD (10.4%) and pneumonia (2.5%); all other treatment-
emergent SAEs occurred in ≤0.7% of subjects. The incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was generally 
similar across the treatment groups.
Cardiovascular risks
In Study PT010006 and Study PT010008, the incidence of events confirmed as MACE, as well as 
cardiovascular SAEs in general, was low with some variability across treatment groups. In PT01006 
exposure-adjusted adverse event rate for MACE was 7.2, 11.3, 15.1 and 14.6 in the BGF MDI, GFF MDI, BFF 
MDI and Symbicort treatment groups respectively. In PT010008 Exposure-adjusted rate of adverse events 
confirmed as MACE was similar between the BGF MDI and GFF MDI treatment groups (18.5 and 20.3 events 
per 1000 person-years, respectively. There were no events confirmed as MACE for subjects in the BFF MDI 
treatment group. However, exposure-adjusted adverse event rate for MACE overall was notably higher in 
Study PT010008 (18.5 events per 1000 person–years) compared with Study PT010006 (11.1 events per 
1000 person-years). 
In Study PT010005 a total of 128 subjects (1.5%) had events confirmed as MACE, as determined by the CEC. 
The most frequently reported events overall confirmed as MACE were cardiovascular death and non-fatal MI 
(0.6% each).
Exposure-adjusted rate of adverse events confirmed as MACE were highest in the GFF MDI group (26.6 
events per 1000 person-years) and similar across the BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg, BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg, 
and BFF MDI groups (range: 13.1 to 16.9 events per 1000 person-years). Additionally, confirmed MACE 
incidences were similar (0.8%) within treatment groups from 0 to ≤24 weeks and >24 weeks.)
Mean changes from baseline in the heart rate, PR interval and Fridericia’s corrected QT (QTcF) interval were 
small and similar across treatment groups. A total of 4.0% of all subjects in the PT010006 Safety Population 
(BGF MDI 4.1% vs GFF MDI 5.1% vs BFF MDI 3.8% and Symbicort TBH 1.9%) and 6.1% of all subjects in 
the Safety Population in Study PT010008 (BGF MDI 6.7% vs GFF MDI 4.6% BFF MDI 8.0%) reported 
bradycardia. 
Overall 0.3% of all subjects in the Study PT010006 Safety Population (BGF MDI 0.5%; GFF MDI 0.2%; BFF 
MDI 0.6% and Symbicort 0%) and 1.3% of subjects in the Safety Population in Study PT010008 (BGF MDI 
1.5% ; GFF MDI 0.6% ;BFF MDI 2.3%) had QTcF values that were >500 msec and had  increased by ≥60 
msec from baseline .
Four of thirteen deaths in BGF/GFF/BFF MDI treated populations were considered to be of cardiac origin. 2 
subjects in the BGF MDI treatment group (preferred terms: acute MI and cerebral infarction) and 2 subjects 
in the GFF MDI treatment group (preferred term: cardio-respiratory arrest and myocardial ischaemia).
Steroid-related safety risks
The incidence of oral candidiasis was <2% across all treatment groups in Study PT010006. An increased 
incidence of oral candidiasis was noted in the BGF MDI and BFF MDI treatment group compared with the 
other treatment groups. Over the 52-week treatment period the incidence of oral candidiasis was 2.5% for 
BGF MDI, 2% for GFF MDI and 1.4% for BFF MDI treated subjects. Dysphonia was the most common drug-
related side effect overall and for all for the ICS treatments over 24 weeks in Study PT010006 and 52 weeks 
in study PT010008. In study PT010005 3.2% subjects treated with BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg reported AEs of 
candidiasis. 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 225/238
 
 
A total of 3% of BGF MDI treated subjects and 4.1% of the BFF MDI treated subjects compared with 1.6% of 
the Symbicort TBH and 0.5% reported drug related dysphonia as a side effect. In study PT010008 2.1% of 
BGF MDI treated subjects and 0.6% of the GFF MDI treated subjects compared with 5.7% of the BFF MDI 
treated group reported drug related dysphonia as a side effect. In Study PT010005 1.8%, of subjects treated 
with BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg, 1.3%, for BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg, 1.5%, for BFF MDI and 0.3% for GFF 
MDI  reported dysphonia as a side effect.
Changes from baseline in BMD for the lumber spine were small and similar across treatment groups. No 
subjects shifted to T-score of ≤-2.5 at week 52. A worsening score in total hip BMD (≤-2.5) in the BGF MDI 
(5.8%) was similar to the BFF MDI (5.6%) group but higher compared with GFF (1.9%).
The observed geometric mean ratio to Baseline in 0-24-hour mean serum cortisol was similar across the BGF 
MDI, GFF MDI, and open-label Symbicort TBH treatment groups (0.86, 0.94, and 0.94, respectively). The 
observed geometric mean ratio to Baseline in 0-24-hour mean serum cortisol was 0.73 for BFF MDI.
Potentially clinically significant reports of hyperglycaemia and TEAEs of hyperglycaemia were low overall and 
were similar across treatment groups.
Pneumonia
In study PT010006 (treatment up to 24 weeks) the adverse event rate of CEC confirmed pneumonia events 
overall was low overall but was slightly higher in BGF MDI (1.9%) and BFF MDI (1.9%) groups compared with 
GFF MDI (1.6%) and Symbicort (1.3%) treated patients. The exposure-adjusted adverse event rate of 
confirmed pneumonia events across the treatment groups over the 24-week treatment period were GFF 
MDI:37.8, BGF MDI: 43.3, and BFF MDI: 45.4 and Symbicort 29.3 events per 1000 person-years. The 
exposure-adjusted adverse event rate of confirmed pneumonia events across the treatment groups over 52 
weeks were GFF MDI :40.6, BGF MDI: 24.7, and BFF MDI: 13.9 events per 1000 person-years. The overall 
trend suggests a decrease in cases of pneumonia over longer term treatment with BGF MDI and BFF MDI 
compared with GFF MDI.
For Study PT010005 incidence of confirmed pneumonia was 3.6%:  by treatment group, (4.2% for BGF MDI 
320/14.4/9.6 μg, 3.5% for BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg; 4.5% for BFF MDI; 2.3%,  GFF MDI group. Confirmed 
pneumonia incidence did not increase within or across treatment groups from 0 to ≤24 weeks (range: 1.4% 
to 2.0%) relative to >24 weeks (range: 1.0% to 2.8%).
Exacerbation of COPD
Over 24 weeks exposure in Study PT010006 COPD was the commonest SAE and occurred at similar 
incidences in BGF and BFF group but at lower incidences than the GFF MDI group and Symbicort groups 
(2.7% (61.3E/1000PY) and 2.5% (60.5E/1000PY) vs 5.1% (155 E/1000PY) and 4.1% (117.2 E / 1000PYs 
respectively).
Over 52 weeks (Study PT010008) across treatment groups the percentage of subjects reporting an event of 
COPD was higher in the BGF MDI group (6.2%(80.2E/1000PY)) compared with GFF (5.2%(74.4E/1000PY)) 
and BFF MDI groups (1.1% (13.9E/1000PY)).
Over 52 weeks in Study PT010005 the most frequently reported severe TEAE was COPD 10.4%; the 
incidence of severe TEAEs of COPD was similar across treatment groups (range: 9.4% to 11.3%
Acute respiratory failure occurred at higher incidence in BGF MDI treated group (0.6%) compared with GFF 
MDI group (0.2%) BFF MDI group (0.0%) and Symbicort groups (0.1%).

Deaths
Thirteen deaths were reported overall in Studies PT010006 and PT010008. In the 24 weeks’ analysis for 
PT010006, 12 patients died overall; 6 (0.9%) in the BGF MDI group, 3 (0.5%) in the GFF MDI group, 2 
(0.6%) in the BFF MDI group, and 1 (0.3%) in the open-label Symbicort TBH group in the BGF MDI group. 
One additional death was reported during the treatment period of study PT010008.
In Study PT010005,  112 subjects (1.3%) experienced on-treatment AEs with an outcome of death as 
reported by the Investigator; the incidence was lowest in the BGF MDI 320/14.4/9.6 μg group (0.9%), 
followed by the BGF MDI 160/14.4/9.6 μg (1.3%), BFF MDI (1.4%), and GFF MDI (1.6%) groups. On-
treatment AEs with an outcome of death were most commonly confirmed through adjudication as due to 
cardiovascular (0.6%) and respiratory (0.3%) causes. No other causes were reported by >0.2% of subjects 
overall.
Gastrointestinal side effects
There were two reports of pancreatitis one each in the BGF and GFF treatment groups respectively.
Ocular side effects
General concerns relating to the potential for an adverse impact on ocular safety in patients treated with ICS 
are well established and studies in the available medical literature have shown that the use of higher doses 
and longer duration of ICS is associated with the prevalence of cataracts in COPD patients. There is also an 
increasing awareness in the medical literature about the role of cataract as a comorbid condition of COPD.
The applicant has specifically evaluated the potential effects of BGF MDI on ophthalmologic assessment 
parameters in Study PT010008 (28-week extension of Study PT010006) which included an ophthalmologic 
population of 311 patients.
The overall percentage of patients with LOCS III grade increases was higher for all groups at Week 52 when 
compared to week 24, with grades in the BGF MDI group increasing from 7.1% at 24 weeks to 11.4% at end 
of treatment (BGF 11.4%, BFF 7.9%, and GFF 4.7% versus Week 24= BGF 7.1%, BFF 2.8%, and GFF 1.1%). 
The increased proportion of subjects with a LOCS III Class 3 increase at Week 52 and the end of treatment is 
not due primarily to subjects worsening over time and also is not limited to the BGF MDI group. Furthermore, 
the presence of multiple confounding factors in these cases are noted. A total of 278 subjects (61% of the 
Safety Population) had an ophthalmologic risk factor of relevance including family history of cataract 
(34.6%), outdoor occupation more than 2 years (22.4%), and treatment with ophthalmic or systemic 
steroids (14.5%), which were generally similar across treatment groups (Study PT010008). 
The overall changes from baseline in IOP were low and similar in the BGF MDI and GFF MDI treatment groups 
at Week 52 (each 0.7%), and slightly lower in the BFF MDI group (0.2%). In the BGF MDI group, the 
percentage of patients with an increase of >7mm IOP at 28 weeks was 2.4%. This increased to 4.4% at 52 
weeks. A similar trend was noted in the BFF group (2% at 28 weeks versus 4% at 52 weeks). No major 
differences were noted across both ICS groups.
In terms of ocular safety, it is noted that ocular ADRs, while relatively low, did tend to increase over time in 
both ICS groups. In the BGF MDI group, ocular ADRs increased from 1.3% at 24 weeks to 8.1% at 52 weeks. 
In the BFF MDI group, these increased from 2.9% at 24 weeks to 7.1% at 52 weeks. The incidence of IOP 
increased was also slightly higher after Week 24 than during the first 24 weeks of the study (1.9% vs 0).
For the Safety Population in Study PT010008, the incidence of cataract and increased IOP reported with BGF 
MDI was 1.8% and 1.5% respectively. 
Assessment report 
EMA/582495/2020
Page 227/238
 
 
Over the 52-week treatment period, cataract was listed as one of the most frequently reported AESI 
preferred terms. The overall incidence of cataract reported in the BGF MDI group (3.1%) was higher than the 
BFF MDI group (2.3%).  
Ocular ADRs reported with BGF MDI are reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC
The information on ocular safety and ocular ADRs relating to BGF MDI was strengthened for patients and 
physicians in the SmPC to reflect the available data and in line with PRAC recommendation on warnings 
concerning the possible ocular effects associated with use of steroids.
Overall, the AE profile of BGF MDI was shown to be consistent with what is expected for an ICS, 
anticholinergic, and β2-agonist combination product and there were no new or unexpected safety signals 
identified.
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
A relatively small subset of patients from study PT010006 was treated for 52 weeks. Of the 1902 subjects 
who were randomised to study treatment in PT010006, 456 subjects (excluding subjects treated with 
Symbicort TBH) were eligible to continue from Study PT010006 into PT010008. A total of 337 subjects 
completed treatment up to 52 weeks of which total of 142 subjects were exposed to BGF MDI for at least 12 
months in Study PT010008. This is mitigated by the fact that the safety profiles of the active agents have 
been previously described in both in combination and as monocomponents. In addition, two 52 weeks studies 
(Study PT010007, an extension study in Japanese COPD patients who participated in Study PT010006 and 
Study PT010005 (Ethos), a 52-week COPD exacerbation study have been completed. 
In study PT010006 the majority of subjects were enrolled in the US (51.3%), followed by China (22.7%), 
Japan (21.9%), and Canada (4.1%).  Study PT010008 was conducted in the US. In Study PT010005 the 
majority of subjects were randomised in the US (35.8%), Germany (13.9%), and Argentina (9.3%).
The demographic and baseline characteristics profile of the subset of subjects that progressed to Study 
PT010008 were different to the overall PT010006 profile. In Study PT010008 compared to PT010006 overall a 
higher proportion of subjects were < 65years (58% vs 45%) , mean BMI was higher (29kg/m2 vs 26kg/m2), 
a higher proportion of subjects used ICS at baseline (77% vs 72%) ,were current smokers (52% vs 40%) , 
were adversely impacted by their COPD as measured by CAT(CAT score 21 vs 18) and had a baseline 
eosinophil count ≥150 cells per mm3 (66% vs 52%).
In Study PT010005 the overall mean age at baseline was 64.7 years. Overall a higher proportion of subjects 
were > 65years (52% vs 48%). Total CAT score at baseline was 19.6 and was similar across the treatment 
groups. Overall, 56.5% of subjects had a history of ≥2 moderate or severe COPD exacerbations occurring in 
the 12 months prior to screening. Greater than 80% were using ICS at screening. The percentage of subjects 
with a blood eosinophil count≥150 cells/mm3 was 59.9%.
No data have been presented regarding safety of BFG MDI during pregnancy and lactation or in subjects with 
renal or hepatic impairment.
The applicant has clarified how the ADR table for section 4.8 was compiled and how the ADR frequencies 
were calculated. Following completion of Study PT010005 and a review of the pooled safety the following 
additional ADRs were identified:  Hyperglycaemia, headache, anxiety, insomnia Urinary tract infection, 
Pneumonia (changed to Common). The term ‘Contusion’ was changed to ‘Bruising’ (same frequency).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
The requirements of the CHMP guideline on the investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of COPD 
are considered as fulfilled, as in study PT010005 a statistically significant reduction in the rate of moderate or 
severe COPD exacerbations for the BGF dose (320/14.4/9.6 ug) was reported relative to both GFF MDI (rate 
ratio [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.69, 0.83], p<0.0001) and BFF MDI rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.87 [0.79, 0.95], 
p=0.0027). These reductions could each be considered as clinically relevant, although a smaller treatment 
effect was seen in comparison to BFF MDI. 
In the 24-week PT010006 study, BGF MDI significantly reduced the annualised rate of on-treatment 
moderate/severe exacerbations by 52% (95% CI: 36, 63; p<0.0001) compared with GFF MDI. 
Improvements compared with BFF MDI and BFF TBH did not reach statistical significance.
The results of other endpoints investigated in these pivotal studies were provided as supportive evidence. 
Effects on lung function were investigated in both pivotal studies. In both studies BGF MDI improved on-
treatment lung function (FEV1) compared with GFF MDI and BFF MDI, although improvements as compared 
to GFF MDI were small. Change from baseline in SGRQ total score, TDI focal score over 24 weeks and change 
from baseline in average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use over 24 weeks were assessed as secondary 
endpoints. For these endpoints statistically significant improvements were observed for BGF MDI compared to 
GFF MDI and BFF MDI in the study PT010005, whereas in study PT010006 statistically significant 
improvements as compared were only reported for TDI focal score and in comparison to BFF TBH only. 
Therefore it is considered that the provided data support the use of BGF MDI as a maintenance treatment in 
adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not 
adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long acting β2 agonist or combination 
of a long-acting β2 agonist and a long acting muscarinic antagonist.
The AE profile of BGF MDI was generally consistent with the known side effect profile of ICS, long acting β2-
agonist and anticholinergic inhalers used in the treatment of COPD. There were no new or unexpected clear 
safety signals identified. There was no clear evidence of an additive effect from combining the three 
treatments in one fixed dose combination inhaler or of a clinically significant cumulative effect over longer 
term treatment, however there were some safety concerns regarding increases in ocular side effects over 
longer term treatment. There was a trend towards increased reporting of known side effects, mostly those of 
the ICS component, in the BGF MDI treated population compared to Symbicort over 24 weeks, however these 
differences were generally small and unlikely to be of clinical significance. An increased incidence of 
treatment-emergent SAEs, treatment-emergent COPD SAEs, and on-treatment deaths in Study PT010005 are 
explained by the longer study duration and increased severity of COPD in subjects enrolled in Study 
PT010005 compared with Study PT010006.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
It is considered that the provided data support the use of BGF MDI as a maintenance treatment in adult 
patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately 
treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2 agonist or combination of a long-
acting β2 agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist. BGF MDI is a fixed dose combination of active 
substances, which have been used in the treatment of COPD for many years. 
The AE profile of BGF MDI was consistent with what is expected for an ICS, anticholinergic, and β2-agonist, 
and there were no new or unexpected clear safety signals identified. The safety data from the original Phase 
III programme for BGF MDI do not suggest an additive effect from combination of the three active 
substances on cardiovascular adverse effects. The risk of serious adverse effects increases with the duration 
of the treatment up to the one year for subjects treated with BGF MDI, but this seems to be mainly driven by 
increases in exacerbation of COPD. In Study PT010005, conducted over 52 weeks in >8000 patients, there 
was an increased reporting rate of SAEs and overall rate of death in this study compared to Study PT010006. 
This was explained by the longer duration of the study and enrolment of subjects with more severe COPD. 
Reports of MACE were low and there was no evidence of an increase over longer term treatment with BGF 
MDI. MACE will be monitored closely by the applicant and reassessed at the time of renewal.  
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall B/R of Trixeo Aerosphere is positive.
4.  Recommendations
Outcome

benefit-risk balance of Trixeo Aerosphere is favourable in the following indication:
Trixeo Aerosphere is indicated as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled 
corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist or combination of a long-acting β2-agonist and a long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1).

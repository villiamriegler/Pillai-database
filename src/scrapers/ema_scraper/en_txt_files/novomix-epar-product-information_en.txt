CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
NovoMix 30 is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 
10 years and above. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The potency of insulin analogues, including insulin aspart, is expressed in units, whereas the potency 
of human insulin is expressed in international units. 
NovoMix 30 dosing is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. Blood 
glucose monitoring and insulin dose adjustments are recommended to achieve optimal glycaemic 
control. 
In patients with type 2 diabetes, NovoMix 30 can be given as monotherapy. NovoMix 30 can also be 
given in combination with oral antidiabetic medicinal products and/or GLP-1 receptor agonists. For 
patients with type 2 diabetes, the recommended starting dose of NovoMix 30 is 6 units at breakfast and 
6 units at dinner (evening meal). NovoMix 30 can also be initiated once daily with 12 units at dinner 
(evening meal). When using NovoMix 30 once daily, it is generally recommended to move to twice 
daily when reaching 30 units by splitting the dose into equal breakfast and dinner doses. If twice daily 
dosing with NovoMix 30 results in recurrent daytime hypoglycaemic episodes, the morning dose can 
be split into morning and lunchtime doses (thrice daily dosing).

The lowest of the three previous days’ pre-meal blood glucose levels should be used. The dose should 
not be increased if hypoglycaemia occurred within these days. Dose adjustments can be made once a 
week until target HbA1c is reached. Pre-meal blood glucose levels should be used to evaluate the 
adequacy of the preceding dose. 
In patients with type 2 diabetes, a dose reduction of 20% is recommended for patients with an HbA1c 
less than 8% when a GLP-1 receptor agonist is added to NovoMix 30, to minimise the risk of 
hypoglycaemia. For patients with an HbA1c higher than 8% a dose reduction should be considered. 
Subsequently, dosage should be adjusted individually. 
In patients with type 1 diabetes, the individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.5 and 
1.0 unit/kg/day. NovoMix 30 may fully or partially meet this requirement. 
Adjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their 
usual diet or during concomitant illness. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥65 years old) 
NovoMix 30 can be used in elderly patients; however there is limited experience with the use of 
NovoMix 30 in combination with oral antidiabetic medicinal products in patients older than 75 years. 
In elderly patients, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin aspart dose adjusted on an 
individual basis. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements. 
In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin 
aspart dose adjusted on an individual basis. 
Paediatric population 
NovoMix 30 can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above when premixed insulin 
is preferred. There is limited clinical experience with NovoMix 30 in children aged 6–9 years (see 
section 5.1).  
No data are available for NovoMix 30 in children below 6 years of age. 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products 
When transferring a patient from biphasic human insulin to NovoMix 30, start with the same dose and 
regimen. Then titrate according to individual needs (see the titration guideline in the table above). 
Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the initial weeks thereafter (see 
section 4.4). 
Method of administration 
NovoMix 30 is a biphasic suspension of the insulin analogue, insulin aspart. The suspension contains 
rapid-acting and intermediate-acting insulin aspart in the ratio 30/70. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NovoMix 30 is for subcutaneous administration only.  
NovoMix 30 is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh or in the abdominal wall. If 
convenient, the gluteal or deltoid region may be used. Injection sites should always be rotated within 
the same region in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see sections 
4.4 and 4.8). The influence of different injection sites on the absorption of NovoMix 30 has not been 
investigated. The duration of action will vary according to the dose, injection site, blood flow, 
temperature and level of physical activity. 
NovoMix 30 has a faster onset of action than biphasic human insulin and should generally be given 
immediately before a meal. When necessary, NovoMix 30 can be given soon after a meal. 
For detailed user instructions, please refer to the package leaflet. 
NovoMix 30 Penfill 
Administration with an insulin delivery system 
NovoMix 30 Penfill is designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine 
or NovoTwist needles. NovoMix 30 Penfill is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a 
reusable pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. 
NovoMix 30 FlexPen 
Administration with FlexPen 
NovoMix 30 FlexPen is a pre-filled pen (colour-coded) designed to be used with NovoFine or 
NovoTwist needles. FlexPen delivers 1–60 units in increments of 1 unit. NovoMix 30 FlexPen is only 
suitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
NovoMix 30 must not be administered intravenously, as it may result in severe hypoglycaemia. 
Intramuscular administration should be avoided. NovoMix 30 is not to be used in insulin infusion 
pumps. 
Before travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctor’s advice since this 
may mean that the patient has to take the insulin and meals at different times. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Inadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to 
hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Usually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop 
gradually over a period of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, 
vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. 
In type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is 
potentially lethal. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Omission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia.  
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case 
of hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected, NovoMix must not be injected. After stabilisation 
of the patient’s blood glucose, adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 
4.9). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Compared with biphasic human insulin, NovoMix 30 may have a more pronounced glucose lowering 
effect up to 6 hours after injection. This may have to be compensated for in the individual patient 
through adjustment of insulin dose and/or food intake. 
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may 
experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised 
accordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. 
Tighter control of glucose levels can increase the potential for hypoglycaemic episodes and therefore 
require special attention during dose intensification as outlined in section 4.2. 
Since NovoMix 30 should be administered in immediate relation to a meal, the rapid onset of action 
should be considered in patients with concomitant diseases or treatment where a delayed absorption of 
food might be expected. 
Concomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient’s 
insulin requirements. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or 
thyroid gland can require changes in the insulin dose. 
When patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning 
symptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with their 
previous insulin. 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products  
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal insulin, human insulin or 
insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may 
result in the need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to NovoMix 30 from another type of insulin 
may require an increased number of daily injections or a change in dose from that used with their usual 
insulin medicinal products. If an adjustment is needed, it may occur with the first dose or during the 
first few weeks or months. 
Injection site reactions  
As with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, 
inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given 
area reduces the risk of developing these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of NovoMix 30. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site from an affected to an 
unaffected area, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Combination of NovoMix with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and NovoMix is considered. If the combination 
is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.

Avoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors 
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental 
mix-ups between NovoMix and other insulin products. 
Insulin antibodies 
Insulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin 
antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or 
hypoglycaemia. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism. 
The following substances may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements: 
Oral antidiabetic medicinal products, GLP-1 receptor agonists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), 
beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids and 
sulfonamides. 
The following substances may increase the patient’s insulin requirements: 
Oral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth 
hormone and danazol. 
Beta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
Octreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. 
Alcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
There is limited clinical experience with NovoMix 30 in pregnancy. 
Animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human 
insulin regarding embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 
In general, intensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are 
recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually 
fall in the first trimester and increase subsequently during the second and third trimesters. After 
delivery, insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy levels. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 30 during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the 
nursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the NovoMix 30 dose may need to be adjusted.

Fertility 
Animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human 
insulin regarding fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or 
operating machinery). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving or operating a 
machine. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning 
signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving or 
operating a machine should be considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions observed in patients using NovoMix are mainly due to the pharmacological effect of 
insulin aspart. 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia. The frequencies of 
hypoglycaemia vary with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control, please see 
Description of selected adverse reactions below. 
At the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies, oedema and injection site reactions 
(pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur. 
These reactions are usually of a transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be 
associated with acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy 
with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of 
diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of 
diabetic retinopathy.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions listed below are based on clinical trial data and classified according to MedDRA 
frequency and System Organ Class. Frequency categories are defined according to the following 
convention: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Anaphylactic reactions:  
The occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, 
sweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulties in breathing, palpitation and 
reduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life-threatening. 
Hypoglycaemia: 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too 
high in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or 
convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. 
The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale 
skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty 
in concentrating, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation.  
In clinical trials, the frequency of hypoglycaemia varied with patient population, dose regimens and 
level of glycaemic control. During clinical trials, the overall rates of hypoglycaemia did not differ 
between patients treated with insulin aspart compared to human insulin. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: 
Lipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the 
injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the 
given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Based on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse 
reactions observed in the paediatric population do not indicate any differences to the broader 
experience in the general population. 
Other special populations 
Based on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse 
reactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate 
any differences to the broader experience in the general population. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
A specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over 
sequential stages if too high doses relative to the patient’s requirement are administered: 
• 
• 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary 
products. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing 
products. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with 
glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with 
glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously, 
if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining 
consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in order to 
prevent a relapse.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, intermediate- 
or long-acting combined with fast-acting. ATC code: A10AD05. 
NovoMix 30 is a biphasic suspension of 30% soluble insulin aspart (rapid-acting human insulin 
analogue) and 70% protamine-crystallised insulin aspart (intermediate-acting human insulin analogue). 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin aspart is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following 
binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose 
output from the liver. 
NovoMix 30 is a biphasic insulin, which contains 30% soluble insulin aspart. This has a rapid onset of 
action, thus allowing it to be given closer to a meal (within zero to 10 minutes of the meal) when 
compared to soluble human insulin. The crystalline phase (70%) consists of protamine-crystallised 
insulin aspart, which has an activity profile similar to that of human NPH insulin. 
When NovoMix 30 is injected subcutaneously, the onset of action will occur within 10 to 20 minutes 
of injection. The maximum effect is exerted between 1 and 4 hours after injection. The duration of 
action is up to 24 hours (Figure 1).

Clinical efficacy and safety 
In a 3 month trial in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, NovoMix 30 showed equal control of 
glycosylated haemoglobin compared to treatment with biphasic human insulin 30. Insulin aspart is 
equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis. Compared to biphasic human insulin 30, administration 
of NovoMix 30 before breakfast and dinner resulted in lower postprandial blood glucose after both 
meals (breakfast and dinner). 
A meta-analysis including nine trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes showed that fasting 
blood glucose was higher in patients treated with NovoMix 30, than in patients treated with biphasic 
human insulin 30. 
In one study, 341 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomised to treatment with NovoMix 30 either 
alone or in combination with metformin, or to metformin together with sulfonylurea. The primary 
efficacy variable - HbA1c after 16 weeks of treatment - did not differ between patients with NovoMix 
30 combined with metformin and patients with metformin plus sulfonylurea. In this trial, 57% of the 
patients had baseline HbA1c above 9%; in these patients, treatment with NovoMix 30 in combination 
with metformin resulted in significantly lower HbA1c than metformin in combination with 
sulfonylurea. 
In one study, patients with type 2 diabetes, insufficiently controlled on oral hypoglycaemic agents 
alone, were randomised to treatment with twice daily NovoMix 30 (117 patients) or once daily insulin 
glargine (116 patients). After 28 weeks of treatment following the dosing guideline outlined in section 
4.2, the mean reduction in HbA1c was 2.8% with NovoMix 30 (mean at baseline = 9.7%). With 
NovoMix 30, 66% and 42% of the patients reached HbA1c levels below 7% and 6.5%, respectively, 
and mean FPG was reduced by about 7 mmol/l (from 14.0 mmol/l at baseline to 7.1 mmol/l). 
In patients with type 2 diabetes, a meta-analysis showed a reduced risk of overall nocturnal 
hypoglycaemic episodes and major hypoglycaemia with NovoMix 30 compared to biphasic human 
insulin 30. The risk of overall daytime hypoglycaemic episodes was increased in patients treated with 
NovoMix 30. 
Paediatric population 
A 16-week clinical trial comparing postprandial glycaemic control of meal-related NovoMix 30 with 
meal-related human insulin/biphasic human insulin 30 and bedtime NPH insulin was performed in 
167 patients aged 10 to 18 years. Mean HbA1c remained similar to baseline throughout the trial in both 
treatment groups, and there was no difference in hypoglycaemia rate with NovoMix 30 or biphasic 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
human insulin 30. 
In a smaller (54 patients) and younger (age range 6 to 12 years) population, treated in a double-blind, 
cross-over trial (12 weeks on each treatment), the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes and the postprandial 
glucose increase were significantly lower with NovoMix 30 compared to biphasic human insulin 30. 
Final HbA1c was significantly lower in the biphasic human insulin 30 treated group compared with 
NovoMix 30. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption, distribution and elimination 
In insulin aspart, substitution of amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 reduces the 
tendency to form hexamers as observed with soluble human insulin. The insulin aspart in the soluble 
phase of NovoMix 30 comprises 30% of the total insulin; this is absorbed more rapidly from the 
subcutaneous layer than the soluble insulin component of biphasic human insulin. The remaining 70% 
is in crystalline form as protamine-crystallised insulin aspart; this has a prolonged absorption profile 
similar to human NPH insulin. 
The maximum serum insulin concentration is, on average, 50% higher with NovoMix 30 than with 
biphasic human insulin 30. The time to maximum concentration is, on average, half of that for biphasic 
human insulin 30. In healthy volunteers, a mean maximum serum concentration of 140 ± 32 pmol/l 
was reached about 60 minutes after a subcutaneous dose of 0.20 unit/kg body weight. The mean half 
life (t½) of NovoMix 30, reflecting the absorption rate of the protamine bound fraction, was about 8–
9 hours. Serum insulin levels returned to baseline 15–18 hours after a subcutaneous dose. In type 2 
diabetic patients, the maximum concentration was reached about 95 minutes after dosing, and 
concentrations well above zero for not less than 14 hours post-dosing were measured. 
Special populations 
The pharmacokinetics of NovoMix 30 have not been investigated in elderly patients or in patients with 
renal or hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of NovoMix 30 have not been investigated in children or adolescents. However, 
the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of soluble insulin aspart have been investigated 
in children (6–12 years) and adolescents (13–17 years) with type 1 diabetes. Insulin aspart was rapidly 
absorbed in both age groups, with similar tmax as in adults. However, Cmax differed between the age 
groups, stressing the importance of the individual titration of insulin aspart. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. 
In in vitro tests, including binding to insulin and IGF-1 receptor sites and effects on cell growth, 
insulin aspart behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate that 
the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin aspart is equivalent to human insulin.

3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Suspension for injection. 
The suspension is cloudy, white and aqueous. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
NovoMix 50 is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The potency of insulin analogues, including insulin aspart, is expressed in units, whereas the potency 
of human insulin is expressed in international units. 
NovoMix 50 dosing is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. Blood 
glucose monitoring and insulin dose adjustments are recommended to achieve optimal glycaemic 
control. 
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.5 and 1.0 unit/kg/day. NovoMix 50 may fully 
or partially meet this requirement.  
In patients with type 2 diabetes, NovoMix 50 can be given as monotherapy or in combination with 
metformin when the blood glucose is inadequately controlled with metformin alone. 
Adjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their 
usual diet or during concomitant illness.

Special populations 
In elderly patients (≥65 years old) and in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, glucose monitoring 
should be intensified and the insulin aspart dose adjusted on an individual basis.  
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of NovoMix 50 in children below 18 years of age have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products 
Transfer to NovoMix 50 from other insulin preparations may require adjustment of dose and timing of 
administration. Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the initial weeks 
thereafter (see section 4.4). 
Method of administration 
NovoMix 50 is a biphasic suspension of the insulin analogue, insulin aspart. The suspension contains 
rapid-acting and intermediate-acting insulin aspart in the ratio 50/50. 
NovoMix 50 is for subcutaneous administration only. 
NovoMix 50 is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh or in the abdominal wall. If 
convenient, the gluteal or deltoid region may be used. Injection sites should always be rotated within 
the same region in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see sections 
4.4 and 4.8). The influence of different injection sites on the absorption of NovoMix 50 has not been 
investigated. The duration of action will vary according to the dose, injection site, blood flow, 
temperature and level of physical activity.  
NovoMix 50 has a faster onset of action than biphasic human insulin and should generally be given 
immediately before a meal. When necessary, NovoMix 50 can be given soon after a meal. 
For detailed user instructions, please refer to the package leaflet. 
NovoMix 50 Penfill 
Administration with an insulin delivery system 
NovoMix 50 Penfill is designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine 
or NovoTwist needles. NovoMix 50 Penfill is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a 
reusable pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. 
NovoMix 50 FlexPen 
Administration with FlexPen 
NovoMix 50 FlexPen is a pre-filled pen (colour-coded) designed to be used with NovoFine or 
NovoTwist needles. FlexPen delivers 1–60 units in increments of 1 unit. NovoMix 50 FlexPen is only 
suitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
NovoMix 50 must not be administered intravenously, as it may result in severe hypoglycaemia. 
Intramuscular administration should be avoided. NovoMix 50 is not to be used in insulin infusion 
pumps. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctor’s advice since this 
may mean that the patient has to take the insulin and meals at different times. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Inadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to 
hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Usually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop 
gradually over a period of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, 
vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. 
In type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is 
potentially lethal. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Omission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case 
of hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected, NovoMix must not be injected. After stabilisation 
of the patient’s blood glucose, adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 
4.9). 
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may 
experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised 
accordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. 
Since NovoMix 50 should be administered in immediate relation to a meal, the rapid onset of action 
should be considered in patients with concomitant diseases or treatment where a delayed absorption of 
food might be expected. 
Concomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient’s 
insulin requirements. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or 
thyroid gland can require changes in the insulin dose. 
When patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning 
symptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with their 
previous insulin. 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal insulin, human insulin or 
insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may 
result in the need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to NovoMix 50 from another type of insulin 
may require an increased number of daily injections or a change in dose from that used with their usual 
insulin medicinal products. If an adjustment is needed, it may occur with the first dose or during the 
first few weeks or months. 
Injection site reactions 
As with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, 
inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given 
area reduces the risk of developing these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of NovoMix 50. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site from an affected to an 
unaffected area, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Combination of NovoMix with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and NovoMix is considered. If the combination 
is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Avoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors 
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental 
mix-ups between NovoMix and other insulin products. 
Insulin antibodies 
Insulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin 
antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or 
hypoglycaemia. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism. 
The following substances may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements: 
Oral antidiabetic medicinal products, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), beta-blockers, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids and sulfonamides. 
The following substances may increase the patient’s insulin requirements: 
Oral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth 
hormone and danazol. 
Beta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
Octreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. 
Alcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is limited clinical experience with NovoMix 50 in pregnancy. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human 
insulin regarding embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 
In general, intensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are 
recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually 
fall in the first trimester and increase subsequently during the second and third trimesters. After 
delivery, insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy levels. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 50 during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the 
nursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the NovoMix 50 dose may need to be adjusted. 
Fertility 
Animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human 
insulin regarding fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or 
operating machinery). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving or operating a 
machine. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning 
signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving or 
operating a machine should be considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions observed in patients using NovoMix are mainly due to the pharmacological effect of 
insulin aspart. 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia. The frequencies of 
hypoglycaemia vary with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control, please see 
Description of selected adverse reactions below. 
At the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies, oedema and injection site reactions 
(pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur. 
These reactions are usually of a transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be 
associated with acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy 
with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of 
diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of 
diabetic retinopathy.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions listed below are based on clinical trial data and classified according to MedDRA 
frequency and System Organ Class. Frequency categories are defined according to the following 
convention: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Anaphylactic reactions: 
The occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, 
sweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulties in breathing, palpitation and 
reduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life-threatening. 
Hypoglycaemia: 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too 
high in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or 
convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. 
The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale 
skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty 
in concentrating, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation.  
In clinical trials, the frequency of hypoglycaemia varied with patient population, dose regimens and 
level of glycaemic control. During clinical trials, the overall rates of hypoglycaemia did not differ 
between patients treated with insulin aspart compared to human insulin. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: 
Lipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the 
injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the 
given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of NovoMix 50 in children below 18 years of age have not been established. 
No data are available. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other special populations 
Based on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse 
reactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate 
any differences to the broader experience in the general population. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
A specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over 
sequential stages if too high doses relative to the patient’s requirement are administered: 
• 
• 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary 
products. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing 
products. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with 
glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with 
glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously, 
if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining 
consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in order to 
prevent a relapse.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, intermediate- 
or long-acting combined with fast-acting. ATC code: A10AD05. 
NovoMix 50 is a biphasic suspension of 50% soluble insulin aspart (rapid-acting human insulin 
analogue) and 50% protamine-crystallised insulin aspart (intermediate-acting human insulin analogue). 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin aspart is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following 
binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose 
output from the liver. 
NovoMix 50 is a biphasic insulin, which contains 50% soluble insulin aspart. This has a rapid onset of 
action, thus allowing it to be given closer to a meal (within zero to 10 minutes of the meal) when 
compared to soluble human insulin. The crystalline phase (50%) consists of protamine-crystallised 
insulin aspart, which has an activity profile similar to that of human NPH insulin. 
When NovoMix 50 is injected subcutaneously, the onset of action will occur within 10 to 20 minutes 
of injection. The maximum effect is exerted between 1 and 4 hours after injection. The duration of 
action is 14 to 24 hours (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Activity Profile for NovoMix 50 in Healthy Caucasian Subjects. 
Insulin aspart is equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption, distribution and elimination 
In insulin aspart, substitution of amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 reduces the 
tendency to form hexamers as observed with soluble human insulin. The insulin aspart in the soluble 
phase of NovoMix 50 comprises 50% of the total insulin; this is absorbed more rapidly from the 
subcutaneous layer than the soluble insulin component of biphasic human insulin. The remaining 50% 
is in crystalline form as protamine-crystallised insulin aspart; this has a prolonged absorption profile 
similar to human NPH insulin. 
In healthy volunteers, a mean maximum serum concentration of 445 ± 135 pmol/l was reached about 
60 minutes after a subcutaneous dose of 0.30 unit/kg body weight. In type 2 patients with diabetes, the 
maximum concentration was reached about 95 minutes after dosing. 
Special populations 
The pharmacokinetics of NovoMix 50 have not been investigated in paediatrics, elderly patients or in 
patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. 
In in vitro tests, including binding to insulin and IGF-1 receptor sites and effects on cell growth, 
insulin aspart behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate that 
the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin aspart is equivalent to human insulin.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What NovoMix 30 is and what it is used for 
NovoMix 30 is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with both a rapid-acting and an intermediate-acting 
effect, in the ratio 30/70. Modern insulin products are improved versions of human insulin. 
NovoMix 30 is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged 
10 years and above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not 
produce enough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. 
NovoMix 30 will start to lower your blood sugar 10–20 minutes after you inject it, the maximum 
effect occurs between 1 and 4 hours after the injection, and the effect lasts for up to 24 hours. 
In treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, NovoMix 30 may be used in combination with tablets for 
diabetes and/or with injectable antidiabetic products. 
2.  What you need to know before you use NovoMix 30 
Do not use NovoMix 30  
► 
►

► 
► 
► 
► 
If you are allergic to insulin aspart or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (see section 6, 
Contents of the pack and other information). 
If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see a) Summary of serious and very 
common side effects in section 4. 
In insulin infusion pumps. 
If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. 
If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5, How to store NovoMix 
30. 
If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. 
If after resuspension, clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the 
bottom or the wall of the cartridge. 
If any of these apply, do not use NovoMix 30. Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before using NovoMix 30 
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. 
► 
►  Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not 
use it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band 
at the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that 
the cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further 
instructions. 
►  Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
►  Needles and NovoMix 30 Penfill must not be shared. 
►  NovoMix 30 Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to 
your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Warnings and precautions 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
► 
► 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. 
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
hereof. 
► 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3, How to use NovoMix 30). Tell your 
doctor if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently 
injecting into these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell 
you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
• 
• 
• 
NovoMix 30 can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above.  
There is limited experience with NovoMix 30 in children aged 6–9 years.  
No data are available for NovoMix 30 in children below 6 years of age. 
Other medicines and NovoMix 30 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has 
to change. Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) 
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) 
Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) 
Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). 
• 
• 
• 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) 
Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation) 
Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) 
Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat 
asthma) 
Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced 
influence on the body’s metabolic processes) 
Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). 
• 
• 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Drinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 30 
► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
► 
► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. There is limited clinical experience with insulin aspart in 
pregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. 
Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the 
health of your baby. 
There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 30 during breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
► 
• 
• 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Important information about some of the ingredients in NovoMix 30 
NovoMix 30 contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoMix 30 is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How to use NovoMix 30 
Dose and when to take your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
NovoMix 30 is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of 
the injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoMix 30 can be given soon after a meal. 
See How and where to inject, below for information. 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. 
When NovoMix 30 is used in combination with tablets for diabetes and/or with injectable antidiabetic 
products your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor.  
Use in children and adolescents 
NovoMix 30 can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above when premixed insulin 
is preferred. Limited clinical data exists for children aged 6–9 years. No data are available for 
NovoMix 30 in children below 6 years of age. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How and where to inject 
NovoMix 30 is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Never inject your insulin directly into a 
vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). NovoMix 30 Penfill is only suitable for injecting 
under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another 
method. 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of 
your thighs or upper arms. The insulin will work more quickly if you inject around the waist. You 
should always measure your blood sugar regularly. 
►  Do not refill the cartridge. 
►  NovoMix 30 Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery 
► 
systems and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles.  
If you are treated with NovoMix 30 Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use 
two insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. 
►  Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged. 
Resuspension of NovoMix 30 
Always check if there is enough insulin left (at least 12 units) in the cartridge to allow even 
resuspension. If there is not enough insulin left, use a new one. See your pen manual for further 
instructions. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
►  Every time you use a new NovoMix 30 Penfill (before you put the cartridge into the insulin 
delivery system) 
Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. 
Roll the cartridge between your palms 10 times – it is important that the cartridge is kept 
horizontal (level with the ground) (see picture A).  
Move the cartridge up and down between positions a and b (see picture B) 10 times so that the 
glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other.  
Repeat the rolling and moving procedures (see pictures A and B) until the liquid does appear 
uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. Do not use the cartridge if the resuspended insulin does 
not look uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. 
Complete the other stages of injection without delay. 
For every following injection  
Move the delivery system with the cartridge inside up and down between a and b (see picture B) 
at least 10 times until the liquid appears uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. Do not use the 
cartridge if the resuspended insulin does not look uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. 
Complete the other stages of injection without delay.

How to inject NovoMix 30 
► 
Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse 
and as described in your pen manual. 
►  Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed 
until the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit 
possible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir. 
►  After each injection, be sure to remove and discard the needle and store NovoMix 30 without 
the needle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out, which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
If you take more insulin than you should  
If you take too much insulin, your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of 
serious and very common side effects in section 4.  
If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects 
from diabetes in section 4.  
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) 
Effects from diabetes in section 4. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
a) 
Summary of serious and very common side effects  
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 
10 people. 
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 30 in section 2). 
• 
Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon given by someone who 
knows how to use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you 
are conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
► 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. 
►  When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is 
► 
stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. 
If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an 
injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a 
doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. 
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink because you may choke. 
Serious allergic reactions to NovoMix 30 or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic 
reaction) is a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life-threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 
10,000 people. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
b) 
List of other side effects 
Uncommon side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 100 people. 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, see your doctor. 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary.  
Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally, this soon disappears. If not, contact your doctor. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. Ask 
your doctor about this. 
Rare side effects  
May affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may 
get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient.  
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
c) 
Effects from diabetes 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin. 
Forget to take your insulin or stop taking insulin. 
Repeatedly take less insulin than you need. 
Get an infection and/or a fever. 
Eat more than usual. 
Exercise less than usual. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar: 
► 
► 
If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you 
can, then seek medical advice immediately. 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What NovoMix 30 is and what it is used for 
NovoMix 30 is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with both a rapid-acting and an intermediate-acting 
effect, in the ratio 30/70. Modern insulin products are improved versions of human insulin.  
NovoMix 30 is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged 
10 years and above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not 
produce enough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar.  
NovoMix 30 will start to lower your blood sugar 10–20 minutes after you inject it, the maximum 
effect occurs between 1 and 4 hours after the injection, and the effect lasts for up to 24 hours.  
In treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, NovoMix 30 may be used in combination with tablets for 
diabetes and/or with injectable antidiabetic products.

Before using NovoMix 30 
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. 
► 
►  Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
►  Needles and NovoMix 30 FlexPen must not be shared. 
►  NovoMix 30 FlexPen is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you 
need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Warnings and precautions 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
► 
► 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. 
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
hereof. 
► 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3, How to use NovoMix 30). Tell your 
doctor if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently 
injecting into these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell 
you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
• 
• 
• 
NovoMix 30 can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above.  
There is limited experience with NovoMix 30 in children aged 6–9 years. 
No data are available for NovoMix 30 in children below 6 years of age. 
Other medicines and NovoMix 30 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has 
to change. Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) 
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) 
Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) 
Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). 
• 
• 
• 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take:

Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Drinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 30 
► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
► 
► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. There is limited clinical experience with insulin aspart in 
pregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. 
Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the 
health of your baby. 
There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 30 during breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
► 
• 
• 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Important information about some of the ingredients in NovoMix 30 
NovoMix 30 contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoMix 30 is essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

3. 
How to use NovoMix 30 
Dose and when to take your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
NovoMix 30 is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of 
the injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoMix 30 can be given soon after a meal. 
See How and where to inject, below for information.  
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. 
When NovoMix 30 is used in combination with tablets for diabetes and/or with injectable antidiabetic 
products your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor.  
Use in children and adolescents 
NovoMix 30 can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above when premixed insulin 
is preferred. Limited clinical data exists for children aged 6–9 years. No data are available for 
NovoMix 30 in children below 6 years of age. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How and where to inject 
NovoMix 30 is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Never inject your insulin directly into a 
vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). NovoMix 30 FlexPen is only suitable for injecting 
under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of 
your thighs or upper arms. The insulin will work more quickly if you inject around the waist. You 
should always measure your blood sugar regularly. 
How to handle NovoMix 30 FlexPen 
NovoMix 30 FlexPen is a pre-filled, colour-coded, disposable pen containing a mixture of rapid-acting 
and intermediate-acting insulin aspart in the ratio 30/70. 
Read carefully the instructions for use included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen as 
described in the Instructions for use. 
Always ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. 
If you take more insulin than you should 
If you take too much insulin, your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of 
serious and very common side effects in section 4. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) 
Effects from diabetes in section 4.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

Instruction on how to use NovoMix 30 suspension for injection in FlexPen.  
Read the following instructions carefully before using your FlexPen. If you do not follow the 
instructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low 
blood sugar level. 
Your FlexPen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose insulin pen.  
►  You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in increments of 1 unit.  
► 
FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles up to a length 
of 8 mm.  
►  Always carry a spare insulin delivery device in case your FlexPen is lost or damaged.

Caring for your pen 
►  Your FlexPen must be handled with care. If it is dropped, damaged or crushed, there is a risk of 
insulin leakage. This may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to too high or too low blood 
sugar level.  
►  You can clean the exterior of your FlexPen by wiping it with a medicinal swab. Do not soak, 
wash or lubricate it as it may damage the pen.  
►  Do not refill your FlexPen. 
Resuspending your insulin 
A 
Check the name and coloured label of your pen to make sure that it contains the correct type of 
insulin. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take the wrong 
type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. 
Every time you use a new pen 
Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. 
Pull off the pen cap.  
  A 
B 
Before your first injection with a new FlexPen, you must resuspend the insulin: 
Roll the pen between your palms 10 times – it is important that the pen is kept horizontal (level with 
the ground).  
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  B 
C 
Then move the pen up and down 10 times between the two positions as shown, so the glass ball 
moves from one end of the cartridge to the other.  
Repeat rolling and moving the pen until the liquid does appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous.  
For every following injection  
Move the pen up and down between the two positions at least 10 times until the liquid does appear 
uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. 
►  Always make sure that you have resuspended the insulin prior to each injection. This reduces 
the risk of too high or too low blood sugar level. After you have resuspended the insulin, 
complete all the following steps of injection without delay. 
  C 
Always check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow resuspension. If 
there are less than 12 units left, use a new FlexPen. 12 units are marked on the residual scale. 
See the big picture on top of this instruction. 
Do not use the pen if the resuspended insulin does not look uniformly white, cloudy and 
aqueous. 
Attaching a needle 
D 
Take a new needle and tear off the paper tab. 
Screw the needle straight and tightly onto your FlexPen. 
  D 
E 
Pull off the big outer needle cap and keep it for later.  
  E 
F 
Pull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the needle. 
  F 
Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, 
leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing.  
Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. 
Checking the insulin flow 
Prior to each injection, small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To 
avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: 
G 
Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. 
  G 
2 units 
selected 
H 
Hold your FlexPen with the needle pointing upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a 
few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. 
  H 
I 
Keeping the needle upwards, press the push-button all the way in. The dose selector returns to 0. 
A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no 
more than 6 times. 
If a drop of insulin still does not appear, the pen is defective, and you must use a new one. 
  I 
Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure that 
the insulin flows. If no drop appears you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose 
selector may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little 
insulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. 
Selecting your dose 
Check that the dose selector is set at 0. 
J 
Turn the dose selector to select the number of units you need to inject. 
The dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the 
correct dose lines up with the pointer. When turning the dose selector, be careful not to push the push-
button as insulin will come out. 
You cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge. 
  J 
5 units 
selected 
24 units 
selected 
Always use the dose selector and the pointer to see how many units you have selected before 
injecting the insulin. 
Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may 
get too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows approximately how much 
insulin is left in your pen. 
Making the injection 
Insert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique shown by your doctor or nurse. 
K 
Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until 0 lines up with the pointer. Be careful 
only to push the push-button when injecting. 
Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin. 
  K 
L 
►  Keep the push-button fully depressed and let the needle remain under the skin for at least 
6 seconds. This will make sure you get the full dose. 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
►  Withdraw the needle from the skin, then release the pressure on the push-button. 
►  Always make sure that the dose selector returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops 
before it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood 
sugar level. 
  L 
M 
Lead the needle into the big outer needle cap without touching it. When the needle is covered, 
carefully push the big outer needle cap completely on and then unscrew the needle.  
Dispose of it carefully and put the pen cap back on your FlexPen. 
  M 
Always remove the needle after each injection and store your FlexPen without the needle 
attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles 
and inaccurate dosing. 
Further important information 
Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles to reduce the risk of needle sticks 
and cross-infection. 
Dispose of the used FlexPen carefully without the needle attached. 
Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. 
Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. 
Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What NovoMix 50 is and what it is used for  
NovoMix 50 is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with both a rapid-acting and an intermediate-acting 
effect, in the ratio 50/50. Modern insulin products are improved versions of human insulin. 
NovoMix 50 is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). 
Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your 
blood sugar. NovoMix 50 may be used in combination with metformin.  
NovoMix 50 will start to lower your blood sugar 10–20 minutes after you inject it, the maximum 
effect occurs between 1 and 4 hours after the injection, and the effect lasts for up to 14–24 hours. 
2.  What you need to know before you use NovoMix 50

Before using NovoMix 50 
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. 
► 
►  Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not 
use it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band 
at the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that 
the cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further 
instructions. 
►  Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
►  Needles and NovoMix 50 Penfill must not be shared. 
►  NovoMix 50 Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to 
your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Warnings and precautions 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
► 
► 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. 
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
hereof. 
► 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3, How to use NovoMix 50). Tell your 
doctor if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently 
injecting into these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell 
you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Other medicines and NovoMix 50 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has 
to change. Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. 
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes

Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Drinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 50 
► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
► 
► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. There is limited clinical experience with insulin aspart in 
pregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. 
Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the 
health of your baby. 
There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 50 during breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
► 
• 
• 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Important information about some of the ingredients in NovoMix 50 
NovoMix 50 contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoMix 50 is essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

3. 
How to use NovoMix 50 
Dose and when to take your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
NovoMix 50 is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of 
the injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoMix 50 can be given soon after a meal. 
See How and where to inject, below for information. 
When NovoMix 50 is used in combination with metformin the dose should be adjusted. 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
No clinical studies with NovoMix 50 have been carried out in children and adolescents under the age 
of 18 years. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How and where to inject 
NovoMix 50 is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Never inject your insulin directly into a 
vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). NovoMix 50 Penfill is only suitable for injecting 
under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another 
method. 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of 
your thighs or upper arms. The insulin will work more quickly if you inject around the waist. You 
should always measure your blood sugar regularly. 
►  Do not refill the cartridge. 
►  NovoMix 50 Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery 
► 
systems and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles. 
If you are treated with NovoMix 50 Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use 
two insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. 
►  Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged. 
Resuspension of NovoMix 50 
Always check if there is enough insulin left (at least 12 units) in the cartridge to allow even 
resuspension. If there is not enough insulin left, use a new one. See your pen manual for further 
instructions. 
► 
• 
• 
Every time you use a new NovoMix 50 Penfill (before you put the cartridge into the insulin 
delivery system) 
Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. 
Roll the cartridge between your palms 10 times – it is important that the cartridge is kept 
horizontal (level with the ground) (see picture A).  
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
► 
• 
• 
• 
Move the cartridge up and down between positions a and b (see picture B) 10 times so that the 
glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other.  
Repeat the rolling and moving procedures (see pictures A and B) until the liquid does appear 
uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. Do not use the cartridge if the resuspended insulin does 
not look uniformly white and cloudy. 
Complete the other stages of injection without delay. 
For every following injection  
Move the delivery system with the cartridge inside up and down between a and b (see picture B) 
at least 10 times until the liquid appears uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. Do not use the 
cartridge if the resuspended insulin does not look uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. 
If the moving procedure alone is not enough to give a uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous 
liquid, repeat the rolling and moving procedures described above until the liquid appears 
uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous.  
Complete the other stages of injection without delay. 
Pict ure A 
How to inject NovoMix 50 
► 
Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse 
and as described in your pen manual. 
►  Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed 
until the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit 
possible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir. 
►  After each injection, be sure to remove and discard the needle and store NovoMix 50 without 
the needle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out, which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
If you take more insulin than you should  
If you take too much insulin, your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of 
serious and very common side effects in section 4. 
If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) 
Effects from diabetes in section 4. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
a) 
Summary of serious and very common side effects  
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 
10 people. 
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 50 in section 2). 
• 
Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon given by someone who 
knows how to use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you 
are conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
► 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. 
►  When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is 
► 
stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. 
If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an 
injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a 
doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. 
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink because you may choke. 
Serious allergic reactions to NovoMix 50 or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic 
reaction) is a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life-threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 
10,000 people. 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
b) 
List of other side effects 
Uncommon side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 100 people. 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, see your doctor. 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally, this soon disappears. If not, contact your doctor. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. Ask 
your doctor about this. 
Rare side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may 
get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin. 
Forget to take your insulin or stop taking insulin. 
Repeatedly take less insulin than you need. 
Get an infection and/or a fever. 
Eat more than usual. 
Exercise less than usual. 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar: 
► 
► 
If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you 
can, then seek medical advice immediately. 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What NovoMix 50 is and what it is used for 
NovoMix 50 is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with both a rapid-acting and an intermediate-acting 
effect, in the ratio 50/50. Modern insulin products are improved versions of human insulin. 
NovoMix 50 is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). 
Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your 
blood sugar. NovoMix 50 may be used in combination with metformin. 
NovoMix 50 will start to lower your blood sugar 10–20 minutes after you inject it, the maximum 
effect occurs between 1 and 4 hours after the injection, and the effect lasts for up to 14–24 hours.

Before using NovoMix 50 
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. 
► 
►  Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
►  Needles and NovoMix 50 FlexPen must not be shared. 
►  NovoMix 50 FlexPen is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you 
need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Warnings and precautions 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
► 
► 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. 
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
hereof. 
► 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3, How to use NovoMix 50). Tell your 
doctor if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently 
injecting into these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell 
you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Other medicines and NovoMix 50 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has 
to change. Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. 
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) 
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) 
Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) 
Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). 
• 
• 
• 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) 
Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation) 
Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) 
Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat 
asthma) 
Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced 
influence on the body’s metabolic processes) 
Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). 
• 
• 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).  
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Drinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 50 
► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
► 
► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. There is limited clinical experience with insulin aspart in 
pregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. 
Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the 
health of your baby.  
There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 50 during breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
► 
• 
• 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Important information about some of the ingredients in NovoMix 50 
NovoMix 50 contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoMix 50 is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use NovoMix 50 
Dose and when to take your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
NovoMix 50 is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of 
the injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoMix 50 can be given soon after a meal. 
See How and where to inject, below for information.  
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When NovoMix 50 is used in combination with metformin the dose should be adjusted. 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
No clinical studies with NovoMix 50 have been carried out in children and adolescents under the age 
of 18 years. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How and where to inject 
NovoMix 50 is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Never inject your insulin directly into a 
vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). NovoMix 50 FlexPen is only suitable for injecting 
under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of 
your thighs or upper arms. The insulin will work more quickly if you inject around the waist. You 
should always measure your blood sugar regularly. 
How to handle NovoMix 50 FlexPen 
NovoMix 50 FlexPen is a pre-filled, colour-coded, disposable pen containing a mixture of rapid-acting 
and intermediate-acting insulin aspart in the ratio 50/50. 
Read carefully the instructions for use included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen as 
described in the Instructions for use. 
Always ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. 
If you take more insulin than you should  
If you take too much insulin, your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of 
serious and very common side effects in section 4. 
If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) 
Effects from diabetes in section 4. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
a) 
Summary of serious and very common side effects  
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 
10 people. 
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 50 in section 2). 
• 
Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon given by someone who 
knows how to use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you 
are conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
► 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. 
►  When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is 
► 
stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. 
If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an 
injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a 
doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. 
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink because you may choke. 
Serious allergic reactions to NovoMix 50 or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic 
reaction) is a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life-threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 
10,000 people. 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.

b) 
List of other side effects 
Uncommon side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 100 people. 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, see your doctor. 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally, this soon disappears. If not, contact your doctor. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. Ask 
your doctor about this. 
Rare side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may 
get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
c) 
Effects from diabetes 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin. 
Forget to take your insulin or stop taking insulin. 
Repeatedly take less insulin than you need. 
Get an infection and/or a fever. 
Eat more than usual. 
Exercise less than usual. 
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar: 
► 
► 
If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you 
can, then seek medical advice immediately. 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

Instruction on how to use NovoMix 50 suspension for injection in FlexPen. 
Read the following instructions carefully before using your FlexPen. If you do not follow the 
instructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low 
blood sugar level. 
Your FlexPen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose insulin pen.  
►  You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in increments of 1 unit.  
► 
FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles up to a length 
of 8 mm. 
►  Always carry a spare insulin delivery device in case your FlexPen is lost or damaged.

Caring for your pen 
►  Your FlexPen must be handled with care. If it is dropped, damaged or crushed, there is a risk of 
insulin leakage. This may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to too high or too low blood 
sugar level. 
►  You can clean the exterior of your FlexPen by wiping it with a medicinal swab. Do not soak, 
wash or lubricate it as it may damage the pen.  
►  Do not refill your FlexPen. 
Resuspending your insulin 
A 
Check the name and coloured label of your pen to make sure that it contains the correct type of 
insulin. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take the wrong 
type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. 
Every time you use a new pen 
Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. 
Pull off the pen cap.  
  A 
B 
Before your first injection with a new FlexPen, you must resuspend the insulin: 
Roll the pen between your palms 10 times – it is important that the pen is kept horizontal (level with 
the ground).  
83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  B 
C 
Then move the pen up and down 10 times between the two positions as shown, so the glass ball 
moves from one end of the cartridge to the other.  
Repeat rolling and moving the pen until the liquid does appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous.  
For every following injection  
Move the pen up and down between the two positions at least 10 times until the liquid does appear 
uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. If the moving procedure alone is not enough to give a uniformly 
white, cloudy and aqueous liquid, repeat the rolling and moving procedures (see B and C) until the 
liquid does appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. 
►  Always make sure that you have resuspended the insulin prior to each injection. This reduces 
the risk of too high or too low blood sugar level. After you have resuspended the insulin, 
complete all the following steps of injection without delay. 
  C 
Always check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow resuspension. If 
there are less than 12 units left, use a new FlexPen. 12 units are marked on the residual scale. 
See the big picture on top of this instruction. 
Do not use the pen if the resuspended insulin does not look uniformly white, cloudy and 
aqueous. 
Attaching a needle 
D 
Take a new needle and tear off the paper tab.  
Screw the needle straight and tightly onto your FlexPen. 
  D 
E 
Pull off the big outer needle cap and keep it for later.  
  E 
84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
F 
Pull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. 
Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the needle. 
  F 
Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, 
leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing.  
Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. 
Checking the insulin flow 
Prior to each injection, small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To 
avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: 
G 
Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. 
  G 
2 units 
selected 
H 
Hold your FlexPen with the needle pointing upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a 
few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. 
  H 
I 
Keeping the needle upwards, press the push-button all the way in. The dose selector returns to 0. 
A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no 
more than 6 times. 
If a drop of insulin still does not appear, the pen is defective, and you must use a new one. 
  I 
85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure that 
the insulin flows. If no drop appears you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose 
selector may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. 
Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little 
insulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. 
Selecting your dose 
Check that the dose selector is set at 0.

Turn the dose selector to select the number of units you need to inject. 
The dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the 
correct dose lines up with the pointer. When turning the dose selector, be careful not to push the push-
button as insulin will come out. 
You cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge.

Always use the dose selector and the pointer to see how many units you have selected before 
injecting the insulin. 
Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may 
get too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows approximately how much 
insulin is left in your pen. 
Making the injection 
Insert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique shown by your doctor or nurse. 
K 
Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until 0 lines up with the pointer. Be careful 
only to push the push-button when injecting. 
Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin.

L 
►  Keep the push-button fully depressed and let the needle remain under the skin for at least 
6 seconds. This will make sure you get the full dose.  
►  Withdraw the needle from the skin, then release the pressure on the push-button. 
►  Always make sure that the dose selector returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops 
before it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood 
sugar level. 
  L 
M 
Lead the needle into the big outer needle cap without touching it. When the needle is covered, 
carefully push the big outer needle cap completely on and then unscrew the needle.  
Dispose of it carefully and put the pen cap back on your FlexPen. 
  M 
Always remove the needle after each injection and store your FlexPen without the needle 
attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles 
and inaccurate dosing. 
Further important information 
Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles to reduce the risk of needle sticks 
and cross-infection. 
Dispose of the used FlexPen carefully without the needle attached. 
Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. 
Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. 
Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children.

1.  Introduction
On 16 February 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for edoxaban tosilate (Lixiana  
and its duplicate Roteas), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as 
amended.
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.
2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Information on the development program
Edoxaban (as tosylate) is an orally active, selective, direct, and reversible inhibitor of activated 
coagulation factor X (FXa) that was developed as an anticoagulant agent. 
The Edoxaban Marketing Authorisation (Lixiana) was granted by the European Commission (EC) on 
19 Jun 2015. In addition, Roteas was approved on 19 Apr 2017 as informed consent approval to 
Lixiana. 
Edoxaban is currently approved in the EU as film-coated tablets for oral use for the following 
indications: 

Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 
(NVAF) with 1 or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, 
diabetes mellitus, prior stroke, or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). 

Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and prevention of 
recurrent DVT and PE in adults. 
The recommended dose in adults with NVAF and venous thromboembolism (DVT and PE) is 60 mg of 
edoxaban once daily. A dose recommendation of 30 mg edoxaban once daily is addressed to adult 
patients with one or more of the following clinical factors: moderate or severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance [CrCl] 15 – 50 mL/min), low body weight (≤60 kg), and concomitant treatment 
with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors (ciclosporin, dronedarone, erythromycin, ketoconazole). Edoxaban 
15 mg is not indicated as monotherapy, as it may result in decreased efficacy. It is only indicated in 
the process of switching from edoxaban 30 mg to Vitamin K antagonist (VKA), together with an 
appropriate VKA dose.
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0028/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). According to the last PIP 
modification (EMEA-000788-PIP02-11-M11), the agreed PIP for edoxaban as film-coated tablet and 
age-appropriate oral dosage form for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism and the prevention 
and treatment of venous thromboembolism conditions, includes the following 3 clinical studies: 

For the acute treatment and secondary prevention of symptomatic recurrent venous thrombotic 
events (VTE) in paediatric patients at risk (paediatric population with confirmed VTE) 
- Supportive Phase 1 Study DU176b-A-U157 (hereafter referred to as Study U157; Study 13 in 
the PIP). Completed.
- Pivotal Phase 3 Study DU176b-D-U312 (Hokusai VTE Pediatric Study, hereafter referred to as 
Study U312; Study 11 in the PIP). Ongoing.

In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH 
hereby submits to the EMA a final study report for the study number DU176b-A-U157, which is part of 
the PIP EMEA-000788-PIP02-11-M11 (PIP Study 13). In addition, the results of the population-based 
pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model to predict the dose in the single-dose Study U157 are included in 
Appendix 16.1.13 of the clinical study report. This modelling study refers to PIP Study 14.
The MAH stated that the study DU176b-A-U157 “A Phase 1, Open-label, Single-dose, Non-randomized 
Study to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Edoxaban in Pediatric Patients” is a 
stand alone study. As such, a line listing is not provided.
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study
Edoxaban (as tosilate) has been approved in the European Union for oral administration as film-coated 
tablets containing 15 mg, 30 mg or 60 mg of edoxaban. As stated in Section. 4.2. Method of 
administration of the approved SmPC: for patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, edoxaban 
tablets may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree and immediately administered orally (see 
Section 5.2). Alternatively, edoxaban tablets may be crushed and suspended in a small amount of 
water and immediately delivered through a gastric tube after which it should be flushed with water 
(see Section 5.2). Crushed edoxaban tablets are stable in water and apple puree for up to 4 hours.
In accordance with the CSR, the pharmaceutical formulations used in Study U157 were as follows: 

Edoxaban 15 mg or 30 mg oral tablets: for subjects in the 12 to <18 years age cohort.

2.3.  Clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
The MAH submitted a final report for Study DU176b-A-U157: “A Phase 1, Open-label, Single-dose, 
Non-randomized Study to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Edoxaban in Pediatric 
Patients”.
2.3.2.  Clinical study
Clinical study number DU176b-A-U157 (U157): “A Phase 1, Open-label, 
Single-dose, Non-randomized Study to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics and 
Pharmacodynamics of Edoxaban in Pediatric Patients”
Description
This was a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, multiple-center study to evaluate PK and PD (a dose-
finding goal) and safety of edoxaban in paediatric patients (from 38 weeks gestational age to 
<18 years) with ongoing risk of thromboembolic events. Study U157 was a single-dose study with a 
sequential enrolment (from older to younger) and with 2 tested doses (a “low” dose to achieve 
exposures comparable to a 30 mg adult dose and a “high” dose to achieve exposures comparable to a 
60 mg adult dose). The study included 5 paediatric age cohorts (12 to <18 years (yrs), 6 to <12 yrs, 
2 to <6 yrs, 6 months (mo) to <2 yrs and 0 to <6 mo) with evaluation of 2 different doses within each 
age cohort (low and high dose). The pharmaceutical formulations used in Study U157 were edoxaban 
15 mg or 30 mg oral tablets (for subjects in the 12 to <18 years age cohort) and edoxaban granules 
for oral suspension (60 mg reconstituted with water to provide a 6 mg/mL suspension for oral 
administration; for subjects <12 years).
Study duration was approximately 4 weeks for each patient, which included a screening period (within 
21 days of dosing), a treatment period, and a follow-up visit conducted within 10 days after dosing. A 
patient was considered to have completed the study if he/she provided the last scheduled PK sample.
Methods
Study participants
Inclusion criteria 
Male and female paediatric patients who might require or currently were on anticoagulant therapy were 
eligible for enrolment, including: 

Patients who had a recently acquired or Investigator determined ongoing risk of thromboembolic 
events (eg, patients with thrombophilia, congenital heart disease, presence of a central venous 
catheter, and prior VTE).

dose. 
At least 24 hours from last dose of QD LMWH, with a restart of LMWH 24 hours after edoxaban 
dose. 


Patients with cardiac conditions who may have required anticoagulant therapy. 
Patients with sickle cell disease who may have required anticoagulant therapy. 
For any condition, anticoagulant treatment interruption or discontinuation did not take place if the 
patient was at increased risk and interruption or discontinuation were appropriate as per standard-of-
care practices. 
Patients had to satisfy all of the following criteria to be included in the study. Any temporal changes in 
the following criteria that may have prohibited patient consideration, but should have normalized for 
future eligibility, were reassessed for the patient’s future participation in the study:

applicable) and ICFs (signed by parent/legal guardian) prior to participating in the study. 
2. Male or female patients 38 weeks gestation to 18 years of age on the day of dosing. 
3. Patients 2 to <18 years of age had to have a body mass index (BMI) between the 5th and 95th 
percentile based on the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Growth Charts (the 
maximum number of patients in each dose group that had a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile 
should have not been more than 2 patients). Patients <2 years of age had to have a body weight 
between the 5th and 90th percentile based on the 2000 CDC Growth Charts. 
4. Female patients who have had menarche had to test negative for pregnancy, as per local practice, 
at screening and check-in. 
5. Female patients who have had menarche and were sexually active, had to agree to use an effective 
contraception method, per local practice, for at least 30 days prior to edoxaban dose.

7. Patients had to agree to abstain from the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as 
ibuprofen) and antiplatelet (except for low dose aspirin) from 14 days prior to edoxaban dose until 
after the last PK sample was collected. Patients on low dose aspirin treatment (1 to 5 mg/kg/day, 
maximum of 100 mg/day) were permitted to participate in the study per the Investigator’s judgment 
that this did not place the patients at risk. Low dose aspirin on Day 1 should have been withheld until 
4 hours post edoxaban dose. 
8. Other than signs and symptoms characteristic to their disease state, patients were to be in good 
health as determined by the absence of clinically significant deviations from normal, with respect to 
medical and surgical history, physical examination, vital signs, and laboratory reports, as deemed by 
the Investigator prior to enrolment. 
Exclusion Criteria 
Patients who met any of the following criteria were disqualified from entering the study. Any temporal 
changes in the following criteria that may have prohibited patient consideration, but should have 
normalized for future eligibility, were reassessed for the patient’s future participation in the study:

patients were on prescription drug(s). The window to potentially hold and/or resume the prescription 
drug needed to be determined by DSI based on the information of the prescription drug. 
17. Patients who had received a transfusion or any blood products within 30 days prior to the first 
dose. 
18. Patients with any condition that, as judged by the Investigator, would have placed the patient at 
increased risk of harm if he/she participated in the study or would have interfered with the conduct of 
the study or the interpretation of the data. 
19. Patients with a history of thrombosis who were diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and 
were triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I 
antibodies). 
Treatments
Subjects received a single dose of edoxaban only. The treatment period consisted of predose 
procedures occurring on Day -1 or 1, dosing on Day 1, and post dose procedures occurring post dose 
on Days 1 and 2 (all cohorts) and Day 3 (all patients enrolled prior to version 5.0 of the Protocol could 
have had Day 3 PK samples obtained). 
Edoxaban dosing regimens for the different age groups were selected to achieve exposures comparable 
to adult doses of 60 mg (recommended dose) and 30 mg (dose reduction based on clinical factors), 
referred to as a high dose and a low dose regimen. The doses given to each age cohort and dose group 
were adjusted based on emerging data. The doses (mg/kg) for patients younger than 6 years were 
based on patients’ body weight, as presented in Table 2.

Objectives
Primary objective
The primary objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) of edoxaban in 
paediatric patients following single-dose oral administration. 
PK analysis objectives were:

To establish a preliminary edoxaban population PK (PopPK) model in paediatric patients aged 0 to 
<18 years of age.

To conduct PK simulations and propose dose regimens for each subsequent dose cohort and also 
for the same age cohort in the ongoing Phase 3 Study DU176b-A-U312. 
Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives of this study were as follows: 

To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of edoxaban in paediatric patients following single-
dose oral administration. 

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single-dose oral administration of edoxaban in paediatric 
patients. 

To assess metabolite exposure (D21-2393, D21-3231, D21-1402, and D21-2135) in paediatric 
patients. 

To evaluate the palatability (bitterness, sweetness, and overall taste or aroma) of the liquid oral 
suspension of edoxaban. 
Exploratory Objectives
No exploratory objectives were planned for this study. 
Study Hypothesis
The study was not intended to test a hypothesis but rather to generate information that would allow 
dose selection (comparable to the exposure of efficacious doses in adults) for subsequent clinical 
efficacy/safety Phase 3 studies in paediatrics.

Outcomes/endpoints

Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Endpoints  
Drug concentrations and other pharmacokinetic endpoints
The PK endpoints included PopPK model-estimated PK parameters such as apparent systemic clearance 
(CL/F; also referred to as clearance from central compartment [CL]), apparent volume of distribution 
(V/F; also referred to as central compartment volume [V1]), and area under the concentration-time 
curve (AUC). 
The current paediatric PopPK analysis used a Bayesian approach (software stan® with R package 
Torsten), incorporating the information from the PopPK model previously developed to describe 
edoxaban PK in adult subjects (Niebecker et al., 2015). Initially the adult PopPK model was modified to 
derive the PK model for paediatric subjects age 2– <18 years. Subsequently, the model was further 
modified to fit the data from younger subjects. Using Stan, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
sampling of the posterior distribution of the PopPK model parameters was implemented.

Model development for paediatric population
This preliminary PopPK analysis includes available PK data from the single-dose paediatric study 
DU176b-A-U157 and the ongoing multiple-dose paediatric study DU176b-A-U312 as of 03 Sep 2021. A 
final PopPK analysis will be conducted when both studies are completed. Bayesian estimation was 
conducted after each age cohort with available cumulative data from both paediatric studies and the 
dose projection was performed for the subsequent cohort in study DU176b-A-U157. Edoxaban 
exposure in the paediatric population was estimated using the individual PK parameters. The specific 
modeling/simulation procedure is briefly listed below:

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
EMA/571080/2022 
Page 12/27
• Step 1: Edoxaban adult PopPK model was modified by replacing the separate nonrenal and 
renal-clearance components with an overall clearance (CL) parameter to derive PK model for 
paediatrics (Figure 2). Differences in size was accounted for by allometry.
Figure 2: Transition from adult PK model (A) to the paediatric PK model (B)
Source: Appendix 16.1.13
The paediatric PopPK model was further modified to take into account ontogeny related to 
clearance mechanisms by incorporating maturation function that adjusts clearance by 
postmenstrual age (PMA) in weeks.
• Step 2: Edoxaban paediatric data from Studies DU176b-A-U157 and DU176b-A-U312 was 
fitted with the predefined model in Step 1 using a Bayesian approach.
• Step 3: The individual exposure (median and 90% CrI) was estimated using the post hoc 
parameter estimates. The exposures of the low and high dose group were compared with the 
exposure in the adult VTE subjects receiving 30 mg QD and 60 mg QD, respectively.
Appropriateness of the proposed paediatric dose
The model was also used to estimate individual paediatric subject exposures (area under the 
concentration time curve (AUC) from time 0 extrapolated to infinity, AUCinf) and compared to adult 
references (steady state AUC over the dosing interval) of 30 mg or 60 mg, depending on the dosage 
group, to assess whether the individual exposures are within the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the 
median target adult exposure. The appropriateness of the dose in an age cohort is assessed by 
comparing the median exposure in that dose group with the median adult exposure. If the median 
paediatric exposure was within the 0.5 to 1.5-fold of the adult VTE exposure at 60 mg QD dose, the 
paediatric dose was considered appropriate.
Pharmacodynamic Endpoints 
The PD endpoints included observed, change from Baseline, and percent change from Baseline 
prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and anti-FXa.

Safety Endpoints 
Safety assessments included AEs; SAEs, TEAEs, and treatment-emergent SAEs (TESAEs); physical 
examination findings; vital signs; and standard haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis 
laboratory tests. 
Note: Urinalysis was performed with plastic bags with a sticky strip for neonates and infants with 
diapers. 

Other Endpoints: Formulation Palatability 
Patients receiving the edoxaban granules for oral suspension formulation who were developmentally 
capable of providing an accurate response were asked to rate several aspects of palatability (including 
bitterness, sweetness, overall taste, and aroma) using a 100-millimeter visual analog scale (VAS). The 
VAS questionnaire was provided to the sites by Medpace. 
Patients who were old enough scored the VAS themselves. For younger children, the parents provided 
this information, if possible. For the youngest children, there was free text input available to provide 
information on whether the patient spat it out or may not have liked the flavour, etc. 
VAS and text responses were measured and/or recorded on the CRF. 
Sample size
A total of 60 patients were to be enrolled, 12 evaluable patients per age cohort. Based on the 
assumptions of the inter-patient CV of 10.8% and 29.3% for CL/F and V/F, respectively, and the ratio 
of a younger age cohort to the reference age cohort (12 to <18 years) to be 1, a sample size of 12 
evaluable patients per age cohort was to provide >95% power to assess that the 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for cohort to reference cohort ratio is contained within the 60% to 140% range for CL/F. 
This sample size was to provide about 76% power for the assessment of V/F. If emerging data 
suggested that the variability was much larger than anticipated, sample size could have been 
increased. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking)
This was a non-randomized study. Blinding/masking methods were not applicable. 
Statistical Methods
This was a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, non-randomized, multiple-center study to evaluate PK and 
PD of edoxaban in paediatric patients. The analyses for this study were considered descriptive and 
exploratory. No visit windows were used for analyses. 
In general, all data were summarized by age cohort and dose group, and all evaluable data were 
included in the analyses. For qualitative variables, the population size (N for sample size and n for 
available data) and the percentage/incidence (of available data) for each class of the variable are 
presented. Quantitative variables were summarized using descriptive statistics, including the 
population size (N for sample size and n for available data), mean, standard deviation (SD), median,

minimum, and maximum values. Coefficient of variation (CV), geometric mean, and geometric CV% 
were included for PK parameters. 
Model-based approaches used for PK analysis are described in subsection Drug Concentrations and 
Other Pharmacokinetic Endpoints.
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring 
Emerging PK concentration-time data from completing patients were analyzed using model-based 
approaches on an ongoing basis and used to predict and optimize the doses required to obtain targeted 
exposures in upcoming age cohorts and dose groups. 
Examination of Subgroups 
The study included 5 paediatric age cohorts with evaluation of 2 different doses within each age cohort 
(low and high dose). In general, all data were summarized by age cohort and dose group, and all 
evaluable data were included in the analyses. 
Analysis Sets

Results
Participant flow
A total of 66 patients was enrolled in the study, which were approximately evenly distributed among all 
age cohorts. In each age cohort, patients were approximately evenly distributed between both dosing 
groups. The dosing groups included 6 to 8 patients per group. All patients completed the last study 
visit.

Recruitment
A total of 66 patients, out of 100 patients screened, were enrolled during the study period (Date first 
patient enrolled: 05 November 2014; Date last patient completed: 16 September 2021).
This study was conducted at 32 clinical sites in the United States, Canada, France, India, Italy, Jordan, 
Lebanon, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. 
Baseline data
For all age cohorts, the mean age of patients was similar in both dosing groups (approximately 15.9 
years in the low dose and 15.3 years in the high dose groups for Cohorts 1a/1b, approximately 9.6 
years in the low dose and 9.5 years in the high dose groups for Cohorts 2a/2b, approximately 4.3 
years in both the low and high dose groups for Cohorts 3a/3b, approximately 1.2 years in the low dose 
and 1.0 year in the high dose groups for Cohorts 4a/4b, and 0.17 years in the low dose and 0.25 years 
in the high dose groups for Cohorts 5a/5b). 
Given the small number of patients in each cohort, there was a balanced number of male and female 
patients in each dose group. In most cohorts and dose groups, the majority of patients were White, 
with the exception of the high dose treatment group of Cohort 3 (3b; half of the patients were White), 
low dose group of Cohort 4 (4a; approximately 43% of the patients were Asian), and both low and 
high dose groups of Cohort 5 (5a/5b; two-thirds of the patients in the low dose group [5a] and half of

the patients in the high dose group [5b] were Asian). In all cohorts, the majority or all of the patients 
were not Hispanic or Latino. 
For all age cohorts, the median height, weight, and BMI at Baseline were similar in both dosing groups. 
The median BMI was approximately 21 kg/m2 in both low dose and high dose group for Cohorts 1a/1b, 
approximately 18 kg/m2 in the low dose group and 17 kg/m2 in the high dose group for Cohorts 
2a/2b, approximately 15 kg/m2 in the low dose group and 16 kg/m2 in the high dose group for 
Cohorts 3a/3b, approximately 17 kg/m2 in both low dose and high dose groups for Cohorts 4a/4b, and 
approximately 14 kg/m2 in the low dose group and 15 kg/m2 in the high dose group for Cohorts 
5a/5b. 
Number analysed
The Safety Analysis Set included 66 subjects. All 66 (100.0%) subjects were included in the PK and PD 
analysis sets. All 66 (100.0%) subjects completed the last study visit. There were no withdrawals from 
the study due to an adverse event (AE), death, protocol violation, withdrawal by subject, or any other 
reasons. 
A total of 66 subjects were enrolled in Cohorts 1 to 5, with low and high dose groups, as follows:

Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics results
Pharmacokinetics 
The emerging PK concentration-time data from completing subjects from Studies U157 and DU176b-A-
U312 were analysed using model-based PopPK approaches in an ongoing basis and used to predict and 
optimize the doses required to obtain targeted exposures in subsequent age cohorts and dose groups 
(high dose group after the PK data in the low dose group). 
The paediatric dataset used in the PopPK analysis included data from 59 subjects from the single-dose 
paediatric study (U157) and data from 55 subjects from the multiple-dose paediatric study (DU176b-A-
U312), with a total of 405 concentration samples from these 114 paediatric subjects. A total of 106 
concentration samples were available after multiple doses of edoxaban and 299 concentration samples 
after a single dose. 
Table 4 presents the number of samples in each age cohort by study. Table 5 presents the summary of 
the continuous covariates of interest.

Population Pharmacokinetic (PopPK) Analysis
The edoxaban paediatric PK was best described by a 2-compartment model with linear CL/F, and with 
allometric body weight exponents (0.75 for clearances and 1 for volumes). The model that 
incorporated a maturation function for clearance (via a post-menstrual age [PMA] effect on CL) 
demonstrated an improved fit to the data.
The covariate effect of age was incorporated to account for PK in the youngest patients. The population 
median CL/F and V/F were estimated to be 42.9 L/h and 198 L, respectively. For more information 
regarding the final population PK parameters, please see Table 6.

The model was also used to estimate individual paediatric subject exposures (AUC from time 0 
extrapolated to infinity [AUCinf]) and compared to adult references (steady-state AUC over the dosing 
interval) of 30 mg or 60 mg, depending on the dosage group, to assess whether the individual 
exposures were within the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the median target adult exposure. The 
appropriateness of the dose in an age cohort was assessed by comparing the median exposure in that 
dose group with the median adult exposure. If the median paediatric exposure was within the 0.5- to 
1.5-fold of the adult VTE exposure at the 60-mg QD dose, the paediatric dose was considered 
appropriate. 
The individual estimates of AUCinf in all subjects in Cohorts 1 to 4 were within the 90% CI of the adult 
steady-state exposures. In Cohort 5 (birth to <6 months), exposure in 1 of the 6 dosed subjects was 
outside the 90% CI of the adult exposure. This was the only subject who was <28 days old and 
received the 0.8-mg/kg dose (the paediatric dose predicted to give exposure similar to adult 60 mg 
QD). Across all cohorts, the median exposure was within the 0.5- to 1.5-fold of the adult VTE exposure 
at the corresponding dose strength (30 mg QD for low dose and 60 mg QD for high dose). 
The nominal doses (for low and high dose groups, respectively), as determined in the PopPK analysis, 
were 30 mg and 60 mg for Cohort 1, 24 mg and 45 mg for Cohort 2, 0.7 mg/kg and 1.4 mg/kg for 
Cohort 3, 0.75 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg for Cohort 4, and 0.4 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg for Cohort 5.

Mean Plasma Concentrations of Edoxaban 
The plasma concentration-time profiles for different age cohorts were found to be visually similar. 
Edoxaban was absorbed rapidly after oral administration in all age cohorts in both the high dose and 
low dose groups. The highest plasma concentrations of edoxaban and edoxaban’s metabolite D21-2393 
were observed within 0.5 to 3 hours after oral administration for both high dose and low dose groups 
in all age cohorts. 
The high dose of edoxaban produced higher exposure compared to low dose in all age cohorts. Rapid 
clearance after achieving peak concentration was observed for both the high and low dose groups in all 
age cohorts.

The simulated estimated individual plasma edoxaban area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 
for subjects in each cohort demonstrated that the proposed dose regimens in the paediatric population 
resulted in similar exposures to those observed in adults with VTE who were administered edoxaban at 
60 mg QD. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The PD blood samples were collected for the estimation of biomarkers of coagulation (prothrombin 
time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], and anti-FXa). 
Mean PT, aPTT, and anti-FXa values increased following edoxaban administration, with peak values 
observed approximately 1.5 to 3 hours post-dose followed by a rapid decrease until 4 to 8 hours post-
dose and a slower decline after 8 hours. The curves of mean PT, aPTT, and anti-FXa versus time were 
similar for the high dose and low dose groups in all age cohorts. 
The following PD correlations were observed: an approximately linear relationship between antiFXa and 
PT with limited dose response increase, an approximately flat relationship between antiFXa and aPTT 
without dose response, and an approximately linear relationship between antiFXa and edoxaban 
concentration with dose response increase.

Safety results
Analysis Set for Safety 
The Safety Analysis Set included 66 subjects overall, approximately evenly distributed among all age 
cohorts and between dosing groups within each age cohort. The dosing groups included 6 to 8 subjects 
per group. 
All 66 (100.0%) subjects were included in the PK and PD analysis sets. All 66 (100.0%) subjects 
completed the last study visit. There were no withdrawals from the study due to an adverse event 
(AE), death, protocol violation, withdrawal by subject, or any other reasons. 
Extend of Exposure 
All subjects received 1 dose of the study drug under the supervision of clinical study personnel. 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
Brief Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
Overall, 15 (22.7%) subjects experienced TEAEs, of whom the majority were mild in severity, resolved 
without any sequelae, and did not require any medical intervention. No severe TEAEs were observed. 
Given the small number of subjects in each group, the number of TEAEs in the low and high dose 
groups in each cohort was comparable. Overall, 5 (7.6%) subjects experienced drug-related TEAEs, of 
which all were mild in severity. 
No deaths were reported during the study. No subjects in the Safety Analysis Set experienced TESAEs 
or study drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) during the study, and no subjects discontinued 
study drug due to a TEAE. 
In addition, 2 subjects experienced 3 SAEs in the screening phase and did not receive the study drug; 
therefore these SAEs were not treatment emergent. Both subjects had a medical history of sickle cell 
disease. 
Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events

U157 (U157) “A Phase 1, Open-label, Single-dose, Non-randomized Study to Evaluate 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Edoxaban in Pediatric Patients”. This study is part of the 
PIP EMEA-000788-PIP02-11-M11 (PIP Study 13). In addition, the results of the population-based 
pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model to predict the dose in the single-dose Study U157 are included in 
Appendix 16.1.13 of the clinical study report. This modelling study refers to PIP Study 14.
Study U157 was a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, multiple-center study to evaluate PK and PD 
(a dose-finding goal) and safety of edoxaban in paediatric patients (from 38 weeks gestational age to 
<18 years) with ongoing risk of thromboembolic events. The enrolment was sequential (from older to 
younger) and 2 doses were tested (a “low” dose to achieve exposures comparable to a 30 mg adult 
dose and a “high” dose to achieve exposures comparable to a 60 mg adult dose). The study included 5 
paediatric age cohorts (12 to <18 yrs [Cohort 1], 6 to <12 yrs [Cohort 2], 2 to <6 yrs [Cohort 3], 
6 mo to <2 yrs [Cohort 4] and 0 to <6 mo [Cohort 5]) with evaluation of 2 different doses within each 
age cohort (low [subcohort a] and high dose [subcohort b]). The pharmaceutical formulations used in 
Study U157 were edoxaban 15 mg or 30 mg oral tablets (for subjects in the 12 to <18 years age 
cohort) and edoxaban granules for oral suspension (60 mg reconstituted with water to provide a 6 
mg/mL suspension for oral administration; for subjects <12 years). The study design appears 
adequate for a Phase 1 study which is not intended to test a hypothesis but rather to generate 
information that would allow dose selection (comparable to the exposure of efficacious doses in adults) 
for subsequent clinical efficacy/safety Phase 3 studies in paediatrics. 
The primary objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) of edoxaban in 
paediatric patients who might require or currently were on anticoagulant therapy, following its single-
dose oral administration. It was pursued by establishing a preliminary edoxaban paediatric population 
PK (PopPK) model as well as conducting PK simulations and proposing dose regimens for each 
subsequent dose cohort and also for the same age cohort (0 to <18 years) in the ongoing multiple-
dose Phase 3 Study DU176b-A-U312. No efficacy endpoints were planned in the hereby submitted 
study. Measurements used in this study are considered acceptable as they are standard for a Phase 1 
dose-finding study for subsequent clinical efficacy/safety Phase 3 edoxaban studies in paediatrics. 
A total of 66 patients, out of 100 patients screened, were enrolled during the study period (from 05 
November 2014 to 16 September 2021). This study was conducted at 32 clinical sites in the United 
States, Canada, France, India, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. 
Paediatric patients who received edoxaban (n=66) were approximately evenly distributed among all 
age cohorts (15 subjects in Cohort 1, 13 subjects in Cohort 2, 13 subjects in Cohort 3, 13 subjects in 
Cohort 4 and 12 subjects in Cohort 5). The dosing groups included 6 patients (subcohorts 2b, 3b, 4b, 
5a and 5b), 7 patients (subcohorts 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a) or 8 patients (subcohort 1a) per group. The 
edoxaban paediatric PK was best described by a 2-compartment model with allometric body weight 
exponents (0.75 for clearances and 1 for volumes). The plasma concentration-time profiles for 
different age cohorts were found to be similar. The high dose of edoxaban produced higher exposure 
compared to low dose for all age cohorts. The curves of mean PT, aPTT, and anti-FXa versus time were 
also similar for the high dose and low dose groups in all age cohorts. Approximately linear relationships 
were observed between antiFXa and PT with limited dose response increase and between antiFXa and 
edoxaban concentration with dose response increase. An approximately flat relationship between 
antiFXa and aPTT without dose response was observed. The hereby submitted PK/PD results should be 
interpreted with caution as the Phase 3 studies are currently ongoing. A final pooled analysis of all of 
the paediatric PopPK and the corresponding report will be generated once the studies are completed. 
With regards to safety, edoxaban was well tolerated when administered orally in a single low dose or 
single high dose to paediatric patients from 38 weeks gestation (0 months) to <18 years of age. Four 
patients in Cohorts 1a/1b, 6 patients in Cohorts 2a/2b, 1 patient in Cohorts 3a/3b, and 4 patients in

Cohorts 4a/4b experienced TEAEs, of which the majority were mild, resolved without any sequelae, 
and did not require any medical intervention. Given the small number of patients in each group, the 
number of TEAEs in the low and high dose groups in each cohort was comparable. No severe TEAEs 
were observed. One patient in Cohorts 1a/1b, 2 patients in Cohorts 2a/2b, 1 patient in Cohorts 3a/3b, 
and 1 patient in Cohorts 4a/4b experienced drug-related TEAEs, of which all were mild. No patients in 
Cohorts 5a/5b experienced any TEAEs. In the 12 to <18 years age cohort, 1 patient treated with high 
dose of edoxaban (Cohort 1b) had PT prolonged (without bleeding), which was considered to be 
related to edoxaban. In the 6 to <12 years age cohort, 1 patient treated with high dose of edoxaban 
(Cohort 2b) had aPTT prolonged (without clinical impact), which was considered to be related to 
edoxaban. There were no deaths during the study. No patients experienced TESAEs or study drug-
related SAEs during the study, and there were no TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug. Two 
patients experienced 3 SAEs in the screening phase and did not receive the study drug. No clinically 
meaningful changes in chemistry or hematology laboratory evaluations, or vital signs were observed.
Overall, the safety profile of edoxaban observed in the paediatric study DU176b-A-U157 was consistent 
with the already known safety profile of edoxaban in adults with NVAF and venous thromboembolism.
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation
In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH 
hereby submits to the EMA a final study report for the study number DU176b-A-U157, which is part of 
the PIP EMEA-000788-PIP02-11-M11 (PIP Study 13). In addition, the results of the population-based 
pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model to predict the dose in the single-dose Study U157 are included in 
Appendix 16.1.13 of the clinical study report. This modelling study refers to PIP Study 14.
Study DU176b-A-U157 was a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, multiple-center study to evaluate 
PK and PD (a dose-finding goal) and safety of edoxaban in 66 paediatric patients (from 38 weeks 
gestational age to <18 years) with ongoing risk of thromboembolic events.
A PopPK model was developed describing the PK of edoxaban in the paediatric subjects (birth to <18 
years of age). Model-estimated edoxaban AUCinf for all cohorts of study DU176b-A-U157 
demonstrated that the proposed dosing regimens in the paediatric population would be expected to 
result in exposures that are aligned with those in adult VTE patients administered edoxaban at 60 mg 
QD. A final pooled analysis of all of the paediatric PopPK and the corresponding report are expected to 
be generated once the studies are completed.  
Overall, the safety profile of edoxaban observed in the paediatric study DU176b-A-U157 was consistent 
with the already known safety profile of edoxaban in adults with NVAF and VTE.

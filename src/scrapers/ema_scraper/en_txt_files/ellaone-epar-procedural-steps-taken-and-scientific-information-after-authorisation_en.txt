1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC and PL 
Based on the data retrieved during the 5 year renewal 
period since launch of EllaOne, the benefits of the product 
continue to outweigh the risks.  
The results of the study of Moreau (2012) (pooled Phase III 
studies of UPA) suggest a (non statistically significant) 
decrease of efficacy of UPA among women who have 
further unprotected intercourse in the same cycle, 
especially if they are morbidly obese. The impact of higher 
body weight/BMI on the efficacy of emergency 
contraceptives (levonorgestrel-containing medicinal 
products and ellaOne) will be further evaluated in a referral 
under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC. The assessment 
of all data collected and any necessary follow-up affecting 
ellaOne in this respect,  will be handled within the context 
of the Article 31 Referral EC (Procedure number: ellaOne 
EMEA/H/A-31/1391/C/001027/0028). 
The product information has been updated to reflect post-
Page 7/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
marketing data and pre-clinical data that have become 
available since initial marketing authorisation, and to bring 
it in line with the current Agency template. 
The risk-benefit balance for ellaOne remains positive; the 
CHMP recommends that the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation of ellaOne be granted with unlimited validity.

information based on a clinical Drug-drug interaction 
study with a CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin). In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the

CYP3A4 inducer, based on the results of interaction study 
(Study HRA2914-551).  
The potential for interaction (as previously stated) has now 
been confirmed by the results from the DDI study. Results 
showed that the administration of ulipristal acetate with a 
CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampicin markedly decreases 
Cmax and AUC of ulipristal acetate by 90% or more and 
decreases ulipristal acetate half-life by 2.2-fold

ellaOne and is therefore not recommended.  
During the procedure the CHMP requested additional 
amendments to the Product Information in addition to the 
changes proposed by the MAH: the text on interactions 
(including newly proposed text) is moved from SmPC 
section 5.2 to section 4.5 as the new data submitted

(including efavirenz, fosphenytoine, nevirapine, 
oxcarbazepine, primidone, rifabutine).  The package leaflet 
text section 2 is updated in accordance with the SmPC. 
Updates to the list of contact details of local representatives 
in the Package Leaflet (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia,

HRA2914-514 was designed to investigate the 
pharmacokinetics of ulipristal acetate in healthy 
breastfeeding women who take 30 mg and the amount of 
drug transferred into human milk. The PL is updated 
accordingly 
Study HRA2914-514 was a pharmacokinetic study 
consisting of a single dose of 30 mg ulipristal acetate 
followed by a blood and milk sampling period of 120 hours 
in lactating women. The concentrations in breast milk for 
UPA and monodemethylated-UPA over time followed the 
same profile as those in plasma but were lower than the 
plasma concentrations. After a 48-72 hour period after 
dosing the total amount excreted ulipristal in milk was less 
than 0.004% of the total administered dose. At 120 hours 
after UPA administration, both UPA and its main active

ketoconazole, esomeprazole and fexofenadine, the 
applicant proposed to adapt the SmPC and PL based on the 
results of the submitted studies (SmPC section 4.4, 4.5, 
and 5.2). As the interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors and P-
gp substrates is shown to be of no clinical relevance, it was 
agreed to omit this information in SmPC 4.4 and 4.5; the in 
vivo interaction results are shortly mentioned in section 5. 
With regard to the interaction with esomeprazole, as the 
clinical implications of a 65% decrease in ellaOne Cmax are 
unknown, no specific recommendations can be given in the 
SmPC. Therefore some information on esomeprazole should 
remain in the SmPC in section 4.5, but can be omitted in 
section 4.4. 
The benefit-risk for ellaOne in the indication of Emergency 
contraception within 120 hours of unprotected sexual

HRA2914-476 and HRA2914-477 describe the effects of 
ulipristal acetate on CYP3A4 activity and study HRA2914-
479 characterises the interaction of ulipristal acetate with 
the P-gp transporter. SPC section 4.4 was revised 
accordingly. In addition in SPC section 4.8 an inconsistency 
in frequencies of adverse reactions was corrected.  
SPC section 5.1 was updated following granting of the ATC 
code (G03AD02) by WHO.  
The PL is amended accordingly; in addition details of local 
representatives in the PL were updated for France and 
Ireland and Annex II was updated in line with QRD wording 
on the RMP.

Changes in the manufacturing process of the finished 
product  in the new added manufacturing site.

manufacturing site for the FP - Site where any 
manufacturing operation(s) take place, except batch-
well as a meta-analysis of studies HRA2914-513 and 
HRA2914-507. 
Results from study HRA2914-511 show that ellaOne is able 
to postpone follicular rupture in some women even when 
taken immediately before ovulation is scheduled to occur. 
Study HRA2914-513 is a prospective, randomized, single 
blind, multicenter comparative study of 
the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ulipristal acetate 
versus levonorgestrel as emergency contraception. The SPC 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 were updated with results from this 
study and the meta-analysis. As a limited number of 
patients under 18 years were included in this study, this is 
also mentioned in SPC section 4.2.  
The package leaflet was amended accordingly.  In addition 
changes in contact details of the local representatives, and 
a correction of spelling of the invented name (in SPC, 
labelling and package leaflet) in line with spelling in the 
approved mock-ups.

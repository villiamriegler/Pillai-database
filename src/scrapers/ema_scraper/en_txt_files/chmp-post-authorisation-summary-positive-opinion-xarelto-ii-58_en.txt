Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Xarelto 
rivaroxaban 
On 26 July 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Xarelto. 
The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Bayer AG. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication for Xarelto 2.5 mg tablets as follows2: 
“Xarelto, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of 
atherothrombotic events in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or symptomatic 
peripheral artery disease (PAD) at high risk of ischaemic events.” 
For information, the full indications for Xarelto 2.5 mg tablets will be as follows: 
“Xarelto, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or 
ticlopidine, is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients after an 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac biomarkers (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Xarelto, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention 
of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or 
symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) at high risk of ischaemic events.” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

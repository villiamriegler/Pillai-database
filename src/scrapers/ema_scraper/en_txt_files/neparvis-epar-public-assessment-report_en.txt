Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Novartis Europharm Ltd submitted on 14 January 2016 an application for Marketing Authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Neparvis, through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (2) (b) 
of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP 
on 17 December 2015. The eligibility to the centralised procedure under Article 3(2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 was based on demonstration of significant therapeutic innovation. 
The Applicant applied for the following indication: 
- Neparvis is indicated in adult patients for treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction (see section 5.1). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC – relating to informed consent from a marketing authorisation holder for 
an authorised medicinal product. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information with a letter from Novartis Pharma AG 
allowing the cross reference to relevant quality, non-clinical and/or clinical data. 
This application was submitted as a multiple application of Entresto authorised on 19 November 2015 in 
accordance with Article 82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0240/2015 
on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0106/2014 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of 
Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. The MAH of the reference product, Entresto, has provided consent to allow 
access to Module 2 to Module 5 of the initial dossier and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, 
assessed and approved. The reference product, Entresto had been submitted as a full application under Art 8(3) 
of Directive 2001/83/EC. As a consequence, the quality, safety and efficacy of Neparvis are identical to the up 
to date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Entresto. 
Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome that results from structural or functional impairment of 
ventricular filling or ejection. It is a major public health problem associated with a high mortality rate, frequent 
hospitalizations and poor quality of life. HF is a progressive disease characterized by increasing symptoms that 
lead to repeated hospitalizations and a significantly greater risk of premature death. A total of 1.0 million 
patients are hospitalized due to HF each year in the US (Askoxylakis et al 2010) and in Europe, approximately 
5% of all acute hospital admissions are HF-related (Braunschweig et al 2011). Approximately 40% of HF 
patients admitted to the hospital will either die or be readmitted within 1 year and nearly 50% of HF patients die 
within 4 years of diagnosis (Dickstein et al 2008). The overall 5 year survival rate for HF is as poor as or worse 
than that for advanced cancer or stroke (Askoxylakis et al 2010, Stewart et al 2010).

Neurohormonal pathways are of critical importance in the pathogenesis and progression of HF. Current HF 
therapies mainly focus on blocking the detrimental effects of long-term neurohormonal activation (ACEis, ARBs, 
β-blockers and MRAs) and largely ignore the physiological compensatory effect of the natriuretic peptide system 
and other endogenous vasodilator systems. Inhibition of neprilysin results in an increase in the activity of 
natriuretic peptides (NPs) and other vasoactive peptides that potentially exert favorable long-term 
compensatory effects. However, neprilysin inhibition also leads to an increase of angiotensin II, which is a major 
mediator of HF development and progression. Therefore, the full compensatory benefit of NEP inhibition can only 
be leveraged if both the RAS and NEP systems are inhibited simultaneously. Omapatrilat, a dual ACEi/NEPi, was 
no more effective than an ACEi alone in reducing the risk of death and HF hospitalization in the OVERTURE study 
of 5,770 HF patients; it was suspected that once-daily dosing of omapatrilat did not provide 24-hour NEP and 
ACE-inhibition (Packer et al 2002). In addition, omapatrilat treatment was associated with an increased 
incidence of serious angioedema with airway compromise requiring mechanical support (Kostis et al 2004). 
The LCZ696 HF clinical development program was designed to determine whether treatment with LCZ696 could 
provide a greater benefit in CV mortality and morbidity reduction compared to an ACEi, in HF patients who have 
been well treated with other HF guideline-recommended therapies. The pivotal phase 3 trial CLCZ696B2314 
(also known as PARADIGM-HF) was designed to accomplish this purpose. 
LCZ696 (sacubitril/valsartan, Neparvis) is a novel therapy proposed for treatment of heart failure (HF) (New 
York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV) in patients with systolic dysfunction (reduced ejection fraction, 
HFrEF). Following oral administration, LCZ696 dissociates into valsartan and the pro-drug sacubitril (also known 
as AHU377, a new molecular entity), which is further metabolized to the neprilysin inhibitor LBQ657. LCZ696 
exhibits the mechanism-of-action of an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) by simultaneously 
inhibiting neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase 24.11; NEP) via LBQ657 and blocking the angiotensin II type-1 
(AT1) receptor via valsartan, resulting in complementary effects on the cardiovascular (CV) system that are 
beneficial in HF patients.  
LCZ696 is formulated as film-coated tablets and each tablet contains sacubitril and valsartan as sacubitril 
valsartan sodium salt complex in the following strengths: 24 mg/26 mg, 49 mg/51 mg and 97 mg/103 mg. The 
24 mg/26 mg, 49 mg/51 mg and 97 mg/103 mg strengths are in some publications/studies referred to as 50, 
100 or 200 mg.  
The following indication was granted by the CHMP to Neparvis (identical to the indication of the reference 
product Entresto): 
Neparvis is indicated in adult patients for treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction.  
The recommended posology is: 
The recommended starting dose of Neparvis is one tablet of 49 mg/51 mg twice daily, except in the situations 
described below. The dose should be doubled at 2-4 weeks to the target dose of one tablet of 97 mg/103 mg 
twice daily, as tolerated by the patient.  
In addition, in patients not currently taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB or taking low doses of these medicinal 
products, a starting dose of 24 mg/26 mg twice daily and slow dose titration (doubling every 3-4 weeks) are 
recommended. Also, a starting dose of 24 mg/26 mg twice daily should be considered for patients with SBP ≥
100 to 110 mmHg. Also patients with other co-morbidities e.g. moderate renal or hepatic impairment are 
advised to initiate treatment with the lower dose. The CHMP agreed that LCZ696 should not be co administered 
with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB. Due to the potential risk of angioedema when used concomitantly with an ACE

inhibitor, it must not be started for at least 36 hours after discontinuing ACE inhibitor therapy. Finally, the 
valsartan contained within LCZ696 is more bioavailable than the valsartan in other marketed tablet 
formulations. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of Entresto, the quality data in support of the Neparvis application 
is identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Entresto dossier, which has been assessed and approved, 
including all post-marketing procedures. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Reference has been made to Module 4 data for Entresto, no additional studies have been provided. Since this 
application is an informed consent of the Entresto application, the non-clinical data in support of the Neparvis 
application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Entresto dossier, which have been assessed 
and approved, including all post-marketing procedures. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has referred to the Environmental Risk Assessment for Entresto (version dated 28 May 2015). 
Marketing of Neparvis in the European Union is not expected to increase the environmental risk.  
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In this informed consent application, there are no new issues related to the non-clinical data. All the non-clinical 
data have been assessed in the application for reference medicinal product, Entresto and adequately reflected in 
the Product Information. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Reference has been made to Module 5 data for Entresto and no additional studies have been provided. Since this 
application is an informed consent of the Entresto application, the clinical data in support of the Neparvis 
application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Entresto dossier, which have been assessed and 
approved, including all post-marketing procedures. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical aspects 
In this informed consent application, there are no new issues related to the clinical data. All the clinical data have 
been assessed for Entresto application and adequately reflected in the Product Information. 
Assessment Report

2.5.  Risk Management Plan 
A risk management plan (RMP) version 1.1 – 14 March 2016 was provided for Neparvis. This RMP corresponds 
to the Entresto RMP version 1.4, which is the current version (as approved during MAA of Entresto). Only the 
cover page of the RMP was updated to make it applicable for Neparvis. 
2.6.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.  Product information 
Product information of Neparvis is identical to the product information for Entresto and was assessed at the time 
of the IMA application for Entresto. Additionally, the Applicant has aligned the PI annexes with the latest version 
of the QRD template (v10 - counterfeit legislation), i.e. to implement the standard statements on the Unique 
Identifier (UI) and its carrier under sections 17 and 18 of Annex IIIA. 
The applicant provided the user testing as previously submitted for Entresto. It was confirmed that the package 
leaflet meets the criteria for readability.  Consultation with target patient groups has not been undertaken for 
Neparvis. The content of the package leaflet is identical to the approved leaflet of Entresto and therefore no 
further testing was warranted. 
2.7.1.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Neparvis (SACUBITRIL / VALSARTAN) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
This Marketing Authorisation application for Neparvis has been submitted by Novartis Europharm Ltd as an 
informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2011/83/EC, as amended. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Neparvis medicinal product are identical to the up-to-date 
quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Entresto. The application for Neparvis concerns the identical strengths 
to those approved for Entresto and consists of only Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion can be 
found in the Entresto CHMP assessment reports and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published 
on the EMA website.

Consequentially, and in line with the assessment of data undertaken in the framework of the Entresto initial 
marketing authorisation application as well as within all post-autorisation procedures, the CHMP considers that 
the benefit/risk balance for Neparvis is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Adcirca is currently authorised in the EU as 20 mg film-coated tablets for oral use for the following 
indication: 
ADCIRCA is indicated in adults for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity (see section 5.1). 
Efficacy has been shown in idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and in PAH related to collagen vascular 
disease. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) submited an application for Adcirca (tadalafil) for the 
following proposed new indication for paediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) specifically: 
“Treatment of paediatric patients aged 6 months to 17 years old with PAH classified as WHO functional 
class II and III. Efficacy in patients ≥ 6 years in terms of improvement of exercise capacity has been 
shown in IPAH and PAH associated with surgical repair of at least 6-month duration of simple 
congenital systemic to pulmonary shunt.” 
Paediatric PAH is a rare and complex condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The 
aetiology of PAH in the paediatric population is predominantly idiopathic (idiopathic pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (IPAH)) or associated with congenital heart disease.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Accurate estimates of the prevalence and incidence of PAH in children do not exist. However, it is 
believed to be significantly lower in children than in adults (1 to 2 adults per million).  
It has been estimated that about 0.5 per million children are diagnosed with IPAH yearly, which 
accounts for about 50% of all paediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (pPAH).  
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 9/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
WHO defined 5 different groups of pulmonary hypertension based upon different causes. Pulmonary 
arterial hypertension refers to WHO Group 1.  
PAH disease aetiologies are described in the following table. The more frequent aetiologies in children 
are idiopathic, heritable, associated with connective tissue disease and associated with congenital heart 
disease. Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn remains in the PAH group but has been 
moved to a subgroup (Subgroup 1’’ within group 1), as it is considered to be a specific entity with a 
more transient course in most cases. 
GROUP 1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension 
1.1 Idiopathic 
1.2 Heritable (familial) 
1.2.1 BMPR2 mutation 
1.2.2 Other mutations 
1.3 Drugs and toxins induced 
1.4 Associated with: 
1.4.1 Connective tissue disease 
1.4.2 HIV infection 
1.4.3 Portal hypertension 
1.4.4 Congenital heart disease 
1.4.4.1. Eisenmenger’s syndrome 
Includes  all  large  intra-  and  extra-cardiac  defects  which  begin  as  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts  and 
progress  with  time  to  severe  elevation  of  PVR  and  to  reversal  (pulmonary-to-systemic)  or  bidirectional 
shunting; cyanosis, secondary erythrocytosis, and multiple organ involvement are usually present. 
1.4.4.2. PAH associated with prevalent systemic-to-pulmonary shunts 
• Correctable 
• Non-correctable: Includes moderate to large defects; PVR is mildly to moderately increased, systemic-
to-pulmonary shunting is still prevalent, whereas cyanosis at rest is not a feature. 
1.4.4.3. PAH with small/coincidental defects 
Marked  elevation  in  PVR  in  the  presence  of  small  cardiac  defects  (usually  ventricular  septal  defects  <1 
cm  and  atrial  septal  defects  <2  cm  of  effective  diameter  assessed  by  echo),  which  themselves  do  not 
account  for  the  development  of  elevated  PVR;  the  clinical  picture  is  very  similar  to  idiopathic  PAH. 
Closing the defects is contra-indicated. 
1.4.4.4. PAH after defect correction 
Congenital  heart  disease  is  repaired,  but  PAH  either  persists  immediately  after  correction  or 
recurs/develops  months  or  years  after  correction  in  the  absence  of  significant  postoperative 
haemodynamic lesions. 
1.4.5 Schistosomiasis

Respir J. 2015; 46: 903–75 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Although the clinical presentation of pPAH may vary according to the aetiology, the most frequent 
symptoms are dyspnoea, fatigue, chest pain, dizziness, syncope, cyanosis, palpitations and irritability. 
Progression of the disease may lead to right cardiac failure, cardiac failure, oedema, haemoptysis, 
cerebrovascular accidents from paradoxical emboli, cardiac arrhythmias, Eisenmenger syndrome and 
thrombocytopenia. The WHO functional class system was implemented for disease evaluation of

patients with PAH to define the disease severity of symptoms and disease impact on day-to-day 
activities.  
Overall, for paediatric patients with PAH, the median age at diagnosis is about 7 years. Without 
appropriate treatment, median survival rate after diagnosis of IPAH in children is about 10 months. 
The prognosis of children with PAH has improved over time due to new therapies and off-label use of 
adult PAH specific therapies being administered to paediatric patients.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Therapies that are currently approved for the treatment of PAH in adults, in various geographies 
around the world, include prostacyclin and its analogues (epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost and 
beraprost), endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs; bosentan, macitentan and ambrisentan), PDE5 
inhibitors (sildenafil and tadalafil), soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat) and selective 
prostacyclin receptor agonist (selexipag). Due to limited clinical data in children, treatment decisions 
are often extrapolated from adult studies. However, various therapies have been used to treat PAH in 
children. Most of these are based upon prior studies in adults.  
The use of PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil and tadalafil, has become very common in the 
treatment of paediatric patients with PAH and has become standard of care in pPAH. 
In the EU, bosentan, sildenafil and ambrisentan are approved for paediatric patients with PAH.  
In the US, bosentan is the only approved drug for the treatment of paediatric patients with PAH.  
Sildenafil and tadalafil are the only PDE5 inhibitors that have been approved for the adult PAH 
indication in the US, EU and Japan. 
2.2.  About the product 
Tadalafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme 
responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Pulmonary arterial 
hypertension is associated with impaired release of nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium and 
consequent reduction of cGMP concentrations within the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle. PDE5 is 
the predominant phosphodiesterase in the pulmonary vasculature. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil 
increases the concentrations of cGMP resulting in relaxation of the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle 
cell and vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed.  
Tadalafil belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of urologicals, drugs used in erectile dysfunction 
(ATC code: G04BE08).  
Tadalafil is currently approved in the EU as 20 mg film-coated tablets for oral use for the treatment of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) adult patients classified as WHO functional class II and III, to 
improve exercise capacity (see section 5.1). Efficacy has been shown in idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and in 
PAH related to collagen vascular disease.  
The claimed the therapeutic indication in paediatric population was: 
Treatment of paediatric patients aged 6 months to 17 years old with PAH classified as WHO functional 
class II and III. Efficacy in patients ≥ 6 years in terms of improvement of exercise capacity has been 
shown in IPAH and PAH associated with surgical repair of at least 6 month duration of simple 
congenital systemic to pulmonary shunt.  
The approved indication is: 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 11/101 
 
  
 
 
Paediatric population 
Treatment of paediatric patients aged 2 years and above with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
classified as WHO functional class II and III. 
This extension of the marketing authorisation also concerns the approval of a new pharmaceutical form 
(2 mg/mL oral suspension) intended to treat paediatric patients who require 20 mg of tadalafil or less 
and are not able to swallow the already authorised 20 mg film-coated tablets. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
On 1 October 2008, Tadalafil Lilly was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction in adult males (both on demand [general recommended dose 10 mg] and once 
daily [QD; general recommended dose 5 mg]). This authorisation was based on the authorisation 
granted to Cialis in 2002 (‘informed consent’). The name of the medicine was changed to Adcirca on 21 
October 2009.  
On 30 November 2009, the European Commission approved the change of the indication of Adcirca 
(previously known as Tadalafil Lilly) from the treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males (20 mg 
on demand, maximum once per day) to the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in 
adults classified as WHO functional class II and III (40 mg [2 x 20 mg] once daily). For further 
information as regards this variation procedure (EMEA/H/C/1021/II/0001), please see: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/variation-report/adcirca-h-c-1021-ii-0001-epar-
assessment-report-variation_en.pdf 
The safety and efficacy of tadalafil for the treatment of PAH in adults have been investigated in a 16-
week placebo controlled study (Study H6D-MC-LVGY [LVGY]) which demonstrated that tadalafil 40-mg 
once-daily dosing is effective in the treatment of adult patients with PAH and is associated with an 
increase in exercise capability.  
This application for tadalafil (Adcirca) EMEA/H/C/001021 is an extension of Marketing Authorisation to 
register a new pharmaceutical form (2 mg/mL oral suspension), grouped with a Type II variation for 
adding a therapeutic indication in paediatric patients from 6 months to 17 years old with pulmonary 
arterial hypertension.   
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

submission of a new module 3.2.S.5 (reference standards). 
The current specification of tadalafil active substance is acceptable for manufacturing of the finished 
product and there is no need for addition of other parameters. The acceptance criterion for the particle 
size is suitable for the oral suspension. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a white to practically white aqueous suspension containing 2 mg/mL tadalafil.  
Co-packaged with the bottle containing the oral suspension is a 10 mL low-density polyethylene oral 
syringe with 1 mL graduation. The syringe is CE-marked. In addition, a low-density polyethylene 
press-in bottle adaptor which mates with the bottle and the syringe is provided. A declaration of 
conformity with current EU Regulation for medical devices is provided. 
The aim of formulation development was to achieve a once-daily administration form suitable for 
paediatric patients to treat patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pharmaceutical development 
of the finished product contains QbD elements, but no design space is claimed. The quality target 
product profile (QTPP) formed the basis for the design of the finished product. Definition of the QTPP 
allowed identification of potential critical quality attributes (CQAs).  
The active substance tadalafil is a BCS Class 2 compound according to the Biopharmaceutics 
Classification System with low solubility and high permeability. As the in vivo absorption of Class 2 
substances is typically dissolution rate-limited, particle size of the active substance is an important 
parameter that can affect the dissolution rate and the formulation of suspensions. The particle size of 
the approved active substance is suitable for use in the oral suspension. The active substance contains 
two chiral centres and is prepared as a single enantiomer. Stability studies conducted during 
development of the oral suspension have shown that the enantiomer is stable. 
To develop the oral suspension formulation, a prototype formulation-screening study was conducted 
using the excipients of the commercial product and several other excipients. A range of concentrations 
was studied to determine the appropriate excipients. The prototype suspensions were packaged in 
amber PET bottles and stored at 25 ºC / 60 % RH and 40 ºC / 75 % RH. Results demonstrated that the 
active substance is stable with the chosen excipients. Antimicrobial effectiveness testing was also 
conducted for the prototype formulations. The formulations containing sodium benzoate passed while 
formulations containing the parabens did not pass (see also further details below).  
The lead formulation was selected due to faster dissolution, good stability over 6 months at 25 ºC / 60 
% RH and 40 ºC / 75 % RH as well as for having satisfactory appearance, texture and processability. 
The selected excipients demonstrated very good chemical and physical stability. The excipients

enabling the suspension formulation are Avicel RC-591 and xanthan gum aided by the addition of silica 
(colloidal silicon dioxide). Avicel RC-591 allows the suspension to be re-dispersed and dispensed via an 
oral syringe. Xanthan gum is a protective colloid that increases viscosity and structure and in 
conjunction with Avicel RC-591 forms a long-lasting suspension. Silica acts as a flocculating agent and 
prevents hard packing of the particles to aid in re-dispersion. The viscosity of the suspension increases 
upon standing which helps to keep the solids suspended. Simethicone emulsion 30 % is added to 
eliminate foam and prevent foam formation. 
The oral suspension is aqueous-based and packaged in a multiple use container, thus requiring 
addition of a preservative to protect from growth of microbial organisms. Sodium benzoate was 
selected as the preservative due to its high solubility, preservative effectiveness and compatibility with 
tadalafil at an acidic pH. The antimicrobial effectiveness of sodium benzoate was studied at three 
different concentrations within the pH range. The proposed level of sodium benzoate ensures robust 
antimicrobial effectiveness throughout the product shelf-life. The level is within the acceptable intake 
of 0 – 5 mg/kg as stated in the “Questions and answers on benzoic acid and benzoates used as 
excipients in medicinal products for human use”. Sodium benzoate is an excipient with a known 
physiological effect and is thus also listed in section 2 of the SmPC.  
The remaining excipients used, and their characteristics were also discussed and the suitability and the 
amount of each of each excipient has been justified. Sweeteners and flavour are added to the 
formulation for better taste. Sorbitol liquid (crystallising) contains 110.25 mg/mL of sorbitol. As 
sorbitol is a source of fructose, the package leaflet includes information for patients with the rare 
genetic disorder of hereditary fructose intolerance as discussed in the guideline “Information for the 
package leaflet regarding fructose and sorbitol used as excipients in medicinal products for human 
use”. The artificial cherry flavour contains propylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol is below 
the limit indicated in the “Questions and answers on propylene glycol used as an excipient in medical 
products for human use”. As excipients with a known physiological effect sorbitol and propylene glycol 
are listed in section 2 of the SmPC. The theoretical sodium content from all contributing excipients 
(carmellose sodium, sodium citrate and sodium benzoate) is below 1 mmol of sodium per a 20 mg 
dose (10 mL) and therefore below the threshold for reporting in section 2 of the SmPC. 
In response to a multidisciplinary Major objection raised during the procedure, the applicant presented 
justification regarding the suitability of the excipients used in the formulation for paediatric patients, in 
line the “Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use”, in particular also 
regarding the use of sodium benzoate at a concentration of 2.1 mg/mL. The amount of each excipient 
was adequately justified based on the clinical dosing strategy. As regards quality, the use sodium 
benzoate as a preservative is acceptable due to the risk of contamination of the oral suspension during 
multiple use. The Major objection was, therefore, considered resolved. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards, with the exception of simethicone emulsion (which complies with USP) and artificial cherry 
flavour (which complies to in-house specifications). The flavouring agents comply with Regulation (EC) 
No. 1334/2008. 
During formulation development, prototype formulations were evaluated against the identified CQAs 
and other attributes including particle size distribution, viscosity, sedimentation and taste acceptance 
which are controlled by the qualitative and quantitative unit formula as well as the process equipment 
and parameters. Pre-formulation and prototype formulation data was used to define the unit formula 
and multivariate design of experiments (DoEs). The results from the DoE studies improved the 
formulation by reducing product quality attribute risks and increasing patient safety. The data on the 
compatibility of the active substance with the excipients guided the initial qualitative formula and 
quantitative targets for many excipients and the quantitative level for sorbitol. The formula was further 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 14/101 
 
  
 
 
developed to improve the taste. The studies conducted to optimise the formulation are discussed in 
detail.  
The rheological properties were investigated. Adcirca oral suspension is thixotropic (shear thinning). 
Early formulations demonstrated that high viscosities could impact the dissolution rate and therefore, 
adjustments were made to the formulation to decrease the viscosity and ensure rapid dissolution. The 
current formulation has demonstrated rapid and complete dissolution while maintaining sufficient 
viscosity to support the uniformity of the suspension during manufacturing and for up to an hour after 
shaking in the bottle. 
Sedimentation rate and re-dispersibility were studied throughout development of the suspension to 
ensure homogeneity of the product prior to dispensing a dose. Although settling of the suspension does 
occur over an extended period, the re-dispersibility results demonstrate that the suspension is easily 
re-dispersed to a homogeneous suspension by shaking the bottle according to the instructions in the 
SmPC. 
A ready-to-use oral suspension was developed to support a relative bioavailability study compared to 
approved 20 mg Adcirca film-coated tablets. Slight modifications were made to the quantitative 
composition after the relative bioavailability study to ensure appropriate pH and buffer capacity to 
enable in-use microbiological control. The formulation proposed for marketing is the same as used 
during Phase 1b/2/3 clinical trials and for primary stability studies. 
The commercial manufacturing process was developed using a QbD approach. The manufacturing 
development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessments and design of experiments to 
identify the critical process parameters. Risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect and 
criticality analysis (FMECA) method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters 
that may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was based 
on the prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as 
on the experience from formulation development, process design and scale-up studies. No critical 
process parameters have been identified for the ranges indicated in the proven acceptable ranges 
(PARs). No design spaces are proposed for the manufacturing process, as all combinations of PARs 
studied for each unit operation resulted in finished product with acceptable quality. 
Dosing device 
During clinical trials, the dosing device used to measure and dispense the ready-to-use oral suspension 
was a commercially available CE marked delivery device system consisting of a press-in bottle adaptor 
and a conically tipped oral syringe.  
For marketing, a commercially available CE marked press-in bottle adaptor in combination with a CE 
marked 10 mL blunt end oral syringe was selected. Graduation markings every 1 mL for the oral 
dosing syringe allow flexibility of dosing to support the possible 2 mL, 3 mL, and 10 mL doses. The 
delivery device system has met the requirements for Ph. Eur. 2.9.27 Uniformity of Mass of Delivered 
Doses from Multidose Containers for the three primary stability batches at both the low dose (2 mL) 
and high dose (10 mL). 
Compatibility of the oral suspension with nasogastric tubes 
The oral suspension can be also administered via nasogastric tubes of silicone or polyurethane 
materials. A study to confirm the compatibility of the oral suspension with nasogastric tubes of either 
polyurethane or silicone has been conducted. Different volumes of the oral suspension were tested: 0.5 
mL and 1.0 mL, delivered with a syringe of 1 mL (used for clinical trial only) and 2.0 mL, 3.0 mL and 
4.0 mL, delivered with a syringe of 5 mL (used for clinical trial only). The content of each volume of 
oral suspension was tested after dispensation into either polyurethane or silicone tubing, followed by a 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 15/101 
 
  
 
 
flush of 1 mL, 2 mL or 3 mL of NaCl 0.9 % solution. The obtained mean assay value (n = 3) were all 
between 94.9 – 99.8 %, except for a delivered dose of oral suspension of 0.5 mL, which is not a dose 
to be used. The stability of finished product in the silicone or polyurethane tubing, respectively, was 
tested for 0 – 30 minutes and no loss of active substance was observed. No related substances were 
detected, but the preservative content decreases significantly in polyurethane tubing.  
The primary packaging is an amber polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle of 240 mL with a peelable 
seal  and  child-resistant  polypropylene  (PP)  closure.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EU 
regulations.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Medical devices 
A CE-marked 10 mL low density polyethylene oral syringe with 1 mL graduation is co-packaged. 
Additionally, a low-density polyethylene press-in bottle adaptor which mates with the bottle and the 
syringe is provided. A declaration of conformity with current EU Regulation for medical devices has 
been provided. 
The oral suspension can be also administered via nasogastric tubes of silicone or polyurethane 
materials. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site. 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  five  main  steps:  mixing  of  the  ingredients,  active  substance 
dispersion,  pH  adjustment,  filling  and  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard 
manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process has been described in detail.  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  There  are  no  critical  process  parameters  for  the 
manufacture  of  tadalafil  oral  suspension.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release specifications shown in Table 5 include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form: identity tadalafil (HPLC, UV), identity sodium benzoate (HPLC, UV), assay tadalafil 
(HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), description (visual), pH (Ph. Eur.), assay sodium benzoate 
(HPLC), uniformity of mass delivered doses from multidose containers (Ph. Eur.), and microbiological 
testing for microbial enumeration and specified microorganism (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product specification includes all relevant test parameters for an oral suspension and 
complies with Ph. Eur. and EU/ICH guidelines. All proposed acceptance criteria have been sufficiently 
justified. Limit established for impurities are set in line with ICH Q3B (R2).  
Sufficient justification has been provided for the absence of routine testing for parameters such as re-
dispersibility, relative density, density, viscosity, particle size distribution and dissolution. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
on three batches using an ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 16/101 
 
  
 
 
impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the 
presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity 
controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is 
satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial-scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial-scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months 
under long term conditions (30 ºC / 35% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / NMT 25% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal 
product are representative of those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing. The stability study was carried out under low relative-humidity conditions to 
demonstrate the suitability of the finished product packaging (8-ounce amber PET bottle, a semi-
permeable container.) Therefore, the expected water loss from the container closure system was 
evaluated in addition to physical, chemical, and microbiological stability. The analytical procedures 
used are stability indicating. No significant trend has been observed and all results remained within 
specification. The potency of the finished product increases with time during storage at the low 
humidity conditions due to water loss but is expected to meet the proposed shelf-life specification. 
In addition, stability data from eight batches of oral suspension used for clinical trials and 
manufactured by an earlier development process were provided. The batches have the same unit 
formula as the commercial formulation and were manufactured at a batch size similar to the 
commercial process. The product was packaged in similar 8-ounce PET bottles and stability data cover 
the proposed shelf life. Data is available for 36 to 48 months at 25°C / 60% RH and demonstrate that 
the product is stable. All results remained within specification and no significant trends were observed.  
Water loss was monitored during stability studies to determine the amount of water egress from the 8-
ounce amber PET bottle. At the 40 °C / NMT 25% RH storage condition, the water loss was is 
acceptable in line with ICH Q1A(R2) on Stability testing of New Drug Substances and Products. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. In the photostability study, the stability of the oral suspension 
outside of the immediate packaging as well as in the amber PET bottle was studied and no changes 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 17/101 
 
  
 
 
were observed as a result of direct exposure to simulated sunlight conditions. Thus, the finished 
product is photostable. 
Result from stress testing were also presented. The studies were conducted using one primary stability 
batch and investigated stability against thermal stress when packaged in the primary container 
proposed for marketing. No adverse changes to the physical or chemical stability were observed after 
storage for 14 days at low temperature (range of -20 to <1 °C) or at high temperature (70 °C). In 
addition, the product was subjected to thermal stress in 5 freeze/thaw cycles and no negative trends 
were observed. 
In-use stability studies were performed using a primary stability batch at the initial timepoint, and a 
clinical batch aged to 24 months (representing in-use at the end of shelf-life). The study simulated real 
time dosing and rinsing using the delivery system (bottle adapter and syringe) to demonstrate 
antimicrobial effectiveness of the preservative system as well as the chemical and physical stability 
during usage. The in-use stability data from these studies as well as supporting studies demonstrated 
stability up to at least 110 days after first opening of the bottle followed by daily dosing. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and without special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. The bottle should be stored upright. The 
shelf life after first opening of the bottle is 110 days. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. During the procedure, a multidisciplinary Major Objection was 
raised in relation to the suitability of the excipients used for paediatric patients, which was 
satisfactorily resolved as discussed above. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The applicant has 
applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its manufacturing process. 
However, no design spaces were claimed.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Toxicology, safety pharmacology and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) 
studies to support administration of tadalafil in adult patients have been submitted in previous 
applications. For the proposed indication of this extension application for the treatment of paediatric 
patients with PAH, the MAH submitted toxicology data from a juvenile rat study. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
No additional pharmacology studies have been conducted for this application which is considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No additional pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted for this application which is considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The new toxicological data submitted by the MAH were obtained from a juvenile animal study, to 
investigate the potential toxic effects on the paediatric population. The studies performed included a 
repeat dose toxicity study in juvenile rats (PND14-PND90) and a toxicokinetic analysis performed in a 
satellite group. 
2.5.4.1.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
The purpose of the juvenile rat study (JAS) was to evaluate potential adverse effects of long-term oral 
administration of tadalafil on neonatal growth and development in juvenile male rats when treated 
from Postnatal Day (PND) 14 through PND 90 followed by a 30-day recovery period. In addition, a 
toxicokinetic assessment of plasma levels of tadalafil was performed in satellite animals. PND14 was 
chosen for dosing initiation because the developmental stage of rats at this age corresponds to the 
neurological developmental stage of human infants at approximately 6-months to 1 year of age.  
There were no tadalafil-related effects on survival noted at any dose level. There were 7 unscheduled 
deaths during the dosing period (including control animals). The causes of death were determined to 
be inflammatory genitourinary tract disease, suspected gavage error, or head trauma. 
Based on the lack of adverse tadalafil-related effects on survival, clinical observations, body weight, 
food consumption, clinical pathology, organ weights, and histopathology noted at any dose level during 
the dosing and recovery periods, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for male systemic 
toxicity was considered to be 1000 mg/kg, the highest dose level evaluated. In addition, no adverse 
effects on developmental landmarks and neurobehavioral endpoints were observed at 60, 200, or 1000 
mg/kg.  
Therefore, the NOAEL for developmental toxicity/neurotoxicity was considered to be 1000 mg/kg 
(AUClast at PND 14 and 91 of 337,000 and 61,100 ng•hr/mL, respectively). In addition to the results 
of the JAS, the MAH  also presented an estimation of the safety margin for paediatric population, based 
on the results of the toxicokinetic analysis (table below).

2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH submitted an updated ERA, by including the proposed new indication (PAH in paediatric 
population). The dose for paediatric patients will be based on body weight categories and the 
maximum recommended dose will be 40 mg/day.  
In accordance with the recommendations as published in "Questions and Answers document on 
‘Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use’ 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010, rev1, 2016), and in this particular case, an increase in environmental 
exposure is generally expected. PECsurfacewater calculated as 0.2 μg L−1 is over the action limit value 
established by the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP4447/00, 2006) and Phase II-tier A environmental fate and effects analysis was 
performed by the MAH. 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 20/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH conducted a JAS in rats, in which animals were dosed from PND14 to PND90. This starting 
age can be considered equivalent to an approximate age of 6 months-1 year in humans.  
No tadalafil-related findings were reported in the study and no effects on survival, clinical pathology 
parameters, developmental landmarks, neurobehavioural endpoints or histopathology were observed 
at the highest dose level (1000 mg/Kg/day). The toxicokinetic analysis and further estimation of safety 
margins showed exposure levels 7.1-fold as compared with those obtained at the intended paediatric 
dose.  
Considering that PECsurfacewater of tadalafil is above the action limit value, a Phase II environmental 
fate and effects analysis was conducted by the MAH.  
Based on the log Kow value of 2.32 tadalafil has low bioaccumulation potential, as log Kow does not 
exceed 4.5. The log Koc value reported by the OECD 121 method suggests that tadalafil has low 
adsorption to sludge, but it is only an indicative value. The guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 
2006, asks for a batch equilibrium method (OECD 106 or OPPTS 835.1110). Thus, it is necessary to 
perform a study using a batch equilibrium method, OPPTS 835.1110 or OECD 106 using 2 types of 
sludges and/or 3 soils types, and the MAH was requested to justify the use of the OECD 302A method.  
As such the MAH commits to conduct a study according to OECD 106 and also to update the 
environmental risk assessment with the measured adsorption Koc values from that study as a follow-
up measure. 
The adsorption Koc values will be determined in at least 3 soils and 2 sludges as per the Questions and 
Answers  document 
on 
the 
environmental 
risk 
assessment  guideline 
(Question  10, 
EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1, 2016) (EMA 2016).  
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No additional pharmacology or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in support of  this 
application which is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Overall, the toxicology programme in juvenile animal study did not reveal adverse tadalafil-related 
effects on survival, clinical pathology, developmental landmarks, neurobehavioural endpoints or 
histopathology at any dose level (NOAEL considered 1000 mg/Kg/day). The toxicokinetic analysis and 
further estimation of safety margins showed exposure levels of 7.1-fold as compared with those 
obtained at the intended paediatric dose.  
A new environmental OECD 106 study will be provided to complete the ERA. The MAH will submit the 
OECD 106 report and an updated ERA report by 31/03/2025. A letter of commitment has been 
submitted. 
In conclusion, the CHMP considers that the non-clinical data submitted for this extension of indication 
application is adequate to support the use of Adcirca in the approved paediatric population.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to characterise PK in paediatrics or to support 
the paediatric PAH indication. PK and PD in paediatric patients were obtained from the studies 
presented in the table above. 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
The PopPK of tadalafil in paediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years were described by a linear 1-
compartment model. 
Following oral administration of once daily (QD) dosing, tadalafil was absorbed with a median time to 
maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) of approximately 4 hours in paediatric patients (2 to 
<18 years) with PAH and was independent of body weight, similar to what was observed in adult 
patients with PAH. 
Dose has an effect on bioavailability (F). F decreased 14% when the dose increases from 20 mg to 40 
mg in paediatric patients. The extent of the difference in F between 20 mg and 40 mg in paediatric 
patients is similar to that of adults.  
Data for the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of tadalafil in children less than 2 
years of age is not available.  
To support the new paediatric indication, the MAH has submitted one bioavailability study (LVIF) to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics of tadalafil 2 mg/mL as a suspension formulation and to determine the 
relative bioavailability compared to marketed tablets (20 mg Cialis) in healthy adult subjects in fasting 
conditions. This was a single-centre, open-label, randomized, 3-period, 3-sequence, crossover, single 
dose study in healthy male and female subjects. There was a washout period of 7 days between dosing 
periods. 
The treatment sequences are shown in the table below: 
Table 4 – Tadalafil treatment sequence 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 23/101 
 
  
 
 
 
In all 18 subjects, 14 blood samples were drawn at the following time points: pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-dose. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of tadalafil were estimated by non-compartmental linear-trapezoidal rule 
using WinNonlin 5.2. 
Primary pharmacokinetic parameters 
Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞.  
Secondary pharmacokinetic parameters 
AUC0-6, AUC0-12, AUC0-24, tmax and t1/2. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  pharmacokinetic  parameters  AUC0-t,  AUC0-∞  and  Cmax  after  logarithmic  transformation 
were subjected to an analysis of variance (Mixed Procedure) with fixed factors: period, formulation and 
sequence, and subject as a random effect. 
To  assess  the  bioavailability  of  both  formulations  a  linear  mixed  effects  model  to  the  natural  log-
transformed  of  the  primary  pharmacokinetic  parameters  was  used  to  obtain  the  adjusted  geometric 
mean ratio (and associated 90 %CI) after back-transforming the difference between LS means. 
Mean  plasma  concentration  time  profiles  (linear  with  ±SD  and  semi-log)  of  20  mg  and  40  mg  of 
tadalafil are shown in the figure below (both oral suspension and tablets). 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 24/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 - Mean plasma concentration time profiles (linear with ±SD and semi-log) of 20 mg and 40 mg 
of tadalafil 
The results demonstrate that the suspension formulation is non bioequivalent to the tablet one as the 
Cmax do not fall within the acceptance limits of 80.00%-125.00%, although it is unclear what is the 
clinical relevance of this finding. 
Distribution 
Following oral administration of multiple, once daily 20- or 40-mg doses of tadalafil, the geometric 
mean V/F is 43.3 L (CV=25.8%) and 101 L (CV= 19.1%), respectively, for paediatric patients aged 2 
to <18 years in the weight range of <40 kg and ≥40 kg. 
Elimination 
The geometric mean CL/F of tadalafil is 3.09 L/h (CV=30.8%) and 2.34 L/h (CV=18.1%) at 40 mg and 
20 mg, respectively, in paediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years. Concomitant bosentan use increases 
CL/F by approximately 50%. The estimates of CL/F and the effect of bosentan on CL/F in paediatric 
patients are similar to those in adult patients with PAH. The mean terminal t1/2 for tadalafil is 24.2 
hours and 13.6 hours, respectively, for paediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years with a body weight ≥ 
40kg and <40 kg; due to smaller V/F, t1/2 for paediatric patients <40 kg is shorter. Bosentan use 
reduces the t1/2 by approximately 42% across weight groups.  
Tadalafil is predominantly oxidatively metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoform. The 
major circulating metabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. This metabolite is at least 13,000-fold 
less potent than tadalafil for phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5). Consequently, it is not expected to be 
clinically active at observed metabolite concentrations and for these reasons the methylcatechol 
glucuronide was not measured in the paediatric PAH studies.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Based on the Primary Phase 2/3 PopPK Analysis in paediatric patients, F decreases with an increase in 
dose. Due to this effect, there is a lack of dose proportionality between 20 mg and 40 mg and a 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 25/101 
 
  
 
 
 
nominal dose of 40 mg provides exposures approximating a 20- to 30-mg dose. The magnitude of dose 
effect on the F is similar to that estimated in adult patients with PAH. 
A linear PK model in regard of time adequately described the PK in paediatric patients based on the 
Phase 2/3 PopPK Analysis, indicating an absence of time-dependent PKs similar to the adult data. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
In total, the Population Pharmacokinetic (Pop PK) dataset included data from 4 trials, 2 disease 
indications [PAH and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)], 247 patients across whose ages ranged 
from 2 to 18 years at study entry and who weighed between 10.0 and 80.0 kg.

The structural population PK model was one-compartment parameterized in terms of F, Ka, CL/F, and 
V/F with IIV on F, Ka and CL/F. The IIV on V/F was near 0 and was thus fixed to 0. The final population 
PK model incorporates dose on F, bosentan use on CL and weight on V.

Pediatric model-estimated post-hoc results of key PK parameters are presented in Table P06 for 
patients taking or not taking bosentan (including 1 subject taking macitentan; subjects on concomitant 
ambrisentan are included in non-bosentan results). For comparison, tadalafil PK parameters in a typical 
adult patient were estimated using the final adult (LVGY) Pop PK model and are included in the table. 
For all subjects, the differences between estimated PK parameter values in subjects not taking or 
taking bosentan reflect the effect of bosentan in the estimate of CL/F. Tadalafil PK parameters were 
summarized for each pediatric weight cohort from the pediatric-model post-hoc parameter estimates.

Figure P03 shows a comparison among PAH patients with the model estimated post-hoc AUC over one 
dosing interval at steady state (AUCss) for combined LVIG and LVHV pediatric patients compared to 
the population-calculated post-hoc AUCss of the adult LVGY trial. The plasma tadalafil concentrations in 
pediatric PAH patients were comparable to the adult LVGY exposures observed at the therapeutic 20 
and 40 mg qd doses of tadalafil. Of note, the pediatric PK concentrations at both 20 and 40-mg 
generally overlap the concentrations observed at the tadalafil 40-mg approved adult dose.

Figure 4 – Strategy to inform paediatric PBPK model for predictions in children aged from birth to <2

The model of tadalafil disposition in adults was developed in Simcyp version 18. Absorption was 
assumed to be first order, with fraction absorbed (Fa) of at least 0.8 based on only 16% of 
radioactivity (adjusted for recovery) being excreted as unchanged tadalafil in the first 48 hours after 
dosing (LVAA 1999). The fraction of the drug that escapes first pass metabolism in the intestine (Fg) 
was assumed to be 1 based on the low intrinsic clearance (CLint) and moderate permeability of 
tadalafil. Systemic clearance (CL) was assumed to be 75% CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and 25% 
through another pathway (assigned as additional human liver microsomal CLint) based on the fm 
(calculated using Equation 3.1, assuming Fg of 1) from the observed AUC ratio of 4.1 with 400 mg 
once daily ketoconazole (LVEV 2003). 
Table 8 – Simcyp input parameters for tadalafil in adults 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 31/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The PBPK model of tadalafil disposition in pediatric subjects aged 2 to <18 was developed for adults in 
Simcyp version 18. Simulations employed the Pediatric population rather than an adult Healthy 
Volunteers population. PopPK-predicted Vss reported in Troconiz et al. (2007) was reproduced in the 
pediatric model using a PBPK approach. The distribution model choice was full PBPK, and Vss was 
predicted using Simcyp method 1 (Poulin method) with a Kp scalar of 2.19. 
Takahiro and colleagues (2015) have demonstrated that tadalafil is metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP3A5, 
and CYP3A7. In the model of tadalafil in adults, all CYP3A-mediated metabolism is assumed to occur 
via CYP3A4. This assumption is appropriate as adult Caucasians do not express CYP3A7, and CYP3A5 is 
only expressed in a small subset of individuals. The expression of CYP3A5 was considered negligible in 
the pediatric model, as in the adult model. However, pediatric subjects do express CYP3A7. CYP3A7 
levels at birth are much higher than adult CYP3A4 levels. Stevens and colleagues report that CYP3A7 
represents 64% to 100% of the total CYP3A protein in children aged from birth to 6 months (Stevens 
et al. 2003). CYP3A7 rapidly decreases as CYP3A4 levels rise (Lacroix et al. 1997; Stevens et al. 
2003). CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 abundances at selected ages were calculated from data provided in 
Simcyp version 18) using Equation 3.2 and Equation 3.3. Values at selected ages are compared to 
CYP3A4 abundance in adults in Table P08.

Model verification 
The PBPK model for tadalafil in adults was verified using data from multiple clinical studies following 
single 5 and 20 mg doses of tadalafil to adults, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and AUC0-24 
were well-predicted, as shown in Table P11.

In the birth to <1 month age group, increasing the CYP3A7 contribution to total CYP3A mediated HLM 
CLint reduced the PBPK-predicted mean, dose-normalized, single dose AUC0-24 by 47% to 2289 
ng*h/mL and increased the projected starting dose to 4 mg. In addition, slowing of the maturation of 
the non-specific additional hepatic clearance pathway by replacing the ‘fast’ maturation profile with a 
‘slow’ maturation profile increased the PBPK-predicted mean, dose normalized, single dose AUC0-24 by 
7% to 4629 ng*h/mL, but had no effect on the projected tadalafil starting dose. The suggested clinical 
starting dose remained at 2 mg (0.7 mg/kg).

Weight 
Weight was identified as a significant covariate on V/F, but not on CL/F of tadalafil. The relationship 
between post hoc estimates of CL/F and V/F and weight showed with every 10 kg decrease in body 
weight, V/F decreases by 13.7 L. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tadalafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of PDE5, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of 
cGMP. Studies in vitro have shown that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. Phosphodiesterase 5 is 
found in the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum, prostate and bladder, as well as in vascular and 
visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, platelets, kidney, lung, cerebellum, and pancreas. The effect 
of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other phosphodiesterases. Tadalafil is >10 000-fold more 
potent for PDE5 than for phosphodiesterase 1, phosphodiesterase 2, phosphodiesterase 4 and 
phosphodiesterase 7 enzymes, which are found in the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, leucocytes, 
skeletal muscle and other organs. Tadalafil is >10 000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE3, an 
enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels. This selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3 is important because 
PDE3 is an enzyme involved in cardiac contractility. Additionally, tadalafil is approximately 700-fold 
more potent for PDE5 than for phosphodiesterase 6, an enzyme found in the retina and is responsible 
for phototransduction. Tadalafil is also >9 000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE8, PDE9 and 
PDE10, and 14-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE11. The tissue distribution and physiological 
effects of the inhibition of PDE8 through PDE11 have not been elucidated. 
Pathophysiology of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibition as a 
Mechanism of Action for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Therapy 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with impaired release of nitric oxide by the vascular 
endothelium and consequent reduction of cGMP concentrations within in the pulmonary vascular 
smooth muscle. Phosphodiesterase 5 is the predominant phosphodiesterase in the pulmonary 
vasculature. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases the concentrations of cGMP resulting in relaxation 
of the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell and vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Exposure-Efficacy 
The parameter of 6MWD was used as the primary efficacy endpoint for efficacy evaluation in both 
LVHV (paediatric) and LVGY (adult) studies. In paediatric patients, the 6MWD was evaluated in a total 
of 35 patients in LVHV.  
Comparison of the observed data between paediatric and adult patients 
Figure P08 shows individual paediatric response over the course of Study LVHV, while Figure P09 
shows the median response in paediatric patients, as well as the adult response in LVGY (placebo, 20

mg and 40 mg dose levels, only). The observed data are comparable between paediatric and adult 
patients with PAH.

in the LVHV paediatric dataset 
Figure 9 – Median observed change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) over time in adult 
(LVGY) and paediatric (LHVH) patients 
Comparison between the observed paediatric data and model-estimated adult data 
The observed data from paediatric Study LVHV (20 mg and 40 mg) was also compared to the results of 
adult Study LVGY (40 mg only) using a modelling approach. The time course and E-R relationship for 
6MWD was previously characterised for the adult patients in the Phase 3 Study LVGY via exposure 
response modelling.  
There was substantial overlap between the observed adult and paediatric data. The LVGY model 
developed based on adult data appeared to adequately capture the central tendency of the paediatric 
data, although the 90% prediction interval appeared to under-predict the degree of variability 
observed in the study. Altogether, the results suggest comparable 6MWD response between paediatric 
patients (at 20- and 40-mg dose) and adult patients (at 40-mg dose).

Modelling of combined paediatric and adult data 
The parameters in the adult LVGY E-R model were re-estimated using the combined adult-paediatric 
dataset (Table P15). As shown in Table P15, the 95% confidence intervals for each parameter (as 
determined by the bootstrap evaluation) overlapped between models, suggesting overall similarity.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to characterise PK in paediatrics or to support 
the paediatric PAH indication. 
Absorption 
The non-compartmental analysis of the absorption properties of tadalafil in paediatric patients aged 2 
to <18 years showed similar tmax and bioavailability properties as the adult population. A 14% 
reduction on bioavailability was observed at the highest dose (40 mg) compared to 20 mg, which 
similarly impacted the adult population. It is unclear whether the dose effect on bioavailability could be 
associated to non-linear absorption or dissolution-limited processes. No specific information regarding 
the absorption and bioavailability in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age was available due to the 
lack of experimental evidence. 
One clinical pharmacology Study, H6D-MC-LVIF (LVIF), was conducted to evaluate the PK of tadalafil 
as a suspension formulation and to determine the relative bioavailability compared to marketed tablets 
(20 mg Cialis) in healthy adult subjects to support the paediatric development program. 
The  results  demonstrated  that  the  suspension  formulation  is  non  bioequivalent  to  the  tablet  as  the 
Cmax  do  not  fall  within  the  acceptance  limits  of  80.00%-125.00%.  Since  formulations  are  not 
bioequivalent,  the  CHMP  was  not  in  concordance  with  the  MAH’s  claim  that  “Based  on  comparative 
bioavailability  data  for  the  tablet  and  the  suspension  formulations,  the  oral  suspension  and  film-
coated tablets may be interchanged at a 20-mg dose”. The clinical relevance for efficacy of a different 
absorption rate and exposure during the first hours after administration of suspension without water 
and  tablet  with  water  (with  90%  CI  for  AUC0-6  of  0.696-0.803  and  for  AUC0-12  of  0.789-0.894)  was 
discussed by the MAH. It was acknowledged that differences in Cmax are not relevant, and a slower 
absorption may be associated to less risk of Cmax related side effects.  
No new studies have been conducted in paediatrics to study the effect of food since the time of the 
adult  PAH  submission.  Food  does  not  affect  the  rate  or  extent  of  tadalafil  absorption  with  tadalafil 
dosing  up  to  and  including  40  mg  in  adults,  therefore,  recommendations  for  adult  patients  can  be 
extrapolated  and  tadalafil  may  be  administered  without  regard  to  meals  in  paediatric  patients  (2  to 
<18 years old).  
Elimination 
Tadalafil  systemic  exposure  is  highly  dependent  on  clearance  via  CYP3A4-mediated  metabolism. 
Investigations  by  (Salem  et  al.  2014)  have  demonstrated  that  hepatic  CYP3A4  increases  from  birth 
and reaches adult level by the age of approximately 2.5 years. Hence, biotransformation via CYP3A4-
mediated pathways in adults and children > 2 years of age are expected to be similar. 
Dose proportionality and time-dependency 
No information was provided regarding the time-dependency effect in paediatrics aged 2 to <18 years. 
A justification of similar behaviour in paediatrics as observed in adults was provided, although no 
experimental information was available.  
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
The clinical pharmacology properties of tadalafil have been characterized using a population-based 
analysis including PK and PD information in paediatric patients (≥2 to <18 years old) with pulmonary

arterial hypertension (PAH) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) together with a physiologically 
based PK model (PBPK) to establish the dose recommendation in pediatric patients <2 years old with 
PAH.  
In general, the dataset management, model building, and model assessment methodologies are 
considered appropriate. A pooled analysis combining 4 clinical trials (H6D-MC-LVHV, H6D-MC-LVIG, 
H6D-MC-LVGY and H6D-MC-LVJJ) in two disease indications is endorsed in order to characterize the 
time-course of tadalafil in the target population.  
The structural population PK model is a one-compartment with linear absorption and disposition 
kinetics. Parameters were estimated with good precision based on the relative standard error and the 
final parameter estimates were similar as the parameters obtained in previous population PK models 
(H6D-MC-LVIG and H6D-MC-LVJJ). The large variability associated to the absorption rate constant is 
expected due to the large inter-individual variation on the absorption across paediatric patients and the 
lack of adequate information during the absorption phase. The inclusion of inter-individual variability 
on the relative bioavailability parameter could initially help the description of the individual data due to 
differences associated with the dose level.  
The covariate analysis was conducted through the use of an SCM approach, which is endorsed by 
CHMP. However, the final covariates selected differ to the results with the SCM and the MAH explained 
that inadequate model performance justified their deletion.  
The  final  population  PK  model  seems  able  to  characterize  the  overall  tadalafil  longitudinal  PK  data  in 
the  target  population.  A  slight  over-estimation  of  V/F  could  explain  the  under-prediction  of  the  initial 
(highest) tadalafil concentrations (pc-VPC and GOF). Final parameter estimates were similar as for the 
base model and the bootstrap analysis confirmed the statistical relevance of the parameters. The inter-
individual random effects of CL and F slightly diminished, but clearly increased (125% to 163%) for ka. 
The  random  effects  were  assumed  to  be  symmetrically  and  independently  distributed  with  a  zero 
mean.  However,  random  effects  for  Ka  appears  to  have  some  bias  in  light  weight  patients  and  in 
patients aged 2 to 6 years, both groups of patients took the oral suspension formulation. In addition, 
the distribution of the absorption rate constant is also narrower for the suspension formulation. All this 
suggest  that  there  could  be  differences  in  the  absorption  between  the  suspension  and  tablet 
formulations  that  could  explain  partially  the  large  inter-individual  random  effects  that  have  been 
attributed  to  Ka.  However,  the  inclusion  of  formulation  on  ka  was  not  statistically  significant  and  did 
not  allow  to  a  reliable  estimation  of  individual  ka  values  in  younger  patients.  On  the  other  hand,  no 
relevant  trends  were  observed  on  individual  ka  values  across  different  sub-groups  of  age  or  body 
weight,  suggesting  that  the  inter-individual  random  effects  are  not  associated  to  those  covariates. 
Despite  the  large  inter-individual  variability  on  ka,  no  mechanistic  explanation  could  be  associate  to 
better characterize individual differences on the absorption rate constant.  
Comparable exposures (AUC) were observed in adults and pediatric patients with or without 
concomitant administration of bosentan, which demonstrates the adequacy of the dosing regimen 
proposed.  
A PBPK model was developed to predict the tadalafil exposure in paediatric patients < 2 years of age. 
To that end, adult data was initially considered to internally develop the PBPK model, which was 
considered adequate.  
A graphical evaluation has been conducted representing the prediction intervals obtained from the 
PBPK model with the observed experimental data in paediatric patients below 18 years of age. This 
analysis should be considered with caution, since it is highly subjective and no numerical comparison of 
PK predicted and observed exposure metrics was provided. The PBPK model over-predicts the PK 
profile compared to the observed data in paediatric patients from 4 to 8 years of age. In paediatric 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 44/101 
 
  
 
 
patients from 2 to less than 4 years of age the PBPK model is considered unreliable to characterize the 
data, since large differences in observed PK data are present and the PBPK model does not include 
95% of the observed data within the prediction intervals, but only 50% of the observed data. In 
addition, results from Figure P05 are not considered informative, since no clear understanding of the 
prediction error of Cmax at each year was provided. At 2 years of age, seems that the PBPK model 
over-predicts the Cmax and does not capture the observed Cmax of subject patients with bosentan co-
therapy, whereas at 4 years of age, the PBPK model tends to under-predict the Cmax values. On the 
other hand, Cmax levels of paediatric patients of 5 and 6 years of age are over-predicted compared to 
the observed Cmax value of patients without bosentan co-therapy. Therefore, the PBPK model seemed 
not suitable to predict the overall exposure in paediatric patients below 8 years of age and further 
refinement of the PBPK was required in order to inform for any dose schedule selection in paediatric 
patients below 8 years of age, and especially in the dose extrapolation below 2 years of age. The MAH 
updated the PBPK model to improve the overall performance on pediatric population for dose selection. 
Overall, the strategy included the improvement of the ka characterization in paediatric patients based 
on individual estimates from the popPK analysis, the adjustment of CYP3A4 maturation function to 
describe changes in CYP3A4 abundance across the different age cohorts and the improvement of Vss in 
children based on the information at steady-state. The strategy is endorsed and has improved model 
predictions at Day 1 in paediatric patients. However, at steady-state conditions, the PBPK model 
clearly over-predicts the Cmax and AUC for all paediatric patients (2-<4, 4-<8, 8-<12, and 12-<18 
years). In addition, a trend towards higher over-prediction in younger paediatric sub-groups of patients 
is observed, suggesting that model refinements of the PBPK model are not suitable enough to 
characterize the exposure of tadalafil at steady-state conditions. It is agreed by CHMP that scarce 
experimental data and large inter-individual variability was present on tadalafil plasma-concentration 
data at steady-state conditions, which may affect an adequate model verification of the PBPK platform. 
Regarding the dose recommendation, the MAH has conducted a model-based approach evaluating 
different dosing regimens in pediatric patients from 6 months to less than 1 year of age and from 1 to 
less than 2 years of age. The target AUC0-24 and AUCss were established based on adult data. Given 
the inconsistency of the refined PBPK model at steady-state conditions, it is not possible to establish 
any dose recommendation of tadalafil based on model-predicted exposure levels across the different 
sub-groups of pediatric patients at steady-state. Moreover, the PBPK model tends to provide greater 
bias for younger sub-groups of patients (especially between 2-<4 years of age), suggesting that 
maturation CYP3A4 and Kp scalars are not adequately captured. In this sense, model extrapolation to 
younger patients receiving taldalafil (<2 years of age) is not considered appropriate. Higher dose levels 
were proposed for patients from 6-<1 and 1-<2 years of age: 8 mg QD and 10 mg QD, respectively. 
Although some deficiencies have been corrected, there are still important doubts about the predictive 
capacity of the PBPK model to be able to establish a dose recommendation in population groups where 
there is no experimental evidence. 
Although from a methodological point of view the extrapolation exercise using a PBPK framework to 
support the dose recommendation in pediatric patients above 2 years of age may be endorsed, several 
concerns have been raised regarding the adequacy of the PBPK model to properly predict the tadalafil 
exposure in adults and pediatric patients below2 years old.  
Due to the limitations of the model to establish a dose recommendation for patients under 2 years of 
age the indication has been restricted for patients aged above 2 years old. 
Special populations 
Clearance of tadalafil was shown to be similar between adults and children ≥2 years of age. 
The use of similar dosing recommendations in paediatric patients (≥2 years of age) with impaired renal 
or hepatic function is endorsed.  
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 45/101 
 
  
 
 
Large differences in V/F were observed in extreme body weight patients, but no clinically relevant 
changes in Cmax is expected since different dose recommendation is provided in patients with low 
body weight.  
Drug-drug interactions 
No new data on pharmacokinetic interactions has been generated since the granting of the PAH 
indication in adults, which included detailed drug-drug interaction (DDI) data and recommendations. 
The clinical evaluation of the effects of tadalafil as victim’s or perpetrator’s drug is scarce and similar 
for those DDI as observed in adult patients.  
Since tadalafil is metabolized through CYP3A4 pathway, concomitant administration with strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided. The impact of CYP3A4 inducers (bosentan) on the 
pharmacokinetics of tadalafil in pediatric patients revealed 30-32% less exposure in patients with 
concomitant administration of bosentan. 
The clearance of tadalafil is similar between children ≥ 2 years of age and adults. As such, 
recommendations regarding precautions for use and adjustment of doses in adults are applicable for 
children over 2 years of age. 
Exposure-efficacy 
The relationship between exposure and efficacy (6MWD) has been established in paediatric patients 
using a previously developed population PK/PD model in adults receiving 40 mg tadalafil. The results of 
the combined dataset analysis suggest that similar parameter estimates and adequate description of 
the observed data is present. The current PK/PD analysis revealed an increase in 6MWD over time, but 
no differences in the response was observed between 20 and 40 mg in paediatrics, which indicates that 
the dose recommendation allows to provide similar efficacy outcome. In addition, the efficacy was 
comparable with the results from the adult population, which confirmed that the similar exposure in 
paediatrics is expected to reach similar efficacy as well.  
Exposure-safety 
Exposure-safety was analysed in the LVHV, LVIG, and LVJJ studies. The analysis contains comparison 
of Adverse Events by quartile of estimated tadalafil AUCss. The results did not show increased number 
of AEs with increased exposure of tadalafil for any of the studies. No experimental safety data was 
available in paediatric patients under 2 years of age.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of tadalafil in paediatric patients have been characterized through a non-
compartmental analysis and the development of a population PK model. 
The characterization of the efficacy properties of tadalafil in paediatric patients from 2 to less than 18 
years of age was conducted using a previously developed population PK/PD model in adults using 
6MWD as the efficacy outcome. The results show similar behaviour over time between paediatric and 
adult patients and no relevant differences were observed between 20 and 40 mg dosing groups in 
paediatrics, which supports the adequacy of the dose recommendation. 
Overall, the available clinical pharmacology data submitted supports the use of Adcirca in the approved 
indication,

2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
A single confirmatory efficacy and safety study H6D-MC-LVHV (LVHV) has been provided to support 
the use of Adcirca in paediatric patients with PAH. 
Studies H6D-MC-LVIF, H6D-MC-LVIG, H6D-MC-LVJJ, and H6D-MC-LVGY, provided supportive clinical 
data (please refer to clinical pharmacology section for further details). The non-interventional Post-
Authorization Safety Study (H6D-JE-TD01) also provided supportive effectiveness data regarding the 
use of tadalafil in paediatric patients.

2.6.5.2.  Main study 
The main study submitted in support of  this application was the pivotal clinical trial H6D-MC-LVHV 
(LVHV).  
Study LVHV was a Phase 3, international, randomised (1:1), multicentre, 2-period (24 weeks double-
blind placebo-controlled period [Period 1] and open-label 2-years extension period [Period 2]), add-on 
(i.e. in addition to the subject’s current endothelin receptor antagonist [ERA]) study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, and population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) of tadalafil administered orally once daily in 
paediatric subjects from 6 months to less than 18 years of age with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH). The sample size was pre-specified as 34 subjects.  
Screening and eligibility evaluation was performed during an approximately 28-day period prior to 
randomization and the administration of tadalafil. Period 1 was a 24-week study drug treatment phase. 
During this study period, patients continued receiving stable ERA therapy. Period 2 was an open-label 
extension (OLE) period that evaluated the long-term safety of tadalafil while providing continued 
access to tadalafil for paediatric patients completing Period 1. Patients entering Period 1 of the study 
were stratified into 1 of 3 weight cohorts based on their weight at the time of the screening visit 
(heavy-weight: ≥40 kg; middle-weight: ≥25 kg to <40 kg; or light-weight: <25 kg) and then be 
randomized (1:1) to tadalafil or placebo.

• 
Locations of the Study LVHV:  
This was a multicenter trial. 
•  Treatments 
LVHV was a 2-period (double-blind placebo-controlled period [Period 1] and open-label extension 
period [Period 2]), add-on study where patients received the investigational product (tadalafil or 
placebo) in addition to the subject’s current endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA).  
Tadalafil  
Tadalafil was administered to patients included in the tadalafil group during the Period 1 (double-blind 
period), as well as to all patients included in Period 2 (open-label extension) of the study.  
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 52/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Patients were stratified into 3 weight cohorts to receive tadalafil: heavy-weight cohort (≥40 kg), 
middle-weight cohort (≥25 kg to <40 kg) and light-weight cohort (<25 kg). Tadalafil dose of each 
weight cohort in this study was established and redefined based on Safety Monitoring Committee 
(SMC) and Sponsor review. The selected dose for each paediatric weight cohort reflected expected 
exposures comparable to the approved 40 mg dose of tadalafil in adults. For further information 
regarding tadalafil dose selection, please refer to the sections above.  
Subjects who met all of the eligibility criteria were randomised (1:1) to receive orally once daily a fixed 
tadalafil dose based on their weight cohort (40 mg/day [2 x 20 mg tadalafil tablets] for the heavy-
weight cohort, and 20 mg/day [1 x 20 mg tadalafil tablet] for the middle-weight cohort) or matching 
placebo tablet(s) orally once daily for 24 weeks in Period 1.  
In Period 2, all subjects received tadalafil in an open-label fashion for up to 2 years. Subjects receiving 
tadalafil in Period 1 continued at the same dose in Period 2, unless the subject had changed the 
subject’s weight cohort at the end of Period 1 (at Visit 9/early termination). Subjects receiving placebo 
in Period 1 received tadalafil in Period 2 at the corresponding tadalafil dose for the subject’s weight 
cohort at entry into Period 2.  
During Period 2, the dose of tadalafil might be adjusted if the subject’s weight changed by at least 1 kg 
over or below the weight cohort thresholds of 25 kg and 40 kg. If this weight change occurs, the 
subject’s dose of study medication might be adjusted so that they were receiving the appropriate 
weight cohort-related dose. During this study period, subjects continued to receive stable ERA therapy, 
which could be adjusted at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Placebo  
Placebo was administered to patients included in the placebo group durind the Period 1 (double-blind 
period) of the study. 
ERA  
All patients received an endothelin receptor antagonist, such as bosentan or ambrisentan, during the 
whole study. 
This study design requires patients to be receiving an ERA, and allows for the use of conventional PAH 
therapies. ERAs are required, as there are sufficient data available in the adult population to 
reasonably predict safety with ERA therapy (Study LVGY). A placebo-only treatment arm is not being 
proposed for this study, as assigning paediatric PAH patients to treatment with placebo alone may be 
viewed as unethical. 
Treatment rescue 
Conventional PAH medication, including but not restricted to, anticoagulants, diuretics, digoxin, and 
oxygen therapy were allowed during the study as rescue medication. If on conventional PAH 
medication, the patient must be on stable doses with no changes (other than weight-based 
adjustments) for at least 4 weeks before screening.

•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Measure: 
Period 1 (Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled) 
- 
Improvement of 6MWD in meters, as assessed in a subset of subjects who were ≥6 years of 
age and were developmentally capable of performing a 6MWD test.  
Secondary Efficacy and Pharmacokinetic Measures: 
Period 1 (Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled) 
-  Clinical Worsening (CW) 
Time to CW and the incidence of CW. Subjects who met any of the following 5 major criteria were 
considered to have met the definition of CW: 
1. All-cause mortality 
2. Lung or heart lung transplantation 
3. Atrial septostomy or Potts shunt 
4. Hospitalization for PAH progression 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 55/101 
 
  
 
 
a.  Hospitalization for PAH progression should not have been due to a potentially 
precipitating event such as pneumonia hemoptysis, etc; however, if after the 
hospitalization was completed, the subject was discharged and the subject 
remained worse, then the subject could be assessed for CW. 
5. Worsening of PAH Subject had any of the following criteria: 
a.  New-onset syncope. 
b.  Addition of new PAH-specific concomitant therapy including, but not restricted to 
epoprostenol or treprostinil, sildenafil, vardenafil, or increase in dose of existing 
PAH specific concomitant therapy (for example, ERA). 
c. 
Increase of 1 or more in WHO functional class (Attachment 8) in the protocol 
(except for subjects already in Class IV) only for subjects who were unable to 
perform the 6MWD test. 
d.  Worsening of WHO functional class and a decrease of 20% in the 6MWD test 
(confirmed 5 to 10 days later) for those subjects who were ≥6 years of age and 
were developmentally capable of performing the 6MWD test. 
Criteria for CW (from Period 1) were adjudicated by an independent, blinded study-specific 
Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC). This adjudication was used for data analysis, and was not 
used to guide subject treatment. 
- 
Population PK characterisation 
PK was assessed by measuring steady-state plasma tadalafil concentrations. During Period 1, 
plasma tadalafil concentrations were obtained at Weeks 2, 4, 16, and 24 (Visits 3, 4, 7, 9, 
respectively). 
When pharmacodynamics and exposure–response were assessed, 6MWD was measured in 
paediatric subjects from 6 years of age and older, and who were capable of performing the test. 
During Period 1, it was assessed at Weeks 8, 12, 16, and 24. 
Period 2 (Open-Label Extension)  
- 
Incidence of and time to incidence of clinical worsening (CW) of PAH in the paediatric 
population with endpoint as overall incidence of at least 1 criterion of CW, and time to CW with 
endpoint as date of first dose to the date of CW event.  
Additional Efficacy Measures

and who were developmentally capable of performing a 6MWD test. 
-  Changes in WHO functional classification. 
•  Sample size 
The primary efficacy measure was 6MWD and it was evaluated in this study during Period 1.  
The original planned sample size was 134 subjects and an interim analysis of the 6MW data was also 
planned (approximately Q1 2017). However, the planned sample size was reduced to 34 subjects in 
conjunction with changing the primary efficacy measure (from time to CW to 6MWD) in a LVHV 
protocol amendment. This protocol amendment was approved on 13 Dec 2018 as a result of enrolment 
difficulties experienced in the study and agreed with the EMA. 
Finally, at least 34 subjects were planned to be stratified by weight and randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 
tadalafil or placebo treatment in Period 1 of this study (n=17, tadalafil; n=17, placebo). To achieve a 
representative distribution of subject’s ages, enrolment was monitored throughout the study to achieve 
≥30% of all subjects <12 years of age.  
It was considered that with 2 patients not having postbaseline 6MWD, a sample size of 32 randomized 
patients is assumed to be ≥6 to <18 years of age who are developmentally able to complete the 
6MWD test. This sample size will provide 71% power to detect a placebo-adjusted mean difference in 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 57/101 
 
  
 
 
change in 6MWD of 40 meters with a standard deviation of 60 meters and a two-sided significance 
level of 0.2.  
Regarding the rules for discontinuation of patients, the Investigator or Sponsor could stop the study or 
stop the patient’s participation in the study for medical, safety, regulatory, or other reasons consistent 
with applicable laws, regulations, and good clinical practice (GCP). 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Screening and eligibility evaluations were performed during an approximately 28-day lead-in period 
(Visits 1 to 2) prior to randomising subjects to study medication.  
Subjects were randomised (Day 1; Visit 2) to receive either placebo or tadalafil in a 1:1 ratio, based on 
weight cohort (heavy-weight, ≥40 kg; middle-weight, ≥25 kg to <40 kg; and light-weight, <25 kg), 
PAH aetiology (idiopathic-heritable, connective tissue/congenital heart disease, or other), and type of 
ERA (bosentan or other).  
Assignment to treatment groups was determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an 
IXRS. The IXRS was used to assign bottles of tablets or liquid suspension containing double-blind study 
drug to each patient. An appropriate amount of investigational product was assigned to each patient to 
cover the study visit interval. Site personnel confirmed that they have located the correct bottles by 
entering a confirmation number found on the bottles into the IXRS prior to dispensing the 
investigational product to the patient. 
•  Statistical methods 
Given the small, planned sample size (34 subjects), no formal comparisons were to be made between 
treatment groups. Hence, the overall treatment difference p-value and the visit-wise p-values was 
reported. With the exception of the primary analysis of 6MWD, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
reported for the overall treatment difference and visit wise treatment differences. 
Randomisation at Visit 2 (Day 1) was stratified by the following variables: 
•  weight cohort (heavy-weight: ≥40 kg; middle-weight: ≥25 kg to <40 kg; light-weight: <25 
kg), 
ERA medication (bosentan or other), 
pulmonary arterial hypertension aetiology (idiopathic, connective tissue disease, anorexigen 
use, and associated to surgical repair). 
• 
• 
These stratification factors, in addition to the baseline value of the analysis variable, were included as 
covariates in all the numerical models, unless otherwise specified. 
•  Efficacy:  
Efficacy analyses, except 6MWD, were performed on the Primary Analysis Population. This population 
included all data from all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study medication 
according to the randomised treatment. 
The analysis of six-minute walk distance analysis was performed on the 6MWD Analysis Population 
which included the subset of randomised subjects ≥6 to <18 years of age (at screening) who took at 
least 1 dose of study medication and were capable of performing a 6MWD test. 
For each efficacy variable, the analysis included all randomised subjects with baseline and at least 1 
postbaseline observation. Subjects with no postbaseline data for a particular efficacy endpoint were 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 58/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
excluded from the analysis of that endpoint. However, additional sensitivity analyses utilizing imputed 
values for missing post Day 1 data may be conducted for specific endpoints. 
Analyses for Period 2 only included subjects who entered Period 2.  
The comparison of change in 6MWD between tadalafil and placebo treatment groups was to be 
performed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based, mixed-model repeated measures 
(MMRM) approach. Factors in the MMRM model included visit, baseline (Day 1) 6MWD, weight cohort, 
PAH aetiology, type of ERA therapy, and treatment group. A treatment-by-visit interaction term was to 
be included. An interaction term for treatment-by-baseline value was to be evaluated and included in 
the model if the interaction term was significant at the 0.10 level (p<0.10). 
Criteria for CW (from Period 1) were to be adjudicated by an independent, blinded study-specific 
Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC). This adjudication was to be used for data analysis and was not to 
be used to guide subject treatment. 
All efficacy measures will be summarized by descriptive statistics for each treatment group. For 
continuous variables, summary statistics will include the number of observations, mean, median, 
minimum and maximum values, and standard deviation or standard error. For categorical variables, 
counts and percentages will be tabulated for each category. The 25th percentile, median and 75th 
percentile will be presented for variables that are analyzed using ranktransformed data. 
•  Safety: 
Safety analyses were conducted on the Primary Analysis Population.  
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are presented in listings and summaries by PT (preferred term; by 
descending incidence), by system order class (SOC) and PT, and also by maximum severity within 
SOC.  
• 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic: 
Plasma tadalafil concentration time data were explored graphically by dose and ERA treatment. 
Additional analyses were done using a population PK approach pooling tadalafil data across various 
studies including LVHV.  
•  Health Outcomes: 
Proportions of subjects in each of the 7 response categories (“Very Much Better” to “Very Much 
Worse”) of the CGI-I were summarized by visit. Changes from baseline (Day 1) to Weeks 16, 24, and 
endpoint in CHQ-PF28 scores were analysed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that 
included terms for baseline (Day 1) score, weight cohort, PAH aetiology, type of ERA therapy, and 
treatment group.

Abbreviations: AE=adverse event; CW=clinical worsening; I/C=inclusion criteria not met. 
•  Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 15 study centers, which enrolled participants in 9 countries (Brazil, Israel, 
Japan, Mexico, Turkey [Austria, Germany, France, and Poland from EU]). 
Period 1 (Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled) 
A total of 39 subjects were screened for the study. Four subjects were screen failures and 35 subjects 
were randomly assigned to placebo (18 subjects) or tadalafil (17 subjects) treatment in Period 1 of this 
study and received at least 1 dose of study medication. 
Period 2 (Open-Label Extension) 
In Period 2, a total of 32 subjects (15 subjects each in the placebo and tadalafil groups that completed 
Period 1, and 1 subject from each group that discontinued Period 1 due to reported potential CW) were 
assigned to tadalafil and received at least 1 dose of the study medication.  
Subjects who received placebo in Period 1 received tadalafil in Period 2 (referred to as Pla-Tad group) 
at the corresponding tadalafil dose for the subject’s weight cohort at entry into Period 2. Subjects who 
received tadalafil in Period 1 continued at the same dose in Period 2 (referred as Tad-Tad group), 
unless the subject had changed the weight cohort at the end of Period 1. 
Six subjects discontinued the study during Period 2 (1 due to an AE, 2 due to parent/caregiver 
decision, and 3 due to withdrawal by subject). The remaining 26 subjects completed Period 2 of the 
study. 
•  Conduct of the study 
Following initiation of LVHV in July 2013, the MAH encountered issues with the study implementation 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 60/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
regarding the recruitment of paediatric patients with PAH. These included: 
• 
• 
• 
disease rarity and complexity 
widespread off-label use of PAH therapies 
concerns from parents and investigators regarding the potential to be randomised to placebo, 
and 
•  multiple competing clinical trials with extremely low enrolment rate. 
During the first 5 years of Study LVHV conduct, only 34 patients had been enrolled from 59 sites 
across 17 countries, despite substantive and specific actions to improve rates of recruitment. These 
enrolment challenges were also evident in Study LVIG. 
In 2016, the MAH sought Scientific Advice to discuss the implementation issues with Study LVHV. The 
issues were further discussed in 2017 at European Medicines Agency (EMA)/Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)/Health Canada multi-stakeholder workshop with input from key opinion leaders 
and patients. The outcome of the workshop was an acceptance that large placebo-controlled studies 
are unfeasible in this population. Following these regulatory interactions, the MAH  reached an 
agreement with PDCO to (1) discontinue enrolment of Study LVHV at a smaller sample size (from 
original 134 to 34) and (2) utilise modelling and extrapolation to assess efficacy in the paediatric 
population. 
The key modifications made to Study LVHV following its initiation were: 
• 
• 
reduction in the number of patients enrolled from 134 to 34 and 
change of primary endpoint from time to first clinical worsening (CW) to improvement in 
6MWD from baseline to Week 24. 
•  Baseline data 
Period 1 (Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled) 
There were 16 male and 19 female randomized subjects in this study; the median age for the overall 
population was 14.2 years (ranged from 6.2 to 17.9 years) and 37.1% subjects were less than 12 
years of age. No subject younger than 6 years was enrolled in the study. The majority of subjects 
(25/35; 71.4%) were in the heavy-weight cohort with the remainder (10/35; 28.6%) in the middle-
weight cohort. No subjects were enrolled in the light-weight (<25 kg) cohort.  
The majority of subjects were white (26/35; 74.3%), and 7 (20%) of total enrolled subjects were from 
sites in Europe. 
For Period 1, the most common PAH aetiology was idiopathic PAH (n=26; 74.3%; with 11/18 [61.1%] 
subjects in the placebo group and 15/17 [88.2%] subjects in the tadalafil group). Remaining patients 
had a diagnosis of PAH associated with persisting or recurrent pulmonary hypertension after repair of a 
congenital systemic to pulmonary shunt (n=9; 25.7%; with 7/18 [38.9%] subjects in the placebo 
group and 2/17 [11.8%] subjects in tadalafil group). There were 80% of subjects in WHO functional 
Class II. Baseline clinical and disease characteristics for the Primary Analysis and 6MWD Populations 
included the same subjects and were therefore identical, as all subjects in the Primary Analysis 
Population were able to provide 6MWD data. The mean (SD) baseline 6MWD was 481.1 meters 
(132.77): 476.7 meters on the placebo group and 485.8 meters on the tadalafil group.

The majority of the subjects (32/35; 91.4%) were taking bosentan as concomitant ERA, 2 patients 
were on macitentan as concomitant ERA (1 in each treatment group) and in a remaining patient the 
type of ERA was not specified (see table above).  
Period 2 (Open-Label Extension) 
There were 14 male and 18 female subjects who continued to Period 2; the median age for the overall 
population was 14.4 years (ranged from, 6.2 to 17.9 years). The majority of subjects (23/32; 71.9%) 
were in the heavy-weight group with the remaining (9/32; 28.1%) in the middle-weight group. 
The majority of subjects were white (24/32; 75%), and 7/32 (21.9%) subjects were from Europe. 
For Period 2, the most common PAH aetiology was idiopathic PAH (25/32; 78.1%) and PAH associated 
with persisting or recurrent pulmonary hypertension after repair of a congenital systemic to pulmonary 
shunt (7/32; 21.9%), and the majority of subjects had WHO functional Class II (25/32; 78.1%).  
The majority of the subjects (30/32; 93.8%) were taking bosentan as concomitant ERA.  
•  Numbers analysed 
Period 1 (Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled period) 
All 35 randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication (17 subjects received 
tadalafil and 18 subjects received placebo) were included in the safety and efficacy analyses performed 
for Period 1, with the exception of the analysis of 6MWD. As 2 out of the 35 randomized subjects (1 
subject in the placebo middle-weight cohort and 1 subject in the placebo heavy-weight) were not 
capable of performing a 6MWD test, only 33 subjects were analysed for the primary efficacy measure 
(6MWD). 
The number of subjects by cohort with measurable PK samples (at Visits 3, 4, 7 and 9) were 4 subjects 
(16 total PK samples) from the middle weight cohort and 13 subjects (48 total PK samples) from the 
heavy weight cohort. 
A total of 3 subjects (2 in the placebo group and 1 in the tadalafil group) discontinued from the study 
during period 1.  
Period 2 (Open-Label Extension) 
None of the 32 subjects who entered Period 2 were excluded from the safety and efficacy analyses.  
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable (and corresponding sensitivity analyses): 
6MWD during Period 1 (Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled period) 
Since there were not at least 3 subjects per treatment at each PAH aetiology and ERA therapy level, 
neither factor was included in the model. Of the 35 randomised subjects, 33 were analysed for the 
primary efficacy measure (6MWD). 
A numerical improvement in the tadalafil group (60.48 meters) compared to the placebo group (36.60 
meters) was demonstrated at Week 24 corresponding to an LS placebo-adjusted mean (SE) difference 
of 23.88 (29.114) meters (80% CI, -14.25, 62.00).

6MWD during Period 2 (Open-Label Extension) 
In Period 2, the 6MWD mean change from baseline (Visit 9) increased by 7.73 metres at Year 1 and 
decreased by 4.58 metres at end of Period 2 (24 months) in the Pla-Tad group, and decreased by 
21.50 metres at Year 1 and decreased by 32.58 metres at end of Period 2 (24 months) in the Tad-Tad 
group.  
Six-Minute Walk Bayesian Mixed-Effects Model for Repeated Measures (Sensitivity Analysis) 
This supportive (sensitivity) analysis to the primary analysis of Study LVHV using a Bayesian MMRM 
model that leveraged data from the adult study (LVGY) was conducted to increase precision in 
confirming the 6MWD efficacy endpoint. Factors included in the Bayesian MMRM model were similar to 
the primary analysis. Factors in the MMRM model included visit, baseline 6MWD, treatment group and 
treatment-by-visit. Bayesian posterior probability of active treatment arm being superior to placebo 
was calculated. 
The adult study (Study LVGY) was used to build the adult component N (μA, ΣA) of the mixture prior 
distribution. In Study LVGY, a total of 405 patients were randomised equally to placebo, tadalafil 2.5 
mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg. A subset of 216 patients had bosentan as ERA therapy and were similar 
to the patient population in the paediatric study (Study LVHV). The highest 2 doses in the adult study 
were most relevant to the doses, which were studied in the paediatric study (Study LVHV). 
Approximately, 81% of the observed tadalafil area under the concentration versus time curve at steady 
state (AUCss) from Study LVGY predicted following 40 mg QD administration were within the fifth to 
95th percentiles of those estimated following 20 mg. The pooled data from these doses provided an 
estimate of the mean and SE of the treatment difference versus placebo in 6MWD change from 
baseline across the time points. Hence, a subset of 132 patients were the focus of the analyses to form 
the adult component of the mixture prior distribution. 
Diffused prior on the Bayesian MMRM model was used such that the resulting inference for these 
parameters would almost entirely be driven by the observed data in paediatric Study LVHV. This was 
analogous to the primary analysis. The mixture prior approach was also used where diffuse 
independent normal priors were used. This mixture prior approach dynamically and adaptively 
‘borrows’ evidence from adult data from Study LVGY based upon the similarity of the paediatric data

coming from the ongoing Study LVHV using a prespecified weight of 0.8. This weight was determined 
using elicitation from medical experts. To understand the impact of the weight mixture, the model 
using the mixture prior distribution with a weight of 0.5 was examined. 
Table E05 summarises changes from baseline in 6MWD at 24 weeks MMRM (primary analysis for the 
study) result and the Bayesian MMRM results with diffuse prior and mixture prior using weight of 0.5 
and 0.8. The latter model resulted in the posterior mean difference of 27.13 m and 80% credible 
interval (4.94 to 42.73), which supports the positive trend suggested by the primary analysis in Study 
LVHV and indicates that tadalafil treatment improves the 6MWD compared to placebo at Week 24 in 
this paediatric patient population.

The secondary efficacy variables:  
- 
Time to CW and Incidence of CW during Period 1 (Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled) 
In Period 1, 2 subjects, 1 in each treatment group, reported to have potential CWs by Investigators. 
However, since both cases were not confirmed as qualified CWs by Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC), 
these were not used for data analysis. 
• 
• 
One patient (heavy weight) in the placebo group was reported with worsening of PAH due to a 
WHO functional class increase and a 6MWD decrease. This case was not confirmed by the CEC 
because the site did not perform a confirmative 6MW test 5 to 10 days later as described in the 
protocol. 
One patient (heavy weight) in the tadalafil group reported a new-onset syncope as a CW 
event; while the CEC reviewed the case, the investigator revised the event to presyncope 
based upon the clinical information for this patient. Therefore, this was an invalid case based 
upon the CW definition in the protocol for a new-onset syncope. 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 65/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Both subjects discontinued Period 1 study medication and moved into the Period 2 open-label portion 
of the study. It should be noted that both cases of CW were reported as AEs per protocol; however, 
neither subjects were considered withdrawn due to an AE. 
- 
Time to CW and Incidence of CW during Period 2 (Open-Label Extension) 
In Period 2, 5 subjects who had received tadalafil experienced CWs, 1 had new-onset syncope, 2 had 
increase in ERA dose, 1 had addition of new PAH-specific concomitant therapy, and 1 was hospitalised 
for PAH progression. Two CW subjects were in Pla-Tad (placebo in Period 1 and tadalafil in Period 2) 
group (12.5%) and 3 CW subjects in Tad-Tad (tadalafil in both Period 1 and 2) group (18.75%). 
The number of participants with CW was inadequate to perform the statistical analysis for time to CW.  
Additional efficacy variables for period 1: 
The additional efficacy variables for Period 1 were analysis of WHO functional class, echocardiography, 
NT-pro-BNP concentrations, CGI-I and CHQ-PF28. These are briefly described in the following sections. 
WHO Functional Class 
Changes in WHO functional class from baseline to Week 24 for Period 1 is presented in Table E06. 
From baseline to Week 24 (Visit 9) of Period 1, the patients in the tadalafil group had a numerically 
higher and trending to the positive direction of WHO functional class improvement compared with the 
patients in the placebo group. Worsening of WHO functional class was not reported in either group.

Time to CW during Period 1 (Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled). In Period 1, two 
subjects, 1 in each treatment group, reported to have potential CWs by 
Investigators. However, since both cases were not confirmed as qualified CWs 
by Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC), these were not used for data analysis. 
2.6.5.3.  Supportive study 
The  main  supportive  study  (for  effectiveness)  is  the  Japanese  post-marketing  study  (H6D-JE-TD01). 
Among the 391 paediatric patients included (23.3% of the total population), 79 patients were less than 
1 year of age, 163 patients were 1 to 6 years, 110 patients were 7 to 14 years, and 39 patients were 
15 to 18 years. Mean age ± standard deviation (SD) was 5.7 ± 5.34 years, and 51.7% of the patients 
were  boys.  Changes  in  WHO  classification  showed  a  tendency  toward  improvement  at  3  months,  1 
year, 2 years after the start of administration, and final observation in paediatrics was improvement in 
8.6%  (30/348  patients),  16.5%  (40/243  patients),  19.7%  (26/132  patients),  and  16.3%  (57/349 
patients), respectively. The incidence of deterioration in WHO functional class at 3 months, 1 year and 
2 years was 0.6% (2/348 patients), 0.8% (2/243 patients), 1.5% (2/132 patients), and 2.3% (8/349 
patients), respectively. These data support the use of tadalafil in the paediatric population. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
A  single  confirmatory  efficacy  and  safety  study  H6D-MC-LVHV  (LVHV)  has  been  provided  to  support 
the  use  of  Adcirca  in  paediatric  patients  with  PAH.  As  mentioned  above,  other  studies  were  also 
submitted in order to provide supportive clinical data. 
The CHMP considered that the study design and efficacy and safety outcomes/endpoints are acceptable 
for a phase 3, add-on study performed in paediatric subjects with PAH.  
The primary objective of study LVHV Period 1 was to evaluate the efficacy of  tadalafil compared with 
placebo  in  improving  6-minute  walk  distance  (6MWD)  from  baseline  to  Week  24,  as  assessed  in  a 
subset of subjects ≥6 to <18 years of age who were developmentally capable of performing a 6MWD 
test. The 6MWD test is a functional tool who has been validated across several disorders. It should be 
noted  that  in  children  it  has  been  shown  to  have  significant  variability  in  relation  to  several  aspects 
such  as  parental  training  for  6MWT,  patient  willingness  to  outperform  another  attending  child  or 
concomitant medication which may increase or decrease the feeling of fatigue.  
Selected  dose  for  each  paediatric  weight  cohort  reflected  expected  exposures  comparable  to  the 
approved 40 mg dose of tadalafil in adults, based on paediatric PK and safety data from study H6DMC-
LVIG (LVIG) and the PK and safety data from the adult PAH development plan (pivotal study H6D-MC-
LVGY [LVGY]), as reviewed by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) and Sponsor.  
As  presented  in  the  results  section  above,  following  initiation  of  LVHV  study  the  MAH  encountered 
significant study implementation challenges with respect to recruitment of paediatric patients with PAH 
for which SA was sought.  
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 69/101 
 
  
 
 
 
The difficulties in recruitment in study LVHV significantly altered the study design and conduct. Major 
changes were introduced regarding the number of patients enrolled (from 134 to 34) and change of 
primary endpoint from time to first clinical worsening (CW) to improvement in 6MWD from baseline to 
Week 24. CHMP recognises the difficulties associated with using CW as primary endpoint and 
acknowledged the need for change in the primary endpoint. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  the  initial  applied  indication,  the  MAH  claimed  in  the  wording  of  the  indication  that  “Efficacy  in 
patients  ≥  6  years  in  terms  of  improvement  of  exercise  capacity  has  been  shown  in  IPAH  and  PAH 
associated with surgical repair of at least 6-month duration of simple congenital systemic to pulmonary 
shunt”. However, the number of patients with PAH associated with surgical repair is very scarce (only 
2/17  subjects  in  tadalafil  group,  study  LVHV).  The  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  further  efficacy  or 
effectiveness  data  in  this  subgroup,  either  from  other  clinical  trials  or  from  observational  studies  or 
registries  but  was  unable  to  provide  further  data.  As  a  result,  “PAH  associated  with  surgical  repair” 
aetiology was deleted from the proposed wording of the paediatric indication. 
There  were  some  numerical  imbalances  among  baseline  treatment  arms  (Table  E03),  but  the 
imbalance  appears  to  be  conservative  in  the  sense  that  tadalafil  arm  included  older  patients  with 
longer disease duration. 
The majority of subjects (n=25 [71.4%]) were in the heavy-weight cohort with the remainder (n=10 
[28.6%])  in  the  middle-weight  cohort.  Due  to  a  smaller  sample  size  (35  subjects)  than  originally 
planned (134 subjects) in the study, balance of the stratification factors weight cohorts, PAH aetiology 
and type of concomitant ERA were not achieved among the treatment groups. It should be highlighted 
that  there  were  a  lack  of  enrolled  patients  in  the  light-weight  (<25  kg)  cohort  of  study  LVHV  and  a  
lack of clinical data in children < 2 years which limits the ability to establish conclusions on the effect 
of Adcirca in younger patients.  
Regarding the efficacy measures, the change in 6MWD from baseline to the end of period 1 (Week 24) 
in  the  tadalafil  treatment  group  (60.48  meters)  showed  numerically  higher  increase  in  Least-Square 
(LS)  mean  6MWD  at  Week  24  than  placebo  group (36.60  meters),  with  a  placebo-adjusted  LS  mean 
treatment difference of 23.88 meters (80% CI, -14.25, 62.00). Although statistical significance testing 
was not performed between the tadalafil and placebo treatment groups due to the low sample size, a 
positive  trend  can  be  ascertained  in  terms  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint.  Nevertheless,  when  the 
change in 6MWD was also evaluated during the Period 2 (from Period 2 baseline to the end of Period 2 
[Month 24; Visit 17]) as additional efficacy variable, the mean 6MWD decreased by 4.58 meters in the 
Pla-Tad  group  and  32.58  meters  in  Tad-Tad  group.  Mentioned  differences  on  the  improvement  in 
exercise capacity may be due to the difficulties to interpret extension efficacy data where there is no 
control group. Given the known pharmacological effect of tadalafil on retinal function (i.e.: blue-tinted 
vision), the MAH was requested to provide information on whether blinding was truly met or not, i.e. 
whether investigators were asked to comment on their perception of which arm patients were allocated 
to  in  the  period  1  of  the  trial.  The  MAH  clarified  that  unblinding  did  not  occur  until  the  reporting 
database was validated and locked for final statistical analysis on 15 May 2019. Investigators were not 
asked to provide their perception on patient allocation to study arms during the study, and therefore it 
is not possible to fully ascertain that the investigators were not able to distinguish between placebo or 
active  treatment  based  on  patient  symptomatology  (such  as  colour  perception).  The  impact  on  study 
results is, therefore, unknown. 
Regarding the mixed model used for the analysis of 6MWD, the MAH was requested to clarify why at 
week 24, the observed mean change in 6MWD compared to baseline was higher in the patients 
randomised to placebo compared to tadalafil (49.95m versus 37.04m) which implies a mean 
EMA/140777/2023  
Page 70/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
difference of 12,91m to the detriment of tadalafil. However, the overall conclusion is that there is a 
model-based difference of 23.88m in favour of tadalafil. The MAH only explained that the LS mean 
changes came from the model but not why they are completely different from the changes calculated 
with the crude means. Therefore, the appropriateness of the mixed model is still questioned. The MAH 
was also requested to clarify whether the model is appropriate or that the LS mean difference found 
was driven by assumptions rather than the crude measurements, e.g. non-normality of the data or 
outliers (mean and median values tend to differ) implicit MAR imputation (more missingness in 
tadalafil). The MAH clarified that the small difference observed between crude mean change (20.07m) 
and LS mean change (23.88m) is due to the model adjustment for various covariates and factors in 
MMRM (treatment group, visit, baseline 6MWD, and treatment-by-visit interaction). The consistency 
between the crude estimate of the treatment effect and the model adjustment estimate suggested 
that the results from the MMRM model are consistent, appropriate, and valid. 
Regarding safety, it is agreed that the data provided by the MAH do not point toward a different safety 
profile  for  children  <2  years  old.  The  applicant  provided  after  request  the  post-marketing  data 
provided by the MAH (7000 children 0-17 year exposed to Adcirca), divided in the same manner as the 
age groups for AEs, and therefore, the number of AEs relative the exposure could be evaluated and did 
not show any safety concern. The MAH committed to ensure that data on both exposure and AEs will 
be presented divided in age groups in the PSURs. 
Three Bayesian MMRM sensitivity analyses were conducted: Bayesian MMRM analysis with diffuse prior 
and mixture prior using weight of 0.5 and 0.8. The analysis with mixture prior weight 0.8 resulted in 
the  posterior  mean  difference  of  27.13  m  and  80%  credible  interval  (4.94  to  42.73),  which  supports 
the  positive  trend  suggested  by  the  primary  analysis  in  Study  LVHV.  Overall,  the  methods  are 
endorsed  as  sensitivity  analysis  and  no  statistical  conclusions  should  be  made  to  justify  the  results 
since  they  are  very  limited,  mainly  due  to  the  small  sample  size.  Regardless,  the  favourable  trend 
observed in 6MWD (point estimate of 23.88 meters in the main analysis and between 21.14m to 27.13 
m  in  the  Bayesian  MMRM  analyses)  in  study  LVHV  is  considered  to  be  of  clinical  relevance  and  is 
consistent with the 26 metres improvement observed in adults with tadalafil 40 mg (placebo-adjusted 
median increase in 6MWD). In order to further explore the clinical relevance of these results, the MAH 
was requested to conduct an ad-hoc analysis of responders, defined as an improvement by at least 20 
metres at week 24 compared with baseline values. The trend for responders is in favour of tadalafil (10 
vs  8;  OR  =  1.75;  95%CI:  0.40  to  7.66),  where  responders  are  defined  as  subjects  with  6MWD 
improvement of at least 20 metres from baseline at Week 24. However, the analysis is limited by the 
small  sample  size.  The  magnitude  of  response  was  not  different  between  treatment  and  placebo 
responders.  In  an  ultra-rare  disorder,  it  is  considered  to  be  more  relevant  to  know  which  were  the 
causes  of  individual  behaviour  for  the  different  endpoints  during  period  1.  As  such,  the  MAH  was 
requested to provide a by-subject waterfall figure to help clarifying these findings. By-subject waterfall 
plot  for  6MWD  shows  that  only  one  patient  on  tadalafil  and  six  patients  on  placebo  experienced  a 
worsening  in  6MWD  from baseline to  week  24.  Therefore,  the  tadalafil  improvement  in  6MWD  versus 
placebo is a mix of improvement in all but one patient in the tadalafil group, coupled with a worsening 
in 6MWD in almost half of patients in the placebo group.

Subject ID
Clinical worsening cases were only recorded in five subjects who received tadalafil during the Period 2 
of  the  study  LVHV  (1  new-onset  syncope,  2  increase  in  ERA  dose,  1  addition  of  new  PAH-specific 
concomitant  therapy,  and  1  hospitalization  for  PAH  progression).  Any  interpretation  of  these  results 
both in Period and in Period 2 periods deems to be hampered by the low number of subjects included 
in  the  study.  Therefore,  study  LVHV  was  considered  as  supportive  of  the  efficacy  of  tadalafil  in 
children.  Approval  of  the  indication  in  children  was  mainly  based  on  an  extrapolation  exercise  of  the 
efficacy  from  adults  showing  similar  exposure  using  PK/PD  data  analyses  (see  clinical  pharmacology 
section).  
The  positive  trend  of  potential  efficacy  of  tadalafil  versus  placebo  observed  in  the  6MWD  as  primary 
efficacy endpoint, seems to be supported by the majority of the additional efficacy measurements. All 
subtest  domains  and  summary  score  on  physical  and  psychological  dimensions  in  CHQ-PF28  did  not 
show a difference between tadalafil and placebo treatment group, with the exception of Global Health 
(treatment difference 7.26, 95% CI, -9.25 to 23.77). 
The  main  supportive  study  (for  effectiveness)  is  the  Japanese  post-marketing  study  (H6D-JE-TD01). 
The results obtained from this study further support the efficacy and safety data seen from the main 
trial. 
In children younger than age 6 years, efficacy has been extrapolated based upon exposure-matching 
to  the  adult  efficacious  dose  range.  This  is  mainly  due  to  limited  availability  of  pharmacodynamic 
measures and lack of a suitable and approved clinical endpoint.  
The MAH reviewed the disease course, response, and the PK/PD-relationships. It was agreed that the 
disease course in children less than 6 years is very similar to adults and, therefore, it can be expected 
a similar response based upon PK/PD relationships and exposure-matching. Extrapolation from adults 
based on exposure matching can be accepted.

Additionally,  the  applicant  provided  long-term  effectiveness  and  safety  data  available  from  the 
Japanese PMS TD01 that included 50 children aged < 6 months and 70 children aged 6 months to 2 
years old , 105 children aged ≥2 to less than 6 years and 166 children aged ≥ 6 years, for a total of 
391 children . The observation period extended up to a maximum of 2 years. The number of children 
in study TD01 is considered quite relevant for this submission. The data available in children between 
6  months  and  2  years  of  age  from  study  TD01  show  similar  changes  in  WHO  FC  compared  to older 
children.  It  is  reassuring  that  no  children  between  6  months  and  6  years  experienced  worsening  in 
WHO  FC.  In  addition,  survival  rate  in  children  aged  6  months  to  <  2  years  was  quite  high:  97.6% 
(95%CI: 83.9 to 99.7) at one year and 93.1% (95%CI: 73.8 to 98.3) at 2 years. There were other 
positive trends regarding a numerical decrease from baseline in PAP, PVRI and TRPG, and an increase 
in cardiac index from baseline at all time points. Safety profile in children aged 6 months to 6 years 
was similar to that reported in the overall paediatric population of study TD01 (n = 391) (refer also to 
safety section of this report). 
The applicant was also asked to send a text proposal for describing study TD01 in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC, but considering study limitations (single cohort, not randomisation by age or treatment group, 
presence of confounding factors like concomitant medications or other drugs for PAH, limited number 
of paediatric patients with pulmonary haemodynamic values and 6MW data only collected for paediatric 
patients capable of performing the 6MW test), the company did not propose to include study TD01 in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC, which is agreed.  
It should be highlighted that most of the data in support of the use of Adcirca in the younger children 
i.e. under 2 years old comes from study TD01. However, this study presents some clear limitations 
(single cohort, no randomisation, presence of confounding factors like concomitant medications or 
other drugs for PAH, limited number of paediatric patients with pulmonary haemodynamic values and 
6MW data only collected for paediatric patients capable of performing the 6MW test). No additional 
efficacy or effectiveness data in these subgroups for paediatric PAH patients was available. There was 
also no concordance between the doses used in study TD01 and the proposed doses to be 
administered in the younger patients. 
Further refinement of the PBPK model was needed to provide a proposed dosing regimen where the 
exposure in paediatric patients match the adult exposures for which efficacy and safety has been 
established. The CHMP considered that despite the improvements introduced in the model insufficient 
clarifications were provided and important doubts still remained about the predictive capacity of the 
PBPK model to be able to establish a dose recommendation in population groups where there is no 
experimental evidence. Considering all the uncertainties above, it was not possible for CHMP to 
establish an efficacious and safe posology in children aged 6 months to < 2 years without the 
availability of some clinical PK data in this age subset. In addition, the lack of a PK study to assess the 
food effect was considered a major issue for establishing the posology in younger children. All these 
outstanding issues prevented from including children < 2 years in the indication. However, the CHMP 
considered that the available efficacy data allows to support the use of Adcirca in the treatment of PAH 
for children aged 2 years and older. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A total of 51 paediatric patients aged from 2.5 to 17 years with PAH were treated with tadalafil in 
clinical trials (H6D-MC-LVHV, H6D-MC-LVIG). A total of 391 Japanese paediatric patients with PAH, 
from new-born to < 18 years, were treated with tadalafil in an observational post-marketing study 
(H6D-JE-TD01).  
EMA/140777/2023 
Page 73/101 
 
 
  
 
The main efficacy data of tadalafil in children with PAH was obtained from study LVHV which included 
35 patients aged 6.2 to 17.9 years (median age of 14.2 years), coupled with a extrapolation exercise 
from adults (Bayesian MMRM sensitivity analysis).  
In study LVHV, a total of 17 patients were treated once daily with ADCIRCA 20 mg (middle-weight 
cohort, ≥ 25 kg to < 40 kg) or 40 mg (heavy-weight cohort, ≥ 40 kg), and 18 patients were treated 
with placebo, for 24 weeks. 
Regarding the efficacy measures, the change in 6MWD from baseline to the end of period 1 (Week 
24) in the tadalafil treatment group (60.48 meters) showed numerically higher increase in Least-
Square (LS) mean 6MWD at Week 24 than placebo group (36.60 meters), with a placebo-adjusted LS 
mean treatment difference of 23.88 meters (80% CI, -14.25, 62.00). Although statistical significance 
testing was not performed between the tadalafil and placebo treatment groups due to the low sample 
size, a positive trend can be ascertained in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The positive trend of potential efficacy of tadalafil versus placebo observed in the 6MWD as primary 
efficacy endpoint, seems to be supported by the majority of the additional efficacy measurements. 
In children younger than age 6 years, efficacy has been extrapolated based upon exposure-matching 
to the adult efficacious dose range. It is agreed by CHMP that the disease course in children less than 
6 years is very similar to adults and, therefore, it can be expected a similar response based upon 
PK/PD relationships and exposure-matching. Extrapolation from adults based on exposure matching 
can therefore be accepted. 
However, for children under 2 years old most of the data in support of the use of Adcirca in the 
younger children comes from study TD01 which has several limitations. Considering all the 
uncertainties highlighted in the discussion above, it was not possible for CHMP to establish an 
efficacious and safe posology in children aged 6 months to < 2 years without the availability of some 
clinical PK data in this age subset. In addition, the lack of a PK study to assess the food effect was 
considered a major issue for establishing the posology in younger children. All these outstanding issues 
prevented from including children < 2 years in the indication. However, the CHMP considered that the 
available efficacy data allows to support the use of Adcirca in the treatment of PAH for children aged 2 
years and older. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The primary safety analysis presented in this application is based upon Period 1 of Study LVHV, a 
randomised, Phase 3, 2-period, add-on (i.e., in addition to the patient’s current endothelin receptor 
antagonist [ERA]) study.  
Supportive safety data from 3 additional studies are also presented. 
•  Study LVHV – Period 2 – open-label extension (OLE). 
•  Study LVIG – a clinical pharmacology multiple ascending dose study that assessed the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety in a paediatric population with PAH. 
•  Study TD01 – a post-marketing observational study that enrolled adult and paediatric patients 
with PAH who received tadalafil. The maximum duration of the observational period was 2 
years.

Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population 
Demographic and baseline patient characteristics for randomised patients are summarised below. 
Study LVHV 
Period 1 
There were 16 male and 19 female patients in this study; the median age for the overall population 
was 14.2 years (ranged from 6.2 to 17.9 years) and 37.1% patients were less than 12 years of age. 
No patient was enrolled younger than 6 years in the study (in other words, there were no light-weight 
cohort patients enrolled). 
The majority of patients were white (26 [74.3%]) and 7 (20%) of total enrolled patients were from 
sites in Europe (Germany, France, Poland) and Turkey. 
PAH aetiologies were predominantly idiopathic PAH (74.3%: 61.1% on the placebo group and 88.2% 
on the tadalafil group) and PAH associated with persisting or recurrent pulmonary hypertension (PH) 
after repair of a congenital systemic to pulmonary shunt (25.7%; 38.9% on the placebo group and 
11.8% on tadalafil group). The majority of patients were in WHO functional class II (80%). 
The majority of patients (25 [71.4%]) were in the heavy-weight cohort with the remainder (10 
[28.6%]) in the middle-weight cohort. 
Baseline clinical and disease characteristics for the Primary Analysis and 6MW Populations included the 
same patients and were therefore identical, as all patients in the primary analysis population were able 
to provide 6MW data. The majority of patients (94.1%) were taking bosentan as concomitant ERA. 
Period 2 
There were 14 male and 18 female patients who continued to Period 2; the median age for the overall 
population was 14.4 years (ranged from 6.2 to 17.9 years). The majority of patients were white 24 
(75%) and 7 (21.9%) were from Europe. The majority of patients (23 [71.9%]) were in the heavy-
weight group with the remainder (9 [28.1%]) in the middle-weight group. Pulmonary arterial 
hypertension aetiologies were predominantly idiopathic PAH (n=25; 78.1%) and PAH associated with 
persisting or recurrent PH after repair of a congenital systemic to pulmonary shunt (n=7; 21.9%); the 
majority of patients had WHO functional class II (n=25; 78.1%). 
Study LVIG 
Nineteen paediatric patients with PAH, 6 male and 13 female, aged 2.5 to 17 years at the time of 
enrolment participated in Period 1. One patient in the middle-weight cohort was 17 years, 11.5 months 
at the time of enrolment. Twelve of the 19 patients (63%) were enrolled from Europe (France, United 
Kingdom, Poland, and Spain). 
EMA/140777/2023 
Page 77/101 
 
 
  
 
 
Eighteen of the 19 patients who enrolled and completed Period 1 of the study were enrolled in Period 
2. One patient was terminated early from the study during Period 1 (after Visit 7, Week 6) due to not 
meeting the required hemodynamic inclusion criterion. 
Dose and duration of exposure 
In Period 1 of Study LVHV, tadalafil QD dose was 40 mg for the heavy-weight cohort and 20 mg for the 
middle-weight cohort. In total, 17 patients received tadalafil and 18 patients received placebo during 
Period 1. The mean and median cumulative number of doses taken during Period 1 was 151.0 and 
161.0 (range 43.0 to 188.0) for tadalafil and 153.4 and 165.0 (range 27.0 to 188.0) for placebo. The 
mean days of exposure for Period 1 was 170.4 (SD =16.00) for tadalafil and 158.4 (SD = 39.49) for 
placebo. 
In Period 2, all patients (32) received tadalafil QD dose of 20 mg in middle-weight cohort and 40 mg in 
heavy-weight cohort. The mean and median cumulative number of tadalafil doses taken during Period 
2 in Tad-Tad group were 597.9 and 679.5 (range 101.5 to 746.5) and in Pla-Tad group were 664.5 and 
685.3 (range 476.0 to 747.0). The mean days of exposure for Period 2 was 656.0 (SD =187.19) for 
Tad-Tad group and 708.6 (SD = 78.97) for Pla-Tad group. Overall, 26 patients completed the 24-
month follow-up. 
In Study LVIG, the mean days of exposure to tadalafil were similar across weight cohorts for Period 1 
(70.67, 66.14 and 69.67 days for the light-, medium- and heavy-weight cohorts, respectively). Overall 
mean days of exposure to tadalafil were similar across weight cohorts (761.17, 673.29 and 659.00 
days for the light-, middle- and heavy-weight cohorts, respectively). 
In Study LVJJ of the 331 randomized patients, 330 received a dose of study medication. The overall 
mean age was 9.6 years and the majority of patients were white (79.2%). Mean duration of exposure 
was 333.3 days in the placebo group, 335.9 days in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group, and 330.2 days in 
the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group. In the open-label analysis set, mean exposure duration during the OLE 
period was 244.1 days in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group and 233.5 days in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg 
group. The patients were also receiving corticosteroids throughout the study and 96.4% received ≥ 1 
concomitant medication in addition to corticosteroids. 
In the observational Study TD01, the maximum exposure was 2 years.

  Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
There were 23 subjects who reported at least 1 TEAE, (8/18) (44.4%) subjects in the placebo 
group and 15/17 (88.2%) subjects in the tadalafil group reported at least 1 TEAE during Period 
1. The most common TEAEs, occurring in ≥2 patients in tadalafil-treated patients, were 
headache (29.4%, tadalafil; 11.1%, placebo), upper respiratory tract infection (17.6%, 
tadalafil; 5.6%, placebo), influenza (17.6%, tadalafil; 0.0%, placebo), arthralgia (11.8%, 
tadalafil; 5.6%, placebo), and epistaxis (11.8%, tadalafil; 5.6%, placebo). All of the AEs in the 
tadalafil group were mild or moderate in severity.

adverse event. 
  Note: Percentages are based on the number of patients in each cohort. Patients are counted once in each category; events are counted once for 
each unique SOC, preferred term, onset date, and patient. Period 1 TEAE is defined as period 1 AE that first occurred or worsened (increased 
in severity) after first dose of study drug in Period 1. Period 2 TEAE is defined as Period 2 AE that first occurred or worsened (increased in 
severity) after first dose of study drug in Period 2.  
a Overall TEAE includes AE during the course of study that first occurred or worsened (increased in severity) after first dose of study drug in 
Period 1. 
  Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
During period 1he most frequent TEAE was pyrexia. During Period 2, the most frequent TEAEs 
(occurring in >2 patients) were headache, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, angina 
pectoris, and PAH.  
  Treatment-Related Adverse Events 
Headache was the most commonly reported TEAE considered by the investigator to be possibly 
related to tadalafil. During period 1 pain in extremity, swelling of eyelid, swelling face, 
urticaria, constipation, faeces soft, abdominal pain, pruritus, rash, and vasodilation were 
reported as TEAEs considered related by the investigator. Abdominal pain, rash, and decreased 
appetite were reported during Period 2. 
3) Study LVJJ 
In  the  double-blind  period,  there  were  no  significant  differences  between  the  tadalafil  0.3  mg/kg 
group  and  placebo  or  between  the  tadalafil  0.6  mg/kg  group  and  placebo  in  the  proportion  of 
patients  who  reported  ≥1  SAE,  TEAE,  study  disease-related  AE,  procedure-related  AE,  adjunctive 
treatment-related  AE  (i.e.,  corticosteroid  therapy),  or  who  discontinued  due  to  AE.  There  was  a 
significant  difference  between  the  tadalafil  0.6  mg/kg  group  and  placebo  in  the  proportion  of 
patients  who  experienced  ≥1  AE  considered  possibly  related  to  study  drug  by  the  investigator 
(59.8%  versus  41.4%;  p=.006).  In  the  OLE,  the  proportion  of  patients  reporting  ≥1  TEAE  was 
56.0% in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group and 61.2% in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group. Adverse events 
considered to be related to study drug by the investigator were reported in 11.3% of patients in the 
tadalafil  0.3  mg/kg  group  and  13.3%  of  patients  in  the  tadalafil  0.6  mg/kg  group.  Approximately, 
one-fourth  of  patients  reported  AEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  disease 
(26.7% of patients in each group) and 6.7% had AEs assessed by the investigator as being related 
to corticosteroid therapy (3.3% tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg; 9.7% tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg).

The overall safety profile in Study LVJJ was generally consistent with the known safety profile of 
tadalafil and the paediatric DMD study population receiving corticosteroids  
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
  Deaths (Study LVHV, LVIG and LVJJ) 
No  deaths  were  reported  in  the  Study  LVHV  (Period  1  or  Period  2).  In  Study  LVIG,  there  were  2 
deaths, both in Period 2. Neither death was related to tadalafil as judged by the investigator (in the 
first  case  the  cause  of  death  was  reported  as  postoperative  cardiac  arrest  after  a  Potts  shunt 
procedure and the second patient died due to cardiac failure). No deaths were reported in Study LVJJ. 
  Serious Adverse Events 
1) Study LVHV 
a) Period 1 (Double-Blind Treatment) 
There were no SAEs in Period 1 of LVHV. 
b) Period 2 (Open-Label Treatment Period) 
A total of 5 patients experienced ≥1 SAE (4 patients in the Pla-Tad group and 1 patient in the Tad-Tad 
group). None of them were considered to be related to tadalafil as judged by the investigator.

2) Study LVIG 
Overall,  8  patients  experienced  SAEs  (2  [10.53%]  in  Period  1,  and  7  [38.89%]  in  Period  2).  Two 
patients  experienced  SAEs  of  viral  infection  in  Period  1.  The  remaining  SAEs  (cardiac  failure, 
gastritis,  pyrexia,  Type  1  diabetes  mellitus,  febrile  convulsion,  presyncope,  seizure,  and  ovarian 
cyst) were reported during Period 2. One patient had multiple SAEs during study Period 1 and Period 
2. None of the SAEs in this study were considered related to tadalafil or study procedures.  
3) Study LVJJ 
During the double-blind treatment period, fifteen patients (4.5%) reported ≥1 SAE. The proportion 
of patients reporting ≥1 SAE was not significantly different between either of the tadalafil treatment 
groups and placebo. The most common SAEs reported in the study were fall (n=3), femur fracture

(n=2), and tendinous contracture (n=2). During the OLE, 6 patients in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group 
reported  a  total  of  7  SAEs  and  9 patients  in  the  tadalafil  0.6  mg/kg  group  reported  a  total  of  12 
SAEs. Across both tadalafil treatment groups, fall and femur fracture were the only individual SAEs 
reported by more than 1 patient during the OLE (2 patients each). 
  Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The AESIs included in this submission (hypotension, priapism, hearing abnormality, visual abnormality 
and uterine haemorrhage) were selected based upon PDE5 inhibitors class risks, on known risks for 
tadalafil use in adults (including the potential and important risks included in the EU Risk Management 
Plan [RMP]) and on additional topics of interest to the PDCO regarding PAH (described in the PIP). 
In Study LVHV (Periods 1 and 2), 6 patients reported AESIs.  
During Period 1, there was 1 moderate hypotension that did not lead to treatment discontinuation and 
resolved, while tadalafil treatment continued. This event was considered a treatment-related AE by the 
investigator. Seven other AEs possibly related to hypotension (dizziness, presyncope, syncope, loss of 
consciousness) were reported in 7 patients. However, of all of these AEs, 5 were considered to be 
related to PAH or CW by the study investigator. In the OLE period (Period 2), 2 of the dizziness events 
were considered treatment-related but no hypotension or decrease in BP were reported. The review of 
these 7 cases did not conclude these were hypotension-related events. No hypotension events 
occurred in Period 2. 
Uterine bleeding was described in 4 patients (6 events) receiving tadalafil. One patient in the tadalafil 
group from Period 1 experienced uterine bleeding and 4 patients experienced 5 events of uterine 
bleeding in Period 2; 2 patients in Pla-Tad group and 2 patients in Tad-Tad group. Three events were 
mild, 2 events were moderate and 1 event was serious needing a blood transfusion (this case was 
considered a treatment-related AE). All cases of uterine bleeding resolved while patients remained on 
study medication.  
In Period 2, one case of mild visual abnormality was reported 80 days after the onset of dosing; the 
event resolved the same day. The event was not considered to be related to tadalafil as judged by the 
investigator. 
There were no patients with priapism. Two patients experienced spontaneous intermittent penile 
erections (1 on tadalafil group during Period 1 and 1 on Pla-Tad group during Period 2) that resolved 
spontaneously. No hearing abnormalities were reported in the study.  
In Study LVIG (Period 1 and 2), there was 1 mild orthostatic hypotension not considered treatment-
related AE that recovered on the same day. Other AEs possibly related to hypotension (dizziness, 
presyncope, syncope and loss of consciousness) were reported in 5 patients, all considered to be 
related to PAH. None of them were classified as treatment-related AEs. The review of these 5 cases did 
not conclude these were hypotension-related events. 
In addition, there was 1 mild uterine bleeding not considered treatment-related AE that recovered 
without treatment and 1 moderate visual abnormality not considered treatment-related AE that 
recovered in the same day. No hearing abnormalities or priaprism were reported. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
1)  Study LVHV 
-Clinical Laboratory Evaluations during Period 1 (Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled): 
EMA/140777/2023 
Page 84/101 
 
 
  
 
Safety laboratory tests (including chemistry, hematology, coagulation and urinalysis) were performed 
during Period 1 of the study only. There were no clinically relevant mean changes from baseline to end 
of study (Period 1) in laboratory parameters in both placebo and tadalafil treatment groups. 
No patients in the tadalafil and placebo group met the criteria of having an aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) more than 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) and 
having a total bilirubin more than 1.5-fold the ULN postbaseline.   
A total of 9 patients (3 on tadalafil and 6 on placebo), and 3 patients (2 on tadalafil and 1 on placebo) 
had shifts from normal to abnormal range in urine protein and blood occult, respectively. One patient 
on placebo had glucose present in urine at the end of the study.    
- Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
 The following key findings for Period 1 and Period 2 were observed: 
• 
The mean and median change in weight was ≤1 kg in both treatment groups at the endpoint of 
Period 1. The mean increase in height at the endpoint of Period 1 was approximately 0.75 cm 
difference between the 2 treatment groups.   
•  During Period 2, mean (median) weight increases from baseline (last non-missing value before 
or at Visit 2) to endpoint (Visit 17) in all patients were 5.73 (4.95) kg and 5.16 (3.10) kg in the 
Pla-Tad and Tad-Tad groups, respectively. In change from baseline, there was a difference of 
3.71 cm in mean increase in height at the endpoint of Period 2 between the 2 treatment 
groups. The difference could be partially due to difference in age-related growth curve 
expectations and gender differences between the groups, i.e., more male patients in the Pla-
Tad group (n=8, 50%) compared to Tad-Tad group (n=6, 37.5%). 
•  Mean decreases from baseline in supine systolic blood pressure of ≤3.00 mm Hg and median 
changes from 0 to -3.00 mm Hg were observed in the placebo group. In the tadalafil group, 
mean increases in supine systolic blood pressure ranging from 0.35 to 7.07 mm Hg and 
median increases no larger than 5.00 mm Hg were observed throughout Period 1. 
•  Mean and median increases or decreases from baseline in supine diastolic blood pressure no 
larger in magnitude than 3.00 mm Hg were observed in the placebo group. In the tadalafil 
group, mean increases no larger than 1.20 mm Hg and median changes ranging from 0 to 1.00 
mm Hg were observed.   
• 
The mean and median increases in supine HR no larger than 4 bpm were observed in the 
placebo group whereas mean increases or decreases no larger in magnitude than 
approximately 6 bpm were observed in the tadalafil group. 
•  During Period 1, all 15 subjects in the placebo group had normal right and left eye results at 
Week 24, including 2 subjects who had an abnormal not clinically significant (NCS) result at 
baseline. 
•  Out of 13 subjects in the tadalafil group, 12 had normal results at baseline and at Week 24, 
and the remaining 1 subject with normal baseline had an abnormal NCS result in both the right 
and left eyes at Week 24, and had a normal examination at Year 2 (Visit 17). 
• 
• 
There were no AEs related to ECG findings observed in the study. 
There were no clinically significant trends observed from inhibin B, Tanner score, and IQ 
testing evaluations based on the available data.   
EMA/140777/2023 
Page 85/101 
 
 
  
•  No clinical information of relevance was provided as regards of intellectual ability and cognitive 
function assessments since the submitted summary statistics were based on only 1 to 4 
subjects aged ≥6 years 0 months to 16 years 11 months. 
2)  Study LVIG 
There were neither patterns nor trends in clinical laboratory evaluations, vital sign measurements or 
electrocardiogram readings indicating adverse effects related to tadalafil treatment in the Study LVIG. 
Inhibin B was monitored in male patients only. A baseline sample was collected on Day 1 of Period 1 
and at Years 1 and 2 of Period 2. Inhibin B values increased over time compared to baseline values in 
male patients both <9 and ≥9 years of age indicating normal testicular function. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors such as different age groups (in adults), gender and renal impairment are described in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).  
Ethnical differences were evaluated comparing Japanese and non-Japanese data from adult PAH Study 
LVIG. Japanese subset showed similar trends in efficacy and safety to the whole population. There is 
no scientific evidence to support that Japanese paediatric patients are different enough that safety data 
are not informative to clinicians.  
The Study LVIG divided patients by different weight subgroups, but the groups did not differ in safety 
profile.

2.6.8.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
With the exception of Studies LVHV and LVIG, all drug interaction studies have been conducted in 
adults for the original marketing application. 
Based on the adult drug-drug interaction studies, nitrates are contraindicated in patients taking 
tadalafil due to risk of hypotension. In patients, who are taking alpha blockers, concomitant 
administration of tadalafil may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some patients. The combination of 
tadalafil and doxazosin is not recommended. There are no known interactions of tadalafil with other 
medications.

2.6.8.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study LVH 
a) Period 1(Double-Blind Treatment) (Primary safety analysis) 
There were no discontinuations due to AEs in Period 1 of LVHV. Two patients were initially 
discontinued in Period 1 of Study LVHV due to events of clinical worsening (CW) reported by 
principal investigator (as per protocol); however, the events were later adjudicated by the 
Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC) as they were not considered CW, and the patients continued 
in Period 2. 
b) Period 2 (Open-Label Treatment Period) 
One subject discontinued due to an AE (headache) in the Tad-Tad group. This 17.5-year-old 
white female received the first dose of tadalafil (40 mg) in Period 2. The subject had idiopathic 
PAH and received concomitant bosentan. On day 275 of Period 2, the patient experienced 
dizziness, decreased exercise tolerance, headache; all of moderate severity. All events were 
reported as resolved on Day 72 after onset of the events. 
2) Study LVIG 
There were no patient discontinuations due to AEs in any weight cohort in any Period. 
3) Study LVJJ:   
In Study LVJJ, during the double-blind Period, 5 patients (1.5%) discontinued because of an 
AE:  2  patients  in  the  placebo  group,  2  patients  in  the  tadalafil  0.3  mg/kg  group  (adverse 
events of epistaxis and myocarditis), and 1 patient in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (adverse 
event of urticaria). One patient discontinued from the OLE because of a TEAE of dysesthesia 
that was mild in severity. 
2.6.8.8.  Post marketing experience 
As of 30 September 2020, approximately 84.6 million patients worldwide have been exposed to 
tadalafil. Adcirca data is based upon age and gender distribution data from the MarketScan database. 
Reviews of this off-label use in paediatrics have been provided in previous PSURs and no new signals 
were identified. 
Cumulatively  throughout  15  October  2020,  Lilly’s  safety  database  captured  1147  AEs  from  423 
paediatric postmarketing reports (<18 years old). Of these 423 cases, 225 (53.2%) were female, 188 
(44.4%) were male and the gender was unknown in 10 cases (2.4%).  
The majority of reported cases were between 2- and 18-years old.

Of  these  cases,  253  (59.8%)  were  spontaneous  reports,  154  (36.4%)  from  noninterventional 
postmarketing  studies  (136  AEs  and  SAEs  from  Study  TD01),  9  (2.1%)  from literature  and  7  (1.7%) 
from regulatory authority. Regarding seriousness, 150 cases were reported as SAEs (35.5%) and 273 
were reported as nonserious (64.5%). In total, 29 cases (6.9%) had fatal outcome. 
The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  PH,  pneumonia,  PAH,  syncope,  hypotension  and  cardiac 
failure,  most  of  them  are  related  to  PAH’s  symptoms.  Of  the  29  cases  with  fatal  outcome,  16  were 
from Study TD01 (described below). Of the remaining 13 cases, 7 cases were reported by health care 
providers (HCPs), 2 were from literature and 4 were reported by consumers. Of the 7 cases reported 
by HCPs, in 3 the event was considered not related to tadalafil, in 3 the relatedness assessment was 
not  provided  and  in  1  case  the  nurse  considered  the  event  possibly  related  to  tadalafil.  The  2  cases 
from  literature  suspected  of  tadalafil  relatedness  (1  suicide  case  and  1  PAH  case  with  clinical 
worsening). 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The data presented show a consistent safety profile with the already known safety profile of tadalafil in 
adult patients with PAH. Data from LVHV and LVIG, conducted as a part of the PIP, do not raise any 
major safety concern and neither appears to emerge from the post-marketing data provided, which 
can be considered supportive to data from clinical trials. 
There is a limited sample size included in clinical trials (51 PAH patients treated with tadalafil). 
Although, it is accepted that due the rarity of the disease, the safety database may be quite limited, 
some limitations regarding the provided sample size were considered relevant:  
There is a lack of controlled data from patients <6 years and only data from 17 patients aged >6 years 
are controlled. The observational Study TD01 is the only study that provides safety data in patients <2 
years old, while safety data for patients ≥2 years and <6 years also comes from study TD01 and the 
open label of Phase 1b/2 LVIG Study. Although data initially provided did not suggest a worse safety 
profile in the lower age-subset of patients, robustness of such data were limited. 
To achieve a more detailed and comparative view of the safety profile of tadalafil by age subgroup, the 
MAH was requested to provide a summary of all safety data available in children <6 years and <2 
years, to discuss about potential safety issues and to comment on the need to ensure the collection of 
post-marketing data in these age subsets.  
In this regard, the MAH has provided the analysis of safety data by age subgroups from studies TD01 
and LVIG, as well as from post-marketing reports (including literature). 
The overall number of children aged <2 years (n=120; all from study TD01), and ≥2 to <6 years 
(n=109; of them 105 from study TD01 and 4 from study LVIG) are considered quite relevant for this 
submission given the rarity of the disease. In this population, the safety profile of tadalafil appears 
manageable and similar irrespective of children-age. Reported adverse events were not unexpected for 
PAH patients. Supportive safety data from pharmacovigilance (as of September 2021; 7000 peadiatric 
patients exposed) and literature do not suggest a different trend. 
Nonetheless, inherent limitations to Study TD01 (observational nature, uncontrolled design, 
confounding factors) and to Study LVIG (uncontrolled design and limited subgroup’s sample size) 
should not be overlooked and, therefore, it is acknowledged that a robust conclusion on safety results 
cannot be drawn. 
EMA/140777/2023 
Page 89/101 
 
 
  
On the other hand, it is acknowledged that recruitment challenges may affect the collection of post-
marketing data by means of a new clinical trial in these lower-age patients. Despite of this fact, the 
MAH will continue to review all paediatric events through routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
In summary, CHMP considers that, despite of known limitations, including the rarity of the disease, all 
the evidence provided suggest that safety is similar in all age groups. and that the safety profile in 
younger children is acceptable. No further measures are considered to be needed in this younger 
population in terms of safety. 
Main long-term data come from the 32 patients who entered the 24-month long-term OLE period 
(Period 2 of Study LVHV) of which 26 patients completed it. Additional data from the 18 patients from 
Period 2 of Study LVIG (2 years) were available, in conjunction with supportive Japanese patients from 
observational study (H6D-JE-TD01) which also provides data up to 2 years. No new long-term safety 
concerns were observed either. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The primary safety analysis is based on the doubled blind period of Study LVHV (n=17 tadalafil treated 
patients), which can be considered as the ‘pivotal’ trial within this submission. From its results, it can 
be concluded that tadalafil was well-tolerated in paediatric population > 6 years. Overall, the AEs in 
this trial were similar to those observed in the pivotal trials in adult PAH patients and are consistent 
with the safety profile of tadalafil and AEs expected in this patient population. There were no deaths or 
SAEs and there were no discontinuations due to AEs. The most frequently reported AE were headache. 
Data presented from PAH paediatric patients show a consistent safety profile with the already known 
safety profile of tadalafil in adults with PAH. Data from LVHV and LVIG (51 patients treated with 
tadalafil), conducted as a part of the PIP, do not raise any major safety concern and neither appears to 
emerge from the post-marketing data provided, which can be considered as supportive to data from 
clinical trials. 
Supportive safety data in PAH (32 patients from the OLE period of Study LVHV, 19 from Study LVIG 
and 391 from the observational study TD01) are generally consistent with the data observed from 
LVHV study. Data from Study LVJJ in DMD paediatric patients treated with tadalafil can be also 
considered as supportive evidence. 
Although, it is accepted that due the rarity of the disease, the safety database may be quite limited, 
some limitations regarding the provided sample size should be highlighted. Specially, that there is a 
lack of controlled data from patients < 6 years and only data from 17 patients aged > 6 years are 
controlled. The observational Study TD01 is the only study that provides safety data in patients <2 
years old, while safety data for patients ≥2 years and <6 years also comes from study TD01 and the 
open label of Phase 1b/2 LVIG Study.  
Nevertheless, the overall number of children aged < 2 years (n=120; all from study TD01), and ≥2 to 
<6 years (n= 109; of them 105 from study TD01 and 4 from study LVIG) are considered quite relevant 
for this submission given the rarity of the disease. In this population, safety profile of tadalafil appears 
manageable and similar irrespective of children-age. Reported adverse events were not unexpected for 
PAH patients. Supportive safety data from pharmacovigilance (7000 paediatric patients exposed) and 
literature do not suggest a different trend. Regarding the post-marketing data (7000 children 0-17 
year exposed to Adcirca), the MAH was requested to divide exposure in the same manner as the age 
groups for AEs, to be able to evaluate the amount of AEs relative to the exposure. The MAH provided 
this information and also committed to present data on both exposure and AEs divided in age groups in 
the PSURs.

Nonetheless, inherent limitations to Study TD01 (observational nature, uncontrolled design, 
confounding factors) and to Study LVIG (uncontrolled design and limited subgroup’s sample size) 
should be not be overlooked and, therefore, it is acknowledged that a robust conclusion about safety 
results cannot be drawn. 
On the other hand, it is acknowledged that recruitment challenges may affect the collection of post-
marketing data by means of a new clinical trial in these lower-age patients. Despite of this fact, the 
MAH will continue to review all paediatric events through routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
Thus, even taking into account the limitations with the safety database including the rarity of the 
disease, all the evidence provided suggest that safety is similar in all age groups. Overall, the data 
provided allows to conclude that the safety profile in younger children is acceptable. No further 
measures are considered to be needed in this younger population in terms of safety. Long-term safety 
data, which includes data up to 2 years, do not show a relevant difference with safety in the short 
term.  
Overall, the totality of the clinical safety data currently available, suggests that tadalafil has an 
acceptable safety profile in the paediatric population. The AE profile, including the types and incidence 
of adverse events, were similar to the adult studies presented in the original marketing application.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) submited an application for Adcirca (tadalafil) for the 
following proposed new indication for paediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) specifically: 
“Treatment of paediatric patients aged 6 months to 17 years old with PAH classified as WHO functional 
class II and III. Efficacy in patients ≥ 6 years in terms of improvement of exercise capacity has been 
shown in IPAH and PAH associated with surgical repair of at least 6-month duration of simple 
congenital systemic to pulmonary shunt.” 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive, highly debilitating disease characterised 
by vascular obstruction and the variable presence of vasoconstriction, leading to increased pulmonary 
vascular resistance (PVR) and right-sided heart failure. If left untreated, PAH ultimately leads to right 
ventricular failure and death.  
Paediatric PAH is a rare and complex condition associated with diverse cardiac, pulmonary, and 
systemic diseases, with significant morbidity and mortality. It shares some similarities with adult PAH, 
but there are important known differences in vascular function, foetal origins of disease, growth and 
development, genetics, natural history, underlying disease, responses of the right ventricle, 
responsiveness to PAH-specific therapies, and gaps in knowledge, particularly in the youngest age 
groups. 
EMA/140777/2023 
Page 92/101 
 
 
  
 
Because of the limitations in conducting paediatric studies, therapeutic strategies used for adult PAH 
have not been studied sufficiently in children to allow the definition of potential toxicities or optimal 
dosing..  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Therapies that are currently approved for the treatment of PAH in adults, in various geographies 
around the world, include prostacyclin and its analogues (epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost and 
beraprost), endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs; bosentan, macitentan and ambrisentan), PDE5 
inhibitors (sildenafil and tadalafil), soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat) and selective 
prostacyclin receptor agonist (selexipag). Of them, sildenafil and bosentan are approved in children. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study LVHV, the single pivotal trial in this application, was a phase 3, international, randomised, 
multicentre, 2-period (24 weeks double-blind placebo-controlled period [Period 1] and open-label 
extension (OLE) of up to 2 years [Period 2], add-on (i.e. in addition to the subject’s current endothelin 
receptor antagonist [ERA]) study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and population pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of tadalafil administered orally once daily (QD), as the authorized tablets (20 mg) or as a ready-
to-use suspension (2.0 mg/mL), to at least 34 paediatric patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH).. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The efficacy data of tadalafil in children with PAH is mainly based on study LVHV (n=35), coupled with 
an extrapolation exercise from adults (Bayesian MMRM sensitivity analysis).  
The primary objective of period 1 was to evaluate the efficacy of tadalafil compared with placebo in 
improving 6MWD from baseline to Week 24, as assessed in patients ≥ 6 to < 18 years of age who 
were developmentally capable of performing a 6MW test. The change in 6MWD from baseline to the 
end of period 1 (Week 24) in the tadalafil treatment group (60.48 meters) showed numerically higher 
increase in Least-Square (LS) mean 6MWD at Week 24 than placebo group (36.60 meters), with a 
placebo-adjusted LS mean treatment difference of 23.88 meters (80% CI, -14.25, 62.00).  
Additionally, in paediatric patients with PAH aged ≥ 2 to < 18 years, an exposure-response (ER) 
model was used to predict 6MWD based upon paediatric exposure following 20 or 40 mg daily doses 
estimated using a Population PK model and an established adult ER model (H6D-MC-LVGY). The 
model demonstrated similarity of response between model-predicted and the actual observed 6MWD 
in paediatric patients aged 6 to < 18 years from Study H6D-MC-LVHV. 
Three Bayesian MMRM sensitivity analyses were conducted: Bayesian MMRM analysis with diffuse 
prior and mixture prior using weight of 0.5 and 0.8. The analysis with mixture prior weight 0.8 
resulted in the posterior mean difference of 27.13 m and 80% credible interval (4.94 to 42.73), which 
supports the positive trend suggested by the primary analysis in Study LVHV.  
Clinical worsening cases were only recorded in five subjects who received tadalafil during the Period 2 
of the study LVHV (1 new-onset syncope, 2 increase in ERA dose, 1 addition of new PAH-specific 
concomitant therapy, and 1 hospitalization for PAH progression).  
The positive trend of potential efficacy of tadalafil versus placebo observed in the 6MWD as primary

efficacy  endpoint,  seems  to  be  supported  by  the  majority  of  the  additional  efficacy  measurements, 
such as NT-Pro-BNP (treatment difference -127.4, 95% CI, -247.05 to -7.80), WHO functional class 
for  Period  1  (improved  in  tadalafil  40.0%,  placebo  20.0%;  no  worsening  from  either  group), 
echocardiographic  parameters  (TAPSE:  treatment  difference  0.43,  95%  CI,  0.14  to  0.71;  left 
ventricular  eccentricity  index  [EI]-systolic:  treatment  difference  -0.40,  95%  CI,  -0.87  to  0.07;  left 
ventricular EI-diastolic: treatment difference -0.17, 95% CI, -0.43 to 0.09; 3 subjects with reported 
pericardial effusion for placebo group, absent for these subjects at baseline in tadalafil, during Period 
1), CGI-I (improved in tadalafil 64.3%, placebo 46.7%). All subtest domains and summary score on 
physical  and  psychological  dimensions  in  CHQ-PF28  did  not  show  a  difference between  tadalafil  and 
placebo treatment group, with the exception of Global Health (treatment difference 7.26, 95% CI, -
9.25 to 23.77). 
The main supportive study (for effectiveness) is the Japanese post-marketing study (H6D-JE-TD01). 
Among the 391 paediatric patients included (23.3% of the total population), 79 patients were less than 
1 year of age, 163 patients were 1 to 6 years, 110 patients were 7 to 14 years, and 39 patients were 
15 to 18 years. Mean age ± standard deviation (SD) was 5.7 ± 5.34 years, and 51.7% of the patients 
were boys. Changes in WHO classification showed a tendency toward improvement at 3 months, 1 
year, 2 years after the start of administration, and final observation in paediatrics was 8.6% (30/348 
patients), 16.5% (40/243 patients), 19.7% (26/132 patients), and 16.3% (57/349 patients), 
respectively. The incidence of deterioration in WHO functional class at 3 months, 1 year and 2 years 
was 0.6% (2/348 patients), 0.8% (2/243 patients), 1.5% (2/132 patients), and 2.3% (8/349 
patients), respectively. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There were important doubts about the predictive capacity of the PBPK model to be able to establish 
a dose recommendation in population groups where there is no experimental evidence. It is unlikely 
that  an  accurate  posology  in  children  aged  6  months  to  <  2  years  could  be  recommended  without 
generating some clinical PK data in this age subset. In addition, the lack of a PK study to assess the 
food  effect  was  considered  a  major  inconvenience  for  establishing  the  posology  in  younger  children 
and  the  company  did  not  commit  to  conduct  the  drug-food  interaction  study  with  the  oral  solution 
suggested by the CHMP.  
Sample size of the single pivotal trial was rather small. A total of thirty-five patients, 16 male and 19 
female,  aged  6  to  17  years  were  randomly  (1:1)  assigned  to  placebo  (n=18)  or  tadalafil  (n=17) 
treatment in Period 1 of this study and received at least 1 dose of study medication. The majority of 
the  subjects  (n=  32;  94.1%)  were  taking  bosentan  as  concomitant  ERA.  PAH  aetiologies  were 
idiopathic  PAH  (n=26;  74.3%).  In  the  initially  applied  indication,  the  MAH  claimed  that  “Efficacy  in 
patients  ≥  6  years  in  terms  of  improvement  of  exercise  capacity  has  been  shown  in  IPAH  and  PAH 
associated  with  surgical  repair  of  at  least  6-month  duration  of  simple  congenital  systemic  to 
pulmonary shunt”. However, the number of patients with PAH associated with surgical repair is very 
scarce  (only  2/17  subjects  in  tadalafil  group,  study  LVHV).  The  MAH  was  unable  to  provide  further 
efficacy or effectiveness data in this subgroup, either from other clinical trials or  from observational 
studies or registries, and therefore this disease aetiology was deleted from the proposed indication. 
The majority of subjects (n=25 [71.4%]) were in the heavy-weight cohort with the remainder (n=10 
[28.6%]) in the middle-weight cohort. Due to a smaller sample size (35 subjects) than originally 
planned (134 subjects) in the study, the balance of the stratification factors weight cohorts, PAH 
aetiology and type of concomitant ERA were not achieved among the treatment groups. The lack of 
enrolled patients in the light-weight (<25 kg) and patients < 2 years cohort could negatively impact on 
EMA/140777/2023 
Page 94/101 
 
 
  
 
 
the limits of a claimed therapeutic indication for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in 
the paediatric population.  
The Company reviewed the disease course, response, and the PK/PD-relationships. It was agreed that 
the  disease  course  in  children  less  than  6  years  is  very  similar  to  adults  and,  therefore,  it  can  be 
expected  a  similar  response  based  upon  PK/PD  relationships  and  exposure-matching.  Extrapolation 
from adults based on exposure matching was accepted.  
Although  statistical  significance  testing  was  not  performed  between  the  tadalafil  and  placebo 
treatment  groups  due  to  the  low  sample  size,  a  positive  trend  can  be  ascertained  in  terms  of  the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint.  Nevertheless,  when  the  change  in  6MWD  was  also  evaluated  during  the 
Period  2  (from  Period  2  baseline  to  the  end  of  Period  2  [Month  24;  Visit  17])  as  additional  efficacy 
variable, the mean 6MWD decreased by 4.58 meters in the Pla-Tad group and 32.58 meters in Tad-
Tad  group.  Mentioned  differences  on  the  improvement  in  exercise  capacity  may  be  due  to  the 
difficulties to interpret extension efficacy data where there is no control group. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
Regarding safety results, there were no deaths in neither period. There were no SAEs or 
discontinuations due to AEs during Period 1, but 5 SAEs (acute right ventricular failure, anemia, 
gastroenteritis, hemoptysis, and pneumonia) were reported during Period 2. None of the SAEs were 
considered to be related to study medication or study procedures. One subject was discontinued due 
to AE (headache) during Period 2. Therefore, no concern or clear pattern emerges based upon these 
events. 
The overall incidence of AEs was higher in tadalafil group compared with placebo. During Period 1, 
there were 23 subjects who reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) (8/18 
[44.4%] subjects in the placebo group and 15/17 [88.2%] subjects in the tadalafil group). The most 
common TEAE, occurring in ≥2 subjects in any group, were headache (29.4%, tadalafil; 11.1%, 
placebo) and upper respiratory tract infection (17.6%, tadalafil; 5.6%, placebo). All of the AEs in the 
tadalafil group were mild or moderate in severity. Treatment-related AEs were reported in 9 subjects 
(1/18 [5.6%] subject in the placebo group and 8/17 [47.1%] subjects in the tadalafil group). The most 
common of these AEs, occurring in ≥2 subjects in tadalafil group, was headache (23.5%, tadalafil; 
5.6%, placebo). In the tadalafil group, only 1 subject experienced hypotension and only 1 subject 
experienced 1 AE of hepatic enzyme elevation, but did not meet the criteria of having an AST and ALT 
more than 3-fold the ULN. 
For Period 2 (OLE), there were 23 of the 32 subjects (71.9%) who reported at least 1 TEAE, being the 
most common (≥2 subjects), headache, dizziness, nasopharyngitis and vomiting; each reported by 
18.8% of the treated subjects. The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Treatment-
related AEs were reported in 5 of the 32 subjects (15.6%). The most common of these AEs occurring 
in Period 2 were dizziness and headache (6.3% of the subjects each). 
The risk of AEs of special interest (AESIs) does not seem to be increased in this population. One 
patient in Period 1 experienced an AESI of hypotension (treatment-related AE) that did not lead to 
treatment discontinuation and resolved. There were no AEs of priapism. A total of 2 subjects (1 in 
each period; 2 AE) experienced spontaneous intermittent penile erection that resolved spontaneously. 
There was 1 event of a visual abnormality (photopsia) during Period 2 that was not considered to be 
related to tadalafil by the Investigator. There were 4 subjects (all on tadalafil; 6 AEs) with uterine 
bleeding during the study. Only one of them was associated with an SAE of anemia and required a 
blood transfusion and all were resolved without treatment discontinuation. None of the subjects 
EMA/140777/2023 
Page 95/101 
 
 
  
 
experienced hearing abnormalities during the study.  
Main long-term data come from the 32 patients who entered the 24-month long-term OLE period 
(Period 2 of Study LVHV) of which 26 patients completed it. Additional data from the 18 patients from 
Period 2 of Study LVIG (2 years) were available, in conjunction with supportive Japanese patients from 
observational study (H6D-JE-TD01) which also provides data up to 2 years. No new long-term safety 
concerns were observed either. Supportive safety data from study LVIG, postmarketing and literature 
data concurs with the data observed from LVHV study. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There is limited sample size included in clinical trials (51 PAH patients treated with tadalafil). Although, 
it is accepted that due the rarity of the disease, the safety database may be quite limited, some 
limitations regarding the provided sample size should be pointed out:  
There is a lack of controlled data from patients <6 years and only data from 17 patients aged >6 years 
are controlled. The observational Study TD01 is the only study that provides safety data in patients <2 
years old, while safety data for patients ≥2 years and <6 years also comes from study TD01 and the 
open label of Phase 1b/2 LVIG Study. 
Inherent limitations to Study TD01 (observational nature, uncontrolled design, confounding factors) 
and to Study LVIG (uncontrolled design and limited subgroup’s sample size) should be not be 
overlooked and, therefore, it is acknowledged that a robust conclusion on safety results cannot be 
drawn. 
A possible collection of post-marketing data by means of a new clinical trial in these lower-age patients 
is not view as feasible by the MAH due to known recruitment challenges. Despite of this fact, the MAH 
will continue to review all paediatric events through routine pharmacovigilance activities.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy data of tadalafil in children with PAH is mainly based on study LVHV (n=35), coupled with 
an extrapolation exercise from adults (Bayesian MMRM sensitivity analysis).  
In study LHVH there was an improvement in exercise capacity (6MWD) (point estimate of 23.88 
meters in the main analysis and between 21.14m to 27.13 m in the Bayesian MMRM analyses). The 
6MWD endpoint has been shown in the adult PAH population to correlate with long term clinical 
outcome and is generally used to follow exercise tolerance in paediatric PAH patients of appropriate 
age, being a reliable test in children ≥ 7 years. Interventional clinical trials in adults with PAH have 
commonly used the 6MWD test to demonstrate efficacy for drug approval [Ollivier, et al. J Am Heart 
Assoc. 2019;8:e011306].  
EMA/140777/2023 
Page 98/101 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In absolute terms, the increase in 6MWD was consistent with the one reported in adults. The main 
analysis of 6MWD was also supported by three Bayesian MMRM sensitivity analyses and favourable 
trends observed in other secondary endpoints.  6MWD in study LVHV may be considered of clinical 
relevance and is consistent with the 26 metres improvement observed in adults with tadalafil 40 mg 
(placebo-adjusted median increase in 6MWD).  
The risks observed in the paediatric population were similar to those found in adults, with headache 
and hypotension occurring commonly. These events are usually mild to moderate and manageable in 
standard practice. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy data of tadalafil in children with PAH is mainly based on exploratory data from study LVHV 
(n=35) in children ≥ 6 years, coupled with a extrapolation exercise from adults (Bayesian MMRM 
sensitivity analysis) and a PK/PD modelling (children 2-6 years) and simulation (children between 6 
months and 2 years). This is mainly due to limited availability of pharmacodynamic measures and lack 
of a suitable and approved clinical endpoint, but also due to the lack of insufficient recruitment in PK 
and efficacy trials. 
The benefits observed in exercise capacity in study LVHV in children were consistent with those found 
in adults. An ad hoc analysis of responders in 6MWD of study LVHV was also numerically in favour of 
tadalafil vs. placebo. The risks observed in the paediatric population were also similar to those found in 
adults. Therefore, the balance between benefits and risks observed in children can be regarded as 
similarly positive as in adults. 
However, the pivotal study LVHV has several limitations, mainly related to the small sample size, and 
is exploratory in nature. No inferences of statistical superiority versus placebo can be made. 
Furthermore, the number of children is insufficient to allow for any conclusion in some of the patients’ 
subsets mentioned in the proposed indication (i.e. PAH due to surgical repair) or children <25 kg body 
weight or <2 years old, for whom no clinical data of efficacy have been generated.  
The MAH has provided effectiveness data in children < 6 years from observational study TD01 in Japan 
(n=391 paediatric patients), which are supportive, but the dose used in study TD01 is higher than the 
one recommended in the SmPC: the median dose in children aged <1 year in study TD01 was 5 mg 
(and not 4 mg as proposed), while in children between 1 and 2 years, the median dose was 7 mg (and 
not 6 mg as proposed). Despite having accepted the possibility of extrapolation from adults, further 
refinement of the PBPK model was requested in patients 2-8 years of age was needed, coupled with a 
proposed dosing regimen where the exposure in paediatric patients match the adult exposures for 
which efficacy and safety has been established. 
Even after the refinement of the PBPK model, there were still important doubts about the predictive 
capacity of the PBPK model to be able to establish a dose recommendation in population groups where 
there is no experimental evidence. Based on a “refinement” of the PBPK model the applicant proposed 
a new posology for children below 2 years that was twice the dose proposed initially. The CHMP 
concluded that it is unlikely that a recommendation for an accurate posology in children aged 6 months 
to < 2 years could be made without the availability of some clinical PK data in this age subset. In 
addition, the lack of a PK study to assess the food effect is considered a major inconvenient for 
establishing the posology in younger children and the company is not able to conduct the drug-food 
interaction study with the oral solution suggested by the CHMP. All these outstanding issues prevented 
from including children < 2 years in the indication. However, the B/R was considered positive for 
children aged 2 years and older.

During the procedure, the MAH proposed to include “positive trend towards improvement in terms of 
exercise capacity” in the wording of the indication and not to delete “PAH associated with surgical 
repair”. Both statements were considered inappropriate. Regarding the mention of positive trends in 
6MWD in the paediatric indication, it may be interpreted as the CHMP as approving an indication based 
on trends only, and such statement is misleading. In addition, no extrapolation from adults to children 
can be made for PAH due to surgical repair, as this aetiology is not approved for adults. The said PAH 
aetiology was finally removed from the requested indication. 
The paediatric indication finally accepted was “Treatment of paediatric patients aged 2 years and above 
with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) classified as WHO functional class II and III”. 
It was mainly based in the extrapolation exercise from adults accepted in the CHMP guidelines (EMA 
reflection paper EMA/189724/2018 and related guidelines), coupled with PK data and PK/PD modelling. 
It included only children aged 2 years and above (as no accurate dose could be defined for children 
between 6 months and less than 2 years) and no mention was made to improve exercise capacity or 
disease aetiology due to the reasons discussed above.

N/A. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Adcirca is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Adcirca is not similar to Opsumit, Adempas and 
Trepulmix within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix 
on similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of, Adcirca favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of paediatric patients aged 2 years and above with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
classified as WHO functional class II and III. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Adcirca subject to 
the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

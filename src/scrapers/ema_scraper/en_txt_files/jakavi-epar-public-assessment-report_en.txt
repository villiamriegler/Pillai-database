2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) that can present as an apparently de novo 
disorder termed primary MF (PMF) or evolve from other MPNs and can be termed secondary MF, post 
Polycythaemia Vera MF (PPV-MF) or post Essential Thrombocythaemia MF (PET-MF). The 10-year risk 
of developing MF is < 4% in ET and 10% in PV. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 65 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 7/84
 
 
 
 
years. The incidence of PMF has been shown to increase with age and is estimated at 0.4 to 1.4 cases 
per 100,000 individuals per year in Western countries (Barosi, et al 2011). 
MF is characterised by a clonal stem cell proliferation associated with production of elevated levels of 
several inflammatory and proangiogenic cytokines. Resulting bone marrow stromal reaction includes 
varying degrees of collagen fibrosis, osteosclerosis and angiogenesis. The altered bone marrow milieu 
results in release of hematopoietic stem cells into the blood and extramedullary hematopoiesis, 
particularly hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. MF results in laboratory and physical exam abnormalities 
including progressive anaemia, leucopenia or leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia or thrombocythaemia, 
ineffective haematopoiesis and haematopoietic failure, massive splenomegaly and portal hypertension, 
and progression to leukaemia. Clinically, patients suffer from the consequences of massive 
splenomegaly including abdominal pain or discomfort and pain under the left costal margin, risk of 
vascular events (including thrombosis and haemorrhage), severe constitutional symptoms (fevers, 
night sweats, weight loss), a hypermetabolic state, cachexia and premature death. Causes of death for 
patients with MF include leukaemic transformation, infections, bleeding, thrombosis, heart failure, liver 
failure, solid tumours, respiratory failure, and portal hypertension. 
The IWG-MRT identified 5 risk factors independently associated with shortened survival in PMF, termed 
the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS): age > 65 years, presence of constitutional 
symptoms (weight loss, fever, or night sweats), anaemia as determined by haemoglobin (Hgb) 
< 10 g/dL or evidenced by the need for chronic red blood cell transfusions, leucocytosis (white blood 
cell [WBC] count > 25 x 109/L), and a circulating peripheral blood blast percentage of ≥ 1%. The IWG-
MRT identified 4 risk groups with non-overlapping survival curves based on the absence or presence of 
1 or more of these risk factors. The median survival of patients was 135 months in the Low risk group 
(zero risk factors), 95 months in the Intermediate-1 risk group (one risk factor), 48 months in the 
Intermediate-2 risk group (two risk factors), and 27 months in the High risk group (≥ 3 risk factors). 
Analysis of relative survival showed that mortality in all of the patients at 5 and 10 years after 
diagnosis was 40% and 60% greater, respectively, than the expected mortality in a general population 
with similar demographic characteristics. 
In the EU, hydroxyurea (HU) is approved on a national basis in a few countries (e.g. France, Italy, 
Sweden and Spain) and is used to control excessive myeloproliferation. Other therapies used to treat 
MF include danazol, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, androgens and prednisone, and 
immunomodulatory agents. Other therapeutic options include splenectomy and splenic irradiation and 
the potentially curative option of allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT). However, the 1-year 
transplant-related mortality in patients who undergo alloSCT is 27% (Ditschkowski, et al 2004), and 
alloSCT is rarely a viable option in patients > 60 years of age. 
The impact of fatigue on patients with MF is profound; of 456 MF patients, 84% reported fatigue, 
without difference according to primary vs. secondary MF (Mesa, et al 2007).  
Within the past 5 years, it has been found that approximately 96% of patients with PV, 65% of 
patients with PMF and 55% of patients with ET have a somatic gain-of-function mutation in the JAK2 
resulting in substitution of phenylalanine for valine at position 617 (JAK2V617F) within the 
pseudokinase domain. JAK2 is one of four Janus kinases. Erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and 
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor have been shown to signal only through receptors 
which utilize JAK2 homodimers. JAK signalling involves recruitment of signal transducers and activators 
of transcription (STAT) to cytokine receptors, activation, and subsequent localization of STATs to the 
nucleus leading to modulation of gene expression.  
It is also apparent that PMF, as well as ET and rarely even PV, occurs in the absence of the JAK2V617F 
mutation. However, it appears that the majority of patients with MF have overactivation of the JAK-
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 8/84
 
 
 
 
STAT pathway, regardless of JAK2V617F status. Increased JAK2 signalling, evidenced by constitutively 
phosphorylated STAT3, is not strictly dependent on the presence of JAK2V617F mutation. Patients with 
MF demonstrate high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), which 
are likely responsible for the hypercatabolic state and constitutional symptoms, such as weight loss 
and fatigue, frequently seen in these patients. Many of these pro-inflammatory cytokines use JAK1, 
which is hyperactivated in the peripheral blood of patients with MF. The association of JAK1 with the 
very high levels of JAK activating inflammatory cytokines provides a rationale for the alleviation of 
constitutional symptoms through JAK1 inhibition. Cytokine elevations in MF occur regardless of 
mutational status or disease subtype.  
About the product 
Ruxolitinib (INCB018424 phosphate, INC424, ruxolitinib phosphate) is a selective inhibitor of Janus 
Associated Kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2 (IC50 values of 3.3 nM and 2.8 nM, respectively) which mediates 
the signalling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for haematopoiesis and 
immune function. The chemical name is (R)-3-(4-(7H-pyrrolo [2, 3-d] pyrimidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-
yl)-3-cyclopentylpropanenitrile phosphate. The molecular formula is C17H21N6O4P and the molecular 
weight is 404.36. 
The compound was originally developed by Incyte Corporation, Wilmington, Delaware, USA. Incyte and 
Novartis have entered into a joint partnership for the co-development of ruxolitinib in haematology and 
oncology. 
The applicant claimed the approval for the following indication: 
Jakavi is indicated for treatment of adult patients with myelofibrosis, including primary myelofibrosis 
(also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post 
essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is: 
Jakavi is indicated for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients 
with primary myelofibrosis (also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post polycythaemia vera 
myelofibrosis or post essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The product is presented as immediate release tablets containing 5 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg of ruxolitinib 
(as ruxolitinib phosphate) as active substance. Other ingredients are lactose monohydrate, 
microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, colloidal anhydrous silica, sodium starch glycolate, 
povidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose 
The tablets are packed in High-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with induction seal and child-
resistant closure.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance

Chemical structure 
Manufacture 
Ruxolitinib phosphate is chemically synthesised in seven steps. Adequate in-process controls are 
applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents, have been presented. The active substance is purified by recrystallisation.  
Batch analysis data produced with the proposed synthetic route provided show that the active 
substance can be manufactured reproducibly. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual examination), particle size 
(laser diffraction) identification of Ruxolitinib (IR, X-ray), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), 
water (KF), Heavy metals, sodium (ICP-OES), assay and related substances (HPLC) 
The specifications reflect all relevant quality attributes of the active substance. The analytical methods 
used in the routine controls are suitability described. The validation studies are in accordance with the 
ICH Guidelines. Impurity limits in the specification are justified by toxicology studies.  
Certificates of analysis issued by the active substance manufacturer are provided. The results comply 
with the specifications, and show good uniformity from batch to batch.  
Stability 
Four batches of the active substance have been storage under long term ICH conditions (25°C/60% 
RH) up to 24 months and under accelerated ICH conditions (40°C 75% RH). The primary stability 
batches are stored in sealed LDPE bags inside HDPE container. This packaging is considered to be 
equivalent to the proposed commercial packaging of sealed double LDPE bags inside metal containers. 
The parameters investigated during stability include parameters such as appearance, identifications by 
HPLC, water content, assay and impurities.  
Photostability data was also provided. One batch was directly exposed to light (1200 and 2400klux). 
Exposure of the free base to light (1200 and 2400klux) causes a change in the colour of the active 
substance and showed that the free base is sensitive to light. Therefore it is recommended that 
ruxolitinib phosphate should be protected from light where possible.  
Stability data under stress testing conditions after 1 month storage at 50°C and 60°C, each at <30% 
RH and at 75% RH, without packaging (open) was also provided.  
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 11/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other stability data under stress testing conditions: at 80°C under nitrogen, oxygen, and with 2% 
water in sealed ampoules, in acidic solutions at 50°C and 70°C and basic solutions at 50°C up to one 
month storage  was also provided.  
The results justify the retest period proposed by the applicant in the intended packaged. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The properties of the active substance suggested that a tablet manufacturing process based upon wet 
granulation might be suitable for development of a market formulation.  
The excipients selected are standard ingredients in tablet formulations, and are in compliance with 
internationally accepted pharmacopoeial standards. The compatibility between active substance and 
excipients was investigated during development. Stability studies on tablets at accelerated conditions 
of 40°C/75% RH and long term at 25°C/60% RH support the use of all the excipients in the finished 
product formulation. 
During the development the influence of the medium pH and the dissolution behaviour of the tablets 
were investigated. The results showed that dissolution medium pH has no significant impact on the 
dissolution due to the high solubility of the substance over the physiological pH range. Dissolution 
method developed was shown to be discriminatory however not optimal for the higher strength. 
Therefore unless other dissolution methods are shown to be non-discriminatory, the proposed 
dissolution method should be replaced. It is recommended to develop and replace the propose method 
with a more optimal one. 
The proposed formulations have also been used for the batches used in the clinical and pre-clinical 
studies.  
All excipients chosen are well-known and comply with the Ph Eur. The specification is considered 
justified based on batch and stability data and considering relevant guidance’s and requirements. The 
limits for degradation products are acceptable, considering ICH requirements. 
The composition is: lactose monohydrate (filler), cellulose microcrystalline (filler), sodium starch 
glycolate (disintegrant), magnesium stearate (lubricant), stearic acid (lubricant), colloidal silicon 
dioxide (Glidant), hydroxypropyl cellulose (binder), povidone (binder) 
The description and choice of container closure system is in accordance with the EU plastic directive 
2002/72/EC and 94/62/EC. The tablets will be packaged in HDPE bottles with HDPE cap with a 
polypropylene inner closure. The raw materials are stated to comply with Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 “Polyolefines” 
and Ph. Eur. 3.2.2 “Plastic Containers and Closure for Pharmaceutical use”. 
The experience with the active substance and the data from the stability studies performed with the 
tablets shows that the chosen HDPE bottles with HDPE cap with a polypropylene inner closure are 
considered sufficiently protective, compatible with the finished product and adequate to support the 
stability and use of the medicinal product. 
Adventitious agents 
The lactose monohydrate is of animal origin. It is manufactured from milk sourced from healthy 
animals in the same conditions as milk collected for human consumption. No other ruminant materials, 
with the exception of calf rennet, are used in the preparation. Regarding the TSE compliance of the 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 12/84
 
 
 
 
Lactose monohydrate, it is confirmed that the lactose used is in accordance with the Public Statement 
(EMEA/CPMP/571/02).) 
Manufacture of the product 
The proposed commercial manufacturing process involves blending, wetting, sieving and tabletting. 
The manufacturing process of ruxolitinib tablets is robust and consistently yields drug product that 
meets the predetermined quality characteristics. A summary of the process validation protocol that will 
be used to validate the commercial process at commercial scale in the commercial site as listed in the 
dossier is presented in a Process Validation Scheme for the Drug Product. 
For each strength, three validation batches will be processed using the same process and the same 
equipment as the batches intended for marketing.  
The batch analysis data show that the product can be manufactured reproducibly according to the 
agreed finished product specification.  
Product specification 
The product specifications include tests by validated methods for appearance, identity tests of 
Ruxolitinib phosphate (HPLC, UV), water (KF), uniformity of dosage units by content uniformity (HPLC), 
degradations products (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), enantiomer (HPLC), microbial enumeration test (Ph 
Eur), and assay (HPLC, 95-105 %). 
The tests and limits of the specifications for the finished product are appropriate to control the quality 
of the finished product for their intended purpose. 
Batch analysis data on twelve batches of 5 mg tablets, one batch of 15 mg tablets and three batches of 
20 mg confirm satisfactory uniformity of the product at release. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data was provided for three batches of finished product at the lowest (5mg) and highest 
(25mg) strengths. While the 25mg tablet is not part of the current application, as all of the strengths 
are quantitatively proportional and manufactured by compressing varying amounts of a common final 
blend, the use of the 5mg and 25mg is considered to have bracketed the 15mg and 20mg tablet 
strengths. The stability batches are a mixture of pilot and commercial scale batches. 
The formulations meet the requirements for bracketing as laid out in ICH Q1D “Bracketing and 
Matrixing Designs for Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products”. 
Furthermore, the stability batches are tested to the same finished product specification as that of 
proposed commercial batches. The stability batches are packed in the proposed HDPE bottle and 
closure packaging. 
Stability data is provided for the proposed product at 25ºC/60%RH and 40ºC/75%RH. Stability testing 
parameters included: appearance, water content, assay of ruxolitinib, degradation products and 
dissolution. 
Photostability data in line with ICH requirement has been carried out for one batch of 5mg and 25mg 
tablet. These batches are manufactured at the proposed finished product manufacturing site. No 
significant difference was observed between tablets exposed to light stress condition and unexposed 
control samples. Therefore it can be concluded that ruxolitinib tablets are not sensitive to light. The 
proposed HDPE bottle and closure packaging is considered to provide adequate protection.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC 
are acceptable 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The CHMP recommends development and replacement of the current apparatus II paddle method with 
the apparatus I basket method used for the dissolution testing. Upon finalisation of the development 
and validation the new method should be introduced via appropriate regulatory procedure. As a 
consequence, the product specification for dissolution testing should also be revised. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The goal of the nonclinical studies was to support the registration of ruxolitinib for the proposed 
indication. 
The rat and dog were selected as the rodent and non-rodent species for chronic toxicity testing 
because both have historically been used in safety evaluations, and ruxolitinib is pharmacologically 
active in both species. The oral route was chosen because it is the intended route of administration in 
humans. 
Additional nonclinical studies have been conducted to support the development of ruxolitinib phosphate 
cream as a topical formulation for the treatment of patients with psoriasis. These include repeated 
dose topical studies of up to 9 months in duration in the minipig, dose range finding topical studies for 
a 2-year dermal carcinogenicity study in mice, a murine local lymph node assay, acute skin and ocular 
irritation studies in rabbit, phototoxicity and photoallergy studies in the guinea pig, and an in vitro 
photoclastogenicity study. The results of these studies have not been included in this assessment 
report since the therapeutic indication for this submission is the oral route only. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Ruxolitinib is a potent ATP competitive inhibitor of JAK1 (IC50 = 3.3 ± 1.2 nM) and JAK2 (IC50 = 2.8 
± 1.2 nM), with modest selectivity against TYK2 (IC50 = 19 ± 3.2 nM) and marked selectivity against 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 14/84
 
 
 
 
JAK3 (IC50 = 428 ± 243 nM), when assessed at 1 mM ATP concentrations. The results from further 
testing against a broad panel of 30 kinases using the respective Km concentrations of ATP for each 
individual kinase support that ruxolitinib is a selective inhibitor of JAKs.  
Ruxolitinib inhibited JAK-STAT signalling and cell proliferation of cytokine-dependent cellular models of 
haematological malignancies, as well as of Ba/F3 cells rendered cytokine-independent by expressing 
the JAK2V617F mutated protein, with IC50 ranging from 80-320 nM. 
The effect of ruxolitinib on the growth of progenitor colonies derived from mononuclear cells from 
patients with PV was also evaluated in colony-forming assays. Ruxolitinib inhibited erythroid colony 
formation with an IC50 of 223 nM compared to 407 nM for normal donors. While cells bearing the 
JAK2V617F mutation were not significantly more sensitive to ruxolitinib compared to cells from healthy 
volunteers with respect to colony formation in the presence of optimal erythropoietin concentrations, 
growth factor-independent colony formation, a unique characteristic of PV and other MPNs, was 
inhibited more potently with an IC50 of 67 nM. 
The potency in blocking JAK activity in hematopoietic cells in vivo was established in a whole blood 
assay that measured STAT3 phosphorylation in response to IL-6 or thrombopoietin (TPO) stimulation. 
In human whole blood, exogenous ruxolitinib blocked IL-6 or TPO induced STAT3 phosphorylation with 
IC50 values of 282 nM and 281 nM, respectively. There were no effects on total STAT3 levels. Similar 
results were obtained using whole blood from dogs (IC50 = 119 nM), rats (IC50 = 95 nM) and rabbits 
(IC50 = 600 nM).  
Treatment of mice with ruxolitinib resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of phosphorylated STAT3 
and tumour growth in the cytokine-dependent INA-6 multiple myeloma xenograft model.  
Ruxolitinib also inhibited splenomegaly in mice resulting from intravenous inoculation of cells 
expressing the clinically relevant JAK2V617F mutation. Moreover, genomic PCR analysis of spleen 
samples to detect JAK2V617F cells showed that the mutant allele burden was significantly decreased 
by treatment with ruxolitinib (33% decrease, P < 0.01). Mice bearing Ba/F3-JAK2V617F cells and 
treated with ruxolitinib had a significantly improved survival compared to animals treated with vehicle. 
After 3 weeks of treatment, > 90% of vehicle-treated mice had succumbed to disease while > 90% of 
ruxolitinib-treated mice survived. Treatment with ruxolitinib also reduced inflammatory cytokine levels 
(e.g. TNF-α, IL-6) in these mice.  
The major metabolites of ruxolitinib were active but demonstrated slightly to significantly weaker 
activity than the parent compound in both enzyme and cell-based assays (IL-6 induced INA-6 
proliferation and IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation).  
The results from the various primary pharmacodynamic studies show that ruxolitinib and its major 
metabolites have inhibitory effects on JAKs at clinically relevant concentration (Cmax at highest clinical 
dose is 1.48 µM). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The effects of ruxolitinib on inflammatory cytokine-stimulated activation of JAK/STAT signalling and its 
functional consequences were examined in vitro in human T cells and peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs).  The therapeutic utility of ruxolitinib in inflammatory diseases in vivo was evaluated in 
the rat adjuvant induced arthritis (rAIA) model.  The results indicate a potential utility of oral or topical 
ruxolitinib for treatment of inflammatory conditions.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Ruxolitinib did not demonstrate significant cross-reactivity with any of the 50 in vitro binding assays 
and enzyme assays in which it was evaluated but 26% inhibition at 1 μM was noted for the human 
adenosine 1 receptor (hA1) which prompted determination of an IC50 value for ruxolitinib-mediated 
inhibition of binding to this adenosine receptor, and the other adenosine family of receptors. The IC50 
values for hA1, hA2a and hA2b receptors were 2.1 μM, > 30 μM and 11 μM, respectively. 
The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of ruxolitinib on the hERG potassium current was 131.6 μM. The 
Cmax at the highest proposed therapeutic dose in humans (25 mg bid) is 1.48 μM (0.049 μM 
unbound) [INCYTE-DMB-10.56.3]. Therefore, the risk of inhibition of hERG in humans given ruxolitinib 
appears to be low. Additionally, a study to assess the effects of ruxolitinib on heart rate corrected QT 
intervals in healthy subjects has been undertaken [INCB 18424-138]. 
In vivo, ruxolitinib was evaluated in CNS and respiratory studies in the rat and in a cardiovascular 
study in telemeterized conscious dogs. Two findings in safety pharmacology nonclinical assessments 
were considered to be adverse: decreases in minute volume in female rats given a single oral dose of 
150 mg/kg (NOAEL 50mg/kg) in a respiratory assessment of ruxolitinib; and decreases in arterial 
blood pressure along with increases in heart rate in radiotelemetry-implanted conscious dogs dosed 30 
mg/kg (NOAEL 10mg/kg). The mean Cmax in female rats at the NOAEL dose of 50 mg/kg and in dogs 
at the NOAEL dose of 10 mg/kg are 10.4-fold and 15.7-fold greater, respectively, than the Cmax at the 
highest proposed therapeutic dose in humans (25 mg bid) associated with a mean Cmax value of 1.48 
μM (0.049 μM unbound).  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No formal drug interactions studies were carried out. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The methods of analyses have been adequately validated in compliance with GLP.  
Ruxolitinib exhibited a high apparent permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayers and the data indicate that 
ruxolitinib crosses Caco-2 cell monolayers through a passive mechanism and is not a substrate for 
transporters including P-gp.  
Absorption 
Ruxolitinib was rapidly absorbed with variable but high oral bioavailability in mice, rats, rabbits and 
dogs with a similarly short half-life after single and multiple dosing. Tmax values ranged from 0.5 to 
2 h; comparably to humans, in whom Tmax was reached within 1 to 3 h after a single oral dose. The 
terminal elimination half-life was generally short after oral and i.v. dosing, ranging from 0.4 h (rat) 
to 2.5 h (dog), comparable to that in humans after oral dosing, which was approximately 3 h. In mice 
and dogs, there were minimal or no gender differences, but there were gender differences in rats with 
a several-fold difference in oral exposure between male and female rats likely due to more extensive 
metabolism in male rats compared to females.  
Distribution 
Blood partitioning results indicate minor to no preferential partitioning of [14C] ruxolitinib -derived 
radioactivity into blood cells of mice, rats, dogs and humans. 
The plasma protein binding of ruxolitinib is species-dependent. The ex vivo fraction unbound as 
determined in plasma from CByB6F1 Hybrid mice, CD-1 mice, hairless mice, rats, rabbits and dogs 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 16/84
 
 
 
 
given ruxolitinib was 4.9%, 2.7%, 3.0%, 18%, 13%  and 9.7%, respectively. The in vitro 
fraction unbound in human plasma was 3.3%. 
In Sprague-Dawley (albino) rats, the highest concentrations of drug-derived radioactivity were 
observed in the tissues and contents of the gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, renal cortex, renal 
medulla, liver, aorta, and adrenal gland. In Long-Evans (pigmented) rats, the highest concentrations of 
radioactivity were in the tissues and contents of the gastrointestinal tract, followed by urine, bile, uveal 
tract, liver, renal medulla, renal cortex, skin (pigmented), and kidney. Penetration of ruxolitinib 
and ruxolitinib-derived radioactivity into central nervous system tissues was limited (less than 10% of 
plasma concentration). Disappearance of radioactivity was rapid and complete in most tissues in albino 
and pigmented rats. The ruxolitinib-derived radioactivity from skin and uveal tract showed rather long 
elimination half-life but was not irreversibly bound to melanin.  
The tissue distribution of [14C] ruxolitinib-derived radioactivity was assessed in maternal and fetal 
tissues of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. The results indicate that low amounts of drug-
derived radioactivity crossed the placenta and disappeared rapidly from the fetuses, resulting in limited 
fetal exposure. 
Metabolism 
Ruxolitinib is metabolised via Phase I and Phase II reactions and a large number of metabolites were 
identified in all species. The predominant metabolic pathways in mice, rats, dogs, and humans were 
mono- and dioxygenation and in some cases, subsequent glucuronidation. In general, the metabolite 
profiles and excretion patterns in humans were similar to those observed in nonclinical species. In 
humans after a single oral 25 mg dose of [14C] ruxolitinib, parent compound was the predominant 
entity in circulation, representing 57% of the total radioactivity based on AUC. One metabolite was at 
an exposure greater than 10% of the total circulating drug-related material (M18 at 17% based on 
AUC). Other observed ruxolitinib-related components in human plasma were present at exposures less 
than 10% of total radioactivity, and consisted of mono- and di-hydroxylated and ketone metabolites. 
Two minor human metabolites in circulation (M38 and M49) were not previously observed in plasma 
of nonclinical species, but their low circulating exposure in human (less than 3% based on 14C-AUC) is 
well below the threshold that would raise a safety concern.  The animals in the toxicity studies have 
thus been exposed to the major human metabolites. 
Excretion 
In rats, excretion of drug-derived radioactivity was rapid after either a single oral or i.v. dose of [14C] 
ruxolitinib (92% and 87%, respectively, excreted in urine and faeces within 12 h of dosing). Excretion 
in urine, bile, and faeces of bile duct cannulated rats accounted for approximately 50%, 37% and 12% 
of the dose, respectively with a total overall recovery of approximately 100% of administered 
radioactivity within 24h post-dose. Excretion of radioactivity was also rapid in male and female dogs 
after a single oral dose with 80% to 82% of the dose excreted within 24h of dosing. Excretion in urine 
and faeces accounted for 34% to 36% and 55% to 58% of the dose, respectively with a total overall 
recovery of approximately 94% to 96% of administered radioactivity within 96h post-dose. Excretion 
in urine and faeces of humans after a single oral 25 mg dose of [14C] ruxolitinib 
accounted approximately for 74% and 22% of the dose, respectively, with a total overall recovery 
of approximately 96% of administered radioactivity within 144h. Excretion in humans was rapid, with 
greater than 70% of the radioactivity recovered by 24h post-dose. Unchanged ruxolitinib constituted 
less than 3% of the radioactivity in mouse, rat, and human excreta, and approximately 15% in dog, 
also indicative of extensive metabolism, the primary route of elimination.

Excretion to milk was studied in lactating rats. Mean milk: plasma concentration ratios of radioactivity 
were greater than one at all measurable sampling times with a ratio of 13.4 based on AUCinf, 
indicating that ruxolitinib-derived radioactivity preferentially partitions into milk.

Repeat oral dose toxicity studies with ruxolitinib of up to 4 weeks in mice, 6 months in rats, 
and 12 months in the dog were conducted. The findings observed in all of these species were primarily 
those expected that are related to the pharmacological mode of action of the drug and included 
decreases in lymphocytes, eosinophils, reticulocytes, red blood cell, haemoglobin and haematocrit as 
well as hypocellularity of the bone marrow and lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus, lymph nodes). In the 
4-week CByB6F1 mice toxicity study, acute exudative inflammatory changes in nasal cavities at ≥ 175 
mg/kg were noted.  Increase in nasal exudative inflammation (minimal to moderate in severity) was 
also noted in the 26-week carcinogenicity study (12-fold exposure margin to highest clinical dose). No 
such effects have been noted in the clinical studies. 
In the 13- week rat study, minimal heart fibrosis was seen in females at ≥ 150 mg/kg (a dose 
associated with an AUC (91 μM*h) that is 11-fold greater than the AUC at a 25 mg BID clinical dose). 
The fibrous connective tissue replacing cardiac myocytes was primarily affecting the papillary muscles 
at the apex of the heart.  Absence of bronchus associated lymphoid tissue was also noted in individual 
animals.    
In the 6 month rat study, minimal adrenal cortical atrophy in seven of 15 male rats was noted at the 
highest dose administered, 60 mg/kg/day. These microscopic changes were not observed at 
recovery necropsy. The minimal cortical atrophy observed at the end of 6 months treatment, were fully 
reversed after a 6 week recovery period.  
In the 6-month dog study, prostatic hypoplasia/atrophy in male dogs and oestrus/diestrus were noted 
in one mid- and several high dose dogs but not in control animals. All male dogs with prostatic 
hypoplasia/atrophy in the 6 month study had normal testes with active spermatogenesis.  
Demodectic mange, bacterial pneumonia and viral-induced papillomas were seen in the dogs (see 
discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
The mean unbound AUC values associated with nonclinical NOAEL doses compared to those of the 
highest therapeutic dose (25 mg twice daily) are 12-fold higher in Tg.rasH2 mice (26-week 
carcinogenicity study), 16-fold higher in female rats but  approximately 2-fold lower in male rats (6 
month study), and approximately equivalent in dogs (12 month study). Comparisons for mean Cmax 
are similar.

Fertility and early embryonic development was evaluated in rats and showed increases in post-
implantation loss (NOAEL, 10 mg/kg). In embryo-fetal assessments, an increase in late resorptions 
(rabbit only) and reduced fetal weights (rats and rabbits) were noted at the highest and maternally 
toxic dose (NOAEL for the rat and rabbit studies was 30 mg/kg/day).  
In rabbits, an increased number of malformations were noted in animals treated with ruxolitinib but 
not in the control group. Hydrocephaly was noted in one fetus and umbilical hernias were noted in two 
fetuses from separate litters from dams given 60 mg/kg/day. An unossified pubis was also noted in 
one fetus at this high dose. Incidental skeletal malformations included fused ribs in one 10 mg/kg/day 
fetus, fused thoracic centra in two 10 mg/kg/day fetuses from one litter and fused ribs and 
thoracic centrum in one 30 mg/kg/day fetus.

Data presented  are for animals after daily  repeated oral administration at the end of  the dosing for the given studies (Day 176 for 
CByB6F1 Hybrid mouse, Day 28 for CD-1 mouse, Day 181 for rat and Day 357 for dog).  Data for human are extrapolated from dose 
normalized data obtained in myelofibrosis patients following bid dosing [study INCB 18424-251]. 
a: Dose in mg/kg/day represents highest therapeutic dose in myelofibrosis patients and NOAEL in animals 
b: Ratios of exposure in animals to those in patients based on total AUC values.  Ratios based on unbound drug are described in 
[CTD Section 2.4.5.6] 
c: Calculated from total daily dose (50 mg/day) and an approximate mean body weight of 75 kg for myelofibrosis patients in Phase 2 
and Phase 3 studies. 
The mean unbound AUC values associated with nonclinical NOAEL doses compared to those of the 
highest therapeutic dose (25 mg twice daily) are 12-fold higher in Tg.rasH2 mice (26-week 
carcinogenicity study), 16-fold higher in female rats but  approximately 2-fold lower in male rats (6 
month study), and approximately equivalent in dogs (12 month study). Comparisons for mean Cmax 
are similar.  
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies have been conducted since clinical studies with an i.v.  formulation were not 
required to support the proposed indication.

Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
No phototoxicity or photoallergy or irritancy studies have been performed via the oral route 
of administration. In GLP studies with topical administration, at concentrations of up to 10% in the 
liquid vehicle, dimethylformamide, ruxolitinib was negative for skin sensitization potential in the murine 
LLNA. Ruxolitinib cream at concentrations of ≤ 1.5% was also tested in a guinea pig model of 
photoallergy, and was determined to lack both photoallergic and contact hypersensitivity potential. In 
a phototoxicity assay in male albino hairless guinea pigs, no adverse skin reactions and no evidence of 
a phototoxic response were observed following dermal treatment of ruxolitinib cream at concentrations 
of ≤ 1.5% in the presence or absence of solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation. Ruxolitinib was 
considered photoclastogenic in an in vitro assay using CHO cells. 
Chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in the presence of 
ultraviolet light. (T08-02-11) 
In the chromosomal aberrations assay repeat, replicate cultures of CHO cells were treated with 
concentrations of 1.79, 5.00, 10.0, 20.0, 28.6, 30.0, 60.0, 80.0, 120, 160, and 200 μg/mL without and 
with UV exposure. Cultures were harvested 20 hours after the initiation of treatment. Cultures treated 
with 20.0, 28.6, and 60.0 μg/mL without UV light exposure and 1.79, 20.0, 28.6, 30.0, and 60.0 
μg/mL with UV light exposure were analyzed for chromosomal aberrations. Concentrations of ≥ 80 
μg/mL were associated with levels of cytotoxicity that made them unevaluable. No significant increase 
in cells with chromosomal aberrations was observed in the cultures analyzed from the assay without 
UV light exposure. Significant increases in cells with chromosomal aberrations were observed in the 
cultures treated with 28.6, 30.0, and 60.0 μg/mL from the assay with UV light exposure.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No 
The Applicant has conducted an adequate program to elucidate the pharmaco-toxicological properties 
of ruxolitinib. The mechanism of action through the selective inhibition of JAKs seems clear. Based on 
the non-clinical pharmacology data there is support for effect in the intended disease for this 
application.  
The detected adverse effects in safety pharmacology studies are not a cause for major concern due to 
the relatively high exposure margins compared with the highest clinical dose. Adverse decreases in 
blood pressure along with increases in heart rate were noted in a dog telemetry study, and an adverse 
decrease in minute volume was noted in a respiratory study in rats. The margins (based on unbound 
Cmax) at the non-adverse level in the dog and rat studies were 15.7-fold and 10.4-fold greater, 
respectively, than the maximum human recommended dose of 25 mg twice daily. No effects were 
noted in an evaluation of the neuropharmacological effects of ruxolitinib. 
Based on comparative PK characteristics of ruxolitinib the animal species used for toxicology studies 
are considered appropriate.  
A full program of non-clinical toxicity studies has been conducted in appropriate animal species, 
including single and repeat dose toxicity testing, genotoxic and carcinogenicity testing, reproductive 
and developmental studies and phototoxicity. The findings observed in all of these species were 
primarily those expected that are related to the pharmacological mode of action of the drug and 
included decreases in lymphocytes, eosinophils, reticulocytes, red blood cell, haemoglobin and 
haematocrit as well as hypocellularity of the bone marrow and lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus, 
lymph nodes). Notably, the dose limiting toxicity for ruxolitinib in the clinical setting 
is thrombocytopenia, which has not been observed in nonclinical toxicology evaluations.  
Minimal heart fibrosis was seen in rats.  Absence of bronchus associated lymphoid tissue was also 
noted in individual animals.  The absence of heart fibrosis in the dogs and the relatively high exposure 
to ruxolitinib in the rats compared to the clinical dose indicate a low clinical relevance of this finding.  
Reversible minimal adrenal cortical atrophy was noted in rats. Furthermore, as this finding has not 
been reproduced in the ruxolitinib mouse or dog toxicity studies it is considered of low significance. 
Prostatic hypoplasia/atrophy in male dogs and oestrus/diestrus were noted in dogs. Prostate growth 
and development is partially mediated by prolactin and growth hormone, both of which stimulate gene 
transcription via the JAK-STAT pathway. Therefore the effects on the prostate are possibly a 
consequence of the pharmacologic activity of ruxolitinib. All male dogs with prostatic 
hypoplasia/atrophy had normal testes with active spermatogenesis. The minimal finding is likely due to 
sexual immaturity in a small proportion of the dogs after 6 months, and the proportions are too low to 
assess accurately across dose groups. This interpretation is further supported by the data from the 12-
month dog study which confirmed no effect.   
Demodectic mange, bacterial pneumonia and viral-induced papillomas were seen in the dogs. 
Ruxolitinib has immunosuppressive effects which is the most probable cause to the increased incidence 
of infections. The risk for adverse effects occurring in patients due to immunomodulatory effects of 
ruxolitinib has been noted in the SmPC.  
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 24/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In rats and dogs, the exposure margins at NOAL compared to the highest clinical dose are limited by 
the exaggerated pharmacological effects of JAK inhibition. The complete toxicity profiles can therefore 
not be characterised due to these limitations. 
Genotoxicity studies in bacterial in vitro systems and in mammalian in vitro and in vivo systems with 
and without metabolic activation did not reveal any evidence for a mutagenic or clastogenic potential 
for ruxolitinib. Further, six selected impurities demonstrated no evidence of a potential for 
mutagenicity in AMES evaluations (data not shown). 
A 26-week oral (gavage) carcinogenicity study conducted in transgenic mice (Tg.rasH2) has been 
completed. The mouse model selected was considered to be acceptable by CHMP in a Scientific Advice 
(EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/593338/2008. November 20). The Tg.rasH2 mouse model not only responds to a 
range of weak and strong genotoxic carcinogens but it has also demonstrated some sensitivity to non-
genotoxic carcinogens. There was no statistically significant increase in the incidence of neoplasms. 
Exudative inflammation of the nasal cavity in ruxolitinib treated groups resulted in the nasal cavity 
being considered to be a target organ for non-neoplastic inflammatory lesions.  
A 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats is on-going. Considering that ruxolitinib is not genotoxic, not 
carcinogenic in the Tg.rasH2 mice, and noting the absence of preneoplastic lesions in repeated dose 
toxicity studies, and considering the patient population, it is acceptable that the results from the 2-
year carcinogenicity study will be submitted post-approval as suggested. 
Ruxolitinib decreased foetal weight and increased post-implantation loss in animal studies. There was 
no evidence of a teratogenic effect in rats and rabbits. However, the exposure margins compared to 
the highest clinical dose were low and the results are therefore of limited relevance for humans. No 
effects were noted on fertility. In a pre- and post-natal development study, a slightly prolonged 
gestation period, reduced number of implantation sites, and reduced number of pups delivered were 
observed. In the pups, decreased mean initial body weights and short period of decreased mean body 
weight gain were observed. In rabbits, an increased number of malformations were noted. These 
malformations were not observed at the highest dose level. The observed malformations are within 
normal ranges for untreated rabbits. The rabbit study is however inconclusive due to the very low 
exposure margins obtained compared to the clinical use.   
The lack of juvenile toxicity studies is accepted as this application is intended to support an indication 
in adult patients.  
Based on the observed reprotoxic effects, the use of ruxolitinib during pregnancy is not recommended. 
In lactating rats, ruxolitinib and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk with a concentration 
that was 13-fold higher than the maternal plasma concentration. Ruxolitinib may be excreted in human 
milk and because the risk to nursing infants is unknown, ruxolitinib should not be used during breast-
feeding.  
No phototoxicity or photoallergy or irritancy studies have been performed via the oral route 
of administration. The topical/dermal tests for sensitization and phototoxicity are considered relevant 
to assessing the risk of similar reaction following oral drug treatment as the distribution of ruxolitinib 
and its metabolites to skin is similar following oral administration as after topical application. The 
studies indicate a low risk of phototoxic or sensitization reactions of ruxolitinib.  
No immunotoxicity studies have been conducted, which is acceptable considering the known 
immunomodulatory effects of ruxolitinib. 
Ruxolitinib PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Phase II studies are not required. Therefore ruxolitinib is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment.

The applicant claimed the approval for the following indication: 
Jakavi is indicated for treatment of adult patients with myelofibrosis, including primary myelofibrosis 
(also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post 
essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is: 
Jakavi is indicated for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients 
with primary myelofibrosis (also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post polycythaemia vera 
myelofibrosis or post essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Ruxolitinib is a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) class 1 compound, with high 
permeability, high solubility and rapid dissolution characteristics. In clinical studies, ruxolitinib is 
rapidly absorbed after oral administration with maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) achieved 
approximately 1 hour post-dose. Based on a human mass balance study, oral absorption of ruxolitinib, 
as ruxolitinib or metabolites formed under first-pass, is 95% or greater. Mean ruxolitinib Cmax and 
total exposure (AUC) increased proportionally over a single dose range of 5-200 mg. There was no 
clinically relevant change in the pharmacokinetics of ruxolitinib upon administration with a high-fat 
meal. The mean Cmax was moderately decreased (24%) while the mean AUC was nearly unchanged 
(4% increase) on dosing with a high-fat meal. 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution at steady state is 53-65 litres in myelofibrosis patients. At clinically 
relevant concentrations of ruxolitinib, binding to plasma proteins in vitro is approximately 97%, mostly 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 28/84
 
 
 
 
 
to albumin. A whole body autoradiography study in rats has shown that ruxolitinib does not penetrate 
the blood-brain barrier. 
Elimination 
Ruxolitinib is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (>50%) with additional contribution from CYP2C9. Parent 
compound is the predominant entity in human plasma, representing approximately 60% of the drug-
related material in circulation. Two major and active metabolites are present in plasma representing 
25% and 11% of parent AUC. These metabolites have one half to one fifth of the parent JAK-related 
pharmacological activity. The sum total of all active metabolites contributes to 18% of the overall 
pharmacodynamics of ruxolitinib. At clinically relevant concentrations, ruxolitinib does not inhibit 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or hepatic CYP3A4 and is not a potent inducer 
of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 based on in vitro studies. In vitro data indicate that ruxolitinib may 
inhibit intestinal CYP3A4, Pgp and BCRP. 
Ruxolitinib is mainly eliminated through metabolism. The mean elimination half-life of ruxolitinib is 
approximately 3 hours. Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled ruxolitinib in healthy adult 
subjects, elimination was predominately through metabolism, with 74% of radioactivity excreted in 
urine and 22% via faeces. Unchanged parent substance accounted for less than 1% of the excreted 
total radioactivity. Oral clearance has been estimated to approximately 19 L/h.  
The pharmacokinetics is dose and time linear. Thus, there is little or no accumulation under multiple 
dose conditions. Ruxolitinib is eliminated through metabolism.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Data from single and multiple dose studies in healthy volunteers indicate that ruxolitinib exposure was 
linear with respect to dose.  
No significant change in ruxolitinib pharmacokinetics was detected after continuous administration for 
up to 10 days when administered once daily (q.d.) and twice daily (b.i.d). 
Special populations 
The pharmacokinetics of ruxolitinib and metabolites have been studies under single-dose conditions in 
patients with normal, mild, moderate, severe or end-stage renal function impairment. Renal function 
was measured using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) as well as U-creatinine. As expected, 
the (total) exposure of ruxolitinib is not affected by renal impairment (mild to end stage renal disease-
ESRD). However, the exposure of several metabolites is increased, in particular that of M11 and M27.  
The PD effect is prolonged in patients with ESRD and a reduction of the initial dose is proposed as well 
as dosing after dialysis, on dialysis days only. Available data in this population suggest that the 
starting dose for patients with ESRD on haemodialysis is a single dose of 15 mg or 20 mg, to be 
administered after haemodialysis has been completed and only on the day of haemodialysis. A single 
dose of 15 mg is for patients with platelet count between 100,000/mm3 and 200,000/mm3 or a single 
dose of 20 mg for patients with platelet count of >200,000/mm3. Subsequent doses should be 
administered once daily on haemodialysis days following each dialysis session. Dosing only on dialysis 
days applying a dialysis frequency of 3 times a week, is estimated to result in low STAT3 inhibitory 
effect 24-48 hours post dose.  
The rationale is to avoid overexposure of the metabolites. There are no human safety data on the 
higher metabolite exposures and no data on off-target activities which potentially could lead to adverse

effects. With the proposed dosing regimen, the PD effect becomes very low 24-48 (72) hours post dose 
(See figures 1 and 2 below) and there is a risk of insufficient efficacy. Therefore, if needed based on 
efficacy, daily dosing could be applied. However, dose titration needs to proceed carefully, monitoring 
safety and efficacy.

Following a single ruxolitinib dose of 25 mg in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, the 
mean AUC for ruxolitinib was increased in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment 
by 87%, 28% and 65%, respectively, compared to patients with normal hepatic function. There was no 
clear relationship between AUC and the degree of hepatic impairment based on Child-Pugh scores. The 
terminal elimination half-life was prolonged in patients with hepatic impairment compared to healthy 
controls (4.1-5.0 hours versus 2.8 hours). A dose reduction of approximately 50% is recommended for 
patients with hepatic impairment  
In healthy subjects, no significant differences in ruxolitinib pharmacokinetics were observed with 
regard to gender and race. In a population pharmacokinetic evaluation in myelofibrosis patients, no

relationship was apparent between oral clearance and patient age or race. The predicted oral clearance 
was 17.7 l/h in women and 22.1 l/h in men, with 39% inter-subject variability. 
The table below provides the total number of patients enrolled by age group for the development 
programme broken down by PK, controlled, and non-controlled trials.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The applicant has performed a number of in vitro studies on the effects of ruxolitinib on CYP enzymes 
and transport proteins. Induction has been investigated in vitro. PXR mediated induction has been 
investigated in a reporter gene assay, where a clear positive signal was observed. There was no 
induction via CAR and the Ah receptor in vitro. 
In vivo interaction studies have been performed with ketoconazole and erythromycin, rifampicin and 
methotrexate. 
In healthy subjects co-administration of ruxolitinib (10 mg single dose) with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, 
ketoconazole, resulted in ruxolitinib Cmax and AUC that were higher by 33% and 91%, respectively, 
than with ruxolitinib alone. The half-life was prolonged from 3.7 to 6.0 hours with concurrent 
ketoconazole administration.  
In healthy subjects co-administration of ruxolitinib (10 mg single dose) with erythromycin 500 mg 
twice daily for four days (mild or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors) resulted in ruxolitinib Cmax and AUC 
that were higher by 8% and 27%, respectively, than with ruxolitinib alone.  
On the basis of in silico modelling, 50% dose reduction should be considered when using medications 
which are dual inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes such as fluconazole 
Patients should be closely monitored and the dose titrated based on safety and efficacy when CYP3A4 
inducers are administered (such as, but not limited to, avasimibe, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, 
phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin (rifampicin), St.John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) 
In healthy subjects given ruxolitinib (50 mg single dose) following the potent CYP3A4 inducer 
rifampicin (600 mg daily dose for 10 days), ruxolitinib AUC was 70% lower than after administration of 
ruxolitinib alone. The exposure of ruxolitinib active metabolites was unchanged.  
Population PK and PK/PD 
Population PK analysis has been performed for the parent drug. The final model chosen in the 
population PK analysis was a 2 compartment model with linear absorption. Gender was found to be a 
statistically significant covariate on CL/F while bodyweight was a covariate for Vc/F. It appears as the 
individual predictions from the model can be considered reasonably reliable for use in further PKPD 
analyses. The applicant has performed PK/PD analyses related to both efficacy and safety parameters. 
The EC 50s observed for spleen volume were generally roughly similar to the STAT3 EC50s in healthy

volunteers. Looking at spleen volume the EC50 found in patients positive for the JAK2V617F mutation 
was about half the EC 50 in patients negative for the mutation.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ruxolitinib inhibited cytokine-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in whole blood from healthy subjects and 
myelofibrosis patients. Ruxolitinib resulted in maximal inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation 2 hours 
after dosing which returned to near baseline by 8 hours in both healthy subjects and myelofibrosis 
patients, indicating no accumulation of either parent or active metabolites.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Baseline elevations in inflammatory markers associated with constitutional symptoms such as TNFα, 
IL-6 and CRP in subjects with myelofibrosis were decreased following treatment with ruxolitinib. 
Myelofibrosis patients did not become refractory to the pharmacodynamic effects of ruxolitinib 
treatment over time. 
In a thorough QT study in healthy subjects, there was no indication of a QT/QTc prolonging effect of 
ruxolitinib in single doses up to a supratherapeutic dose of 200 mg, indicating that ruxolitinib has no 
effect on cardiac repolarisation. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The phase I studies of ruxolitinib have mainly been performed in healthy volunteers. Population PK 
analysis has been performed in patients. Target effect PD measurements have been performed in 
many of the PK studies by investigating inhibition of cytokine stimulated STAT3 in healthy volunteers.  
With regard to effects on blood pressure and according to a review by the Applicant, JAK1/2 dependent 
cytokines are not expected to play a major role in blood pressure regulation under normal physiologic 
conditions but may affect blood pressure under pathophysiologic conditions characterized by increased 
cytokine expression and enhanced JAK activation. In the case of myelofibrosis, JAK1/2 inhibition might 
be expected to change blood pressure toward levels observed before the onset or the progression of 
disease and before levels of circulating cytokines become increased. If the predominant effect of 
cytokines and increased JAK1/2 signalling is vasodilatory driven by inducing iNOS and excessive nitric 
oxide (NO) production, then JAK1/2 inhibition would be expected to increase blood pressure, in some 
cases unmasking previously elevated blood pressure. By contrast, the net effect of chronic cytokine 
elevation may be to cause vasoconstriction, driven by inhibition of eNOS (causing endothelial 
dysfunction), angiotensin II-AT1 receptor signalling and effects on vascular reactivity and remodelling. 
In such cases, JAK1/2 inhibition could result in a decrease in blood pressure toward normal. The effect 
of JAK1/2 inhibition on blood pressure will be determined by the net balance of its effects on both 
vasodilatory and vasoconstrictor mechanisms. In conclusion, there are mechanistic relationships 
between JAK signalling and inhibition, and blood pressure, however not easily predictable in the 
individual patient. 
Ruxolitinib has pharmacologically active metabolites. The contribution of the metabolites to drug 
efficacy appears quite small. The in vitro activity of the metabolites was investigated using spiked 
whole blood samples. Thus, it may be assumed that the protein binding in the in vitro test was the 
same as in vivo. The applicant has simulated, based on systemic exposure and in vitro activity STAT3 
Jakavi

inhibition, some of the scenarios where this information, and also ex vivo PD data was available. The 
PD response was over predicted in some situations but in general the prediction was reasonable. 
Dose proportionality was demonstrated in the single and multiple dose studies. 
There are limited data to determine the best dosing options for patients with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) on haemodialysis however based on the available data, a proposed dosing regimen is described 
in section 2.4.2 – “special populations” and reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Other dosing regimens may be more suitable from an efficacy perspective. However, due to increased 
metabolite exposure and lack of knowledge on the potential safety consequences of these exposures, 
dose modification should be followed by careful monitoring of safety and efficacy in individual patients. 
The applicant is recommended to provide simulations on the PD-time course obtained with different 
dosing regimens, including daily schedules and potentially b.i.d schedules, attempting to obtain PD 
curves similar to the ones reached in normal renal function. Meanwhile, information regarding daily 
dosing is proposed in the SmPC if proceeding with careful monitoring of safety. 
In patients with any hepatic impairment the recommended starting dose based on platelet count 
should be reduced by approximately 50% to be administered twice daily. Subsequent doses should be 
adjusted based on careful monitoring of safety and efficacy. Patients diagnosed with hepatic 
impairment while receiving ruxolitinib should have complete blood counts, including a white blood cell 
count differential, monitored at least every one to two weeks for the first 6 weeks after initiation of 
therapy with ruxolitinib and as clinically indicated thereafter once their liver function and blood counts 
have been stabilised. Ruxolitinib dose can be titrated to reduce the risk of cytopenia (see sections 4.2, 
4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
No additional dose adjustments are recommended for elderly patients. 
There is no drug interaction study with an oral contraceptive 
Available in vitro data gives a weak indication that ruxolitinib may be a mild inducer of PXR regulated 
enzymes. There is however, no time-dependency in CL observed and the in vitro signal is very weak. 
Therefore, the SmPC does not contain any induction warnings. However, in order to confirm adequate 
contraception due to the teratogenicity considerations, the performance of a DDI study with oral 
contraceptives is included in the RMP (see section 2.7).  
Following concomitant use of ruxolitinib and rifampicin (a potent CYP3A4 inducer), the ruxolitinib 
pharmacodynamic activity was overall similar, suggesting the CYP3A4 induction resulted in minimal 
effect on the pharmacodynamics. However, this could be related to the high ruxolitinib dose resulting 
in pharmacodynamic effects near Emax. It is possible that in the individual patient, an increase of the 
ruxolitinib dose is needed when initiating treatment with a strong enzyme inducer (see section 4.5 of 
the SmPC). 
Based on the results of the interaction studies, when administering ruxolitinib with strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors the unit dose of ruxolitinib should be reduced by approximately 50%, to be administered 
twice daily. Patients should be closely monitored (e.g. twice weekly) for cytopenias and dose titrated 
based on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5). 
No dose adjustment is recommended when ruxolitinib is co-administered with mild or moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, patients should be closely monitored for cytopenias when initiating 
therapy with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
Although ruxolitinib is not a relevant hepatic CYP3A4 inhibitor, it may not be excluded that ruxolitinib 
inhibits CYP3A4 in the intestine. Increased systemic exposure may be found in drugs which are 
metabolised by CYP3A4 and particularly in those undergoing extensive intestinal metabolism. Safety 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 33/84
 
 
 
 
monitoring of the orally administered CYP3A4 metabolised drugs which are extensively metabolised in 
the intestine is therefore advised when combining with ruxolitinib. The interaction is likely to be 
minimized if the time between drug co-administrations is kept apart during the absorption phase (e.g. 
at least 2 hours). 
Ruxolitinib may inhibit P-glycoprotein and BCRP in the intestine. This may result in increased systemic 
exposure of substrates of these transporters such as dabigatran etixilate, cyclosporin, rosuvastatin and 
potentially digoxin. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) or clinical monitoring of the affected drug is 
advised. The potential inhibition of P-gp and BCRP in the intestine can be minimized when staggered 
co-administration of dabigatran etixilate, cyclosporin and rosuvastatin with ruxolitinib is employed. 
The RMP includes performing a drug interaction study with an oral CYP3A4 substrate such as 
midazolam. Besides worst case administration times, the study could include an investigation of 
staggered dosing to support a clear labelling language on how to reduce a possible effect.  
The concurrent use of haematopoietic growth factors and ruxolitinib has not been studied. It is not 
known whether the JAK inhibition by ruxolitinib reduces the efficacy of the haematopoietic growth 
factors or whether the haematopoietic growth factors affect the efficacy of ruxolitinib as reflected in 
sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC. 
The concomitant use of cytoreductive therapies and ruxolitinib has not been studied. The safety and 
efficacy of this co-administration is therefore not known as reflected in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the 
SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The data submitted by the applicant are considered appropriate. However, additional PK studies and 
simulations are proposed to fill information gaps. The lack of data is reflected in the SmPC. 
Simulations supporting an optimized dosing regimen in ESRD are recommended.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
- Due to the concerns regarding potential teratogenicity, and a very weak signal on enzyme induction, 
a study should be performed to confirm lack of interaction with oral contraceptives (see section 2.7 
RMP). 
- Based on in vitro inhibition data and the possible concentrations of ruxolitinib in the enterocyte, it 
may not be certified that ruxolitinib does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, thereby affecting the large number 
of orally administered CYP3A4 substrates. Therefore an in vivo interaction study is needed (see section 
2.7 RMP). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Dose-finding study 18424-251 
This was a multicentre, open-label, non-randomised, dose escalation study of INCB018424 in 154 
subjects ≥18 years with therapy-requiring PMF, PPV-MF, or PET-MF. An interim report that contains 
available data for all subjects through 31 December 2009 with an addendum presenting additional 
survival data through 01 Mar 2011 was included in the application. All analyses were exploratory. 
The disease severity system used (Lille (Dupriez) Scoring System) differed from the one used in the 
Phase 3 studies (IWG criteria; published 2009).  
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 34/84
 
 
 
 
The study was comprised of 3 parts. Part 1 was a dose escalation phase to determine the MTD utilizing 
a bid regimen; with thrombocytopenia as DLT the 25 mg bid dose was confirmed as the MTD. Part 2 
examined 3 alternative dose regimens (qd regimen, low-dose regimen of 10 mg bid, and an 
induction/maintenance regimen consisting of 25 mg bid/10 mg bid).  
Part 3 examined 3 groups of subjects to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of the selected dose 
levels, but also to explore dose selection and modification based on platelet count values as doses of 
10 mg bid and 25 mg bid differed in efficacy but also in the propensity for thrombocytopenia: Subjects 
with baseline platelet count >200,000/μL began administration at 15 mg bid; subjects with baseline 
platelet count ≤200,000/μL began administration at 10 mg bid. For later cohorts, doses were titrated 
based on efficacy and safety to a maximum of 25 mg bid.   
Table 11: Spleen Size Reduction and Incidence of Thrombocypenia at different Doses  
a Only subjects with a palpable spleen at Baseline and at least 1 month of spleen size data are included in the 
spleen reduction analysis. 
Efficacy 
The number on the top of each box is the number of subjects used as the denominator, and the number inside the

Figure 3: Proportion of Subjects with Clinical Improvement (ITT Subjects) 
At Week 12, 33.1% of subjects were assessed as showing clinical improvement, and no subject had 
progressive disease or had relapsed. In general, the proportion of subjects who were assessed as 
showing clinical improvement increased through Week 36 and stayed at this level until Week 60. 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 35/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At Week 24 (6 months of treatment), 43.8% of subjects had a ≥ 50% reduction from Baseline in 
spleen length. At Week 72 (approx 1.5 years of treatment), 23.6% of subjects had a ≥ 50% 
reduction from Baseline in spleen palpation length. 
Patients who initiated dosing at 15 mg bid and had subsequent optimization of treatment showed the 
highest consistent response rate over time. Dosing at the MTD of 25 mg bid resulted in 27.5% grade 
3-4 anaemia and 36.1% grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia with approximately 50% of patients requiring 
dose reductions. 
Table 12: Proportion of Subjects Achieving ≥ 50% Reduction from Baseline in Spleen Palpation Length 
by Visit Based on Initial Treatment (ITT) 
Based on average dose, subjects receiving >10-≤15 mg or >15-≤20 mg bid had larger median percent 
changes from baseline compared with subjects receiving >5-≤10 mg bid. 
The starting dose regimen selected for the phase III studies was 15 and 20 mg bid for patients with 
baseline platelet counts 100,000 – 200,000 and >200,000, respectively. Preliminary evidence of 
efficacy was obtained.

Treatments 
In the ruxolitinib arm, starting dosages of 15 mg and 20 mg bid were selected, with starting dose 
based on baseline platelet count; 100,000 – 200,000 and >200,000, respectively. Doses were 
permitted to be increased by 5 mg bid after 4 weeks of therapy in patients who met all of the following 
conditions: a) Inadequate efficacy was demonstrated by palpable spleen length below the costal 
margin that had been reduced by < 40% at the Week 4 visit relative to baseline. In 352, after Week 
4, dose increases in ruxolitinib were allowed during the Randomized Treatment Phase only for those 
subjects who exhibited an increase in palpable spleen size; b) Platelet count at the Week 4 blood draw 
was > 150,000/μL and platelet count had never been below 150,000/μL at a prior laboratory 
evaluation while receiving ruxolitinib; and c) ANC levels remained at or above 1000/μL since enrolment

• Prednisone, methylprednisone, prednisolone (glucocorticoids) 
• Epoetin alfa, an anti-anaemic preparation 
• Thalidomide, lenalidomide (Immunosuppresants) 
• Mercaptopurine, thioguanine (purine analogs) 
• Danazol, an anti-gonadotropins or similar agent 
• Pegasys and Interferon-α (Interferons) 
• Melphalan (nitrogen mustard analog) 
• Acetylsalicyclic acid (platelet aggregation inhibitor) 
• Colchicine, a preparation with no effect on uric acid metabolism 
BAT  also  included  the  option  of  no  treatment.  BAT  (oral  or  parenteral  therapy)  was  commercially 
available  and  administered  according  to  manufacturer’s  instructions  and  Investigator  discretion.  No 
experimental drugs were permitted during the study. It was recommended that control-group subjects 
who  could  not  maintain  platelet  counts  ≥  50,000/μL  and/or  neutrophils  ≥  500/μL;  or  experienced 
another Grade 4 toxicity during the Randomised Treatment Phase were to either decrease the dose of 
BAT or switch to an alternative treatment approach. 
Study 351 
Placebo was used in the control arm.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 39/84
 
 
 
 
Safety:  
Safety  and  tolerability  was  assessed  by:  monitoring  the  frequency,  duration  and  severity  of  adverse 
events (AEs), performing physical exams, and evaluating changes in vital signs and electrocardiograms 
(ECGs) as well as serum chemistry and haematology results. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
The  concentrations  from  this  study  were  analysed  separately  and  were  used  as  external  validation 
dataset  for  the  population  pharmacokinetic  model  generated  from  pooled  data  from  Studies 
INCB18424-251, INCB018424-351, and CINC424A2352. 
Biomarkers: 
JAK2V617F allele burden was determined for all subjects enrolled in the study. 
Quality of life: 
QoL  was  assessed  in  subjects  using  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  questionnaire  and  FACT-lym  questionnaire. 
Both  of  these  instruments  are  self-administered  questionnaires  used  for  cancer  subjects  in  clinical 
studies and contain functional subscales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social). 
Sample size 
Study 352: 
The sample size of this study was originally calculated based on the primary efficacy variable, the 
proportion of subjects achieving 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline at Week 48. Assuming 
at least 35% of the active subjects would achieve a 35% reduction from baseline to Week 48, and that 
rate for the control subjects would be no more than 10%, a sample size of 150 subjects (100 in active 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 40/84
 
 
 
 
 
and 50 in control) would provide at least 90% power to detect a treatment difference in the primary 
endpoint at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 using the Chi-square test. 
This study planned to enrol approximately 150 subjects. The protocol defined that the study would be 
closed to screening when at least 130 subjects had been enrolled, with 130 plus half of the subjects 
remaining in screening totalling at least 150 subjects. However, a significant increase in screening 
activity resulted in a total randomization level that was higher than anticipated. As a result, the total 
enrolment for the study was 219 subjects. 
Study 351: 
In order to provide a large safety database and adequate power for secondary efficacy variables, 240 
subjects were planned to be randomized using a 1:1 ratio of ruxolitinib to placebo. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is the proportion of subjects achieving >35% reduction in 
spleen volume from Baseline to Week 24. It was assumed that at least 30% of the active subjects 
would achieve a >35% reduction from baseline to Week 24, and that rate for the placebo subjects 
would be no more than 10%. Under this assumption, a sample size of 240 subjects (120 per group) 
would provide a 97% power to detect a treatment difference in the primary endpoint at two-sided 
alpha level of 0.05 using the chi-square test. 
This study planned to enrol approximately 240 subjects. Based on the study’s screen fail rate, it was 
projected that it would be necessary to screen approximately 330 subjects to enrol 240. An estimate of 
the last day for screening was produced, targeting a total of 330 subjects screened to achieve 240 
subjects enrolled. However, the screening rate increased considerably from that expected, resulting in 
a total of 476 patients being screened. As a result, the total enrolment for the study was 309 patients. 
Randomisation 
There  was  a  block  randomization  with  a  block  size  of  six,  stratified  by  prognostic  category  of 
Intermediate (2 risk factors) or High risk (3 or more risk factors). The randomization list was created 
by StatWorks under Incyte responsibility using a validated SAS® program. This program generated the 
final  randomization  list.  This  list  was  provided  to  the  IVRS  provider  (Clarix)  to  be  used  for  patient 
randomization in one of the two treatment arms (Ruxolitinib or best available therapy). 
Blinding (masking) 
Study: 352 
This was an open-label study. 
The primary endpoint for this study was based on the change in splenic volume by independent central 
review of MRI or CT scans; these results were not provided to Investigators unless the subject reached 
an endpoint of 25% increase in spleen volume relative to the on-study nadir (including baseline). 
Images were read and measured by an external radiologist (an independent central reviewer) who was 
blinded to treatment assignment. 
Study: 351 
Subjects, Investigators, and the Sponsor remained blinded to the initial treatment assignment until the 
database was frozen and the primary data analysis was complete. Individual subject unblinding 
occurred if the subject had worsening symptomatic or asymptomatic spleen growth and qualified for 
early crossover or needed to be unblinded for safety reasons.

Statistical methods 
Study: 352 
The primary analysis for this study was conducted when all enrolled subjects completed Week 48 or 
were withdrawn from the study. Efficacy and safety results for the primary analysis were based on the 
Randomized Treatment Phase up to the time the last randomized subject had completed the Week 48 
visit. For subjects who were eligible to enter the Extension Phase due to disease progression, the data 
captured were reported in the listings and flagged as having been collected in the Extension Phase 
(exceptions were LFS and OS, which were analyzed regardless of phase). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects in the FAS who achieved ≥ 35% 
reduction in spleen volume from baseline at Week 48. Subjects without an evaluable spleen volume 
assessment at baseline were excluded from the primary analysis. The key secondary efficacy endpoint 
was defined as the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline 
at Week 24. Other secondary efficacy endpoints were the duration of maintenance of a ≥ 35% 
reduction from baseline in spleen volume, the time to achieve a first ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume 
from baseline, PFS, LFS, OS, and bone marrow histomorphology. In addition, supportive efficacy 
analyses included those on the PP set and on subgroups. 
Confidence intervals (CIs) for response rate were calculated as exact binomial CIs. The two proportions 
were compared using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by prognostic category 
(Intermediate-2 or High). In the event that the proportion of one group was less than 4%, the exact 
CMH test was used instead. 
Subjects experiencing a protocol-defined progression qualifying event prior to the Week 48 visit were 
considered as failures regardless of the spleen volume. 
Missing values were not imputed. A subject was required to have a baseline spleen volume 
measurement to be included in the primary efficacy analysis. A subject with a missing Week 48 spleen 
volume measurement was considered as not having achieved the ≥ 35% reduction. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed using the PP set and on all subjects in the FAS considering 
subjects without baseline spleen volume measurement as failures. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was also analysed using a logistic regression model with baseline spleen 
volume and treatment as the model effects and adjusted to baseline prognostic category. The odds 
ratio with a 95% CI of achieving ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume was presented. 
Another logistic regression model was fitted with baseline spleen volume, gender (male or female), MF 
type (PMF, PPV-MF or PET-MF), baseline prognostic category (Intermediate-2 or High), previous HU 
use, platelet count and treatment (active or control) as the model effects. This analysis produced the 
odds ratio with 95% CI of active vs. control after adjusting for the covariates. 
The percent change from baseline at Week 48 was analyzed in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with baseline and treatment as the model effects for a between-group comparison. 
Study 351 
The proportion of subjects achieving ≥35% reduction in spleen volume from Baseline to Week 24 was 
calculated by treatment group. The two proportions were to be compared using the Chi-squared test. 
Per the SAP, the Chi Square test was replaced by Fisher’s Exact test because of the low proportion of 
responders in one group. 
This analysis was also conducted in the per-protocol population. 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 42/84
 
 
 
 
No imputation for missing data was performed. Subjects with missing Baseline values were excluded 
from analyses where a change from Baseline was calculated or when the Baseline was used as a 
covariate. A subject with a missing Week 24 spleen volume were considered as having not achieved 
the >35% reduction. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was also analyzed using a logistic regression model with Baseline spleen 
volume, sex (male or female), MF disease sub-type (PMF, PPV-MF or PET-MF), hydroxyurea usage in 
the 3 months prior to entering the study, and treatment (active or control) as the model effects. This 
analysis produced the p-value of treatment effect and the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval of 
active versus control after adjusting for the covariates. 
The percent change from Baseline to Week 24 was analyzed using both parametric and non-parametric 
methods. The Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test was used for a between-group comparison in the median 
percent change from Baseline, and a linear model with Baseline and treatment as the model effects 
were used for a between-group comparison in the mean percent change from Baseline.

Recruitment 
Study 352: 
Study initiation date: 01-Jul-2009 (first subject first visit). Data cut-off date: 04-Jan-2011 (last subject 
last visit). The Randomized Treatment and Extension Phases are ongoing; the maximum duration 
of treatment at the end of the trial will not exceed 171 weeks for any subject consisting of 
an enrolment period of 27 weeks + 48 weeks before primary analysis + 96 weeks after LSLV for the 
primary endpoint. After Protocol Amendment 3, subjects who consented were followed for OS, LFS, 
and new anti-neoplastic therapy until the study was concluded. Survival information will be collected 
until the LSLV of the Extension Phase. 
Study 351: 
Study initiation date: 24-Aug-2009. Data cut-off date: 02-Nov-2010. The study is ongoing. Subjects 
receiving benefit could continue treatment until the later of marketing approval or when the last 
randomized subject remaining in the study had completed Week 144 (36 months). 
Conduct of the study 
Study 352: 
The study protocol was amended five times. Important changes were:  
o  The duration of study treatment for the Randomized Treatment and Extension Phases 
was clarified 
o  Removal of the protocol-planned interim analysis at the time of the New Drug Application filing 
to the Food and Drug Administration  
o  Modification of the current definition of duration of response  
o  Classified secondary efficacy endpoints as “key” and “other”. 
o  Permitted all BAT subjects to receive ruxolitinib and move to the Extension Phase of the study 
after demonstration of superiority for the primary or key secondary endpoints and provided 
ruxolitinib continued to show an acceptable safety profile 
o  Required subjects to discontinue from the Extension Phase if an increase in spleen volume of at 
least 25% was observed as compared to: Baseline spleen volume, if they were randomized to 
ruxolitinib or, Spleen volume at crossover if they were randomized to BAT 
o  Elimination of the requirement for a maximum dose of ruxolitinib to be 5 mg bid less than the 
dose which caused a platelet count reduction < 100,000/μL  
This study planned to enrol approximately 150 subjects. However total randomization level were higher 
than anticipated. The Sponsor did not feel it was ethical to prohibit screened subjects who met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for randomization to the study. As a result, the total enrolment for the 
study was 219 subjects. 
Protocol deviations 
Overall, major protocol deviations were reported in a total of 17 subjects (7.8%).  
The predominant protocol deviations in the ruxolitinib treatment arm were: • Use of prohibited 
concomitant medications (HU, interferon, thalidomide, busulfan, lenalidomide, or anagrelide) (6 
subjects) • Unconfirmed diagnosis of PMF, PPV-MF, PET-MF (5 subjects). 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 45/84
 
 
 
 
The most common protocol deviations in the BAT treatment arm were: • Crossover of BAT subjects 
into the ruxolitinib treatment arm without meeting the protocol definition of disease progression (6 
subjects) • Change in therapy after baseline MRI and before start of study drug (1 subject) • Subjects 
without a palpable spleen volume ≥5 cm (1 subject) 
Study 351: 
The original protocol was amended 3 times but the study was initiated and all patients enrolled under 
the last amendment. The study was analysed per protocol. 
The meta-analysis of overall survival originally noted in the SAP was not conducted. This was agreed to 
by the FDA at the pre-NDA meeting. 
Protocol deviations 
Fourteen subjects were excluded from the per-protocol population because of violations 
of inclusion/exclusion criteria (8 subjects in the ruxolitinib group and 6 subjects in the placebo group).  
Minor deviations in prior MF therapy wash-out duration or deviations with respect to prior treated 
malignancy within 5 years were noted in 7 subjects.  
Baseline data 
Table 14: Baseline demographic characteristics in Studies INCB 351 and 352 (full analysis set) 
Differences include age, with a higher proportion of patients > 65 years of age in the placebo arm 
(66.2%) than in the ruxolitinib arm (54.8%) in Study INCB 18424-351.

Table 15: Baseline disease characteristics in Studies 351 and 352 (full analysis set) 
In Study 351, the mean duration since initial diagnosis was 4.8 years. In this study, patients were not 
stratified by baseline disease characteristics. 
In Study 352, the mean duration since initial diagnosis was 31.1 months and 33.2 months in the 
ruxolitinib and BAT arms, respectively. In this study, patients were stratified by baseline IWG-MRT risk 
category.

The populations in Studies 351 and 352 differed with regard to their previous treatment for MF. 
(Patients in Study 351 had to be resistant or refractory to, intolerant of, or not candidates for available 
therapy for MF. In Study 352, patients could not be candidates for stem cell transplantation, did not 
need to have failed previous therapies, could have been candidates for available therapy, or could have 
no adequate therapeutic options. For patients in Study 352 with no adequate therapeutic options, BAT 
could include no pharmacologic therapy).

An analysis of data at week 24 in the 352 study, a secondary endpoint, showed that 46 patients 
(31.9%) of patients in the ruxolitinib arm reached the cut-off at that time point. Considering the longer 
median duration of the disease and a situation with lack of alternative therapy for patients in the 
ruxolitinib arm in the 351 study, a higher response rate as compared to the patients in the 352 study 
is unexpected. 
For patients who remained on study, the median percent reduction from baseline in spleen volume in 
both ruxolitinib arms was approximately 30%, was reached at Week 12 and was maintained 
throughout the study. The control arms had a median relative increase from baseline in spleen volume 
throughout the study. 
Figure 4: Waterfall plot of percent change from baseline in spleen volume at Week 48 in Study 352 
The waterfall analyses confirm the efficacy and show that the majority of, albeit not all, patients in the 
ruxolitinib arms achieved some level of spleen volume reduction, which was not the case in neither the 
placebo arm nor the BAT arm. It is also clear from the study 351 data that patients may achieve 
spleen volume reductions spontaneously. 
Secondary endpoints 
  Duration of response 
Updated duration of response using method 1 (the primary analysis method specified in Study 351) 
and method 2 (the primary analysis method specified in Study 352) is shown below. 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report

Table 18: Duration of response in studies INCB 18424-351 (data cutoff 01 March 2011) and 
CINC424A2352 (data cutoff 01 June 2011) FAS 
With Method 1, the median duration of response has not been reached for any of the studies.  
With Method 2 (loss of response is the date of observation of < 35% reduction from baseline that was 
also ≥ 25% increase from nadir), the updated median duration of maintenance of ≥ 35% reduction of 
spleen volume on Study 351 is 48 weeks. The updated median duration of maintenance of response in 
study 352 has not been reached. 
 
Time to first at least 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline in Study INC424A2352 
Table 19: Time to first at least 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline in Study INC424A2352 
The median time to response coincides with the first MRI assessment at Week 12. 
 
Progression free survival in Study INC424A2352 
Progression was defined as increase of spleen volume of at least 25% compared with on-study nadir, 
splenectomy, splenic irradiation, leukemic transformation, or death. The most common progression 
event was increase in spleen volume of at least 25% from nadir, seen in 40 patients (27.4%) on 
ruxolitinib and 13 patients (17.8%) on BAT. 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 50/84
 
 
 
 
  
 
Updated PFS in the 352 study is shown below. 
Table 20: Progression free survival in study CINC424A2352 (data cutoff 01 June 2011) (FAS) 
There was no statistically significant difference between treatment arms in the updated PFS analysis.  
Data are not mature and cross over to ruxolitinib is likely to confound further follow-up. 
  Overall survival, leukaemia-free survival, and progression-free survival (the latter analysed in 
study 352 only) 
Updated OS data are shown below. 
Table 21: Overall survival in studies INCB 18424-351 (data cutoff 01 March 2011) and CINC424A2352 
(data cutoff 01 June 2011) (FAS) 
The currently available overall survival results from both studies, with a data cut-off date of 
01/03/2011, shows a nominal improvement in overall survival in patients treated with ruxolitinib in the 
study 351, but no difference in the study 352. Further analyses of the study 352 data with a cut-off 
date of 01/06/2011 shows a nominal improvement in overall survival in patients treated with 
ruxolitinib, compared to the control treatment. None of these results reached formal statistical 
significance due to the low number of events in the treatment and control arms in both studies. 
Further follow-up data is likely to be confounded due to the crossover of patients treated in the control 
arms to the ruxolitinib arms. 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 51/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
Updated data on LFS and OS are quite similar because the number of events is identical (all events 
were deaths) with the differences between the two statistical analyses mostly related to the times at 
which patients are censored. There were no cases of leukaemia reported in the clinical database of 
study 352, although two cases of patients on BAT who discontinued were described as having 
leukocytosis and peripheral blood blasts above 20%. 
  Change in density of fibrosis in studies INCB 18424-351 and INC424A2352 as measured by the 
investigators 
This was a secondary endpoint in study 352 and an exploratory endpoint in study 351.  
Improvement as well as worsening of bone marrow fibrosis was seen among the relatively few 
ruxolitinib-treated patients with both baseline and follow-up investigator-assessed bone marrow 
specimens. Conclusions cannot be made on this important issue with the present material and further 
vigilance is indicated. 
  Symptom response rates in Study INCB 18424-351 
Symptoms of MF were assessed using a symptom diary, MSAF v2.0. The total symptom score for 
baseline and on-study time periods was calculated based on the 6 symptom scores of night sweats, 
itching, abdominal discomfort, pain under ribs on left, feeling of fullness (early satiety), and 
muscle/bone pain. 
o  The proportion of patients who achieved a ≥ 50% improvement from baseline in the Week 
24 total symptom score was a secondary endpoint; a statistically significantly larger 
proportion of patients in the ruxolitinib arm achieved a ≥ 50% improvement from baseline 
in Week 24 total symptom score compared with the placebo arm (45.9% and 5.3%, 
respectively, p < 0.0001 from Chi-Square test). The median time to 50% reduction in 
total symptom score was less than 4 weeks among patients achieving this level of 
improvement. 
o  The change from baseline in the Week 24 total score was also a secondary endpoint; a 
median improvement of 6.9 in the ruxolitinib arm and a median worsening of 2.0 in 
the placebo arm (p < 0.0001 from the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test) was seen. This represents 
a mean and median percent improvement from baseline of 46.1% and 56.2% in the 
ruxolitinib arm and a mean and median percent worsening of 41.8% and 14.6% in the 
placebo arm, respectively. 
o  Results per JAK2 mutational group: Percent of subjects achieving greater than or equal to 
50% reduction in total symptom score (TSS) from baseline to week 24, median percent 
improvement from baseline at week 24 in TSS, and median time to first greater than or 
equal to 50% improvement from baseline in TSS were all in favour of the JAK2 positive 
group; 52.3% vs 28.2% in the JAK2 negative group, 65.1% vs 29.4%, and 4.0 vs 6.6 
weeks (here a high number of censored patients is noted in the mutation negative group), 
respectively. 
The symptom score instrument is stated to have been validated for patients with MF and MPN, but the 
validation process is not entirely clear. 
Using the EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument, at week 24 the ruxolitinib group showed significant 
improvement in the global health status and functional subscales compared with the placebo group, 
with the exception of cognitive functioning. For each of the subscales, the ruxolitinib group had an 
improvement from baseline, whereas the placebo group had a worsening from baseline. In the 351 
study, the mean change for the global health status/quality of life score was +12.3 and -3.4 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 52/84
 
 
 
 
(p<0.0001) for Jakavi and placebo, respectively. However, The EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument has not 
been validated in MF patients. 
Assessment of symptom and QoL data obtained in the 352 study is inherently difficult as the study was 
open-designed. In the 351 study, the situation is complicated by the potential problem of maintaining 
the blind when typical active-drug side effects are commonly seen, such as thrombocytopenia.  
However, the credibility of the positive effects observed in these parameters is supported by 
pharmacodynamic data showing decreased levels of pSTAT3 and inflammation markers in peripheral 
blood during treatment with active drug. 
Ancillary analyses 
Exploratory endpoints 
 
JAK2V617F allele burden in Studies INCB 18424-351 and INC424A2352 
Ruxolitinib seems to slightly – modestly decrease the JAK2V617F allele burden in the treated 
population; -10.9% at week 24 (n=101) and -21.5% at week 48 (n=13) in the 351 study, and -
9.3% (n=76) at week 24 and -9.5% (n=60) at week 48 in the 352 study.  
Subgroup analyses 
The results of the subgroup analyses indicate a better response to ruxolitinib in patients starting at 20 
mg BID vs 15 mg BID, and in patients carrying the V617F mutation. 
Subgroup analyses in the 351 study are shown below.

In the subgroup analyses of the study 351, but not in the study 352, a relatively distinct higher 
response rate is seen for females over males at week 24 in the ruxolitinib arm. 
The result of the primary efficacy analysis is supported by the subgroup analyses.

* 
One patient was not included in the analysis due to a missing baseline spleen

**  This study was not designed to rigorously assess the time to response, as the 
first MRI spleen assessment was not performed until Week 12. 
***  This study was not designed or powered for a robust analysis of overall survival, 
and in fact, the number of events in each treatment group was too low for a 
meaningful statistical comparison.

Notes 
* 
One subject was not included in the analysis due to a missing baseline MRI 
measurement of spleen volume. 
**  Duration of response was defined where the start date was the first spleen 
volume measurement that was ≥35% reduction from baseline, and the end date 
was defined as the first scan that was no longer equal to a 35% reduction and 
that was a >25% increase over nadir. 
***  The study was not powered to detect any statistically significant differences in 
# 
these secondary time-to-event endpoints. 
Eleven subjects (7.5%) in the ruxolitinib treatment arm improved in baseline 
fibrosis grade as compared to 2 subjects (2.7%) in the BAT arm; more 
ruxolitinib-treated subjects were reported with a worsening in fibrosis density 
than BAT-treated subjects (11.0% vs. 4.1%, respectively). However, it is 
difficult to make assessments as to whether or not fibrosis scores improve, 
worsen, or remain relatively stable over this period of time. Therefore, the shift 
table of data has not been presented here, within the ‘results & analysis’ section. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The results of two pivotal studies, 351 performed in US, Canada, and Australia and 352 performed in 
EU, are submitted together with results of the supportive dose-finding study 251. The 351 study was 
double-blinded placebo-controlled while the 352 study was open and controlled by investigator’s best 
choice of available therapy. Cross-over was allowed in both studies. The studies recruited from 
different patient populations in that subjects eligible for the 351 protocol were to be without available 
treatment options while this was not the case in the 352 study. The principal primary endpoint, the 
proportion of subjects achieving a ≥35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume by independent 
review, was shared by both studies but analysed after 24 weeks in 351 and after 48 weeks in 352; the 
primary endpoint of the 351 study corresponded to a secondary endpoint of the 352 study. Other 
secondary endpoints included duration of response, overall survival, symptom evaluation (exploratory 
in 352), and leukaemia-free survival (exploratory in 351). 
Thus, the design of the 352 study adheres to the scientific advice given by CHMP. The 351 study would 
have been difficult to continue for a longer period of time with maintained blinding and the different 
designs of the pivotal studies are considered additive and acceptable. However, due to the partly 
different patient populations enrolled, direct comparison of ruxolitinib-related outcomes between the 
studies is hampered. The patient population in both studies are representative of the target population. 
Both pivotal studies recruited more patients than pre-planned. No protocol amendments or violations 
are identified that would substantially impact on the efficacy analyses and conclusions. Hence, the 
studies are considered to have been generally well-conducted. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For the primary efficacy variable, superiority of the ruxolitinib arm over comparator was shown with 
high statistical significance (p<0.0001) in both pivotal studies; in study 351, 65 (41.9%) and 1 (0.7%) 
subjects reached this endpoint at week 24 in the ruxolitinib and placebo arm, respectively; in study 
352, 41 (28.5%) and 0 patients reached this endpoint at week 48 in the ruxolitinib and BAT arm, 
respectively. The consistency of these results is supported by secondary and additional response 
analyses.  
The median duration of response was 48 weeks in the 351 study but still not reached in the 352 study. 
Thus, further information is expected to become available.  
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 59/84
 
 
 
 
 
The subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint in both pivotal studies indicate that patients harbouring 
the JAK2V617F mutation have a higher response rate than patients lacking the mutation. A higher 
response rate was also seen in patients treated with a starting dose of 20 mg bid as compared to 15 
mg bid. 
The subgroup analyses of the 351 study, but not of the 352 study, also indicate a relatively distinct 
higher response rate for females over males at week 24 in the ruxolitinib arm.  
Assessment of symptom and QoL data obtained in the 352 study is inherently difficult as the study was 
open-designed. In the 351 study, the situation is complicated by the potential problem of maintaining 
the blind when typical active-drug side effects are commonly seen, such as thrombocytopenia. 
However, the credibility of the positive effects observed in these parameters is supported by 
pharmacodynamic data showing decreased levels of pSTAT3 and inflammation markers in peripheral 
blood during treatment with active drug. 
Currently available updated overall survival data shows, although not statistically significant, an 
improvement in overall survival with the use of ruxolitinib over placebo/best available therapy; and no 
difference in progression free survival between ruxolitinib and best available therapy. However, data 
are immature and solid conclusions on overall survival, progression-free survival, and leukaemia-free 
survival are currently not allowed. 
Improvement as well as worsening of bone marrow fibrosis was seen among the relatively few 
ruxolitinib-treated patients with both baseline and follow-up investigator-assessed bone marrow 
specimens. Conclusions cannot be made on this important issue with the available data and further 
vigilance is indicated. This will be further characterised with the provision of annual updates of the 
extension phases of studies INCB 18424-351 and INC424A2352 (see obligation to complete post-
authorisation measures) and in the non Interventional Ruxolitinib in Myelofibrosis - Long term Safety 
Study CINC424AIC01T (see RMP). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The application is supported by two well-conducted controlled studies. Superiority of ruxolitinib over 
placebo and best available therapy in terms of ≥35% reduction of spleen volume from baseline is 
shown with high statistical significance. Significant improvements in symptom score and QoL were 
noted in the 351 study. Superior results in terms of spleen volume reduction as well as symptom relief 
were achieved in the JAK2 mutation positive group. Bone marrow fibrosis is to be included in the RMP. 
Updates regarding duration of response, PFS, LFS and OS would further contribute to the benefit-risk 
balance and are considered as a condition to be included in Annex II of the marketing authorisation.

Summary of exposure data: 
In the Phase 3 population, overall exposure to ruxolitinib was 238.7 patient years. A majority of 
patients (55.8%) were treated for at least 9 months. The median duration of exposure to ruxolitinib 
was 9.6 months (range: 0.49-17.25).  
In the MF population, overall exposure to ruxolitinib was 448.8 patient years. In total, 291 (57.2%) 
patients were treated for at least 9 months. The median duration of exposure to ruxolitinib was 10.5 
months (range: 0.03-30.19).

In the All cancer population, overall exposure to ruxolitinib was 552.8 patient years. In total 360 
(58.4%) patients were treated for at least 9 months. The median duration of exposure to ruxolitinib 
was 10.8 months (range: 0.03-30.19). 
The overall median dose intensity was 30 mg/day in all three Safety populations. 
The median duration of exposure in all three pooled safety populations was around 10 months. In the 
phase 1-2 Study 251 longer duration of exposure was seen, but the relevance of the safety data from 
this study is difficult to assess due to the different dosing regimens and higher doses.  
In the combined pivotal studies, 75% of the patients in the ruxolitinib arms were still receiving the 
randomised treatment at data cut-off, indicating that a significantly longer duration of exposure can be 
expected than that for which safety data is currently available. This is considered an important lack of 
long-term safety data, which is particularly important since this is First-in-class substance, which 
involves central parts of the immune and haematopoietic systems in ways not yet fully elucidated.  
Dose reductions/interruptions 
The most frequently reported AEs requiring dose reduction or interruption in ruxolitinib-treated 
patients were thrombocytopenia (34.9%), platelet count decreased (7.6%) and anaemia (5.3%). All 
other AEs requiring dose reduction or interruption occurred with a frequency of 1% or less in 
ruxolitinib-treated patients. These haematological AEs are a direct consequence of the JAK1 and JAK2 
inhibition and AEs appear manageable with dose adjustments and/or transfusions.

The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were thrombocytopenia and anaemia which are 
dose dependent and a direct result of ruxolitinib’s mechanism of action, JAK inhibition.  
In the phase 3 clinical studies, in patients who developed grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median 
time to onset was approximately 8 weeks. Thrombocytopenia was generally reversible with dose 
reduction or dose interruption. The median time to recovery of platelet counts above 50,000/mm3 was 
14 days. Platelet transfusions were administered to 4.7% of patients receiving ruxolitinib and to 4.0% 
of patients receiving control regimens. Discontinuation of treatment because of thrombocytopenia 
occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving ruxolitinib and 0.9% of patients receiving control regimens. 
Patients with a platelet count of 100,000/mm3 to 200,000/mm3 before starting ruxolitinib had a 
higher frequency of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia compared to patients with platelet count 
>200,000/mm3 (64.2% versus 38.5%). 
In phase 3 clinical studies, median time to onset of first CTCAE grade 2 or higher anaemia was 
1.5 months. One patient (0.3%) discontinued treatment because of anaemia. In patients receiving 
ruxolitinib mean decreases in haemoglobin reached a nadir of approximately 10 g/litre below baseline 
after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy and then gradually recovered to reach a new steady state that was 
approximately 5 g/litre below baseline. This pattern was observed in patients regardless of whether 
they had received transfusion during therapy. In the randomised, placebo-controlled study COMFORT-I 
60.6% of ruxolitinib -treated patients and 37.7% of placebo-treated patients received red blood cell 
transfusions during randomised treatment. In the COMFORT-II study the rate of packed red blood cell 
transfusions was 53.4% in the ruxolitinib arm and 41.1% in the best available therapy arm. 
Similarly, erythropenia/anaemia caused dose reduction in 5%, but hardly any discontinuations. 
In the phase 3 clinical studies, in patients who developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, the median time to 
onset was 12 weeks. Dose holding or reductions due to neutropenia were reported in 1.0% of patients, 
and 0.3% of patients discontinued treatment because of neutropenia. 
Increased frequencies of infection AEs may also be directly related to the JAK inhibition by 
inhibiting/hampering the cytokine signalling of the immune response. Infections were overall more 
common in the ruxolitinib arms compared with controls in the pivotal studies, with AE frequencies in 
the SOC group Infections and infestations were 38.1 vs. 41.7% in the ruxolitinib and placebo arms of 
study 351, respectively; and 63.7 vs. 42.5% in the ruxolitinib and BAT arms of Study 352, 
respectively. The pooled frequency of the ruxolitinib arms was 50.5%. It appears that while infection 
AEs overall occur more often in the ruxolitinib arms, Grade 3-4 infections occur at similar frequencies 
as in the placebo and best available therapy arms.  
When all infections in the urinary tract system were grouped together, a prominent difference between 
treatment arms was seen, but no relevant difference between ruxolitinib and control arms was seen 
with regard to SAEs or grade 3-4 “UTI grouped terms”. No discontinuation due to an UTI grouped term 
occurred in the ruxolitinib arms. 
One case of tuberculosis occurred in a ruxolitinib treated patient in Study 352. With prolonged follow-
up, up to September 2011, a total of three reports of tuberculosis during ruxolitinib treatment have 
been received from the two pivotal trials. No reports have been received for patients treated with 
comparator. 
The frequency of Herpes zoster (shingles) was higher in the ruxolitinib arms (3.3%) compared with the 
control arms (0.4%, pooled) of the pivotal studies. The frequency of SAE (0.3%) and Grade 3 (also 
0.3%) events was low. Sequelae in the form of Grade 1-2 post herpetic neuralgia was also seen in 
0.3% (1 patient) in the pivotal studies.

Bleeding and bruising may at least in some cases be a consequence of the haematological side effects 
(thrombocytopenia).  
In the phase 3 pivotal studies bleeding events (including intracranial and gastrointestinal, bruising and 
other bleeding events) were reported in 32.6% of patients exposed to Jakavi and 23.2% of patients 
exposed to the reference treatments (placebo or best available therapy). The frequency of grade 3-4 
events was similar for patients treated with Jakavi or reference treatments (4.7% versus 3.1%). Most 
of the patients with bleeding events during the treatment reported bruising (65.3%). Bruising events 
were more frequently reported in patients taking Jakavi compared with the reference treatments 
(21.3% versus 11.6%). Intracranial bleeding was reported in 1% of patients exposed to Jakavi and 
0.9% exposed to reference treatments. Gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 5.0% of patients 
exposed to Jakavi compared to 3.1% exposed to reference treatments. Other bleeding events 
(including events such as epistaxis, post-procedural haemorrhage and hematuria) were reported in 
13.3% of patients treated with Jakavi and 10.3% treated with reference treatments. 
GI AEs were all of similar frequency as in the placebo arm, but considerably higher than in the BAT 
arm. 
Weight gain was seen clearly more often in the ruxolitinib arms compared with the control arms of the 
pivotal studies; 9.0% vs. 1.3% in the placebo arm of Study 351; and 11.0% vs. 1.4% in the BAT arm 
of Study 352. Grade 3-4 events were seen in similar frequencies, however 0.7% vs. 0.7% in Study 
351, and 2.1% vs.0% in Study 352. One SAE was seen in the ruxolitinib arm of Study 352 (see 
discussion of clinical safety).  
Serious adverse event and deaths 
The overall frequency of SAEs was essentially similar across treatment arms in the pivotal studies, 
around 30%. Apart from anaemia and pneumonia at about 4% each, all other SAEs in the ruxolitinib 
arms occurred at the 1 % level or lower. 
A non-trivial proportion of deaths were due to infections in both the ruxolitinib arm and the placebo 
arm of Study 351. Additional deaths due to infection are seen after cross-over to ruxolitinib in both 
pivotal studies, and in the supportive studies (see discussion on clinical safety).  
There were three cases of bleeding with fatal outcome in the ruxolitinib arms of the pooled pivotal 
studies, compared with one in the control arms. The three events were subdural haemorrhage 
occurring in association with a platelet count of 70K/mm3; post-operative retroperitoneal bleeding 
while on ASA; and cerebral haemorrhage in a setting of progressive metastatic squamous cell 
carcinoma with portal vein thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation and 
thrombocytopenia. In the first case, the thrombocytopenia was considered related to ruxolitinib 
treatment and thereby contributory to the subdural haematoma. In the latter two cases the bleeding 
events were considered unrelated to ruxolitinib treatment.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Decreased laboratory values were seen more often in the ruxolitinib arms than the comparator arms in 
the pivotal studies for haemoglobin, leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets. This included relatively 
large differences also in grade 3 and 4 abnormal values for these parameters, particularly for 
haemoglobin and platelets. However, no difference was seen with regard to lymphocytes.

Total = number of patients who had missing or less than grade x at baseline and with at least one post-baseline value 
for the parameter. 
n = number of patients who had missing or less than grade x at baseline, and worsened to grade x post-baseline. 
Patients are counted only for the worst grade observed post-baseline. 
‘New’ means ‘grade 0’ at baseline and ‘≥ grade 1’ after baseline 
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value prior to the first dose. 
The risk of developing grade 3 or 4 decreased haemoglobin in the pivotal studies increased significantly 
with the baseline grade of haemoglobin, from 30-35% in patients with baseline anaemia of grade 1 to 
nearly 80% in those with grade 2.  Similarly the risk of developing a grade 3 or 4 decreased platelet 
count increased with the baseline grade of platelets, from 10 and 7% in patients with baseline 
thrombocytes of grade 0, to 35 and 17% in those with grade 1, in Study 351 and 352,respectively.  
The need for blood transfusions is a measurable consequence of anaemia. This was higher in the 
ruxolitinib arms compared with the comparator arms, approximately 50-60% vs. 40%. This difference 
is, however, lower than the difference between arms in decreased haemoglobin values, where a 30-
40% difference were seen for any grade, and 20% differences were seen for grade 3 values. No 
relevant difference in the frequency of platelet transfusions were seen between treatment arms in the 
pivotal studies. A review of the time course of anaemia and transfusion need showed that after an 
Jakavi

initial decrease, the levels of haemoglobin gradually increased to a level close to the level observed in 
the control arms by week 36 to week 48. Consistent with these observations, the transfusion needs, 
after an initial increase, decreased over time in both phase III trials. There was no evidence that the 
reductions in spleen size were correlated with improvements of anaemia. 
Clinical chemistry 
Adverse albumin changes were less common in ruxolitinib compared with the comparator arms of the 
pivotal studies, possibly as an effect by ruxolitinib on the B-symptoms /constitutional symptoms 
(weight loss). Bilirubin changes were essentially equal between study arms, including grade 3 values. 
No important differences between arms were seen in creatinine values, where no grade ≥3 values 
were noted in the ruxolitinib arms. Abnormal gamma-GT values were more frequent in the ruxolitinib 
arms overall, but not for grade 3 values. Grade 1 ALT changes were clearly more common in the 
ruxolitinib arms, but grade 2-3 changes only occurred at the 1 % level. Abnormal ALP values overall 
were less common in the ruxolitinib arms than in the comparator arms, and grade 2-3 values occurred 
at similar frequencies. Grade 1 AST changes were clearly higher in the ruxolitinib arms, but grade 2 
values were essentially equal.  
In conclusion, a clearly higher frequency of grade 1 liver transaminase values was the only important 
difference in clinical chemistry values between study arms in the two pivotal studies. No cases fulfilling 
Hy’s law for drug induced liver injury were seen. 
Vital signs 
Vital signs were comparable between treatment groups. The only relevant change in any of the 
parameters includes an increase > 25% compared with baseline in systolic blood pressure in the 
ruxolitinib arms. 
In the phase 3 pivotal clinical studies an increase in systolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or more from 
baseline was recorded in 31.5% of patients on at least one visit compared with 19.5% of the control-
treated patients. In study 351 the mean increase from baseline in systolic BP was 0-2 mmHg on 
ruxolitinib versus a decrease of 2-5 mmHg in the placebo arm. In study 352 mean values showed little 
difference between the ruxolitinib-treated and the control-treated patients. 
In the pivotal studies, Cardiac failure SAEs (including congestive) occurred at around 1% in the pooled 
ruxolitinib arms, similar to the combined control arms. Cerebral haemorrhage SAEs occurred in 2 
patients in Study 352 (0.7% in combined ruxolitinib arms) and in no other treatment arms. 
Tachycardia AEs were more frequent in the control arms. Cardiac murmur was somewhat more 
common in the ruxolitinib arms (5.6% in pooled arms), but the Applicant noted that these events were 
often associated with concomitant anaemia. QT 
A thorough QT Study [INCB 18424-138] was carried out in accordance with ICHE14 guidance. The 
study met the requirements for a negative QT study. In the pivotal studies, the frequencies of QT 
prolongation were the same as in the control arms or less. QT does not appear to be a problem with 
ruxolitinib. 
Withdrawal effects 
Following interruption or discontinuation of Jakavi, symptoms of myelofibrosis may return over a 
period of approximately one week. There have been cases of patients discontinuing Jakavi who 
sustained more severe events, particularly in the presence of acute intercurrent illness. It has not been 
established whether abrupt discontinuation of Jakavi contributed to these events.

Safety in special populations 
Age 
When analyzed by age category, ≤ 65 years old and > 65 years old, the number of patients who 
experienced AEs was generally similar, although specific SOCs and preferred terms were higher in the 
> 65 years old age group, such as Blood and lymphatic system disorders (69.1% vs. 54.0%, mainly 
anaemia and thrombocytopenia), Cardiac disorders (23.5% vs. 12.9%, no single preferred term 
predominating), Infections and infestations (55.6% vs. 43.9%, with largest differences seen in cystitis 
and pneumonia), Vascular disorders(24.1% vs. 11.5%, largest difference seen in haematoma). 
Similarly, SAEs were more frequent in the > 65 years old category (39.5% vs. 16.5%), with a similar 
pattern as seen for AEs. 
Gender 
When analyzed by gender, the number of patients who experienced AEs was generally similar, 
although specific SOCs and preferred terms were unbalanced. It is not unexpected that female patients 
experienced anaemia (43.2% vs. 29.0%), UTI (11.5% vs. 3.1%), and cystitis (7.2% vs. 0%) in 
greater frequency than males, since this reflects the background epidemiology. The more frequent 
weight increased (13.7% vs. 3.1%) could be related to the better efficacy outcomes in females.  
The more frequent hepatobiliary disorders in males compared with females (7.4% vs. 2.9%) could be a 
reflection of background epidemiology, indicated by a similar difference in the placebo arm of Study 
351. The difference in anorexia (6.2% in men vs. 1.4% in women) might also reflect the background 
epidemiology, indicated by similar findings in the BAT arm of Study 352. There is no obvious 
explanation for the difference in frequency of Herpes zoster (4.9% in men vs. 1.4% in women), but it 
could be a chance finding due to small numbers. 
Race 
Since the vast majority of the patients were Caucasian - 89% of ruxolitinib treated patients in Study 
351; and 81% in Study 352 (with the remaining 19% as missing) - it is not possible to have a 
meaningful interpretation of the results for this subgroup analysis. 
Baseline platelet count and Baseline palpated spleen length 
Analyses by baseline platelet count category (< 200 K and ≥200 K) which was a trigger for different 
starting doses of 15 mg b.i.d. and 20 mg b.i.d. respectively, and baseline palpated spleen length > 10 
cm compared with ≥10 cm did not reveal any important differences, other than those that reflect the 
underlying difference in degrees of disease and splenic size. 
Pregnancy 
Two cases of pregnancy after female exposure have been reported; one of the pregnancies occurred 
after exposure to topical ruxolitinib in a psoriasis study and was ongoing at the time of the report with 
no complications reported; the other was followed by elective termination of pregnancy on day 460 of 
treatment with systemic ruxolitinib without further details available. 
Immunological events 
There were no signs of hypersensitivity reactions from ruxolitinib.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Pharmacokinetic interaction 
Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole give rise to an approximate doubling of ruxolitinib 
exposure. CYP2C9 inhibitors are also likely to give rise to increased exposure. A PBPK simulation on 
the exposure after treatment with fluconazole, which is a mild to moderate dual CYP3A4 and 2C9 
inhibitor, predicted a 3-fold increase in ruxolitinib. Thus, a dose reduction of approximately 50% is 
appropriate. 
In vitro data indicate that ruxolitinib may inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 and intestinal Pgp as well as BCRP. 
The interactions are thoroughly covered in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC. There is no drug 
interaction study with an oral contraceptive. Such a study should be done as a post-authorisation 
measure due to the considerations of teratogenicity (see section 2.7 RMP).  
Possible pharmacodynamic interaction 
There is also a theoretical potential pharmacodynamic interaction with haematopoietic growth factor 
drugs, since it has been shown that the receptors of G-CSF,GM-CSF, erythropoietin and thrombopoietin 
all signal through the JAK/STAT system, including (JAK1 and) JAK2 (Numata 2005, Perugini 2010, Choi 
2011, Okonko 2011, Won 2009). Furthermore, enhanced cell-surface expression following JAK over-
expression has also been reported for a number of cytokine receptors, including the thrombopoietin 
and erythropoietin receptors (Meenhuis 2009, and references therein). It is unclear what the 
implications of these findings could be for the management of cytopenias during ruxolitinib therapy. It 
is therefore unknown if there a risk that patients with neutropenia who are using ruxolitinib would be 
unresponsive to G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy. The Applicant has addressed this in the RMP and SmPC. 
Drug-disease interactions 
Hepatic impairment 
An increase in the exposure and half-life of ruxolitinib was observed in patients with hepatic 
impairment. The mean AUC for ruxolitinib was increased in patients with mild, moderate and severe 
hepatic impairment by 87%, 28% and 65%, respectively, compared to patients with normal hepatic 
function and indicating no clear relationship to the degree of hepatic impairment based on Child-Pugh 
scores. The starting dose of Jakavi should be reduced by approximately 50% in patients with hepatic 
impairment. Further dose modifications should be based on the safety and efficacy of the medicinal 
product. 
Renal impairment 
Following a single ruxolitinib dose of 25 mg, the pharmacokinetics were similar in subjects with various 
degrees of renal impairment and in those with normal renal function. However, plasma AUC values of 
ruxolitinib metabolites tended to increase with increasing severity of renal impairment, and were most 
markedly increased in the subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis (see Fig. 7 
below, Cohort 1 are patients with normal function, 5 and 6 are ESRD patients with pre-dose and post-
dose dialysis, respectively.).

The starting dose of ruxolitinib should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment. For 
patients with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis the starting dose should be based on platelet 
counts. Subsequent doses (single administration) should be administered on haemodialysis days 
following each dialysis session. Additional dose modifications should be made with careful monitoring 
of safety and efficacy. The applicant is recommended to provide PD simulations post-approval to try to 
optimize the dosing regimen in ESRD. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The frequency of discontinuations due to AEs were essentially equal across the treatment arms of the 
two pivotal studies, respectively; 11% in both arms of Study 351 and 8% in both arms of Study 352. 
With few exceptions, each PT for discontinuation occurred in single patients (i.e. below the 1% 
frequency), and therefore no important trends can be seen between the ruxolitinib and the control 
arms. Thrombocytopenia and anaemia constitute the main causes for dose reduction or interruption 
(approximately 35 and 5 % respectively) 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The maximum ruxolitinib exposure in any safety study was 24.8 months; maximum exposures in the 
two pivotal phase-III studies were 13.6 and 17.3 months, respectively. The median duration of 
exposure in all three pooled safety populations (Phase 3 population, MF population, and All cancer 
population) was around 10 months. In the phase 1-2 Study 251 longer duration of exposure was seen, 
but the relevance of the safety data from this study is difficult to assess due to the different dosing 
regimens and higher doses. In the combined pivotal studies, 75% of the patients in the ruxolitinib 
arms were still receiving the randomised treatment at data cut-off, indicating that a significantly longer 
duration of exposure can be expected than that for which safety data is currently available. This is 
considered an important lack of long-term safety data, which is particularly important since this is a 
First-in-class substance, which involves central parts of the immune and haematopoietic systems in 
ways not yet fully elucidated.  
The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were thrombocytopenia and anaemia which are 
dose dependent and a direct result of ruxolitinib’s mechanism of action, JAK inhibition.  
Increased frequencies of infection AEs may also be directly related to the JAK inhibition by 
inhibiting/hampering the cytokine signalling of the immune response. Infections were overall more 
common in the ruxolitinib arms compared with controls in the pivotal studies. It appears that while 
infection AEs overall occur more often in the ruxolitinib arms, Grade 3-4 infections occurred at similar 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 70/84
 
 
 
 
 
frequencies as in the placebo and best available therapy arms. The longer observation time in the 
ruxolitinib arms could to some degree explain the higher frequency of infections seen compared with 
the control arms, which is supported by the much lower frequency in the cross-over group (from BAT), 
and possibly also by the higher frequency in Study 252 with longer duration of exposure, although 
higher doses were used in that study.  
There is an indication that UTIs may be particularly overrepresented in the ruxolitinib treated patients, 
the cause for this is unknown and merits further monitoring (see section 2.7 RMP). Cases of 
Tuberculosis have been observed with ruxolitinib. This may represent opportunistic infections that in 
theory could be related to ruxolitinib’s JAK inhibiting mechanism involving central parts of the immune 
system. Close monitoring of severe and opportunistic infections will be performed post marketing in a 
disease registry study. Patients should therefore be assessed for the risk of developing serious 
bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections. Ruxolitinib therapy should not be started until 
active serious infections have resolved. Physicians should carefully observe patients receiving Jakavi 
for signs and symptoms of infections and initiate appropriate treatment promptly 
The frequency of Herpes zoster (shingles) was higher in the ruxolitinib arms compared with the control 
arms of the pivotal studies. Herpes zoster is quite commonly seen in patients with haematological 
malignancies, and based on these figures herpes zoster does not appear to be an important clinical 
problem with ruxolitinib treatment. However, in the phase 2 Study 251, higher frequencies were seen. 
If this is primarily due the longer duration of exposure, rather than the higher doses used in this study 
(or the combination), it could in fact be a larger problem than indicated by the pivotal studies. 
Physicians should educate patients about early signs and symptoms of herpes zoster, advising that 
treatment should be sought as early as possible. 
Treatment with ruxolitinib can cause haematological adverse drug reactions, including 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia and neutropenia. A complete blood count, including a white blood cell 
count differential, must be performed before initiating therapy with Jakavi. Treatment should be 
discontinued in patients with platelet count less than 50,000/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count less 
than 500/mm3. It has been observed that patients with low platelet counts (<200,000/mm3) at the 
start of therapy are more likely to develop thrombocytopenia during treatment. 
Thrombocytopenia is generally reversible and is usually managed by reducing the dose or temporarily 
withholding ruxolitinib. However, platelet transfusions may be required as clinically indicated. 
Patients developing anaemia may require blood transfusions. Dose modifications for patients 
developing anaemia may also be considered. Patients with a haemoglobin level below 10.0 g/dl at the 
beginning of the treatment have a higher risk of developing a haemoglobin level below 8.0 g/dl during 
treatment compared to patients with a higher baseline haemoglobin level (79.3% versus 30.1%). More 
frequent monitoring of haematology parameters and of clinical signs and symptoms of ruxolitinib-
related adverse drug reactions is recommended for patients with baseline haemoglobin below 
10.0 g/dl. 
Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500) was generally reversible and was managed by 
temporarily withholding ruxolitinib.  
Complete blood counts should be monitored as clinically indicated and dose adjusted as required. 
There is an increased risk of bleeding and bruising with ruxolitinib therapy. The mechanism for the 
bleeding events is not fully elucidated, although grade 4 thrombocytopenia is associated with an 
increased incidence of bleeding, as expected. The MF disease in itself has been associated with 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 71/84
 
 
 
 
 
impaired platelet function. Other theoretically possible mechanisms may include vascular/endothelial 
changes, possibly aggravated by ruxolitinib.  
According to pharmacokinetic studies, patients with hepatic and renal impairment will have an 
increased AUC of ruxolitinib due to the decreased metabolism and decreased elimination, respectively. 
Cytopenias were somewhat more frequent in ruxolitinib treated patients with hepatic or renal 
impairment compared to patients without these organ impairments. However, patients with raised 
transaminases did not have a higher frequency of cytopenias compared to the overall patient 
population. 
Apart from the known pharmacokinetic interaction with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, there is also a 
potential pharmacodynamic interaction with haematopoietic growth factor drugs, such as G-CSF and 
erythropoietin, which could be a potential important safety problem if it means that cytopenic patients 
will be unresponsive to treatment with the needed growth factor in question. This is now addressed in 
the RMP and SmPC. 
Concerning splenic infarction, these AEs often occur as a result of the disease (as evident by the higher 
frequencies in the placebo arm). A theoretical concern might be that they could occur at 
discontinuation of ruxolitinib due to sudden massive increase in splenomegaly. One of the three 
ruxolitinib treated cases occurred after discontinuation. It is possible that stopped ruxolitinib treatment 
may have aggravated the already ongoing progressing splenomegaly in this patient; however, it is not 
unlikely that the event would have occurred anyway. While a return of MF symptoms is seen shortly 
after ruxolitinib discontinuation as a reflection of the discontinued JAK inhibition and consequently 
increased cytokine signalling, no exceeding of median symptom score following discontinuation 
compared with median baseline was seen. There is therefore no evidence present of re-bound 
phenomena to excess levels. Unless abrupt discontinuation is required, gradual tapering of the dose of 
Jakavi may be considered, although the utility of the tapering is unproven. 
Weight gain was seen clearly more often in the ruxolitinib arms compared with the control arms of the 
pivotal studies. However, 50% of patients with weight gain had normal renal function and albumin, and 
did not have oedema, fluid retention or any other co-reported AEs as explanatory factors for their 
weight increase, suggesting that in around 50% of patients with weight increases this may have been 
a positive treatment effect. 
Many of the AEs occurred considerably more frequently in the phase 1/2 Study 251 compared with the 
pivotal phase 3 studies (not shown). This could in part be explained by the clearly longer duration of 
exposure in this study (particularly the q.d-arm), but also on the higher doses given in this study 
(again particularly in the q.d. arm). The relevance of the data from Study 251 is therefore uncertain. 
The assessment is therefore focused on the pivotal studies. 
A non-trivial proportion of deaths were due to infections in both the ruxolitinib arm and the placebo 
arm of Study 351. Additional deaths due to infection are seen after cross-over to ruxolitinib in both 
pivotal studies, and in the supportive studies. While a number of these causes of deaths were assessed 
as not related to study drug by investigators, it is not excluded that the JAK inhibition could have 
played some role in the course of the infection, due to its inhibiting effects on cytokine signalling. 
There were three cases of bleeding with fatal outcome in the ruxolitinib arms of the pooled pivotal 
studies, compared with one in the control arms. In the first case, the thrombocytopenia was 
considered related to ruxolitinib treatment and thereby contributory to the subdural haematoma. In 
the latter two cases the bleeding events were considered unrelated to ruxolitinib treatment.  
Considering the epidemiology of bleeding in ruxolitinib unexposed PMF (See RMP), and the disease 
characteristics and other circumstances of these patients, the contribution of ruxolitinib to the bleeding 
events is uncertain. The effect of ruxolitinib on the platelet count may not be the main mechanism for 
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 72/84
 
 
 
 
bleeding in these observed cases with fatal outcome. Data from ongoing and future trials may clarify 
this issue. 
The practical significance of the more frequent increased systolic blood pressure in the ruxolitinib arms 
is not clear. Generally, hypertension is associated with an increased risk of stroke and myocardial 
infarction, and has been identified as a leading cause of cardiovascular death. Pharmacologically, there 
are mechanistic relationships between JAK signalling and inhibition, and blood pressure, however not 
easily predictable in the individual patient. Increased systolic blood pressure has been included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP and as an adverse drug reaction in the SmPC. 
There are no data from the use of ruxolitinib in pregnant women. The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. As a precautionary measure, the use of ruxolitinib during pregnancy is contraindicated. 
Women of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during the treatment with 
ruxolitinib. In case pregnancy should occur during treatment with ruxolitinib, a risk/benefit evaluation 
must be carried out on an individual basis with careful counselling regarding potential risks to the 
foetus. 
Ruxolitinib must also not be used during breast-feeding and breast-feeding should therefore be 
discontinued when treatment is started. It is unknown whether ruxolitinib and/or its metabolites are 
excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. There are no human data on 
the effect of ruxolitinib on fertility 
Ruxolitinib has no or negligible sedating effect. However, patients who experience dizziness after the 
intake of Jakavi should refrain from driving or using machines. 
The effect (positive or negative) of ruxolitinib therapy on the development of bone-marrow fibrosis is 
currently unknown, and requires further investigation. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
While nearly 60% of the patients in the phase III trials had dose reductions and nearly 30% had dose 
interruptions, there was a low discontinuation rate due to adverse events.  
Cytopenias are expected by ruxolitinib’s JAK inhibiting mechanism of action. These appear manageable 
by dose modifications and transfusions, and are well covered in the SmPC. 
Bleeding and infections could also to some degree be expected by the mechanism of action (bleeding 
as a consequence of thrombocytopenia), but this requires further investigation and monitoring. An 
effort to elucidate the full mechanisms for bleeding is desirable. The long-term consequences with 
regard to severe and opportunistic infections will be addressed in a disease registry study.  
The vast majority of non-hematologic adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and occurred 
at a low frequency. 
In conclusion, long-term safety requires further investigation and follow-up of the pivotal trials and in 
the disease registry study. This should include monitoring of mortality rates and causes of death. Being 
a first in class-compound, no lessons can be learned by class effects of similar compounds (see section 
2.7 RMP).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
This application is based on two pivotal studies, with support from a phase I/II dose-finding study: The 
double-blind placebo-controlled 351 study (n=309) and the open 352 study (n=219) that was 
controlled by investigator’s best choice of available therapy. Both studies are considered well-
conducted. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the pivotal studies was the proportion of patients achieving ≥35% 
reduction in spleen volume from baseline, analysed at 24 weeks in protocol 351 and at 48 weeks in 
protocol 352; in study 351, 65 subjects (41.9%; 95% CI 34.1-50.1) reached this endpoint in the 
ruxolitinib arm and 1 subject (0.7%; 95% CI 0.0-3.6) in the placebo arm, (p<0.0001); in study 352, 
41 subjects (28.5%; 95% CI 21.3-36.6) reached this endpoint in the ruxolitinib arm and no subject 
(0%; 95% CI 0.0-0.5) in the BAT arm, (p<0.0001). An analysis of data at week 24 (secondary 
endpoint) in the study 352 showed that 46 patients (31.9%) in the ruxolitinib arm reached the cut-off 
at that time point. Thus, although the response rate for unknown reasons differs somewhat between 
the studies, it is concluded that approximately one third of patients reach the pre-specified level of 
spleen volume reduction. Comparison of these MRI/CT-achieved data with palpation data reveals that 
they roughly correspond to a spleen size reduction of 50%, which is considered clinically relevant. 
Waterfall analyses confirm the efficacy and show that the majority of, albeit not all, patients in the 
ruxolitinib arms achieved some level of spleen volume reduction, which was not the case in either the 
placebo arm or the BAT arm. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint in both pivotal studies indicate that patients harbouring the 
JAK2V617F mutation have a higher response rate than patients lacking the mutation; 47.8% vs 27.5% 
in the 351 study, and 32.7% vs 14.3% in the 352 study, respectively. 
Duration of response was a secondary endpoint in both studies. In the 351 study, the median duration 
of response was 48 weeks. However, as the median was not reached in the 352 study, duration of 
response remains to be described. 
The analyses of effect of ruxolitinib on MF-related symptoms and QoL are most reliable for the 351 
protocol as the study was placebo-controlled. Using the modified MF symptom assessment instrument, 
a ≥50% improvement from baseline in total symptom score at week 24 was seen for 45.9% of 
subjects in the ruxolitinib arm and 5.3% in the placebo arm, (p<0.0001), supported by an 
improvement in mean/median change from baseline in total symptom score for the ruxolitinib arm 
while a mean/median worsening was noted in the placebo arm, (p<0.0001). Using the EORTC QLQ-
C30 instrument, although not specifically validated in MF, statistically significant improvements at week 
24 in the ruxolitinib arm over the placebo arm were noted in global health status and the majority of 
functional subscales. In analogy with the outcome seen for spleen volume per mutational group, 
superior results are achieved in the JAK2 mutation positive group also for symptom relief: Percent of 
subjects achieving greater than or equal to 50% reduction in TSS from baseline to week 24, median

percent improvement from baseline at week 24 in TSS, and median time to first greater than or equal 
to 50% improvement from baseline in TSS were all in favour of the JAK2 positive group; 52.3% vs 
28.2% in the JAK2 negative group, 65.1% vs 29.4%, and 4.0 vs 6.6 weeks, respectively. 
Currently available updated overall survival data shows, although formally not statistically significant, a 
nominal improvement in overall survival with the use of ruxolitinib over placebo/best available therapy 
and no difference in progression free survival between ruxolitinib and best available therapy.  
Elevation of pSTAT3 and inflammation markers (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP) were noted at baseline and 
decreased following treatment with ruxolitinib, supporting the stated mechanism of action also in vivo. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The results of progression-free survival, overall survival and leukaemia-free survival are immature and 
need further follow-up in order to confirm the long term benefit of ruxolitinib in the CHMP endorsed 
indication. This is reflected as an annex II condition. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Cytopenias were the most frequent AEs in the pivotal studies and are expected by the mechanism of 
action. Thrombocytopenia and anaemia constitute the main causes for dose reduction or interruption. 
A very significantly increased risk (nearly 80%) of grade 3-4 haemoglobin levels in patients starting at 
grade 2, compared with grade 1 (35%) was seen. As a consequence of cytopenias an increased need 
for blood transfusions were seen; approximately 50-60% vs. 40% in the ruxolitinib arms compared 
with the controls. No relevant difference in the frequency of platelet transfusions were seen between 
treatment arms in the pivotal studies (around 5% in both).  
There is an increased risk of bleeding and bruising with ruxolitinib therapy. Grade 3-4 AEs and SAEs 
frequencies were similar to the control arms. Bruising events was the main driver of the difference in 
bleeding events between study arms, but an increase in bleeding events other than bruising was also 
seen (19,3 vs. 15,2% in the ruxolitinib vs. control arms pooled data, respectively), this is mentioned in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Infections were overall more common in the ruxolitinib arms compared with controls in the pivotal 
studies, although grade 3-4 and SAEs did not generally appear significantly more frequent. In the 
prolonged follow-up a total of 3 cases of tuberculosis have been observed in the ruxolitinib arms of the 
pivotal trials, while no reports have been received from comparator arms. This finding is an 
observandum as it could represent an opportunistic infection. 
Weight gain was reported as an AE in 10.0% of the ruxolitinib treated patients in the pivotal studies 
and in 1.3% in the pooled control arms. However, 50% of patients with weight gain had normal renal 
function and albumin, and did not have oedema, fluid retention or any other co-reported AEs as 
explanatory factors for their weight increase, suggesting that in around 50% of patients with weight 
increases this may have been a positive treatment effect. 
Grade 1 raised liver transaminases were frequently seen in the ruxolitinib treated patients, but no 
increase compared with controls were seen in grade 2 values. Grade 3 values were only seen for ALT, 
in the ruxolitinib arm at the 1% level. Increases in transaminases were not associated with an 
increased risk of cytopenias.  
Jakavi 
CHMP assessment report

There is a known pharmacokinetic interaction with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, and also it may not be 
excluded that ruxolitinib inhibits intestinal CYP3A4, Pgp and BCRP. There is no drug interaction study 
with an oral contraceptive. The risk is handled in the SmPC including clear dose reduction instructions. 
In addition, the applicant will conduct a DDI study with oral contraceptives as reflected in section 2.7 
(RMP). Generally, only minor differences in safety according to mutational status were noted. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The median duration of exposure in all three pooled safety populations was around 10 months. In the 
combined pivotal studies, 75% of the patients in the ruxolitinib arms were still receiving the 
randomised treatment at data cut-off, indicating that a significantly longer duration of exposure can be 
expected than that for which safety data is currently available. This is considered an important lack of 
long-term safety data, which is particularly important since this it is a First-in-class substance, which 
involves central parts of the immune and haematopoietic systems in ways not yet fully elucidated. This 
is reflected in the RMP as important missing information and data will be provided by a long term 
Safety Study (CINC424AIC01T) included in the RMP and the extension phases of pivotal trials INCB 
18424-351 and INC424A2352 included in annex II as conditions to the marketing authorisation. 
Thus, the frequency and type of infections in long-term use is a concern due to the mechanism of 
action. There is an indication that infections in the urinary tract may be particularly overrepresented in 
the ruxolitinib treated patients, the cause for this is unknown and merits further investigation and 
monitoring. This information has been reflected in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. Further data will 
be provided by the long term Safety Study (CINC424AIC01T) and the extension phases of studies 
INCB 18424-351 and INC424A2352. 
The mechanism for the bleeding events is not clear, and although at least a proportion of events 
theoretically would be explained by thrombocytopenia this did not appear to be the case with the 3 
fatal cases of bleeding in the pivotal trials. Information regarding bleeding is included in the section 4.8 
of the SmPC and further data will be provided by the long term Safety Study (CINC424AIC01T) and 
the extension phases of studies INCB 18424-351 and INC424A2352. 
Although theoretical discussions and non-clinical data indicate a favourable effect of ruxolitinib on bone 
marrow fibrosis, available clinical data do not allow any conclusions to be made. Knowledge about 
adverse as well as beneficial long-term effects of ruxolitinib on this hallmark feature of the disease is 
considered to be of important value and further vigilance is indicated. The long term Safety Study 
(CINC424AIC01T) and the extension phases of studies INCB 18424-351 and INC424A2352 will provide 
important information. 
There is a theoretical possibility of a pharmacodynamic interaction with haematopoietic growth factor 
drugs, such as G-CSF and erythropoietin, which needs further investigation and could be a potential 
important safety problem if it means that cytopenic patients will be unresponsive to treatment with the 
needed growth factor in question. This potential interaction is included in the SmPC sections 4.4. and 
4.5. 
It is possible that MF patients requiring cytoreductive therapy might in clinical practice be offered 
symptom reducing ruxolitinib in combination with cytoreductive therapy, such as Hydroxyurea (HU). 
Combination therapy does not appear to have been studied and the safety of such combination therapy 
is unknown. This lack of data regarding combination therapy is addressed in sections 4.4. and 4.5 of 
the SmPC. 
Further PK drug interactions are requested and will be provided post authorisation as reflected in 
section 2.7 (RMP).

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In addition to cytopenias and cytemias, constitutional symptoms and symptoms related to 
splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis are prominent features of the morbidity seen in MF 
patients. The current therapeutic arsenal is limited, with hydroxyurea probably being the most widely 
used drug in the indication of MF in the EU (nationally approved), not well-characterised in the 
indication, and leaving a substantial number of patients without disease control and to palliation only.  
In this context, the achievement of a ≥35% spleen volume reduction in approximately one third of 
patients, including those with no alternative treatment and compared to none in the BAT arm of the 
352 study, is considered to be of clinical importance. It is noted that this volume reduction roughly 
corresponds to a 50% decrease in palpation length, which is a criterion for clinical improvement in the 
EUMNET and IWG criteria. In clinical experience, a reduced spleen size is associated with reduced 
abdominal symptoms and less hypersplenism and could hypothetically decrease the risk associated 
with splenectomy if this is to be performed. Although the duration of response remains to be fully 
evaluated, the median duration of response of 48 weeks seen in Study 351 is judged to be long 
enough to be of clinical value. 
Regarding symptom relief and QoL, any improvement in this patient population is of value; the results 
seen in Study 351 study are considered important. 
The three main safety concerns are bone-marrow depression, infections and bleeding.  
As indicated by the frequencies in the control arms of the pivotal studies, cytopenias are common in 
the target population due to the underlying MF disease, and transfusions are given to the target 
population in high frequency anyway. The increase in blood transfusion frequency from 40% to 50-
60% would probably be considered by most patients to be compensated by the symptom reducing 
effects, even though for many patients this requires hospital care. Overall, cytopenias appear 
manageable by dose modifications and transfusions.  
Infections are also more common in the target population compared with healthy subjects, due to the 
underlying disease. If a markedly increased risk of severe and opportunistic infections were seen it 
could represent a problem for the future B/R balance. It therefore requires prospective monitoring. 
Bleeding is common in the target population. As noted by the Applicant in the submitted RMP, 
thrombo-haemorrhagic events have been reported among principal causes of death in PMF, and in one 
study bleeding was the final cause of death in 2.7%of PMF patients. The MF disease in itself has been 
associated with impaired platelet function. Since there was no relevant increase in grade 3-4 or SAE 
bleeding events, it is believed that the overall increase of 7% in bleeding events in ruxolitinib treated 
patients in the pivotal studies can be acceptable. 
Benefit-risk balance 
In patients with V617F mutation positive disease, the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. The B/R 
balance is considered borderline positive also for the group of patients with V617F mutation negative 
disease, although a relatively smaller treatment effect was seen in this population. 
A remaining uncertainty with regard to efficacy is whether the reduction in spleen size translates to 
improvements in progression free survival, leukaemia free survival or overall survival.  
The safety profile of ruxolitinib is considered acceptable in relation to the benefits. Some long-term 
safety and questions related to interactions will be addressed as post authorisation measures.

The Applicant should therefore provide follow-up efficacy and safety data for patients in both phase III 
studies INCB 18424-351 and INC424A2352 annually including data on the time related endpoints 
(overall survival, progression free survival and leukaemia free survival) until the mature data on 
overall survival is available (see Annex II). 
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Jakavi in the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly and symptoms 
in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post 
polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

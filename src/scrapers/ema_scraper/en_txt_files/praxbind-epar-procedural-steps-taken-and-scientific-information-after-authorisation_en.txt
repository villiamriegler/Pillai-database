SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
including all variations introduced since the marketing 
and PL 
authorisation was granted, the benefit-risk balance of 
Praxbind in its approved indication(s) (please refer to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics) remains favourable 
and therefore the renewal of the marketing authorisation is 
recommended, subject to the conditions as detailed in 
Annex II. 
The renewal is recommended to be granted with unlimited 
validity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Early breast cancer 
Verzenios in combination with endocrine therapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult 
patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-negative, node-positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence (see section 5.1). 
In pre- or perimenopausal women, aromatase inhibitor endocrine therapy should be combined with a 
luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. 
Advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
Verzenios is indicated for the treatment of women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in 
combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or in women 
who have received prior endocrine therapy. 
In pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a LHRH agonist. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Verzenios therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the use of 
anti-cancer therapies. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of abemaciclib is 150 mg twice daily when used in combination with 
endocrine therapy. Please refer to the summary of product characteristics of the endocrine therapy 
combination partner for the recommended posology.  
Duration of treatment 
Early breast cancer 
Verzenios should be taken continuously for two years, or until disease recurrence or unacceptable 
toxicity occurs. 
Advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
Verzenios should be taken continuously as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit from therapy 
or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
If a patient vomits or misses a dose of Verzenios, the patient should be instructed to take the next dose 
at its scheduled time; an additional dose should not be taken. 
Dose adjustments 
Management of some adverse reactions may require dose interruption and/or dose reduction as shown 
in Tables 1-7.

CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided. If strong CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot 
be avoided, the abemaciclib dose should be reduced to 100 mg twice daily. 
In patients who have had their dose reduced to 100 mg abemaciclib twice daily and in whom 
co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the abemaciclib dose should be 
further reduced to 50 mg twice daily. 
In patients who have had their dose reduced to 50 mg abemaciclib twice daily and in whom 
co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the abemaciclib dose may be 
continued with close monitoring of signs of toxicity. Alternatively, the abemaciclib dose may be 
reduced to 50 mg once daily or discontinued. 
If the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the abemaciclib dose should be increased to the dose used 
prior to the initiation of the CYP3A4 inhibitor (after 3 to 5 half-lives of the CYP3A4 inhibitor). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required based on age (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustments are necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There are no 
data regarding abemaciclib administration in patients with severe renal impairment, end stage renal 
disease, or in patients on dialysis (see section 5.2). Abemaciclib should be administered with caution 
in patients with severe renal impairment, with close monitoring for signs of toxicity. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustments are necessary in patients with mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate (Child Pugh B) 
hepatic impairment. In patients with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment, a decrease in dosing 
frequency to once daily is recommended (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of abemaciclib in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years has not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Verzenios is for oral use. 
The dose can be taken with or without food. It should not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit juice 
(see section 4.5). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should take the doses at approximately the same times every day. 
The tablet should be swallowed whole (patients should not chew, crush, or split tablets before 
swallowing). 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia was reported in patients receiving abemaciclib. Dose modification is recommended for 
patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (see section 4.2). Fatal events of neutropenic sepsis 
occurred in < 1 % of patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients should be instructed to report any 
episode of fever to their healthcare provider. 
Infections/infestations 
Infections were reported in patients receiving abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy at a higher rate than 
in patients treated with endocrine therapy. Lung infection was reported in patients receiving 
abemaciclib without concurrent neutropenia. Fatal events occurred in < 1 % of patients with metastatic 
breast cancer. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated as 
medically appropriate. 
Venous thromboembolism 
Venous thromboembolic events were reported in patients treated with abemaciclib plus endocrine 
therapy. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism and treated as medically appropriate. Based on the grade of VTE, abemaciclib may require 
dose modification (see section 4.2). 
Arterial Thromboembolic Events  
A potential increased risk for serious arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs), including ischemic 
stroke and myocardial infarction, has been observed in metastatic breast cancer studies when 
abemaciclib was administered in combination with endocrine therapies. The benefits and risks of 
continuing abemaciclib in patients who experience a serious ATE should be considered. 
Increased aminotransferases 
Increases in ALT and AST were reported in patients receiving abemaciclib. Based on the level of ALT 
or AST elevation, abemaciclib may require dose modification (see section 4.2).  
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea is the most common adverse reaction. Across clinical studies, median time to onset of the 
first diarrhoea event was approximately 6 to 8 days, and median duration of diarrhoea was 7 to 
12 days (Grade 2) and 5 to 8 days (Grade 3). Diarrhoea can be associated with dehydration. Patients 
should start treatment with antidiarrhoeal agents such as loperamide at the first sign of loose stools, 
increase oral fluids and notify their healthcare provider. Dose modification is recommended for 
patients who develop ≥ Grade 2 diarrhoea (see section 4.2).  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ILD/Pneumonitis 
ILD/pneumonitis was reported in patients receiving abemaciclib. Patients should be monitored for 
pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis and treated as medically appropriate. Based on 
the grade of ILD/pneumonitis, abemaciclib may require dose modification (see section 4.2). 
Permanently discontinue abemaciclib in patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis. 
Concomitant use of inducers of CYP3A4 
Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided due to the risk of decreased efficacy of 
abemaciclib (see section 4.5). 
Visceral crisis 
There are no data on the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in patients with visceral crisis. 
Lactose 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib  
Abemaciclib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Co-administration of abemaciclib with CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase plasma concentrations of 
abemaciclib. In patients with advanced and/or metastatic cancer, co-administration of the CYP3A4 
inhibitor clarithromycin resulted in a 3.4-fold increase in the plasma exposure of abemaciclib and a 
2.5-fold increase in the combined unbound potency adjusted plasma exposure of abemaciclib and its 
active metabolites. 
Use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors together with abemaciclib should be avoided. If strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors need to be co-administered, the dose of abemaciclib should be reduced (see section 4.2), 
followed by careful monitoring of toxicity. Examples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include, but not 
limited to: clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, posaconazole or 
voriconazole. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice.  
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients treated with moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors. There 
should, however, be close monitoring for signs of toxicity. 
CYP3A4 inducers 
Co-administration of abemaciclib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin decreased the plasma 
concentration of abemaciclib by 95 % and unbound potency adjusted plasma concentration of 
abemaciclib plus its active metabolites by 77 % based on AUC0-∞. Concomitant use of strong 
CYP3A4 inducers (including, but not limited to: carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin and St. John’s 
wort) should be avoided due to the risk of decreased efficacy of abemaciclib.

Effects of abemaciclib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products  
Medicinal products that are substrates of transporters 
Abemaciclib and its major active metabolites inhibit the renal transporters organic cation transporter 2 
(OCT2), multidrug and extrusion toxin protein (MATE1), and MATE2-K. In vivo interactions of 
abemaciclib with clinically relevant substrates of these transporters, such as dofetilide or creatinine, 
may occur (see section 4.8). In a clinical drug interaction study with metformin (substrate of OCT2, 
MATE1 and 2) co-administered with 400 mg abemaciclib, a small but not clinically relevant increase 
(37 %) in metformin plasma exposure was observed. This was found to be due to reduced renal 
secretion with unaffected glomerular filtration. 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of abemaciclib and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate 
loperamide resulted in an increase in loperamide plasma exposure of 9 % based on AUC0-∞ and 35 % 
based on Cmax. This was not considered to be clinically relevant. However, based on the in vitro 
inhibition of P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) observed with abemaciclib, in vivo 
interactions of abemaciclib with narrow therapeutic index substrates of these transporters, such as 
digoxin or dabigatran etexilate, may occur. 
In a clinical study in patients with breast cancer, there was no clinically-relevant pharmacokinetic drug 
interaction between abemaciclib and anastrozole, fulvestrant, exemestane, letrozole or tamoxifen. 
It is currently unknown whether abemaciclib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting 
hormonal contraceptives. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should use highly effective contraception methods (e.g. 
double-barrier contraception) during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after completing therapy (see 
section 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of abemaciclib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Verzenios is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women of child-bearing potential not using contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether abemaciclib is excreted in human milk. A risk to breast-feeding children cannot 
be excluded. Patients receiving abemaciclib should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
The effect of abemaciclib on fertility in humans is unknown. While in rats no effects on male fertility 
were noted, cytotoxic effects to the male reproductive tract in mice, rats, and dogs indicate that 
abemaciclib may impair fertility in males. No adverse effects on female reproductive organs in mice, 
rats, or dogs, nor effects on female fertility and early embryonic development in rats were observed 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Verzenios has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to 
be cautious when driving or using machines in case they experience fatigue or dizziness during 
treatment with Verzenios (see section 4.8).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia was reported frequently across studies. In the monarchE study, neutropenia was reported 
in 45.8 % of patients. Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil counts (based on laboratory findings) was 
reported in 19.1 % of patients receiving abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy with a 
median time to onset of 30 days, and median time to resolution of 16 days. Febrile neutropenia was 
reported in 0.3 % patients. In MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 studies, neutropenia was reported in 
45.1 % of patients. Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil counts (based on laboratory findings) was 
reported in 28.2 % of patients receiving abemaciclib in combination with aromatase inhibitors or 
fulvestrant. The median time to onset of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 29 to 33 days, and median time 
to resolution was 11 to 15 days. Febrile neutropenia was reported in 0.9 % patients. Dose modification 
is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (see section 4.2).  
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea was the most commonly reported adverse reaction (see Table 8). Incidence was greatest 
during the first month of abemaciclib treatment and was lower subsequently. In the monarchE study, 
the median time to onset of the first diarrhoea event of any grade was 8 days. The median duration of 
diarrhoea was 7 days for Grade 2 and 5 days for Grade 3. In MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 studies, 
the median time to onset of the first diarrhoea event of any grade was approximately 6 to 8 days. The 
median duration of diarrhoea was 9 to 12 days for Grade 2 and 6 to 8 days for Grade 3. Diarrhoea 
returned to baseline or lesser grade with supportive treatment such as loperamide and/or dose 
adjustment (see section 4.2). 
Increased aminotransferases 
In the monarchE study, ALT and AST elevations were reported frequently (12.3 % and 11.8 %, 
respectively) in patients receiving abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy. Grade 3 or 4 
ALT or AST elevations (based on laboratory findings) were reported in 2.6 % and 1.6 % patients. The 
median time to onset of Grade 3 or 4 ALT elevation was 118 days, and median time to resolution was 
14.5 days. The median time to onset of Grade 3 or 4 AST elevation was 90.5 days, and median time to 
resolution was 11 days. In MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 studies, ALT and AST elevations were 
reported frequently (15.1 % and 14.2 %, respectively) in patients receiving abemaciclib in 
combination with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant. Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations (based on 
laboratory findings) were reported in 6.1 % and 4.2 % patients. The median time to onset of Grade 3 
or 4 ALT elevation was 57 to 61 days, and median time to resolution was 14 days. The median time to 
onset of Grade 3 or 4 AST elevation was 71 to 185 days, and median time to resolution was 13 to 
11 
 
 
 
 
15 days. Dose modification is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST 
increase (see section 4.2). 
Creatinine 
Although not an adverse reaction, abemaciclib has been shown to increase serum creatinine. In the 
monarchE study, 99.3 % of patients had serum creatinine elevations (based on laboratory findings), 
and of these, 0.5 % of patients had Grade 3 or 4 elevations. In patients receiving endocrine therapy 
alone, 91.0 % reported an increase in serum creatinine (all laboratory grades). In MONARCH 2 and 
MONARCH 3 studies, 98.3 % of patients had serum creatinine elevations (based on laboratory 
findings), and of these, 1.9 % of patients had Grade 3 or 4 elevations. In patients receiving an 
aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant alone, 78.4 % reported an increase in serum creatinine (all 
laboratory grades). Abemaciclib has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of renal 
tubular secretion transporters without affecting glomerular function (as measured by iohexol 
clearance) (see section 4.5). In clinical studies, increases in serum creatinine occurred within the first 
month of abemaciclib dosing, remained elevated but stable through the treatment period, were 
reversible upon treatment discontinuation, and were not accompanied by changes in markers of renal 
function, such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN), cystatin C, or calculated glomerular filtration rate based 
on cystatin C. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
In the event of an abemaciclib overdose, fatigue and diarrhoea may occur. General supportive care 
should be provided.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinases inhibitors, ATC code: L01EF03 
Mechanism of action 
Abemaciclib is a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and 
CDK6), and most active against Cyclin D1/CDK4 in enzymatic assays. Abemaciclib prevents 
retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation, blocking cell cycle progression from the G1 to the 
S-phase of cell division, leading to suppression of tumour growth. In oestrogen receptor-positive 
breast cancer cell lines, sustained target inhibition with abemaciclib prevented rebound of Rb 
phosphorylation resulting in cell senescence and apoptosis. In vitro, Rb-negative and Rb-depleted 
cancer cell lines are generally less sensitive to abemaciclib. In breast cancer xenograft models, 
abemaciclib dosed daily without interruption at clinically relevant concentrations alone or in 
combination with anti-oestrogens resulted in reduction of tumour size.

Pharmacodynamic effects 
In cancer patients, abemaciclib inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 as indicated by inhibition of 
phosphorylation of Rb and topoisomerase II alpha, which results in cell cycle inhibition upstream of 
the G1 restriction point. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
The effect of abemaciclib on the QTcF interval was evaluated in 144 patients with advanced cancer. 
No large change (that is, > 20 ms) in the QTcF interval was detected at the mean observed maximal 
steady state abemaciclib concentration following a therapeutic dosing schedule. 
In an exposure-response analysis in healthy subjects at exposures comparable to a 200 mg twice-daily 
dose, abemaciclib did not prolong the QTcF interval to any clinically relevant extent. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Early breast cancer 
Randomised Phase 3 Study monarchE: Verzenios in combination with endocrine therapy 
The efficacy and safety of Verzenios in combination with adjuvant endocrine therapy was evaluated in 
monarchE, a randomised, open label, two cohort, phase 3 study, in women and men with HR-positive, 
HER2-negative, node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. High risk of recurrence in 
Cohort 1 was defined by clinical and pathological features: either ≥ 4 pALN (positive axillary lymph 
nodes), or 1-3 pALN and at least one of the following criteria: tumor size ≥ 5 cm or histological 
grade 3.  
A total of 5 637 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2 years of Verzenios 150 mg twice 
daily plus physician’s choice of standard endocrine therapy, or standard endocrine therapy alone. 
Randomization was stratified by prior chemotherapy, menopausal status, and region. Men were 
stratified as postmenopausal. Patients had completed definitive locoregional therapy (with or without 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy). Patients must have recovered from the acute side effects of 
any prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. A washout period of 21 days after chemotherapy and 14 days 
after radiotherapy prior to randomization was required. Patients were allowed to receive up to 
12 weeks of adjuvant endocrine therapy prior to randomisation. Adjuvant treatment with fulvestrant 
was not allowed as standard endocrine therapy. Patients with eastern cooperative oncology group 
(ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1 were eligible. Patients with history of VTEs were excluded from 
the study. After the end of the study treatment period, in both treatment arms patients continued to 
receive adjuvant endocrine therapy for a cumulative duration of at least 5 years and up to 10 years, if 
medically appropriate. LHRH agonists were given when clinically indicated to pre- and 
perimenopausal women, and men. 
Among the 5 637 randomised patients, 5 120 were enrolled in Cohort 1, representing 91 % of the 
ITT population. In Cohort 1, patient demographics and baseline tumour characteristics were balanced 
between treatment arms. The median age of patients enrolled was approximately 51 years (range, 
22-89 years), 15 % of patients were 65 or older, 99 % were women, 71 % were Caucasian, 24 % were 
Asian, and 5 % Other. Forty three percent of patients were pre- or perimenopausal. Most patients 
received prior chemotherapy (36 % neoadjuvant, 62 % adjuvant), and prior radiotherapy (96 %). 
Initial endocrine therapy received by patients included letrozole (39 %), tamoxifen (31 %), anastrozole 
(22 %), or exemestane (8 %). 
Sixty-five percent of the patients had 4 or more positive lymph nodes, 41 % had Grade 3 tumour, and 
24 % had pathological tumour size ≥ 5 cm at surgery. 
The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in ITT population defined as the time 
from randomization to the first occurrence of ipsilateral invasive breast tumour recurrence, regional 
invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, second 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
primary non-breast invasive cancer, or death attributable to any cause. Key secondary endpoint was 
distant relapse free survival (DRFS) in ITT population defined as time from randomization to the first 
occurrence of distant recurrence, or death attributable to any cause. 
The primary objective of the study was met at the pre-planned interim analysis (16 Mar 2020 cut-off). 
A statistically significant improvement in IDFS was observed in patients who received Verzenios plus 
endocrine therapy versus endocrine therapy alone in the ITT population. The approval was granted for 
the large subpopulation, Cohort 1.  
In a further analysis (01 April 2021 cut-off), 91 % of the patients in Cohort 1 were off the 2-year study 
treatment period and the median duration of follow-up was 27.7 months.  
Efficacy results in Cohort 1 are summarised in Table 9 and Figure 1.

Advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
Randomised Phase 3 Study MONARCH 3: Verzenios in combination with aromatase inhibitors 
The efficacy and safety of Verzenios in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole or 
letrozole) was evaluated in MONARCH 3, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 
study in women with HR  positive, HER2  negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who 
had not received prior systemic therapy in this disease setting. Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio 
to receive Verzenios 150 mg twice daily plus a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor given daily at the 
recommended dose versus placebo plus a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor according to the same 
schedule. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated 
according to RECIST 1.1; key secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), 
clinical benefit rate (CBR) and overall survival (OS). 
The median age of patients enrolled was 63 years (range 32 - 88). Approximately 39 % of patients had 
received chemotherapy and 44 % had received antihormonal therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting. 
Patients with prior (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy must have completed this therapy at least 
12 months before study randomisation. The majority of patients (96 %) had metastatic disease at 
baseline. Approximately 22 % of patients had bone-only disease, and 53 % patients had visceral 
metastases.  
The study met its primary endpoint of improving PFS. Primary efficacy results are summarised in 
Table 10 and Figure 2.

These results correspond to a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease progression or 
death of 46 % for patients treated with abemaciclib plus an aromatase inhibitor. 
OS was not mature at the final PFS analysis (93 events observed across the two arms). The HR was 
1.057 (95 % CI: 0.683, 1.633), p = 0.8017. 
A series of prespecified subgroup PFS analyses showed consistent results across patient subgroups 
including age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), disease site, disease setting (de novo metastatic vs recurrent 
metastatic vs locally advanced recurrent), presence of measurable disease, progesterone receptor 
status, and baseline ECOG performance status. A reduction in the risk of disease progression or death 
was observed in patients with visceral disease, (HR of 0.567 [95 % CI: 0.407, 0.789]), median PFS 
21.6 months versus 14.0 months; in patients with bone-only disease (HR of 0.565 [95 % CI: 0.306, 
1.044]); and in patients with measurable disease (HR of 0.517 [95 % CI: 0.392, 0.681]). 
At the first OS interim analysis, 197 events were observed across the two arms and the HR was 
0.786 (95 % CI: 0.589, 1.049). 
At the second OS interim analysis, 255 events were observed across the two arms. Median OS was 
67.1 months in the abemaciclib plus AI arm and 54.5 months in the placebo plus AI arm. As the 
observed HR of 0.754 (95 % CI: 0.584, 0.974) did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3), the 
study continues to fully characterise OS.

Randomised Phase 3 Study MONARCH 2: Verzenios in combination with fulvestrant 
The efficacy and safety of Verzenios in combination with fulvestrant was evaluated in MONARCH 2, 
a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in women with HR positive, HER2 
negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive Verzenios 150 mg twice daily plus fulvestrant 500 mg at intervals of one month, with an 
additional 500 mg dose given two weeks after the initial dose, versus placebo plus fulvestrant 
according to the same schedule. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated 
according to RECIST 1.1; key secondary efficacy endpoints included ORR, CBR and OS. 
The median age of patients enrolled was 60 years (range, 32 - 91 years). In each treatment arm the 
majority of patients were white, and had not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 17 % of 
patients were pre/perimenopausal on ovarian suppression with a GnRH agonist. Approximately 56 % 
patients had visceral metastases. Approximately 25 % of patients had primary endocrine resistance 
(progression on endocrine therapy within the first 2 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy or within the 
first 6 months of first line endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer) and for the majority, 
endocrine resistance developed later. 59 % of patients had most recent endocrine therapy in the 
(neo)adjuvant setting, and 38 % in metastatic setting. 
The study met its primary endpoint of improving PFS. Primary efficacy results are summarised in 
Table 11 and Figure 4.

Figure 4. MONARCH 2: Kaplan-Meier plot of progression-free survival (Investigator 
assessment, intent-to-treat population) 
These results correspond to a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease progression or 
death of 44.7 % for patients treated with Verzenios plus fulvestrant. Verzenios plus fulvestrant 
prolonged progression-free survival with neither a clinically meaningful, or significant detriment to 
health-related quality of life. 
A series of prespecified subgroup PFS analyses showed consistent results across patient subgroups 
including age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), race, geographic region, disease site, endocrine therapy resistance, 
presence of measurable disease, progesterone receptor status, and menopausal status. A reduction in 
the risk of disease progression or death was observed in patients with visceral disease, (HR of 0.481 
[95 %CI: 0.369, 0.627]), median PFS 14.7 months versus 6.5 months; in patients with bone-only 
disease (HR of 0.543 [95 % CI: 0.355, 0.833]); patients with measurable disease (HR of 0.523 
[95 % CI: 0.412, 0.644]). In patients who were pre/perimenopausal, the hazard ratio was 
0.415 (95 % CI: 0.246, 0.698); in patients who were progesterone receptor negative, the HR was 
0.509  (95 % CI: 0.325, 0.797). 
In a sub-population with locally advanced or metastatic disease that had not received prior endocrine 
therapy, the PFS was also consistent. 
At the pre-specified interim OS analysis (20 June 2019 cut-off), the ITT population showed a 
statistically significant improvement in patients receiving Verzenios plus fulvestrant compared with 
those receiving placebo plus fulvestrant. The OS results are summarized in Table 12.

At the pre-specified final OS analysis (18 March 2022 cut-off), 440 events were observed across the 
2 arms. The improvement in OS previously observed at the interim OS analysis (20 June 2019 cut-off) 
was maintained in the abemaciclib plus fulvestrant arm compared to the placebo plus fulvestrant arm, 
with a HR of 0.784 (95 % CI: 0.644, 0.955). Median OS was 45.8 months in the abemaciclib plus 
fulvestrant arm and 37.25 months in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. The OS results are presented in 
Figure 5.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Abemaciclib absorption is slow, with a Tmax of 8 hours and a mean absolute bioavailability of 
approximately 45 %. In the therapeutic dose range of 50 - 200 mg, the increase in plasma exposure 
(AUC) and Cmax is approximately dose proportional. Steady state was achieved within 5 days 
following repeated twice daily dosing, and abemaciclib accumulated with a geometric mean 
accumulation ratio of 3.7 (58 % CV) and 5.8 (65 % CV) based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. A 
high-fat meal increased combined AUC of abemaciclib and its active metabolites by 9 % and 
increased Cmax by 26 %. These changes were not considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, 
abemaciclib can be taken with or without food. 
Distribution 
Abemaciclib is highly bound to plasma proteins in humans (mean bound fraction approximately 96 % 
to 98 %). The geometric mean systemic volume of distribution is approximately 750 L (69 % CV), 
indicating distribution of abemaciclib into tissues. 
Concentrations of abemaciclib and its active metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid are comparable to 
unbound plasma concentrations.  
Biotransformation 
Hepatic metabolism is the main route of clearance for abemaciclib. Abemaciclib is metabolised to 
several metabolites primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The primary biotransformation is 
hydroxylation to a metabolite that circulates with an AUC that is 77 % of parent drug. In addition, 
N-desethyl and N-desethylhydroxy metabolites circulate at AUCs that are 39 % and 15 % of parent 
drug. These circulating metabolites are active with similar potency to abemaciclib. 
Elimination 
The geometric mean hepatic clearance (CL) of abemaciclib was 21.8 L/h (39.8 % CV), and the mean 
plasma elimination half-life for abemaciclib in patients was 24.8 hours (52.1 % CV). After a single 
oral dose of [14C] -abemaciclib, approximately 81 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and 3.4 % 
excreted in urine. The majority of the dose eliminated in faeces was metabolites.  
Special populations 
Age, gender, and body weight 
Age, gender, and body weight had no effect on the exposure of abemaciclib in a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with cancer (135 males and 859 females; age range 24 - 91 years; 
and body weight range 36 - 175 kg). 
Hepatic impairment 
Abemaciclib is metabolised in the liver. Mild (Child Pugh A) and moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic 
impairment had no effect on the exposure of abemaciclib. In subjects with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh C), the AUC0-∞ of abemaciclib and potency adjusted unbound abemaciclib plus its active 
metabolites increased 2.1-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively. The half-life of abemaciclib increased from 
24 to 55 hours (see section 4.2).  
Renal impairment 
Renal clearance of abemaciclib and its metabolites is minor. Mild and moderate renal impairment had 
no effect on the exposure of abemaciclib. There are no data in patients with severe renal impairment, 
end stage renal disease or in patients on dialysis. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
The primary target organ findings of potential relevance to humans occurred in the gastrointestinal 
tract, haematolymphopoietic organs, and male reproductive tract in mice, rats and dogs in studies up to 
13 weeks duration. Effects in eyes and heart valves occurred only in rodents at clinically relevant 
exposure levels. Effects in lung and skeletal muscle occurred only in rodents at exposure levels at least 
2-fold higher than human exposure levels. Effects in kidney occurred only in rodents at exposure 
levels at least 6-fold higher than human exposure levels. Complete or partial recovery was observed 
for all target organ findings at the end of the 28 - day recovery period, with the exception of male 
reproductive tract effects. 
Genotoxicity 
Abemaciclib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in 
an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and was not 
clastogenic in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. 
Carcinogenicity 
Abemaciclib was assessed for carcinogenicity in 2-year studies in rats and mice. In male rats, daily 
oral administration of abemaciclib resulted in benign testicular interstitial cell adenomas at exposures 
approximately 1.5 times human clinical exposure. In addition, interstitial cell hyperplasia was 
observed at exposures approximately 0.1 times human clinical exposure. It is unknown if these effects 
will translate to humans. There were no neoplastic findings in mice or in female rats that were due to 
administration of abemaciclib. 
Impairment of fertility 
Abemaciclib may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. In repeat-dose toxicity studies up 
to 3 months duration, abemaciclib-related findings in the testis, epididymis, prostate, and seminal 
vesicle included decreased organ weights, intratubular cellular debris, hypospermia, tubular dilatation, 
atrophy, and degeneration/necrosis. These effects occurred in rats and dogs at exposures 
approximately 2 and 0.02 times human clinical exposure, respectively. In a rat male fertility study, 
abemaciclib had no effects on reproductive performance. 
In a rat female fertility and early embryonic development study and in repeat-dose toxicity studies, 
abemaciclib did not have any effect on reproductive performance or any important effects on the 
female reproductive tract indicative of a risk of impaired fertility in females.  
Developmental toxicity 
Abemaciclib was teratogenic and caused decreased foetal weight at maternal exposures similar to the 
recommended human dose.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Verzenios is and what it is used for 
Verzenios is a cancer medicine containing the active substance abemaciclib. 
Abemaciclib blocks the effects of proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6. These proteins are 
abnormally active in some cancer cells and make them grow out of control. Blocking the action of 
these proteins can slow down growth of cancer cells, shrink the tumour and delay progression of the 
cancer.  
Verzenios is used to treat certain types of breast cancer (hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-)) which have: 
- 
spread to the lymph nodes of the armpit, with no detectable spread to other parts of the body, 
been surgically removed, and have certain characteristics that increase the risk of the cancer 
returning. Treatment is given in combination with hormonal therapy, such as aromatase 
inhibitors or tamoxifen, to prevent the cancer from coming back after surgery (treatment after 
surgery is called adjuvant therapy) 
spread beyond the original tumour and/or to other organs. It is given together with hormonal 
therapies, such as aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant. 
- 
2.  What you need to know before you take Verzenios  
Do not take Verzenios:  
- 
if you are allergic to abemaciclib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Verzenios may: 
- 
reduce the number of your white blood cells, and you may be at greater risk of getting an 
infection. Serious infections such as lung infections can be life-threatening; 
cause blood clots in the veins; 
cause severe or life-threatening inflammation of the lungs; 
affect the way your liver works; 
cause diarrhoea. At the first sign of diarrhoea, start treatment with antidiarrhoeal agents, such as 
loperamide. Drink plenty of fluids; 
cause blood clots in the arteries in patients also receiving hormone therapies. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
See section 4 “Possible side effects”, and talk to your doctor if you have any symptoms.  
What your doctor will check before and during your treatment 
You will have regular blood tests before and during treatment to check whether Verzenios affects your 
blood (white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets) or the concentration in your blood of enzymes from 
your liver.  
Children and adolescents 
Verzenios is not to be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Verzenios 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
In particular, tell you doctor or pharmacist before taking Verzenios if you are taking the following: 
• 
medicines that may increase the concentration of Verzenios in the blood: 
o  Clarithromycin (antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections) 
o  Itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole (used to treat fungal 
infections) 
o  Lopinavir/ritonavir (used to treat HIV/AIDS) 
o  Digoxin (used to treat heart disorders)  
o  Dabigatran etexilate (used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots) 
medicines that may reduce the effectiveness of Verzenios: 
• 
o  Carbamazepine (anti-epileptic used to treat seizures or fits) 
o  Rifampicin, used to treat tuberculosis (TB) 
o  Phenytoin (used to treat seizures) 
o  St. John’s wort (a herbal product used to treat mild depression and anxiety) 
Verzenios with food and drink 
Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice while you are taking the medicine as they may increase the 
concentration of Verzenios in the blood. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility  
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  
Pregnancy  
You should not use Verzenios if you are pregnant.  
You should avoid becoming pregnant while taking Verzenios.  
If you are able to have children, you should use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g., double –barrier 
contraception such as condom and diaphragm) during therapy and for at least 3 weeks after 
completing therapy. Discuss contraception with your doctor if there is any possibility that you may 
become pregnant. 
44

How to take Verzenios 
Recommended dose 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor

treatment temporarily or permanently.  
When and how to take Verzenios 
Take Verzenios twice daily, at about the same time every day, preferably in the morning and evening, 
so there is enough medicine in your body all the time. 
You can take the tablets either with or without food, just avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice (see 
section 2 “Verzenios with food and drink”). 
Swallow the tablet whole with a glass of water. Do not chew, crush or split the tablets before 
swallowing. 
How long to take Verzenios 
Take Verzenios continuously for as long as your doctor tells you to. If you take Verzenios for early 
breast cancer treatment, you should take it for up to 2 years. 
If you take more Verzenios than you should  
If you take too many tablets, or if someone else takes your medicine, contact a doctor or hospital for 
advice. Show the Verzenios carton and this leaflet. Medical treatment may be necessary.  
If you miss a dose of Verzenios  
If you vomit after taking the dose or forget a dose, take your next dose at your usual time. Do not take 
a double dose to make up for the forgotten or vomited dose. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you stop taking Verzenios  
Do not stop taking Verzenios unless your doctor tells you to.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

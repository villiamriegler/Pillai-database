2.    SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer with the highest incidence worldwide. The mortality 
rates are highest in males and second highest in females, after breast cancer1. In Europe, an estimated 
386300 cases of lung cancer were diagnosed in 2006; with 334800 deaths (20% of all cancer-related 
deaths) attributed to the disease2.  
The  genetic  predisposition  to  NSCLC  is  still  under  intensive  investigation,  however,  studies  have 
shown that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase (TK) and member 
of  the  erbB  family,  is  frequently  over-expressed and activated to  a  phosphorylated  state  in  NSCLC. 
The  activity  of  EGFR  in  cancer  cells  results  in  the  phosphorylation  of  downstream  proteins  that 
promote  cell  proliferation,  invasion,  metastasis,  and  inhibition  of  apoptosis3.  Targeting  the  EGFR 
pathway therefore constitutes a relevant strategy for cancer therapy. 
The  vast  majority  of  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  patients  will  subsequently  progress  after 
treatment with first line chemotherapy and the prognosis of these patients is poor, frequently suffering 
from symptomatic disease and a median survival of 4 to 5 months, if left untreated.  
Currently  commonly  used  treatments  in  the  EU  for  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  include 
bevacizumab  in  addition  to  platinum-based  chemotherapy  (1st  line  treatment),  docetaxel  (2nd  line 
treatment) and docetaxel in combination with cisplatin (1st line treatment), pemetrexed (1st and 2nd line 
treatment) and erlotinib (2nd and 3rd line treatment).  
In the initial application, AstraZeneca had submitted a marketing authorisation application (MAA) for 
the following indication: 
−  IRESSA  (gefitinib)  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  non-
small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  eligible  for  further  chemotherapy  after  receiving  prior 
platinum based chemotherapy. 
However,  following  the  assessment  and  objections  raised  by  the  CHMP,  a  new  indication  was 
proposed: 
−  IRESSA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations of EGFR-TK (see section 
5.1). 
The  recommended    posology  of  IRESSA  is  one  250 mg  tablet  once  a day.    If  a  dose of  IRESSA  is 
missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers.  If it is less than 12 hours to the next dose, 
the patient should not take the missed dose.  Patients should not take a double dose (two doses at the 
same time) to make up for a forgotten dose.

Gefitinib is a white, crystalline, non-hygroscopic powder. The processing conditions have been chosen 
to ensure that gefitinib is always produced as a single crystalline morphological form.  
Gefitinib doesn’t contain asymmetric carbon atoms. The drug substance exhibits basic properties, with 
two pKa values of 5.42 and 7.24, respectively.   
The solubility of gefitinib in aqueous solution is pH dependent. At pH 3 it is sparingly soluble, while it 
is  practically  insoluble  at  pH  7.  Gefitinib  is  freely  soluble  in  glacial  acetic  acid  and  in 
dimethylsulfoxide,  soluble  in  pyridine,  sparingly  soluble  in  tetrahydrofuran  and  slightly  soluble  in 
methanol, 
on 
permeability/absorption data and results from solubility studies, gefitinib has been classified as a low 
solubility, high permeability drug (class 2) according to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System 
(BCS System). 
The  chemical  structure  of  gefitinib  has  been  confirmed  using  analytical  data  by  elemental 
microanalysis, UV and IR spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry 
and X-ray crystallography. All data are consistent with the proposed structure.

Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder satisfactory describes the formulations used in clinical trials, the 
choice of the excipients and their amounts, the development of the dissolution test and evaluation of 
its discriminatory ability, the overages applied, the evaluation and optimisation of the manufacturing 
process, bioequivalence, and the choice of packaging material. 
The excipients were chosen based on the results from compatibility studies and consideration of the 
physico-mechanical  properties  of  the  drug  substance  together  with  those  of  the  excipients. 
Investigations have been carried out regarding the possibilities for minimising tablet size by increased 
drug  loading,  and  to  omit  microcrystalline  cellulose  as  a  second  diluent.  The  levels  of  binder, 
disintegrant and lubricant have also been optimised. 
•  Adventitious Agents 
All  excipients  except  lactose  monohydrate  are  produced  from  non-animal  sources.  The  lactose  is 
derived  from  milk  fit  for  human  consumption  and  a  satisfactory  statement  from  the  lactose 
monohydrate manufacturer has been submitted.  
•  Manufacture of the Product 
IRESSA  250  mg  film-coated  tablets  are  manufactured  using  a  conventional  wet  granulation, 
compression and film coating processes consisting of the following steps: dry mixing, wet granulation, 
drying,  tableting  and  coating.  All  critical  process  parameters  have  been  identified  and  controlled  by 
appropriate  in-process  controls.  The  manufacturing  process  demonstrates  to  be  reproducible  and 
provides a finished product that complies with the finished product specifications.  
•  Product Specification 
Appropriate drug product specifications have been set. All excipients used in the formulation comply 
with the monographs of the current Ph.Eur., except for yellow and red iron oxide which are referenced 
to USP/NF and JP. 
The specifications for the finished product at release and shelf life are the same and are classical for 
this  pharmaceutical  form.  They  include  tests  for  appearance,  identity,  assay,  degradation  products, 
dissolution, content uniformity, and microbial content. 
All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated, according to the 
state  of  the  art.  Appropriate  data  have  been  presented  to  justify  the  release  specifications  for  each 
quality  characteristic  that  is  controlled.  Batch  analysis  data  are  presented  for  42  production  scale 
batches manufactured at the commercial site during 2000-2007. All batches complied with the finished

•  Stability of the Product 
Stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  according  to  the  ICH  requirements  on  3  production  scale 
batches of drug product packaged in the commercial package and on one pilot batch packaged in the 
bulk  package.  All  batches  were  manufactured  by  the  commercial  manufacturer.  The  batches  in  the 
commercial package were stored at 25 °C/60 %RH and 30 °C/75 %RH for 48 months and at 40 °C/75 
%RH for 6 months, while the bulk batches were stored at 25 °C/60 %RH and 30 °C/75 %RH for 24 
months) and at 40 °C/75 %RH for 6 months. The parameters tested and analytical methods used were 
identical to those  used  for the release  specifications.  In  all  cases the  stability  results  presented  were 
satisfactory  and  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  for  the  commercially  packaged  product  under  the 
conditions specified in the SmPC.  
In use stability study results for one production batch packaged in PVC/Aluminium blisters with the 
foil wrap removed and stored for one month at 40 °C/75 %RH are also presented. The only change 
observed  during  storage  was  a  slight  increase  in  water  content,  confirming  that  the  drug  product  is 
stable for at least 30 days after opening of the foil-wrap. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of IRESSA is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical 
documentation  has  been  submitted  for  marketing  authorisation.  There  are  no  major  deviations  from 
EU requirements. 
The active substance is well characterised and documented. The manufacturing process of IRESSA is 
under  control  and  ensures  both  batch-to-batch  reproducibility  and  compliance  with  standard 
procedures  and  specifications.  The  analytical  methods  have  been  validated  and  ensure  consistent 
quality  of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  product,  the  synthetic  pathway  is  presented  and  the 
structure  and  impurity  profile  are  well  characterised  and  in  line  with  current  ICH  guidelines.  The 
stability data on the active substance supports the proposed re-testing period. 
The stability data of the finished product in the proposed package support the shelf life stated in the 
SmPC. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion there were no unresolved quality issues.  
2.3 
Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
All pivotal safety pharmacology and toxicology studies have been conducted in accordance with GLP 
regulations. GLP status has been confirmed for the majority of the pharmacokinetic studies.  
Pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
Inhibition of kinase activity 
Gefitinib inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide substrate by EGFR prepared from 
A431 human squamous carcinoma cells (IC50=0.033 µM) or by the isolated kinase domain of EGFR 
expressed  in  a  baculovirus  expression  system  (IC50=0.027  µM).  Gefitinib  acted  as  a  competitive 
inhibitor of ATP and a non-competitive inhibitor of peptide binding to EGFR TK . 
Inhibition of cell proliferation and EGFR autophosphorylation 
Cell growth was measured in the human KB cell line (derived from a vulval squamous tumour) using 
the MTT assay, and by cell counting and inhibition of EGF, FGF, and VEGF induced stimulation of 
HUVEC  cells  (isolated  from  umbilical  cords)  was  measured  using  [3H]thymidine  incorporation. 
Gefitinib  inhibited  EGF-stimulated  growth  with  IC50=0.054  µM,  more  than  100-fold  less  than  the 
inhibition of basal growth (IC50=8.8 µM). EGF-stimulated growth of human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells (HUVEC) was inhibited by gefitinib (IC50=0.03-0.1 µM), but FGF- and VEGF-stimulated growth 
Page 8 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was  relatively  unaffected  (IC50=1-3  µM).  The  effect  of  gefitinib  was  mainly  cytostatic,  but  higher 
doses increased apoptotic cell death. 
The  effect  of  gefitinib  on  EGF  induced  EGFR  autophosphorylation  was  measured  in  lysates  of 
different tumour-derived cell lines by electrophoresis and Western blotting with an antibody against 
tyrosine  phosphorylated  proteins.  Phosphorylation  was  reduced  to  control  levels  in  the  presence  of 
0.16  –  0.8  µM  gefitinib  and  reduced  EGF-induced  EGFR  autophosphorylation  in  a  concentration-
dependent manner in all tested cell types.  
Inhibition of downstream signalling 
The effects on EGFR autophosphorylation downstream signalling molecules (p-ERK and p-AKT), cell 
cycle progression (p27, a negative regulator of G1 to S transition; and BrdU incorporation, a measure 
of DNA synthesis) and apoptotic cell death (caspase 3) were assessed. In vitro studies were therefore 
conducted to clarify the effect of gefitinib on EGFR downstream signalling in wild type (WT) EGFR-
expressing  lung  tumour  cell  lines  with  different  sensitivities  to  gefitinib  (resistant  Calu-6,  sensitive 
Calu-3  and  hypersensitive  NCIH322  cell  lines)  and  the  PC-9  cell  line,  which  expresses  a  somatic 
activating  mutation  in  the  kinase  domain  of  EGFR  (delE746-A750)17  and  is  hypersensitive  to 
gefitinib,  was  also  examined.  Treatment  of  cells  with  gefitinib  showed  a  decreased  viability  and 
decreased  auto-phosphorylation  of  EGFR  and  the  effects  correlated  well  with  decreased  p-ERK,  p-
AKT  and  BrdU  incorporation  and  an  increase  in  p27  protein  expression.  Caspase-3  expression 
remained mostly unchanged in cells Calu-6, Calu-3 and NCIH322. Therefore, it appears that the cell 
line with mutated EGFR is more dependent on apoptosis than the cells with wild-type EGFR. 
In vivo anti-tumour activity 
The in vivo activity on tumour growth was studied in xenograft models. Gefitinib inhibited the growth 
of different tumours to a variable degree. Effective dose-dependent growth inhibition was seen with 
A431 (vulval squamous carcinoma), A546 (lung tumour) and Du145 (prostate tumour) where gefitinib 
inhibited tumour growth in a dose-dependent manner. The susceptibility to growth inhibition did not 
correlate with EGFR expression in the different cell types. Gefitinib had a cytostatic effect on tumour 
growth.  The  importance  of  continuous  drug  treatment  to  maintain  tumour  activity  was  examined  in 
studies  where  gefitinib  therapy  (200  mg/kg)  was  withdrawn  after  50  or  more  consecutive  days  of 
administration. Results demonstrated a persistent tumour inhibitory effect, which was reversible upon 
cessation of treatment even after a long period of treatment (> 100 days). 
Metabolites 
The pharmacological activity of metabolites and potential metabolites of gefitinib was evaluated using 
in  vitro  kinase  assay  and  the  MTT  assay  in  the  human  KB  cell  line.  Five  metabolites  identified  in 
humans were studied for pharmacological activity. All metabolites demonstrated potent and selective 
EGFR  TK  inhibition,  similar  to  that  of  gefitinib.  The  activity  of  the  major  human  metabolite, 
M523595,  was  further  studied  in  an  in  vivo  xenograft  model  (LoVo  tumour  bearing  nude  female 
mice).  Comparing  gefitinib  at  75  mg/kg  and  M523595  at  150  mg/kg,  gefitinib  showed  significant 
inhibition of tumour growth while M523595 had no effect on tumour growth. While plasma exposures 
of the two compounds were comparable, tumour concentrations of M523595 were approximately 7-
times lower than those of gefitinib. The metabolites are unlikely to contribute in a significant manner 
to the pharmacological activity of gefitinib.  
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Affinity of gefitinib to various secondary enzymes and receptors has been screened, using enzyme and 
radioligand binding assays (TSY276, non-GLP). Activity against the structurally closely related HER-
family  member  erbB2  was  100-fold  less  than  that  against  EGFR  TK  and,  had  little  or  no  activity 
against the receptors for vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), KDR and c-flt. Gefitinib did 
not inhibit the activity of any of the serine/threonine kinases raf, MEK-1 and ERK-2 (MAPK). 
•  Safety pharmacology programme 
Studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  gefitinib  on  gastrointestinal  (rat,  GI  transit), 
respiratory  (rat,  plethysmography),  central  nervous  system  (rat,  Functional  Observation  Battery  and 
Page 9 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
locomotor activity) and cardiovascular (dog, telemetry) functions. In vitro studies were performed to 
evaluate effects on cardiac action potential (dog Purkinje fibres and hERG expressing cells). In the rat 
studies,  gefitinib  was administered  orally  at  single  doses  of  5,  50  and  500  mg/kg.  In  the  dog  study, 
gefitinib was administered orally at single doses of 5 and 50 mg/kg 
No  effects  were  seen  on  the  gastro-intestinal function.  Minimal  effects  were seen  on the  respiratory 
system at 50 and 500 mg/kg (decreases in peak inspiratory flow, peak expiratory flow, tidal volume 
and  minute  volume.  Minor  effects  were  seen  on  the  central  nervous  system  at  50  and  500  mg/kg 
(slight reduction in motor activity). Minor effects were seen on the cardiovascular system at 50 mg/kg 
(slight hypotension). 
Gefitinib  was  active  in  the  hERG  assay  with  an  IC50  of  1  µM  (446  ng/ml).  Gefitinib  induced  a 
statistical significant prolongation of the action potential duration at 90% of repolarisation (APD90) in 
a  dog  Purkinje  fibre  preparation  at  3462  ng/ml  (protein free  levels).  At  a low stimulation  frequency 
(0.33 Hz) the degree of prolongation was increased only at the higher concentrations of gefitinib.  At 
exposure levels of gefitinib in clinical use, however, the conditions do not suggest an increased risk of 
action potential prolongation. In a QT interval assessment in conscious telemetered dogs, there were 
no statistical significant increases of QT or QTc intervals in dogs treated with gefitinib at either 5 or 
50  mg/kg.  However,  examination  of  the  individual  data  shows  that  at  2  hours post-dose,  1  out  of  6 
dogs at 5 mg/kg and 2 out of 6 dogs at 50 mg/kg experienced a greater than 10% QTc prolongation in 
comparison to baseline values. No dogs receiving the vehicle showed such a change. 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
A number of interaction studies were submitted to explore the effects of gefitinib and certain cytotoxic 
drugs in vitro and in vivo on tumour cell growth (data not shown). 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  majority  of  the  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  were  conducted  at  dose  levels  of  5 
mg/kg,  which  was  the  intermediate  dose  level  in  the  6-month  oral  toxicity  studies  in  these  species. 
Some  studies  were  however  performed  with  higher  dose  levels  (20-50  mg/kg),  in  order  to  facilitate 
metabolite identification. 
•  Methods of analysis 
A high performance liquid chromatography method with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) assay was 
developed  for  determination  of  concentrations  of  gefitinib  in  rat  and  dog  plasma.  A  more  sensitive 
method  with  HPLC  with  tandem  mass  spectrometric  detection  (HPLC-MS-MS)  was  developed  for 
clinical  analysis  of  gefitinib  and  for  measurement  of  known  metabolites  (M537194,  M527301, 
M295820,  M523595  and  M387783)  in  plasma  from  rat,  dog  and  man.  For  radiochemical  analysis, 
gefitinib was [14C]labelled either in the propoxy chain (KML002, KML032, KML039, KML042) or 
in the chlorofluorophenyl ring. Radiochemical purity >98% was determined by TLC and HPLC. 
•  Absorption 
Assessment  of  oral  absorption  by  comparison  of  urinary  excretion  of  radioactivity  following 
administration of single oral and/or intravenous doses of [14C]-gefitinib was considered inappropriate 
since recovery from urine was low. Bioavailability was estimated from plasma pharmacokinetic data. 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  after  single  oral  and  intravenous  administrations  to  rats  and  dogs  are 
summarised in Table 1. Data from single dose studies in humans are included.

Two  studies  on  single  dose  kinetics  have  been  performed  in  rats  (KKR008  and  KPR055),  with 
intravenous and peroral doses in the range 5-20 mg/kg and two more studies on single dose kinetics 
were  performed  with  3  male  dogs,  both  with  5  mg/kg  gefitinib administered  orally  or  intravenously 
(KKD009  and  KPD050)  (Table  1).  Both  studies  in  rats  demonstrated  higher  levels  of  exposure  in 
females than in males, with female AUC levels 1.4-2 times male AUC levels. AUC levels were shown 
to  increase  in  a  non-proportional  manner  and  bioavailability  of  gefitinib  increased  with  increasing 
dose,  indicating  increased  absorption  or  saturation  of  first  pass  metabolism.  There  was  gender 
difference  in  rats,  with  female  rats  showing  an  exposure  approximately  double  that  in  male  rats. 
Gefitinib was extensively distributed in both sexes, with apparent volumes of distribution calculated to 
8-10.4 l/kg. Mean terminal half-life in dogs was 3-8 hours. Apparent volume of distribution was found 
to be smaller than in rats, 2.1-6.3 l/kg. Gefitinib was cleared from dog plasma at 10-16 ml/min/kg.

The  effect  of  food  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  gefitinib  was  examined  in  male  dogs  dosed  with  a 
single  100  mg  gefitinib  tablet  (KPD025,  Table  1).  Peak  plasma  concentrations  were  greater  when 
gefitinib  was  administered  after  feeding,  and  inter  individual  variability  decreased.  However,  no 
evidence of a food effect on the pharmacokinetics of gefitinib in dogs was found. 
Studies  of  repeat  dose  kinetics  were  conducted  during  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  mice,  rats  and 
dogs as part of the toxicokinetics programme. Exposure in male rats was lower than in females, but no 
obvious sex difference was observed in dogs.  
Following  oral  and  intravenous  administration  of  [14C]-gefitinib,  elimination  of  radioactivity  into 
urine was low (<7.5%) in all species. However, high levels of radioactivity were recovered in faeces 
of rats (96-98%), dogs (72-86%), and rabbits (94%).  
•  Distribution 
Tissue distribution, plasma protein binding, tumour xenograft distribution, transplacental distribution, 
and  distribution  in  blood  have  been  examined  in vitro  and  in  vivo  after  oral  dosing  of  radiolabelled 
gefitinib.    Except  for  KPJ013,  KMR010,  KMR051  and  KMR016  none  of  the  studies  were  GLP 
compliant.  Radiolabelled  material  was  rapidly  absorbed  and  widely  distributed  into  the  tissues 
following administration of a 5 mg/kg single oral dose of [14C]-gefitinib to albino and pigmented male 
rats, with readily detectable levels of radioactivity still present 96 h after dosing. Peak concentrations 
of radioactivity were achieved at 2 h after dosing and were highest in the organs of metabolism and 
excretion  (liver,  kidney,  lung,  GI  tract)  and  in  glandular  tissue  (lachrymal  gland,  salivary  gland, 
adrenal glands), low levels of radioactivity distributed within the central nervous system and the testis.  
Radioactivity  was  extensively  distributed  into  tumours  and  normal  tissues  of  nude  mice  bearing 
subcutaneous human tumour (LoVo - colorectal; A549 and Calu-6 - lung) with the mean peak tumour 
concentration being achieved 2-8 h after dosing.  Most of the tumour radioactivity was accounted for 
by unchanged gefitinib. The apparent elimination half-life of ZD1839 was 3.1 to 3.3 h in plasma and 
in the range of 4.7 to 5.8 h in tumour xenografts.  Concentrations of gefitinib in blood was evaluated in 
the rat and dog following administration of single oral and intravenous doses of [14C]-gefitinib. The 
blood:plasma  concentration  ratio  was  approximately  1:0.8  in  both  males  and  females  and  across  all 
dose groups (oral: 5 and 12.5 mg/kg; i.v: 5 mg/kg). In contrast, the blood:plasma concentration ratio in 
the dog was approximately 1:1.6 following both oral and intravenous doses at 5 mg/kg, indicating a 
minimal distribution of gefitinib and its metabolites to the cellular components of blood.   
Using the MDR1-MDCK cell monolayer system, gefitinib was shown to be a good substrate for Pgp-
dependent transport, although it had no obvious potency as an inhibitor of Pgp-mediated efflux. The in 
vivo effects of this property were assessed in an in situ rat brain penetration model, which showed that 
gefitinib  at  0.5  µM  exhibited  low  brain  permeation  due  to  Pgp-mediated  efflux.  However,  brain 
penetration was increased 3-fold by cyclosporin A (10 µM). Gefitinib has been shown to be a substrate 
and inhibitor of the BCRP (ABCG2) transporter, both in vitro and in vivo, with an inhibition of BCRP 
that is 10-fold higher than that for Pgp. 
Transplacental transfer of radioactivity was investigated following administration of single oral doses 
(5 mg/kg) of [14C]-gefitinib to pregnant rats and rabbits. It was shown that placental transfer of drug-
related material readily occurs in both rat and rabbit. 
•  Metabolism 
The  in  vitro  metabolism  of  gefitinib  was  investigated  by  incubating  [14C]-gefitinib  with  rat,  dog  or 
human  hepatocytes.  There  was  extensive  metabolism  to  a  large  number  of  components,  with 
unchanged gefitinib accounting for 55% (rat), 28% (dog) or 34-81% (human) after a 3 hr incubation. 
The  main  metabolites  detected  in  vivo  are  shown  in  figure  1.  The  chromatographic  pattern  of  the 
metabolites suggested that the major metabolites were similar in the three species.

Three distinct metabolites were formed after incubation with human hepatic microsomes and two were 
identified  as  M537194  and  M387783.  These  were  isolated  and  analysed  by  mass  spectrometry  and 
nuclear  magnetic  resonance  spectroscopy.  A  further  study  on  the  metabolism  of  gefitinib  and 
M387783, M537194 and M52395 (the main metabolites found in man) led to the identification of 14 
more  metabolites. In vivo metabolism studies were performed in rats, dogs and humans. Circulating 
levels of metabolites were low and the major route of excretion was into faeces. Metabolite profiling 
from faecal extracts showed that in rat, gefitinib and M537194 were the major components identified 
in  faeces.  In  dog,  a  number  of  components  were  identified  including  gefitinib, M537194,  M523595 
and M387783, together with hydroxylated, dihydroxylated and carboxypropyl metabolites of gefitinib.  
P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of gefitinib were identified by the use of selective inhibitors 
and in vitro studies using microsomal fractions from cells expressing individual P450 enzymes. These 
studies  showed  that  gefitinib  was  metabolised  through  the  action  of  CYP3A4  and  CYP2D6. 
Metabolism was also observed with CYP3A5, but to a lesser extent. In the presence of CYP2D6, there 
was rapid metabolism of gefitinib with M523595 as the predominant metabolite. 
The effect of selective inhibitors on the metabolism of [14C]-gefitinib is summarised in Table 2. The 
formation of metabolites M387783 and M537194 were markedly reduced by ketoconazole, a selective 
inhibitor of CYP3A4. The inhibition of CYP2C19 by omeprazole reduced the formation of M537194. 
Inhibition  of  CYP2D6  by  quinidine  resulted in  a  significant  reduction  of  M523595,  confirming  that 
M523595 is catalysed almost exclusively by CYP2D6.

The  potential  of  gefitinib  to  inhibit  the  activity  of  the  major  human  P450  enzymes  was  studied  in 
human hepatic microsomes in vitro.  Gefitinib produced little inhibition (< 10%) of CYP1A2, 2C9 and 
3A4  enzyme  activity.  Inhibition of  CYP2C19  and  2D6  was  more  pronounced,  with  enzyme  activity 
decreased to 76% and 57% of control at maximum gefitinib concentration (5 µg/ml), respectively. 
•  Excretion 
Excretion was primarily via the faeces (>90% of recovered dose) after oral and intravenous dosing in 
rats, rabbits and dogs. Elimination was relatively slow. The proportion of the dose being recovered in 
the first 24 hours was 70% in rats, 51% in rabbits and 40% in dogs.  
Following administration of a single oral dose (5 mg/kg) of 14C-gefitinib to lactating rats, drug-related 
material  was  excreted  in  milk  with  peak  concentrations  observed  at  4  hours  post-dose.  The  major 
component in the milk was gefitinib with concentrations of 11 to 19 fold higher than in blood. 
Toxicology 
All pivotal toxicity studies were conducted in accordance with GLP criteria. The toxicity of gefitinib 
was assessed in a standard program of non-clinical safety evaluation with repeat-dose toxicity studies 
in rats and dogs up to 12 months in duration, standard reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, 
genotoxicity studies and studies of antigenic potential.  
•  Single dose toxicity 
The single dose toxicity of gefitinib was assessed in mice and rats in oral and IV administration routes 
and dogs in oral administration route only. Studies in rats showed that an oral dose of 2000 mg/kg led 
to severe adverse effects 5 days after treatment related to a perforated duodenal ulcer, which lead to 
premature deaths in females. There were other major findings, including damage to kidneys, liver, skin 
and  upper  gastro-intestinal  tract.  Both  mice  and  rats  tolerated  20  mg/kg  IV  administration  without 
signs of toxicity. In studies of single oral toxicity in dogs, doses of up to 1000 mg/kg did not induce 
death  but  caused  adverse  effects  which  were  rapid  at  onset  but  reversible.  These  effects  include 
emesis, diarrhoea, loss of skin tone, reduced blood pressure, reduced appetite, loss of body weight and 
increased plasma ALT, AST and ALP activities. 
•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
The repeat-dose toxicity studies of gefitinib was evaluated in rats (daily dosing for 2 to 4 weeks and 6 
months) and in dogs (daily dosing for 2 weeks and 1, 6, 12 months) following oral administration and 
by  intravenous  administration  (daily  dosing  for  14  days  and  7  to  14  days,  respectively).  For  rats 
studies,  oral  doses  from  0-125  mg/kg/d  for  the  2week  repeat  study,  0-40  mg/kg/d  for  the  1  month 
repeat study and 0-25 mg/kg/d for the 6 month repeat study demonstrated severe toxicity at high doses 
and  a  NOAEL  of  10  mg/kg/d  whereas  for  IV  administration,  high  and  intermediate  doses  showed 
similar lesions as the oral studies, with a NOAEL of 1 mg/kg/d. For dog toxicity studies, oral doses 
from 0-75 mg/kg/d for the 2 week repeat study and 0-40 mg/kg/d for the 1 repeat month study and 0-
25 mg/kg/d for the 6 month repeat study showed severe toxicity at high doses and a NOAEL of 1-10 
mg/kg/d. In the 6 months studies, the high-dose of 25 mg/kg/day had to be reduced to 15 mg/kg/day 
Page 14 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from day 11 in dogs and from week 9 in rats. In addition, repeat-dose studies were performed in mice 
for a carcinogenicity study. The toxicity findings in a number of target organs were mostly attributed 
to the pharmacological effects of gefitinib. The target organs affected were: 
Ovary 
While the effect was reversible, there was a reduction in the weight of ovaries and an increase in the 
number  of  corpora  lutea  seen  at  higher  doses  in  rats  in  the  one  month  and  six  month  oral  toxicity 
studies. There was also reduced female fertility in rats at 20 mg/kg.  
Eye  
There was reversible corneal epithelial atrophy observed in the one month studies in rats and dogs. In 
studies  in  dogs,  residual  corneal  translucency  remained  even  after  the  recovery  period.  The 
histopathological changes observed were corneal epithelial atrophies without ulceration, inflammation 
and epidermal microabscesses of the eyelids with folliculitis and degeneration of hair follicles. Similar 
changes were found in the 6/12 month studies for both rat and dog. However, in the dog studies, the 
corneal translucencies progressed to corneal opacities which did not reverse.  
Skin  
There  were  skin  changes  observed  in  studies  of  rats  and  dogs.  The  changes  were  partly  or  fully 
reversible after recovery.  
Haematologic parameters 
There  was  an  observed  increase  in  white  blood  cell  counts  and  decrease  red  cell  parameters  were 
considered to be secondary to the skin lesions. 
Kidney  
In  the  kidneys,  renal  papillary  necrosis  was observed in  studies  with  high-doses  of  gefitinib in  both 
rats and dogs. These changes were partially reversible in rats. 
Liver 
In  the  liver,  in  addition  to  increases  in  plasma  liver  enzymes  (ALP,  AST  and  AST),  hepatocellular 
necrosis  and  eosinophilic  sinusoidal  macrophage  infiltration  were  observed  in  the  rat  studies  at  6 
months at doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg (reduced to 15 mg/kg at 9 weeks). In dog studies, there was no 
increase in liver enzymes.  
Gastro-intestinal tract 
There  was  villous  stunting  and  ulceration  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  observed  in  rats  after  a  single 
2000  mg/kg  dose.  In  a  rat  14  day  study,  villous  atrophy  was  observed  at  50  and  125  mg/kg.  There 
were no salient findings in the GI tract in rats in the 1 and 6 month studies. In oral toxicity studies in 
dog, no salient findings were reported with a histopathological correlate.  
Heart 
There were observation of lengthened PR intervals and one case of second degree heart block in the 1 
month oral toxicity study in dogs. In the 6 month study, one dog in the 25 mg/kg (reduced to 15 mg/kg 
at 9 weeks) dose group showed a PR interval prolongation.  
•  Genotoxicity 
There  was  no  evidence  for  a  genotoxic  potential  of  gefitinib  when  studied  in  a  standard  battery  of 
genotoxicity assays. Gefitinib containing 1% of the impurity gefitinib 4-isomer showed no effects in in 
vitro assays for mutagenicity and clastogenicity. 
•  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  performed  in  mice  and  rats.  There  was  a  small  increase  in  the 
incidence of hepatic adenoma in male mice at the mid and high dose and in female mice at the high 
dose.  An increase in hepatic adenoma was also observed in male and female rats at the high dose. An 
increased incidence in haemangiosarcoma of the mesenteric lymph node was observed in female rats 
at the high dose (10mg/kg/day) only.  At no-effect levels there was no margin to clinical exposure.

•  Reproduction Toxicity 
There  was  no  evidence  of  teratogenicity  in  the  rat  and  rabbit  in  developmental  studies  below 
maternally toxic doses.  
•  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics  data  were  reported  from  most  of  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies.  There  was  gender 
differences  observed  after  a  single  dose  with  higher  exposure  observed  in  female  rats.  There  was 
accumulation of toxicity observed after repeated oral dosing in most studies (3 to 4 fold in rat, 1.3 to 
1.7  fold  in  dogs).  The  exposure  levels  (AUC)  were  relatively  similar  between  rats  and  dogs  at  the 
same doses. There were no clear safety margins as most of the toxicity findings in the animal studies 
occurred at exposures under the expected clinical exposure 
•  Local tolerance  
Phototoxicity  studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  the  phototoxicity  of  gefitinib.  Gefitinib  was 
phototoxic to Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts with a Photo Irritation Factor (PIF) of 11.62. Gefitinib showed no 
photoallergenic potential in guinea pig.  There were no photogenotoxic studies performed. 
•  Other toxicity studies 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment has been performed, and there are no indications that gefitinib pose 
a significant risk to the environment.  
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The results from non-clinical studies support the oral formulation of the dose administered once daily.  
The PD studies submitted suggest that gefitinib may have a cytostatic effect on tumour cell growth, 
and  highlight  the  importance  of  continuous  treatment  to  maintain  antitumour  activity.    Complete 
inhibition of tumour growth was only observed at doses approximately 40 times the human therapeutic 
dose (5 mg/kg). The antitumour effect was not observed in all in vivo xenograft models, in spite of the 
excessive  doses  of  gefitinib  administered.  The  inhibition  of  tumour  growth  was  small  or  absent  in 
xenografts  derived  from  pancreatic,  bronco-epithelial,  gastric,  or  breast  tissue.  It  is  suggested  that 
other members of the ErbB family, who heterodimerise with ErbB1, may play a role in determining 
gefitinib  sensitivity  and  resistance.  There  were  several  cell  lines  with  either  mutated  or  WT  EGFR 
displaying different sensitivities to gefitinib. There was no clear difference between any of the factors 
related  to  cellular  proliferation  and  inhibition  of  cell  cycle  progression  that  could  account  for  the 
resistant  phenotype.  However,  cell  lines  with  WT  EGFR  displayed  differences  in  factors  associated 
with  apoptosis  when  treated  with  gefitinib.  Therefore,  the  results  indicate  that  gefitinib  may  affect 
several intracellular signalling cascades and impact on tumour growth. 
Based on the studies with the radiotracer gefitinib, the major organs affected for toxicity are the liver, 
kidney, bone marrow, spleen, as well as glandular tissue. Distribution of gefitinib and its metabolites 
into tumour xenografts were extensively studied and results showed that the level of radioactivity were 
higher in tumours than plasma  and  was significantly  lower  in  other  tissues (liver,  kidney  and  lung).  
The role of gefitinib in P-gp transport was assessed both in an in vitro cell monolayer study and in an 
in situ brain penetration study. Gefitinib was shown to be a substrate for P-gp dependent transport, and 
results from the in situ study indicate that gefitinib limit P-gp mediated efflux.  
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to the 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows (See SmPC section 
5.3):

− 
Corneal epithelia atrophy and corneal translucencies 
Renal papillary necrosis 
Hepatocellular necrosis and eosinophilic sinusoidal macrophage infiltration 
Data from in vitro studies indicate that gefitinib has the potential to inhibit cardiac repolarization (e.g. 
QT interval). There was an observation that gefitinib could lengthen PR intervals, and consequently 
Page 16 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
affect  heart  function.  Three  non-clinical  assays  were  performed  to  investigate  the  potential  for  QT 
prolongation.  The dog Purkinje fibre assessments and the hERG assay showed a clear dose response 
relationship  with  increasing  gefitinib  concentrations.    Although  the  dog  telemetry  study  showed  no 
statistically  significant  effects  on  QTc,  a  proportion  of  individual  dogs  receiving  gefitinib  showed 
some evidence of prolonged QTc. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown (See SmPC 
section 5.3) 
A reduction in female fertility was observed in the rat at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (See SmPC section 
5.3). 
Published  studies  have  shown  that  genetically  modified  mice,  lacking  expression  of  EGFR,  exhibit 
developmental  defects,  related  to  epithelial  immaturity  in  a  variety  of  organs  including  the  skin, 
gastrointestinal  tract  and  lung.  When  gefitinib  was  administered  to  rats  during  organogenesis,  there 
were  no  effects  on  embryofoetal  development  at  the  highest  dose  (30 mg/kg/day).  However,  in  the 
rabbit,  there  were  reduced  foetal  weights  at  20 mg/kg/day  and  above.  There  were  no  compound-
induced  malformations  in  either  species.  When  administered  to  the  rat  throughout  gestation  and 
parturition, there was a reduction in pup survival at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (See SmPC section 5.3). 
Following  oral  administration  of  C-14  labelled  gefitinib  to  lactating  rats  14  days  post  partum, 
concentrations of radioactivity in milk were 11-19 fold higher than in blood (See SmPC section 5.3). 
It  is  not  known  whether  gefitinib  is  secreted  in  human  milk.    Gefitinib  and  metabolites  of  gefitinib 
accumulated  in  milk  of  lactating  rats  (see  SmPC  section  5.3).    IRESSA  is  contraindicated  during 
breast-feeding  and  therefore  breast-feeding  must  be  discontinued  while  receiving  IRESSA  therapy 
(see SmPC sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
IRESSA is contraindicated for patients that are hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of the 
excipients (see SmPC section 4.3). 
The toxicity of gefitinib was assessed in all major organs. In repeat dose studies, toxicity was mainly 
observed  in  the  ovaries,  eyes,  skin,  kidney,  liver  and  the  gastro-intestinal  tract.  There  was  some 
toxicity  observed  in  the  liver.  The  effects  of  gefitinib  may  be  linked  to  the  role  of  EGF  in  the 
regulation of normal function in these organs. For example, it is known that EGFR is involved in the 
regulation of ovarian function, lachrymal gland function, ocular homeostasis, gastrointestinal function, 
keratinocyte and hair follicle development and the integrity of the skin structure. EGF is also produced 
in the kidney as a growth factor for the regulation of epithelial cells in the kidney and urinary tract.  
There was a lack of teratogenicity and no genotoxic potential was found in mice with gefitinib (see 
SmPC  section  5.3).  Given  the  known  importance  of  EGFR  in  embryonic  development  this  was 
unexpected  since  mice  lacking  EGFR  exhibit  developmental  defects.  Therefore,  because  of 
mechanistic  considerations  it  is  suggested  that  a  potential  for  teratogenicity  still  exists  and  gefitinib 
should  not be  used  during  pregnancy  unless  necessary.  Furthermore,  studies in animals  have  shown 
reproductive toxicity. The potential risk for humans is unknown. IRESSA should not be used during 
pregnancy unless clearly necessary, and women of childbearing potential must be advised not to get 
pregnant during therapy (see SmPC sections 4.6 and  5.3). 
Gefitinib showed no genotoxic potential. 
A  2-year  carcinogenicity  study  in  rats  resulted  in  a  small  but  statistically  significant  increased 
incidence  of  hepatocellular  adenomas  in  both  male  and  female  rats  and  mesenteric  lymph  node 
haemangiosarcomas  in  female  rats  at  the  highest  dose  (10mg/kg/day)  only.  The  hepatocellular 
adenomas  were  also  seen  in  a  2-year  carcinogenicity  study  in  mice,  which  demonstrated  a  small 
increased incidence of this finding in male mice  at the mid dose, and in both male and female mice at 
the highest dose. The effects reached statistical significance for the female mice, but not for the males.  
At  no-effect  levels  in  both  mice  and  rats  there  was  no  margin  in  clinical  exposure.    The  clinical 
relevance of these findings is unknown (See SmPC sedction 5.3).  
Page 17 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results of an in vitro phototoxicity study demonstrated that gefitinib may have phototoxicity 
potential (See SmPC sedction 5.3). 
In conclusion, a number of target organs have been identified. There are no safety margins and these 
toxic events can therefore be expected to occur in the clinical situation. The safety evaluation must be 
based on clinical safety documentation and a well-performed monitoring of toxicity to those organs, 
which have been identified as potential target organs for toxicity. The toxicity studies were performed 
at doses up to maximal tolerated dose.  
2.4 
Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The applicant originally sought a MAA in Europe in February 2003 for the indication “treatment of 
patients  with  locally  or  advanced  metastatic  Non-Small  Cell  Lung  Cancer  (NSCLC)  who  are 
refractory to both platinum-containing and docetaxel chemotherapy” but withdrew the application in 
January 2005.   
For the current MAA, the applicant has submitted a pivotal Phase III study (INTEREST) and a Phase 
III  study  in  a  selected  patient  population  in  first  line  treatment  (IPASS).  The  applicant  has  also 
submitted three supportive studies; V-15-32 – a Phase III study, SIGN – a Phase II symptom control 
study, and ISTANA – a Phase III study. 
There is no paediatric development programme for gefitinib. There is no relevant indication for use of 
IRESSA in children and adolescents. 
The  tablet  may  be  taken  with  or  without  food,  at  about  the  same  time  each  day.  The  tablet  can  be 
swallowed  whole  with  some  water  or  if  dosing  of  whole  tablets  is  not  possible,  tablets  may  be 
administered  as  a  dispersion  in  water  (non-carbonated).  No  other  liquids  should  be  used.  Without 
crushing it, the tablet should be dropped in half a glass of drinking water.  The glass should be swirled 
occasionally, until the tablet is dispersed (this may take up to 20 minutes). The dispersion should be 
drunk  immediately  after  dispersion  is  complete  (i.e.  within  60  minutes).  The  glass  should  be  rinsed 
with  half  a  glass  of  water,  which  should  also  be  drunk.  The  dispersion  can  also  be  administered 
through a naso-gastric or gastrostomy tube (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The  INTEREST  study  was  reviewed  as  part  of  a  European  Scientific  Advice  in  the  context  of  the 
follow-on study IDENTIFY, concerning parts of the development plan for gefitinib in early 2006 (Ref: 
EMEA/H/SA/137/4/2006/11). The CHMP advised the applicant that a large unrestricted indication in 
all patients would be of concern if the positive benefit would be limited in relation to EGFR FISH+ 
status, thus, it would be necessary that efficacy be demonstrated in the overall population. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
A GCP inspection was carried out at 3 investigator sites in China involved in the INTEREST study. 
The final report of the GCP inspection concluded that there were no critical findings but noted 3 major 
deviations  on  the  quality  of  the  sponsors  monitoring,  the  incomplete  and  inaccurate  drug 
accountability and the inadequate process for updating informed consent during the study. However, 
the  findings  were  found  not  have  any  detrimental  impact  on  the  well-being  of  the  patients  or  the 
quality of the data. The data presented were accurately described and could be accepted for evaluation.

•  Absorption  
Gefitinib  was  slowly  absorbed  after  an  oral  administration  of  tablets  and  capsules  under  fasting 
conditions.  In  the  majority  of  the  individuals  the  maximum  plasma  concentrations  were  observed 
between 3-7 h post-dose. Following oral administration of gefitinib, absorption is moderately slow and 
peak plasma concentrations of gefitinib typically occur at 3 to 7 hours after administration. The mean 
AUC values (ng.h/mL) in healthy volunteers were 434, 940, 2631 and 5768 ng.h/mL for 50, 100, 250 
and 500 mg, respectively. The trapezoidal area under the curve AUC(0-t) accounted for more than 80% 
of the total AUC for the majority of the plasma concentration-time profiles, indicating that the profiles 
had  been  well  defined.  The  mean  Cmax  values  in  the  healthy  volunteers  were  14.3,  35.3,  104.5  and 
199.9 ng/ml for 50, 100, 250 and 500 mg, respectively. The data from cancer patients, which received 
the same dose, showed that AUC and Cmax achieved was generally higher than that achieved in healthy 
volunteers.  
The absolute bioavailability of the 250 mg oral dose of gefitinib was assessed in two Phase I clinical 
studies,  0031  and  0035.  Study  0031  was  performed  in  healthy  volunteers  and  study  0035  was 
performed  in  patients  with  advanced  solid  tumours.  In  both  studies,  subjects  received  i.v.  and  oral 
doses of gefitinib. The bioavailability data from study 0031 are limited because the study design was 
amended  following  reports  of  adverse  events  at  the  infusion  site  (thrombophlebitis  and  rash).    The 
calculation of the absolute bioavailability in both studies was based on the individual AUC data for the 
oral and i.v. doses. For the six volunteers in study 0031, the gmean absolute bioavailability was 57.2% 
with a 90% confidence interval of 48.5 to 67.5%. The absolute bioavailability in cancer patients was 
approximately 59.1%, with a 90% CI of 50.8 to 68.7%. In study 0229, the relative bioavailability of 
gefitinib 250 mg when administered as a tablet or  as a tablet dispersion preparation (drink and tube 
administered) was determined in 18 healthy male volunteers. The pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, 
Cmax, tmax and t½) were similar following each method of administration of a single 250 mg tablet.  
The  influence  of  food  on  the  relative  bioavailability  of  gefitinib  tablets  was  assessed  in  healthy 
volunteers in study 0002 and study 0036. The study 002 was performed using a dose of 50 mg and 
0036 was performed using the relevant clinical dose of 250 mg. In both studies, volunteers were given 
a  high-fat  breakfast  within  30  minutes  before  receiving  the  dose.  In  study  0036  the  effect  of  a 
sustained elevation of gastric pH >5 on the relative bioavailability of gefitinib tablets was investigated 
since this study used the clinical relevant dose. Results from the two studies showed some disparity as 
the tmax was slightly higher in the fed group compared to fasted in the 002 study and no difference in 
the 036 study, the AUC and Cmax in study 0002 decreased (by 14%  and 34 %, respectively) after a fat-
rich meal, while the AUC and Cmax in study 0036 increased (by 37 % and 32 %, respectively) after a 
fat-rich  meal.  The  overall  effect  of  the  sustained  elevation  in  gastric  pH  (greater  than  5)  was  a 
reduction  in  the  relative  bioavailability  of  the  gefitinib  tablet  by  47%  and  is  therefore  of  clinical 
relevance.  
The  study  0036  had  two  groups  of  volunteers  with  a  crossover  design.  Group  1  consisted  of  26 
volunteers, who received either 250 mg gefitinib under fasted conditions or 250 mg gefitinib following 
a  high  fat  breakfast  (1262  kcal).  Group  2  consisted  of  26  volunteers,  who  received  either  two  oral 
doses  of  450  mg  ranitidine  (13  h  and  1  h  before  the  gefitinib  dose)  followed  by  a  250  mg  dose  of 
gefitinib,  or  only  a  single  dose  of  250  mg  gefitinib,  under  fasted  conditions.  Ranitidine  is  a  rapid-
acting H2-receptor antagonist that should elevate the gastric pH to a value higher than five for at least 
four hours. Sodium bicarbonate was applied if a pH of ≥ 5 was not achieved. A summary of the results 
for study 0036 are shown in Table 3.

•  Distribution 
In the studies 0031 and 0035, the mean steady-state volume of distribution (given as Vss) for gefitinib 
after  an  iv  dose  was  estimated  to  be  approximately  1600  L  for  healthy  volunteers  and  1400  L  for 
cancer patients. 
In vitro data indicate that gefitinib is a substrate to the P-glycoprotein transporter. 
Distribution in blood:  
There were two studies with oral administration of [14C]-gefitinib (studies 0003, 0719) submitted. The 
concentrations  of  radioactivity  in  blood  were  lower  compared  to  plasma  at  all  times  examined.  The 
ratio of blood to plasma radioactivity was approximately 0.7 in study 0003 and 0.8 in study 0719. This 
indicated  that  a  larger  proportion  of  the  drug-related  radioactivity  was  associated  with  plasma  than 
with the cellular components of the blood.  
Plasma protein binding: 
In study KPJ013, the binding to plasma proteins was found to be approximately 90%. The binding was 
independent of gefitinib concentration and there were no evidence of any gender difference in humans. 
Studies with purified human serum albumin and purified α-1 acid glycoprotein showed that gefitinib 
was bound to both proteins and that α-1 acid glycoprotein binding, appeared to be saturable at higher 
concentrations of gefitinib.  
•  Elimination and Excretion 
Elimination  of  gefitinib  was  evaluated  in  healthy  volunteers  and  cancer  patients  after  an  i.v. 
administration of gefitinib. The mean single-dose terminal half-life in volunteers ranged from 6.5 to 
74.5 h (mean 30.5 h) and in cancer patients from 15.6 to 111 h (mean 41.0 h). 
Single  ascending  oral  doses  of  1,  3,  10,  25,  50  and  75  mg  of  gefitinib  were  administered.  After  24 
hours,  there  was  less  than  0.5  %  of  the  initial  dose  recovered  in  the  urine,  indicating  that  the  renal 
route is not a major route of elimination for gefitinib in humans. 
In  studies  where  [14C]-gefitinib  was  administered  to  healthy  volunteers,  approximately  84  %  of  the 
radioactivity was recovered in urine and faeces over 7 days and 90 % over 10 days. The majority of 
the dose, approximately 81-86 %, was eliminated in the faeces. Urinary excretion accounted for less 
than 4 % of the dose. 
•  Metabolism 
The  metabolism  of  [14C]-gefitinib  was  explored  in  vitro  using  pooled  human  microsomes.  Two 
principal  in  vitro  metabolites  (M537194  and  M387783)  were  formed.  These  metabolites  were  the 
the  propoxymorpholine  ring  and  defluorination  of  the 
products  of  oxidative  cleavage  of 
chlorofluorophenyl ring and it was shown that their formation was mainly catalysed by CYP3A4. In 
total, 17 metabolites of gefitinib were identified from in vitro systems. The major metabolite found in 
human plasma, O-desmethyl gefitinib, M523595, was detected only in minor quantities. 
The  use  of  selective  chemical  inhibitors  and  heterologous  expressed  human  P450  enzymes  showed 
that  the  oxidative  metabolism  of  gefitinib  in  human  hepatic  microsomes  was  catalysed  mainly  by 
CYP3A4.  The  quantitatively  most  important  routes  of  [14C]-gefitinib  metabolism  were  mediated  by 
CYP3A4,  while  CYP3A5  was  a  minor  contributor.  However,  formation  of  M523595,  the  major 
human metabolite, was catalysed almost exclusively by CYP2D6. 
Page 20 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  metabolism  of  gefitinib  in  vivo  was  also  explored.  Gefitinib  accounted  for  up  to  20%  of  the 
plasma  radioactivity  in  healthy  volunteers,  and  although  M523595  accounted  for  some  of  the  other 
80%, there are other components present that were not measured by the metabolite assay. In human, 
the major single metabolite in faeces was M523595, which accounted for 13.7% of the dose. A large 
number of other components (including M387783, M605207, M537194, M605212 and gefitinib), each 
accounting  for  between  1.6-13.2%  of  the  dose,  were  also  detected  in  human  faeces.  Unchanged 
gefitinib accounted for only 3.9% of the dose, indicating that gefitinib was extensively metabolised in 
man. 
In  humans,  the  major  metabolite  M523595  represented  ~12%  of  circulating  radioactivity  between  3 
and 5 h, then rising to around 17% at 8 h onwards.  
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The dose proportionality has been taken into consideration in both single- and multiple dose studies. 
Three single-dose  studies of  gefitinib evaluating  the dose  proportionality  in  healthy  male  volunteers 
were submitted. It was not possible to conclude the dose proportionality in the terms of AUC and Cmax 
for  gefitinib  over  the  range  50  to  500  mg.    The  terminal  half-life  of  gefitinib  appeared  to  be 
independent  of  dose,  although  there  was  a  considerable  variability  between  volunteers. There  was  a 
19.2 fold and a 16.7 fold difference of exposure at the 250 mg and at the 500 mg level, respectively. 
To assess the degree of non-proportionality, pair-wise comparisons of dose-normalised AUC and Cmax 
for each dose level were made. The estimated dose effect on the dose–normalised AUC and Cmax after 
50 and 100 mg, 50 and 250 mg and 100 and 250 mg, appeared to indicate proportionality, since the p-
values were not significant. The opposite was shown by comparisons of the estimated dose effect on 
the dose-normalised AUC  or Cmax after 50, 100 and 250 mg, all compared with 500  mg. All results 
gave significant p-values. The conclusion was that dose proportionality was not shown over the entire 
dose range, and the degree of non-proportionality was highest in the largest administered doses, both 
in cancer patients and healthy volunteers. 
For multiple dose studies, patients received one of six gefitinib doses ranging from 50 mg/day to 700 
mg/day.  AUC(0-24)  following  multiple  dosing  for  14  days.  The  results  show  that  proportionality  was 
observed  up  to  the  recommended  therapeutic  dose.  Non-proportionality  was  observed  for  doses 
exceeding 250-400 mg. 
Time dependency was evaluated in two studies with healthy volunteers and two studies with cancer 
patients. Steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved after 3 to 7 days in healthy volunteers and 
after 6 to 10 days in patients with solid tumours. 
Relationship  between  exposure/concentration  and  efficacy  and  adverse  events  was  not  established. 
However there is a trend with adverse events and increasing dose.  There is no data on decreasing dose 
or halving the dose for patients who have increased toxicity and therefore, it is not known if plasma 
concentrations would still be therapeutic.  
•  Special populations 
No study was conducted to assess the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of gefitinib. 
From analyses of population pharmacokinetic data in cancer patients, no relationships were identified 
between predicted steady state trough concentration and patient age, body weight, gender, ethnicity or 
creatinine clearance (above 20 ml/min).No dose adjustment is required in patients with impaired renal 
function at creatinine clearance >20 ml/min.  Only limited data are available in patients with creatinine 
clearance ≤ 20 ml/min and caution is advised in these patients (see SmPC section 4.2 and 5.2 ).  
Gefitinib has been evaluated in a clinical trial conducted in 41 patients with solid tumours and normal 
hepatic function, or moderate or severe hepatic impairment (classified according to baseline Common 
Toxicity Criteria grades for AST, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubine) due to liver metastases. It was 
shown  that  following  daily  administration  of  250 mg  gefitinib,  time  to  steady  state,  total  plasma 
clearance (CmaxSS)  and  steady-state  exposure (AUC24SS)  were  similar  for  the  groups  with  normal  and 
moderately  impaired  hepatic  function.  Data  from  4  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  due  to 
Page 21 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
liver  metastases  suggested  that  steady-state  exposures  in  these  patients  are  also  similar  to  those  in 
patients with normal hepatic function. 
In a phase I open-label study of single dose gefitinib 250 mg in patients with mild, moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis (according to Child-Pugh classification), there was an increase in 
exposure in  all  groups  compared  with  healthy  controls.  An average  3.1-fold  increase in  exposure to 
gefitinib in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment was observed. None of the patients 
had  cancer,  all  had  cirrhosis  and  some  had  hepatitis.  This  increase  in  exposure  may  be  of  clinical 
relevance  since  adverse  experiences  are  related  to  dose  and  exposure  to  gefitinib.Patients  with 
moderate  to  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child  Pugh  B  or  C)  due to  cirrhosis  have  increased  plasma 
concentrations  of  gefitinib.  These  patients  should  be  closely  monitored  for  adverse  events.    Plasma 
concentrations  were  not  increased  in  patients  with  elevated  aspartate  transaminase  (AST),  alkaline 
phosphatase or bilirubin due to liver metastases (see SmPC section 4.2 and 5.2). 
No dose adjustment is required on the basis of patient age (see SmPC section 4.2 and 5.2). 
There was no evidence of any relevant differences in renal impairment, gender, ethnicity, weight, age 
in the pharmacokinetics of gefitinib. 
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that gefitinib is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.  
Ketoconazole,  an  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4,  markedly  reduced  formation  of  some  of  the  metabolites  of 
gefitinib in vitro. Clinical drug-drug-interaction studies were performed to explore the inhibition and 
induction of CYP3A4 by other drugs and influence on the plasma exposure to gefitinib. In studies in 
healthy volunteers, inhibition of CYP3A4 with itraconazole increased the exposure to gefitinib by 60-
80% while induction of CYP3A4 with rifampicin reduced the exposure to gefitinib by about 80%.  
There  were  no  in  vivo  studies  exploring  the  effect  of  drugs  inhibiting  CYP2D6  on  gefitinib 
pharmacokinetics. However, in subjects with a poor CYP2D6 activity, intake of gefitinib resulted in a 
mean 2-fold higher exposure to the drug compared to extensive CYP2D6 metabolisers, and it would 
be expected that strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine, paroxetine) increased gefitinib exposure to 
the same extent. This increase is considered clinically relevant and has been included in the SmPC. No 
specific dose adjustment is recommended in patients with known CYP2D6 poor metaboliser genotype, 
but these patients should be closely monitored for adverse events (see SmPC section 4.2 and 5.2). 
In  vitro  studies  indicate  that  gefitinib  may  have  the  potential  to  inhibit  CYP2D6.  A  drug-drug 
interaction  study  was  also  performed  to  explore  whether  gefitinib  could inhibit CYP2D6.  A  modest 
inhibition of CYP2D6 by gefitinib, by measuring the metabolism of metoprolol, was found. 
There were no in vivo interaction studies in humans to explore induction of CYP1A and inhibition of 
CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 by gefitinib.  
Pharmacodynamics 
•  Mechanism of action 
No clinical studies have been submitted. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR 
[HER1; ErbB1]) have been identified as key drivers in the process of cell growth and proliferation for 
normal  and  cancer  cells.    EGFR  activating  mutation  within  a  cancer  cell  is  an  important  factor  in 
promotion  of  tumour  cell  growth,  blocking  of  apoptosis,  increasing  the  production  of  angiogenic 
factors and facilitating the processes of metastasis.   
Gefitinib  is  a  selective  small  molecule  inhibitor  of  the  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  tyrosine 
kinase and is an effective treatment for patients with tumours with activating mutations of the EGFR 
tyrosine kinase domain regardless of line of therapy.  No clinically relevant activity has been shown in 
patients with known EGFR mutation-negative tumours.

•  Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No clinical studies exploring the primary pharmacology of gefitinib have been submitted. In studies 
investigating  biomarkers  of  EGF  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  in  skin  biopsies  taken  before  and  on-trial 
changes reflective of EGF receptor inhibition (i.e. activated mitogen-activated protein kinase, p27, Ki 
67, cell cycle Gi arrest, and apoptosis) were present at all dose levels tested. Gefitinib has been shown 
to  inhibit  tyrosine  phosphorylation  by  acting  as  a  competitive  inhibitor  of  ATP.  In  contrast  to  data 
from  tumour  cell-line  and  anti-tumour  activity,  mainly  cytostatic,  has  been  demonstrated  in  a 
conventional,  based  non-clinical  development  programme.  However,  in  clinical  trials,  tumour 
shrinkage was observed in only a small proportion of patients, was in many cases rather dramatic and 
occurred early, median time to response about 4 weeks.  
Clinical efficacy  
This application is  based  on  three  Phase  III  studies  (ISEL,  INTEREST  and  IPASS),  supported  by 3 
additional  studies  (V-15-32,  SIGN  and  ISTANA).  In  addition,  to  the  pivotal  and  supportive  studies 
shown in table 20, the Phase II IDEAL I and IDEAL II studies were submitted as dose-finding studies. 
Furthermore,  a  number  of  other  studies  have  been  submitted  with  gefitinib  in  NSCLC  but  in  other 
patient populations. Data from these studies are included in the evaluation of safety.

•  Dose response study(ies) 
In several phase I studies, including the studies D7913C0005, D7913C00011, D7913C00012 and V-
15-11,  up  to  nine  dose  levels  of  gefitinib  was  tested,  ranging  from  50  mg  to  1000  mg.  MTD  was 
established  at  750  mg  and  1000  mg.  Clear  dose-dependency  was  seen  with  respect  to  tolerability. 
Doses below 600 mg were accompanied by mild and readily reversible side effects, while 600 mg or 
higher doses yielded toxicity leading to treatment interruption and dose reductions. Tumour response 
was seen across a wide range of doses between 150 and 800 mg.  
Two randomised, dose-comparative studies in patients with advanced NSCLC have been performed in 
the  US  (0039,  IDEAL  II)  and  across  Europe,  South  Africa,  Australia  and  Japan  (0016,  IDEAL  I).  
Study 0039 focused on patients previously treated with cisplatin-based regimens and docetaxel. The 
regimen for both studies was 250 mg or 500 mg daily oral dose of gefitinib. 
The  Phase  II  IDEAL  studies,  evaluated the efficacy  and  safety  of the  250  mg  and  500  mg  doses  of 
gefitinib  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  pre-treated  NSCLC.  The  trials  were  similar  in  design 
(multicentre,  double-blind  and  parallel-group)  and  both  recruited  patients  with  relapsed  disease. 
IDEAL  I  was  conducted  primarily  in  Europe  and  Japan  and  IDEAL  II  was  conducted  in  the  US. 
Patients were randomised to receive either 250 mg or 500 mg of gefitinib per day. Objective tumour 
response  was  a  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  both  studies.  IDEAL  II  had  an  additional  primary 
endpoint  of  disease-related  symptom  improvement  rate,  measured  using  LCS,  the  7-symptom  Lung 
Cancer Subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L).The key efficacy 
findings are presented in Table 4. No significant differences between the two dose groups of 250 mg 
and  500 mg  were  evident  for  any  efficacy  endpoints.  These  efficacy  results,  together  with  an 
evaluation of the adverse events associated with the two doses, led to the choice of gefitinib 250 mg as 
the optimum biological effective dose.

Treatments 
For  the  gefitinib  arm,  patients  received  oral  dose  of  250  mg  tablet  once  a  day.  For  the 
carboplatin/paclitaxel  arm,  patients  received  intravenous  (i.v.)  200  mg/m2  paclitaxel  over  3  hours 
followed by i.v. carboplatin AUC 5.0 or 6.0 for 15-60 minutes, every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 
cycles. Dose modifications of carboplatin and paclitaxel for toxicity were allowed. After progression, 
patients  randomised  to  the  gefitinib  treatment  arm  could  receive  carboplatin  /  paclitaxel  for  a 
maximum of 6 cycles. Investigators could decide to treat with another approved therapy if carboplatin 
/  paclitaxel  therapy  was  considered  unsuitable.  Subsequent  treatment  following  discontinuation  of 
carboplatin / paclitaxel in both treatment arms was at the investigator’s discretion. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  gefitinib  with  carboplatin  /  paclitaxel  doublet  chemotherapy 
given as first-line treatment in terms of PFS in selected NSCLC patients (non-inferiority).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy analyses 
Page 25 of 86 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy outcome was PFS, defined as the interval from the date of randomisation to the 
date  of  objective  disease  progression  per  RECIST  criteria,  or  the  date  of  death  from  any  cause. 
Patients were censored for progression at their last evaluable objective tumour assessment only if they 
had neither progressed nor died.  Patients censored at their last evaluable objective tumour assessment 
include those who were lost to follow up or who had withdrawn their consent to continue in the study. 
Progression  information  continued  to  be  collected  for  patients  discontinuing  study  therapy  prior  to 
disease  progression,  irrespective  of  whether  the  patient  subsequently  took  anti-cancer  therapy  after 
study therapy discontinuation. 
Secondary efficacy outcome variables 
The  secondary  efficacy  outcomes  were  OS,  ORR,  QoL  (as  measured  by  FACT-L  and  TOI)  and 
symptom improvement ( as measured by LCS). QOL and symptoms were assessed using the FACT-L 
questionnaire, which comprised 5 domains: 4 that evaluated physical (PWB), social-familial (SWB), 
emotional  (EWB),  and  functional  well-being  (FWB)  and  1  that  evaluated  additional  QOL  aspects 
specifically related to lung cancer (LCS).  
Exploratory efficacy outcome variables 
Tumour samples were analysed to determine biomarker status in the following priority order; 1) EGFR 
mutation status, 2) EGFR gene copy number (FISH status) and 3) EGFR protein expression status. 
Sample size 
The calculation of the number of patients required for this study was based upon the assessment in the 
overall patient population for PFS with a non-inferiority limit HR of 1.2, which translates to up to 1 
month  shortfall  on  gefitinib  if  the  PFS  on  carboplatin  /  paclitaxel  is  6 months.  With  a  recruitment 
period of 20 months and 1212 patients randomised (606 per treatment arm), a follow up period of 6 
months would be sufficient to see 944 progression events (80% power and 5% (2-sided) significance 
level). 
Randomisation 
Randomisation  was stratified  with respect to World Health  Organisation  (WHO)  performance  status 
(PS) (0 or 1 versus 2), smoking history (never versus light ex-smokers), gender and centre. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  analysis  was  performed  by  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  with  covariates  for 
randomised  treatment,  sex,  WHO  performance  status  and  smoking  history.  All  statistical  tests  were 
performed at a 2-sided 5% significance level unless otherwise stated. 
Interim analyses 
There was one interim analysis planned to detect inferiority of gefitinib to carboplatin / paclitaxel for 
PFS. Termination of the study early was considered if PFS for gefitinib was inferior to carboplatin / 
paclitaxel at a 2-sided 10% significance level. That is, if the lower 90% CI for the HR was >1.0. There 
was no adjustment of significance level for the primary analysis of PFS as there was no opportunity in 
the interim analysis to accept the hypothesis of non-inferiority for PFS.

a Main reasons were: serum creatinine greater than 1.5 x upper limit of reference range or creatinine clearance less than or 
equal to 60 mL/min; newly diagnosed CNS metastases that had not yet been definitively treated with surgery and/or 
radiation; ANC less than 2.0 x 109/L, platelets less than 100 x 109/L or haemoglobin less than 10 g/dl. 
b The safety analysis, conducted according to treatment received, was performed on this population. 
c 63 (10.3%) patients that were treated with gefitinib and had disease progression received gefitinib after progression as the 
investigator considered it was providing benefit and 1 (0.2%) patient that was treated with carboplatin / paclitaxel and had 
disease progression continued received carboplatin / paclitaxel after progression as the investigator considered it was 
providing benefit. 
AE=adverse event; DCO=Data cut-off date (14 April 2008); N=Number of patients. 
Recruitment 
A total of 1329 patients were screened for the study and 1217 subsequently randomised.  All patients 
were recruited from 87 centres from several countries in Asia.   
Conduct of the study 
Few  patients  in  either  treatment  group  had  major  deviations:  12  (2%)  in  the  gefitinib  arm  and  28 
(4.6%)  in  the  carboplatin  /  paclitaxel  arm.  Protocol  deviations  were  generally  balanced  between 
treatment  groups  with  the  exception  of  the  number  of  patients  that  failed  to  receive  randomised 
treatment:  19  patients in the  carboplatin  / paclitaxel  group compared  with 2  patients  in  the  gefitinib 
group (reason for treatment discontinuation was ‘subject not willing to continue treatment), 
Treatment compliance 
Patients  self-administered  gefitinib  and  compliance  was  assessed  by  tablet  count.    Treatment 
compliance  with  gefitinib  was  high  (98.3%).  Carboplatin  and  paclitaxel  administration  were 
documented.  The  mean  (median)  dose  intensity  of  chemotherapy  (total  carboplatin  /  paclitaxel 
received per week divided by that planned) was 92% (96%) for both carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
Concomitant medication 
More gefitinib-treated patients received different types of topical corticosteroids to mainly treat skin 
toxicity  events.  Carboplatin  /  paclitaxel  patients  received  premedication  with  dexamethasone, 
diphenhydramine,  H2-blockers,  and  5-HT3  antagonists.    In  addition,  patients  received  propulsives, 
colony  stimulating  factors,  benzodiazepine  derivates,  antihistamines  such  as  chlorphenamine  and 
contact  laxatives,  which  were  more  commonly  given  to  patients  in  the  carboplatin/paclitaxel.  
Concomitant medications reflected toxicity management, which were consistent with the safety profile 
of all drugs.

Exploratory biomarkers 
683  patients  out  of  the  1217  patients  randomised  in  the  study  provided  a  sample  for  exploratory 
biomarker  analysis.    The  total  number  of  patients  with  evaluable  data  was  437  (36%)  for  EGFR 
mutation analyses, 365 (30%) for EGFR protein expression analyses and 406 (33%) for EGFR FISH 
status analyses. There were 60% (261/437) of patients that were positive for EGFR  mutation status, 
61% (249/406) for EGFR FISH status and 73% (266/365) for EGFR protein expression status. 
The PFS results from analysis of patients with EGFR mutation status are shown in Table 9 and Figure 
4.  The  results  show  that  PFS  was  significantly  longer  with  gefitinib  than  carboplatin  /  paclitaxel 
treatment in patients who were EGFR mutation positive (HR 0.48; 95%CI 0.36-0.64; p<0.0001) while 
PFS  was  significantly  shorter  with  gefitinib  than  carboplatin  /  paclitaxel  treatment  in  patients  who 
were  EGFR  mutation  negative  (HR  2.85;  95%CI  2.05-3.98;  p<0.0001).    Results  in  the  mutation 
unknown group (HR 0.68; 95%CI 0.58-0.81; p<0.0001) were similar to that for the ITT population. 
The ORR results by EGFR  mutation status were consistent with the PFS results by EGFR  mutation 
status.

Comparison in OS between the gefitinib and carboplatin/paclitaxel 
treatment arms based on the EGFR mutation status – IPASS study 
A relationship between EGFR FISH status and PFS was observed where PFS was significantly longer 
with gefitinib than carboplatin / paclitaxel treatment in patients who had FISH positive tumours (HR 
0.66;  95%CI  0.50-0.88;  p=0.0050).    In  contrast,  in  FISH  negative  tumours  PFS  was  numerically 
shorter  with  gefitinib  than  carboplatin  /  paclitaxel  treatment  in  patients  although  this  was  not 
statistically significant (HR 1.24; 95%CI 0.87-1.76; p=0.2368).  A post-hoc analysis was performed to 
investigate whether the effect in PFS in the patients with EGFR FISH positive tumours was related to 
EGFR mutation status. Of the 245 patients with EGFR FISH positive tumours whose EGFR mutation 
status was also known, 190 patients also had a positive EGFR mutation status. The results from this 
post-hoc analysis showed that PFS was significantly longer with gefitinib than carboplatin / paclitaxel 
treatment in patients who had EGFR FISH positive and EGFR mutation positive tumours (HR 0.48, 
95% CI 0.34 to 0.67) but was significantly shorter in patients who had EGFR FISH positive tumours 
with no EGFR mutation detected (HR 3.85, 95% CI 2.09 to 7.09). This result suggests that the PFS 
Page 33 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
benefit seen in the subgroup of patients with FISH positive tumours may be driven by the overlap with 
positive mutation status. The ORR results by EGFR FISH status were consistent with the PFS results 
by EGFR FISH status. There was no evidence that EGFR protein expression status influenced PFS or 
ORR outcomes. 
QoL and disease-related symptoms 
Quality of life outcomes differed according to EGFR mutation status. In a post-hoc analysis in EGFR 
mutation-positive patients, significantly more IRESSA-treated patients experienced an improvement in 
quality of life and lung cancer symptoms vs carboplatin/paclitaxel. QoL data are shown in Table 11.

The times to worsening in QoL and disease-related symptoms were longer in the gefitinib arm (7.1 to 
9.7 months) compared with the carboplatin / paclitaxel arm (2.5 to 3.1 months).    
In  patients  with  EGFR  mutation  positive  status,  improvement  rates  for  QoL  and  in  lung  cancer 
symptoms favoured gefitinib compared with carboplatin / paclitaxel.  In patients with EGFR mutation 
negative  status  by  contrast,  improvement  rates  for  QoL  and  in  lung  cancer  symptoms  favoured 
carboplatin / paclitaxel compared with gefitinib.  
The time to worsening in QoL and disease-related symptoms were longer in the gefitinib arm (11.3 to 
16.6  months)  compared  with  the  carboplatin  /  paclitaxel  arm  (2.9  to  3.0  months)  in  patients  with 
EGFR mutation positive status.  In contrast, in patients with EGFR mutation negative status, time to 
worsening  in  QoL  and  disease-related  symptoms  were  similar  or  shorter  in  the  gefitinib  arm  (1.4 
months) compared with the carboplatin / paclitaxel arm (1.4 to 4.2 months).

Treatments 
Gefitinib was given as a 250 mg tablet on a 4-cycle supply (3 months). On Day 1 of the first cycle, 
gefitinib  was  administered  during  the  clinic  visit.  Subsequently,  gefitinib  therapy  was  taken  once 
daily,  at  about  the  same  time.  Treatment  could  be  taken  with  or  without  food.  Patients  receiving 
gefitinib were to maintain visits according to the 21-day schedule  
Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 was administered intravenously over 1 hour, every 3 weeks (1 cycle equalled 21 
days). If excessive toxicity or side effects were observed at this dose, patients were recommended to 
undergo a dose reduction to 60 mg/m2 for subsequent cycles. Docetaxel doses were calculated using 
the  patient’s  actual  height  and  weight  to  determine  the  patient’s  body  surface  area  (BSA)  using  the 
DuBois and DuBois formula: BSA = 0.007184 x weight (kg) 0.425 x height (cm) 0.725.  
Patients  continued  to  receive  treatment  with  either  gefitinib  or  docetaxel  until  disease  progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, severe non-compliance, patient lost to follow-up and death.  
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective was to compare overall survival for gefitinib and docetaxel, using the following 
pre-defined co-primary analyses: 
(cid:131) An  assessment  of  non-inferiority  in  the  overall  per  protocol  (PP)  population,  and  if  accepted,  an 
assessment of superiority in the overall intention to treat (ITT) population  
(cid:131) An assessment of superiority in the ITT EGFR FISH+ population 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  OS  as  measured  from  the  date  of  randomisation  to  the  date  of 
patient death due to any cause, or to the last date the patient was known to be alive.  
Secondary endpoint 
The secondary efficacy endpoint were PFS, ORR and PRO. PFS was defined as the interval from the 
date of randomisation to the date of objective disease progression (per RECIST criteria) or death from 
any cause. Patients who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis were censored at the time of 
their last full adequate objective tumour assessment. This included patients lost to follow-up or who 
had  withdrawn  consent.  PFS  for  patients  without  post-baseline  tumour  assessment  was  censored  at 
zero  days.  For  patients  who  died  in  the  absence  of  objective  progression  more  than  12  weeks  after 
their  last  RECIST  assessment,  PFS  was  censored  at  the  time  of  their  last  RECIST  assessment.  For 
patients  who  had  objective  progression  more  than  12  weeks  after  the  previous RECIST  assessment, 
PFS was censored at the time of last RECIST assessment immediately prior to the gap of 12 weeks or 
more. PFS analyses were conducted in the overall EFR population and the EFR population of patients 
found to be EGFR FISH+.  
For  PRO  outcomes,  the  overall  improvement  was  measured  in  patient-reported  functionality 
(measured  by  TOI),  quality  of  life  (measured  by  total  FACT-L)  and  disease-related  symptoms 
(measured by LCS) questionnaires. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints 
The  exploratory  efficacy  endpoints  included  biomarker  analysis  of  EGFR  FISH,  EGFR  mutation 
tissue  samples  for 
status,  EGFR  protein  expression  and  K-Ras  mutation  status.  Tumour 
EGFR/biomarker  analysis  were  taken  at  baseline.  Urine  and  plasma  samples  for  biomarker  analysis 
were taken at baseline and at day 43 (visit 4).  
Sample size 
The calculation for the number of patients required for this study was based upon the assessment in the 
overall  PP  patient  population  of  overall  survival  for  non-inferiority,  to  be  interpreted  using  95%

confidence intervals. Based on the TAX-317 study4, the median overall survival was 7.5 months for 
docetaxel  75  mg/m2  and  4.6  months  for  BSC.  There  were  approximately  45  and  77  deaths  in  the 
docetaxel and BSC arms, respectively. From these data, the estimated log hazard ratio (active-control 
effect size) for docetaxel to BSC was approximately 0.49 (-log [4.6/7.5]) with a standard error of 0.18 
(2 / sqrt [45 + 77]).  
The null hypothesis to be tested was that gefitinib 250 mg would retain less than 50% of the active-
control effect on survival. The relative difference between the treatment arms would be analyzed by 
estimating  a  hazard  ratio  (gefitinib  to  docetaxel)  and  its  95%  CI  from  an  unadjusted  proportional 
hazards model in the PP population. The null hypothesis was to be rejected if the upper 95% CI limit 
for the log HR was less than k, where k is a constant derived using the methodology of Rothmann et 
al5 (dependent on the number of observed events and alpha used, the active-control effect size and its 
standard error).  
If the null hypothesis of survival inferiority was rejected, then superior survival for gefitinib was to be 
declared  relative  to  docetaxel  if  the  upper  2-sided  95%  CL  was  below  1.0  (estimated  in  the  ITT 
population)6.  
The sample size goal was to have at least 85% power to reject the survival inferiority null hypothesis 
at a 2-sided 5% significance level versus the alternative hypothesis that the HR is 0.975. This required 
about 1150 observed deaths. Approximately 1440 patients were to be randomized. 
Randomisation 
Patients  had  to  begin  study  therapy  within  72 hours  of  the  date  of  randomisation.  Patients  were 
randomised  on  a  1:1  basis  using  dynamic  balancing7  with  respect

to 
Blinding (masking) 
The  study  had  an  open-label  design  due  to  differences  in  the  method  of  administration  of  the  two 
treatment regimens.  
Statistical methods 
There were two co-primary analyses performed by unadjusted proportional hazards model: 1) test of 
non-inferiority in the overall PP patient population and, if accepted, a test of superiority for gefitinib 
over docetaxel in the overall ITT population 2) test of superiority for gefitinib over docetaxel in EGFR 
FISH+  patients  from  the  ITT  population.  Subgroup  analyses  based  on  stratification  factors  derived 
from  the  final  clinical  database  were  also  conducted  comparing  overall  survival  in  the  following 
subgroups  of  (1)  the  overall  PP  population,  and  (2)  the  EGFR  FISH+  ITT  population:  1)  histology 
(adenocarcinoma;  other),  2)  performance  status  (0,1;  2),  3)  prior  platinum  therapy  (refractory;

up). All subsequent chemotherapy, radiation, surgical or other anticancer therapy during the time until 
death was recorded. 
Primary efficacy analyses 
The  tests  of  non-inferiority  in  the  overall  population  and  of  superiority  in  the  EGFR  FISH+  patient 
population  were  considered  to  be  co-primary  analyses.  To  preserve  the  overall  type  I  error  rate,  a 
modified Hochberg procedure was employed where 1% of the overall 5% type I error rate was to be 
spent  on  the  test  of  superiority  in  EGFR  FISH+  patients.  Other  than  for  the  co-primary  analyses  of 
overall survival, all statistical tests were performed with a two-sided 5% significance level. Both co-
primary analyses were performed with an unadjusted proportional hazards model and the results were 
presented in terms of hazard ratio, confidence interval and p-value. 
Applying  the  Hochberg  methodology  in  the  calculation  of  the  non-inferiority  margin  led  to  the 
following  procedure  for  the  co-primary  analyses:  If  superiority  in  EGFR  FISH+  patients  in  the  ITT 
population was demonstrated, the null hypothesis of inferiority was to be rejected if the upper limit of 
the 95%  CI  for the  HR  in the  PP  population  was lower than  1.1598.  If  superiority  in  EGFR  FISH+ 
patients was not demonstrated, the null hypothesis of inferiority was to be rejected if the upper limit of 
the  96%  CI  for  the  HR  was  lower  than  1.1545.  If  non-inferiority  was  concluded,  superiority  of 
gefitinib  over  docetaxel  would  be  declared  if  the  upper  limit  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  HR  in  the  ITT 
population was below 1.0. 
Further supportive analyses were conducted comparing overall survival in several subgroups. A global 
interaction  test  was  performed  to  test  the  overall  strength  of  evidence  for  consistency  over  all 
subgroups. Covariate by treatment interactions were also assessed individually. 
Secondary efficacy outcome variables 
Progression  free  survival  (PFS)  was  analysed  in  the  “evaluable  for  response”  population  using  an 
adjusted proportional hazards model. Objective tumour response and QoL and symptom improvement 
was  analysed  by  multiple  logistic  regression  models.  Time  to  worsening  was  analysed  by  a 
proportional hazards model. 
Interim analyses 
One  pre-planned  interim  analysis  for  overall  survival  was  conducted  following  346  deaths.  The 
purpose  of  this  analysis  was  to  detect  inferiority  relating  to  overall  survival  for  gefitinib  relative  to 
docetaxel.  No  alpha-adjustment  for  the  type  I  (false  positive)  error  rate  was  applied  to  the  final 
analysis  since  there  was  no  opportunity  at  the  interim  analysis  to  accept  the  hypothesis  of  non-
inferiority for overall survival. 
RESULTS

Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled 01 March 2004 and the last patient was enrolled 17 February 2006. The 
data cut-off date was 06 March 2007. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was dated 17 October 2003. There were four amendments to the study protocol, 
all  of  which  were  made  after  the  start  of  patient  recruitment.  One  amendment  introduced  the  co-
primary analyses in the subgroup of EGFR FISH+ patients and included amendments to the statistical 
considerations  to  ensure  the  overall  type-I  error  was  not  inflated  by  having  these  two  co-primary 
analyses. The majority of other changes were clarifications and are expected to have had no impact for 
the primary endpoint. 
Treatment compliance 
A  very  small  proportion  of  patients  discontinued  study  treatment  permanently  due  to  severe  non-
compliance (0.3% and 0.4% in the gefitinib and docetaxel groups, respectively). Overall, 82.2% of all 
docetaxel  cycles  were  given  at  full  dose.  A  total  of  289  patients  (20.0%)  had  interruptions  to  their 
gefitinib or docetaxel therapy; these interruptions were generally of short duration. 
Concomitant medication 
In gefitinib-treated patients, anti-infective treatments used more frequently to manage skin toxicities, 
while  for  docetaxel-treated  patients,  there  were  more  antihistamines,  corticosteroids,  5-HT3 
antagonists,  H2-blockers,  G-CSFs,  erythropoietin,  propulsives,  blood  and  related  products  that  were 
used.

Baseline data 
Disease characteristics and history at entry: ITT population 
The  patient  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  are  shown  in  Table  13  and  disease 
characteristics  are  shown  in  Table  14.  For  previous  cancer  treatments,  1229  patients  (83.8%)  had 
received  at  least  one  previous  chemotherapy  regimen  and  31.0%  of  patients  had  experienced  a  best 
response of PD/unknown to their last chemotherapy. All patients in the overall study population had 
received a platinum compound, with 18.5% of all patients also receiving paclitaxel at some stage in 
their treatment.

Numbers analysed 
This study included six populations: intention-to-treat (ITT), evaluable-for-safety (EFS), per-protocol, 
evaluable-for-response  (EFR),  evaluable-for-pulmonary-symptom-improvement,  and  evaluable-for-
QOL. In addition, the co-primary EGFR FISH+ population was evaluated throughout.

Of the 1466 patients randomised, 150 (10.2%) were excluded from the EFR population due to protocol 
deviation  or  non-measurable  disease  at  baseline.  Therefore,  the  EFR  population  consisted  of  1316 
patients.  
Of the 1466 patients randomised, 500 (34.1%) were excluded from the EFQ population. Therefore, a 
total  of  966  patients  were  included  in  the  QoL  analyses.  Technical  problems  with  the  use  of  the 
electronic  diary  for  collection  of  the  QoL  data  accounted  for  the  proportion  of  missing  data  being 
somewhat higher than some other gefitinib studies.  
Outcomes and estimation 
The  randomised  phase  III  INTEREST  study  was  conducted  in  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  NSCLC  who  had  previously  received  platinum-based  chemotherapy.    The  analyses  of 
overall  survival  were  based  on  a  data  cut-off  of  06  March  2007,  by  which  time  1169  deaths  had 
occurred  in  the  primary  PP  population  (Table  16  and  Figure  6).  In  the  PP  population,  the  median 
overall  survival  was  7.6  months  for  gefitinib  treated  patients  and  8.0  months  for  docetaxel  treated 
patients (HR 1.020; 96% CI 0.905-1.150) (Table 15). The CI for the HR fell below the non-inferiority 
limit of 1.154. When adjusting the PP analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model, with covariate 
adjustment  for  histology  (adenocarcinoma  versus  other),  performance  status  (0  or  1  versus  2),  prior 
platinum  therapy  (refractory  versus  received),  smoking  history  (ever  versus  never),  prior  paclitaxel 
therapy  (refractory  versus  received  versus  none),  prior  regimens  (1  versus  2),  sex,  and  racial  origin 
(Asian versus other), the HR was 1.044; 96% CI 0.925-1.178.  
In  the  EGFR  FISH+  population the  median  overall  survival  was  8.4  versus  7.5  months  for  gefitinib 
and docetaxel treated patients, respectively (HR 1.087; 95%CI 0.782-1.510; p=0.6199). No association 
between EGFR FISH status and survival outcome was observed.

There was no statistically significant difference in terms of PFS between gefitinib and docetaxel in the 
EFR population (HR 1.04; 95%CI 0.93-1.18; p=0.4658) (Table 17 and Figure 7).

Hazard ratios for PFS <1.00 indicate treatment with gefitinib 250 mg was associated with a more favourable outcome 
compared with docetaxel 75 mg/m2. 
Progression-free survival was calculated by AstraZeneca from target lesion measurements recorded by the investigator, 
the investigator’s assessment of non-target lesions and new lesions, and/or the date of patient death. 
Adjusted models included terms for sex (male versus female), histology (adenocarcinoma versus other), performance 
status (0 or 1 versus 2), smoking history (ever versus never), prior chemotherapy regimens ( 1 versus 2), prior platinum 
therapy (refractory versus received), prior paclitaxel therapy (refractory versus received versus none) and racial origin 
(Asian versus other).

subgroups. 
Subgroup analyses for the non Asian population 
As  the  INTEREST trial  had  a  high  number  of  Asian patients,  a subgroup  analysis  for  OS,  PFS  and 
ORR  was  performed  in  the  non-Asian  population  only,  based  on  clinical  characteristics  on  EGFR 
mutation, smoking and histology status. The results are presented in Figure 8.  In the EGFR M+ status 
patients, no differences in OS were observed but, notably, the ORR were 42.9% and 20% for gefitinib 
and docetaxel, respectively, and PFS was in favour of gefitinib.

Exploratory analysis results for PFS and OS according to smoking status and histology. 
An  exploratory  analysis  for  the  interaction  between  smoking  and  PFS  was  presented  (Table  18  and 
Table  19).  The  results  showed  a  statistically  significant  interaction  between  treatment  and  smoking 
status  for  PFS,  with  never  smokers  achieving  longer  progression-free  survival  with  gefitinib. 
However, there was no interaction found for OS.

with the following terms: randomised treatment, histology, smoking history, prior platinum therapy, prior paclitaxel therapy, 
number of prior chemotherapy regimens, WHO performance status, sex, race, age, time from diagnosis to randomisation and 
best response to prior chemotherapy. This basic model was defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for evaluation of 
the overall survival interactions. The same model was fitted for PFS. 
b The Cox proportional hazards model additionally fitted a term for treatment-by-histology to the basic model to compare to 
the basic model alone. 
c Overall survival with censoring at the time of any additional first new post-discontinuation therapy. 
d  The  Cox  proportional hazards model  additionally  fitted  a  term  for  treatment-by-smoking  history  to  compare  to  the  basic

e  The  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  additionally  fitted  the  following  terms  to  the  basic  model:  treatmentby-histology, 
treatment-by-smoking  history,  histology-by-smoking  history,  and  treatment-by-histology-bysmoking  history.  This  was 
compared to the same model excluding the treatment-by-histology-by smoking history interaction. 
In EGFR FISH+ patients, there was no difference observed between gefitinib and docetaxel in terms 
of  PFS (HR  0.84,  95%  CI  0.59 to 1.19, p=0.3343). However,  gefitinib-treated patients  had a  higher 
response rate than docetaxel in terms of ORR (13.0% vs 7.4%, p=0.0387). There was no evidence of a 
difference between gefitinib and docetaxel in terms of these clinical outcomes for patients with EGFR 
FISH-negative tumours. 
Page 46 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
In both treatment groups approximately 47% of patients received subsequent anti-cancer therapies that 
differed from randomised therapy post-discontinuation. Of the gefitinib-treated patients, 31% received 
docetaxel  post-discontinuation  and  of  docetaxel-treated  patients  37%  received  subsequent  EGFR 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy (15% gefitinib, 21% erlotinib). 
Exploratory biomarker results for EGFR mutation status 
The  key  demographic  characteristics  for  patients  with  evaluable  tissue  samples  for  biomarker 
exploratory analyses were generally comparable to the demographics for the overall study population, 
with slightly fewer samples available from patients of Asian racial origin. In particular, only 1.8% of 
patients that were evaluable for K-Ras mutation status were Asian, primarily due to unavailability of 
the assay in China. Characteristics of patients with high EGFR gene copy number and EGFR-positive 
tumours  were  similar  to  the  overall  study  population.  Patients  with  EGFR  mutations  tended  to  be 
female,  never-smokers,  of  Asian  racial  origin,  and  have  adenocarcinoma  histology.  They  also 
appeared  less  likely  to  have  responded  to  their  last  chemotherapy.  There  were  a  high  proportion  of 
Asian  patients  with  EGFR  mutations  as  compared  to  Caucasian  population.  In  contrast,  there  was  a 
higher  rate  of  EGFR  FISH+  patients  in  Caucasian  patients  compared  to  Asian  patients  (Table  20). 
There was a tendency for patients with K-Ras mutations to have adenocarcinoma histology and to be 
smokers. The majority of patients positive for one EGFR biomarker were also positive for the other 
EGFR biomarkers as overlapping for more than one biomarker was high.

prior  regimens  (1  versus  2),  sex,  and  racial  origin  (Asian  versus  other)  for  PFS;  hazard  ratios  <1.00  indicate  that 
treatment  with  gefitinib  250  mg  is  associated  with  a  longer  survival/PFS time  than  docetaxel  75 mg/m2.    Odds  ratio 
derived from Logistic regression model with the same covariates as for PFS; odds ratios >1.00 indicate a greater chance 
of response with gefitinib 250 mg.

No  relationship  between  K-Ras  mutation  status  and  relative  survival  outcome,  PFS  or  ORR  was 
observed in both treatments. The ORR was low in  patients with mutated K-Ras in both study arms. 
The presence of mutated K-Ras and EGFR were in essence mutually exclusive. 
Overall survival, PFS and ORR were similar for gefitinib and docetaxel irrespective of EGFR protein 
expression  status,  No relationship  between  EGFR  protein  expression status  and survival  outcome  in 
the  two  treatment  groups  was  found  (EGFR  protein  expression  status-by-treatment  interaction, 
p=0.8713). 
Disease-related symptoms and Quality of life (QoL) 
The QoL was measured whilst the patient was receiving randomised treatment. Overall compliance for 
completion  of  the  FACT-L  questionnaire  was  more  than  75%  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  results 
from the LCS test showed that gefitinib was similar to docetaxel in terms of disease-related symptoms 
(improvement  rates  20%  versus  17%,  p=0.1329)  while  significantly  more  gefitinib-treated  patients 
experienced  clinically  relevant  improvements  in  QoL  compared  with  docetaxel  (TOI  improvement 
rates 17% versus 10%, p=0.0026, FACT-L 25% versus 15%, p<0.0001) (Table 22).

Supportive  Care  versus  Placebo  plus  Best  Supportive  Care  in  Patients  With  Advanced  NSCLC  who 
Have Received One or Two Prior Chemotherapy Regimens and are Refractory or Intolerant to Their 
Most Recent Regimen  
METHODS 
Study Participants  
This study aimed to recruit patients who had received either 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for 
treatment of NSCLC who were refractory or intolerant to their most recent regimen. For patients aged 
<70  years  at  initial  diagnosis,  at  least  1  prior  therapy  should  have  included  platinum-based 
chemotherapy;  however, elderly  patients (≥70  years  of  age  at  initial  diagnosis) were  not required to 
have received prior platinum therapy and may have received 1 or 2 prior non-platinum or single agent 
regimens.  The  key  inclusion  criteria  were:  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  that  was  not 
amenable  to  curative  surgery  or  radiotherapy;  refractory  or  intolerant  to  most  recent  chemotherapy 
regimen;  performance  status  (PS)  of  0,  1,  or  2  (patients  of  PS  3  were  also  eligible  unless  the 
investigator  believed  the  poor  PS  was  predominantly  due  to  co-existing  morbidity,  e.g.,  previous 
cerebrovascular  accident,  debilitating  rheumatoid  arthritis  or  severe  cardiac  impairment);  life 
expectancy  of  at  least  8  weeks.  This  study  was  conducted  in  centres  from  different  countries 
worldwide. 
Treatments 
The gefitinib dose level for this study was 250 mg with matching placebo tablets. Gefitinib or placebo 
was dispensed to patients in a double-blind manner on Day 1, and as required thereafter. Gefitinib or 
placebo treatment was taken once daily. It could be taken with or without food. If the patient forgot to 
take a dose (or had emesis within 30 minutes of taking that dose), they took the last missed dose as 
soon as they remembered, as long as it was at least 12 hours before the next dose was due. Patients 
continued to take gefitinib or placebo until they were no longer considered by the investigator to be 
deriving  clinical  benefit,  the  treatment  was  stopped  due  to  toxicity,  consent  was  withdrawn,  or 
gefitinib or placebo was discontinued for other reasons. 
Objectives 
Page 49 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  overall  survival  for  gefitinib  plus  BSC  versus  placebo  plus 
BSC. The secondary objectives were to compare gefitinib plus BSC versus placebo plus BSC in terms 
of  time  to  treatment  failure,  investigator  assessed  overall  objective  tumour  response  (complete 
response [CR] +partial response [PR]), quality of life changes, and tolerability. The study also aimed 
to  investigate  the  correlation  of  EGFR  and  other  related  biomarker  status  with  efficacy  in  those 
patients where such tumour material was available. The statistical hypothesis was made on the basis of 
increased response rates and their durability observed in an uncontrolled Phase II setting, and the study 
design was based on the primary hypothesis that therapy with gefitinib would result in a statistically 
significant improvement in survival for patients with adenocarcinoma histology. It was hypothesised 
that  gefitinib  would  reduce  the  hazard rate  by  25% relative  to  the  placebo  arm  among  patients  with 
adenocarcinoma. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Overall survival was the primary variable and was used as the basis for the sample size calculation. 
Overall survival was assessed from the date of randomisation to the date of patient death, due to any 
cause, or to the last date the patient was known to be alive (intention to treat population). 
Time  to  treatment  failure  defined  from  the  date  of  randomisation  to  the  date  at  which  the  patient 
discontinued  from  study  therapy  or  the  last  on-study  therapy  visit  for  patients  still  receiving  study 
therapy prior to data cut-off (intention to treat population). Objective tumour response determined by 
the investigator at discontinuation of study therapy or the last visit prior to data cut-off (evaluable for 
response  and  intention  to treat  population).  RECIST  criteria  were  used  by  the  investigator  to  assess 
objective tumour response. The overall best confirmed response rate was calculated as the percentage 
of evaluable patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). 
In patients where tumour tissue samples were available (paraffin embedded tissue block or sections cut 
from  the  tissue  blocks),  analyses  of  EGFR  were  undertaken.  This  included  assessing  total  and 
phosphorylated  EGFR  protein  expression,  EGFR  tyrosine  kinase  mutation  status,  EGFR  gene  copy 
number  and  receptor  dimerisation  patterns  associated  with  EGFR  and  other  HER  family  members 
(ErbB2 and ErbB3). Related signal transduction, proliferation and apoptosis markers were also to be 
performed at a central laboratory. Provision of a biopsy sample was not mandatory for inclusion in the 
study. 
The quality of life outcome variables of this study were based on the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-Lung [FACT-L] (evaluable for QOL population), and included mean change from baseline, 
best overall response, time to improvement, duration of improvement and time to worsening derived 
for  each  score.  The  FACT-L  questionnaire  comprised  5  domains,  4  that  evaluated  physical,  social-
familial,  emotional,  and  functional  well-being  and  one  that  evaluated  additional  QOL  aspects 
specifically  related  to  lung  cancer.  Each  domain  consisted  of  up  to  10  QOL  statements.  For  each 
statement, patients indicated the extent to which the statement was true, using the following 5-point 
Likert scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). 
Sample size 
The study  design  was  based  on  the  primary  hypothesis  that therapy  with  gefitinib  would result in a 
statistically  significant  improvement  in  survival  for  patients  with  adenocarcinoma  histology.  It  was 
hypothesised  that  gefitinib  would reduce the  hazard rate  by  25%  relative to the  placebo  arm  among 
patients  with  adenocarcinoma.  The  sample  size  estimation  assumed  a  2:1  randomisation 
(gefitinib:placebo), uniform accrual over 12 months, and a minimum follow-up of 9 months. 
It was anticipated that approximately 15% of patients would crossover from placebo to gefitinib after 
progression.  Using  the  methodology  of  Porcher  et  al  (2002)8  to  account  for  crossover,  the  final 
analysis required a minimum of 696 events to achieve 90% power for a 2-sided 5% significance level 
test. Assuming exponential survival, if the 1-year survival rate for the placebo arm was 20%, a total of 
866  patients  with  adenocarcinoma  (577:289)  were  to  be  randomised.  It  was  estimated  that  66%  of 
patients screened would have adenocarcinoma. It was therefore estimated that to obtain 866 patients 
with  adenocarcinoma,  approximately  1299  (866:433)  patients  would  be  randomised  altogether. 
However,  the  initial  protocol  rationale  for  focusing  on  the  adenocarcinoma  subset  of  patients  was

questioned once data from the BR-21 study emerged suggesting that tumour response alone does not 
explain the increase in survival (Shepherd et al 2004). Assuming gefitinib 250 mg is as efficacious as 
erlotinib in terms of survival, and with up to 1800 patients entered, the current study would have been 
overpowered. Following patients through to mid-2005 as per the study protocol (see Appendix 12.1.1) 
would  have  resulted  in  a  test  with  over  99%  power.  It  was  therefore  calculated  that  the  efficacy  of 
gefitinib 250 mg could be assessed with reasonable power sooner than was anticipated in the protocol, 
thus  minimising  the  time  patients  were  exposed  to  trial  procedures  and  randomised  treatment.  By 
assuming up to a 3-month delay in the separation of Kaplan-Meier curves as observed in the BR-21 
study and that gefitinib 250 mg is associated with an underlying improvement in survival equal to that 
associated with erlotinib, it was calculated that 900 deaths would provide at least 86% power to detect 
this magnitude of effect at the 2.5% 1-sided significance level. 
Randomisation 
to 
treatment  given 
individual  patients  was  determined  by 
the  Centralised 
The  actual 
Registration/Randomisation  Centre,  using  a  minimisation  method9.  Patients  were  categorised  at 
randomisation with respect to tumour histology (adenocarcinoma versus other), gender (male versus 
female),  smoking  history  (never  smoked  versus  current/former  smoker),  reason  for  prior 
chemotherapy failure (refractory versus intolerant), and centre. Centre was used as a balancing factor 
but had less weighting than the 4 stratification factors. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study medication was supplied as round, brown film-coated tablets with a matching placebo. The 
active and placebo tablets were identical and presented in the same packaging to ensure blinding of the 
medication. The label attached to each bottle of study material had a unique material pack code that 
was linked to the randomisation scheme. The Centralised Registration/Randomisation Centre assigned 
the bottle of study material to be dispensed to each patient. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  analysis  compared  overall  survival  of  gefitinib  250  mg  to  placebo.  This  analysis  was 
performed on the ITT population. The treatment arms were compared with a log-rank test stratified for 
the following factors: 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
histology (adenocarcinoma versus other) 
gender (male versus female) 
smoking history (never smoked versus current/former smoker) 
reason for prior chemotherapy failure (refractory versus intolerant)

Recruitment 
A total of 1836 patients were screened for the study and 1692 patients were randomised to treatment 
(1129  patients  to  receive  gefitinib  250  mg  and  563  patients  to receive  placebo);  these  patients  were 
recruited  from  210  centres  in  28  countries  and  included  812  patients  (48.0%)  with  adenocarcinoma 
histology.  Patients  were  recruited  from  210  centres  in  28  countries  (Argentina,  Australia,  Brazil, 
Bulgaria,  Canada,  Estonia,  Germany,  Greece,  Hungary,  India,  Ireland,  Latvia,  Lithuania,  Malaysia, 
Mexico,  Netherlands,  Norway,  Philippines,  Poland,  Romania,  Russia,  Singapore,  Slovakia,  Sweden, 
Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and United Kingdom). The first patient was enrolled on 15 July 2003, and 
the last patient was enrolled on 2 August 2004.

There  were  2  amendments  to  the  study  protocol.  The  first  amended  the  stratification  of  patients  to 
include tumour histology (adenocarcinoma versus other) and gender (male versus female), while race 
(Asian versus other) and prior number of chemotherapy regimens (1 versus 2) were removed. 
In  addition,  histology  (adenocarcinoma  versus  other)  was  included  as  a  stratification  factor  in  the 
secondary analysis. 
The  second  amendment  occurred  after  data  from  the  BR-21  study  of  erlotinib  versus  placebo  in 
patients with recurrent NSCLC who had failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen (Shepherd et 
al 2004) showed a significant survival advantage for erlotinib that was independent of histology. In the 
light of these data, the IDMC recommended that the overall population be included as a co-primary 
population alongside the adenocarcinoma population, and that an interim analysis should be conducted 
at the close of recruitment and the final analysis should be performed once 900 deaths had accrued in 
the overall population. 
For the interim analysis of overall survival, an extreme p-value was applied (p<0.001) to ensure the 
trial was only unblinded in the event of a highly convincing result and to preserve the overall type-I 
error at 5% in the final analysis.

Outcomes and estimation 
The  randomised  phase  III  ISEL  study,  was  conducted  in  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  who  had 
received  1  or  2  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  and  were  refractory  or  intolerant  to  their  most  recent 
regimen. The analyses was based on a data cut-off of 29 October 2004, by which time 976 deaths had 
accrued,  median  follow-up  was  7.2  months.  No  statistically  significant  difference  for  the  primary 
Page 56 of 86 
 
 
 
 
stratified  log-rank  test  was  observed.  For  the  overall  population  the  HR  was  0.89,  (95%  CI  0.77  to 
1.02, p=0.0871. A hazard ratio < 1 implies a lower risk of death on gefitinib).

Secondary endpoints: 
For  the  adenocarcinoma  population  the  HR  for  overall  survival  was  0.84,  (95%  CI  0.68  to  1.03, 
p=0.0885).  Gefitinib  250  mg  was  associated  with  an  18%  reduction  in  the  risk  of  treatment  failure 
compared  with  placebo  (ITT  population:  HR  0.82,  95%  CI  0.73  to  0.92,  p=0.0006).  Objective 
responses were achieved for 77 (8.0%, 1 complete response and 76 partial responses) patients in the 
gefitinib  250-mg  group  compared  with  6  (1.3%)  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  No  significant 
differences  were  observed  in  terms  of  survival  outcomes  in  relation  to  EGFR  expression  status 
Page 57 of 86 
 
 
 
although patients with EGFR-positive tumours achieve better outcomes when treated with gefitinib as 
opposed to placebo than patients with EGFR-negative tumours (EGFR expression status-by-treatment 
interaction, p=0.0488). 
Quality of life including disease-related symptoms during treatment with gefitinib 250 mg was similar 
to  placebo.  Gefitinib  provided  more  symptomatic  control  than  placebo;  the  difference  was  not 
considered clinically relevant according to the pre-defined criteria of ≥2-point difference in LCS score 
(Evaluable  for  QOL  population:  mean  change  from  baseline  in  LCS  score  [gefitinibplacebo]  0.51 
points,  95%  CI  0.08  to  0.94,  p=0.0192).  The  overall  compliance  for  completion  of  the  FACT-L 
questionnaire was 86% and 85% for gefitinib and placebo, respectively. No clinically relevant changes 
in mean QOL or symptom scores were observed over the course of the study. 
Ancillary analyses 
Several subgroup analyses were planned in advance of unblinding the study data. Increased response 
rates were observed with gefitinib therapy in all subgroups with the largest differences among patients 
who had never smoked, were female, of Asian racial origin, or had adenocarcinoma histology.

The applicant performed a pooled multivariate logistic regression model analysis from patients in the 
INTEREST, INVITE, ISEL, INTACT I and II and IDEAL I and II trials (786 Caucasian patients) to 
identify  clinical  factors  that  may  predict  EGFR  mutation  status.  Clinical  characteristics  of  never 
smoker, adenocarcinoma histology, and female gender have been shown to be independent predictors 
of positive EGFR mutation status in a multivariate analysis Caucasian patients from gefitinib studies 
(Table 28).  Asian patients also have a higher incidence of EGFR mutation-positive tumours.

•  Clinical studies in special populations 
There were no studies in special population that were conducted.  
•  Supportive study(ies) 
The two pivotal studies are supported by three additional studies of gefitinib versus docetaxel in the 
same clinical setting as INTEREST - the Japanese Phase III V-15-32 study (490 patients), the Phase II 
SIGN  study  (141  patients),  and  the  Korean  post-marketing  ISTANA  study  (161  patients),  that 
collectively with INTEREST provide efficacy and safety results from over 2200 patients.

V-15-32 
The trial V-15-32 failed to meet its non-inferiority objective. Survival point estimates overall and in 
most reasonably large subgroups tended to favour docetaxel despite that this study was conducted in a 
Japanese population and at a relatively low dose of docetaxel (60 mg/m2).  
SIGN 
This  Phase  II  study  recruited  patients  from  25 centres  in  12 countries  (non-Asian),  and  were 
representative  of  an  advanced  NSCLC  population  who  had  failed  previous  chemotherapy  and  were 
eligible  for  second-line  treatment.  Mean  change  from  baseline  scores  for  symptom  improvement 
(assessed  by  LCS)  and  QoL  (FACT-L)  were  similar  for  gefitinib  and  docetaxel  treated  patients. 
Improvement rates were numerically higher for gefitinib compared with docetaxel, but the differences 
were not statistically significant. 
ISTANA 
The trial ISTANA enrolled a high percentage of never-smokers (41%) and all patients were Asian. A 
high  response  rate  was  reported  in  the  gefitinib  arm  (28%)  and  PFS  tended  to  be  longer  HR:  0.7, 
p=0.09. The survival data are immature to draw any meaningful conclusions. 
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  IPASS  study  recruited  an  enriched  patient  population  who  had  biological  factors  that  had  been 
previously  identified  in  the  ISEL  and  IDEAL  studies  as  conferring  greater  clinical  benefit  derived 
from  gefitinib  treatment.  The  ISEL  study  had  identified  a  subgroup  of  patients  who  were  never 
smokers and of Asian origin which benefited the most and the two Phase II studies IDEAL I and II 
had  identified  patients  with  adenocarcinoma  who  had  a  high  rate  of  response  to  gefitinib.    Overall, 
disease characteristics at entry were well balanced across the two treatment groups. The trial met its 
primary endpoint in the overall population where PFS was considered improved in the gefitinib arm 
compared to the doublet chemotherapy [HR 0.74; 95%CI 0.65-0.85; p<0.0001]. The subgroup analysis 
(male, female, never smokers, ex-smokers, age and whether it is locally advance or metastatic) showed 
that there were no major differences between the subgroups. At the time of submission, the OS data 
was not mature. Preliminary data on OS showed that both treatment arms were comparable (HR 0.91; 
95%CI 0.76-1.10). However, the data on OS is difficult to interpret because of the cross-over design of 
the trial which may confound the survival data. The median survival was 18.6 months with gefitinib 
compared to 17.3 months for the doublet chemotherapy. Patients treated with gefitinib experienced an 
improvement in QoL compared to the doublet chemotherapy.  
A significant interaction was observed between treatment with gefitinib and EGFR mutation in terms 
of  PFS.  PFS  was  significantly  longer  with  gefitinib  than  carboplatin/paclitaxel  treatment  in  patients 
who  were  EGFR  M+  with  a  HR  of  0.48  (95%CI  0.36-0.64;  p<0.0001)  while  PFS  was  significantly 
shorter with gefitinib than carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment in patients who were EGFR M- with a HR 
of 2.85 (95%CI 2.05-3.98; p<0.0001). No relevant activity was observed for gefitinib in patients with 
EGFR FISH+ and EGFR M- tumours. Similar results were observed in a pooled analysis of ORR from 
studies INTEREST, ISEL  and INVITE where in patients that were EGFR FISH- and EGFR M- the 
ORR  was  5/69  (7.2%)  versus  7/155  (4.5%)  in  patients  with  EGFR  FISH+  and  EGFR  M-  tumours. 
Therefore,  using  EGFR  FISH  status  as  a  marker  to  predict  patient  benefit  with  gefitinib  is  not 
considered appropriate. 
Two exploratory post-hoc analyses were presented in the IPASS study, an analysis of OS by EGFR 
mutation status and QoL by mutation status. OS appeared more favourable in patients that were EGFR 
M+ and treated with gefitinib rather than doublet chemotherapy (HR 0.776; 95%CI 0.500-1.202). A 
greater improvement in QoL as measured by FACT-L and TOI was shown in EGFR M+ patients. The 
opposite was observed in EGFR M- patients, where there was an improvement in favour of the doublet 
chemotherapy.  When  analysing  time  to  worsening  and  disease-related  symptoms  as  measured  by 
FACT-L and TOI, the results obtained were consistent and comparable to that observed for QoL. The 
very  low  activity  of  gefitinib  in  terms  of  response  rate  in  EGFR  M-  tumours,  1.1%,  is  worth 
highlighting. It is important to note that the mutation detection methodology used in IPASS differed 
from  those  employed  in  previous  studies  with  gefitinib.  While  previous  studies  used  Sanger 
Sequencing  technology,  the  method  of  choice  for  IPASS  was  ARMS  using  the  EGFR  29  Mutation 
Page 61 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
Test Kit (DxS). This assay has shown improved sensitivity. Thus the number of false negative samples 
is likely to be smaller in IPASS and because of the very high activity of EGFR in EGFR M+ tumours, 
a  small  percentage  of  false  negative  samples  would  affect  the  apparent  activity  of  gefitinib  in  a 
“mutation negative” tumours. 
The INTEREST trial was a randomised, open label, multicentre, Phase III double arm trial, comparing 
once-daily oral gefitinib 250 mg with 3-weekly intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in 1466 patients with 
locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  who  had  previously  received  platinum-based  chemotherapy 
and were eligible for further chemotherapy (second-line therapy). The primary analysis met the non-
inferiority criterion (1.154) with a confidence interval upper limit of 1.150. However, the per protocol, 
co-variate  adjusted  analysis,  did  not  fall  within  the  predefined  acceptance  limits  and  a  median 
difference in survival , in the worst case scenario, of about 1.2 months in favour of docetaxel could be 
a possibility. In the overall population, the OS was 7.6 versus 8.0 months (HR 1.020; 96%CI 0.905-
1.150)  for  gefitinib  and  docetaxel-treated  patients, respectively.  In  the  EGFR M+  status patients,  no 
differences  in  OS  were  observed  but,  notably,  the  ORR  were  42.1%  and  21.1%  (OR  25.2;  95%CI 
1.23-515.53; p=0.036) for gefitinib and docetaxel, respectively. For PFS, the median was 7.0 vs 4.1 
months (HR 0.16, 95%CI 0.05-0.49; p=0.0012] for gefitinib and docetaxel, respectively. For patients 
that  were  never  smokers,  PFS  had  HR  0.60  (95%CI  0.45-0.79,  p=0.0004),  the  ORR  was  23.7%  vs 
13.3% for gefitinib compared to docetaxel. 
The  ISEL  study  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  Phase III  study  comparing  overall  survival  of 
gefitinib 250mg plus BSC  versus placebo plus BSC in pre-treated patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic  NSCLC  who  were  not  suitable for  further  chemotherapy.  The  survival  difference  did  not 
reach  statistical  significance  in  the  primary  stratified log-rank  test;  OS  for  gefitinib  was  5.6  months 
and  5.1  months  for  BSC  (HR  0.89;  95%CI  0.77-1.02;  p=0.0871).  Improved  TTF  of  3.0  months 
compared to  2.6  months  for  gefitinib  and  placebo (HR 0.82;  95%CI  0.73-0.92;  p=0.0006) and  ORR 
8.0%  versus  1.3%  (OR  7.3,  95%CI  3.1-16.9)  were  observed  for  gefitinib  and  placebo,  respectively. 
Exploratory  biomarker  analyses  revealed  EGFR  FISH+  was  a  strong  predictive  factor  for  response. 
Higher response rates were observed in gefitinib-treated patients harbouring EGFR M+ (37.5% vs 0% 
for  gefitinib  and  placebo,  respectively)  than  for  EGFR  M-  (2.6%  vs  0%  for  gefitinib  and  placebo, 
respectively). 
The  CHMP  noted  the  heterogeneity  in  tumour  responses  in  relation  to  PFS  and  ORR  in  different 
subgroups  analysed  in  the  INTEREST  trial  as  well  as  in  the  other  supportive  studies,  where  some 
subgroups  faired  better  with  gefitinib  while  other  did  better  with  docetaxel  treatment.  Amongst  the 
subgroups identified were patients who are female, of Asian racial origin, those with adenocarcinoma 
histology,  never/light  smokers  (analyses  in  a  proportional  hazards  model  showed  a  statistically 
significant interaction between gefitinib treatment and never smokers for PFS), EGFR FISH+ but the 
data was in particular stronger for patients with EGFR activating mutation (M+). As the INTEREST 
trial had included many Asian patients, a subgroup analysis was performed to ascertain the validity of 
the  results  in  the  overall  population  to  the  Caucasian  only  population.  The  results  of  the  subgroup 
analyses  in  the  Caucasian  population  for  OS,  PFS  and  ORR  were  consistent  with  the  results  in  the 
overall population which showed that ORR performed better in the subgroups of never/ever smokers 
and  patients  presenting  EGFR  FISH+  tumours  and  PFS  in  the  subgroup  of  never  smokers  was 
favourable  to  gefitinib.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  data  from  the  overall  population 
could be extrapolated to the Caucasian population.  
There  was  higher  response  rate  in  Asians  than  in  non-Asian  in  EGFR  M+  tumours  from  a  pooled 
analysis of data from clinical trials and the literature. The reason for this is unexpected and may be an 
issue  related  to  the  methodology  used  for  testing  as  the  prevalence  of  mutation  positive  tumours  is 
much higher in Asians. A moderately lower but relevant activity is observed in pre-treated patients. 
Although the activity observed in non-Asians is lower than in Asians (ORR, PFS and OS in the Asian 
population tended to be longer than for the non-Asian population), the CHMP acknowledged that the 
activity  is  still high  at 56%  ORR  (n=243,  pooled lines  of  therapy).  Nonetheless,  the  low  number  of 
first-line non-Asian patients with EGFR M+ tumours is of concern and the applicant has committed to 
perform a trial in the Caucasian population in EGFR M+ to further confirm the results.   
Page 62 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
The  difference  in  OS  and  ORR  between  gefitinib-treated  Asians  and  gefitinib-treated  Caucasians 
could partly be accounted for by the mutation status of EGFR, but not by EGFR FISH status. EGFR 
mutations  occur  more  frequently  in  Asians  (40%  vs  10%)  and  therefore  these  higher  rates  translate 
into  better  efficacy  with  gefitinib.  When  assessing  the  EGFR  mutation  status  of  a  patient,  it  is 
important  that  a  well-validated  and  robust  methodology  is  chosen  to  avoid  false  negative  or  false 
positive determinations.  
The CHMP consulted the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) in Oncology to provide guidance on the 
significance of the clinical benefit observed in the context of the trials conducted in a predominantly 
Asian  patient  population  with  a  defined  genetic  criteria  of  tumours  harbouring  EGFR  activating 
mutations  and  the  applicability  of  defining  and  treating  a  patient  population  based  on  their  EGFR 
mutation status in a clinical practice.  
The  SAG  expressed  concerns  about  the  results  submitted,  in  particular  about  the  large  amount  of 
missing data with respect to EGFR mutation status which should have been controlled by design and 
conduct  of  the  clinical  studies.  In  this  respect,  the  clinical  studies  presented  were  considered  to  be 
inadequate  in  view  of  the  vast  amount  of  data  available  in  the  literature  and  available  regulatory 
guidance about the importance of tumour material for identifying a population more likely to respond 
with  this  type  of  agents.  A  more  careful  design  and  conduct  of  the  clinical  studies  would  have 
established  the  benefits  of  gefitinib  more  efficiently  and  convincingly,  and  would  have  identified 
populations  more  likely  to  respond  in  a  more  reliable  way  leading  to  better  patient  selection. 
According  to  the  SAG,  the  applicant  should  commit  to  conduct  further  postmarketing  studies  to 
explore ways to further improve patient selection based on tumour biology data. 
Despite the fact that the design and conduct of the studies presented was considered to be inadequate, 
the SAG unanimously agreed that across all studies gefitinib shows a consistent pattern of activity in 
EGFR  mutation  status  positive  patients.  Although  the  issue  could  have  been  addressed  more 
efficiently  and  convincingly  with  well  designed  and  conducted  studies  based  on  adequate  tumour 
tissue availability for all patients, the evidence across trials is consistent and supported by clinical and 
non-clinical pharmacodynamic data from numerous independent sources in the literature. 
The  SAG  unanimously  agreed  that  a  strong  recommendation  to  limit  treatment  with  gefitinib  to 
patients with documented evidence of activating EGFR mutation based on reliable assays is supported 
by the data presented. Adequate warnings should be included in the product information about the fact 
that clinical predictors such as smoking history, histology or sex are unreliable predictors of response 
to  gefitinib  and  should  not  be  used  to  replace  EGFR  mutation  status  based  on  reliable  assays, 
whenever  it  is  possible  to  use  such  assays.  However,  there  should  be  no  absolute  restriction  of  the 
indication or absolute contraindication in case of unavailability of such assays. 
The  SAG  unanimously  agreed  that  a  restriction  to  patients  with  activating  EGFR  mutation  positive 
tumours is feasible from a clinical perspective because in current clinical practice a diagnosis should 
be established based on biopsy data, so that EGFR mutation status should be available for the majority 
of patients. Where this is for some reason not possible, treatment with gefitinib should still be possible 
but strong warnings should be provided in the product information that clinical predictors of response 
can be used to select patients but they are poor predictors of the population most likely to respond, and 
that patient selection based on clinical characteristics alone may result in unnecessary under and over-
exposure to gefitinib. 
The  SAG  unanimously  agreed  that  a  restriction  by  line  of  therapy  is  not  supported  by  the  data 
presented. 
The  SAG  unanimously  agreed  that  there  is  no  need  to  conduct  a  confirmatory  first-line  study  in 
Caucasian patients, although further data from e.g., single-arm studies to be conducted post-marketing 
looking  at  response  rate  in  a  well  defined  Caucasian  population  with  documented  EGFR  mutation 
status  should  be  conducted  to  better  define  the  level  of  activity  and  further  explore  predictors  of 
response. 
Having received and discussed the SAG recommendations, the CHMP concluded that EGFR mutation 
status may account for the benefit observed in patients treated with gefitinib. Thus, based on the data 
and the views of the SAG Oncology, the CHMP considered that the indication should be restricted to 
Page 63 of 86 
 
 
patients  harbouring  activating  mutations  as  this  subgroup  of  patients  appeared  to  derive  the  most 
clinically meaningful benefit from gefitinib therapy. 
During the procedure the applicant addressed other issues which pertained to the statistical analysis of 
the primary endpoints and the presentation of a number of subgroup analyses (smokers versus never-
smokers,  adenocarcinoma  histology  versus  non-adenocarcinoma  histology,  Asian  versus  non-Asian, 
male versus females, EGFR FISH+ versus FISH-, k-Ras+ versus k-Ras-) from the different submitted 
trials  with  respect  to  the  efficacy  of  gefitinib  in  terms  of  OS,  PFS  and  ORR.  The  “never  smoker” 
group were found to have the highest predictive value for EGFR M+ tumours, followed by histology 
of adenocarcinoma and gender where females appear to have a higher probability to have EGFR M+ 
tumours.  
Gefitinib has a mean steady state volume of distribution of 1400 l indicating extensive distribution into 
tissue.  Plasma  protein  binding  is  approximately  90 %.  Gefitinib  binds  to  serum  albumin  and  alpha 
1-acid  glycoprotein.  Following  oral  administration  of  gefitinib,  absorption  is  moderately  slow  and 
peak  plasma  concentrations  of  gefitinib  typically  occur  at  3  to  7  hours  after  administration.  Mean 
absolute  bioavailability  is  59 %  in  cancer  patients.  Studies  pertinent  to  the  evaluating  the  effect  of 
substances that elevate gastric pH demonstrated an impaired bioavailability of gefitinib which could 
potentially decrease the efficacy of the treatment. Exposure to gefitinib is not significantly altered by 
food. In a trial in healthy volunteers where gastric pH was maintained above pH 5, gefitinib exposure 
was reduced by 47 %, likely due to impaired solubility of gefitinib in the stomach (see SmPC sections 
4.4 and 4.5). In vitro data indicate that CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are  the major P450 isozyme involved 
in the oxidative metabolism of gefitinib. In vitro studies have shown that gefitinib has limited potential 
to inhibit CYP2D6. Gefitinib shows no enzyme induction effects in animal studies and no significant 
inhibition (in vitro) of any other cytochrome P450 enzyme.  
Gefitinib is extensively metabolised in humans.  Five metabolites have been fully identified in excreta 
and  8  metabolites  in  plasma.    The  major  metabolite  identified  was  O-desmethyl  gefitinib,  which  is 
14-fold  less  potent  than  gefitinib  at  inhibiting  EGFR  stimulated  cell  growth  and  has  no  inhibitory 
effect  on  tumour  cell  growth  in  mice.  It  is  therefore  considered  unlikely  that  it  contributes  to  the 
clinical activity of gefitinib.The formation of O-desmethyl gefitinib has been shown, in vitro, to be via 
CYP2D6.  The role of CYP2D6 in the metabolic clearance of gefitinib has been evaluated in a clinical 
trial in healthy volunteers genotyped for CYP2D6 status.  In poor metabolisers no measurable levels of 
O-desmethyl  gefitinib  were  produced.    The  levels  of  exposure  to  gefitinib  achieved  in  both  the 
extensive  and  the  poor  metaboliser  groups  were  wide  and  overlapping  but  the  mean  exposure  to 
gefitinib was 2-fold higher in the poor metaboliser group.  The higher average exposures that could be 
achieved by individuals with no active CYP2D6 may be clinically relevant since adverse effects are 
related to dose and exposure. 
Concomitant  use  of  CYP3A4  inhibitors  or  inducers  showed  an  altered  effect  on  gefitinib 
pharmacokinetics  which  could  lead  to  clinical  significant  effect,  as  CYP2D6  is  a  metaboliser  for 
gefitinib;  the  effect  of  an  inhibitor  on  gefitinib  bioavailability  might  be  especially  important  (see 
section  4.5  in  SmPC).  The  observed  CYP3A4  interactions  with  itraconazole  and  rifampicin  were 
described. Pre-treatment with itraconazole resulted in an 80% increase in the mean AUC of gefitinib 
whereas pre-treatment with rifampicin reduced the mean AUC by 83% of gefitinib (see section 4.5 in 
SmPC). In addition, published literature indicates that gefitinib might be a potent inhibitor of BCRP 
(see section 4.5 in the SmPC).  The applicant justified the lack of in vivo data on interaction between 
gefitinib  and  substrates  for  CYP2C19,  CYP3A4  and  UGT1A1  as  it  was  unlikely  that  an  interaction 
could  be  observed  because  of  the  low  inhibition  observed  in  vitro  at  very  high  concentration  of 
gefitinib  and  an  no  changes  in  AUC  of  an  active  metabolite  cleared  by  UGT1A1  were  observed  in 
animal  models  with  gefitinib.  In  vitro  data  indicate  that  gefitinib  is  a  substrate  for  the  membrane 
transport protein Pgp. 
Gefitinib  is  excreted  mainly  as  metabolites  via  the  faeces,  with  renal  elimination  of  gefitinib  and 
metabolites accounting for less than 4 % of the administered dose.  
Page 64 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gefitinib  total  plasma  clearance  is  approximately  500 ml/min  and  the  mean  terminal  half-life  is  41 
hours  in  cancer  patients.  Administration  of  gefitinib  once  daily  results  in  2  to  8-fold  accumulation, 
with  steady  state  exposures  achieved  after  7  to  10  doses.  At  steady  state,  circulating  plasma 
concentrations are typically maintained within a 2- to 3-fold range over the 24-hour dosing interval. 
Clinical safety 
The total estimated exposure to gefitinib as of January 2008 was greater than 275 000 patients. The 
majority of patients (98%) received a 250 mg daily dose and the majority of patient exposure (71%) 
was  in  patients  receiving  gefitinib  during  the  marketed  use.  An  estimated  80  000  patients 
(approximately  29%  of  total  exposure)  were  exposed  to  gefitinib  in  clinical  studies,  of  which 
approximately 58 000 received gefitinib treatment as part of the Expanded Access Programme.  
•  Patient exposure 
The  majority  of  patients  in  clinical  studies  (90%)  received  gefitinib  for  the  treatment  of  advanced 
NSCLC, with the remaining exposure to gefitinib being distributed across a range of investigational 
tumour indications (mainly breast, head and neck, colorectal, central nervous system, gastrointestinal 
and  ovarian  cancers).  Approximately  2  800  patients  received  gefitinib  250  mg  monotherapy  in  key 
clinical studies in advanced NSCLC.  
The duration of treatment in the INTEREST study was at least one dose of gefitinib in 729 patients 
and at least one dose of docetaxel in 715 patients. The overall median exposure to study treatment was 
2.4  months  for  gefitinib  and  2.8  months  for  docetaxel.  Docetaxel  was  administered  for  a  median 
number  of  4  cycles  (range  1  to  24  with  82.2%  of  all  cycles  given  at  the  full  dose).  More  gefitinib 
treated patients received treatment for longer than 6 months. In the IPASS study, overall exposure to 
first-line  study  treatment was  longer  with  gefitinib than  carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment  (medians  of 
5.6  months  and  4.1  months,  respectively).  A  high  percentage  of  gefitinib-treated  patients  received 
treatment for longer than 6 months (47.6%) compared with none in the carboplatin / paclitaxel group. 
The  median  and  mean  number  of  chemotherapy  cycles  administered  were 6.0 and  4.6, respectively. 
Dose  modifications  (interruptions,  delays  and  reductions)  because  of  toxicity  were  less  common  in 
patients treated with gefitinib (16.1%) compared with carboplatin / paclitaxel (35.2%/37.5%) 
•  Adverse events  
In the ISEL study, the overall incidence of AEs was higher for gefitinib than for placebo (Table 29). 
The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation or AEs leading to death were low in both treatment 
groups,  but  were  slightly  higher  for  the  gefitinib  group.  No  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the 
frequency of SAEs or CTC grade 3 or 4 AEs were evident between the treatment groups.

In  the  INTEREST  study,  the  most  commonly  reported  AEs  for  gefitinib  were  rash/acne,  diarrhoea, 
vomiting,  asthenic  conditions,  anorexia,  nausea,  dry  skin,  cough  and  dyspnoea  (Table  31).  These 
events  were  mostly  CTC  grade  1  or  2.  Patients  with  poorly  tolerated  diarrhoea  or  skin  adverse 
reactions  may  be  successfully  managed  by  providing  a  brief  (up  to  14  days)  therapy  interruption 
followed  by  reinstatement  of  the  250 mg  dose  (see  section  4.8).    For  patients  unable  to  tolerate 
treatment  after  a  therapy  interruption,  IRESSA  should  be  discontinued  and  an  alternative  treatment 
should be considered (see SmPC section 4.2). A pooled dataset for adverse reactions from the ISEL, 
INTEREST  and  IPASS  clinical  trials  is  presented  in  Table  32.  The  safety  profile  is  based  on  the

assigned frequency categories based on the incidence in the pooled dataset. 
Docetaxel  was  most  commonly  associated  with  haematological  toxicity  (derived  from  the 
haematological  laboratory  data),  and  AE  reports  of  asthenic  conditions,  alopecia,  nausea,  diarrhoea 
and neurotoxicity. Most AEs for docetaxel were CTC grade 1 or 2, with the exception of AE reports of 
neutropenia and leukopenia, where the majority of AEs were CTC grade 3 or 4.

Clinically significant laboratory findings were only reported as adverse events if a criterion for a serious adverse event 
was  fulfilled, the abnormality caused study treatment to be discontinued, or the investigator insisted the abnormality 
was  to  be  reported  as  an  adverse  event.    Therefore,  laboratory  findings  worsening  from  baseline  to  CTC  grade  3  or 
4should be referred to for the primary assessment of haematological toxicity. 
Grouped terms were specified as follows.  Stomatitis (aphthous stomatitis, mouth ulceration, oral mucosal eruption, and 
stomatitis);  Asthenic conditions (asthenia, fatigue,  malaise, and prostration); Fluid retention (fluid retention, oedema,

The safety profile presented in Table 32 is based on the gefitinib clinical development programme and 
postmarketed experience.  Adverse reactions have been assigned to the frequency categories in Table 
32  based  on  the  incidence  of  comparable  adverse  event  reports  in  a  pooled  dataset  from  the  ISEL, 
INTEREST  and  IPASS  phase  III  clinical  trials  (2462  IRESSA-treated  patients).    Frequencies  of 
occurrence of undesirable effects are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (> 1/100 to < 1/10); 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

1  This event can occur in association with other dry conditions (mainly skin reactions) seen with 
IRESSA. 
2  These frequencies were calculated based on patients with a change from baseline of 2 or more 
CTC  grades  in  the  relevant  laboratory  parameters.  As  these  calculations  were  based  on 
laboratory  data  rather  than  adverse  event  data,  the  denominator  for  the  calculation  was  the 
number  of  patients  with  a  baseline  laboratory  value  and  at  least  one  post-baseline  value  for 
each relevant parameter, rather than the number of patients evaluable for safety. 
3  The  overall  incidence  of  Adverse  Events  (AEs)  of  allergic  reaction  reported  in  the  pooled 
analysis of the ISEL, INTEREST and IPASS trials was 1.5% (36 patients). Fourteen of the 36 
patients  were  excluded  from  the  reported  frequency  as  their  reports  contained  evidence  of 
either  a  non  allergic  aetiology  or  that  the  allergic  reaction  was  the  result  of  treatment  with 
another medicine 
4  The proteinuria frequency descriptor was calculated based on the number of patients in ISEL 
and  INTEREST  with  deterioration  from  baseline  of  3  or  more  categories  of  proteinuria  as 
measured by urinalysis. IPASS data was not included in the calculation as urinalysis data was 
not routinely collected in the study and only a limited amount of data was available. 
Page 70 of 86 
CTC grade 3 or 4 adverse events 
In the INTEREST study, 272 patients (37.3%), and 400 patients (55.9%) in the gefitinib and docetaxel 
treatment groups, respectively, had at least one AE of CTC grade 3 or 4. Fewer CTC grade 3 or 4 AEs 
and fewer treatment-related CTC grades 3 or 4 AEs were reported with gefitinib than with docetaxel. 
The  only  CTC  grade  3  or  4  AE  commonly  reported  with  gefitinib  (≥5%)  was  dyspnoea.  This  was 
reported  at  a  slightly  higher  incidence  on  the  docetaxel  arm  and  is  probably  indicative  of  the 
underlying  disease.  AEs  commonly  reported  for  gefitinib,  diarrhoea,  nausea,  vomiting  and  asthenic 
conditions, were more frequently reported as CTC grade 3 or 4 AEs with docetaxel than gefitinib.  
In the IPASS study, a total of 192 patients (31.6%) in the gefitinib arm and 368 patients (62.5%) in the 
carboplatin / paclitaxel arm had at least 1 AE of CTC grade 3, 4 or 5.  Fewer CTC grade 3, 4 or 5 AEs 
and  fewer  treatment-related  CTC  grade  3,  4  or  5  AEs  were  reported  with  gefitinib  than  with 
carboplatin  /  paclitaxel.    The  most  commonly  reported  CTC  grade  3,  4  or  5  AEs  (≥3%)  were  ALT 
increased,  diarrhoea  and  hepatic  function  abnormal  with  gefitinib,  and  neutropenia,  leukopenia, 
anaemia, neutrophil count decreased, and white blood cell decreased with carboplatin / paclitaxel. The 
CTC grade 3, 4 or 5 AEs reported on each treatment arm were generally consistent with the known 
safety  profiles  of  the  two  treatments  and  the  underlying  disease.  The  majority  of  AEs  of 
haematological toxicity reported on the gefitinib arm (neutropenia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia and 
bone marrow failure) were reported during the 28-day follow up period, when patients were receiving 
2nd line chemotherapy.   
•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In  the  INTEREST  study,  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  lower  for  gefitinib  than  for  docetaxel;  161 
(22.1%) and 210 (29.4%), respectively. The most frequently reported SAE in the gefitinib treatment 
group  was  pneumonia  (2.5%)  which  was  reported at a  similar rate  in the  docetaxel  treatment  group 
(2.9%).  More  of  the  docetaxel  treated  patients  experienced  at  least  one  SAE,  particularly  febrile 
neutropenia (1.1% vs 7.6%, gefitinib and docetaxel, respectively) and other haematological toxicities 
such  as  neutropenia  (2.4%),  anemia  (0.7%),  granulocytopenia  (0.6%)  and  leucopenia  (0.6%).  The 
SAEs  of  febrile  neutropenia  or  neutropenia  in  the  gefitinib  treatment  group  occurred  after 
discontinuation of gefitinib and while the patient was receiving post treatment chemotherapy.  
Fewer gefitinib treated patients experienced SAEs that were considered to be treatment related; 3.8% 
versus 18.2% of docetaxel treated patients. The most commonly reported treatment-related SAEs for 
the gefitinib and docetaxel treated patients were: febrile neutropenia (0.1% versus 7.6%), neutropenia 
(0 versus 2.4%), pyrexia (0 versus 1.1%), pneumonia (0.3% versus 1.5%), and diarrhoea (1.0% versus 
0.4%). 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) 
The  majority  of  data  on  ILD  has  come  from  post-marketing  use  in  the  Japanese  population,  in 
particular  from  a  post-marketing  surveillance  (PMS)  study,  and  a  pharmacoepidemiological  nested 
case-control  study  (V-15-33).  The  incidence  of  ILD-type  events  was  comparable  in  both  treatment 
groups in the INTEREST trial and IPASS (Table 33). This incidence of ILD-type events is consistent 
with that reported in the ISEL study. The reporting rate in the pooled data from INTEREST and ISEL 
is 1.1%.

EFS=Evaluable for safety.; N=Number of patients. 
Based  on  available  data  received  as  of  January  2008,  from  worldwide  clinical  studies,  expanded 
access/compassionate  use  and  post  marketing  use,  the  estimated  reporting  rate  of  ILD-type  events 
overall is estimated to be 0.8% (approximately 0.2% outside of Japan and approximately 3% in Japan). 
Of the reported ILD-type events, approximately 36% have a fatal outcome (32% outside of Japan and 
37% in Japan). A special warning has been introduced in the SmPC in relation to the risk of ILD. 
Ophthalmological event 
Based  on  animal  toxicology  studies  demonstrating  dose  and  duration  related  corneal  translucencies 
and opacities (see non-clinical section), a comprehensive ophthalmology monitoring was conducted in 
the  Phase  I  and  II  studies.  The  246  healthy  volunteers  from  the  Phase  I  studies  underwent 
ophthalmological assessments and there were no observations related to the non-clinical findings but 
corneal  ulcer  occurring  at  higher  doses  of  gefitinib  which  healed  rapidly.  In  the  Phase  II  studies 
IDEAL I and II studies no evidence of any consistent or drug-related ophthalmological toxicity were 
demonstrated. There were more events in the Eye Disorders SOC reported in the INTEREST study by 
patients  in  the  gefitinib  arm  (9.2%)  than  in  the  docetaxel  arm  (6.9%).  Individual  event  terms  were 
reported  by  small  numbers  of  patients,  with  the  exception  of  conjunctivitis  (2.9%  for  gefitinib  and 
1.4% for docetaxel) and dry eye (1.8% for gefitinib and 0.4% for docetaxel).  
ECG abnormalities 
Cardiovascular  monitoring  was  performed  in  the  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  studies.  Cardiovascular 
monitoring of 246 healthy volunteers revealed no clinically significant abnormalities in these subjects. 
Comparable results were obtained in other studies included the INTEREST study. 
Hepatoxicity  
In  the  INTEREST  study  the  incidence  of  AEs  from  the  hepatobiliary  SOC  was  low  in  both  the 
gefitinib  and  docetaxel  treatment  arms  (12  patients (1.6%)  and  8 patients  (1.1%),  respectively). The 
frequency  of  transaminase  changes  were  higher  with  gefitinib  than  with  docetaxel,  although  the 
majority  of  transaminase  changes  observed  were  mild  to  moderate.  Although  liver  function  test 
abnormalities  (including  increases  in  alanine  aminotransferase,  aspartate  aminotransferase  and 
bilirubin)  were  common,  they  were  rarely  observed  as  hepatitis  (see  SmPC  section  4.4  and  4.8). 
Therefore, periodic liver function testing is recommended. Gefitinib should be used cautiously in the 
presence  of  mild  to  moderate  changes  in  liver  function.  Discontinuation  should  be  considered  if 
changes  are  severe.  Impaired  liver  function  due  to  cirrhosis  has  been  shown  to  lead  to  increased 
plasma concentrations of gefitinib (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Renal disorders  
There was low incidence of AEs from the renal and urinary disorder SOC in the INTEREST trial (34 
patients (4.7%) and 30 patients (4.2%) respectively in the gefitinib and docetaxel treatment arm). The 
results from other studies were consistent with the INTEREST study.

Deaths 
Of the 1444 patients in the safety population of the INTEREST study, 1180 (81.7%) had died by the 
data cut-off date of 06 March 2007 (82.2% of gefitinib-treated patients and 81.3% of docetaxel-treated 
patients). The incidence  of  SAE  leading  to  death  was  4.3%  and  3.9%  in  the  gefitinib  and  docetaxel 
groups, respectively. The most common SAE leading to death in both treatment arms was pneumonia. 
The  incidence  of  individual  SAEs  leading  to  death  were  similar  across  the  two  treatment  groups 
except  for  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  dyspnoea  and  haemoptysis  in  the  gefitinib-treatment  group 
(0.4% each), and a slightly higher incidence of febrile neutropenia and septic shock in the docetaxel-
treatment  group  0.6%  and  0.4%,  respectively.  The  treatment-related  SAEs  that  led  to  death  in  the 
gefitinib treated patients were: ILD, pneumonia, hepatitis, dyspnoea and renal failure/diarrhoea. 
•  Laboratory findings 
There  was  a  difference  observed  between  the  gefitinib  and  docetaxel  treatment  in  the  INTEREST 
study  in  terms  of  the  laboratory  findings  for  white  blood  cell  count  and  absolute  neutrophils.  The 
number of patients worsening from baseline to CTC grade 3/4 leukopenia in the docetaxel arm was 
more pronounced than in the gefitinib arm (42.3% vs 1.8%, for WBC and 58.2% vs 2.2%, for ANC, 
respectively).  The  frequency  of  clinically  relevant  deteriorations  of  haemoglobin  and  platelet  count 
was low for both docetaxel and gefitinib treatments (8,6% vs 2.1% for haemoglobin and 2.9% vs 1.4% 
for  platelet  count,  respectively)  but  more  docetaxel-treated  patients  experienced  deterioration  of 
haemoglobin levels. The laboratory results from the IPASS were comparable and are consistent with 
the expected higher toxicity of carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy therapy. 
The  deteriorations  of  two  or  more  CTC  grades  from  baseline  in  creatinine  levels  were  higher  in 
gefitinib-treated patients (2.2%) and than docetaxel-treated patients (1.2%) in the  INTEREST study. 
Similar results were observed for the IPASS study. 
In the INTEREST study, an increased frequency of haematuria and proteinuria was observed among 
gefitinib-treated  patients  (7.2%  and  9.9%,  respectively)  as  compared  to  docetaxel  treated  patients 
(4.4% and 2.1%, respectively)  
•  Safety in special populations 
The evaluation of safety in special populations is derived predominantly from the INTEREST study. 
There  were  no  differences  in  gender,  ethnicity,  histology,  hypertension,  renal  impaired  patients  and 
smoking status on the reporting of SAE. There was an increase in worsening of the SAE, CTC grade 3 
and 4 and AE leading to death with worsening of baseline performance status, increased weight of the 
patient and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for gefitinib and docetaxel.  
The  review  of  AEs  by  age  range  (i.e.,  <45  years;  45  to  64  years;  65  to  74  years;  ≥75  years)  was 
conducted  using  data  from  the  INTEREST  study.  There  was  a  general  tendency  for  increases  in 
reporting of SAEs, grade 3/4 AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation in the two older age groups on 
both  treatments.  In  both  treatment  groups,  there  were  similar  incidences  with  increased  age  in  the 
reporting  of  event  terms  in  most  system  organ  classes  (SOCs).  This  may  reflect  the  underlying 
morbidity  with  increasing  with  age  where  these  events  are  more  commonly  associated  with  elderly 
patients,  e.g.  asthenia,  fatigue,  weight  decrease,  anorexia.  In  the  nervous  system  SOC,  there  was  a 
notable increase in CTC grade 3 or 4 events with age, mostly consisting of cerebrovascular accident 
cases  in  those  over  75  years.  Similarly,  the  respiratory  SOC  appeared  to  show  an  increase  in  CTC 
grade 3 or 4 events with age, primarily due to an increase in dyspnoea. For the risk of developing ILD, 
the  Japanese  Pharmacoepidemiological  Case  Control  study  showed  that  older  age  (≥55  years)  was 
identified  as  a  risk  factor  for  developing  ILD  irrespective  of  the  treatment  received.    The  Japanese 
pharmacoepidemiological  case  control  study  in  3159  patients  with  NSCLC  receiving  gefitinib  or 
chemotherapy  who  were  followed  up  for  12  weeks,  the  following  risk  factors  for  developing  ILD 
(irrespective of whether the patient received gefitinib or chemotherapy) were identified: smoking, poor 
performance status (PS≥ 2), CT scan evidence of reduced normal lung (≤ 50 %), recent diagnosis of 
NSCLC (< 6 months), pre-existing ILD, older age (≥ 55 years old) and concurrent cardiac disease.  An 
increased risk of ILD on gefitinib relative to chemotherapy was seen predominantly during the first 4 
Page 73 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
weeks  of  treatment  (adjusted  OR  3.8;  95 %  CI  1.9  to  7.7);  thereafter  the  relative  risk  was  lower 
(adjusted  OR  2.5;  95 %  CI  1.1  to  5.8).    Risk  of  mortality  among  patients  who  developed  ILD  on 
gefitinib  or  chemotherapy  was  higher  in  patients  with  the  following  risk  factors:  smoking,  CT  scan 
evidence of reduced normal lung (≤ 50 %), pre-existing ILD, older age (≥ 65 years old), and extensive 
areas adherent to pleura (≥ 50 %). However, in the INTEREST trial, the number of ILD-type events 
was  very  small  and  no  apparent  trend  on  either  treatment  group  related  to  age  at  study  entry  was 
found. ILD, which may be acute in onset, has been observed in 1.3 % of patients receiving gefitinib, 
and  some  cases  have  been  fatal  (see  section  4.8).  If  patients  experience  worsening  of  respiratory 
symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough and fever, gefitinib should be interrupted and the patient should be 
promptly  investigated.  If  ILD  is  confirmed,  gefitinib  should  be  discontinued  and  the  patient  treated 
appropriately. 
In  a  phase  I/II  trial  studying  the  use  of  gefitinib  and  radiation  in  paediatric  patients,  with  newly 
diagnosed  brain  stem  glioma  or  incompletely  resected  supratentorial  malignant  glioma,  4  cases  (1 
fatal)  of  Central  Nervous  System  (CNS)  haemorrhages  were  reported  from  45  patients  enrolled.  A 
further case of CNS haemorrhage has been reported in a child with an ependymoma from a trial with 
gefitinib alone.    An  increased  risk  of  cerebral  haemorrhage  in  adult  patients  with  NSCLC  receiving 
gefitinib has not been established. 
In  patients  that  have  moderate  or  severe  hepatic  impairment  as  a  result  of  liver  metastases,  results 
showed that there was no increase in exposure to gefitinib and frequency and severity of AEs (study 
D7913C00032).  Another  study  with  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic  impairment  due  to 
cirrhosis  showed  an  average  of  3.1-fold  increased  exposure  to  gefitinib  which  may  be  of  clinical 
relevance (study D7913C00718). This is reflected as a warning in the SmPC. 
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
CYP3A4 Inhibitors 
An interaction between gefitinib and itraconazole was shown in in vitro and in clinical drug interaction 
studies (0027 and 0051). The concomitant use of gefitinib and itraconazole (200mg single daily dose 
for 12 days) resulted in an increase of gefitinib exposure (60%-80% of AUC). Therefore concurrent 
use  of  CYP3A4  inhibitors  in  patients  taking  gefitinib  may  result  in  increased  plasma  levels  of 
gefitinib. This is reflected in the SmPC as a potential drug interaction. 
CYP3A4 Inducers 
An interaction between gefitinib and rifampicin was shown in a clinical interaction study (0030). The 
concomitant  use  of  gefitinib  and  rifampicin  (300  mg  b.i.d.)  resulted  in  decreased  gefitinib  exposure 
(83%  of  AUC).  This  may  in  turn  decrease  gefitinib  plasma  concentrations  and  reduce  efficacy. 
CYP3A4 inducers may increase metabolism of gefitinib and decrease gefitinib plasma concentrations. 
Therefore,  concomitant  administration  of  CYP3A4  inducers  (e.g.  phenytoin,  carbamazepine, 
rifampicin, barbiturates or herbal preparations containing St John’s wort/Hypericum perforatum) may 
reduce efficacy of the treatment and should be avoided (see SmPC section 4.5).  
CYP2D6 inhibitors 
There were no studies performed exploring the effect of concomitant use of gefitinib and a CYP2D6 
inhibitor.  However,  in  poor  metabolisers  for  CYP2D6,  it  would  be  expected  that  strong  CYP2D6 
inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine and paroxetine) will increase exposure to gefitinib by 2-fold. In individual 
patients  with  CYP2D6  poor  metaboliser  genotype,  treatment  with  a  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor  might 
lead  to  increased  plasma  levels  of  gefitinib.    At  initiation  of  treatment  with  a  CYP3A4  inhibitor, 
patients should be closely monitored for gefitinib adverse reactions (see SmPC section 4.5). 
No clinical studies have been performed exploring the interaction between gefitinib and substrates for 
CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and UGT1A1. 
Gastric pH 
The  effect  of  food  and  the  effect  of  increased  gastric  pH  (≥5)  were  investigated  in  a  clinical  study 
(0036).  The  results  showed  that  food  had  increased  bioavailability  of  gefitinib  by  37%.  In  addition, 
sustained elevation of gastric pH (using 2x450mg ranitidine) resulted in 47% decreased bioavailability 
Page 74 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of  gefitinib.  Medicinal  products  that  cause  significant  sustained  elevation  in  gastric  pH,  such  as 
proton-pump  inhibitors  and  h2-antagonists  may  reduce  bioavailability  and  plasma  concentrations  of 
gefitinib  and,  therefore,  may  reduce  efficacy.    Antacids  if  taken  regularly  close  in  time  to 
administration of gefitinib may have a similar effect (see SmPC sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Vitamin K antagonists 
International  normalised  ratio  (INR)  elevations  and/or  bleeding  events  have  been  reported  in  some 
patients taking warfarin together with gefitinib (see SmPC section 4.5). Patients taking warfarin and 
gefitinib concomitantly should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time (PT) or INR. 
P-glycoprotein (Pgp) inhibitors 
No  Pk  studies  were  performed  to  study  interaction  of  Pgp  inhibitors  with  gefitinib.  In  vitro  studies 
have  shown that  gefitinib  is  a substrate  of  p-glycoprotein  (Pgp).   Available  data  do  not  suggest  any 
clinical consequences to this in vitro finding. 
Lactose 
Gefitinib contains lactose.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp 
lactose deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Other medicinal products 
Data  from  phase  II  clinical  trials,  where  gefitinib  and  vinorelbine  have  been  used  concomitantly, 
indicate that gefitinib may exacerbate the neutropenic effect of vinorelbine. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the  IPASS study, fewer AEs leading to discontinuation were reported for patients in the gefitinib 
arm (6.9%) compared with the carboplatin / paclitaxel arm (13.6%). Commonly reported AEs leading 
to  discontinuation  of  gefitinib  included  abnormal  hepatic  function  (1.5%),  increased  AST  (1.0%), 
increased  ALT  (0.8%)  and  ILD  (0.8%).    Commonly  reported  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of 
carboplatin  /  paclitaxel  included  neutropenia  (3.1%),  drug  hypersensitivity  (1.5%),  hypoaesthesia 
(1.4%), peripheral neuropathy (1.0%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (0.8%). ILD, which may be 
acute in onset, has been observed in 1.3 % of patients receiving gefitinib, and some cases have been 
fatal  (see  SmPC  section  4.8).  If  patients  experience  worsening  of  respiratory  symptoms  such  as 
dyspnoea,  cough  and  fever,  gefitinib  should  be  interrupted  and  the  patient  should  be  promptly 
investigated.  If  ILD  is  confirmed,  gefitinib  should  be  discontinued  and  the  patient  treated 
appropriately. 
In  the  INTEREST  study,  the  number  of  patients  and  incidence  of  patients  with  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation was lower for gefitinib than for docetaxel (8.1%) compared to docetaxel (14.3%). In 
addition,  treatment-related AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were slightly  lower in  the  gefitinib  group 
than  for  docetaxel  (2.3%  compared  to  3.5%).  Commonly  reported  (>0.5%)  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation of gefitinib treatment included skin events (0.8%), ILD (0.5%), and dyspnoea (0.8%). 
Commonly  reported  AEs  (>0.5%)  leading  to  discontinuation  of  docetaxel  were  haematological 
toxicities  (including  febrile  neutropenia  and  neutropenia),  nervous  system  disorders  (including

Gefitinib  is  currently  approved  in  36  countries  worldwide  as  a  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC at a daily dose of 250 mg. The majority of patient 
exposure  (71%;  >195000  patients)  is  in  patients  receiving  gefitinib  during  marketed  use.  The 
following  safety  signals  have  been  raised  from  post-marketing  adverse  event  reports  and  as a  result 
have been incorporated into the proposed SmPC for gefitinib: 
• Interstitial lung disease 
• Pancreatitis 
• Allergic reactions, including angioedema and urticaria 
• Hepatitis 
• Pyrexia

•  Discussion on clinical safety 
In  the  INTEREST  study,  the  most  commonly  reported  AEs  for  gefitinib  were  skin  reactions, 
diarrhoea,  vomiting,  nausea,  anorexia,  asthenic  conditions,  cough  and  dyspnoea  while  for  docetaxel 
most  commonly  reported  AEs  were  haematological  toxicity,  neurotoxicity,  myalgia,  asthenic 
conditions, and alopecia. Overall, the AEs reported in the V-15-32 and SIGN studies were the same as 
for the INTEREST study. In the dose-finding studies, IDEAL I and II and the ISEL study, the most 
common AEs seen were consistent with INTEREST study. Some AEs, most notably diarrhoea, rash, 
acne,  and  dry  skin,  occurred  more  frequently  in  patients  receiving  gefitinib  500  mg  than  patients 
receiving 250 mg.  In the pooled dataset from the ISEL, INTEREST and IPASS phase III clinical trials 
(2462  gefitinib-treated  patients),  the  most  frequently  reported  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs), 
occurring in more than 20 % of the patients, are diarrhoea and skin reactions (including rash, acne, dry 
skin and pruritus). ADRs usually occur within the first month of therapy and are generally reversible. 
Approximately  8 %  of  patients  had  a  severe  ADR  (common  toxicity  criteria,  (CTC)  grade  3  or  4). 
Approximately  3 %  of  patients  stopped  therapy  due  to  an  ADR.    Interstitial  lung  disease  (ILD)  has 
occurred  in  1.3 %  of  patients,  often  severe  (CTC  grade  3-4).  Cases  with  fatal  outcomes  have  been 
reported.  
Generally,  most  of  the  reported  AEs  for  gefitinib  were  CTC  grade  1  or  2.  The  reported  rash  and 
diarrhoea as CTC grade 3 or 4 AEs were at a low frequency, 1.6% and 2.5%, and 1.1%, and 2.8%, in 
the  INTEREST  and  ISEL  studies,  respectively.  The  frequency  of  patients  with  CTC  grade  3  and  4 
increased with the gefitinib dose. The incidences of SAEs and treatment related SAEs were higher for 
docetaxel than for gefitinib. Across the studies, the most commonly reported gefitinib related SAE was 
diarrhoea, with a frequency of ≤2%. Furthermore, the incidences of gefitinib related SAEs leading to 
death were ≤ 0.8%. In V-15-32, the most frequently reported SAE in gefitinib treated patients was ILD 
which is known to be more common in the Japanese population. In the INTEREST trial, the incidence 
of ILD type events was 1.4 % (10) patients in the gefitinib group vs. 1.1 % (8) patients in the docetaxel 
group.  One ILD-type event was fatal, and this occurred in a patient receiving gefitinib.  
In the ISEL trial, the incidence of ILD-type events in the overall population was approximately 1 % in 
both treatment arms. The majority of ILD-type events reported was from patients of Asian ethnicity 
and the ILD incidence among patients of Asian ethnicity receiving gefitinib therapy and placebo was 
approximately 3 % and 4 % respectively. One ILD-type event was fatal, and this occurred in a patient 
receiving placebo. 
In a post-marketing surveillance study in Japan (3350 patients) the reported rate of ILD-type events in 
patients receiving  gefitinib  was  5.8 %. The proportion  of  ILD-type  events  with  a  fatal outcome  was 
38.6 %. 
In  a  phase  III  open-label  clinical  trial  (IPASS)  in  1217  patients  comparing  gefitinib  to 
carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment in selected patients with advanced 
NSCLC  in  Asia,  the  incidence  of  ILD-type  events  was  2.6 %  on  the  gefitinib  treatment  arm  versus 
1.4 % on the carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment arm. 
Overall, in the INTEREST study discontinuation due to AEs was less frequent in the gefitinib treated 
patients compared to the docetaxel treated patients. Discontinuation due to AEs was higher for patients 
receiving  gefitinib  than  for  patients  receiving  placebo  (5.4%  vs  2.3%  in  the  ISEL  study).  The  most 
common  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  included  diarrhoea,  skin  events,  gastrointestinal  events  and 
ILD. The incidence of ILD-type events with gefitinib in the Japanese studies was higher than that in 
the Caucasian populations (4-6% vs 1%).  
Assessment  of  the  adverse  event  profile  of  gefitinib  in  special  populations  does  not  raise  safety 
concerns based on gender, racial origin, age, body mass index, performance status, smoking status, or 
tumour histology.  Gefitinib was generally well tolerated in all patient populations assessed.  Toxicity 
with respect to EGFR M+ and EGFR M- status was not analysed.

There  were  no  clinically  relevant  ECG  abnormalities  or  any  suggestion  of  arrhythmogenic  potential 
across  the  gefitinib  study  programme.  Among  the  ophthalmological  AEs  observed,  conjunctivitis, 
blepharitis,  corneal  erosion  and  dry  eyes  were  the  most  common.  Furthermore,  the  studies  did  not 
reveal  any  clinically  relevant  differences  between  gefitinib  treated  and  either  docetaxel  or  placebo 
treated patients in terms of renal disorders (e.g., renal failure) or hepatic dysfunction other than mild to 
moderate elevations in transaminases. For Japanese patients there seemed to be a higher incidence of 
abnormal hepatic function.  
In  patients  with  mild  or  moderate renal impairment  at  baseline,  AE  in  gefitinib treated  patients  was 
similar to patients with normal renal function at study entry. The number of patients with severe renal 
impairment was too small to evaluate the safety profile of gefitinib in this population of patients. In 
patients  with  hepatic  impairment  due  to  cirrhosis,  a  3.1-fold  increase  in  exposure  to  gefitinib  was 
shown. This increase in exposure may be of clinical relevance since adverse experiences are related to 
dose and exposure to gefitinib. However, patients with hepatic impairment due to liver metastases did 
not  show  an  apparent  increase  in  exposure  to  gefitinib  and  frequency  and  severity  of  AEs.  In  the 
INTEREST study, no specific safety concerns were identified for patients who received gefitinib and 
had concurrent diabetes mellitus, COPD or hypertension. 
There  was  no  association  of  gefitinib  with  haematological  toxicity.  However,  increases  in  liver 
transaminases  and  a  slightly  greater  incidence  of  increased  creatinine  were  observed  for  patients 
treated with gefitinib compared to placebo and docetaxel. Furthermore, there was a slightly increased 
frequency of haematuria and, to a lesser extent, proteinuria, among gefitinib treated patients compared 
to patients treated with docetaxel or placebo. 
There  are  no  data  from  the  use  of  gefitinib  in  pregnant  women.  Studies  in  animals  have  shown 
reproductive  toxicity  (see  SmPC  section  5.3).  The  potential  risk  for  humans  is  unknown.    Gefitinib 
should  not  be used during  pregnancy  unless clearly  necessary,  and  women  of  childbearing  potential 
must be advised not to get pregnant during therapy. 
It  is  not  known  whether  gefitinib  is  secreted  in  human  milk.    Gefitinib  and  metabolites  of  gefitinib 
accumulated  in  milk  of  lactating  rats  (see  SmPC  section  5.3).    Gefitinib  is  contraindicated  during 
breast-feeding and therefore breast-feeding must be discontinued while receiving gefitinib therapy (see 
SmPC section 4.3). 
There were several drug-drug interactions that might affect the safety of gefitinib administration. The 
metabolism  of  gefitinib  is  via  the  cytochrome  P450  isoenzyme  CYP3A4  (predominantly)  and  via 
CYP2D6.  Substances  that  inhibit  CYP3A4  may  decrease  the  clearance  of  gefitinib.    Concomitant 
administration  with  potent  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  activity  (e.g.  ketoconazole,  posaconazole, 
voriconazole,  protease  inhibitors,  clarithromycin,  telithromycin)  may  increase  gefitinib  plasma 
concentrations.  The increase may be clinically relevant since adverse reactions are related to dose and 
exposure.    The  increase  might  be  higher  in  individual  patients  with  CYP2D6  poor  metaboliser 
genotype.  Pre-treatment with itraconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) resulted in an 80 % increase 
in the mean AUC of gefitinib in healthy volunteers. In situations of concomitant treatment with potent 
inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  the  patient  should  be  closely  monitored  for  gefitinib  adverse  reactions.  An 
interaction between gefitinib and rifampicin, a potent inducers of CYP3A4, was shown in a clinical 
interaction  study  (0030).  The  concomitant  use  of  gefitinib  and  rifampicin  resulted  in  decreased 
gefitinib  exposure  and  a  potential  decrease  in  gefitinib  plasma  concentrations.  Substances  that  are 
inducers of CYP3A4 activity may increase metabolism and decrease gefitinib plasma concentrations 
and  thereby  reduce  the  efficacy  of  gefitinib.  Concomitant  medicinal  products  that  induce  CYP3A4 
(e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, barbiturates or St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)), 
should  be  avoided.  Pre-treatment  with  rifampicin  (a  potent  CYP3A4  inducer)  in  healthy  volunteers 
reduced mean gefitinib AUC by 83 % (see SmPC section 4.4). In poor metabolisers for CYP2D6, it 
would  be  expected  that  strong  CYP2D6  inhibitors  (e.g.  fluoxetine  and  paroxetine)  will  increase 
exposure  to  gefitinib  by  2-fold.  There  are  no  data  on  concomitant  treatment  with  an  inhibitor  of 
CYP2D6 but potent inhibitors of this enzyme might cause increased plasma concentrations of gefitinib 
in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers by about 2-fold (see SmPC section 5.2). If concomitant treatment 
with  a  potent  CYP2D6  inhibitor  is  initiated,  the  patient  should  be  closely  monitored  for  adverse 
Page 77 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
reactions.  In  vitro  studies  have  shown  that  gefitinib  has  limited  potential  to  inhibit  CYP2D6.  In  a 
clinical  trial  in  patients,  gefitinib  was  co-administered  with  metoprolol  (a  CYP2D6  substrate).  This 
resulted in a 35 % increase in exposure to metoprolol. Such an increase might potentially be relevant 
for  CYP2D6  substrates  with  narrow  therapeutic  index.  When  the  use  of  CYP2D6  substrates  are 
considered  in  combination  with  gefitinib,  a  dose  modification  of  the  CYP2D6  substrate  should  be 
considered especially for products with a narrow therapeutic window (see SmPC section 4.5). 
The  effect  of  food  and  the  effect  of  increased  gastric  pH  (≥5)  showed  that  food  had  increased 
bioavailability of gefitinib by 37%. And sustained elevation of gastric pH (using 2x450mg ranitidine) 
resulted  in  47%  decreased  bioavailability  of  gefitinib.  Substances  that  cause  significant  sustained 
elevation in gastric pH may reduce gefitinib plasma concentrations and thereby reduce the efficacy of 
gefitinib.  High doses of short-acting antacids may have a similar effect if taken regularly close in time 
to administration of gefitinib.  Concomitant administration of gefitinib with ranitidine at a dose that 
caused  sustained elevations  in  gastric  pH  ≥5,  resulted  in  a reduced  mean  gefitinib  AUC  by  47 % in 
healthy volunteers (see SmPC section 4.4 and 5.2). 
Gefitinib inhibits the transporter protein BCRP in vitro, but the clinical relevance of this finding is 
unknown. 
INR elevations and/or bleeding events have been reported in some patients concomitantly taking 
warfarin (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice immediately if they experience: 
• 
• 
any eye symptoms. 
severe or persistent diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting or anorexia as these may indirectly lead to 
dehydration. 
These symptoms should be managed as clinically indicated (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Gefitinib  has  no  or  negligible  influence  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines.  However,  during 
treatment with gefitinib, asthenia has been reported. Therefore, patients who experience this symptom 
should be cautious when driving or using machines. 
There  is  no  specific  treatment  in  the  event  of  overdose  of  gefitinib,  and  possible  symptoms  of 
overdose  are  not  established.  However,  in  phase  I  clinical  trials,  a  limited  number  of  patients  were 
treated  with  daily  doses  of  up  to  1000 mg.  An  increase  of  frequency  and  severity  of  some  adverse 
reactions was observed, mainly diarrhoea and skin rash. Adverse reactions associated with overdose 
should be treated symptomatically; in particular severe diarrhoea should be managed appropriately. 
Therefore, the overall safety profile for gefitinib in the proposed dose for marketing was considered 
acceptable and relatively well tolerated.

Warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC states that ILD may be acute in 
onset, has been observed in 1.3% of patients receiving IRESSA, and 
that some cases have been fatal. Advises interrupting IRESSA and 
initiating prompt investigation if patients experience worsening of 
respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough and fever. If ILD is 
confirmed, IRESSA should be discontinued and the patient treated 
appropriately. 
Risk factors for development of ILD (irrespective of treatment)  
include smoking, poor performance status (PS≥ 2), CT scan evidence 
of reduced normal lung (≤ 50%), recent diagnosis of NSCLC (< 6 
months), pre-existing ILD, older age (≥ 55 years old) and concurrent 
cardiac disease.  An increased risk of ILD on gefitinib relative to 
chemotherapy was seen predominantly during the first 4 weeks of 
treatment.  Risk of mortality with ILD is higher in patients with the 
following risk factors: smoking, CT scan evidence of reduced normal 
lung (≤ 50%), pre-existing ILD, older age (≥ 65 years old), and 
extensive areas adherent to pleura (≥ 50%).

Although liver function test abnormalities (including increases in 
alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin) were 
common, they were rarely observed as hepatitis (see section 4.8). 
Therefore, periodic liver function testing is recommended. IRESSA 
should be used cautiously in the presence of mild to moderate 
changes in liver function. Discontinuation should be considered if 
changes are severe. 
Hepatitis and increases in alanine aminotransferase, asparate 
aminotransferase and bilirubin are included in section 4.8 of the

Section 4.4 ‘Special warnings and special precautions for use’ of the 
SmPC states: 
CYP3A4 inducers may increase metabolism of gefitinib and decrease 
gefitinib plasma concentrations.  Therefore, concomitant 
administration of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
rifampicin, barbiturates or herbal preparations containing St John’s 
Wort/Hypericum perforatum) may reduce efficacy of the treatment 
and should be avoided, (see Section 4.5). 
In individual patients with CYP2D6 poor metaboliser genotype, 
treatment with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor might lead to increased 
plasma levels of gefitinib.  At initiation of treatment with a CYP3A4 
inhibitor, patients should be closely monitored for gefitinib adverse 
reactions (see section 4.5). 
International Normalised Ratio (INR) elevations and/or bleeding 
events have been reported in some patients taking warfarin together 
with gefitinib (see Section 4.5). Patients taking warfarin and gefitinib 
concomitantly should be monitored regularly for changes in 
Prothrombin Time (PT) or INR. 
Medicinal products that cause significant sustained elevation in 
gastric pH, such as proton-pump inhibitors and H2-antagonists may 
reduce bioavailability and plasma concentrations of gefitinib, and 
therefore, may reduce efficacy.  Antacids if taken regularly close in 
time to administration of gefitinib may have a similar effect (see 
sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Section 4.5 ‘Interaction with other medicinal products and other 
forms of interaction’ outlines the metabolism of gefitinib (via the 
cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 predominantly, and via 
CYP2D6), and discusses substances that affect the absorption or 
clearance of gefitinib, the limited potential of gefitinib to inhibit 
CYP2D6 in vitro, the in vitro inhibition of BCRP by gefitinib, and 
INR changes in some patients taking warfarin. 
Advice to monitor for adverse events in patients with known 
CYP2D6 poor metaboliser genotype included in section 4.2 of the

2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of the medicinal product IRESSA is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance 
with the conditions defined in the SmPC.  
Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical  performance  of  the  product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion there were no unresolved quality issues.   
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Gefitinib was shown in in vitro and in vivo studies to inhibit EGF-stimulated tumour cell growth and 
auto-phosphorylation  of  EGFR  in  a  number  of  human  tumour  cell  lines.  The  in  vivo  activity  of 
gefitinib was shown to completely block the growth of tumour xenographs at a daily oral dose of 200 
mg/kg of gefitinib. A lack of correlation between anti-tumour activity and EGFR expression was seen 
both in the animal models and in the clinic. 
Safety  pharmacology  studies  addressed  the  influence  of  gefitinib  on  respiratory,  CNS  and 
cardiovascular functions. The only safety concern was a potential for QT prolongation. Data from in 
vitro studies indicate that gefitinib has the potential to inhibit cardiac repolarization (e.g. QT interval). 
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to the 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were corneal epithelia atrophy and 
corneal  translucencies,  renal  papillary  necrosis,  hepatocellular  necrosis  and  eosinophilic  sinusoidal 
macrophage infiltration 
A  reduction  in  female  fertility  was  observed  in  the rat  at a  dose of  20 mg/kg/day.  Published  studies 
have  shown  that  genetically  modified  mice,  lacking  expression  of  EGFR,  exhibit  developmental 
defects, related to epithelial immaturity in a variety of organs including the skin, gastrointestinal tract 
Page 82 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and  lung.  When  gefitinib  was  administered  to  rats  during  organogenesis,  there  were  no  effects  on 
embryofoetal  development  at  the  highest  dose  (30 mg/kg/day).  However,  in  the  rabbit,  there  were 
reduced foetal weights at 20 mg/kg/day and above. There were no compound-induced malformations 
in  either  species.  When  administered  to  the  rat  throughout  gestation  and  parturition,  there  was  a 
reduction in pup survival at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day. 
Following  oral  administration  of  C-14  labelled  gefitinib  to  lactating  rats  14  days  post  partum, 
concentrations of radioactivity in milk were 11-19 fold higher than in blood. 
Gefitinib showed no genotoxic potential. A 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats resulted in a small but 
statistically significant increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in both male and female rats 
and mesenteric lymph node haemangiosarcomas in female rats at the highest dose (10mg/kg/day) only. 
The  hepatocellular  adenomas  were  also  seen  in  a  2-year  carcinogenicity  study  in  mice,  which 
demonstrated a small increased incidence of this finding in male mice  at the mid dose, and in both 
male and female mice at the highest dose. The effects reached statistical significance for the female 
mice, but not for the males.  At no-effect levels in both mice and rats there was no margin in clinical 
exposure.  The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 
The  results  of  an  in  vitro  phototoxicity  study  demonstrated  that  gefitinib  may  have  phototoxicity 
potential. 
Efficacy 
In support of the indication, the applicant submitted three pivotal trials (IPASS, INTEREST and ISEL) 
and  3  additional  supportive  studies  (v-15-32,SIGN  and  ISTANA).  The  INTEREST  trial  was  a 
randomised,  open  label,  multicentre,  Phase  III  double  arm  trial,  comparing  once-daily  oral  gefitinib 
250  mg  with  3-weekly  intravenous  docetaxel  75  mg/m2  in  1466  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic NSCLC who had previously received platinum-based chemotherapy and were eligible for 
further  chemotherapy  (second  or  thirdline  therapy).    The  primary  endpoint  was  OS.  The  trial  was 
designed  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  in  terms  OS  of  gefitinib  to  docetaxel  and  superiority  of 
gefitinib in the EGFR FISH+ patients, the co-primary analysis evaluating EGFR gene copy number as 
measured  by  fluorescence  in  situ  hybridisation  (FISH).  The  median  OS  was  7.6  versus  8.0  months 
(HR 1.020; 96%CI 0.905-1.150) for gefitinib and docetaxel-treated patients, respectively. The primary 
unadjusted analysis had a confidence interval upper limit of 1.150 which was very close to the pre-
specified 1.154 non-inferiority limit. However, the secondary adjusted analysis did not meet the pre-
specified limit of 1.154 and the upper limit of 1.178 would correspond to an estimated possible median 
difference of 1.2 months in favour of docetaxel.  In the EGFR FISH+ population, the median overall 
survival  was  8.4  versus  7.5  months  for  gefitinib  and  docetaxel  treated  patients,  respectively  (HR 
1.087;  95%CI  0.782-1.510;  p=0.6199)  and  the  PFS  and  ORR  was  comparable  in  both  treatment 
groups. In the EGFR M+ status patients, no differences in OS were observed but, notably, the ORR 
were  42.1%  and  21.1%  (OR  25.2;  95%CI  1.23-515.53;  p=0.036)  for  gefitinib  and  docetaxel, 
respectively, and PFS had a HR 0.16 in favour of docetaxel. A subgroup analysis for the non-Asian 
population was performed and demonstrated consistent results with the overall patient population. 
There  were  two  placebo  controlled,  add-on  studies  to  BSC  that  were  submitted  as  part  of  the 
application. The ISEL study, a last-line study in patients not suitable for further chemotherapy and the 
INSTEP study, a first line study in patients not considered suitable for chemotherapy. In both of these 
studies, patients with FISH- tumours benefited less from treatment with gefitinib. In the ISEL study, 
the  point  estimates  for  survival  and  time  to  treatment  failure  actually  indicated  that  benefit  was 
confined  to  patients  with  FISH+  tumours.  Of  importance  in  the  interpretation  of  study  data  is  the 
overlap  between  FISH  positivity  and  activating  mutations.  The  IPASS  study  was  the  first  study  to 
demonstrate that the gefitinib activity in EGFR FISH+ but EGFR M- tumours was low, indicating that 
EGFR FISH status was not predictive of response of tumours for gefitinib.  
The  IPASS  was  a  randomised,  open  label,  multicentre,  Phase  III  double  arm  trial,  comparing  once-
daily oral gefitinib 250 mg with carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy (paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 
iv  over  3  hours  followed  by  carboplatin  AUC  5.0  or 6.0  iv  over  15  minutes  to 60  minutes, every  3 
weeks, for a total of 6 cycles) in selected Asian patients with advanced NSCLC in first line therapy.

The  trial  recruited  1217  patients  exclusively  in  Asia  with  adenocarcinoma  histology,  which  had  not 
smoked or were ex-light smokers. This was an enriched Asian patient population who had biological 
factors  that  had  been  previously  identified  in  the  ISEL  and  IDEAL  studies  as  conferring  greater 
clinical benefit derived from gefitinib treatment. The ISEL study had identified a subgroup of patients 
who were never smokers and of Asian origin which benefited the most and the two Phase II studies 
IDEAL  I  and  II  had  identified  patients  with  adenocarcinoma  who  had  a  high  rate  of  response  to 
gefitinib.    The  trial  met  its  primary  endpoint  in  the  overall  population  where  PFS  was  considered 
improved  in  the  gefitinib  arm  compared  to  the  doublet  chemotherapy  [HR  0.74;  95%CI  0.65-0.85; 
p<0.0001] where the risk of progression was reduced by 26%. Analysis of PFS by biomarker status 
showed a strong association between EGFR mutation status and PFS. In patients who were EGFR M+, 
PFS  was  significantly  longer  in  the  gefitinib  arm  compared  to  the  doublet  chemotherapy  (HR  0.48; 
95%CI 0.36-0.64; p<0.0001). In patients who were EGFR M-, PFS was significantly shorter than with 
the doublet chemotherapy (HR 2.85; 95%CI 2.05-3.98, p<0.0001). The ORR was 71.2% and 47.3% in 
EGFR  M+  patients  and  1.1%  and  23.5%  for  EGFR  M-  patients,  for  gefitinib  and  doublet 
chemotherapy,  respectively.  Post-hoc  analyses  of  OS  according  to  EGFR  mutation  status  was  more 
favourable in patients that are EGFR M+ and treated with gefitinib rather than doublet chemotherapy.  
Therefore, these results confirmed the finding that patients that receive greatest benefit from gefitinib 
treatment are patients with the activating mutation of EGFR. 
Safety 
There  were  fewer  grades  3  to  5  AE  in  the  gefitinib  arm  (31.6%  compared  to  62.5%  in  the  doublet 
chemotherapy) and fewer AE leading to discontinuation (6.9% compared to 13.6%). Treatment related 
deaths  were  similar  for  both  arms  (0.7%  for  gefitinib  and  0.5%  for  doublet  chemotherapy).  ILD 
adverse events were reported in both arms with slightly higher frequency in the gefitinib arm (2.6%) 
than in the doublet chemotherapy (1.4%).   
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics 
Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these concerns

Risk-benefit assessment 
The  IPASS  study  provided  the  opportunity  to  evaluate,  in  a  selected  Asian  patient  population,  the 
EGFR status in tumours and test the hypothesis for activity of gefitinib against this pre-defined genetic 
marker in a first line treatment. In EGFR mutation positive patients, gefitinib was associated with an 
increase  of  ORR  by  23.9%  (95%  CI:  [12.0 %,  34.9 %])  and  a  HR  for  PFS  of  0.48  (95%  CI:  [0.36, 
0.64],  p<0.0001,  median  9.5 months  vs  6.3 months  for  gefitinib  vs  chemotherapy).  The  results  were 
consistent  across  trials  for  ORR.  ORR  was  influenced  to  a  certain  extent  by  line  of  therapy  and  by 
ethnicity,  where  response  rate  in  the  non-Asian  population  was  lower  than  Asian  population.  The 
CHMP  acknowledged  that  this  could  be  due  to  the  prevalence  of  the  EGFR  mutation  in  the  Asian 
population and/or the test that was used to analyse mutation status. These results were supported by 
exploratory  analyses  from  the  INTEREST  trial,  where  an  effect  in  terms  of  PFS  and  ORR  was 
observed in patients with EGFR M+ tumours but not EGFR M- tumours. Comparable results were also 
observed in never-smoking patients. Therefore, the CHMP noted that the data presented support the 
therapeutic indication and patients who derive the most benefit from gefitinib are patients that harbour 
an EGFR activating mutation. 
The CHMP expressed some concern over the OS data in the full study population in the INTEREST 
trial where a difference of up to 1.2 months in favour of docetaxel could not be convincingly ruled out. 
However,  the  CHMP  considered  that  any  possible  differences  in  efficacy  between  gefitinib  and 
docetaxel  are  likely  to  be  marginal  in  the  restricted  indication.  The  estimated  treatment  effect  of 
Page 84 of 86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gefitinib compared to docetaxel in the 2nd/3rd line treatment in EGFR+ patients in terms of PFS are: 
HR  0.16  95%CI  [0.05,  0.49],  median  PFS  7  months  vs  4.1  months  for  gefitinib  and  docetaxel, 
respectively. For OS, the treatment effects are: HR 0.83 95%CI [0.41, 1.67], median OS 14.2 months 
vs 16.6 months for gefitinib and docetaxel, respectively. Thus from the limited data presented, there 
seems to be minor benefit in terms of OS.  The results may have to some extent been confounded by 
cross-over.  The  estimated  treatment  effect  of  gefitinib  in  the  ISEL  study,  a  last  line  treatment, 
compared to placebo in EGFR+ patients in terms of PFS are: HR not calculated, due to insufficient 
events, median PFS 10.8 months vs 3.8 months for gefitinib and placebo, respectively. These results 
were supported by ORR data and data in never-smokers.   
The applicant, at an oral explanation, presented further data claiming that EGFR M+ was an overall 
predictive  factor  for  response  rate  and  efficacy  in  patients  treated  with  gefitinib  and  never-smoking 
could  be  used as  a  surrogate  marker  for  EGFR  M+  status  as  40%  of  never-  smokers  were found to 
have  EGFR  activating  mutations.  In  the  INSTEP  study,  the  patient  benefit  seemed  to  be  related  to 
never-smoking status.  
There are no clinical or pharmacodynamic data to compare directly the clinical efficacy and safety of 
gefitinib versus erlotinib in patients with EGFR M+ tumours. Therefore, whether or not there are any 
relevant  differences  between  gefitinib  and  erlotinib  in  terms  of  activity  in  patients  with  EGFR  M+ 
tumours  is  unknown.  No  clinically  relevant  activity  has  been  shown  in  patients  with  known  EGFR 
mutation-negative tumours. Gefitinib should not be used in patients with tumours known to be EGFR 
M-. 
The  CHMP  also  had  concerns  over  the  extrapolation  of  the  IPASS  data  and  INTEREST  data  for  a 
Caucasian population. The conclusion of efficacy of gefitinib in EGFR+ patients is mainly based on 
the results of the IPASS study as the number of EGFR+ patients in INTEREST and ISEL was rather 
limited.  The  CHMP  members  expressed  different  positions  with  regards  to  the  limited  data  in  the 
INTEREST  and  ISEL  study  and  extrapolation  of  the  Asian  population  in  the  IPASS  study  to  a 
Caucasian population. The applicant provided subgroup analysis based to patients characteristics and 
risk  factors  which  showed  that  the  data  in  the  overall  population  in  the  INTEREST  trial  could  be 
extrapolated to the Caucasian population. The applicant described further subgroup analyses across the 
trials  included  in the  application  and literature references  to  support the  indication  in the  Caucasian 
population.  The CHMP accepted the relevance of EGFR mutations on the efficacy data in gefitinib-
treated  patients  in  relation  to  the  indication.  The  CHMP  noted  that  although  the  INTEREST  trial 
showed efficacy in the Caucasian population comparable to the overall population studies, there was 
still  a  need  to  confirm  the  efficacy  of  gefitinib  in  the  selected  population  with  EGFR  M+  tumours 
conducted in a prospective study in a Caucasian population. The issue over extrapolation of data to the 
Caucasian population was resolved by the applicant’s commitment to submit data from a trial designed 
to  assess  tumour  response  in  selected  patients  for  EGFR  mutation  conducted  in  a  Caucasian 
population.    The  applicant  has  committed  to  further  discuss  the  appropriate  trial  design  for  the 
Caucasian population.  
Tumours with co-mutations (KRAS and EGFR) are uncommon and thus, at this time the CHMP is of 
the opinion that there are no major concerns regarding the status of KRAS mutation. 
The CHMP noted the well characterised safety profile and better tolerability of gefitinib as compared 
to  chemotherapeutic  agents  (docetaxel,  carboplatin/paclitaxel)  used  for  treatment  of  NSCLC.  The 
main AE for gefitinib were gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea) and skin and subcutaneous disorders 
(rash,  dry  skin  and  pruritis).  The  CHMP  noted  that  there  was  an  increased  risk  for  interstitial  lung 
disorders (ILD), both in Asian and in Caucasian patients treated with gefitinib and that the outcome 
was fatal in about 1 in every 3 affected. However, the CHMP considered the risk of ILD to be minimal 
with respect with the overall safety profile of gefitinib. The CHMP noted the improved QoL data in 
favour of gefitinib as shown in the IPASS (open label).  
In light of the overall positive results from the well conducted and appropriately designed pivotal trials 
and supportive data from other trials and the views of the SAG Oncology, the CHMP supported the

recommendation of the restricted therapeutic indication in patients with tumours harbouring activating 
EGFR mutations.  
Treatment with gefitinib should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer therapies. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131)  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
(cid:131)  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  IRESSA  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations of EGFR-TK 
(see  SPC  section  5.1)  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing 
authorisation.

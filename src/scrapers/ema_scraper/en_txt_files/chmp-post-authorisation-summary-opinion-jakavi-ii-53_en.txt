Jakavi 
ruxolitinib 
On 24 March 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Jakavi. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Novartis Europharm Limited. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication for graft versus host disease (GvHD). 
The full indications for Jakavi will therefore be as follows:2  
Myelofibrosis (MF) 
Jakavi is indicated for the treatment of disease related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult 
patients with primary myelofibrosis (also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post 
polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. 
Polycythaemia vera (PV) 
Jakavi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with polycythaemia vera who are resistant 
to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. 
Graft versus host disease (GvHD) 
Jakavi is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with acute 
graft versus host disease or chronic graft versus host disease who have inadequate 
response to corticosteroids or other systemic therapies (see section 5.1). 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

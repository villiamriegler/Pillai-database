Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for sofosbuvir, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Regarding the risk of bradycardia, further analyses indicated that this risk can occur when sofosbuvir is 
given with another direct-acting antiviral and amiodarone. In particular, interaction between sofosbuvir 
+ simeprevir and amiodarone has also been identified. Since the existing wording restricted the warning 
only to the use of sofosbuvir + daclatasvir and amiodarone, it became outdated and had to be modified.  
Furthermore, patients who also take other medications known to cause bradycardia or those with 
underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease were considered to be potentially at 
increased risk of symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone, based on 
post-marketing reports. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR(s), the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal product(s) containing sofosbuvir were warranted. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for sofosbuvir the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing sofosbuvir is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

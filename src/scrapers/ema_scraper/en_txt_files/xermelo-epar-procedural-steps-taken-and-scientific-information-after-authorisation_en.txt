1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Xermelo in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing

impairment and in healthy subjects. At a single dose of 250

evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 
Telotristat Ethyl in Male and Female Subjects with 
Severe Hepatic Impairment and Matched Subjects

mg, exposure to the parent compound was increased 
317.0% and 529.5% for AUCt and Cmax, respectively, and 
to the active metabolite (AUCt, AUCinf, and Cmax) 497%, 
500%, and 217%, respectively, for subjects with severe 
hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal 
hepatic function. In addition, the half-life of the active 
metabolite was increased, i.e. the mean half life was 16.0 
hours in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared 
to 5.47 hours in healthy subjects. Based on these findings, 
the use of telotristat etiprate is not recommended in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score 
C).

To update sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC to 
update the information on the interaction with 
Carboxylesterases 2 inhibitors based on final results 
from the non-clinical study IPS000610; the Package

Concomitant use of Xermelo may change the exposure of 
medicinal products that are Carboxylesterase 2 substrates 
(e.g. prasugrel, irinotecan, capecitabine and flutamide). If 
co-administration is unavoidable, treatment should be 
monitored for suboptimal efficacy and safety events.

In vitro telotristat ethyl engages in an allosteric interaction 
with CYP3A4 resulting at the same time in a reduced 
conversion of midazolam to 1’-OH-MDZ, and increased 
conversion to 4-OH-MDZ. The IC50 of the inhibition of 
loperamide on the metabolism of telotristat ethyl by 
Carboxylesterase 2 was 5.2 µM. In vitro, telotristat ethyl 
inhibited Carboxylesterase 2 with an IC50 approximately of 
0.56 μM.

The long-term safety and tolerability of telotristat was 
results from study LX1606.1-302.CS (TELEPATH) 
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP; this is a 
multicentre, phase III, long-term extension study to 
further evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
telotristat etiprate in patients with carcinoid 
syndrome (CS). The updated RMP version 4.0 has 
also been submitted, also updating to GVP Module V 
(Rev 2).

Patients having participated in any Xermelo phase 2 or 
phase 3 carcinoid syndrome study were eligible to enter the 
study at the same dose level and regimen as identified in 
their original study, for at least 84 weeks of treatment. No 
new significant safety signals were identified.  
The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate 
changes in patients’ quality of life (QOL) through Week 84. 
QOL was generally stable over the course of the study.

No change in dosage is required in patients with mild,

information in relation to renal impairment based on 
study D-FR-01017-002 (A Phase I, open-label study

function to healthy subjects with normal renal

moderate or severe renal impairment who are not requiring 
dialysis. As a precautionary measure, it is recommended 
that patients with severe renal impairment will be 
monitored for signs of reduced tolerability. 
The use of Xermelo is not recommended in patients with 
end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (eGFR < 15 
mL/min requiring dialysis) because efficacy and safety of 
Xermelo in these patients has not been established.

hippurate salt of telotristat ethyl) with acid-reducers 
(omeprazole and famotidine) showed that the AUC of 
telotristat ethyl was increased 2-3 fold, while the AUC of 
the active metabolite (telotristat) was not changed. Since 
telotristat ethyl is rapidly converted to its active metabolite, 
which is > 25× more active than telotristat ethyl, no dose 
adjustments are required when using Xermelo with acid 
reducers.

corresponding to an exposure of approximately 10- to 15-
fold and 2- to 4.5-fold the human exposure to the active 
metabolite at the MRHD in mice and rats, respectively.

With regards to the efficacy, the updated results from the 
Submission of the final report from studies LX301 
(pivotal phase III study) and LX303 (supportive 
phase III study) two randomised, multicentre, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies listed as 
category 3 studies in the RMP. The objective of study 
LX301 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
telotristat etriprate in patients with carcinoid 
syndrome not adequately controlled by Somatostatin 
Analog (SSA) therapy; while the objective of study 
LX303 is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
telotristat etiprate in patients with carcinoid 
syndrome. In addition, the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder (MAH) took the opportunity to provide 
updated safety data from the long-term extension 
study LX302; a phase 3, multicentre, open-label 
study to further evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of telotristat. The RMP (version 3.0) was updated to 
reflect those safety data. 
The requested group of variations proposed 
amendments to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
open-label extensions of studies LX301 and LX303 are in 
line with the findings in the interim analyses provided 
during the marketing authorisation application and no 
changes to the previous efficacy assessments are required. 
With regards to the safety, the final analysis of the open-
label uncontrolled extensions of studies LX301 and LX303 
as well as the updated data from the ongoing uncontrolled 
study LX302 do not reveal new or unexpected safety 
findings. Overall, these results do not warrant any change 
to the Product Information of Xermelo.

Brief description of the product  Chemical class 
Recombinant Protein Vaccine 
Summary of mode of action 
SARS-CoV-2 virus recombinant spike (S) protein receptor binding 
domain (RBD) fusion heterodimer – B.1.351-B.1.1.7 variants, 
formulated in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution 
adjuvanted with SQBA adjuvant. The SQBA adjuvant facilitates 
activation of the cells of the innate immune system, which 
enhances the magnitude of the S protein RBD-specific immune 
response. The recombinant spike protein RBD domains of SARS-
CoV-2 are recognised by immune cells as a foreign antigen and 
elicit neutralising antibody and cellular responses which may 
contribute to protection against COVID-19. Neutralizing antibodies 
against the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 prevent RBD binding to its 
cellular target ACE2, thus blocking membrane fusion and viral 
infection. Moreover, BIMERVAX vaccine induces antigen-specific 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with a Th1 response. 
Important information about its composition  
One dose (0.5 mL) contains 40 µg of SARS-CoV-2 virus 
recombinant protein RBD (manufactured using a Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) suspension cell line stably transfected with a plasmid 
expressing the active substance antigen) in a phosphate-buffered 
(PBS) solution adjuvanted with 0.25 mL of SQBA. The SQBA 
adjuvant contains squalene as the internal oil phase, sodium 
citrate-citric acid buffer as the external aqueous phase and 
polysorbate 80 and sorbitan trioleate as emulsifiers.

Indication 
Active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older who have previously 
received a mRNA vaccine COVID-19 vaccine. BIMERVAX is administered intramuscularly as a single dose 
of  0.5 mL  at  least  6  months  after  a  previous  COVID-19  vaccine.  BIMERVAX  may  be  given  once  as  a 
booster dose to individuals 16 years of age and older who have received prior vaccination series with 
mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.  
Incidence and prevalence 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in patients with severe respiratory disease in 
Wuhan, China in December 2019. Afterwards, the COVID
19 epidemic has spread all over the world (Sun 
‐
et  al.,  2020).  The  causative  agent  was  a  novel  betacoronavirus  scientifically  named  severe  acute 
respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus  2  (SARS-CoV-2).  CoVs  members  belong  to  the  subfamily 
Coronovirinae  within  the  family  Coronaviridae  and  the  order  Nidovirales.  Based  on  their  protein 
sequences and phylogenetic relationships, members of the Coronavirinae subfamily can be classified into 
four groups, Alphacoronaviruses, Betacoronaviruses, Gammacoronaviruses, and Deltacoronaviruses. The 
CoVs  genome  is  a  single-stranded  positive-sense  RNA  (+ssRNA)  molecule.  The  genome  size  ranges 
between 27–32 kbp, one of the largest known RNA viruses (Alanagreh et al., 2020; Tegally et al., 2020). 
Angiotensin
converting  enzyme  2  (ACE2)  is  the  receptor  for  SARS
CoV
2.  In  the  normal  human  lung, 
ACE2 is expressed on type I and II alveolar epithelial cells. Among them, 83% of the type II alveolar 
‐
‐
‐
cells have ACE2 expression. The binding of SARS
CoV
2 on ACE2 causes an elevated expression of ACE2, 
which can lead to damages on alveolar cells. Damages to alveolar cells can, in turn, trigger a series of 
systemic reactions and even death (Zhao et al., 2020). 
‐
‐
The  incidence  and  prevalence  of  COVID-19  is  difficult  to  estimate  as  definitions  of  cases  may  have 
changed  since  the  onset  of  the  pandemic,  testing  availability  and  technology  has  changed,  as  have 
vaccination rates. In addition, there is the variable impact of different variants of concern (VoCs). As of 
17 May 2022, COVID-19, has become a pandemic with more than 521 million confirmed cases and more 
than 6.2 million deaths (World Health Organization, WHO (World Health Organization (WHO), 2021b)). 
In Europe, there have been more than 219 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 2 million 
deaths reported to WHO (Figure 1). During these months, several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have 
been  developed.  As  of  17  May  2022,  close  to  12.186  million  vaccine  doses  had  been  administered 
worldwide.

Figure 1. COVID-19 Cases Reported Weekly by WHO Region (top), and Global Deaths 
(bottom), as of 17 May 2022 (WHO (World Health Organization (WHO), 2021b)) 
In week 19 2022 (week ending Sunday, 15 May), in the EU/EEA overall, the reported weekly number of 
cases decreased by 11% compared to the previous week. Weekly increases were observed in Iceland 
and  Portugal.  The  countries  with  the  highest  14-day  notification  rates  per  100  000  population  were: 
Portugal  (2  286),  Luxembourg  (1  113),  Germany  (1  048),  Italy  (934)  and  France  (755).  Overall,  all 
countries except for Iceland and Portugal reported a decrease in the weekly  number of cases (ECDC, 
2022b).  
The 14-day case notification rate for the EU/EEA week 19, based on pooled data collected by ECDC from 
official national sources in 30 countries, was 606.7 per 100 000 population (country range: 17.4–2 286), 
compared  to  718.3  (country  range:  24.2–1  759)  in  week  18  (Figure  2).  This  pooled  rate  has  been 
decreasing  for  seven  weeks.  The  rate  per  100  000  population  was  <40  in  two  countries  (Poland  and 
Sweden), 40–<100 in five countries (Bulgaria, Czechia, Lithuania, Norway and Romania), 100–<300 in 
seven countries and 300 or higher in 16 countries. Increasing trends (duration in weeks) were observed 
in two countries - Iceland (one) and Portugal (four) (ECDC, 2022b).

Figure 2. EU/EEA 14-Day COVID-19 Case and Death Notification Rates (ECDC, 2022b) 
At the end of week 19 2022 (week ending Sunday, 15 May), overall transmission continues to decline in 
most countries, as shown by both overall case notification rates and case rates among people aged 65 
years and older. While decreasing overall, transmission in the 65 years and older age group is still high 
(50% of the pandemic maximum for the EU/EEA) and two countries reported recent increases among 
this age group. Whereas this could reflect targeted testing practices in some countries, it is still important 
to continue monitoring the disease burden in older age groups (ECDC, 2022b). 
Of  28  countries  with  data  on  hospital  or  ICU  admissions/occupancy  up  to  week  19,  four  reported  an 
increasing trend in at least one of these indicators compared with the previous week (Figure 3). The 14-
day  COVID-19  death  rate  has  been  decreasing  for  five  weeks  (14.4  deaths  per  million  population, 
compared with 18.1 deaths the previous week). Increasing trends in the COVID-19 death rate (duration 
in weeks) were observed in two countries (Bulgaria (one) and Portugal (one)), albeit death rates in this 
group are still low (8.7 and 5.8 % of pandemic maximum, respectively) (ECDC, 2022b).

Demographics of the population in the proposed indication and risk factors 
for COVID-19 in Europe 
All age groups can acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the first 3 months of the pandemic, the case 
notification  rate  was  significantly  higher  among  elderly  populations  however,  currently  the  age 
distribution  of  the  epidemic  curve  has  begun  to  change  because  of  vaccination  programmes,  with 
younger age groups (15-24 years old) now having the highest case notification rate, although cases of 
COVID-19 among individuals ≥ 65 years and older remain high. Figure 4 shows the case notification rates 
per 100,000 persons stratified by different age groups in the EU/EEA.

Figure 4. EU/EEA 14-Day Age-Specific COVID-19 Case Notification Rates (ECDC, 2022b) 
Age is a very important predictor of severe COVID-19. The risk of severe outcomes increases sharply 
with  increasing  age,  even  after  controlling  for  other  potential  confounding  factors,  including  sex  and 
underlying conditions (Bundle et al., 2021). 
Individuals  of  both  genders  can  acquire  SARS-CoV-2  infection.  Further  sex-disaggregated  data  for 
COVID-19 in several European countries show a similar number of cases between the sexes, but more 
severe outcomes in aged men. Case fatality is highest in men with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. 
The mechanisms accounting for the reduced case fatality rate in women are currently unclear (Gebhard 
et al., 2020). 
Important co-morbidities 
Data  pooled  from  31  European  countries  and  reported  to  The  European  Surveillance  System  (TESSy) 
have identified several underlying conditions that have a significant independent effect on severe COVID-
19 outcomes. Severe disease is defined as admission to a hospital/intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical 
ventilation,  or  death.  Severity  of  COVID-19  is  associated  with  increased  age,  pre-existing  medical 
conditions and the male sex. Underlying health conditions reported among adult patients with severe 
COVID-19  disease  include  diabetes,  obesity,  hypertension,  history  of  heart  failure,  ischaemic  heart 
disease,  solid  organ  tumours,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD),  chronic  respiratory 
disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer, neurological conditions, smoking, 
and pregnancy (ECDC, 2022d).

Risk Management Plan 
BIMERVAX 
Emulsion for injection 
With regards to mortality among hospitalised COVID-19 cases, high-certainty evidence in age- and sex-
adjusted analyses identified diabetes mellitus, renal disease and dementia as significant risk factors for 
mortality. Furthermore, there is moderate certainty evidence that ischaemic heart disease, stroke, solid 
organ tumours and obesity are also risk factors. Mortality among cases detected in the community setting 
is  associated  with  a  history  of  heart  failure,  stroke,  diabetes,  and  end-stage  renal  disease.  There  is 
moderate  to  high  certainty  evidence  of  an  association  between  hospitalisation  for  COVID-19  and 
diabetes,  heart  failure,  COPD,  renal  disease,  obesity,  and  ischaemic  heart  disease  in  the  community 
setting (ECDC, 2022d). 
Additionally,  age  is  also  an  important  effect  modifier  in  the  associations  between  certain  underlying 
conditions and severe COVID-19 outcomes. While some pre-existing medical conditions are known risk 
factors for severe disease and ICU admission in all age groups, including children and adolescents, it is 
still  not  fully  understood  how  these  pre-existing  conditions  influence  the  course  of  COVID-19.  The 
absolute probability of being hospitalised or dying increases with age, but findings indicate that a younger 
person  with  certain  underlying  conditions  may  have  the  same  or  even  a  higher  probability  of  severe 
outcome than an older person without these conditions. Based on the analysis of 820,404 symptomatic 
paediatric cases reported by 10 EU Member States between August 2020 and October 2021, there is an 
increased risk of severe outcomes in cases with comorbidities such as cancer, diabetes, cardiac or lung 
disease. However, most (83.7%) hospitalised children had no reported comorbidity (Bundle et al., 2021). 
This  is  relevant  for  age  and  risk-factor  based  prioritisation  of  vaccination,  particularly  among  young 
people (ECDC, 2022d). 
Vulnerable Groups 
Residents  of  long-term  care  facilities  are  a  medically  and  socially  vulnerable  group  because  of  their 
increased  age  and  the  prevalence  of  underlying  health  conditions.  Their  social  vulnerability  can  be 
exacerbated  by  non-pharmaceutical  interventions  against  COVID-19  that  limit  physical  personal 
interactions or affect access to health services, with consequences including feelings of abandonment 
and loneliness. All EU/EEA countries have experienced rapid increases in the incidence of outbreaks and 
fatal  cases  of  COVID-19  in  long-term  care  facilities.  Outbreaks  of  COVID-19  among  long-term  care 
facilities residents have commonly spread rapidly, with high attack rates and  high case fatality rates. 
This  has  been  fuelled  by  the  transmission  dynamics  of  COVID-19,  including  the  potential  for 
asymptomatic  transmission  among  and  between  staff  and  residents.  Factors  that  have  hampered the 
response  to  COVID-19  in  long-term  care  facilities  have  included  insufficient  availability  of  personal 
protective  equipment  and  of  human  resources;  insufficient  training  in  IPC,  including  use  of  personal 
protective  equipment  and  case  management,  and  reduced  access  to  essential  healthcare  services  
(ECDC, 2022d). 
The main existing treatment options 
Approaches  to  dealing  with  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  can  be  divided  into  two  main 
approaches:  (i)  preventative  measures  designed  to  reduce  transmission  and/or  severity  by  providing 
active immunity to infection and (ii) direct treatment measures to address the symptomology.

Preventative measures designed to reduce transmission and/or severity by providing active 
immunity to infection 
During the 2021 European summer season, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 declined in almost all EU/EEA 
countries and was at the lowest rate since September 2020. Some of the decline in SARS-CoV-2 incidence 
that  has  occurred  since  January  2021,  combined  with  reductions  in  hospitalisations  and  deaths, 
particularly in older age groups, is attributed to COVID19 vaccines.  
At the data lock point (DLP) of this risk management plan (RMP), seven vaccines have received approval 
by  EMA  (Table  1):  Comirnaty  (mRNA),  Spikevax  (mRNA),  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen  (adenovirus), 
Vaxzevria (adenovirus), Nuvaxovid (recombinant protein, adjuvanted),  COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva and 
VidPrevtyn Beta (recombinant protein, adjuvanted). Other 2 vaccines are currently under rolling review 
by the EMA.

Importantly, recent evidence suggests that vaccine efficacy may wane over time (Gupta et al., 2021; 
Keehner et al., 2021; Naaber et al., 2021; Thomas et al., 2021) which may lead to a decline in immunity, 
which may occur at the level of the individual or at the population level, increasing the risk of serious 
disease, especially in vulnerable populations, as well as favouring the rise of breakthrough infections and 
the emergence of new VoCs (Dolgin, 2021; Juno et al., 2021). This has led to the proposal for a third 
“booster”  dose  for  several  of  the  approved  vaccines  as  several  studies  supported  the  safety  and 
immunogenicity of a booster dose (Albach et al., 2021; Bar-On et al., 2021; Barda et al., 2021; Mahase, 
2021) (Figure 5). Initially a third dose was approved for the most vulnerable populations, but this has 
now been expanded to include all eligible adult individuals. In addition to this, several additional clinical 
studies  have  assessed  heterologous  vaccine  approaches  (i.e.,  mixing  different  vaccine  brands  or 
technology  platforms  in  the  primary  sequence  and/or  as  a  booster  to  a  different  primary  sequence) 
(Atmar et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Nordstrom et al., 2021; Sablerolles et al., 2021).  
Figure 5. Vaccine effectiveness over time (Gupta et al., 2021) 
Two doses of messenger RNA (mRNA) or adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines elicit high levels of protection from 
symptomatic disease, but this wanes over time. Emerging studies show that a third dose (booster) of the same type 
can restore effectiveness to >90%. Data are averages for Delta variant from multiple studies 
All  EU/EEA  countries  offer  vaccination  to  those  aged  12  years  and  over  and  23  countries  (of  the  26 
countries who responded) are offering to all children 5−11 years.  
As  of  10  April  2022  (week  14,  2022),  over  1.2  billion  vaccine  doses  have  been  administered  in  the 
EU/EEA, 328 million people have received a complete primary vaccination course and over 239 million 
individuals in the EU/EEA have already received a vaccine dose in addition to the primary course (this 
includes both booster doses and additional primary doses administered as an extension of the primary 
course  –  e.g.  for  severely  immunocompromised  individuals).  Since  the  start  of  COVID-19  vaccine 
deployment in December 2020 and as of 10 April 2022, the cumulative vaccine uptake in the total EU/EEA 
population  has  reached  72.5%  (range:  29.6−86.2%)  for  the  completed  primary  course  and  52.9% 
(range: 8.9-70.7%) for an additional vaccine dose (pooled data from 30 reporting countries). Among 
adults  (aged  18  years  and  over)  in  the  EU/EEA,  the  cumulative  vaccine  uptake  has  reached  83.3% 
(range:  35.2−94.7%)  for  the  complete  primary  course  and  63.9%  (range:  10.8−88.4%)  for  an 
additional vaccine dose (pooled data from 30 reporting countries) (Figure 6). Overall, progress continues 
to vary across EU/EEA countries and a few EU/EEA countries are lagging behind, with two still reporting 
less than 50% uptake of the primary vaccination course in the total population (Bulgaria and Romania).

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are actions that people and communities take to help slowing 
down  the  spread  of  SARS-COV-2  (Flaxman  et  al.,  2020;  Perra,  2021).  Such  community  mitigation 
strategies range from individual actions such as good hand hygiene, appropriate use of face masks or 
physical distancing to more restrictive measures like limiting the size of gatherings or closure of schools 
and work offices. Contact tracing is a key tool for breaking transmission chains. Most NPI can have a 
negative impact on the general well-being of people, the functioning of society, and the economy (Muller 
et al., 2021).

Direct treatment measures to address the symptomology 
Treatment of confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals is based on severity of symptoms (Table 2). 
Coagulopathy  is  common  in  patients  with  severe  COVID-19,  and  both  venous  and  arterial 
thromboembolism have been reported (World Health Organization (WHO), 2021a). 
Table  2.  Recommended  treatments  for  individuals  with  COVID-19  based  on  severity  (World  Health 
Organization (WHO), 2021a) 
Severity 
Treatment 
Mild COVID-19 
• 
Isolation to contain virus transmission. 
•  Symptomatic  treatment  such  as  antipyretics  for  fever  and  pain,  adequate 
nutrition and appropriate rehydration. 
•  Counselling of  patients  with  mild  COVID-19  about  signs  and  symptoms  of 
complications that should prompt urgent care. 
•  Antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis should not be used 
Moderate  COVID-
• 
Isolation  to  contain  virus  transmission.  For  patients  at  high  risk  for 
19 
deterioration, isolation in hospital is preferred. 
•  Use  of  pulse  oximetry  monitoring  at  home  for  symptomatic  patients  with 
COVID-19  and  risk  factors  for  progression  to  severe  disease  who  are  not 
hospitalised. 
•  Antibiotics  should  not  be  prescribed  unless  there  is  clinical  suspicion  of  a 
bacterial infection in patients with suspected or confirmed moderate COVID-
19. Treatment with Access antibiotics (such as co-amoxicillin) is adequate 
in older people, particularly those in LTCFs, and children < 5 years of age. 
•  Close monitoring of patients with moderate COVID-19 for signs or symptoms 
of disease progression. 
Severe COVID-19 
• 
Immediate  administration  of  supplemental  oxygen  therapy  to  any  patient 
with emergency signs during resuscitation to target SpO2 ≥ 94% and to any 
patient without emergency signs and hypoxaemia (i.e., stable hypoxaemic 
patient) to target SpO2 > 90% or ≥ 92–95% in pregnant women. In adults, 
techniques  such  as  positioning,  e.g.,  high  supported  sitting,  may  help  to 
optimize oxygenation, ease breathlessness and reduce energy expenditure. 
•  Closely  monitor  patients  for  signs  of  clinical  deterioration,  such  as  rapidly 
progressive respiratory failure and shock. 
• 
Prone  positioning  of  severely  ill  patients  hospitalized  with  COVID-19 
requiring  supplemental  oxygen  (includes  high  flow  nasal  oxygen)  or  non-
invasive ventilation. 
•  Cautious  fluid  management  in  patients  without  tissue  hypoperfusion  and 
fluid responsiveness.

respiratory 
•  A  trial  of  high-flow  nasal  oxygen  (HFNO),  non-invasive  ventilation  – 
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure 
distress  syndrome 
(BiPAP) may be used in patients with COVID-19 and mild ARDS. Adult HFNO 
(ARDS) 
systems  can  deliver  60  L/min  of  gas  flow  and  FiO2  up  to  1.0.  Paediatric 
• 
• 
circuits generally only handle up to 25 L/min, and many children will require 
an adult circuit to deliver adequate flow. 
Prompt recognition of progressive acute hypoxemic respiratory failure when 
a patient with respiratory distress is failing to respond to standard oxygen 
therapy. 
Implementation  of  mechanical  ventilation  using  lower  tidal  volumes  (4–8 
mL/kg  predicted  body  weight  [PBW])  and  lower  inspiratory  pressures 
(plateau  pressure  <  30  cmH2O).  In  children,  a  lower  level  of  plateau 
pressure (< 28 cmH2O) is targeted, and a lower target of pH is permitted 
(7.15–7.30).  Tidal  volumes  should  be  adapted  to  disease  severity:  3–6 
mL/kg  PBW  in  the  case  of  poor  respiratory  system  compliance,  and  5–8 
mL/kg PBW with better preserved compliance. 
• 
Prone ventilation for 12–16 hours per day in adult patients with severe ARDS 
(PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg). 
•  Conservative  fluid  management  strategy  for  ARDS  patients  without  tissue 
hypoperfusion and fluid responsiveness. 
• 
In  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  ARDS,  a  trial  of  higher  positive  end-
expiratory pressure (PEEP) instead of lower PEEP is suggested and requires 
consideration of benefits versus risks. 
Critical  COVID-19: 
septic shock 
•  Septic  shock  in  adults  when  infection  is  suspected  or  confirmed  AND 
vasopressors  are  needed  to  maintain  mean  arterial  pressure  (MAP)  ≥  65 
mmHg AND lactate is ≥ 2 mmol/L, in the absence of hypovolaemia. 
•  Septic shock in children with any hypotension (SBP < 5th centile or > 2 SD 
below normal for age) or two or more of the following: altered mental status; 
bradycardia or tachycardia (HR < 90 bpm or > 160 bpm in infants and HR 
< 70 bpm or > 150 bpm in children); prolonged capillary refill (> 2 sec) or 
feeble  pulses;  tachypnoea;  mottled  or  cold  skin  or  petechial  or  purpuric 
rash; increased lactate; oliguria; hyperthermia or hypothermia. 
•  Resuscitation  for  septic  shock  in  adults  with  250–500  mL  crystalloid  fluid 
(including normal saline and Ringer’s lactate) as rapid bolus in first 15–30 
minutes.  
•  Resuscitation for septic shock in children with 10–20 mL/kg crystalloid fluid 
as a bolus in the first 30–60 minutes. 
•  Vasopressors  are  administered  when  shock  persists  during  or  after  fluid 
resuscitation. The initial blood pressure target is MAP ≥ 65 mmHg in adults 
and improvement of markers of perfusion.

Natural history of the indicated condition in the population, including 
mortality and morbidity 
The transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are  very similar to those of SARS-CoV and pandemic 
influenza  (Viner  et  al.,  2020;  Rahman  et  al.,  2021).  SARS-CoV-2  presents  a  moderate  to  severe 
infectious threat with a mean R0 range of 2.24 to 3.58 (Rahman et al., 2021). As a respiratory infectious 
disease, the virus is transmitted primarily by droplets, respiratory secretions, and direct contact although 
viral particles have been isolated from faecal swabs and blood. The incubation period on average is 1–
14 days, however, is generally 3–7 days. 
Presenting signs and symptoms of COVID-19 vary. Important factors for consideration include overall 
age of patient, comorbidities, vaccination status (including time after vaccination and waning immunity) 
and  also the  VoC  responsible  for  the  infection.  Preliminary  evidence  suggests  that infections  with  the 
Omicron VoC have a less severe clinical presentation than Delta VoC, for example, but more data are 
needed11. It is important to highlight that lower age, prior immunity from natural infection, vaccination 
including booster dose, and improved treatment options may contribute to observations of less severe 
outcomes and thus, the true risk of severe infection for the Omicron VoC may be underestimated. 
According  to  a  WHO  summary  (World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  2021a),  most  adult  persons 
experience  fever  (83–99%),  cough  (59–82%),  fatigue  (44–70%),  anorexia  (40–84%),  shortness  of 
breath  (31–40%),  myalgias  (11–35%).  Other  non-specific  symptoms,  such  as  sore  throat,  nasal 
congestion, headache, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, have also been reported. Loss of smell (anosmia) 
or loss of taste (ageusia) preceding the onset of respiratory symptoms has also been reported. Additional 
neurological  manifestations  reported  include  dizziness,  agitation,  weakness,  seizures,  or  findings 
suggestive of stroke including trouble with speech or vision, sensory loss, or problems with balance in 
standing or walking. Older people and immunosuppressed patients in particular may present with atypical 
symptoms such as fatigue, reduced alertness, reduced mobility, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, confusion, 
and absence of fever. 
In another European study published in September 2020, 1,420 patients with positive diagnosis of Covid
19 were recruited from 18 European hospitals. The most common symptoms were headache (70.3%), 
‐
loss of smell (70.2%), nasal obstruction (67.8%), cough (63.2%), asthenia (63.3%), myalgia (62.5%), 
rhinorrhoea  (60.1%),  gustatory  dysfunction  (54.2%)  and  sore  throat  (52.9%)  and  fever  (45.4%)

Patients with COVID-19 experience varying degrees of severity. Severity of COVID-19 based on WHO 
definitions is shown in Table 2. Some individuals may be asymptomatic, whereas around 80% of infected 
individuals have only mild infection (Viner et al., 2020; Rahman et al., 2021). In those patients that do 
become symptomatic, most people with COVID-19 develop only mild (40%) or moderate (40%) disease, 
approximately 15% develop severe disease that requires oxygen support, and 5% have critical disease 
with complications such as respiratory failure, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or 
multi-organ failure, including acute kidney injury and cardiac injury (World Health Organization (WHO), 
2021a).  Importantly,  asymptomatic  subjects  may  have  viral  loads  similar  to  those  of  symptomatic 
patients and are thus possible sources of infection. Of the remaining cases, approximately 15% develop 
severe disease characterised by dyspnoea, hypoxia, and lung changes on imaging, and 5% are critically 
ill. The critical ill often include elderly and those with underlying disorders who may experience acute 
respiratory  distress  syndrome  (ARDS),  septic  shock,  metabolic  acidosis,  and  coagulation  dysfunction, 
which may ultimately lead to multiple organ failure and even death. A small percentage of patients also 
manifest  gastrointestinal  symptoms,  such  as  diarrhoea  and  vomiting.  Overall,  poor  clinical  outcomes 
among adult COVID-19 patients are associated with a higher comorbidity burden. 
Based on early studies with the Wuhan strain, mild disease (no or mild pneumonia) was reported in 81% 
of cases, severe disease in 14%, critical disease in 5% with an overall case fatality rate of 2.3% with no 
deaths  reported  among  noncritical  cases  (McKintosh,  2022).  Among  Omicron  cases  with  known 
outcomes,  884  (1.14%)  were  hospitalised,  120  (0.16%)  required  ICU  admission/respiratory  support, 
and  48  (0.06%)  died.  The  pattern  of  higher  rates  of  hospitalisation,  ICU  admission,  and  death  with 
increased age is apparent for Omicron cases, as it has been for Delta and previous variants11. Similarly, 
low hospital admission rates and case fatality for Omicron cases have been observed in some reports, 
whereas  a  shorter  median  length  of  hospital  stay  and/or  significantly  reduced  need  for  respiratory 
support were also reported for Omicron, but more data are needed. 
Post COVID-19 condition 
In addition to the more “traditional” infection and symptom cycle described above, SARS-CoV-2 is also 
known  to  cause  so-called  “long  COVID”  or  “post-COVID  condition”  which  is  generally  defined  as 
individuals  with  ongoing  symptoms  of  COVID-19  that  persist  beyond  four  weeks  from  initial  infection 
(Crook  et  al.,  2021;  Davis  et  al.,  2021;  World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  2021a).  Post-COVID-19 
condition, has manifestations from multiple organ systems and its pathophysiology remains unclear and 
is most likely multifactorial. The estimates of prevalence of prolonged symptoms vary widely depending 
on the time of follow up and the applied definition, and range from 2.3% to 80% (ECDC, 2022a). Older 
age, female sex, poor pre-pandemic mental or general health, asthma, smoking, vaping, hospitalisation, 
or  being  overweight  or  obese  are  factors  associated  with  post  COVID-19  condition.  The  spectrum  of 
presentation, pathophysiology, clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these conditions is under 
investigation. The following symptoms are considered to be the most common for long COVID: fatigue, 
dyspnoea,  cough,  sleep  disturbances,  anxiety,  depression,  cognitive  impairment,  and  difficulty 
concentrating. Fatigue and concentration problems were noted to last beyond 12 weeks. The presence 
of post COVID-19 condition has been also reported in cohorts of children from several countries (ECDC, 
2022a).  
The prevalence of post-acute COVID-19 decreases over time since the acute presentation but it is not 
yet possible to determine how long the symptoms may persist. There is currently no consensus on the 
possible effects of being vaccinated on post-COVID-19 condition (ECDC, 2022a).

SARS-CoV-2 Variants 
Since the emergence of the pandemic situation, there are serious concerns about the emergence of new 
variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Variants of concern (VOCs) were defined as those variants for which 
clear evidence is available indicating a significant impact on transmissibility, severity and/or immunity 
that is likely to have an impact on the epidemiological situation12 (Table 3). Some of these variants have 
already  been  associated  with  higher  transmissibility  and  decreased  susceptibility  to  neutralisation  by 
vaccine-induced  antibodies  compared  to  the  parent  strain,  although  the  overall  impact  on  vaccine 
effectiveness  in  preventing  severe  disease  remains  uncertain  (Weisblum  et  al.,  2020;  Gupta,  2021; 
Harvey et al., 2021; Planas et al., 2021).

At  an  initial  stage  of  development,  the  antigen  was  a  SARS-CoV-2  virus  recombinant  S  protein  RBD 
dimer with the sequence of the Wuhan strain. This antigen was also referred to as “RBD dimer”. The 
vaccine containing the antigen RBD dimer-Wuhan strain, together with SBQA adjuvant was referred to 
as PHH-1. However, due to the quick spread of new variants around the world, HIPRA decided to develop 
a new antigen candidate (based on the same CHO cell platform technology) intended to confer protection 
against the new variants, and the PHH-1 vaccine was discontinued. The new antigen is the SARS-CoV-2 
virus recombinant protein RBD fusion heterodimer - B.1.351-B.1.1.7 variants (beta and alpha variants), 
originally identified in South Africa and UK, respectively. Therefore, the vaccine containing the antigen 
RBD  fusion  heterodimer  together  with  SBQA  adjuvant  corresponds  to  PHH-1V.  Nonclinical  studies 
used both types of antigens: initially RBD dimer (PHH-1), and later RBD fusion heterodimer (PHH-1V).

No single dose toxicology studies with PHH-1V vaccine have been performed or are planned. Instead, 
exposure  obtained  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  covers  in  excess  the  clinical  posology  for  using 
BIMERVAX vaccine as a booster, as currently pursued, or as a prime-boost vaccine for naïve subjects.  
The safety profile of PHH-1V vaccine was assessed by three GLP repeat dose toxicity studies: one with 
PHH-1 vaccine (same vaccine but with a Wuhan-strain antigen) in mice, and two with PHH-1V vaccine 
in rats and rabbits. These GLP studies evaluated the systemic toxicity of the vaccines when administered 
i.m. every two weeks for 29 days (Day 1, Day 15 Day 29), and included a recovery period of 4-weeks. 
The antigen dose tested in mice for PHH-1 vaccine was 50 µg, while in the studies with rats and rabbit 
with PHH-1V, the antigen dose was 40 µg. Additionally, the safety of PHH-1 and PHH-1V vaccines was 
preliminary assessed during the evaluation of the immunogenicity of these vaccine in mice, hamsters, 
pigs and NHPs, as well as in pilot non-GLP studies in mice and rabbits. These studies assessed different 
antigen doses up to 40 µg in the PHH-1V vaccine administered i.m. or SC. The main results of the GLP 
repeat dose toxicity studies are outlined below: 
• 
The GLP toxicity study AC25AA in mice where PHH-1 vaccine was administered i.m. at an antigen 
dose of 50µg antigen in 0.1mL every two weeks for 29 days showed that PHH-1 vaccine caused 
local  dermal  reactions  at  the  administration  site  for  up  to  24  hours  and  increased  body 
temperature.  There  were  no  PHH-1-related  effects  on  clinical  signs,  food  consumption,  body 
weight,  functional  observational  battery  (FOB)  or  clinical  pathology.  Histopathology  analysis 
revealed slight test-item-induced effects in the lung, spleen, mesenteric lymph node, liver, and 
injection site, which were absent after the 4-week recovery period.  
•  A  GLP  repeat  dose  toxicity  study  in  rats  (AC91AA),  where  PHH-1V  vaccine  including  40  µg  of 
antigen was administered i.m. to rats every two weeks for 29 days found that PHH-1V caused 
local dermal reactions at the administration site, which were mild and reversible. There were no 
effects on clinical signs, FOB, food consumption, body weight or clinical pathology. This study 
shows  that  PHH-1V  is  well  tolerated  in  Sprague  Dawley  rats.  There  were  no  observations 
consistent with systemic toxicity, and local reactogenicity was of low magnitude.  
• 
In  the  GLP  toxicity  study  in  rabbits,  PHH-1V  vaccine,  including  a  dose  of  40µg  antigen,  was 
administered every 2 weeks for 28 days. PHH-1V was locally and systemically well tolerated in 
rabbits. As a general conclusion to the whole study, and based on general clinical signs, local 
reactions  at  the  injection  site,  temperature,  body  weight,  feed  consumption,  clinical 
haematology,  biochemistry  and  coagulation  data,  macroscopic  observation  of  tissues  and 
microscopical findings, no adverse or toxicological effects have been identified in rabbits under 
the study conditions. 
Specific studies assessing the toxicity of the SQBA adjuvant alone (without the antigen) were deemed 
not  necessary  considering  the  vast  non-clinical  and  clinical  data  already  available  for  this  adjuvant. 
Moreover, nonclinical data for the SQBA adjuvant when combined with RBD dimer (PHH-1 vaccine) or 
RBD fusion heterodimer (PHH-1V vaccine) have been generated as part of the development of the final 
BIMERVAX  vaccine.  In  this  regard,  the  safety  of  the  SQBA  adjuvant  is  indeed  supported  by  the  good 
safety  profile  of  the  PHH-1  and  PHH-1V  vaccines  in  the  above-described  studies,  including  three  GLP 
studies in mice, rats and rabbits.

Overall, these non-clinical studies support the high tolerability and an excellent safety profile of PHH-1V 
vaccine at antigen and adjuvant doses that are well above those to be used in human. Specifically, doses 
of antigens tested in mice, rat, rabbit and monkey are 176, 39, 10 and 4 times, respectively, higher than 
the proposed dose to be used in human, which is 40µg. Similarly, the adjuvant doses tested in mice, rat, 
rabbit  and  monkey  are 28,  8,  10  and 4  times  higher  than  the  dose used  in human,  which  is 250  µL. 
Moreover, the safety of PHH-1V was assessed in GLP studies after administration of 3 doses of vaccine 
at a frequency of one dose every 2 weeks. Both the number of doses and the frequency of administration 
are above those to be used in the clinical setting, where only one dose of PHH-1V, in the case of the 
intended  booster  indication,  or  2  doses  separated  21  days,  in  the  case  of  a  potential  prime-boost 
indication, will be administered. In addition, no sex-dependent differences were observed in the safety 
profile of PHH-1 or PHH-1V vaccines. 
No genotoxicity studies have been performed with BIMERVAX. No genotoxic potential is expected for the 
recombinant RBD fusion heterodimer antigen, as this type of substances would not interact directly with 
DNA  or  other  chromosomal  material.  Also,  the  non-genotoxic  potential  of  SQBA  adjuvant  has  been 
demonstrated.  Therefore,  its  genotoxicity  is  not  expected,  at  least  at  the  concentration  used  for 
BIMERVAX, which is the same as the concentration used in other currently approved vaccines. 
No  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  conducted  for  BIMERVAX  because  the  product  is  not  to  be 
administer chronically and the nature of its components raise no cause of concern. 
The potential toxicity of PHH-1V on fertility and early embryonic development is being assessed in a GLP 
toxicology  study  (AE80AA)  further  evaluating  the  effect  on  embryofoetal  and  pre-  and  post-natal 
development  in  rats.  This  toxicology  study  is  ongoing.  Nevertheless,  currently,  an  interim  report  is 
available providing fertility data of both males and females. Preliminary results included in this interim 
report demonstrate the good safety profile of PHH-1V as no mortalities have been detected and the body 
weight and local signs were similar between groups. No adverse effects on male and female fertility have 
been detected as the mating index is 100% and reproductive performance is equivalent between groups. 
No  adverse  effects  of  PHH-1V  or  its  associated  immune  response  were  detected  on  embryofoetal  or 
postnatal survival at the current date. Moreover, several aspects support the lack of concern regarding 
potential toxicity of BIMERVAX on fertility. Specifically, an assessment of male and female fertility by 
histopathological examination of the testis and ovaries in the GLP toxicity studies in mice (AC25AA), rat 
(AC91AA)  and  rabbit  (SEP-2021-011-PHH1V)  found  no  effect  of  PHH-1  or  PHH-1V  vaccines  on  these 
organs. Also, no effects on fertility have been described for the SQBA adjuvant at least at the dose to be 
used  in  BIMERVAX.  Moreover,  no  effects  on  fertility  have  been  associated  to  the  development  of 
immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 during the development of other four COVID-19 vaccines currently 
approved  (SmPC  Comirnaty,  2021;  SmPC  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen,  2021;  SmPC  Spikevax,  2021; 
SmPC Vaxzevria, 2021; SmPC Nuvaxovid, 2022).

Table 4. Key Safety Findings and Relevance to Human Usage 
Key Safety findings from Nonclinical Studiesa  Relevance to Human Usage 
Pharmacology 
Challenge studies 
•  No evidence of vaccine-elicited disease 
enhancement at doses up to 40 µg. 
•  Suggests low risk of vaccine-enhanced 
disease in humans; being investigated in 
CTs. Nevertheless, vaccine-enhanced 
disease reactions have been identified as 
a potential risk (see Module SVII) 
Toxicity 
Injection site reactions: 
• 
Local dermal reactions at the administration 
site and increased body temperature were 
common and reversible or showed signs of 
reversibility at the end of the recovery 
period in nonclinical studies. 
• 
In common with other vaccines, 
BIMERVAX administration has the 
potential to generate injection site 
reactions such as oedema and erythema 
at the injection sites. 
Inflammation and immune activation: 
• 
The death of two treated animals after the 
third administration and of one female after 
the second administration could have been 
caused by drug-induced anaphylactic 
reaction. 
•  Anaphylactic reaction could be more 
linked to a species (mice)-specific 
immunological response than to a 
toxicological response, a hypothesis 
confirmed by the histopathology report.  
Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity 
•  No effects on male and female fertility, 
embryofoetal or postnatal survival have 
been detected for the PHH-1V in the GLP 
toxicology study (AE80AA). Moreover, no 
effects have been observed in the 
histopathological examination of the testis 
and ovaries in the GLP toxicity studies with 
PHH 1V. 
•  No effects on fertility have been described 
for the SQBA adjuvant. 
Genotoxicity 
•  No genotoxicity studies have been 
• 
performed. 
The non-genotoxic potential of the SQBA 
adjuvant has been demonstrated in 
analogous adjuvants widely used in 
humans. 
•  No effects are expected in WOCBP, 
pregnant women or their offspring. 
•  No genotoxic potential is expected for as 
this type of substances would not interact 
directly with DNA or other chromosomal 
material.  
a Safety pharmacology, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity studies were not conducted, in accordance with 2005 EMA and WHO 
vaccine guidelines, as they are generally not considered necessary to support development and licensure of vaccines for infectious 
diseases (EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004, 2005; World Health Organization (WHO), 2005).

The  FIH  clinical  trial  with  BIMERVAX,  currently  on-going  in  Spain  (interim  data  are  available; 
Short  Term  Interim  Analysis  Report,  07-April-2022),  is  Phase  I/IIa  clinical  study  HIPRA-HH-1 
(EudraCT:  2021-001411-82)  approved  in  August  2021  by  the  Spanish  national  competent 
authority  (NCA),  AEMPS.  It  is  a  randomised,  controlled,  observer-blinded,  dose-escalation, 
multicentre clinical trial to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 HIPRA vaccine in 
adult healthy volunteers.  
• 
The Phase IIb clinical study HIPRA-HH-2 (EudraCT: 2021-005226-26) is also on-going (interim 
data are available; Interim Analysis Report, 18-May-2022; 6 months Interim Report, 28 Sep-
2022, safety data not updated). It was approved in Spain in November 2021 and is a double-
blind, randomised, active controlled, multi-centre, non-inferiority trial to assess immunogenicity 
and safety of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX (PHH-1V) against SARS-CoV-2, in healthy 
adult volunteers fully vaccinated against COVID 19 followed by an extension period to study a 
fourth dose administration of PHH-1V.  
• 
• 
The Phase III study HIPRA-HH-5 (EudraCT: 2022-000074-25) is also on-going (interim data are 
available; Interim Analysis Report, 24 May 2022). It was approved in Spain in February 2022 
and is an open-label trial, single-arm, multi-centre, international trial to assess the safety and 
immunogenicity  of  a  booster  vaccination  with  BIMERVAX  against  SARS-CoV-2,  in  adults 
vaccinated against COVID-19. 
The Phase IIb study HIPRA-HH-10 (EudraCT: 2022-000795-19) is also on-going (interim data 
are available; Interim Analysis Report, 13-May-2022). It was approved in Spain 8 March 2022 
and is a double-blind, randomized, active controlled, multi-centre, non-inferiority trial to assess 
immunogenicity and safety of a booster vaccination with a recombinant protein RBD fusion dimer 
candidate  (PHH-1V)  against  SARS-COV-2,  in  adults  fully  vaccinated  with  adenovirus  vaccine 
against COVID-19. 
• 
The Phase III study HIPRA-HH-4 (EudraCT: 2022-000785-18) is also ongoing (no interim data 
available  yet).  It  was  approved  in  Spain 9  May  2022  and  is  an  open label,  single  arm,  multi-
centre, trial to assess the immunogenicity and safety of an additional dose vaccination with a 
recombinant protein RBD fusion heterodimer candidate (PHH-1V) against SARS-CoV-2, in adults 
with pre-existing immunosuppressive conditions vaccinated against COVID-19. In Turkey it was 
approved on 28 October 20222. Recruitment in Turkey is ongoing.  
• 
The supportive study HAN-01 is a phase IIb is also on-going (interim data are available; Interim 
Analysis  Report,  7-Apr-2022).  It  was  approved  in  Asia  (Vietnam)  in  November  2021  and  is  a 
randomised, controlled, observer-blinded clinical trial to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of 
BIMERVAX compared with Pfizer–BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine in adult healthy volunteers. 
Currently more than 3000 participants have been exposed to a single booster dose of 40 µg of PHH-1V

Exposure  of  individual  studies,  where  currently  known.  In  the  clinical  trial  Phase  I/IIa  (HIPRA-HH-1), 
there  were  51  screened  subjects  and  30  randomised.  All  randomised  subjects  received  the  PHH-1V 
vaccine and are included in the Safety Population.  
In  the  Phase  IIb  study  (HIPRA-HH-2;  Interim  report  HIPRA-HH-2)  the  safety  analysis  included  765 
subjects that received a dose of the study vaccine: 513 subjects that received the PHH-1V vaccine and 
252 that received the Comirnaty vaccine.  
In  the  Phase  III  study  clinical  trial  HIPRA-HH-5  at  of  the  data  cut-off  date  of  July  18th  2022,  2661 
participants have received the booster dose of 40 µg of PHH-1V.  
In the HAN-01 study there were 629 screened subjects and 256 randomized (128 in the vaccine group 
1 and 128 in the vaccine group 2). All selected subjects were included in the Safety population into one 
of  the  2  groups.  Finally,  121  participants  received  the  second  dose  in  Group  1  and  124  participants 
received the second dose in group 2. 
Recruitment for HIPRA-HH-4 is ongoing and no exposure data for this study is currently available. In the 
Phase IIb HIPRA-HH-10, recruitment is closed with 26 participants vaccinated. 
Table SIII.2 presents the age group and gender information of the clinical trial population, and Table

Exposure to the Adjuvant 
The SQBA adjuvant is an oil-in-water emulsion produced by HIPRA, and its qualitative and quantitative 
composition (9.75 mg squalene; 1.175 mg polysorbate-80; 1.175 mg sorbitan trioleate; 0.66 mg sodium 
citrate and 0.04 mg citric acid monohydrate) is identical to that used in other marketed vaccines in EU. 
Overall, more than 30,000 individuals have participated in clinical trials of SQBA adjuvanted vaccines 
conducted by other MAH and more than 160 million doses of licensed vaccine have been administered 
using adjuvants with the same composition as SQBA. Safety and effectiveness data from clinical trials 
and observation studies attest to the safety of SQBA analogous adjuvants and to its ability to enhance 
the effectiveness of widely used vaccines in children and the elderly. 
Therefore, based on the wide clinical experience using SQBA analogous adjuvants widely used in humans,

Further considerations for COVID-19 vaccines 
Reactogenicity (local and systemic) 
In  accordance  with  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  requirements  (coreRMP19  guidance),  the 
reactogenicity profile of COVID-19 vaccine (adjuvanted) HIPRA, available from the BIMERVAX vaccine 
clinical  development,  is  described  below  for  local  and  systemic  reactions.  Further  analysis  including 
observed differences between ages (younger and older groups) and after the first and second injections 
are still ongoing. 
Phase I/IIa clinical study HIPRA-HH-1 
All of solicited local adverse reactions (ADRs) were considered risks with minimal and temporary clinical 
impact (Grade 1 and 2 severity) on the participants. There were no solicited adverse events with grade 
3 or 4 during the Phase I/IIa clinical study HIPRA-HH-1 (Phase I/IIa HIPRA-HH-1 study is still ongoing, 
only Short Term report safety results are available at the DLP of this RMP). The ADRs identified during 
the clinical development program include solicited local ADRs at the injection site including pain, local 
sensitivity, erythema or redness, induration or swelling. Systemic ADRs reported included fever, vomiting 
or nausea, diarrhoea, headache, fatigue or tiredness, myalgia or muscle pain. 
Local Adverse Reactions: The most frequent solicited local AEs after the first and second dose of either 
vaccine were pain at the injection site (70% subjects dosed with 40 µg PHH-1V versus 100% subjects 
dosed with Comirnaty), local sensitivity (80% both in subjects dosed with 40 µg PHH-1V and Comirnaty), 
erythema/redness (10% subjects dosed with 40 µg PHH-1V versus 0% subjects dosed with Comirnaty) 
and  induration/swelling  (10%  of  subjects  dosed  with  40  µg  PHH-1V  versus  0%  subjects  dosed  with 
Comirnaty). All these local AEs were of low intensity (Grade 1 or 2, mild to moderate) and a clear antigen 
dose-effect was not observed. 
Systemic Adverse Reactions:  
The most frequent solicited systemic AEs were headache (50% subjects dosed with 40 µg PHH-1V versus 
60%  subjects  dosed  with  Comirnaty)  fatigue  (40%  subjects  dosed  with  40  µg  PHH-1V  versus  40% 
subjects dosed with Comirnaty), myalgia (10% subjects dosed with 40 µg PHH-1V versus 40% subjects 
dosed  with  Comirnaty),  and  diarrhoea  (10%  subjects  dosed  with  40  µg  PHH-1V  versus  0%  subjects 
dosed with Comirnaty). All were of mild intensity, except headache which was moderate in one subject 
dosed with 40 µg PHH-1V. Other systemic AEs appeared at a lower frequency. Fever was observed in 3 
out  of  5  (60%)  of  subjects  vaccinated  with  Comirnaty  after  the  administration  of  the  second  dose, 
however  it  was  not  observed  in  any  of  the  subjects  vaccinated  with  BIMERVAX.  Grade  2  headache, 
fatigue and myalgia appeared with a lower frequency in subjects vaccinated with BIMERVAX at any tested 
antigen dose than in subjects vaccinated with Comirnaty.  
Overall, in terms of frequency of systemic AEs, BIMERVAX has demonstrated a safety profile. A lower 
grade of systemic AEs was observed with BIMERVAX compared to Comirnaty.

Phase IIb clinical study HIPRA-HH-2 
Most (89%) of solicited local adverse reactions (ADRs) were considered risks with minimal and temporary 
clinical  impact  (Grade  1  and  2  severity)  on  the  participants.  The  ADRs  identified  during  the  clinical 
development program include solicited local ADRs at the injection site including pain, local sensitivity, 
erythema or redness, induration or swelling. Systemic ADRs reported included fever, vomiting or nausea, 
diarrhoea, headache, fatigue or tiredness, myalgia or muscle pain. 
Local Adverse Reactions: the most frequent solicited local AEs were pain and tenderness, with 75.2% of 
subjects  experiencing  pain  and  65.1%  of  subjects  experiencing  tenderness  on  Day  0,  12  hours  and 
decreasing to 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively, on Day 7. The percentage of subjects who reported solicited 
local  reactions  of  pain  and  tenderness  from  Day  0,  12  hours  to  Day  7  were  higher  in  the  Comirnaty 
vaccine arm compared to the PHH-1V vaccine arm. This is shown predominantly on Day 1 when 69.8% 
of  subjects  reported  pain  and  63.5%  of  subjects  reported  tenderness  in  the  Comirnaty  vaccine  arm, 
however, only 51.1% of subjects reported pain and 48.5% of subjects reported tenderness in the PHH-
1V vaccine arm. 
Systemic Adverse Reactions: the most frequent solicited systemic AEs were fatigue (16.9% on Day 0, 
12 hours, 22.4% on Day 1, 9.4% on Day 2, 5.5% on Day 3, 3.8% on Day 4, 3.0% on Day 5, 2.5% on 
Day 6, Day 1.6% on Day 7). Fatigue was reported more frequently in the Comirnaty vaccine arm on Day 
0, 12 hours (18.7%), Day 1 (35.3%), and Day 2 (13.1%) compared to the PHH-1V vaccine arm (16.0%, 
16.0%, and 7.6%, respectively). Other frequently reported solicited systemic adverse events included 
headache and muscle pain. Overall, both events increased in frequency from Day 0, 12 hours (headache: 
15.7%, muscle pain: 12.4%) to Day 1 (headache: 18.7%, muscle pain: 17.5%) then decreased on Day 
2 (headache: 8.2%, muscle pain: 7.7%) through to Day 7 (headache: 3.4%, muscle pain: 1.0%). In 
general, the frequency of solicited systemic adverse events were similar in the PHH-1V vaccine arm and 
Comirnaty vaccine arm up to 7 days post vaccination. However, in the first days after vaccination the 
frequency was higher in the Comirnaty arm. 
Phase III clinical study HIPRA-HH-5 
Most (84%) of solicited local adverse reactions (ADRs) were considered risks with minimal and temporary 
clinical impact (Grade 1 and 2 severity) on the participants. The most frequently reported types of ADRs 
were injection site pain (82%) and fatigue (31.25%). Other frequently reported ADRs were headache 
(30.88%), diarrhoea (7.75%) and vomiting (5.93%). 
Local Adverse Reactions: The most frequently reported solicited local reactions from Day 0 to Day 7 were 
pain and tenderness, with 63.64% of subjects experiencing pain and 56.92% of subjects experiencing 
tenderness on Day 0 and decreasing to 1.25% and 1.40%, respectively, on Day 7. 
Systemic Adverse Reactions: The most frequently reported solicited systemic event from Day 0 through 
to Day 7 was fatigue. Overall, the percentage of subjects who reported experiencing fatigue was 17.27% 
on Day 0, 19.58% on Day 1, 10.70% on Day 2, 6.08% on Day 3, 4.65% on Day 4, 4.57% on Day 5, 
3.82% on Day 6, and 2.87% on Day 7. Other frequently reported solicited systemic events from Day 0 
through to Day 7 included headache and muscle pain. Overall, both events increased in frequency from 
Day 0 (headache: 14.10%, muscle pain: 11.00%) to Day 1 (headache: 17.35%, muscle pain: 13.23%) 
then decreased on Day 2 (headache: 8.69%, muscle pain: 7.26%) through to Day 7 (headache: 2.87%, 
muscle pain: 1.89%).

Aspects of the formulation 
SQBA adjuvant: 
BIMERVAX  with  SQBA  adjuvant  is  currently  being  evaluated  in  5  ongoing  clinical  trials.  The  SQBA 
adjuvant is an oil-in-water emulsion produced by HIPRA and its qualitative and quantitative composition 
(9.75 mg squalene; 1.175 mg polysorbate-80; 1.175 mg sorbitan trioleate; 0.66 mg sodium citrate and 
0.04 mg citric acid monohydrate) is identical to that used in other currently marketed vaccines in EU. 
Adjuvant fraction in BIMERVAX represents about a 50 % v/v of its final composition. 
More than 30,000 individuals have participated in clinical trials of analogous SQBA adjuvanted vaccines 
conducted by other MAHs and more than 160 million doses of licensed vaccine have been administered.  
Therefore, based on the wide clinical experience using the SQBA adjuvant in identical composition and 
concentration,  no  safety  concerns  are  expected  from  its  inclusion  in  the  formulation  of  BIMERVAX. 
Additionally, analogous adjuvants have shown excellent compatibility with a variety of subunits antigens, 
all of which have been formulated by a simple mixing of antigen with the adjuvant. So, no significant 
interaction between the adjuvant and the antigen is expected. 
In  conclusion,  based  on  the  wide  clinical  available  experience  using  analogous  adjuvants,  in  identical 
composition and concentration, no safety concerns can be expected from its inclusion in the formulation 
of BIMERVAX. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The  HIPRA  List  of  AESI  is  drawn  from  efforts  by  regulatory  authorities,  internationally  recognized 
collaborations, and the scientific literature to identify AESI for vaccinations, and COVID-19 vaccinations 
specifically. BIMERVAX list of AESIs is provided in Annex 7. 
Relevance of long-term follow-up 
Given the expedited nature of the BIMERVAX clinical development programme in response to the global 
COVID-19  pandemic,  understanding  of  the  long-term  safety  profile  of  BIMERVAX  is  currently  limited. 
Consequently, while there is no scientific evidence to suspect an adverse long-term safety profile, it is 
recognised that further follow-up for all vaccines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is 
required. 
In the ongoing clinical studies, it is planned to follow all participants contributing to safety pool for up to 
48 weeks in Phase I/IIa clinical study HIPRA-HH-1, up to 52 weeks after booster vaccination of Day 0 in 
the Phase IIb clinical study HIPRA-HH-2 and up to 26 weeks for the fourth dose, up to 26 weeks in the 
Phase III study HIPRA-HH-5, up to 26 weeks in the Phase IIb HIPRA-HH-10 study, up to 52 weeks in the 
Phase III study HIPRA-HH-4 and up to 24 weeks in the supportive Phase IIb study HAN-01. 
However,  it  is  recognised  that  with  the  increasing  availability  of  alternative  authorised  COVID-19 
vaccines, individuals may seek to receive confirmation of their vaccination status, thereby requesting to 
be unblinded and thus limiting the ability to collect long-term placebo-controlled follow-up data for the 
entire study population in an unbiased fashion.

Risks of vaccination errors in the context of mass vaccination campaigns 
As BIMERVAX may be administered in large-scale vaccination programmes, there may be a potential for 
vaccination  errors.  Vaccination  errors  may  relate  to  administration,  vaccination  scheme,  storage 
conditions,  or  errors  associated  with  multidose  vials.  These  potential  vaccination  errors  are  mitigated 
through a number of strategies:  
•  SmPC section 6.6 contains instructions on handling and administration conditions for COVID-19 
vaccine  (adjuvanted)  HIPRA.  Instructions  on  storage  are  provided  in  SmPC  section  6.4. 
Instructions on vaccination scheme are provided in SmPC section 4.2. 
•  Vaccination  reminder  cards  and  stickers  with  batch/lot  numbers  will  be  available  to  member 
states, if requested, for use by member state vaccinators. 
•  A website (www.hipracovid19.com) will be available for more information 
Furthermore,  as  other  COVID-19  vaccines  are  also  available,  there  is  the  potential  for  confusion  or 
interchangeability with other COVID-19 vaccines. The above mechanisms are in place to facilitate safe 
use and avoidance of vaccination errors. 
SVII.1.2. Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP 
Important Identified Risks 
Pericarditis 
Risk-benefit  impact:  Most  vaccine-associated  pericarditis  events  have  been  mild  and  self-limiting. 
However, pericarditis is an event which may be serious, and although generally mild may be potentially 
life-threatening. Balanced with the risk of death and illness seen with COVID-19 itself, the impact on the 
risk-balance of the vaccine is considered minimal.   
Important Potential Risks: 
Myocarditis 
Risk-benefit  impact:  Most  vaccine-associated  myocarditis  events  have  been  mild  and  self-limiting. 
However, myocarditis is an events which may be serious, and although generally mild may be potentially 
life-threatening. Balanced with the risk of death and illness seen with COVID-19 itself, the impact on the 
risk-balance of the vaccine is considered minimal.   
Vaccine-associated  enhanced  disease  (VAED), 
including  vaccine-associated  enhanced 
respiratory disease (VAERD) 
Risk-benefit  impact:  Vaccination  against  SARS-CoV-2  may  be  associated  with  enhanced  severity  of 
COVID-19 episodes. There is a theoretical risk, mostly based on non-clinical beta-coronavirus data, of 
VAED occurring either before the full vaccine regimen is administered or in vaccinees who have waning 
immunity over time (Agrawal et al., 2016). VAERD refers to the predominantly lower respiratory tract 
presentation  of  VAED.  VAED/VAERD  may  be  serious  or  life-threatening,  and  requires  early  detection, 
careful monitoring, and timely medical intervention. Consequently, if VAED  were to be identified as a 
risk, it could potentially impact the benefit risk.

Missing information 
Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding 
Risk-benefit  impact:  The  target  indication  for  BIMERVAX  is  adults  ≥  16  year  of  age  thus  will  include 
women of childbearing potential. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are typically excluded from initial 
clinical trials. There is no experience with use of BIMERVAX in pregnant women. Studies to assess the 
potential toxicity on fertility are ongoing. Nevertheless, an assessment of male and female fertility by 
histopathological examination of the testis and ovaries in the GLP toxicity studies in mice (AC25AA), rat 
(AC91AA)  and  rabbit  (SEP-2021-011-PHH1V)  found  no  effect  of  PHH-1  or  PHH-1V  vaccines  on  these 
organs. Also, no effects on fertility have been described in the literature for the SQBA adjuvant, at least 
at  the  dose  to  be  used  in  BIMERVAX.  Moreover,  no  effects  on  fertility  have  been  associated  to  the 
development of immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 during the development of other four COVID-19 
vaccines currently approved (SmPC Comirnaty, 2021; SmPC COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, 2021; SmPC 
Spikevax, 2021; SmPC Vaxzevria, 2021; SmPC Nuvaxovid, 2022). Animal studies do not indicate direct 
or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition, or post-
natal development. It is unknown whether BIMERVAX is excreted in human milk. It is important to obtain 
long  term  follow-up  on  women  who  were  pregnant  at  or  around  the  time  of  vaccination  so  that  any 
potential negative consequences to the pregnancy can be assessed and weighed against the effects of 
maternal COVID-19 on the pregnancy. 
Use in immunocompromised patients 
Risk-benefit impact: In the clinical development program, subjects with immunosuppressive conditions 
or medications were to be excluded from the study. However, a study to assess the use of BIMERVAX in 
immunocompromised patients is currently on-going. In general, immunocompromised individuals are at 
greater risk of morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable disease. In addition, the efficacy of the 
vaccine may be lower in immunocompromised individuals, thus decreasing their protection from COVID-
19. Even though there is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving BIMERVAX will 
be  different  to  that  of  the  general  population,  the  possibility  cannot  be  excluded.  Additionally,  a  post 
authorization  study  in  immunocompromised  patients  will  be  conducted  to  assess  the  safety  and 
tolerability of BIMERVAX as a booster dose in adult subjects. 
Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) 
Risk-benefit impact: There is limited information on the safety of the vaccine in frail individuals with co-
morbidities who are potentially at higher risk of severe COVID-19. Although there is no evidence that 
the safety profile of this population receiving BIMERVAX will be different to that of the general population, 
the possibility cannot be excluded. 
Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders 
Risk-benefit impact: There is limited information on the safety of the vaccine in patients with autoimmune 
or inflammatory disorders and a theoretical concern that the vaccine may exacerbate their underlying 
disease. Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving BIMERVAX will 
be different to that of the general population, the possibility cannot be excluded.

Interaction with other vaccines 
Risk-benefit impact: BIMERVAX is indicated as a booster in individuals vaccinated against COVID 19. The 
safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX (PHH-1V) against SARS-CoV-2 in 
healthy  adult  volunteers  fully  vaccinated  against  COVID  19  (Vaxzevria,  Spikevax,  Janssen  and 
Comirnaty), is being evaluated in the Phase IIb clinical study HIPRA-HH-2 and Phase III study HIPRA-
HH-5. Studies to determine if co-administration of BIMERVAX with other vaccines (i.e., with seasonal 
illness vaccines [such as the influenza vaccines]) may affect the efficacy or safety of either vaccine have 
not been performed. 
Long-term safety 
Risk-benefit impact: The long-term safety of BIMERVAX is unknown at present, however further safety 
data are being collected in ongoing clinical trials. The clinical development program has a safety follow 
up period of 48 weeks in Phase I/IIa clinical study HIPRA-HH-1, up to 52 weeks after booster vaccination 
of Day 0 in the Phase IIb clinical study HIPRA-HH-2, up to 26 weeks in the Phase III study HIPRA-HH-5,  
up to 26 weeks in the Phase IIb HIPRA-HH-10 study, up to 52 weeks in the Phase III study HIPRA-HH-
4 and up to 24 weeks in the supportive Phase IIb study HAN-01.

missing information 
SVII.3.1. Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks 
Important Identified Risks 
Pericarditis 
Potential mechanisms: Viruses are the primary cause of pericarditis, including amongst others adeno- 
and enteroviruses. SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with pericarditis as well, and multiple cases have 
been described since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (Klamer et al., 2022). 
Pericarditis has been identified as a possible rare side effect of mRNA vaccines. The pathophysiological 
mechanisms behind the development of myocarditis and pericarditis after a COVID-19 vaccination are 
currently  not  completely  understood.  One  hypothesis  is  that  the  immune  system  detects  the  mRNA 
molecules  as  antigens,  triggering  an  immune  reaction  in  certain  individuals.  Another  mechanism  that 
has been proposed is that antibodies against a part of the SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein that the mRNA 
encodes  for,  cross-react  with  structural  similar  host  proteins  in  the  heart,  also  known  as  molecular 
mimicry (Klamer et al., 2022). 
A mechanism of action by which a vaccine could cause pericarditis has not been established. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: The most important published cohort studies demonstrate 
that  pericarditis  is  a  very  rare  side  effect  after  COVID-19  mRNA  vaccination,  with  an  incidence  of 
approximately 1-4 cases per 100,000 vaccinated subjects. Young males 16-29 appear to be at highest 
risk,  predominantly  after  receiving  the  second  dose  (Klamer  et  al.,  2022).  The  risk  of  pericarditis  is 
Page 41/96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk Management Plan 
BIMERVAX 
Emulsion for injection 
higher in persons who were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 than in those who received the vaccine. Most 
patients fully recover with rest and an adequate treatment. 
The  risk  of  pericarditis  has  shown  to  be  different  depending  on  the  type  of  vaccine/platform  used. 
Vaccines using adenoviral vector-based platforms produce the spike protein but have not been implicated 
in acquired myocarditis (Pillay et al., 2022). Myocarditis and pericarditis events have also been detected 
in  clinical  studies  and  post-authorization  surveillance  of  Novavax  COVID-19  vaccine,  which  is 
manufactured using a different protein platform and a different adjuvant system than BIMERVAX vaccine 
(Twentyman et al., 2022) 
Only one case of a pericarditis event was detected in a clinical study using BIMERVAX.  
Characterisation of the risk: 
Pericarditis is a rare disease with an estimated annual incidence prior to COVID-19 vaccine pandemic of 
16  per  100  000  persons  in  the  general  population.  The  true  incidence  may  be  higher,  as  signs  and 
symptoms vary, and it therefore can be challenging to make the diagnosis (Klamer et al., 2022). 
Clinical Trial experience: 
In  the  phase  III  study  HIPRA-HH-5,  of  the  2646  subjects  included  in  the  safety  dataset,  one  case  of 
pericarditis was reported. The event was considered product related because it could not be discarded 
due  to  temporal  association.  In  the  absence  of  alternative  aetiologies,  a  causal  association  with  the 
vaccine could not be excluded in this case.  
The most important published cohort studies demonstrate that pericarditis is a very rare side effect after 
COVID-19  mRNA  vaccination,  with  an  incidence  of  approximately  1-4  cases  per  100,000  vaccinated 
subjects. Young males 16-29 appear to be at highest risk, predominantly after receiving the second dose 
(Klamer et al., 2022).The risk of pericarditis is higher in persons who were infected with the SARS-CoV-
2 than in those who received the vaccine. 
Pericarditis  events  have  also  been  detected  in  clinical  studies  and  post-authorization  surveillance  of 
Novavax  COVID-19  vaccine,  which  is  manufactured  using  a  different  protein  platform  and  a  different 
adjuvant system than BIMERVAX vaccine (Twentyman et al., 2022). 
Post-marketing experience: 
No postmarketing data are yet available with BIMERVAX vaccine.  
Risk factors and risk groups: Adolescent and young adult males following the second dose of vaccine 
may be at higher risk (Gargano et al., 2021). 
Preventability: Considering that a mechanism of action by which a vaccine could cause pericarditis has 
not been established, preventative measures cannot be defined at this time. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
The rate of vaccine-associated pericarditis is low, and the events have been mild and self-limiting. In 
consideration of the fact that the risk of death and illness (including myocarditis) seen with SARS-CoV-
2 itself, the impact on the risk-benefit balance of the vaccine is considered as minimal.

Public health impact:  
The public health impact of the potential risk of pericarditis is expected to be low as pericarditis are very 
rare side effects after COVID-19 vaccination and events have been mild and self-limiting. 
Important potential risks 
Myocarditis 
Potential mechanisms: Viruses are the primary cause of myocarditis, including amongst others adeno- 
and enteroviruses. SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with myocarditis as well, and multiple cases have 
been described since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (Klamer et al., 2022).

manufactured using a different protein platform and a different adjuvant system than BIMERVAX vaccine 
(Twentyman et al., 2022) 
Considering limited safety data, the available evidence is not sufficient to rule out myocarditis as a safety 
concern. Thus, it is added as an important potential risk.  
Characterisation of the risk: 
Myocarditis is a rare disease with an estimated annual incidence prior to COVID-19 vaccine pandemic of 
16  per  100  000  persons  in  the  general  population.  The  true  incidence  may  be  higher,  as  signs  and 
symptoms vary, and it therefore can be challenging to make the diagnosis (Klamer et al., 2022). 
Clinical Trial experience: 
No case of myocarditis has been observed in the clinical trials of BIMERVAX vaccine. 
The most important published cohort studies demonstrate that myocarditis is a very rare side effect after 
COVID-19  mRNA  vaccination,  with  an  incidence  of  approximately  1-4  cases  per  100,000  vaccinated 
subjects. Young males 16-29 appear to be at highest risk, predominantly after receiving the second dose

(Klamer et al., 2022).The risk of myocarditis is higher in persons who were infected with the SARS-CoV-

Public health impact:  
The public health impact of the potential risk of myocarditis is expected to be low as myocarditis is very 
rare side effect after COVID-19 vaccination and events have been mild and self-limiting. 
Vaccine-associated  enhanced  disease  (VAED), 
including  vaccine-associated  enhanced 
respiratory disease (VAERD) 
Potential  mechanisms:  The  pathogenesis  of  VAED  in  the  context  of  SARS-CoV-2  is  unclear.  Although 
animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection have not shown evidence of VAED after immunisation, cellular 
immunopathology  has  been  demonstrated  after  viral  challenge  in  some  animal  models  administered 
SARS-CoV-1  (murine,  ferret  and  non-human  primate  models)  or  MERS-CoV  (mice  model)  vaccines. 
(Haynes et al., 2020; Lambert et al., 2020). VAERD refers to the predominantly lower respiratory tract 
presentation of VAED. The mechanism of the pathogenesis of VAERD may include both T cell-mediated 
[an immunopathological response favouring T helper cell type 2 (Th2) over T helper cell type 1 (Th1)] 
and  antibody-mediated  immune  responses  (antibody  responses  with  insufficient  neutralizing  activity 
leading to formation of immune complexes and activation of complement or allowing for Fc-mediated 
increase  in  viral  entry  to  cells)  (Graham,  2020).  Less  severe  cases  of  SARS  were  associated  with 
accelerated  induction  of  a  Th1  cell  response;  whereas,  Th2  cell  responses  have  been  associated  with 
enhancement of lung disease following infection in hosts parenterally vaccinated with inactivated SARS-
CoV vaccines (Lambert et al., 2020).  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: This potential risk is theoretical because it has not been 
described  in  association  with  the  BIMERVAX  vaccine  or  it  has  not  been  reported  from  any  other  late 
phase clinical trial of other human vaccine. As mentioned above, this potential risk has been included 
based on these animal data with these related betacoronaviruses. VAERD refers to the predominantly 
lower respiratory tract presentation of VAED. Evidence sources have been collected from literature on 
viral vaccines, safety information of other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and clinical trials. VAED was observed

BIMERVAX 
Emulsion for injection 
in children given formalin-inactivated whole-virus vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 
measles virus. It has been rarely encountered with existing vaccines or viral infections (Haynes et al., 
2020).  Although,  no  events  of  VAED/VAERD  have  been  reported  in  the  current  BIMERVAX  clinical 
development programme, there is a theoretical concern that vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 may be 
associated  with  enhanced  severity  of  COVID-19  episodes,  which  would  manifest  as  VAED/VAERD 
(Graham, 2020). 
Characterisation of the risk: No events of VAED/VAERD have been reported in the current BIMERVAX 
clinical  development  programme.  Currently,  VAED/VAERD  has  not  been  reported  in  other  COVID-19 
vaccines.  If  it  would  occur  in  vaccinated  individuals,  VAED/VAERD  will  manifest  as  a  modified  and/or 
more severe clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection upon subsequent natural infection. This 
may  result  having  higher  rates  of  unfavourable  outcomes,  especially  in  individuals  at  known  risk  for 
severe COVID-19 (e.g., older or immunocompromised).  
Risk factors and risk groups: No risks groups or risks factors have been identified. Nevertheless, it is 
postulated that the potential risk may be increased in individuals producing lower neutralizing antibody 
titres or in those demonstrating waning immunity (Graham, 2020). 
Preventability:  Information  about  the  prevention  of  VAED/VAERD  in  the  context  of  SARS-COV-2  is 
currently unknown as the risk is theoretical.  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
VAED (including VAERD) may present as severe disease or modified/unusual clinical manifestations of a 
known disease presentation and may involve one or multiple organ systems. Subjects with VAED/VAERD 
may  experience  rapid  clinical  deterioration  and  will  likely  require  non-invasive  or  invasive  mechanical 
ventilation; and patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome have poorer prognosis and 
potentially higher mortality rate. 
Public  health  impact:  The  potential  risk  of  VAED/VAERD  could  have  a  public  health  impact  if  large 
populations of individuals are affected. As this safety concern is currently theoretical and has not been 
observed in the ongoing BIMERVAX vaccine clinical trials, there is no public health impact at this time.

SVII.3.2. Presentation of the missing information 
Missing information 
Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding 
Evidence source: There is no experience with use of BIMERVAX vaccine in pregnant women. Nevertheless, 
an assessment of male and female fertility by histopathological examination of the testis and ovaries in 
the GLP toxicity studies in mice (AC25AA), rat (AC91AA) and rabbit (SEP-2021-011-PHH1V) found no 
effect of PHH-1 or PHH-1V vaccines on these organs. Also, no effects on fertility have been described for 
the  SQBA  adjuvant,  according to  analogous  adjuvants, at  least  at  the  dose  to  be  used in  BIMERVAX. 
Moreover,  no  effects  on  fertility  have  been  associated  to  the  development  of  immunogenicity  against 
SARS-CoV-2  during  the  development  of  other  four  COVID-19  vaccines  currently  approved  (SmPC 
Comirnaty,  2021;  SmPC  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen,  2021;  SmPC  Spikevax,  2021;  SmPC  Vaxzevria, 
2021;  SmPC  Nuvaxovid,  2022).  Animal  studies  do  not  indicate  direct  or  indirect  harmful  effects  with 
respect 
to  pregnancy,  embryo/foetal  development,  parturition,  or  post-natal  development. 
Administration of BIMERVAX vaccine in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits 
outweigh  any  potential  risks  for  the  mother  and  foetus.  It  is  unknown  whether  BIMERVAX  vaccine  is 
excreted in human milk. 
Anticipated  risk/consequence  of  the  missing  information:  Targeted  populations  of  the  indication  will 
include women of childbearing potential, thus, the use of BIMERVAX in pregnant and/or breastfeeding 
women will occur. 
Use in immunocompromised patients 
Evidence source: Subjects with immunosuppressive conditions or medications were to be excluded from 
the  study  in  the  BIMERVAX  clinical  development  program.  Studies  to  assess  the  use  of  BIMERVAX  in 
immunocompromised patients are ongoing.  There is no evidence that the safety profile of this population 
receiving BIMERVAX will be different to that of the general population, but given the paucity of data, the 
possibility cannot be ruled out. 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: As the vaccinees weakened immune system 
may  not  reach  a  sufficient  response,  vaccines  may  be  less  effective  in  individuals  with  compromised 
immune  function  due  to  acquired  or  genetic  conditions  or  conditions  requiring  the  use  of 
immunosuppressants.

Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) 
Evidence source: The BIMERVAX has not been studied in frail individuals with severe comorbidities that 
may compromise immune function due to the condition or treatment of the condition. Frail patients with 
comorbidities (e.g., COPD, diabetes mellitus, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) are 
potentially at risk of developing a more severe manifestation of COVID-19. There is no evidence that the 
safety profile of this population receiving BIMERVAX will be different to that of the general population, 
but given the scarcity of data, the possibility cannot be ruled out. 
Anticipated  risk/consequence  of  the  missing  information:  In  general,  there  is  a  potential  that  frail 
participants with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities may experience a different outcome than 
achieved in healthy individuals administered vaccines. 
Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders 
Evidence source: There is limited information on the safety of the vaccine in patients with autoimmune 
or  inflammatory  disorders.  Although  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  safety  profile  of  this  population 
receiving BIMERVAX will be different to that of the general population, the possibility cannot be excluded. 
Anticipated  risk/consequence  of  the  missing  information:  In  general,  individuals  with  autoimmune  or 
inflammatory  disorders  may  experience  a  different  outcome  than  achieved  in  healthy  individuals 
administered vaccines. 
Interaction with other vaccines 
Evidence source: BIMERVAX is indicated as a booster in individuals vaccinated against COVID 19. The 
safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX (PHH-1V) against SARS-CoV-2 in 
healthy  adult  volunteers  fully  vaccinated  with  Vaxzevria,  Spikevax,  Janssen  and  Comirnaty  vaccines 
against COVID 19, is being evaluated in the Phase IIb clinical studies HIPRA-HH-2 and HIPRA-HH10, and 
in  the  Phase  III  studies  HIPRA-HH-5  and  HIPRA-HH-4.  Studies  to  determine  if  co-administration  of 
BIMERVAX with other vaccines (i.e., with seasonal illness vaccines [such as the influenza vaccines]) may 
affect the efficacy or safety of either vaccine have not been performed. 
Population  in  need  of  further  characterisation:  Subjects  fully  vaccinated  against  COVID  19  after 
immunisation with BIMERVAX 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: There is the theoretical question as whether 
vaccines  may  interact  with  each  other  and  change  the  immune  response  to  either  vaccine  or  induce 
safety  concerns.  It  is  common  medical  practice  to  administer  vaccines  concurrently.  Participants 
receiving  BIMERVAX  may  be  administered  seasonal  flu  vaccines  during  the  vaccination  period  of  the 
pandemic. 
Long-term safety 
Evidence  source:  Understanding  of  the  long-term  safety  profile  of  BIMERVAX  is  currently  limited. 
Nevertheless, per protocols, the clinical development program has a safety follow up period of 48 weeks 
in Phase I/IIa clinical study HIPRA-HH-1, up to 52 weeks after booster vaccination of Day 0 in the Phase 
IIb clinical study HIPRA-HH-2, up to 26 weeks in the Phase III study HIPRA-HH-5 up to 26 weeks in the 
Phase IIb HIPRA-HH-10 study, up to 52 weeks in the Phase III study HIPRA-HH-4 and up to 24 weeks 
in the supportive study HAN-01 is a Phase IIb.

potentially late onset, given the limited data, the possibility cannot be excluded. Data will continue to be

III.1 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
Routine  pharmacovigilance  (PV)  activities  for  the  lifecycle  of  a  product  are  critical  components  to  the 
detection,  assessment,  and  understanding  of  risks.  Objectives  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  include 
having processes in place to assure the ongoing and timely collection, processing, follow-up, and analysis 
of  individual  AE  reports  and  aggregate  data  globally,  following  global  safety  Standard  Operating 
Procedures  and  regulatory  guidance.  Activities  include  the  collection,  processing  and  analysis  of 
individual case safety reports, the review and reporting on aggregate data, and a signal detection system. 
Hipra monitors the safety profile of its products, evaluates issues potentially impacting product benefit-
risk  profiles  in  a  timely  manner,  and  ensures  that  appropriate  communication  of  relevant  safety 
information  is  conveyed  in  a  timely  manner  to  regulatory  authorities  and  other  interested  parties  as 
appropriate and in accordance with international principles and prevailing regulations. 
Routine PV activities are consistent with the EMA Guidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP). 
A comprehensive description of all aspects of the PV system is provided in the Pharmacovigilance System 
Master File (PSMF), which is available upon request. 
  Signal detection and management 
HIPRA has a safety surveillance and reporting system in place to organize the collection, data entry in 
the company global safety database and evaluation of any AEs or other safety information reported to 
HIPRA  and  an  established  signal  management  process  including  signal  detection,  validation  and 
evaluation of spontaneous reports from all sources. Potential signal detection data sources include safety 
data from MAH-sponsored clinical trials and non-interventional studies; spontaneous AE reports; specific 
review of AEs consistent with the AESI list provided in Annex 7, which considers relevant sources such 
as  Brighton  Collaboration  SPEAC  list,  ACCESS  Project  AESI  and  cases  definitions,  CBER  Surveillance 
Program – list of AESI; non-clinical studies; quality and manufacturing reports; published literature; and 
communications  from  external  sources,  including  regulatory  agencies,  and  (if  applicable)  business 
partners.  The  detection  of  signals  described  in  the  BIMERVAX  Signal  Detection  System  plan  involves 
qualitative and quantitative pharmacovigilance methods. In addition, observed versus expected analyses 
will be conducted periodically as part of routine signal management activity and will use appropriate lists 
of AESI and background rates from ACCESS, CONSIGN and ConcePTION. The primary data sources for 
signal detection and the minimum frequency of review are outlined below.

  Summary Safety Reports (SSRs) 
In addition to routine 6-monthly PSUR production, SSRs are compiled to support timely and continuous 
benefit  risk  evaluations.  Given  the  current  COVID-19  vaccination  patterns,  the  initiation  of  summary 
safety reports submission requirement for new vaccines should only be triggered by the start of mass 
vaccination  using  the  product  in  any  EU  Member  State.  The  need  and  periodicity  of  continuing  the 
submission of the summary safety reports will be initiated by the rapporteur and re-evaluated based on 
the available postmarketing evidence for each vaccine, and at the request of the MAH, as soon as the 
safety data enables a decision to be made. Topics covered by SSR include: 
• 
• 
Interval and cumulative number of reports, overall and stratified by age groups and in special 
populations  (e.g.,  pregnant  women),  by  report  type,  (medically  confirmed  vs.  non-medically 
confirmed) and by seriousness; 
Interval and cumulative number of reports per HLT and SOC;  
•  Reports per EU country; 
• 
Exposure data based on administered doses rather than distributed doses whenever possible, 
stratified by region (country within the EU), by age groups, gender and by dose number (when 
applicable); 
•  Safety-related changes to the reference safety information and actions taken in the interval 
• 
List  of  ongoing  and  closed  signals  in  the  interval,  including  a  summary  of  their  evaluation; 
reviews of signals identified during the period or of safety topics identified by EMA and requested 
to be addressed in the SSR; 
•  Summaries of reported cases of selected AESIs considered relevant for periodically review with 
the  SSR  submission  and  RMP  safety  concerns:  report  numbers  and  relevant  cases,  including 
observed versus expected (O/E) analysis using appropriate lists of AESI and background rates 
from  ACCESS,  CONSIGN  and  ConcePTION,  an  adequate  risk  window  and,  when  appropriate, 
stratified by age groups or presented per region/EU country (e.g. if background rates vary), and 
complemented with a sensitivity analysis. 
•  Discussion  if  any  unusual  pattern  of  fatal  reports  (considering  co-morbidities  and  frailty)  is 
observed during initial post-marketing use; 
•  Data  on  medication  errors,  if  a  pattern  of  errors  leading  to  harm  is  identified  and/or  risk 
minimisation activities are considered warranted; 
•  Details of the search strategy, case definitions for all provided reviews and methodology for O/E 
analyses including source of background rates, risk windows, etc.; 
•  Risk/benefit considerations.

  Traceability 
The SmPC includes instructions for healthcare professionals to record the name and batch number of the 
administered vaccine to improve traceability (section 4.4) and to report any suspected adverse reactions 
including batch/Lot number if available (section 4.8). 
HIPRA has available vaccination reminder cards (Annex 7) to member states, that may be completed at 
the time of vaccination when necessary for individual members states. The card will be also accessible 
electronically and though a QR code, on the applicant’s website. 
The Traceability and Vaccination Reminder cards contain the following elements: 
• 
Placeholder space for name of vaccinee; 
•  Vaccine brand name and manufacturer name; 
• 
• 
Placeholder space for date of vaccination; 
Placeholder space for the batch number; 
•  Reminder to retain the card ”Make sure you keep this card”; 
•  QR code that links to a website with additional information on product use; and 
•  Adverse event reporting information. 
In addition, two traceability stickers per dose, containing both printed and a 2D-code encoding brand 
name and batch/lot number will be made available to support documentation of the batch/lot traceability. 
We  also  acknowledge  that  some  EU  member  states  may  require  utilisation  of  nationally  mandated 
vaccination  cards  or  electronic  systems  to  document  batch/lot  number;  therefore,  the  available 
traceability and vaccination reminder cards and/or stickers with printed lot/batch information may not 
be utilised in all member states

Planned post-authorisation studies 
To  further  characterise  the  BIMERVAX  safety  and  effectiveness  profile,  the  following  two  (2)  non-
interventional studies will be conducted: 
Study  name  and  title:  Post-authorisation  safety study  of  BIMERVAX  emulsion  for  injection  in 
Europe in VAC4EU  
Rationale and study objectives: This study consists of two components—a vaccine utilisation study and 
a comparative safety study—. The vaccine utilisation study will characterise the individuals receiving the 
BIMERVAX vaccine. The comparative safety study uses two different designs: a cohort design to estimate 
the  effect  of  BIMERVAX  vaccine  on  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  compared  with  that  of 
other COVID-19 vaccines authorised for the same indication; and a self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) 
study (a subtype of the self-controlled case series design) design to estimate the effect of the COVID-
19 HIPRA vaccine booster on selected AESIs compared with no COVID-19 vaccination booster. 
The study objectives are:  
1.  The  objective  of  the  vaccine  utilisation  study  will  be  to  characterise  recipients  BIMERVAX  in 
relation  to  demographics  and  clinical  characteristics  at  the  time  of  vaccination,  including  the 
following:  pregnancy  status,  age  of  childbearing  potential,  immunocompromised  status, 
comorbidities, presence of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, and interaction with other 
vaccines (influenza). 
2.  The objective of the comparative study: 
a.  Using a cohort design will be to estimate the effect of BIMERVAX on adverse events of 
special interest (AESIs)—as described in a protocol for the vACCine covid-19 monitoring 
readinESS (ACCESS) project (Dodd et al., 2020)—compared with that of other COVID-
19 vaccines authorised for the booster indication. 
b.  Using a SCRI design will be to estimate the effect of BIMERVAX booster on selected AESIs 
(those  that  can  be  studied  under  a  self-controlled  design  as  specified  in  ACCESS) 
compared with no COVID-19 vaccine as a booster. 
Study design: The vaccine utilisation study will be descriptive and will characterise eligible individuals at 
the time of vaccination. The comparative safety component will follow ACCESS specifications for vaccine 
safety studies, for both the cohort and SCRI studies. The SCRI design was chosen over a SCCS because 
the  SCRI  design  uses  a  post-exposure  control  period  to  minimise  the  probability  of  violating  the 
assumption that the outcome does not influence the exposure. The study period will be from the date of 
availability of BIMERVAX in each participant country to 2-3 years past that date, pending the timing and 
potential seasonality of booster administration campaigns. 
Study population: The eligible population for the vaccine utilisation study will be all individuals actively 
enrolled in each of the selected European health data sources for at least 12 months before vaccination 
with BIMERVAX who receive a dose of BIMERVAX within the study period.

The general eligibility criteria for the cohort comparative safety study will be as follows: 
  Receipt  of  a  full  primary  vaccination  course  with  an  mRNA  and/or  an  adenovirus  COVID-19 
vaccine. 
  Receipt of a dose of the COVID-19 HIPRA vaccine or another COVID-19 vaccine with the same 
indication. The date of this vaccination will be the cohort entry date. 
 
For each AESI, a previous diagnosis of that AESI will exclude an individual from participation. 
The general eligibility criteria for the SCRI comparative safety study will be as follows: 
  Receipt  of  a  full  primary  vaccination  course  with  an  mRNA  and/or  an  adenovirus  COVID-19 
vaccine. 
  Receipt of a dose of the COVID-19 HIPRA vaccine. The date of this vaccination will be time zero, 
i.e., the anchor to define the risk and control intervals. 
  Having experienced the AESI of interest in either the risk or control interval. 
Milestones: The study protocol is planned to be submitted 3 months following receipt of first regulatory 
authorisation in the EEA (estimated date:31 July 2023). One progress report is planned for submission 
3 months after protocol endorsement. Two interim reports are planned to be submitted at 12 and 24 
months following rollout of BIMERVAX booster vaccination campaigns in the first participating country. 
A final study report is planned for submission at 36 months after rollout of BIMERVAX booster vaccination 
campaigns in the first participating country, and 48 months in the case of pregnancy outcomes. 
Study name and title: COVID-19 Vaccines International Pregnancy Exposure Registry (C-VIPER) 
Rationale  and  study  objectives:  BIMERVAX  emulsion  for  injection  Covid-19  Vaccine  (recombinant, 
adjuvanted) will be used in pregnant populations. Scientific evidence regarding its safety for pregnant 
women and the developing fetus is lacking. 
The study objective is: 
- 
To estimate the risk of obstetric outcomes (spontaneous abortion, antenatal bleeding, gestational 
diabetes,  gestational  hypertension,  intrauterine  growth  restriction,  postpartum  hemorrhage, 
fetal  distress,  uterine  rupture,  placenta  previa,  chorioamnionitis,  Caesarean  delivery,  COVID-
19),  neonatal  outcomes  (major  congenital  malformations,  low  birth  weight,  neonatal  death, 
neonatal  encephalopathy,  neonatal  infections,  neonatal  acute  kidney  injury,  preterm  birth, 
respiratory distress in the newborn, small for gestational age, stillbirth, COVID-19), and infant 
outcomes (developmental milestones [motor, cognitive, language, social-emotional, and mental 
health skills], height, weight, failure to thrive, medical conditions during the first 12 months of 
life,  COVID-19)  among  pregnant  women  exposed  to  single  (homologous)  or  mixed 
(heterologous) BIMERVAX series from 30 days prior to the first day of the last menstrual period 
(LMP) to end of pregnancy and their offspring relative to a matched reference group who received 
no COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy. 
Study design: The C-VIPER is an international, non-interventional, post-marketing cohort study designed 
to collect prospective safety data among women vaccinated with BIMERVAX during pregnancy or within 
30 days prior to the first day of the LMP.  
Study population: The study population will include 2 cohorts of pregnant women 18 years of age and 
older matched by country and gestational age (±2 weeks): 
•  Cohort  1:  pregnant  women  exposed  from  30  days  prior  to  the  first  day  of  the  LMP  to  end  of 
pregnancy to at least one dose of BIMERVAX. These participants are enrolled as part of the C-
VIPER.

•  Cohort  2:  pregnant  women  unexposed  to  a  COVID-19  vaccine  during  pregnancy.  These 
participants are enrolled through the Pregistry International Exposure Registry (PIPER) with the 
same methods as those in Cohort 1. Women vaccinated before 30 days prior to the first day of 
the LMP are eligible for inclusion. 
Registration  and  participation  via  a  website  especially  developed  for  the  C-VIPER  will  be  voluntary. 
Eligible women can enrol at any time during pregnancy. 
Milestones: The total duration of the study will be 5 years. Obstetric, neonatal, and infant outcomes will 
be  assessed  on  an  ongoing  basis  as  data  become  available.  Data  on  pregnancy,  neonatal  and  infant 
outcomes will be included in the interim reports as soon as available. The first two years will include, 
primarily, enrolment of pregnancies; the third and fourth years will involve follow-up of pregnancies and 
newborns;  and,  the  final  year,  will  be  for  data  analyses  and  publications.  Results  on  pregnancy  and 
neonatal outcomes, even preliminary, are expected within the first year of the study. . The study protocol 
is  planned  to  be  submitted  3  months  following  receipt  of  first  regulatory  authorisation  in  the  EEA 
(estimated date: 31 July 2023). A final report is planned for submission within 12 months after study 
completion (estimated date: 31 July 2029). 
Study  name  and  title:  Post-authorisation  effectiveness  study  of  BIMERVAX  emulsion  for 
injection in Europe in VAC4EU 
Rationale and study objectives: This study will evaluate the risk of COVID-related outcomes due to the 
use of BIMERVAX vaccine compared with use of other COVID-19 vaccines with the same indication. 
The study objective is:  
1.  To  estimate  the  effect  of  the  BIMERVAX  on  COVID-19–related  outcomes—i.e., COVID-19 
infection,  COVID-19–related  hospitalisations  or  emergency  department  visits—compared  with 
other COVID-19 vaccines authorised for the booster indication. 
Study design: This will be a cohort study following the vaccine covid-19 monitoring readinESS (ACCESS) 
project  specifications  for  vaccine  effectiveness  studies.  The  study  period  will  be  from  the  date  of 
availability of the BIMERVAX in each participant country to 2-3 years past that date pending timing and 
potential seasonality of booster administration campaigns. Non-interventional study. 
Study  population:  The  general  eligibility  criteria  for  the  comparative  effectiveness  study  will  be  as 
follows: 
  Received a full primary vaccination course with an mRNA and/or an adenovirus COVID-19 
vaccine. 
  Received a dose of the BIMERVAX or of another COVID-19 vaccine with the same approved 
indication. The date of this vaccination will be the cohort entry date. 
Milestones: The study protocol is planned to be submitted 4 months following receipt of first regulatory 
authorisation in the EEA (estimated date:31 August 2023). One progress report is planned for submission 
3  months  after  protocol  endorsement.  An  interim  report  is  planned  to  be  submitted  at  12  months 
following rollout of BIMERVAX booster vaccination campaigns in the first participating country. A final 
study report is planned for submission at 24-36 months after rollout of BIMERVAX booster vaccination 
campaigns  in  the  first  participating  country.  Schedule  is  dependent  on  protocol  endorsement  date, 
uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine (adjuvanted) HIPRA, approvals for data extraction and contracts with 
research team and occurrence of COVID-19 waves.

Risk Management Plan 
BIMERVAX 
Emulsion for injection 
Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for BIMERVAX 
emulsion for injection 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for BIMERVAX emulsion for injection. The RMP 
details important risks of BIMERVAX, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about BIMERVAX’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
BIMERVAX  's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how BIMERVAX should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for BIMERVAX should be read in the context of all this information including 
the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of BIMERVAX's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
BIMERVAX is a bivalent vaccine indicated as a booster for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in 
individuals 16 years of age and older who have previously received a mRNA vaccine COVID-19 vaccine 
(see SmPC for the full indication). It contains COVID-19 Vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) as the active 
substance and it is given by intramuscular injection  
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  BIMERVAX  vaccine  benefits  can  be  found  in  the 
corresponding EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage <link to the EPAR summary landing page>.  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of BIMERVAX, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about BIMERVAX risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks.

Risk Management Plan 
BIMERVAX 
Emulsion for injection 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment and  MSSRs so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of BIMERVAX is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of BIMERVAX are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use BIMERVAX. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that 
is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Pericarditis  
Evidence for linking the risk 
The  most  important  published  cohort  studies  demonstrate  that 
to the medicine 
pericarditis is a very rare side effect after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, 
with  an  incidence  of  approximately  1-4  cases  per  100,000  vaccinated 
subjects. Young males 16-29 appear to be at highest risk, predominantly 
after receiving the second dose. The risk of pericarditis is higher in people 
who were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 than in those who received the 
vaccine. Most patients fully recover with rest and an adequate treatment.  
The risk of pericarditis has shown to be different depending on the type 
of  vaccine/platform  used.  Vaccines  using  adenoviral  vector-based 
platforms  produce  the  spike  protein  but  have  not  been  implicated  in 
acquired  myocarditis.  Pericarditis  events  have  also  been  detected  in 
clinical studies and post-authorization surveillance of Novavax COVID-19 
vaccine, which is manufactured using a different protein platform and a 
different adjuvant system than BIMERVAX vaccine.  
Only one case of a pericarditis event was detected in a clinical study using 
BIMERVAX.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Adolescent and young adult males following the second dose of COVID-
19 vaccine may be at higher risk.

Important potential risk: Myocarditis 
Evidence for linking the risk 
The  most  important  published  cohort  studies  demonstrate  that 
to the medicine 
myocarditis is a very rare side effect after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, 
with  an  incidence  of  approximately  1-4  cases  per  100,000  vaccinated 
subjects. Young males 16-29 appear to be at highest risk, predominantly 
after  receiving  the  second  dose.  The  risk  of  myocarditis  is  higher  in 
people  who  were  infected  with  the  SARS-CoV-2  than  in  those  who 
received  the  vaccine.  Most  patients  fully  recover  with  rest  and  an 
adequate treatment.  
The  risk  of  myocarditis  and  pericarditis  has  shown  to  be  different 
depending  on  the  type  of  vaccine/platform  used.  Vaccines  using 
adenoviral  vector-based  platforms  produce  the  spike  protein  but  have 
not been implicated in acquired myocarditis. Myocarditis and pericarditis 
events have also been detected in clinical studies and post-authorization 
surveillance of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, which is manufactured using

Emulsion for injection 
Important  potential  risk:  Vaccine-associated  enhanced  disease  (VAED),  including  vaccine-
associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
This  potential  risk  is  theoretical  because  it  has  not  been  described  in 
to the medicine 
association with the BIMERVAX vaccine or it has not been reported from 
any other late phase clinical trial of other human vaccine. As mentioned 
above, this potential risk has been included based on animal data with 
related  betacoronaviruses.  VAERD  refers  to  the  predominantly  lower 
respiratory  tract  presentation  of  VAED.  Evidence  sources  have  been 
collected  from  literature  on  viral  vaccines,  safety  information  of  other 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and clinical trials. VAED was observed in children 
given  formalin-inactivated  whole-virus  vaccines  against  respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV) and measles virus. It has been rarely encountered 
with existing vaccines or viral infections (Haynes et al., 2020). Although, 
no events of VAED/VAERD have been reported in the current BIMERVAX 
clinical  development  programme,  there  is  a  theoretical  concern  that 
vaccination  against  SARS-CoV-2  may  be  associated  with  enhanced 
severity  of  COVID-19  episodes,  which  would  manifest  as  VAED/VAERD 
(Graham, 2020). 
Risk factors and risk groups  No risks groups or risks factors have been identified. Nevertheless, it is 
postulated that the potential risk may be increased in individuals 
producing lower neutralizing antibody titres or in those demonstrating 
waning immunity (Graham, 2020).

Missing information: Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding 
Evidence for linking the risk 
There  is  no  experience  with  use  of  BIMERVAX  vaccine  in  pregnant 
to the medicine 
women.  Nevertheless,  an  assessment  of  male  and  female  fertility  by 
histopathological examination of the testis and ovaries in the GLP toxicity 
studies  in  mice  (AC25AA),  rat  (AC91AA)  and  rabbit  (SEP-2021-011-
PHH1V) found no effect of PHH-1 or PHH-1V vaccines on these organs. 
Also, no effects on fertility have been described for the SQBA adjuvant, 
using an analogous adjuvant, at least at the dose to be used in BIMERVAX 
vaccine.  Moreover,  no  effects  on  fertility  have  been  associated  to  the 
development  of  immunogenicity  against  SARS-CoV-2  during  the 
development of other four COVID-19 vaccines currently approved (SmPC 
Comirnaty,  2021;  SmPC  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen,  2021;  SmPC 
Spikevax,  2021;  SmPC  Vaxzevria,  2021;  SmPC  Nuvaxovid,  2022). 
Animal  studies  do  not  indicate  direct  or  indirect  harmful  effects  with 
respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition, or post-
natal  development.  Administration  of  BIMERVAX  vaccine  in  pregnancy 
should  only  be  considered  when  the  potential  benefits  outweigh  any 
potential  risks  for  the  mother  and  foetus.  It  is  unknown  whether 
BIMERVAX vaccine is excreted in human milk. 
Anticipated 
Targeted populations of the indication will include women of childbearing 
risk/consequence of the 
potential, thus, the use of BIMERVAX in pregnant and/or breastfeeding 
missing information 
women will occur.

Missing information: Use in immunocompromised patients 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Subjects with immunosuppressive conditions or medications were to be 
to the medicine 
excluded from the study in the BIMERVAX clinical development program. 
There is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving 
BIMERVAX will be different to that of the general population, but given 
the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be ruled out. 
Anticipated 
As  the  vaccines  weakened  immune  system  may  not  reach  a  sufficient 
risk/consequence of the 
response, vaccines may be less effective in individuals with compromised 
missing information 
immune  function  due  to  acquired  or  genetic  conditions  or  conditions

Missing information: Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g., chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular 
disorders) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
BIMERVAX  has  not  been  studied  in  frail  individuals  with  severe 
to the medicine 
comorbidities  that  may  compromise  immune  function  due  to  the 
condition or treatment of the condition. Frail patients with comorbidities 
(e.g.,  COPD,  diabetes  mellitus,  chronic  neurological  disease, 
cardiovascular  disorders)  are  potentially  at  risk  of  developing  a  more 
severe manifestation of COVID-19. There is no evidence that the safety 
profile of this population receiving BIMERVAX will be different to that of 
the  general  population,  but  given  the  scarcity  of  data,  the  possibility 
cannot be ruled out. 
Anticipated 
In general, there is a potential that frail participants with unstable health 
risk/consequence of the 
conditions and co-morbidities may experience a different outcome than 
missing information 
achieved in healthy individuals administered vaccines.

Missing information: Interaction with other vaccines 
Evidence for linking the risk 
BIMERVAX is indicated as a booster in individuals vaccinated against 
to the medicine 
COVID 19 with mRNA vaccines. The safety and immunogenicity of a 
booster vaccination with BIMERVAX against SARS-CoV-2 in healthy adult 
volunteers fully vaccinated against COVID 19, is being evaluated in the 
Phase IIb clinical study HIPRA-HH-2 and Phase III study HIPRA-HH-5. 
Studies to determine if co-administration of BIMERVAX with other 
vaccines (i.e., with seasonal illness vaccines [such as the influenza 
vaccines]) may affect the efficacy or safety of either vaccine have not 
been performed. 
Anticipated 
There  is  the  theoretical  question  as  whether  vaccines  may  interact  with 
risk/consequence of the 
each other and change the immune response to either vaccine or induce 
missing information 
safety  concerns.  It  is  common  medical  practice  to  administer  vaccines 
concurrently.  Participants  receiving  BIMERVAX  may  be  administered 
seasonal flu vaccines during the vaccination period of the pandemic.

Missing information: Long-term safety 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Understanding  of  the  long-term  safety  profile  of  BIMERVAX  is  currently 
to the medicine 
limited. Nevertheless, per protocols, the clinical development program has 
a safety follow up period of 48 weeks in Phase I/IIa clinical study HIPRA-HH-
1, up to 52 weeks after booster vaccination in the Phase IIb clinical study 
HIPRA-HH-2, up to 26 weeks in the Phase III study HIPRA-HH-5, up to 26 
weeks in the Phase IIb HIPRA-HH-10 study, up to 52 weeks in the Phase III 
study  HIPRA-HH-4  and  up  to  24  weeks  in  the  supportive  Phase  IIb  study 
HAN-01. 
Anticipated 
At the time of vaccine availability, the long-term safety of BIMERVAX is not 
risk/consequence of the 
fully known. Although there are currently no known risks with a potentially 
missing information 
late onset, given the limited data, the possibility cannot be excluded. Data 
will continue to be collected from participants in ongoing studies.

II.C.2 Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
Study: HIPRA-HH-1 
Purpose of the study: The primary objective of this study is to assess safety and tolerability of BIMERVAX 
vaccine in healthy adult volunteers. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity measured 
by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to 
the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, T-cell mediated response against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein 
and Th-1/Th-2 T-cell mediated responses against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein after the second dose 
of COVID-19 HIPRA vaccine. 
Study: HIPRA-HH-2 
Purpose of the study: 
 Part A: The primary objectives of this study are to determine and compare the changes of the 
immunogenicity measured by pseudovirus neutralisation against Wuhan strain (also known as L strain) 
at Baseline and Day 14, after HIPRA’s vaccine (PHH-1V) versus subjects who have received complete 
vaccination,  including  homologous  booster,  with  the  Comirnaty  vaccine  at  least  182  days  and  with  a 
maximum of 365 days before booster vaccination, and to assess the safety and tolerability of PHH-1V as 
a booster dose in healthy adult subjects fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with the Comirnaty vaccine.  
Part B: The primary objectives of this study are to determine and compare the changes in the 
immunogenicity measured by PBNA against omicron BA.1 subvariant, at Day 14 post-dose 4 of PHH-1V 
in cohort 2 versus post-dose 3 in cohort 2, and to assess the safety and tolerability of PHH-1V as a fourth 
dose in adult subjects in cohort 1 and 2. 
Study: HIPRA-HH-5 
Purpose of the study: The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of PHH-
1V  as  a  booster  dose  in  healthy  adult  subjects  vaccinated  against  COVID-19  with  the  Comirnaty, 
Spikevax, Vaxzevria or Janssen vaccines. And to determine and compare the changes of immunogenicity 
measured  by  pseudovirus  neutralisation  against  Wuhan  strain  (also  known  as  L  strain)  and  against 
Omicron, and any other relevant Variants of Concern (VOC) in the epidemiologic moment,  after booster 
of HIPRA’s vaccine (PHH-1V) in a subset of participants; To evaluate the immunogenicity measured by 
means  of  total  antibody  against  Receptor  Binding  Domain  of  the  Spike  protein  of  SARS-CoV-2 
quantification,  measured  by  an  electrochemiluminescence  immunoassay  (ECLIA),  after  booster  of 
HIPRA’s vaccine in a subset of participants.

Emulsion for injection 
Study: HIPRA-HH-10 
Purpose of the study: The primary objectives of this study are to determine and compare the changes 
of the immunogenicity measured by pseudovirus neutralisation against Omicron strain at Baseline and 
Day 14, in subjects who have received two doses of Vaxzevria vaccine and PHH-1V as a booster, versus 
subjects who have received two doses of Vaxzevria and Comirnaty as a booster, at least 91 days and 
with  a  maximum  of  365  days  before  day  0;  and  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  PHH-1V  as  a 
booster  dose  in  healthy  adult  subjects  vaccinated  against  COVID-19  with  the  Vaxzevria  or  Janssen 
vaccine. The secondary objectives include to determine and compare the changes of the immunogenicity 
measured by SARS-CoV-2 PBNA against the Variants of Concern (VOC) Beta and Delta, in subjects who 
have received two doses of Vaxzevria vaccine and HIPRA vaccine as a booster versus subjects who have 
received two vaccinations with the Vaxzevria and Comirnaty as a booster; To determine and compare 
the changes of the immunogenicity measured by SARS-CoV-2 PBNA against Omicron in both cohorts; 
To  determine  and  compare  the  changes  of  the  immunogenicity  measured  by  wild  type  SARS-CoV-2 
neutralisation test (VNA) against Omicron in a subset of 20% of both cohorts of the study; To evaluate 
the immunogenicity measured by means of total antibody against Receptor Binding Domain of the Spike 
protein of SARS-CoV-2 quantification, measured by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) 
in subjects of both cohorts. 
Study: HAN-01 
Purpose of the study: The primary objective of this study is to assess safety and tolerability of BIMERVAX 
vaccine in healthy adult volunteers. Safety will be measured by solicited and unsolicited reactions (local 
and  systemic)  following  each  dose  vaccination.  The  secondary  objectives  are  to  evaluate  the 
immunogenicity  measured  by  wild-type  SARS-CoV-2  and  SARS-CoV-2  pseudovirus  neutralization  at 
long-term; To evaluate the immunogenicity measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. 
Study: HIPRA-HH-4;  
Purpose of the study: The primary objective of this study to determine and compare the changes of the 
immunogenicity  measured  by  pseudovirus  (or  live  virus  for  the  HIV  cohort)  neutralization  against 
Omicron, Beta and Delta any other relevant Variants of Concern (VOC) in the epidemiologic moment, 
after  administration  of  HIPRA’s  vaccine  (PHH-1V).  The  secondary  objectives  are  to  determine  and 
compare the changes of the immunogenicity measured by pseudovirus (or live virus for the HIV cohort) 
neutralization against Omicron, Beta and Delta and any other relevant Variants of Concern (VOC) in the 
epidemiologic moment at long term after administration of HIPRA’s vaccine (PHH-1V). To evaluate the 
immunogenicity  measured  by  means  of  total  antibody  against  Receptor  Binding  Domain  of  the  Spike 
protein of SARS-CoV-2 quantification, measured by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) 
after administration of HIPRA’s vaccine (PHH-1V). To assess the safety and tolerability of PHH-1V as an 
additional   dose in adult individuals with pre-existing immunosuppressive conditions.

BIMERVAX vaccine. The comparative safety study uses two different designs: a cohort design to estimate 
the  effect  of  BIMERVAX  vaccine  on  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  compared  with  that  of 
other COVID-19 vaccines authorised for the booster indication; and a self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) 
study (a subtype of the self-controlled case series design) design to estimate the effect of the COVID-
19 HIPRA vaccine booster on selected AESIs compared with no COVID-19 vaccine as a booster. 
Study:  Post-authorisation  safety  study  of  the  COVID-19  Vaccines  International  Pregnancy 
Exposure Registry (C-VIPER) 
Purpose of the study: This study aims to estimate the risk of obstetric outcomes (spontaneous abortion, 
antenatal  bleeding,  gestational  diabetes,  gestational  hypertension,  intrauterine  growth  restriction, 
postpartum  hemorrhage,  fetal  distress,  uterine  rupture,  placenta  previa,  chorioamnionitis,  Caesarean 
delivery,  COVID-19),  neonatal  outcomes  (major  congenital  malformations,  low  birth  weight,  neonatal 
death,  neonatal  encephalopathy,  neonatal  infections,  neonatal  acute  kidney  injury,  preterm  birth, 
respiratory distress in the newborn, small for gestational age, stillbirth, COVID-19), and infant outcomes 
(developmental  milestones  [motor,  cognitive,  language,  social-emotional,  and  mental  health  skills], 
height, weight, failure to thrive, medical conditions during the first 12 months of life, COVID-19) among 
pregnant  women  exposed  to  single  (homologous)  or  mixed  (heterologous)  BIMERVAX  series  from  30 
days prior to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) to end of pregnancy and their offspring 
relative to a matched reference group who received no COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy. 
Study: Post-authorisation effectiveness study of BIMERVAX emulsion for injection in Europe 
in VAC4EU 
Purpose  of  the  study:  this  study  will  estimate  the  effect  of  the  BIMERVAX  on  COVID-19–related 
outcomes—i.e., COVID-19  infection,  COVID-19–related  hospitalisations  or  emergency  department 
visits—compared with other COVID-19 vaccines authorised for the booster indication.

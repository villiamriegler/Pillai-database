2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Methotrexate  (MTX)  has  been  used  extensively  for  the  treatment  of  cancer  (particularly  acute  lymphoblastic 
leukaemia [ALL]) since the mid-1950s following authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 
1953 and has been authorised in the EU  since the  1960s. The authorised indications for MTX  have  since been 
extended  beyond  cancer  to  include  treatment  of  autoimmune  and  inflammatory  diseases:  adult  rheumatoid 
arthritis  (RA),  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA)  and  psoriasis.  All  of  these  indications  are  chronic  debilitating/ 
life-threatening illnesses requiring long-term treatment. 
Thus, MTX is a well-established drug which has been used safely and effectively in humans for over 50 years in the 
European Union (EU). It is currently authorised for long-term use in children and adults by oral and parenteral 
routes of administration. 
In addition to its use for adult RA and psoriasis, oral MTX plays a pivotal role in the treatment of children with ALL 
and JIA. However, the only oral presentations authorised and marketed in the  community  currently  are  tablets 
Assessment report  - Jylamvo 
EMA/78284/2017  
Page 6/33 
  
  
 
 
available  in  2.5mg,  5mg  and  10mg  strengths.  The  majority  of  children  less  than  12  years  old  (and  many 
adolescents  and  adults)  cannot  swallow  tablets.  In  addition,  the  authorised  doses  necessitate  that  MTX  is 
administered  to  children  at  doses  related  to  their body size.  As  a  consequence  tablets  have  to  be  split  and/or 
crushed,  exposing  the  carer  and  environment  to  cytotoxics  and  providing  inaccurate  dosing.  Alternatively 
unlicensed liquid  formulations,  prepared  extemporaneously  or  as  ready-prepared  ‘specials’,  are  prescribed  and 
dispensed.  This  unlicensed  use  potentially  exposes  children  to  medication  errors,  inappropriate  excipients and 
the consequential higher risk of adverse reactions or inadequate efficacy. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Methotrexate Oral Solution has been developed as an alternative oral presentation to the authorised tablet form. 
The formulation has been developed primarily for use in children (but can also be used in adolescents and adults 
unable to swallow tablets) and account has been taken of the EMA guideline on pharmaceutical development of 
medicines  for  paediatric  use:  EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012  Rev.  1.  The  formulation  contains  the  following 
excipients: Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 400, Glycerol, Orange flavour, Sucralose, Ethyl parahydroxybenzoate (E214), 
Sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219), Citric acid, Tri-sodium citrate and Purified water. The liquid will be 
administered with an oral dosing syringe which will allow administration of accurate doses (based on body surface 
area). 
The proposed indications were: 
Jylamvo is for use in adults, adolescents and children aged 3 years and over. 
In rheumatological and dermatological diseases 
•  Active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients. 
• 
Polyarthritic forms of severe, active juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) when the response to non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been inadequate. 
•  Severe, treatment-refractory, disabling psoriasis, which does not respond sufficiently to other forms of 
treatment such as phototherapy, PUVA therapy and retinoids, and severe psoriatic arthritis in adult 
patients. 
In malignant tumours and haemoblastosis 
Malignant tumours and haemoblastosis as part of a polychemotherapy regimen insofar as oral treatment is 
indicated. 
The name of the medicinal product was changed during the procedure from Methotrexate Therakind 2 mg/ml Oral 
Solution to Jylamvo. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
Jylamvo is presented as an oral solution containing 2 mg/ml of methotrexate as the active substance.

Other ingredients of the oral solution are polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400, glycerol, sucralose, ethyl 
parahydroxybenzoate (E214), sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219), orange flavour, citric acid 
monohydrate, tri-sodium citrate and purified water. 
The product is available in amber type III glass bottles with tamper evident child-resistant closures. Each pack 
contains one bottle, an LDPE bottle adaptor and a white polypropylene dosing syringe, as described in section 
6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of methotrexate is (S)-2-[4-[[(2,4-diaminopteridin-6-yl)methyl]methylamino]- 
benzoylamino]-pentanedioic acid corresponding to the molecular formula C20H22N8O5. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 454.4 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1 Structure of methotrexate. 
As there is a monograph of methotrexate in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active 
substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for methotrexate 
which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
The active substance appears as an orange or yellow, crystalline, hygroscopic powder, practically insoluble in 
water and alcohol, freely soluble in dilute solutions of alkali hydroxides and carbonates and slightly soluble in 6N 
hydrochloric acid. Its pKa was found to be 4.7 and its partition co-efficient -1.85. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The information regarding manufacturing process steps and in-process controls, characterisation, control of 
materials and of critical steps and intermediates, process validation, manufacturing process development and 
packaging material is covered by the CEP. The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before 
issuing the Certificate of Suitability.  
Specification 
The active substance specification complies with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. monograph. 
The CEP includes an additional control for the residual solvent ethanol which is performed by GC. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used has been provided. 
Batch analyses data for three batches were provided. The results are consistent from batch to batch and comply 
with the specification in all cases.

Stability 
The proposed re-test period of 5 years and packaging material for methotrexate are covered by the CEP. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an oral solution containing 2 mg/ml of methotrexate as the active substance.   
The aim of the pharmaceutical development programme was to design a palatable multi-dose oral liquid 
formulation of methotrexate, suitable for dosing to paediatric patients and bioequivalent to a currently licensed 
methotrexate product, Ebetrexat 10mg tablets. Jylamvo was developed as an orange flavoured, preserved, oral 
liquid in a 60 ml presentation with an oral dosing syringe 10 ml. The composition of the orange flavouring has 
been provided. 
The initial pre-formulation studies aimed to establish a suitable pH for the formulated finished product, optimise 
the antibacterial preservative agents and identifying suitable solvents and buffer. 
The subsequent formulation studies investigated a range of formulations that optimised the concentration of the 
buffer systems and solvents whilst investigating any compatibility issues with the flavourings and sweeteners. 
Satisfactory justifications regarding the inclusion of buffer components, co-solvents and preservatives in the 
formulation were provided. A further study was conducted, confirming the palatability of the formulation 
(bioequivalence clinical study [MTX001]. Sufficient information regarding the suitability and safety of the 
selected orange flavouring for use in pharmaceutical products, when administered via the oral route, was 
provided. 
Jylamvo is an aqueous based multi-dose product and therefore a preservative was included in order to maintain 
the microbiological integrity of the product during its shelf life for both the unopened bottle and during use.  The 
effectiveness of the preservatives has been demonstrated via the preservative efficacy test outlined by 
Ph. Eur. 5.1.3. 
Jylamvo is packed in a 75 ml amber glass bottle (containing 60 ml extractable volume of solution) and closed 
with a child-resistant cap. The packaging materials comply with the current EU relevant regulations. The child 
resistance feature of the caps complies with EN ISO 8317. The bottle is presented in a carton containing a bottle 
neck adaptor and a 10 ml white polypropylene oral dosing CE marked syringe. The accuracy of withdrawn dose 
was studied with the proposed syringe. All results at each dose level, met the criteria of less than 10% variation. 
Therefore, the syringe is deemed suitable for use across the entire dosing range. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process can be considered as a standard process which comprises the following main steps: 
dissolving the active substance and excipients in a buffer solution through successive steps of addition, 
dissolution and homogenization. Prior to filling the pH is adjusted and the solution is filtered before being filled 
into bottles which are then sealed with a cap. 
The manufacturing process and equipment is satisfactorily described. Critical steps have been defined and the 
applied in-process controls are adequate and justified. The proposed holding time of bulk solution was justified. 
Assessment report  - Jylamvo 
EMA/78284/2017  
Page 9/33 
  
  
 
 
The process has been validated with three pilot scale batches manufactured using the mixing principles intended 
for commercial production. All three batches have been monitored in the formal ICH stability programme and 
one of them has been used for the pivotal clinical study. The process has subsequently been optimised and 
scaled from the pilot scale to the intended commercial scale. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. Production 
scale validation batches of Jylamvo will be manufactured and tested according to the proposed process 
validation protocol which is acceptable since the process is a standard one and the validation protocol is 
considered adequate. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance (visual), identification (UPLC retention time and UV), assay (UPLC), related substances (UPLC), 
preservative identity (UPLC), sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate assay (UPLC), ethyl parahydroxybenzoate 
assay (UPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), preservative efficacy (at shelf life: Ph. Eur.), uniformity of mass of delivered dose 
from multi-dose container (Ph. Eur.), fill volume (weight), relative density (Ph. Eur.) and microbial purity (Ph. 
Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods have been 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used in the routine analysis of finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on five pilot scale batches and two commercial scale batches were presented. All batches are 
representative of the commercial formula and process and meet the specification limits. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot scale batch of finished product stored for up to 24 months at 5 ºC, 25 ºC / 
60% RH, up to 12 months at 30 ºC / 60% RH and for 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  Results on one smaller laboratory scale batch stored for 24 
months at 5 ºC  and 25 ºC / 60%RH and 6 months at 40 ºC / 75% RH were also provided. The stability batches 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance, methotrexate assay, related substances, sodium methyl 
parahydroxybenzoate assay, ethyl parahydroxybenzoate assay, pH, microbial purity and preservative efficacy 
testing. The methods used were the same as for release testing and are stability indicating. The results indicate 
that the samples stored at 5 ºC and 25 ºC / 60% RH complied with specification at all time-points tested. No 
trends were observed. However, data from two batches showed out of specification results for an individual 
impurity at the 12 month time-point in samples stored at 30 ºC / 60% RH; all other parameters complied with 
the specification. In addition, all batches stored at 40 ºC / 75% RH gave out of specification results for assay, 
related substances and preservative assay at the 6 month time-point (two batches at 3 months). Based on these 
findings appropriate storage conditions have been proposed (SmPC section 6.4). 
In-use stability testing was performed on two pilot-scale batches stored at 25 °C / 60% RH for 3 months. The 
protocol utilised is identical for both batches, one at the beginning of the proposed shelf life and a second 
towards the end of it. The following parameters were evaluated: appearance, pH, methotrexate assay, related 
substances, sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate assay, ethyl parahydroxybenzoate assay and microbial 
purity. No significant changes were observed to any of the measured parameters over the 3 months’ testing for 
the first batch.  
Assessment report  - Jylamvo 
EMA/78284/2017  
Page 10/33 
  
  
 
The in-use stability study with the second batch was initiated following storage at ambient conditions for 20 
months, the originally proposed shelf life being 24 months at the time. The results for appearance, pH, 
methotrexate assay, preservative assay and microbial purity all remained within specification throughout the 
duration of the study and support the proposed in-use shelf life of 3 months. However, the results for 
methotrexate assay, preservative assay and related substance were already close to the specification limit when 
this study was initiated. Although the data for methotrexate assay and preservative assay remained within 
specification, the data generated for an individual impurity and consequently total impurities was just above the 
proposed limits. Consequently the proposed shelf life was limited from 24 to 20 months. Although the in-use 
study has been conducted beyond the proposed shelf life of 20 months, the data continue to support the 
proposed in-use shelf life of 3 months as there is very little change in any of the parameters investigated over 
the period of the study. 
The photostability studies were performed on one laboratory-scale batch of Jylamvo exposed to UV light for 3 
months. The following parameters were evaluated: appearance, pH, assay and related substances. Results 
showed no change in the appearance or pH of the solution. However, there was a decrease in assay and a 
corresponding increase in related substances. After 3 months direct intense UV light, Jylamvo just fails the 
specification for an individual impurity. However, the data also demonstrate that the primary packaging 
provides sufficient protection from light. Photostability studies have also been conducted on one pilot scale batch 
in line with the guidance set out by ICH Q1B and demonstrated that the product is light sensitive but  also that 
a type III amber glass bottle provides sufficient protection. 
Based on the overall data presented, the revised shelf life of 20 months, the proposed in-use shelf life of 3 
months and the proposed storage conditions “Do not store above 25ºC” and “Keep the bottle tightly closed”, as 
mentioned in the SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4, are supported.  
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used 
to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant 
material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology 
The MTX oral solution has been developed as a hybrid generic presentation with reference to both an authorised 
injection (originator) and oral tablet formulation. The Applicant has not conducted any new non-clinical studies. 
Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist, is an established antineoplastic agent and immunosuppressant drug that 
has been used safely and effectively in humans for over 50 years in the European Union (EU) and USA. The 
pharmacology, toxicity, kinetics and clinical adverse effects of methotrexate following oral and systemic 
administration are well known.  
For the nonclinical overview of methotrexate and the excipients in the oral solution, reference has been made to 
relevant published scientific literature and pharmacological monographs, to provide an integrated and critical 
assessment. 
The non-clinical overview provided by the applicant was consistent with the known pharmacological, 
pharmacokinetic and toxicological profile of methotrexate. The toxicological documentation on the active 
ingredient and formulation excipients is considered to be satisfactory and does not raise any new concerns.

The Phase I PECsurfacewater of Methotrexate was calculated according the EMA guideline formula. It exceeds the 
action limit of 0.01 µg/L (PEC=0.021 µg/L for a DOSEai of 4.29 mg/day). A standard Phase II fate and effects 
assessment was not performed by the applicant. 
The  ERA  results  inserted  in  this  application  demonstrated  an  adsorption  coefficient  K oc≤10  000  L/Kg,  a  not 
readily biodegradable capacity, a BCF of 3.162, a log Kow ≤3 and ≤4.5 and acute toxicological values of EC50 
≥10 mg / L. 
A  refined  PECsurfacewater  was  performed  by  the  applicant  for  the  following  indications:  rheumatoid  arthritis, 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Different Fpen were calculated 
for each indication, assuming the highest prevalence values of different diseases.  
The refined PEC for the different indications was calculated for the different indications: A) Rheumatoid Arthritis 
= 0.0059 μg/L; B) Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis = 0.0086 μg/L; C) Psoriasis = 0.0051 μg/L; D) Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) = 0.00019 μg/L, resulting in a total refined PEC of 0.01979 = 0.02 μg/L, well 
above the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. Despite the substance has a Log Kow of -1.28 not being PBT, it could reach 
the surface water and be toxic for the water species. 
The Applicant did not carry out a Phase II environmental fate and chronic effect analysis based on relevant 
published scientific literature. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of Jylamvo manufactured by 
Therakind Limited is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for 
all methotrexate containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the 
ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
However, as Methotrexate is a cytotoxic substance the applicant followed the request of the CHMP to include the 
following sentence into SmPC (point 6.6) and package leaflet (point 5): “Any unused product or waste should be 
disposed of in accordance with local requirements for cytotoxic products”. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Methotrexate was provided and was accepted by 
the CHMP. No additional non clinical studies are considered necessary.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for Jylamvo containing methotrexate. To support the marketing authorisation application 
the applicant conducted 2 bioequivalence studies with cross-over design. These studies were the pivotal studies.

No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its current version is of 
particular relevance. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Clinical studies 
The MTX has been developed as a hybrid generic product with reference to Methotrexat "Lederle" 25 mg/ml i.v. 
– Stechampulle, (Pfizer Corporation Austria Ges.m.b.H., 1210 Wien). Demonstration of bioequivalence against 
the reference product was not feasible due to the differences in formulation (injection vs oral solution). Thus the 
applicant provided two bioequivalence (BE) studies to bridge to the clinical data and Product Information. 
MTX002 compared Jylamvo against Methotrexate “Lederle” 2.5 mg tablets, which belongs to the same global 
marketing authorisation as the originator injectable product (Methotrexat “Lederle" 25 mg/ml – Stechampulle) 
and MTX001 compared the oral bioavailability of the 2 mg/mL oral solution with the hybrid product Ebetrexat® 
10 mg tablets to provide additional data in support of the oncological indication claimed.

Methods 
Study design  
The  bioequivalence  study  [MTX001]  was  conducted  to  compare  plasma  concentrations  of,  methotrexate 
2 mg/ml oral solution with the hybrid product, Ebetrexat® 10 mg tablets. The study design was a single-dose, 
randomised, two-period crossover study with a wash-out period of 7 days between doses of methotrexate. 
The study comprised: 
•  Screening period of maximum 21 days; 
• 
Two treatment periods (each of which included a profile period of 72 hours) separated by a wash-out 
period of 7 calendar days between consecutive administrations of the Investigational Medicinal Product 
(IMP); 
•  A post-study visit within 14 to 21 calendar days after the last administration of IMP. 
Participants were randomly assigned to treatment sequence, prior to the first administration of IMP. 
Each treatment period included a profile period of 72 hours, which commenced with morning dosing of IMP on 
a 24 hour clinic stay at the study centre. 
Participants were admitted to the study centre approximately 11.5 hours before dosing to ensure an overnight 
fast  of  at  least  10 hours.  Participants  received  either  the  test  or  reference  product  per  treatment  period, 
according to the randomisation schedule, under fasting conditions. Participants received each product once and 
were asked to comment on the taste of the test oral solution. Participants were allowed to leave the study centre 
24 hours after administration of IMP, providing they returned for the subsequent blood sample collections. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples were collected at the following times: pre dose and post dose at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 
1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.33, 2.67, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours (total number of samples per 
treatment  period: 23).  Safety  assessments  included adverse  events  (AEs),  vital  signs,  haematology,  clinical 
chemistry and urinalysis. 
24 healthy volunteers were planned for inclusion to complete the study with 20 evaluable subjects. Since no 
drop-outs  occurred,  all  24  subjects  were  analysed.  Inclusion  criteria  and  details  on  the  test  and  reference 
products were also provided. 
All  subjects  received  a  single  10 mg  oral  dose  of  methotrexate  (either  as  5 ml  of  2 mg/ml  oral  solution  or 
1 tablet) in each of the two treatment periods, separated by a wash-out period of 7 calendar days.  
Test and reference products  
Methotrexate 2 mg/mL oral solution (Batch no. THE/13/0103, 100.1%) has been compared to Ebetrexat 10mg 
tablets (Batch no. DL6270, 99.5%). 
Population studied   
Twenty-four (24) adult healthy volunteers were screened and entered into the study. All subjects completed

both treatment phases. 
Analytical methods   
The  plasma  samples  of  subjects  were  analysed  using  a  validated  LC-MS/MS  method  for  methotrexate.  The 
procedures provided in the standard operating procedures of the Bioanalytical Services Division (BASD) were 
followed  during  the  performance  of  the  method  validation  and  study  sample  analysis.  Independent  quality 
assurance audits (i.e. facility-, process- and study-based) were performed. 
Analytical method, VAL 258/01, was validated in accordance with internationally accepted standards as outlined 
in the FDA and EMA guidelines on bioanalytical method validation, as well as the procedures provided in the 
standard operating procedures of the Bioanalytical Services Division (BASD). 
At the time of validation, the analytical method was shown to provide an acceptable degree of accuracy and 
precision over the concentration range 1.563 – 800.0 ng/ml based on peak area ratios with a linear calibration 
curve (y = mx + b) weighted by 1/concentration. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
Primary PK Parameters 
•  Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) 
•  Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero to t, where t is the time of 
the last quantifiable concentration (AUC(0-t)) 
Secondary PK Parameters 
•  AUC with extrapolation to infinity (AUC(0-∞)) 
• 
Time to Cmax (tmax) 
• 
Percentage of the AUC0-∞ obtained by extrapolation (%AUCex) 
• 
Terminal elimination rate constant (λz) 
•  Apparent terminal elimination half-life (t ½). 
Safety Variables: 
Medical history, demographic and anthropometric data, haematology, clinical chemistry, serology, urinalysis, 
AEs, concomitant medication, drugs of abuse and tobacco screen, alcohol breath test, vital signs, ECGs, physical 
examination. 
Statistical methods   
The test product was compared to the reference product by means of statistical analysis with respect to the 
primary PK parameters (Cmax and AUC0-t) using an analysis of variance with sequence, subject(sequence), 
product and period effects after logarithmic transformation of the data. 
Conventional bioequivalence limits (80.00% to 125.00%) were pre-defined in the study protocol. 
Results 
Data from 24 evaluable subjects were analysed. There was no carry-over effect of methotrexate between the 
two treatment periods with all pre-dose values in Treatment-period 2 recorded as zero.

Safety data 
Nine  (9)  subjects  had  a  total  of  13  AEs  during  the  study.  Three  of  the  events  (nausea,  pre-syncope  and 
diarrhoea) were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to the study drug (reference tablet) and 10 
as not related to the study drug. All AEs were of mild intensity. No SAEs were reported during this study and 
none of the AEs were of severe intensity. No AEs related to laboratory variables were reported. No subjects 
withdrew or were withdrawn from the study. 
Assessment report  - Jylamvo 
EMA/78284/2017  
Page 19/33 
  
  
 
 
 
None of the laboratory findings found to be marginally outside the reference ranges was reported as AEs. Pulse 
rate and blood pressure remained essentially unchanged throughout the study. Body temperature before dosing 
on clinic days ranged between 35.8°C and 37.6°C, and no subjects were withdrawn due to pathologically raised 
body temperature. No clinically relevant abnormal 12-lead ECG results were reported for any of the subjects. No 
abnormalities were observed in any of the subjects during physical examination. The test product (oral solution) 
is palatable. 
Conclusions 
This study met the bioequivalence criteria as all 90% geometric confidence intervals were within the predefined 
acceptance range. 
Both formulations were well tolerated, with no major side effects and no important differences in safety profiles 
were observed between the treatments, particularly with respect to the number and pattern of adverse events. 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Jylamvo is considered bioequivalent with Ebetrexat® 10 mg 
tablets. 
MTX002 
Methods 
Study design  
The bioequivalence study MTX002 was a single center, single-dose, open-label, laboratory-blind, randomized, 
two-period, two-sequence crossover study to determine the bioequivalence of an oral solution (2 mg/ml) and 
tablet formulation containing 2.5 mg methotrexate in at least 20 healthy male subjects under fasting conditions. 
Each treatment period included a profile period of 72 hours. Subjects were admitted to the study center 
approximately 11.5 hours before dosing to ensure an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. Subjects received 
either the test or reference product per treatment period, according to the randomization schedule, under 
fasting conditions. The two treatment periods were separated by a wash-out period of 8 calendar days. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples were collected at the following times: pre-dose (0 hours) and at 15 minutes, 30 
minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1 hour 15 minutes, 1 hour 30 minutes, 1 hour 45 minutes, 2 hours, 2 hours 20 
minutes, 2 hours 40 minutes, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, 16 hours, 24 
hours, 36 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours post-dose (total samples: 23). 
Test and reference products  
Methotrexate 2 mg/mL oral solution (Batch no. THE/13/0103, 100.1%) has been compared to Methotrexate 
“Lederle” 2.5 mg tablets (Batch no. C750B, 99.4%).

Population(s) studied   
Twenty-four (24) healthy male subjects were enrolled to ensure completion of at least 20 evaluable subjects. All 
24 subjects completed the study as per protocol. 
Analytical methods   
Quantitative analysis of methotrexate in the collected plasma samples were performed by the Bioanalytical 
Services Division (BASD) using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 
The analytical laboratories of BASD have been inspected for their compliance with GLP, based on the OECD 
guidelines ENV/MC/CHEM (98)17 revised 1997. These inspections have confirmed that the laboratory was able 
to successfully apply GLP principles in studies that were performed at BASD. Analytical methods had been 
validated according to internationally accepted standards (as per EMA guidelines for Bioanalytical Method 
Validation).

effects after logarithmic transformation of the data. Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for the 
"test/reference" geometric mean ratios of these primary PK parameters were tabulated. 
Bioequivalence of the test and reference products was assessed on the basis of the 90% confidence intervals for 
estimates of the geometric mean ratios between the primary PK parameters of the test and reference products 
using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) in relation to the conventional bioequivalence range of 80.00% to 
125.00%. 
Results 
The data listings, descriptive statistics, statistical analysis and graphs of this study were generated using 
SAS/STAT® and SAS/GRAPH® software.

The median t max was 0.76 hours and 0.75 hours for the reference and the test products, respectively, and was 
not statistically significantly different between the two products. 
Safety data 
Study medication was well tolerated by all subjects in this study. No AEs, deaths or SAEs were reported and no 
subjects were withdrawn due to AEs. Electrocardiogram evaluations performed at screening and at post-study,

were compatible with expectations for a healthy male population. There was no clinically significant and/or 
consistent drug-related change in vital signs, physical findings or safety laboratory values after oral 
administration of 2.5 mg methotrexate per treatment period. Laboratory tests found to be marginally outside 
the reference ranges were considered not to be of clinical relevance. 
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Jylamvo is considered bioequivalent with Methotrexate “Lederle” 
2.5 mg tablets. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  presented.  The  applicant  has  provided  a  detailed  discussion  of  the 
mechanism of action of methotrexate in the treatment of neoplastic diseases, RA, JIA and psoriasis, based on 
data from the literature.  
Methotrexate  is  a  folic  acid  antagonist  that,  as  an  antimetabolite,  belongs  to  the  class  of  cytotoxic  active 
substances.  It  acts  by  competitive  inhibition  of  the  enzyme  dihydrofolate  reductase  and  thus  inhibits  DNA 
synthesis. 
It  has  not  yet  been  possible  to  date  to  clarify  whether  the  efficacy  of  methotrexate  in  the  management  of 
psoriasis,  psoriatic  arthritis  and  chronic  polyarthritis 
is  due  either  to  an  anti-inflammatory  or 
immunosuppressive  effect,  or  to  what  extent  a  methotrexate-induced  increase  in  extracellular  adenosine 
concentration at inflamed sites contributes to this effect. 
Highly proliferating tissue such as malignant cells, bone marrow, foetal cells, skin epithelium and mucosa is 
generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. Cell proliferation is usually greater in malignant tumours 
than in normal tissue and methotrexate can therefore exert a sustained effect on malignant growth without 
causing irreversible damage to normal tissue. 
In psoriasis, cell proliferation of the epithelium is markedly increased compared with normal skin. This difference 
in cell proliferation rate is the starting point for the use of methotrexate in particularly severe, generalised, 
treatment-resistant psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. At time of the submission the medicinal product has not been marketed 
in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  Jylamvo  has  been  developed  as  a  hybrid  generic  product  with  reference  to  an  authorised  injection 
(originator: Methotrexat "Lederle" 25 mg – Stechampulle, of Pfizer Corporation Austria Ges.m.b.H., 1210 Wien); 
reference  was  also  made  to  an  oral  tablet  (hybrid) formulation  (Ebetrexat®  10  mg  tablets,  EBEWE  Pharma 
Ges.m.b.H. Nfg. KG, 4866 Unterach, Austria).  
The  Applicant  has  not  conducted  any  new  clinical  efficacy/safety  study.  To  support  this  application,  two 
bioequivalence studies were conducted using two different products. MTX001 compared the oral bioavailability 
Assessment report  - Jylamvo 
EMA/78284/2017  
Page 23/33 
  
  
 
 
of the 2 mg/mL oral solution with the hybrid product Ebetrexat® 10 mg tablets. MTX002 compared the proposed 
oral  solution  with  Methotrexate  “Lederle”  2.5  mg  tablets,  which  belongs  to  the  same  global  marketing 
authorisation as the originator injectable product (Methotrexat “Lederle" 25 mg/ml – Stechampulle). 
Both  studies  met  the  bioequivalence  criteria  as  all  90%  geometric  confidence  intervals  were  within  the 
predefined acceptance range of 80.00-125.00 %:

In each study, both Test and Reference formulations were well tolerated. No major side effects and no important 
differences in safety profiles were observed between the treatments. 
As Bioequivalence was demonstrated between the proposed new formulation – Jylamvo – and the two marketed 
products for oral administration, the absence of new data on methotrexate ADME in the target population and its 
potential for drug-drug interactions is acceptable. 
Methotrexate is an established drug which has been used in humans for over 50 years in the European Union 
(EU).  It  is  currently  authorised  for  long-term  use  in  children  and  adults  by  oral  and  parenteral  routes  of 
administration.  In  the  clinical  overview  of  methotrexate  and  the  oral  solution,  reference  has  been  made  to 
relevant published scientific literature (pharmacological monographs and peer-reviewed journals) to provide a 
critical assessment of the pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and clinical documentation on the active ingredient.  
During  the  procedure  the  applicant  was  requested  to  reword  the  indication  with  regard  to  the  malignant 
conditions  (“Malignant  tumours  and  haemoblastosis  as  part  of  a  polychemotherapy  regimen  insofar  as  oral 
treatment is indicated”) in order to adapt them to oncology indications only where oral methotrexate regimens 
are currently established. In view of the updated dosing guidelines released by the European Society of Medical 
Oncology considering parenteral methotrexate therapy only without mentioning an oral route for a number of 
cancers (gestational trophoblastic disease, breast cancer, follicular lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, mantle cell 
lymphoma,  multiple  myeloma,  myelodisplastic  syndromes,  osteosarcoma  and  head  and  neck  cancer 
[http://www.esmo.org/Guidelines])  and  considering  that  the  proposed  parenteral  doses  are  usually  much 
higher than those proposed for oral administration, the applicant proposed to delete all oncological indications, 
Assessment report  - Jylamvo 
EMA/78284/2017  
Page 24/33 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
with  the  exception  of  ALL  for  which  a  suitable  oral  dose  has  been  established  for  methotrexate.  This  was 
accepted by the CHMP and adequate dosing recommendations were included into the SmPC. 
Taking  into  account  that  Methotrexate  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  function 
because of the unpredictable pharmacokinetics with a risk for fatal pancytopenia, the applicant updated the 
SmPC with dose adjustment tables to be applied to patients with renal impairment with rheumatic diseases and 
ALL. 
In  the  proposed  SmPC  food  intake  recommendation  was  different  depending  on  dose  with  a  fasting 
recommendation at doses >15 mg and intake independently of food at doses <15 mg. Although the presence of 
a food effect was not assessed by the Applicant with the proposed methotrexate oral solution, significant food 
effect  is  not  expected  with  a  solution  formulation,  since  there  is  no  drug  release  from  the  formulation  as 
methotrexate is completely dissolved at the time of administration. As these dosing recommendations could not 
be supported for the oral solution, the applicant deleted these recommendations from section 4.2 of the SmPC 
with which the CHMP agreed. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Methotrexate  is  an  established  medicinal  product  which  has  been  used  in  humans  for  over  50  years  in  the 
European Union (EU). It is currently authorised for long-term use in children and adults by oral and parenteral 
routes of administration. As demonstration of bioequivalence was not feasible against the reference product due 
to  differences  in  formulation,  two  bioequivalence  studies  were  provided.  Bioequivalence  to  Methotrexate 
“Lederle”  2.5  mg  tablets  provided  the  bridge  to  the  clinical  data  and  product  information  of  the  originator 
including the rheumatologically indications.  
Additionally  and  in  support  of  the  indication  ALL,  the  applicant  demonstrated  bioequivalence  to  Ebetrexat® 
10 mg tablets, an oral formulation of methotrexate which is authorised in oncological indications. The claimed 
oncological indication ALL for Jylamvo was further supported by dosing guidelines released by the European 
Society of Medical Oncology which define a suitable oral dose for methotrexate in the treatment of ALL. 
As dosing guidelines released by the European Society of Medical Oncology only consider oral methotrexate 
therapy for ALL, and no further justification could be provided to maintain the broader oncological indication of 
malignant tumours and haemoblastosis as licenced for Ebetrexat® 10 mg tablets, the company agreed to limit 
the oncology indications to ALL, for which a suitable oral dose has been established for methotrexate.  
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
To support this application, two bioequivalence studies were conducted. One of the studies, Study MTX002, 
compared the proposed oral solution with Methotrexate “Lederle” 2.5 mg tablets, which belongs to the same 
global marketing authorisation as the originator injectable product (Methotrexat “Lederle" 25 mg/ml – 
Stechampulle), in order to allow the bridging to the clinical data and Product Information of the originator. The 
other study, Study MTX001, compared the oral bioavailability of the 2 mg/mL oral solution with the hybrid 
product Ebetrexat® 10 mg tablets providing additional supportive data. 
The test formulation of Jylamvo met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with both 
products. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-72h, and 
Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. 
Assessment report  - Jylamvo 
EMA/78284/2017  
Page 29/33 
  
  
 
 
 
Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
The proposed indications for Jylamvo were identical to those of the reference product Methotrexat “Lederle” 
2.5mg tablets for all rheumatologically and dermatological disorders. The claimed oncological indications were 
in line with Ebetrexat® 10 mg tablets: 
Jylamvo is for use in adults, adolescents and children aged 3 years and over. 
In rheumatological and dermatological diseases 
•  Active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients. 
• 
Polyarthritic forms of severe, active juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) when the response to 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been inadequate. 
•  Severe, treatment-refractory, disabling psoriasis, which does not respond sufficiently to other 
forms of treatment such as phototherapy, PUVA therapy and retinoids, and severe psoriatic 
arthritis in adult patients. 
In malignant tumours and haemoblastosis 
Malignant tumours and haemoblastosis as part of a polychemotherapy regimen insofar as oral treatment is 
indicated. 
Methotrexate is an established drug which has been used in humans for over 50 years in the EU. It is currently 
authorised for long-term use in children and adults by oral and parenteral routes of administration. The 
pharmacology, toxicity, kinetics and clinical adverse effects of methotrexate following oral and systemic 
administration are well known.   
The reference product Methotrexat “Lederle" 25 mg/ml  - Stechampulle is authorised for indications in oncology, 
which is not the case for Methotrexate “Lederle” 2.5 mg tablets to which bioequivalence was demonstrated to 
provide the scientific bridge to the clinical data and product information. Additional data to support the 
indications in oncology was provided by the results of the bioequivalence study to Ebetrexat® 10 mg tablets. 
Furthermore several protocol treatments for cancers use methotrexate as a well-established drug, and in ALL 
methotrexate oral treatment has a well-established role in maintenance.  
However, in view of the updated dosing guidelines released by the European Society of Medical Oncology in 
which only for ALL a suitable oral dose has been established for methotrexate, the oncological indication initially 
claimed was adapted to “Maintenance treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in adults, adolescents 
and children aged 3 years and over.” 
In general, the incidence and severity of acute side effects of methotrexate are related to dose, frequency of 
administration, and the duration of the exposure to significant blood levels of methotrexate to the target organs 
The most common dose-related toxic effects of methotrexate are on the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. 
Bone-marrow depression can occur abruptly, and leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia may all occur. 
Methotrexate is associated with liver damage, both acute (notably after high doses) and, more seriously, chronic 
(generally after long-term use). Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis may develop without obvious signs of 
hepatotoxicity, and have led to eventual death. Other adverse effects include renal failure and tubular necrosis 
after high doses, pulmonary reactions including life-threatening interstitial lung disease, skin reactions 
(sometimes severe), alopecia, and ocular irritation. Neurotoxicity may be seen: leukoencephalopathy, paresis, 
demyelination are associated particularly with intrathecal use and are more likely when cranial irradiation is also 
given. Intrathecal use may also produce arachnoiditis, an acute syndrome of headache, nuchal rigidity, back 
Assessment report  - Jylamvo 
EMA/78284/2017  
Page 30/33 
  
  
 
 
 
 
pain, and fever. Other rarer reactions may include megaloblastic anaemia, osteoporosis, precipitation of 
diabetes, arthralgias, necrosis of soft tissue and bone, and anaphylaxis. Methotrexate may cause defective 
oogenesis and spermatogenesis, and fertility may be impaired (this may be reversible). Like other folate 
inhibitors it is teratogenic, and it has been associated with foetal deaths. Lymphomas (generally reversible on 
withdrawal of treatment) have occasionally been reported with methotrexate therapy, although the association 
has been questioned [Martindale, 2014]. The respective side effect profile is adequately described in the SmPC 
in accordance with the reference product and appropriately managed by the adopted RMP.  
As Jylamvo, in contrast to the reference product, combines oncological and rheumatological indications in an 
oral formulation the wording in section 4.4 of the SmPC was strengthened and a box warning was included to 
warn health care professionals about the risks associated to prescribing or dispensing the correct dose of the 
product according to the corresponding indication and to advise them that Patients with rheumatological or 
dermatological diseases must be informed unequivocally that treatment is to be taken just once a week and not 
daily. 
Further risk minimization measures such as separating the oncological and rheumatologically indications were 
not considered necessary at this time. Together with the adopted educational material to be put in place the risk 
is considered sufficiently managed.   
A positive benefit/risk ratio can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Jylamvo is not similar to Atriance, Xaluprine, Blincyto and Iclusig 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Jylamvo is favourable in the following indications: 
In rheumatological and dermatological diseases 
•  Active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients. 
• 
Polyarthritic forms of active, severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in adolescents and children aged 
3 years and over when the response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been 
inadequate. 
•  Severe, treatment-refractory, disabling psoriasis which does not respond sufficiently to other forms of 
treatment such as phototherapy, psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA) therapy and retinoids, 
and severe psoriatic arthritis in adult patients. 
In oncology

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing polatuzumab vedotin was 
considered justified based on clinical observations supporting improved survival in 
relapsed/refractory patients when the proposed treatment is added on to other existing 
treatments; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to involvement of single or multiple nodal or extra nodal 
sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow and life-threatening with 5-year survival 
rates reported as low as approximately 25% for high risk patients; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4.3 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
in addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European 
Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing polatuzumab vedotin will be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
condition. The sponsor has provided non-clinical and preliminarily clinical observations in 
relapsed/refractory patients supporting add-on effects in terms of clinical response and survival, 
when the product is combined with other existing treatments. The Committee considered that this 
constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common histologic subtype of non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL) accounting for 35% of NHL and 80% of aggressive lymphomas.   
The approved therapeutic indication “Polivy in combination with bendamustine and rituximab is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) who are not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant.” falls within the scope of the 
designated orphan condition “treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP on the 
basis of the submitted evidence including pivotal trial GO29365. Polivy received a conditional 
marketing authorisation. For a full discussion of the results and the justification of the conditional 
marketing authorisation please be referred to the European Public Assessment Report of Polivy.

Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
At the time of initial designation and review at initial marketing authorisation, the COMP agreed that 
the condition was chronically debilitating and life-threatening.  
At the time of this review DLBCL was presented to the COMP to remain chronically debilitating and life-
threatening disease with a median survival of less than one year if left untreated. Approximately 60% 
of patients may be cured with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone 
(R-CHOP), the current standard of care. The clinical course can be debilitating due to constitutional 
symptoms, local symptoms of lymphadenopathy, end-organ damage from disease involvement, and 
bone marrow failure that may lead to infections, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia 
The COMP concluded that the condition remains chronically debilitating and life-threatening with 5-year 
survival rates reported as low as approximately 25% for high risk patients.  
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation, the prevalence (P) was agreed to be approximately 4.3 per 10,000.  
For this review the prevalence was presented to the COMP to remain less than 5 per 10,000 and was 
estimated to be 4.54 per 10,000. This estimate has been derived by using the formula P=I*D 
(incidence * duration). For the calculation, the most recent 2018 incidence figures of NHL have been 
used from the Globocan database. It was assumed that 47.8% of NHL would account for DLBCL. The 
disease duration was estimated to be 5 years. These estimates have been reported by Smith and 
colleagues based on data from the Hematologic Malignancy Research Network (HMRN), which covers a 
limited area in the United Kingdom. The figures and estimates of all EU countries have been presented 
(table 1) with an EU wide prevalence estimate of 4.54 per 10,000. The COMP concluded that the 
currently available epidemiological data sufficiently demonstrate that the prevalence of DLBCL remains 
below the threshold. The COMP will continue to closely monitor the prevalence of DLBCL.

DLBCL = diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; NHL = non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; yr = year 
Note: European male and female population estimates for 2018 were obtained from Eurostat. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There are authorised products in the EU for the treatment of DLBCL: 
•  Rituximab (Mabthera) is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B 
cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy; 
• 
Pixantrone (Pixuvri) is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply 
relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (NHL). Some chemotherapy 
agents are approved nationally in several EU countries under different trade names for the 
treatment of certain cancer types; 
•  Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy; 
• 
Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. 
Several medicinal products are authorised and used for the treatment of Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. 
These include cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, bendamustine, bleomycin, vincristine, vindesine, 
etoposide, iphosphamide, chlorabucil, lomustine, prednisone, and prednisolone, docetaxel, 
mitoxantrone, methotrexate, epirubicin, dexamethasone, cytarabine. 
There is an ESMO treatment guideline on DLBCL (Tillly et al, Ann Oncol (2015) 26 (suppl 5): v116-
v125) outlining the best standard of care of patients affected by the condition. The treatment 
guidelines are not updated to reflect currently authorised treatment options, i.e. CAR-T cell products 
tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
Significant benefit 
EMA protocol assistance on clinical development was requested prior to marketing authorisation, but 
no question with respect to the demonstration of significant benefit for the maintenance of the orphan 
status to be assessed by the COMP had been included by the sponsor. Significant benefit needs to be 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 7/9 
 
 
 
    
 
  
  
  
demonstrated in adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are 
not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant. The current ESMO guideline does not indicate a 
preferred chemotherapy for these patients.  
The results of clinical study GO29365 were submitted to demonstrate significant benefit. The same 
data were assessed by the CHMP for the establishment of benefit risk (please be referred to the 
European Public Assessment Report of Polivy). The pivotal study GO29365 is a Phase Ib/II, 
multicenter, open-label, multi-arm study (only the randomised arms C and D are relevant for this 
application) of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with bendamustine plus rituximab in patients with 
relapsed/refractory DLBCL. The median number of prior therapies of enrolled patients was 2 (range: 1- 
7), with 29% (n = 23) receiving one prior therapy, 25% (n = 20) receiving 2 prior therapies, and 46% 
(n = 37) receiving 3 or more prior therapies. On the basis of this trial, Polivy received conditional 
marketing authorisation in adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) who are not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant. The COMP acknowledged that 
the indication for Polivy includes patients in 2nd line of treatment for which no approved treatment 
exists. 
Furthermore, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC) (Signorovitch et al. 2012) were provided 
to argue improved efficacy over therapeutic regimens Yescarta, Kymriah, and Pixantrone in third and 
late line DLBCL therapy. Moreover, improved safety was claimed highlighting specific adverse events 
that are associated with Yescarta and Kymriah. Finally, major contribution to patient care over 
Yescarta and Kymriah was argued on the basis that Polivy could be readily available without the need 
to wait for patient-specific  manufacturing of the current CAR-T cell therapeutics.  
The COMP noted the arguments on improved efficacy, improved safety and major contribution to 
patient care in third and late line DLBCL therapy. However, the COMP concluded that Polivy is of 
significant benefit because it is the first medicinal product with a specific indication in second line of 
treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This is considered to be a clinically relevant advantage for 
patients affected by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are relapsed/refractory and are not candidates 
for haematopoietic stem cell transplant.

4.  COMP position adopted on 5 December 2019 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be 4.5 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening with 5-year survival rates reported as 
low as approximately 25% for high risk patients. The disease is curable in 60% of the patients;  
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, Polivy is of significant benefit to patients affected by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are 
relapsed/refractory and are not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant. A phase Ib/II, 
multicenter, open-label, randomised study of Polivy in combination with bendamustine and 
rituximab demonstrated a significant increase in responses, supported by an improvement in 
progression free survival, when compared to bendamustine and rituximab therapy in adult patients 
with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Polivy is the first medicinal product with a 
specific indication in second line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The COMP considered that this 
demonstrates a clinically relevant advantage. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Polivy, polatuzumab vedotin, 
EU/3/18/2013 for treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is not removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

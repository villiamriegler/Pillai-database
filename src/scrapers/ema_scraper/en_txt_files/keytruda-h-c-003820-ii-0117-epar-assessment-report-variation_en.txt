2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The scope of this type II variation is to include a new indication for KEYTRUDA in combination with 
chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic 
cervical cancer in adults, based on the results from KEYNOTE-826 study. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The initial claimed indication is “KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy with or without 
bevacizumab, is indicated for the treatment of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer in 
adults”. 
The indication was updated during the procedure to “KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy 
with or without bevacizumab, is indicated for the treatment of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic 
cervical cancer in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1”. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Globally, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with approximately estimated 
600,000 new cases in 2020, representing 6.5% of all female cancers (Sung H, 2021). Approximately 
350,000 deaths from cervical cancer occurred in 2020, 90% of them in low- and middle-income 
Assessment report

countries. Rates in EU and US are much lower, ranking 20th (1%) among all new cancer cases. In 
Europe, incidence (age standardized rate per 100,000) ranges from 7 in Western Europe to 14.5 in 
Eastern Europe (Sung H, 2021), yielding roughly 61,000 new cases in 2018. Mortality (per 100,000) 
ranges from 2.1 (Northern) to 6.6 (Central/Eastern) with nearly 26,000 deaths in 2018 (Ferlay J, 
2018).  
The most significant cause of cervical cancer is persistent papillomavirus infection. HPV is detected in 
99% of cervical tumours, particularly the oncogenic subtypes such as HPV 16 and 18 (ESMO GL Marth 
C, 2017). Immunization against HPV prevents infection with the types of HPV against which the 
vaccine is designed and thus is expected to prevent specific HPV cancer in women (NCCN GL). Cervical 
cancer screening programmes have reduced incidence and death rates. For many years, the 
Papanicolaou (Pap) test has been the standard method for cervical cancer screening. More recently, an 
HPV test has been introduced as a screening tool as HPV DNA is present in almost all cervical cancers 
and it has demonstrated higher sensitivity for high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) 
than that achieved by cytology in several studies (ESMO GL). The WHO recommends the screening of 
the general population of women aged 30 to 49 years using HPV DNA detection as the primary 
screening test at a regular screening interval of every 5 to 10 years. Where HPV DNA testing is not yet 
operational, WHO suggests a regular screening interval of every 3 years when using visual inspection 
with acetic acid or cytology as the primary screening test. Screening should be coupled with timely and 
efficacious treatment of precancerous lesions (WHO, 2021). 
Therefore, primary prevention of cervical cancer is possible via immunisation with HPV vaccines and 
secondary prevention has gained impetus with the advent of sensitive HPV DNA testing to improve 
traditional Pap cytology screening programmes (Marth C, 2017).  
Other important cofactors include smoking, some sexually transmittable infections, a higher number of 
childbirths, early age of onset of coitus, large number of sexual partners, long-term use of oral 
contraceptives, and chronic immunosuppression (NCCN GL; Herrero R, 2018). 
Biologic features 
Squamous cell carcinomas account for 70%–80% of cervical cancers and adenocarcinomas for 20%–
25% (ESMO GL). Patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma undergo the same 
standard treatment, even though these histologic subtypes differ substantially in terms of HPV and 
mutation status (HPV16 for SCC, HPV18 for adenocarcinoma), immune infiltrate, response to therapy, 
and patient outcome. Several retrospective studies showed that patients with adenocarcinoma have a 
higher risk of developing metastases, resulting in a poorer prognosis (Rotman J, 2020). 
Approximately 5–11% of all cervical cancers are reported to be HPV-negative, which can be attributed 
to truly negative and false-negative results. The truly HPV-negative cervical cancers are almost all 
cervical adenocarcinomas with unclear aetiology (Xing B, 2021). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Due to current screening procedures used in Western countries for the early detection of CIN and 
cervical cancer, almost half of the newly diagnosed adult cervical cancer patients have Stage I 
localized cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of over 90%. Five-year survival rates decrease with stage 
at diagnosis, becoming as low as 15-17% for metastatic disease (Lorin, 2015; Munich cancer registry 
2016; SEER Cervical Cancer).  
The median age at the diagnosis of cervical cancer is 50 years (CDC statistics).

Management 
Treatment options for cervical cancer in adults include surgery (conization and hysterectomy), 
radiation, and chemotherapy alone or in combination, depending on the stage of the disease (NCCN). 
Chemotherapy is often recommended for patients with extrapelvic metastases or recurrent disease 
who are not candidates for RT or exenterative surgery. Patients who develop distant metastases, either 
at initial presentation or at relapse, are rarely curable, and systemic treatment is provided for 
palliation, aiming of relieving symptoms and improving quality of life, is indicated if the patient has a 
performance status (PS) <=2 and no formal contraindications (NCCN, ESMO). Cisplatin-based doublets 
with topotecan or paclitaxel have demonstrated superiority to cisplatin monotherapy in terms of 
response rate and PFS, especially in patients previously exposed to CRT where cisplatin was used as 
radiosensitizer (Moore, 2004; Long, 2005). A large randomised phase III trial (GOG-204) comparing 
four different cisplatin-based doublets with paclitaxel, topotecan, gemcitabine or vinorelbine was 
unable to demonstrate the superiority of any regimen. Nevertheless, paclitaxel–cisplatin showed the 
highest response rate (29%), median PFS (5.8 months) and median OS (12.8 months) and was 
considered the preferred regimen based on the balance between efficacy and toxicity profile (ESMO 
GL; Monk BJ, 2009). The GOG-240 study explored the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in a 
randomised phase III trial with a 2x2 factorial design in which OS was the primary endpoint. Patients 
with primary stage IVB or recurrent/persistent, PS 0 or 1 and measurable disease were randomised to 
paclitaxel–cisplatin or paclitaxel–topotecan, both with or without bevacizumab. The median OS was 
significantly prolonged by the addition of bevacizumab (16.8 vs 13.3 months; HR 0.765; 95% CI: 
0.62–0.95; p=0.0068) and non-platinum doublet resulted not superior to cisplatin–paclitaxel, even in 
the population previously treated with cisplatin. Patients treated with bevacizumab had a higher risk of 
grade 2 hypertension (25% vs 1.8%), grade 3 venous thromboembolic events (8.2% vs 1.8%) and 
grade 2 fistula (8.6% vs 1%) (Tewari KS, 2014). A 2017 systemic review and meta-analysis found a 
trend towards improved OS with the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy. Paclitaxel and cisplatin 
combined with bevacizumab is considered the preferred first-line regimen in metastatic or recurrent 
cervical cancer, based on the balance between efficacy and toxicity profile (ESMO, NCCN). Based on 
the results of GOG-240 study, bevacizumab was approved in EU in 2015 with the following indication: 
“Bevacizumab, in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, paclitaxel and topotecan in 
patients who cannot receive platinum therapy, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
persistent, recurrent, or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix (see Section 5.1).” (EPAR Avastin II/72).  
The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin could be considered an alternative for patients that are 
not candidates for cisplatin, especially in patients who have already received cisplatin based on the 
results of a Japanese randomised clinical trial (JCOG0505) (ESMO GL, NCCN, Kitagawa 2015). Based 
on the collective findings of GOG-240 and JCOG0505, the NCCN guidelines added the combination 
carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab as an alternative treatment option. Approximately 59% of patients 
in the US in clinical setting receive a 1L bevacizumab-containing regimen (Kantar Health, cervical 
cancer U.S., 2021). The single-arm CECILIA study evaluated bevacizumab in combination with 
carboplatin–paclitaxel for advanced cervical cancer. The study concluded that bevacizumab can be 
combined with carboplatin–paclitaxel in this population, and the fistula/gastrointestinal perforation 
incidence was in line with GOG-0240; efficacy results were encouraging, within the limits of the single 
arm study (Redondo A, 2020). 
According to ESMO guidelines, in patients progressing following first-line therapy, different cytostatic 
agents, including vinorelbine, topotecan, gemcitabine or nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel have 
been evaluated. However, response rates are low and duration of responses is short. Therefore, no 
recommendation can be given about the most effective second-line treatment (ESMO GL).

KEYTRUDA received FDA accelerated approval for second and later lines of treatment for recurrent or 
metastatic cervical cancer which has progressed on or after chemotherapy in participants who are PD-
L1 positive (CPS ≥1) based on ORR of 14.3% with 91% of responses lasting for at least 6 months 
based on the results of KEYNOTE-158 (Chung HC, 2019).  
To date, a recently completed RCT (EMPOWER-Cervical 1) with another anti-PD1 agent cemiplimab 
(not yet approved in any country) showed significantly improved OS compared with chemotherapy in 
recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer following progression after 1L platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Median OS for cemiplimab was 12.0 months versus 8.5 months for chemotherapy alone (HR 0.69). In 
this study, patients treated with cemiplimab who had positive PD-L1 expression on tumor cells 
benefited the most (median OS, 13.9 months) in comparison with those with negative PD-L1 
expression (7.7 months) and those treated with chemotherapy (0.70 in PD-L1 positive, 0.98 in PD-L1 
negative; PFS HR 0.75 vs 1, and ORR 18.3% vs 11.4% in PD-L1 positive vs negative tumors, 
respectively) (Tewari KS, 2021).  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Pembrolizumab is a highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to human programmed 
cell death 1 (PD-1) and blocks the interaction between the PD-1 pathway receptor and its ligands, 
programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) on antigen presenting tumor cells. 
In the EU, pembrolizumab is currently approved, as monotherapy and in combination with other 
agents, for the treatment of melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, HNSCC, MSI-H or dMMR tumours (CRC, 
endometrial carcinoma, gastric, small intestine, or biliary cancer), urothelial cancer, oesophageal 
cancer, breast cancer, endometrial carcinoma and cHL. This is the first extension of indication 
requested for cervical cancer.

CHMP scientific advice was obtained on the study design of the pivotal study KEYNOTE-826 in EU on 
28-JUN-2018 (EMEA/H/SA/2437/23/2018/II). CHMP concluded that the trial may be acceptable as 
such but would present a difficult case to assess due to the heterogeneity in the study population and 
the potential that efficacy gains may be offset by toxicity. In the proposed setting, the CHMP 
considered OS as the preferred primary endpoint, and commented to be in the position to assess 
mature OS data in order to properly assess the B/R in all subgroups. 
The change of primary endpoint PFS from BICR to investigator assessment was discussed with FDA 
(Meeting type B, 23 Feb 2021, minutes included in the dossier). FDA noted that the proposed change 
is at the Sponsor's discretion and the acceptability of the approach will be a review issue. 
Additionally, a pre-submission meeting was held with the EU Rapporteurs and EMA on 26-JUL-2021, 
where results from the KEYNOTE-826 study were presented and discussed in view of the planned Type 
II variation application. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH claimed that KEYNOTE-826 study was conducted in conformance with applicable country or 
local requirements regarding ethical committee review, informed consent, and other statutes or 
regulations regarding the protection of the rights and welfare of human participants in biomedical 
research.  
The assessment of KEYNOTE-826 data did not raise concern over GCP compliance leading to request 
for GCP inspection.   
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/224169/2022

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) proteins are exempted from the submission of ERA studies because they 
are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Pembrolizumab is a protein, therefore an 
ERA has not been submitted by the MAH. This is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Table 2. Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pembrolizumab PK disposition has been characterized via pooled population PK analyses using serum 
concentration-time data contributed from subjects across various clinical studies using a time-dependent 
PK (TDPK) model. The PK reference dataset for monotherapy includes all available PK data from subjects 
enrolled  on  KEYNOTE-001,  KEYNOTE-002,  KEYNOTE-006,  KEYNOTE-010,  and  KEYNOTE-024,  with  an 
overall  sample  size  of  2993.  This  serves  as  the  PK  reference  analysis  to  support  descriptions  of 
pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in the USPI and EU SmPC. 
Absorption 
Pembrolizumab  is  dosed  via  the  intravenous  route  and  therefore  is  immediately  and  completely 
bioavailable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/224169/2022

Distribution 
Consistent  with  a  limited  extravascular  distribution,  the  volume  of  distribution  of  pembrolizumab  at 
steady  state  is  small  (6.0  L;  coefficient  of  variation  [CV]:  20%).  As  expected  for  an  antibody, 
pembrolizumab does not bind to plasma proteins in a specific manner. 
Elimination 
Pembrolizumab  CL  is  approximately  23%  lower  (geometric  mean,  195  mL/day  [CV%:  40%])  after 
achieving maximal change at steady state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]); this 
decrease in CL with time is not considered clinically meaningful. The geometric mean value (CV%) for 
the terminal half-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state. 
Pharmacokinetic in subjects with cervical cancer 
Efficacy and safety data in support of the current submission were obtained from study KEYNOTE-826 
where patients were treated with the combination of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy with or without 
bevacizumab. 
As  part  of  the  agreement  established  in  2017  with  the  EMA  to  streamline  the  clinical  pharmacology 
content in the clinical development program of KEYTRUDA, pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity data 
were not collected in KEYNOTE-826. 
The focus of the clinical pharmacology report is on the clinical PK data from participants with cervical 
cancer  in  Group  E  of  study  KEYNOTE-158  (a  Phase  2,  multicohort,  open-label,  nonrandomized  study 
designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  participants  with 
unresectable or metastatic solid tumors). 
Data from KEYNOTE-158, Group E are supportive of the proposed pembrolizumab dose of 200 mg Q3W 
for adults with cervical cancer. 
Moreover,  the  MAH  is  also  applying  for  the  400  mg  Q6W  dosing  regimen.  This  dosing  regimen  was 
approved in the EU for all adult monotherapy indications (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0062 [March 2019]) and 
for all adult indications in combination with other anticancer agents (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0102 [May 
2021]). The dosing regimen of 400 mg Q6W is then applicable across all adult indications, including this 
proposed indication for cervical cancer, regardless of the combination treatment type. 
PK Data Keynote-158 
KEYNOTE-158  is  an  ongoing,  non-randomized,  single  arm,  multi-site,  open-label  study  of 
pembrolizumab in previously treated participants who have locally advanced unresectable or metastatic 
rare  cancers  for  whom  prior  standard  first-line  treatment  had  failed.  Eligible  participants  received 
pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
KEYTRUDA  is  an  antibody  that  binds  to  the  programmed  cell  death-1  (PD-1)  receptor  and  blocks  its 
interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that 
has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell 
responses,  including  anti-tumour  responses,  through  blockade  of  PD-1  binding  to  PD-L1  and  PD-L2, 
which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the 
tumour microenvironment.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No new information regarding PK/PD modelling for pembrolizumab is available within this extension of 
indication. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
While the efficacy and safety data of the current submission are based on the combination of 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab from KEYNOTE-826, the focus on the 
clinical Pharmacology is on data from participants with cervical cancer in Group E of KEYNOTE-158 a 
Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab monotherapy in participants with unresectable or metastatic solid 
tumours, including cervical carcinoma. 
The observed serum concentration values in subjects with cervical cancer from KEYNOTE-158 study 
are contained within the 90% CI of the reference PK model, which indicate that pembrolizumab data 
from KEYNOTE-158 group E is consistent with the historical data in both cycle 1 postdose and cycle 4 
predose. PK concentrations reached ~ 88% of the steady-state concentrations at the end of cycle 3 
(timepoint for cycle 4 pre-dose). 
Observed pembrolizumab concentration data in KEYNOTE-158 group E for subjects with cervical 
carcinoma were compared with simulated profiles for female subjects only using the reference PK 
model and resulted to fall within predicted concentrations. 
Tabular summaries of descriptive statistics and boxplots comparing observed pembrolizumab 
concentrations of 200 mg Q3W from participants with cervical carcinoma in KEYNOTE-158 group E and 
female subjects in other monotherapy trials, showed consistent concentration values between female 
subjects with cervical cancer and other approved monotherapy trials in NSCLC, UC, HNSCC, HL and 
MSI-H. 
Although a substantial characterization of the clinical pharmacology and immunogenicity profile of 
pembrolizumab has been provided in previous applications as monotherapy and in combination with 
small molecules or chemotherapy, the immunogenicity profile when another biologic drug is 
administered in combination with pembrolizumab is unknown.  
No new ADA data are provided in this submission based on the following consideration argued by the 
MAH: 
• 
• 
• 
the  existing  immunogenicity  assessment  for  pembrolizumab  for  the  monotherapy  setting  is 
based  on  a  sufficiently  large  dataset  of  patients  across  several  indications,  with  very  low 
observed rates of total treatment ADA across different pembrolizumab regimens (1.4 – 3.8%) 
as well as of neutralizing antibodies (0.4 – 1.6%). This analysis has not demonstrated impact on 
efficacy or safety, as currently summarized in the EU SmPC and USPI.  
the  low  rate  of  immunogenicity  has  been  shown  to  be  consistent  across  tumor  type  and  no 
clinically  meaningful  consequences  have  been  observed  in  the  subjects  with  a  positive 
immunogenicity reading.  
the  incidence  of  ADA  has  not  been  impacted  by  the  presence  of  another  small  molecule  or 
chemotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab. 
In 2017, the MAH was recommended “to assess immunogenicity for co-administered biologics and also 
to collect ADA samples for pembrolizumab at least until results form a sufficient number of cases will 
provide characterization of the pembrolizumab immunogenicity profile in such combinations, making 
unnecessary further analysis”.

During this procedure, the Applicant provided data from study KEYNOTE-021 cohort B where 24 
patients were treated with pembrolizumab in combination with paclitaxel, carboplatin and 
bevacizumab.  
Among these patients, only 16 subjects were evaluable for immunogenicity and although data showed 
that only 1 subject/16 was found to be treatment-emergent positive and had no antibodies with 
neutralizing capacity, the number of analysed subjects is very low and the Applicant is encouraged to 
further collect PK and ADA samples in study MK-3475-B96/KEYNOTE-B96/ENGOT-ov65 that is still 
recruiting and to provide data in the context of future procedure. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of pembrolizumab when used in combination with chemotherapy has been extensively evaluated 
in a number of cancer indications and demonstrates that the PK of pembrolizumab is consistent across 
tumour  types  and  it  is  not  impacted  by  concomitant  chemotherapy.  However,  a  comprehensive 
characterization of the immunogenicity profile of pembrolizumab in combination with other biologic drugs 
and in particular with bevacizumab is lacking and should be better defined in future procedures.

Sample size 
The study was planned to randomize approximately 600 participants (all-comers) in a 1:1 ratio between 
the two arms, over a period of 16 months. Approximately 510 participants were expected to be CPS≥1 
Assessment report  
EMA/224169/2022  
Page 23/148 
 
 
 
 
and  300  participants  were  expected  to  be  CPS≥10.  The  study  is  event-driven  and  completes  after 
accumulation of sufficient events to determine efficacy for PFS and for OS. 
Sample Size and Power Calculations for PFS and OS 
The study includes dual-primary efficacy endpoints: 1) PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator 
and 2) OS. The study includes multiple hypotheses testing the superiority of pembrolizumab compared 
to placebo, and it was to be considered positive if it is positive for either the PFS or OS hypothesis test 
for any of the 3 groups: CPS≥1 group, all-comers, and CPS≥10 group. 
PFS 
The duration of PFS in the control arm is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with a median 
of 7.1 months based on historical data. The PFS hypothesis testing was designed as follows: 
H1: CPS≥1 group (expected N=510): It was expected that with approximately 370 and 435 PFS events 
at the planned IA1 and IA2 (final analysis for PFS), the trial has a power of 91% to detect a hazard ratio 
of 0.68 at one-sided α = 0.004.  
H2: All-comers (N=600): It was expected that with approximately 432 and 508 events at the planned 
IA1 and IA2 (final analysis for PFS), the trial has a power of 91% to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 at 
one-sided α = 0.004 (when H1 is rejected). 
H3: CPS ≥ 10 group (N=300): It was expected that with approximately 210 and 247 PFS events at the 
planned IA1 and IA2 (final analysis for PFS), the trial has a power of 92% to detect a hazard ratio of 
0.60 at one-sided α = 0.005 (when H1 and H2 are rejected). 
OS 
The duration of OS in the control arm is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with a median of 
15.1 months based on historical data. The OS hypothesis testing was designed as follows: 
H4: CPS ≥1 group (N=510): It was expected that with approximately 246, 321, and 378 events at the 
planned IA1, IA2 and final OS analyses, the trial has a power of 90% to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 
at one-sided α = 0.016. 
H5: All-comers (N=600): It was expected that with approximately 289, 378, and 445 events at the 
planned IA1, IA2 and final OS analyses, the trial has a and power of 90% to detect a hazard ratio of 
0.72 at one-sided α = 0.016 (when H4 is rejected). 
H6: CPS ≥10 group (N=300): It was expected that with approximately 127, 167, and 196 events at the 
planned IA1, IA2 and final OS analyses, the trial has a power of 93% to detect a hazard ratio of 0.60 
at one-sided α = 0.020 (when H4 and H5 are rejected). 
Software used for sample size calculation 
The sample size and power calculations were performed using EAST 6.4 software. 
Randomisation 
Randomization occurred centrally using an interactive voice response system / integrated web response 
system (IVRS/IWRS). There were 2 treatment arms. Participants were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio 
to  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  or  placebo  plus  chemotherapy,  respectively.  The  choice  of 
chemotherapy  (cisplatin  or  carboplatin)  and  +/-  bevacizumab  was  determined  prior  to  randomization 
and documented in the IVRS/IWRS. 
Treatment randomization was stratified based on the following criteria: 
Assessment report  
EMA/224169/2022  
Page 24/148 
 
 
 
1) Metastatic (FIGO [2009] Stage IVB) at initial diagnosis (yes vs. no) 
2) Investigator decision to use bevacizumab (yes vs. no), and 
3) PD-L1 status (CPS <1, CPS 1 to <10, CPS ≥10). 
A total of 12 strata have been utilized in this study. 
Blinding (masking) 
A double-blinding technique with in-house blinding has been used. The participant, the investigator, and 
Sponsor  personnel  or  delegates  who  were  involved  in  the  study  were  unaware  of  treatment  group 
assignments.  Therefore,  pembrolizumab  and  placebo  were  prepared  and/or  dispensed  in  a  blinded 
fashion by an unblinded pharmacist or other qualified site personnel, who provided the investigative staff 
with ready-to-use blinded pembrolizumab or saline infusion solutions, packaged identically to maintain 
the blinding, for administration at scheduled infusion visits. 
Results of the interim analyses were reviewed by an external DMC, which made recommendations for 
discontinuation of the study or protocol modification to an EOC of the Sponsor, who might have been 
unblinded to study results at the treatment level together with limited additional Sponsor personnel in 
order to act on these recommendations or facilitate regulatory filing.  
A total of 84 participants discontinued treatment before the IVRS unblinding and the main reason for the 
unblinding was the progression of the disease.  
Statistical methods 
Protocol Amendments involving statistical methods 
In global amendment 03 (31-JAN-2020) and global amendment 04 (02-APR-2020) the objectives and 
hypotheses  were  modified  with  an  updated  multiplicity  strategy  based  on  updated  results  from  the 
KEYTRUDA  program.  Statistical  analysis  (timing  and  required  events,  alpha  passing  strategy,  efficacy 
boundaries) approach was modified to address changes in primary objectives and hypotheses. Finally, 
in  global  amendment  05  (30-OCT-2020),  the  objectives  including  primary  efficacy  endpoints  were 
modified. The primary PFS endpoint per RECIST 1.1 has been assessed by the investigator instead of by 
BICR (blinded independent central review), the purpose of this amendment was to address discordance 
between  BICR-confirmed progressive  disease  (PD)  and  investigator  assessed  PD  that  could  affect  the 
power of the trial. The table below shows the history of changes.

EMA/224169/2022

Table 7. Summary of Key Revisions to the Protocol Amendments 
Amendments 3 and 4 were mainly driven by the new external data from other studies, such as KEYNOTE-
158 and by additional changes in study procedures, respectively. In Amendment 5, the modification of 
the primary endpoint to PFS by investigator was intended to protect the study from a loss of power, the 
BICR assessment was retained as a secondary endpoint. 
Interim Analyses 
There  are  two  planned  interim  analyses  (IA)  in  addition  to  the  final  analysis  (FA)  for  this  study.  The 
efficacy analyses in this submission are based on IA1. The analyses planned, endpoints evaluated, and

IA1 was performed after approximately 355 PFS events had been observed among participants with CPS
≥1, of which 157 occurred in pembrolizumab arm and 198 in the placebo arm.  
PFS  events  had  been  accruing  significantly  slower  than  expected  at  the  time  the  analysis  plan  was 
constructed,  but  the  number  of  355  at  IA1  was  considered  sufficiently  close  to  the  target  number 
(n=370). 
Error probabilities, adjustment for multiplicity 
Based on emerging data external to this study, the multiplicity strategy including the testing order among 
the 6 primary hypotheses was revised in Protocol Amendments 03 and 04. The update of the multiplicity 
strategy occurred prior to the conduct of efficacy IA1. The overall Type-I error rate among the multiple 
hypotheses was strongly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided). The study used the graphical method of Maurer 
and Bretz to provide strong multiplicity control among the hypotheses of PFS and OS for CPS ≥1 group, 
all-comers, and CPS ≥10 group. Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming group sequential methods has been used 
to allocate alpha among the interim and final analyses for the PFS and OS endpoints. The Figures below 
display the revised multiplicity strategy diagram of the study according to Protocol Amendment 05 on 
the right side and the former multiplicity strategy diagram of the study according to amendment 02 on 
the left side.

Hypotheses  
The  initial  one-sided  alpha  allocation  for  each  hypothesis  is  shown  in  the  ellipse  representing  the 
hypothesis.  The  weights  for  re-allocation  from  each  hypothesis to  the  others  are  in  the  boxes  on the 
lines connecting hypotheses. According to this approach, study hypotheses may be tested more than 
once, and when a particular null hypothesis is rejected, the alpha allocated to that hypothesis can be 
reallocated to other hypothesis tests.  
PFS 
The study initially allocates one-sided α=0.005 to test PFS between two treatment groups for CPS ≥1 
group, all-comers, and CPS ≥10 group. If the null hypothesis of PFS for CPS ≥1 group was rejected, its 
α=0.004  was  reallocated  to  the  PFS  analysis  for  all-comers,  and  if  the  null  hypothesis  of  PFS  for  all-
comers was rejected, its α=0.004 was reallocated to the PFS analysis for CPS ≥10 group. The boundary 
properties  for  each  of  these  alpha-levels  for  the  interim  analyses  were  derived  using  a  Lan-DeMets 
O'Brien-Fleming spending function. The bounds and boundary properties for PFS testing are shown in 
the table below.

OS 
The  study  initially  allocates  one-sided  α=0.020  to  test  OS  between  two  treatment  groups  for  CPS  ≥1 
group, all-comers, and CPS ≥10 group. The OS hypothesis for CPS ≥1 group may be tested at one-sided 
α=0.016 (initially allocated) or higher if one or more null hypotheses for PFS test are rejected. If the null 
hypothesis of OS for CPS ≥1 group was rejected, its α was allocated to the OS analysis for all-comers, 
and if the null hypothesis of OS for all-comers was rejected, its α was reallocated to the OS analysis for 
CPS ≥10 group. The table below shows the bounds and boundary properties for OS testing which were 
derived using a Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming α-spending function. Further details of statistical analyses 
were described in the SAP.

Efficacy analyses 
The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population served as the population for the primary efficacy analyses. All 
randomized participants were included in this population. Participants were analysed in the treatment 
arm to which they are randomized, regardless of whether they received study treatment. A summary of 
the analysis strategy for key efficacy endpoints is presented in the following table:

Table 10. Censoring Rules for DOR 
The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the PFS and OS curve in each treatment 
group. The treatment difference in PFS and OS was assessed by the stratified log-rank test. For PFS and 
OS a stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling was used to assess 
the magnitude of the treatment difference between the treatment arms. The hazard ratio and its 95% 
confidence interval from the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single 
treatment covariate was reported. The same stratification factors used for randomization were applied 
to  both  the  stratified  log-rank  test  and  the  stratified  Cox  model.  Death  is  always  considered  as  a 
confirmed PD event. Participants who do not experience PFS event were censored at the last disease 
assessment, while participants without documented death at the time of analysis were censored at the 
date of last known contact. Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) method may be conducted for OS to 
account for the possible non-proportional hazards effect. 
In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint, one primary and two sensitivity analyses with 
a  different  set  of  censoring  rules  were  performed.  The  censoring  rules  for  primary  and  sensitivity 
analyses are summarized in Table 9. 
The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method was used for the comparison of the ORR between the two 
treatment groups. The difference in ORR and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Miettinen 
and Nurminen method with strata weighting by sample size was reported. The stratification factors used 
for randomization were applied to the analysis.  
DOR was summarised descriptively using Kaplan-Meier medians and quartiles and was assessed using 
RECIST 1.1 by investigator and BICR, respectively. Only the subset of patients who show a complete 
response  or  partial  response  were  included  in  this  analysis.  For  each  DOR  analysis,  a  corresponding 
summary  of  the  censoring  reasons  for  responding participant  were  also provided.  Censoring  rules  for 
DOR are summarized in Table 10.  
Sensitivity analyses are adequate. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup  Analyses  and  Effect  of  Baseline  Factors  are  planned.  To  determine  whether  the  treatment 
effect is consistent across various subgroups, the between-group treatment effect for PFS and OS (with 
a nominal 95% CI) was estimated and plotted by treatment group within each category of the following 
classification variables: Stratification factors, Metastatic at diagnosis (Yes vs. No), Bevacizumab use (Yes 
vs. No), PD-L1 status (CPS<1 vs. CPS 1 to < 10 vs. CPS ≥ 10), Age group (<65 years vs. ≥65 years),

Race (white, non-white), ECOG performance status (0, 1). A Forest plot was produced, which provides 
the estimated point estimates and confidence intervals for the treatment effect across the categories of 
subgroups listed above. The consistency of the treatment effect was assessed descriptively via summary 
statistics by category for the classification variables listed above. 
Safety analyses 
The  safety  analyses  were  based  on  the  APaT  populations,  which  included  all  randomized  participants 
who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. The analysis of safety results followed a tiered approach. 
There were no Tier 1 endpoints in this study, and Tier 2 parameters were assessed via point estimates 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) provided for differences in the proportion of participants with events; 
only point estimates by intervention arm were provided for Tier 3 safety parameters. The 95% CIs for 
the  between-treatment  differences  in  percentages  were  provided  using  the  Miettinen  and  Nurminen 
method. 
PRO analyses 
PRO  analyses  were  based  on  the  PRO  FAS  population,  defined  as  all  randomized  participants  who 
received at least 1 dose of study intervention and had completed at least 1 PRO assessment. Participants 
were included in the treatment arm to which they were randomly assigned in the PRO analyses.

A total of 266 patients screened were not randomized due to screen failure. The main reason for 
screen failure were inadequate organ functions per laboratory value (18.9%), lack of measurable 
disease per RECIST 1.1 (16.6%), not providing informed consent (12.5%), ECOG not 0 or 1 (8.3%), 
other condition that may confound result or interfere with participation (7.9%).

subgroup (35 in pembrolizumab + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab group and 34 in placebo + 
chemotherapy ± bevacizumab group). Efficacy in this group was explored via post hoc efficacy 
analyses at the Agency’s request. KEYNOTE-826 was not designed or powered to make the comparison 
of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab versus placebo + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab in 
participants whose tumors express CPS <1.

Patient-reported Outcomes 
More participants treated with pembrolizumab + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab had improved or stable 
health status/QoL using the EQ-5D-5L compared with participants receiving placebo + chemotherapy ± 
bevacizumab (78.3% vs 71.7%, nominal p=0.033, not adjusted for multiplicity). A prolonged time to 
deterioration in EQ-5D-5L was observed for patients treated with pembrolizumab + chemotherapy ± 
bevacizumab compared to those treated with placebo + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab (HR 0.75; 95% 
CI: 0.58, 0.97; nominal p=0.027, not adjusted for multiplicity). Differences in the EORTC QLQ-C30 
global health status score were not statistically different between the 2 groups.

Subsequent systemic anticancer treatment 
After discontinuation of study treatment, a similar proportion of all-comer participants in the 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab and the placebo + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab 
groups received subsequent systemic anti-cancer treatment.

Supportive study(ies) 
A brief summary of efficacy data, based on clinical study reports for KEYNOTE-028 and KEYNOTE-158 
which have been included in the dossier by the MAH to support safety assessment, is presented below.  
KEYNOTE-028 is an ongoing, Phase 1b, multicenter, nonrandomized, multicohort study of 
pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) in participants with PD-L1 positive metastatic/refractory 
solid tumours. Cohort B4 enrolled participants with cervical squamous cell cancer (N=24). Efficacy data 
are related only to PD-L1 positive population. ORR by investigator assessment of all subjects in Cohort 
B4 (n=24) was 16.7% (95% CI: 4.7, 37.4) and included 4 subjects with a confirmed PR. ORR by 
central radiology assessment (n=20) was 10.0% (95% CI: 1.2, 31.7), with 2 subjects with confirmed 
PR.   
KEYNOTE-158 is an ongoing, Phase 2, multicenter, nonrandomized, multicohort study of 
pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) as monotherapy in previously treated participants with 
advanced solid tumours, independent of PD-L1 status. The study included 13 cohorts in various 
advanced solid tumour indications; Cohort E enrolled participants with cervical cancer (N=98). Of the 
98 participants in the ASaT population, PD-L1 IHC test results were available for 97 participants. 
Cervical carcinoma specimens from 82 (84.5%) participants expressed PD-L1 at a CPS ≥1, while 
specimens from 15 (15.5%) participants were negative for PD-L1 expression. All participants with 
confirmed response (CR or PR) had tumours that were positive for PD-L1 expression (ORR 17.1%, 
14/82).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-826 is a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin plus paclitaxel) with or without bevacizumab vs placebo plus 
chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for the 1L treatment of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic 
cervical cancer.  
In study KEYNOTE-826, patients not amenable to radical treatment and who have not received prior 
systemic chemotherapy (with the exception of radiosensitizing cisplatin) were allowed. All histologies 
were included and disease should be measurable. Patients were fit (ECOG 0-1) and have the usual 
exclusion criteria for immunotherapy. Overall, the enrolment criteria were acceptable. Stratification 
was made according to stage at initial diagnosis, use of bevacizumab and PD-L1 status, which is 
acceptable.  
Maximum 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy were allowed. Participants with on-going clinical 
benefit and who were tolerating combination chemotherapy were allowed to continue chemotherapy 
beyond 6 cycles after Sponsor consultation. Bevacizumab and pembrolizumab/placebo (max 2 years) 
were to be continued until disease progression. Bevacizumab demonstrated overall survival advantage 
when added to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in GOG-240 study, so it is considered 
the preferred first line regimen by international guidelines (ESMO, NCCN). It is however acknowledged 
that its use might not always be feasible related to the safety profile of this drug. In this study, 
approximately 63% of patients received bevacizumab. Baseline characteristics by bevacizumab use 
showed less older patients (over 75) treated with bevacizumab, as well as more patients with ECOG 0. 
This is comprehensible. It is noted that bevacizumab was less used in EU, as compared to North 
America and Asia.  
In the EU, bevacizumab is approved for 1L cervical cancer with cisplatin plus paclitaxel, and not with 
carboplatin; it is acknowledged though that carboplatin is considered an alternative to cisplatin in 
subjects who are not candidate to cisplatin by ESMO guidelines, and the triplet combination with 
Assessment report  
EMA/224169/2022  
Page 77/148 
 
 
 
 
 
carboplatin is included as an alternative in the NCCN guidelines. As discussed in the Scientific Advice, 
population in KEYNOTE-826 was randomised to receive a number of treatment options that are 
expected to impact differently in terms of efficacy/safety.  
Dual primary endpoints were PFS and OS, and the study was considered positive if it was positive for 
either the PFS or OS hypothesis test for any of the 3 groups: CPS≥1, all-comers, and CPS≥10. 
Regarding PFS, the primary endpoint was modified from assessment by independent review (BICR) to 
by investigator (inv) with Amendment 5, released after enrolment was completed but before any 
formal study analysis. The rate of discordance was 21.4% when investigator assessed PD was not 
confirmed by independent assessment based on IA1, which was attributed by the MAH to the 
investigators’ ability to determine radiographic progression with greater sensitivity than assessment by 
BICR. Since PD event determination in metastatic cervical cancer takes into consideration symptoms 
and other clinical findings in addition to imaging, investigators with all evidence at their disposal, are 
anticipated to corroborate radiographic changes as progressive disease. Additional clinical input beyond 
imaging is used to assess progression, suggesting that BICR-determined PFS alone may not have 
adequate sensitivity to identify PD (disease progression) events. Clinical progression without 
radiographic evidence did not have any significant impact on the discordance. Overall, this explanation 
can be followed. The MAH declared that the modification of the primary endpoint to PFS by investigator 
was intended to protect the study from a loss of power while the important and objective assessment 
by BICR was retained as a secondary endpoint. Considering the consistent PFS benefit between the 
assessments by investigators and BICR, this issue can be considered solved. The MAH clarified that 
external pembrolizumab data from KEYNOTE-158 in 2L cervical cancer and from KEYNOTE-048 in 1L 
head and neck cancer motivated the change of hierarchical testing order. Overall, the MAH got greater 
confidence that the PD-L1 positive patient population as defined by the CPS ≥1 cutoff would derive 
sufficient benefit. By that, the hypothesis testing in this population was prioritized above the testing in 
the CPS ≥10 population. This can be followed. 
The used methods for the statistical analysis were appropriate and the type one-error was overall 
controlled at the one-sided 0.025 level. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results have been provided for the interim analysis 1 (data cut-off date 3 May 2021), after a median 
follow up of approximately 17 months (last patient randomized was observed for 15 months at least). 
Although an interim analysis, the overall number of PFS and OS events were about 65% and 50%, 
respectively. Data are considered of sufficient maturity for B/R assessment.  
A total of 617 patients were enrolled (308 in the pembro combo and 309 in the control arm). At the 
data cut-off date, 63.8% and 82.5% in the experimental and control arm have discontinued treatment, 
with higher rate of progression in the control arm, while discontinuation due to adverse events were 
more frequent in the pembro combo arm (12.4% vs 7.8%). Important protocol deviations occurred at 
a limited and similar rate in both arms and are not considered impacting relevantly on study results.  
The majority of women were white with a median age of 51 years (16% were over 65). About 80% 
had distant metastases; of those, 31% had primary metastatic disease. Most patients (~70%) had 
squamous cell carcinoma and 20% adenocarcinoma, consistent with epidemiology of this cancer. Prior 
chemoradiation was received by more than half of the patient. Baseline characteristics were similar in 
both treatment arms, although adenocarcinomas were slightly less represented in the pembrolizumab 
arm (18.2% vs 27.2%).  
At the interim analysis 1, PFS by investigator and OS results were statistically significant in all the 3 
populations analysed (CPS≥1, all comers, CPS≥10).   
Assessment report  
EMA/224169/2022  
Page 78/148 
 
 
 
The results in the all-comers showed statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in OS 
with the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab, with HR of 0.67 (95%CI 0.54, 
0.84) and a gain in median OS was approximately 8 months (from 16.5 to 24.4 months); 12 months 
OS rate increased of 10% (from 64 to 75%). The OS KM curves separated at 4.5 months and remained 
separated throughout the evaluation period in favour of pembrolizumab combination. PFS by 
investigator was also improved in the pembro combo arm (HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.53, 0.79), with median 
PFS 10.4 vs 8.2 months. Improvement was also observed in ORR [65.9% (95%CI 60.3, 71.2) vs 
50.8% (95%CI 45.1, 56.5)] and median DOR (18 vs 10.4 months). 
Overall 89% of all comers expressed PD-L1 as CPS≥1 (273 and 275 patients in pembro and control 
arm), and 51.4% of the population has high PD-L1 expression, defined as CPS≥10 (158 and 159 
patients). Baseline characteristics of these two subpopulations were overall consistent with all comers.  
In the CPS≥1 population, results were consistent with the overall population, showing statistically 
significant and clinically relevant benefit for the pembrolizumab combination arm vs placebo 
combination arm. OS HR was 0.64 (0.5, 0.81), with median OS NR in the experimental arm (19.8, NR) 
vs 16.3 months (14.5, 19.4) in the control arm. The OS KM curves separated in favour of the pembro 
combo arm at month 3. HR for PFS by inv was 0.62 (95%CI 0.50, 0.77), median PFS was 10.4 vs 8.2 
months. Higher ORR by inv was shown in the pembro combo arm (68.1% vs 50.2%) as well as longer 
median DOR (18 vs 10.4 months).   
The advantage for pembrolizumab + standard treatment over standard treatment was more 
pronounced in the CPS≥10 population with respect to all-comers: OS HR 0.61, PFS by inv HR 0.58, 
ORR by inv 69.6% vs 49.1% (95%CI 41.1, 57.1), median DOR 21.1 vs 9.4. 
A post hoc efficacy analysis in the PD-L1 negative population (CPS<1 subgroup) was also performed, 
which included approximately 11% of all comers (35 in the pembrolizumab arm and 34 in the placebo 
arm). The results in this subgroup showed hazard ratio for PFS by investigator of 0.94 (95%CI 0.52, 
1.70), with KM curves roughly superimposed; number of PFS events were more in the control arm 
though (65.7% vs 82.4%). OS HR was 1.00 (95%CI 0.53, 1.89), with almost same event rate in both 
treatment arms (57.1% vs 58.8%). OS KM curves initially are in favour of the control arm, then 
overlap. ORR difference was slightly in favour of the control arm (ORR 48.6% vs 55.9%). Slight 
advantage in median DOR is instead seen in the pembrolizumab arm (10.7 vs 8.5 months).  
It is acknowledged that the study was not designed or powered to make comparison in the CPS<1 
population, which has not been prespecified in the hierarchical testing, and results in this small 
subgroup should be interpreted with caution. This cannot however be raised as a sufficient argument 
against the validity of the results considering that the complementary population of CPS>1 has been 
pre-specified. The available data did not suggest a benefit in this subgroup of patients (and detriment 
cannot be excluded). This is further supported by the apparent lack of activity of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in CPS<1 patients in KEYNOTE-158 in cervical cancer: no objective responses among the 
15 PD-L1 negative patients were seen, as compared to ORR 17.1% (14/82) in PD-L1 positive tumours. 
Another recent RCT in more advanced cervical cancer with an anti PD1 inhibitor showed differential 
benefit based on PD-L1 expression (Tewari KS, 2021). The low prevalence of PD-L1 negative patient 
population is acknowledged in this indication; however, the biological rationale of PD-L1 expression 
status and the lack of benefit for the PD-L1 negative subgroup are supported by the external data in 2L 
cervical cancer above. PD-L1 expression was determined centrally (Neogenomics Laboratories) using a 
validated assay (the investigational PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit). There were no missing data. PD-L1 
expression status was a stratification factor resulting in a balanced distribution of PD-L1 expression 
status between treatment arms. In conclusion, the CHMP considers the evidence of the subgroup 
results sufficiently reliable to draw conclusions.

EMA/224169/2022  
Page 79/148 
 
 
 
In addition, as this is an add-on treatment, patients would be inevitably exposed to supplementary 
pembrolizumab toxicity.  
Taking everything into account, the use of pembrolizumab in combination of chemotherapy+/-
bevacizumab does not appear justified in the CPS<1 population, in whom the B/R is not considered 
favourable. Following CHMP request, the MAH restricted the indication to the PD-L1 CPS≥1 population.  
With regard to subgroup analyses, the treatment benefit observed in the primary analysis populations 
was generally consistent across all subgroups analysed, with the exception of CPS<1 as discussed 
above, and patients who have metastatic disease at study entry, showing lower efficacy in primary 
metastatic disease (PFS HR 0.92, OS HR 0.84). The MAH noted that Stage IVB newly diagnosed is an 
independent poor prognostic factor. Based on additional analyses provided, it does not appear justified 
to exclude difficult to treat patients with newly diagnosed metastatic disease from the proposed 
indication.  
With regard to subgroup according to bevacizumab use (received by 63% of patients), as already 
discussed during the EMA SA, it is considered unfortunate that the study design does not allow to fully 
evaluate the benefit/risk of the additional and rather toxic treatment compound bevacizumab. It is 
observed that in the control arm the outcome of patients not using bevacizumab is inferior in all 
endpoints (OS, PFS, ORR, DOR) as compared to subjects treated with bevacizumab. This is consistent 
with the survival advantage showed with the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in GOG-240 
study, supporting the approval of bevacizumab in 1L cervical cancer. Patients receiving bevacizumab 
with chemotherapy in the control arm appear to have even better outcome than patients receiving 
pembrolizumab with chemotherapy. However, there is a subset of patients who do not receive 
bevacizumab due to risk posed by side effect of bevacizumab. The benefit of adding pembrolizumab to 
backbone chemotherapy is consistent in subgroups with and without bevacizumab.   
The MAH provided subgroup analysis by platinum compound (about 20% of patients received 
cisplatin). Considering that the investigator’s choice of carboplatin vs cisplatin might possibly select a 
heterogeneous patient population regarding prognostic patient and disease characteristics, it is 
reassuring that results by platinum agent are consistent. These data would be also considered relevant 
to support the general indication “in combination with chemotherapy”.  
Approximately 70% of patients had squamous cell carcinoma, and about 25% were adenocarcinoma, 
which reflects the real distribution of histology. Histology was not used as stratification factor. In 
baseline characteristics there was indeed no complete balance among treatment arms by histology in 
the all comers and in the CPS>=1 population. PD-L1 expression by histology data showed lower PD-L1 
positivity in adenocarcinoma. In the updated sought indication in CPS>=1 population, benefit of 
pembrolizumab addition was consistent in both histologies, which is reassuring.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
KEYNOTE-826 study showed statistically significant improvement in PFS at the interim analysis in all 
the primary populations analysed (all-comers, CPS≥1 and CPS≥10), together with statistically 
significant and clinically relevant improvement in OS with the addition of pembrolizumab to 
platinum/paclitaxel chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab as first line treatment of persistent, recurrent or 
metastatic cervical cancer patients not amenable to curative treatment. This was supported by 
improvement in ORR and DOR. However, no benefit is seen in the small PD-L1 negative subgroup, in 
whom the addition of pembrolizumab to standard treatment does not appear justified. As a result, per 
CHMP request, the indication was restricted to CPS≥1 population.

As requested, exposure adjusted AE tables were reported by period and the incidence of AEs in the 
first two intervals (0-3 months and 3-6 months) to take into account the time windows for 
chemotherapy administration. Results showed that the AE profiles of the treatment arms are in 
alignment with the overall findings and no new safety concerns are raised when the exposure is 
adjusted for chemotherapy duration. As expected, some AEs related to myelosuppression (such as 
anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) were seen predominantly in the first 6 
months as these are associated with the chemotherapy components of the combination treatment.

Laboratory findings 
The most frequently reported (≥50%) laboratory abnormalities were similar in the pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy ± bevacizumab group and the placebo + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab group, and the 
majority were CTCAE Grade 1 to 2 toxicity. 
The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy ± 
bevacizumab group were generally similar to the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD, though the 
frequency of these abnormalities was higher in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab 
group. The increased incidence of these abnormalities reflects myelosuppression (decreased white 
blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts) associated with the chemotherapy components of the 
combination treatment.  
No clinically meaningful differences in Grade 3 to 4 laboratory anomalies (incidence ≥0%) were 
observed between the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab and placebo + chemotherapy 
± bevacizumab groups. 
The most frequently reported Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities in the pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy ± bevacizumab group were consistent with myelosuppression (decreased white blood 
cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts), a known risk of the administered chemotherapy. As such, the 
frequencies of these abnormalities in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab group were 
higher compared with the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. 
In KEYNOTE-826, there was no trend in laboratory abnormalities suggesting any safety concerns for 
use of bevacizumab with pembrolizumab + chemotherapy. Although some laboratory abnormalities 
(notably liver function abnormalities and neutropenia) occurred at a higher incidence in participants 
who received bevacizumab compared with those who did not receive bevacizumab, these abnormalities 
were generally consistent with the known safety profile of bevacizumab, and showed a similar trend in 
the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab and the placebo + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab 
groups.

Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period 04-SEP-2019 through 03-SEP-2020, specifically Appendix 20.3 (Numbers of Adverse Reactions 
and Events by Preferred Term from Postauthorization Sources). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  pembrolizumab  (KEYTRUDA®,  MK-3475)  in  combination  with  chemotherapy 
with/without  bevacizumab  for  the  treatment  of  cervical  tumours  in  adults  is  derived  from  the  pivotal 
study KEYNOTE-826. In order to contextualise the study results with respect to the overall toxicity of 
pembrolizumab given as add-on to chemotherapeutic agents, the trial was analysed in comparison with 
a  pooled  safety  dataset  for  pembrolizumab+chemotherapy  including  all  indications  for  which 
pembrolizumab  drug  combinations  are  currently  approved  in  the  EU  (n=2033).  Moreover,  to  better 
characterise  the  contribution  of  pembrolizumab  to  the  adverse  events  associated  with  the  backbone 
therapy,  the  MAH  also  presented  data  by  bevacizumab  use.  Supportive  data  were  also  submitted 
attaining the use of pembrolizumab as monotherapy in the intended indication, which derive from the 
Phase  I  and  II  studies  KN028  (cohort  B4)  and  KN158  (cohort  E)  (n=122);  these  populations  were 
separately analysed from the large pembrolizumab monotherapy reference safety database (RSD=6185) 
that was also presented as comparative group. 
With a cut-off date of 03 May 2021, KEYNOTE-826 includes a total of 616 participants allocated with a 
1:1 randomisation scheme to the active and control arm. The majority of the study population received 
bevacizumab (196 patients, 63.8% in the pembrolizumab+chemotherapy group; 193 patients, 62.4% 
in  the  placebo+chemotherapy  group).  Overall,  exposure  in  the  placebo  group  was  shorter  than  in 
pembrolizumab: 54.6% and 28.5% of total patients in the group of pembrolizumab+chemotherapy with 
and  without  bevacizumab  had  >12-month  exposure  vs  40.9%  and  14.7%  in  the  group  of 
placebo+chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab, respectively. Of note, the use of bevacizumab 
was associated with a longer exposure to treatment in both arms (13.91 months in median vs 6.31 in 
the counterpart in the pembrolizumab arm and 9.69 vs 5.39 months in median in the placebo), likely 
due to a more favourable disease progression conferred by this treatment.  
However, unlike the placebo arm, the pembrolizumab group showed a worse baseline performance score 
in patients not receiving bevacizumab (53.2% with ECOG 1 vs 34.7% with ECOG score 1 in the group 
with bevacizumab), which also could have concurred to the observed shorter length of treatment in this 
subgroup.  Assignment  of  patients  to  bevacizumab  was  an  investigator  decision  driven  by  the  clinical 
conditions at baseline and the expected patient drug tolerability. It is therefore recognised that a poorer 
performance status in patients not receiving bevacizumab compared to those assigned to bevacizumab 
likely  reflects  the  typology  of  patients  generally  excluded  from  treatment.  The  comparative  datasets 
including pembrolizumab monotherapy in both participants with cervical tumour and RSD showed a more 
limited exposure length than study KEYNOTE-826 (>12-month exposure was in the 14.8% and 23.1% 
of  the  dataset,  respectively);  similarly,  the  pooled  pembrolizumab+chemotherapy  database  provided 
data for a 12-month exposure in 27.1% of the recruited population.

According with disease epidemiology and clinical features, cervical tumour patients were younger (above 
80% were aged <65-years compared to 59.9% and 58%) and with better ECOG score (above 50% with 
ECOG score 1 compared to 44.9% and 47.6%) than the pooled pembrolizumab+chemotherapy dataset 
and RSD. 
The analysis of overall adverse events revealed an unfavourable outcome for the experimental therapy 
compared  to  placebo  as  demonstrated  by  increased  frequency  in  grade  3-5  AEs  (81.8%  vs  75.1%), 
drug-related SAEs (30.3% vs 23%) and drug discontinuations (37.5%vs 26.5%) compared to control. 
Of note, fatalities were similar between groups (4.6% vs 4.5%). The rate of AE across all the different 
categories  was  overall  consistent  with  the  pooled  dataset  of  pembrolizumab+chemotherapy.  As 
expected,  the  drug  combination  tested  in  KEYNOTE-826  appeared  worse  than  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy relatively to either the specific indication (cervical monotherapy) or the totality of treated 
patients across all different clinical settings (RSD); the only exception was for the rate of fatalities that 
was higher in the RSD, likely due to the older age and different tumour-specific clinical course of the 
RSD  database.  Exposure  adjusted  results  confirmed  a  potentiating  effect  of  pembrolizumab  on 
chemotherapy-related AEs for what concerns the incidence of grade 3-5 drug-related AEs, drug-related 
SAEs and drug discontinuations due to AEs, all of them occurring with a similar incidence compared to 
the  historical  data  on  combined  therapies  as  defined  by  the  pooled  pembrolizumab+chemotherapy 
dataset. The contribution of the individual component of the drug combination administrated in study 
KEYNOTE-826  varied,  with  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  worsening  the  safety  profile  of 
placebo+chemotherapy, which was further compromised by the addition of pembrolizumab particularly 
for the category of drug discontinuations. Overall, pembrolizumab+chemotherapy without bevacizumab 
appeared similarly tolerated than placebo+chemotherapy with bevacizumab.  
The pattern of AEs was consistent with the known safety profiles of pembrolizumab, chemotherapy and 
bevacizumab. Specifically, alopecia, anaemia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and system nervous disorders 
were  among  the  most  common  (>20%  of  incidence)  side  effects  across  all  chemotherapy  subgroups 
regardless  of  the  use  of  bevacizumab  or  pembrolizumab;  in  patients  receiving  bevacizumab, 
hypertension,  rash,  ALT  increase  and  epistaxis  occurred  more  frequently  than  in  the  absence  of 
bevacizumab; pembrolizumab was associated with a higher rate of endocrine disturbances. Compared 
to the control arm, treatment with pembrolizumab enhanced the incidence of blood and lymphatic system 
disorders (72.3% vs 67.7%), endocrine disturbances (25.7% vs 12.65%), hepatobiliary disorders (6.2% 
vs 4.9%) that were also reflected in the higher incidence of laboratory investigation abnormalities mainly 
related to myelosuppression and liver dysfunction. The majority of these AEs were judged drug-related 
by Investigators. The rate of all these AEs was more frequent than previously reported in the pooled 
dataset of pembrolizumab+chemotherapy, likely because of the longer exposure of study KEYNOTE-826. 
However,  the  exposure-adjusted  analysis  by  bevacizumab  showed  that  pembrolizumab  mainly 
contributed  to  the  endocrine  disturbances,  while  no  impact  of  immunotherapy  was  apparent  for  the 
events in the other SOC categories.  
In  terms  of  severity,  pembrolizumab  mainly  increased  Grade  3-5  AEs  (81.8%  vs  75.1%)  within  the 
SOC  category  of  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (i.e.  anaemia,  neutrophil  count  decrease, 
trombocytopenia,  febrile  neutropenia)  that  are  typically  associated  with  the  use  of  chemotherapeutic 
agents, while toxicity classically related to bevacizumab (i.e. hypertension) was not worsen. Among fatal 
AEs,  however,  the  group  treated  with  pembrolizumab+chemotherapy+bevacizumab  more  frequently 
presented events of cardiac and hemorragic nature in addition to sepsis, relatively to placebo. 
As regards SAEs (50.5% vs 48.6%), events included febrile neutropenia (6.8% vs 4.2%), and anaemia 
(4.6% vs 3.9%) among those that were impaired by pembrolizumab treatment.   
As  expected,  the  incidence  of  AEOSIs  was  more  frequent  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  compared  to 
placebo  (69.23%  vs  40.70%).  The  pattern  of  events  was  typical  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  as 
Assessment report  
EMA/224169/2022  
Page 138/148 
 
 
 
colitis  (6.5%  vs  1.9%),  hepatitis  (1.6%  vs  0.4%),  hyperthyroidism  (7.1%  vs  3.8%),  hypothyroidism 
(19.2% vs 12.1%), severe skin reactions (5% vs 0.4%), and pneumonitis (1.9% vs 0.4%) were among 
the most frequently reported events. There was one death related to AEOSIs in the experimental arm 
(0.3%).  
The rate of AEOSIs (41% vs 26.5%), grade 3-5 AEOSIs (13.4% vs 5.2%), drug-related grade 3-5 AEOSIs 
(11.7% vs 4.2%) and any study drug dose discontinuation due to AESOIs (8.8% vs 3.6%) was above 
the  previously  reported  experience  of  the  pooled  pembrolizumab+chemotherapy  dataset.  These  data 
were confirmed by the exposure-adjusted analysis showing added toxicities for each drug component, 
with  the  combination  of  pembrolizumab+chemotherapy+bevacizumab  displaying  the  worst  safety 
profile, although the only AEOSI-related death occurred in the group of pembrolizumab-treated patients 
not receiving bevacizumab.   
The data show added toxicities for each drug component and the different comparisons might be also 
impacted  by  different  baseline  characteristics  (with  generally  younger  and  fitter  patients  in  the  EC 
indication  compared  to  the  pooled  pembro+chemo  dataset  and  with  also  generally  more  favourable 
baseline  characteristics  for  the  patients  attributed  to  bevacizumab  compared  to  those  without 
bevacizumab).  
The  rate  of  drug  discontinuations  was  higher  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  compared  to  control, 
particularly in association with bevacizumab. The same trend was observable in the control arm.

Analysis by subgroups 
Age: unlike the placebo arm, tolerability within the pembrolizumab treated patient group in combination 
with  chemotherapy  with/without  bevacizumab  worsened  by  age,  as  demonstrated  by  an  increased 
incidence of events across all categories in patients aged >65 years compared to the <65-years of age 
counterpart. However, the requested exposure-adjusted analysis did not reveal significant differences 
between the two categories. The limited numerosity of the sample size for ages >75 years (n=10/arm) 
hampers definitive conclusion in this patient subgroup that, however, has been historically characterised 
by the worse pembrolizumab toxicity when administrated as add-on to chemotherapy.                                                                                     
Sex: considering that the totality of recruited patients were women, a sex-dependent analysis of toxicity 
is of scarce value.                                                                                                                                   
ECOG score: Participants with a higher (1 vs 0) ECOG PS at baseline reported higher frequencies of 
fatalities  in  both  treatment  arms;  pembrolizumab  slightly  augmented  the  toxicity  of  therapy  in  both 
ECOG score categories.                                                                                                                                     
Race: Race does not seem to influence the toxicity profile of either regimens since similar rate of events 
is observable in white and non-white across all AEs categories; pembrolizumab worsened the toxicity of 
chemotherapy regardless of race.                                                                                                    
Region: ex-EU showed a higher incidence of AEs than EU across all categories. No specific causes related 
to different patient management or study conduct between the two geographic areas could be identified. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapy with/without bevacizumab impaired the overall toxicity of 
the backbone therapy with an increased frequency of adverse events than previously reported in other 
indications for which pembrolizumab+chemotherapy was licenced. The safety profile of the experimental 
treatment used in study KEYNOTE-826 reflected the established toxicity of the individual components of 
the  drug  combination.  No  new  safety  signals  emerged.  AEOSI  were  more  frequent  than  previously 
registered  in  other  chemotherapy/pembrolizumab  associations,  mainly  with  the  concomitant  use  of 
bevacizumab. As expected, an age-dependent reduction in tolerability was observed. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer not amenable to curative treatment, first line. 
The adopted indication is “KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab, 
is indicated for the treatment of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer in adults whose 
tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1”. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Cisplatin-based doublets with topotecan or paclitaxel have demonstrated superiority to cisplatin 
monotherapy as first line treatment of advanced/metastatic cancer, with cisplatin plus paclitaxel the 
preferred regimen based on the balance between efficacy and toxicity profile (ESMO GL; Monk BJ, 
2009). The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin could be considered an alternative for patients 
that are not candidates for cisplatin. The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy significantly 
prolonged overall survival as compared chemotherapy alone, at the expenses of higher toxicity (Tewari 
KS, 2014). The triplet combination bevacizumab-cisplatin-paclitaxel is considered the preferred first-
line regimen in metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer (ESMO, NCCN). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-826: a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin plus paclitaxel) with or without bevacizumab vs placebo plus 
chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for the 1L treatment of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic 
cervical cancer. Results of interim analysis 1 support the extension of indication application. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
• 
Statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in OS in all the populations analysed 
(all-comers, CPS≥1, CPS≥10: in CPS≥1 OS HR 0.64, median OS NR (19.8, NR) vs 16.3 (14.5, 19.4) 
(gain in median OS of 8 months in the all-comers population), KM curves separated at month 3 
and remain in favour of pembrolizumab combination. 
•  Statistically significant improvement in PFS by investigator for the addition of pembrolizumab to 
chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab in all the populations analysed (all-comers, CPS≥1, CPS≥10): in 
CPS≥1 PFS HR 0.62, gain in median PFS of 2 months.  
•  Supportive ORR and DOR trends: 18% increase in ORR, median DOR 18 vs 10.4 months in the 
CPS≥1 population. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  Acknowledging the small number of subjects (34 vs 34), apparent lack of benefit in CPS<1 
population: OS HR 1, PFS HR 0.94, ORR difference -6.4%, DOR 10.7 vs 8.5. This lack of benefit of 
Assessment report

pembrolizumab in PD-L1 CPS<1 is supported by biological plausibility and external data 
(KEYNOTE-158). As a result, the MAH restricted the indication to CPS≥1 population.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
• 
increased frequency in grade 3-5 AEs (81.8% vs 75.1%), drug-related SAEs (30.3% vs 23%) and 
drug discontinuations (37.5% vs 26.5%) in the group of pembrolizumab+chemotherapy 
with/without bevacizumab compared to the control arm 
•  alopecia, anaemia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and neuropathies were among the most common 
(>20% of incidence) side effects across all chemotherapy subgroups regardless of the use of 
bevacizumab or pembrolizumab 
• 
in patients receiving bevacizumab, hypertension, rash, ALT increase and hepixtasis occurred more 
frequently than in the absence of bevacizumab in both treatment arms 
•  Compared to the control arm, treatment with pembrolizumab enhanced the incidence of blood and 
lymphatic system disorders (72.3% vs 67.7%), endocrine disturbances (25.7% vs 12.65%), 
hepatobiliary disorders (6.2% vs 4.9%) 
•  Pembrolizumab mainly increased Grade 3-5 AEs (81.8% vs 75.1%) within the SOC category of 
blood and lymphatic system disorders (i.e. anaemia, neutrophil count decrease, trombocytopenia, 
febrile neutropenia)  
•  As regards SAEs (50.5% vs 48.6%), events included febrile neutropenia (6.8% vs 4.2%), and 
anaemia (4.6% vs 3.9%) among those impaired by pembrolizumab treatment 
• 
the incidence of AEOSIs was more frequent in the pembrolizumab group compared to placebo 
(69.23% vs 40.70%). The pattern of events is typical of pembrolizumab monotherapy as colitis 
(6.5% vs 1.9%), hepatitis (1.6% vs 0.4%), hyperthyroidism (7.1% vs 3.8%), hypothyroidism 
(19.2% vs 12.1%), severe skin reactions (5% vs 0.4%), and pneumonitis (1.9% vs 0.4%) were 
among the most frequently reported events. 
•  The rate of AEOSIs (41% vs 26.5%), grade 3-5 AEs (13.4% vs 5.2%), drug-related grade 3-5 AEs 
(11.7% vs 4.2%) and any study drug dose discontinuation due to AESOIs (8.8% vs 3.6%) was 
above the previously reported experience of the pooled pembrolizumab+chemotherapy dataset. 
These data were confirmed by the exposure-adjusted analysis and with the combination of 
pembrolizumab+chemotherapy+bevacizumab displaying the worst safety profile.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapy with/without bevacizumab in the pivotal study KEYNOTE-
826 demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS at the interim 
analysis, supported by statistically significant PFS and positive ORR and DOR trends as compared to 
placebo+chemotherapy with/without bevacizumab. Such results were observed consistently in all the 
populations analysed (all-comers, CPS≥1 and CPS≥10). However, the results in the all-comers 
population are driven by PD-L1 positive disease, as apparent lack of benefit is observed in patients 
with PD-L1 negative tumours (CPS<1). Acknowledging that this represent only a small subgroup not 
included in the multiplicity strategy, biological plausibility is supported by the results of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in 2L cervical cancer. The MAH has restricted the indication to CPS≥1 population. 
Although results were from interim analysis, the median follow up, number of events and subjects who 
had discontinued treatment are considered sufficient to conclude on the B/R in the sought indication in 
view of the overall data provided. All the populations analysed for efficacy impaired the overall toxicity 
of the backbone therapy with an increased frequency of adverse events than previously reported in 
other indications for which pembrolizumab+chemotherapy was licenced. The safety profile of the 
experimental treatment used in study KEYNOTE-826 reflected the established toxicity of the individual 
components of the drug combination. No new safety signals emerged. AEOSI were more frequent than 
previously reported in other chemotherapy/pembrolizumab associations, mainly observed with the 
concomitant use of bevacizumab. As expected, an age-dependent reduction in tolerability was 
observed. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Relevant benefit is observed from the experimental therapy as compared to standard treatment for 
first line treatment of persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. However, the CPS<1 
population did not appear to benefit from the addition of pembrolizumab to standard treatment. 
Despite the add-on toxicity, the benefit outweighs the risks in the PD-L1 CPS≥1 population.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
According to data utilization provided by the MAH, the use of platinum doublet in 1L +/- bevacizumab 
is the standard of care globally, and platinum-paclitaxel doublet is the most used chemotherapy 
doublet worldwide. The use of topotecan in 1L (which can be associated with paclitaxel and 
bevacizumab in 1L cervical cancer as per bevacizumab label) appears limited and this drug tends to be 
used as monotherapy in 2L or 3L.  
Based on prior experience for pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, it has been observed 
that safety of combination regimens usually reflects the established toxicity of the individual 
components of the combined drug. As a result, physicians experienced in the use of anticancer drugs 
might be expected to be able to manage side effect of a combination with anti-PD(L)1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/224169/2022  
Page 146/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On the other hand, uncertainties might be raised due to the lack of safety data for the combination 
with any topotecan-based regimens, along with difficulties to conclude on the possibility to extrapolate 
from irinotecan to topotecan. However, any combination with topotecan-based treatment might be 
expected to be limited in clinical practice, as discussed above.   
With regard to efficacy aspects, it seems unlikely that the added benefit of pembrolizumab would 
change if added to one or another regimen considered active in a certain disease/setting.  
To conclude, the B/R can be considered positive for general use “in combination with chemotherapy” 
as in the sought indication. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for the 
treatment of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer in adults in PD-L1 CPS≥1 population is 
positive.

This is a group of variations including an extension of indication to include monotherapy and adjunctive 
therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in children 
from 4 to less than 16 years old with epilepsy. For the treatment initiation pack it is proposed to 
extend only adjunctive treatment to adolescents weighting more than 50 kg (not suitable for 
monotherapy and children and adolescents weighting less than 50 kg). As a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition and only for the syrup presentation, section 6.3 of the SmPC is updated due to a proposed 
extension of shelf life of finished product after first opening from 4 weeks to 6 months. Moreover, a 10 
mL dosing syringe for the 200 ml and the 465 ml syrup bottles is introduced as additional dosing 
device for paediatric population; section 6.5 of the SmPC of the syrup presentations is updated 
accordingly. Finally, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring Annex IIIA 
in line with the latest QRD template version 10 and to introduce combined SmPC for the film coated 
tablets. Moreover, an updated RMP version 12 has been submitted. 
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0183/2015 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0183/2015 was not yet completed as some

measures were deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Vimpat contains the active substance lacosamide (LCM, [R]-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-
methoxypropionamide), an amino acid derivative with anticonvulsive activity. While its precise 
mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, LCM has been shown to enhance slow inactivation 
of voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby increasing activation thresholds and stabilizing hyper-
excitable neuronal membranes. This effect is thought to help preventing neuronal seizure activity.   
Vimpat has been authorised in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area through the 
centralised procedure by Commission Decision in August 2008.  It is approved as monotherapy and 
adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without secondary 
generalization in adult and adolescent (16 to 18 years) patients with epilepsy. Vimpat is available as 
tablets (50mg, 100mg, 150mg, and 200mg), solution for infusion (10mg/mL), and syrup (10mg/mL). 
Treatment is initiated at a starting dose of 50 mg twice a day (bid) which is titrated in weekly 
increments to a maximum maintenance dose of 200 mg bid (adjunctive therapy) or 300 mg bid 
(monotherapy).  
Epilepsy is a heterogeneous and serious brain disorder characterised by the occurrence of unprovoked 
recurrent seizures. POS are focal seizures which are initially confined to a discrete area of the cerebral 
cortex, but may spread to involve both cerebral hemispheres resulting in a secondary generalisation. 
Amongst the estimated 50 million people worldwide affected by epilepsy, partial epilepsies account for 
approximately 20 to 66% of incidence epilepsies in population based studies, representing the most 
predominant seizure type both in children and adults (Forsgren et al, 1996; Banerjee et al, 2009; 
Kotsopoulos et al, 2002). POS may present as simple or complex seizures, depending on whether 
consciousness is affected. They can manifest as motor, sensory, automatic or psychic symptoms and, 
in case of secondary generalisation, as absences, tonic, clonic, tonic-clonic, myoclonic or tonic 
seizures.  
Half of the epilepsies begin before the age of 18 years. The incidence is highest in the first year of life 
and declines throughout childhood. Within the first year of life, the incidence rates range between 56.8 
and 318 per 100,000 person-years whereas in children aged between 10 and 19 years, the incidence 
rate ranges between 35 and 58 per 100,000 person-years (Dura-Trave et al, 2008; Forsgren et al, 
2005). The mortality rate in children with epilepsy is higher than the general population. One of the 
factors contributing to the increased mortality is the occurrence of sudden unexpected death in people 
with epilepsy (SUDEP) with an estimated incidence of 2 per 10,000 person-years in children with 
epilepsy (Donner et al, 2001). 
Epilepsy in children can differ from epilepsy in adults in terms of brain maturation, occurrence of 
seizure types not seen in adults and childhood epilepsy syndromes. With regards to POS however it is 
accepted that the clinical expression is similar in adults and adolescents and children down to the age 
of 4 years (Guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic 
disorders, Rev.2/Corr., 2010, hereafter referred to as CHMP Epilepsy Guideline). The CHMP Epilepsy 
Guideline furthermore states that in refractory focal epilepsies, the results of efficacy trials performed 
in adults could to some extent be extrapolated to children provided the dose is established. 
Pharmacological treatment of epilepsy aims at achieving seizure control or at least a reduction of the 
seizure burden. Treatment is usually initiated with monotherapy and, if seizures are not adequately

Page 9/78 
 
 
 
 
 
controlled after two or three monotherapy regimens, a combination of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is 
tried. Despite numerous treatment options for POS in children, more than 25% of paediatric patients 
have inadequate seizure control on currently available AEDs or experience significant adverse drug 
effects (Hadjiloizou and Bourgeois, 2007). 
In this application, the MAH proposed an extension of the indication to children with epilepsy and POS, 
aged 4 to less than 16 years. The application is based on extrapolation of efficacy from adults to 
paediatric patients as supported by pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 2 phase I/II studies in paediatric 
patients (studies SP847 and SP1047) and related PK modeling and simulations, as well as clinical 
safety data generated in paediatric epilepsy patients (SP847, SP848 and EP0034).  
2.2.  Quality  aspects  
In connection with the application for a paediatric indication for the Vimpat products, quality changes 
to the Vimpat 10 mg/ml syrup formulation were proposed. To be able to accurately administer the 
smaller doses/volumes required for children from 4 years of age and adolescents weighing less than 50 
kg, a plastic 10 ml syringe with bottle adaptor as an additional device was introduced. In addition, to 
account for the fact that small volumes of the syrup will be administered to children an extended in-
use shelf-life was applied for. 
Introduction of an additional measuring device  
The new syringe dosing device is CE marked (Class I non-sterile medical device with measuring 
function according to Annex IX, rule 5 of Directive 93/42/EEC) and consists of a polypropylene barrel, 
a high density polyethylene plunger, and a low density polyethylene bottle adaptor. The dosing device 
complies with Ph Eur 3.2.2 Plastic containers and closures for pharmaceutical use. It has graduations 
from 1 ml to 10 ml (10 mg to 100 mg lacosamide) in 0.25 ml (2.5 mg lacosamide) intervals.  
Dose accuracy has been determined at 1 ml, 5 ml and 10 ml according to Ph Eur 2.9.27 Uniformity of 
mass of delivered doses for multidose containers. Acceptable accuracy was obtained at these three 
volume levels. Volumes less than 1 ml (corresponding to the dose for a child of 10 kg body weight) 
cannot be administered with this syringe graduation.  
Extension of the shelf life of the finished product 
An in-use shelf-life of 4 weeks is currently approved for Vimpat 10mg/ml syrup. Children from 4 years 
of age and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg will be treated with lower doses compared to children 
and adolescents weighing 50 kg or more and adults. Thus, children weighing <50 kg will take a smaller 
volume of the syrup per day compared to adults. As a consequence of the lower dose more than 4 
weeks will be needed to consume the full content of a bottle (200 ml or 465 ml fill volume). To support 
an extension of the shelf life after first opening, a new in-use stability study was performed.  
The new in-use stability study was performed up to six months. Two batches of Vimpat 10mg/ml syrup 
200ml bottles have been tested. Stability data on one (“fresh”) batch are available. The study with the 
storage conditions “controlled room temperature 20-25°C with excursions allowed between 15-30°C” 
was performed by withdrawing 0.7 ml from the bottle twice daily (work days) for six months. The 
samples were analysed monthly over six months according to the shelf-life specification for 
appearance, odour, colour, clarity, pH, chromatographic purity, assay, preservative (sodium methyl 
parahydroxybenzoate) content, and microbiological quality. No changes in any of the tested 
parameters were observed during the six months’ study. However, taking into account the lowest 
recommended dose specified in the revised SmPC (body weight of 10 kg), an in-use shelf life of two 
months would be sufficient and was therefore agreed. SmPC section 6.3 was updated accordingly. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/124678/2017  
Page 10/78 
 
 
 
 
 
Although the Note for guidance on in-use stability testing of human medicinal products 
(CPMP/QWP/2934/99) requires data on two batches of which one should be chosen towards the end of 
its shelf life, the MAH considered that the in-use stability data on one “fresh” batch are sufficiently 
supportive to justify the extension to six months because previous stability studies of the product have 
shown that all parameters, except desmethyl-lacosamide and total degradation products, show little to 
no variability during the shelf life of the product.  
The MAH commits to perform a second in-use stability study on one batch towards the end of shelf life 
in accordance with the Note for Guidance on In-Use Stability Testing of Human Medicinal Products 
(CPMP/QWP/2934/99). The MAH agreed on providing the data of a batch towards the end of shelf life, 
which was placed in storage and for which the in-use testing will be conducted prior to product expiry, 
upon request of the Health Authority or in case of an Out of Specification or Out of Trend result.  
Palatability and ease of use 
In SP848, palatability and ease of use for LCM in paediatric subjects were analysed as part of the 
interim analysis. Overall and by age group, the majority of subjects responded to the palatability and 
ease of use questionnaire favourably for both the tablet and the syrup formulations of LCM.  
The majority of subjects responded that the tablet’s smell was acceptable (95.8%), the tablet was 
easy to swallow (81.9%), they did not become nauseous or vomit after taking the tablet (88.9% and 
97.2%, respectively), and that there was no taste while the tablet was in the subject’s mouth or an 
aftertaste (68.1% and 77.8%, respectively). 
The majority of subjects responded that the syrup had an acceptable smell (97.9%), was easy to 
swallow (57.4%), and did not cause them to become nauseous or to vomit (66.0% and 91.5%, 
respectively). For the 42.6% of subjects who responded that there was a taste while the syrup was in 
their mouths, 21.3% considered the taste “ok”, 17.0% “bad”, and 6.4% “good”. For the subjects who 
provided responses to the question of whether the syrup had an unpleasant aftertaste, 25.5% 
considered the aftertaste to be unpleasant and 29.8% did not consider the aftertaste to be unpleasant. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Toxicology 
In addition to the non-clinical safety package provided with initial marketing authorisation application, 
two new pre-and post-natal studies in rats (studies NCD2008 and NCD2103), and one new juvenile 
study in dogs (LPT20615) have been conducted in support of this application. The original application 
also included two juvenile rat studies, which are relevant to this application (see Table 1).

Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
In a previously submitted study in rats (1108-004), in which animals were dosed up to 200 mg/kg 
once daily by oral gavage, the mean duration of gestation was significantly prolonged in the treated 
groups (22.8, 22.9 and 23.0 days, respectively), compared with the control group (22.4 days). Also, 
an increase in numbers of stillborn pups and pup deaths in the peri-partum period, and a slightly 
reduced live litter sizes and pup body weights were observed at a maternally toxic dose of 200 
mg/kg/day. No effects were noted on the F2 generation up to weaning. The No Observed Adverse 
Effect Level (NOAEL) for maternal and developmental toxicity was 70 mg/kg/day, for development, 
fertility and reproduction of F1 generation it was >200 mg/kg/day. At NOAEL, 70 mg/kg/day, the 
margin to maximum human exposure based on Cmax was 2.3 and no margin for area under the curve 
(AUC) values was established. At NOAEL >200 mg/kg/day, the margins over human maximum 
exposure (200 mg bid) was 3.0 based on Cmax, and no margin based on AUC levels. 
Amongst the two new pre- and post-natal development rat studies, was one dose-finding rat study 
(NCD2008) investigating daily doses of 100 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg compared to vehicle. 
The daily dose level of 500 mg/kg/day clearly exceeded the maximum tolerated dose as all animals 
were found dead or euthanized before parturition. At 300 mg/kg/day, maternal toxicity (1 death, CNS-
related clinical signs, body weight loss and reduced food consumption), longer gestation length, and 
neonatal toxicity (low litter size, low birth weights and postnatal survival) were noted. The F 1 pups 
showed clinical signs, including hypothermia, cyanosis and gasping. At 100 mg/kg/day, a transient 
reduction of maternal body weight gains and reduced food consumption were observed. No test item-
related effects were reported on F1 pup survival, birth weights or clinical signs. Based on these results, 
daily dose levels of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day were selected for the pivotal pre- and post-natal 
study.  
In the definitive study (NCD2103), the NOAEL for F0 maternal systemic  effects was considered to be 
50 mg/kg/day based on F0 clinical signs, body weight losses and lower body weight gains and food 
consumption at doses at and above 100 mg/kg/day. Furthermore, increased F0  mortality at 
200 mg/kg/day was observed. Following treatment of the dams at 200 mg/kg/day, the F 1 generation 
presented lower postnatal survival (including total litter loss), lower birth and pup body weights and a 
transient decrease in learning performance for females only during post-natal day (PND) 22 Biel maze 
testing. This effect was not observed on PND62 and it was therefore concluded that there were no 
persistent effects on learning ability. There were no LCM-related  macroscopic or microscopic changes 
in the F1 animals, including no changes in brain structure, at any dose level. The NOAEL for 
neurobehavioral and developmental toxicity was  considered to be 100 mg/kg/day, corresponding to ~ 
1.4 times higher than exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of  400 mg/day 
based on AUC. Due to the absence of effects on reproductive performance at any dosage 200

mg/kg/day was considered to be the NOAEL for F1 reproductive toxicity and F2 development. The 
exposure of the F1 pups was 6% to 8% of the exposure of the lactating F0 females, whatever the dose.  
Studies in the offspring (juvenile animals)  
Amongst the two rat juvenile studies, which had already been submitted at the time of the initial 
marketing authorisation application, was one dose range finding and a definite study. 
In the juvenile rat dose-finding study (LPT 18601/04), rats were treated from PND 7 for 6 weeks (30, 
100 or 300 mg/kg/day), or from PND 14 for 5 weeks (100 mg/kg/day). All dosed animals were 
exposed to LCM and its desmethyl metabolite (SPM 12809).  
In rats treated from PND7, signs of toxicity in form of reduced motility and reduced body temperature 
were noted starting at 100 mg/kg/day. Body weight was reduced by up to 17% in males and 20% in 
females in the intermediate dose group and by up to 57% in males and 52% in females in the high 
dose group. In addition, the high dosed animals revealed tremor, pilo-erection and a thickened 
abdomen on single test days during the treatment period. The changes observed for the absolute and 
relative brain weights of the animals of the intermediate and high dose groups are likely to be due to 
the markedly reduced body weight of the animals and, therefore, to be a secondary effect of a delayed 
development of the animals in general. At the high dose of 300 mg/kg/day, 1 of 5 males and 2 of 5 
females died prematurely during the treatment period (after weaning). In the high dosed animals 
(main study, satellite and reserve/replacement animals) an increased mortality was also observed 
before weaning (during treatment with 300 mg/kg/day from post-natal day 7 to day 21), which is 
considered related to LCM treatment. The NOAL was determined to be 30 mg/kg/day. 
Treatment at 100 mg/kg/day starting on PND 14 for 5 weeks until day 48 did not result in reduced 
body weight or body weight gain and, accordingly, also no significant changes in absolute and relative 
brain weights. The body temperature was also not affected. Other toxicological endpoints were not 
influenced, i.e., comparable to treatment with the same dose for 6 weeks starting on PND 7. There 
were no test item-related histopathological changes in the brains of any of the animals investigated, 
including all prematurely deceased (after weaning) and terminally sacrificed high dosed animals. 
In the pivotal juvenile rat study (LPT 18602/04), rats were treated with LCM and its desmethyl 
metabolite (SPM 12809) from PND 7 for 6 weeks with a 4-week recovery period (30, 90 or 180 
mg/kg/day).  
Treatment at ≥90 mg/kg/day led to an increased alkaline phosphatase plasma level. In addition, 
increased plasma cholesterol levels as well as an increased alanine transaminase activity were noted at 
180 mg/kg/day. The body weight of the high dosed animals was reduced by up to 19% in males and 
females compared to the control. Food consumption of the high dosed animals appeared to be slightly 
increased during the first week after weaning. 
The assessment of post-natal physical development (incisor eruption, eye opening, cleavage of the 
balanopreputial gland, vaginal opening) revealed a slightly delayed (approx. 2.5 days) vaginal opening 
in the high dosed female animals. This finding corresponds to the reduced body weight in the high 
dosed females and is therefore regarded to be likely a secondary effect of a slightly delayed 
development of the high dosed animals in general. 
The assessment of post-natal neurological development in the open field test 8 days after cessation of 
dosing revealed a slightly decreased latency time to move from the center sector at ≥90 mg/kg/day, 
i.e., the time of orientation and to start to explore a new environment is shorter than in the control 
animals. This observation suggests an anxiolytic effect of LCM. Behaviour, drinking water consumption,

haematology, urinalysis and bone marrow as well as ophthalmological and auditory function, 
observational neurological screening, locomotor activity, grip strength and learning and memory in the 
water maze test were not affected by LCM administration and there was no biologically relevant effect 
on the organ weights. 
No test item-related clinical signs were noted. None of the main study or recovery animals died 
prematurely during the course of the study (after weaning). No treatment-related effect was noted on 
the number of pups that died during the lactation period. 
Macroscopic inspection at necropsy did not reveal any test item-related changes in the brain, the 
gonads, the heart or in any other organ or tissue. The histomorphological examination at the end of 
the 6-week treatment period did not reveal any morphological lesions which are considered related to 
the administration of the test item. There were no test item-related findings in the brain, the gonads, 
the heart or in any other organ or tissue. 
The NOAEL was determined at 90 mg/kg/day.  
In a previously submitted juvenile dog dose-finding study (LPT 20614/06), Beagle dogs were treated 
from an age of 8 weeks for 6 weeks at dose levels of 5, 10 or 25 mg/kg/day administered orally by 
capsule. None of the animals died prematurely during the course of the study. At the high dose of 25 
mg/kg/day most animals showed a staggering gait, slight tremor, lateral position, slight tonic or clonic-
tonic convulsions, indurated abdominal wall and emesis on a few test days. No LCM-related effect was 
noted at any of the tested dose levels on the body weight, body weight gain and growth parameters 
(shoulder height, tibia and femur length), bone mineral content, area or density, food and water 
consumption, reflex and neurofunctional testing, heart rate and electrical complexes of the ECG, blood 
pressure, haematological, biochemical and urinary parameters, relative and absolute organ weights 
and macroscopic and microscopic examinations including detailed examination of the brain and heart. 
Isolated second-degree atrioventricular (AV) blocks were recorded in very few cases in a few animals 
of the treatment groups before start of treatment as well as pre-dose and after test item 
administration on test days 1 and 13 but not on test day 42. In line with the observed low incidence 
and occurrence before test item administration, this finding has been reported to be an occasional 
spontaneous finding in Beagle dogs, especially between 8 and 11 weeks of age. In conclusion, the 
dose-range-finding study in juvenile dogs did not reveal any evidence of age-specific or developmental 
toxicity. As in adult animals, clinical signs such as convulsions are considered dose-limiting in juvenile 
dogs. However, the clinical signs tended to weaken after the first week of administration. The NOAEL 
for the juvenile dogs in this study was 10 mg/kg/day.  
The new pivotal juvenile dog study (LPT 20615), was a 33-week chronic toxicity study of LCM by 
repeated oral administration to juvenile Beagle dogs (age at start of administration 7 - 8 weeks) with a 
4-week recovery period. LCM was administered at 3, 10 or 25 mg/kg/kg orally once daily, which was 
expected to yield dose-limiting clinical signs based on the results of LPT20614/06. However, clinical 
signs tended to weaken after the first week of administration. Therefore, the high dose was increased 
to 30 mg/kg/day from Week 2 onwards and to 35 mg/kg/day from Day 60 onwards. Additionally 
50/60/70 mg/kg/day was administered orally twice daily (bid) in 2 equally divided doses given 
approximately 10 hours apart.  
None of the animals died prematurely. None of the dogs treated at 3 mg/kg/day revealed any test 
item-related clinical signs of systemic toxicity, and treatment at 10 mg/kg/day led to emesis, lateral 
position, convulsions, tremor, shaking head or salivation in very few animals on single test days only. 
Treatment with either 25/30/35 or 2 x 25/30/35 mg/kg/day led to the following behavioural changes 
(observed most frequently): tonic convulsions, emesis, lateral position, a pale gingiva, salivation, 
Assessment report

staggering gait, tremor, shaking of the head, uncontrolled defecation, urination and/or vocalization, 
ataxia, abdominal position, chewing movements, clonic or clonic-tonic convulsions, hemorrhagic feces, 
irregular respiration, and reduced reflexes were noted. There was no difference in the incidence and 
severity of the changes between the 2 groups. The convulsions and emesis were considered dose-
limiting. No clinical signs were observed during the 4-week recovery period. There was no LCM-related 
effect on body weights, body weight gain, food and water the growth parameters, the reflex and 
neurofunctional testing, the parameters of haematology and clinical biochemistry, the urinalysis, the 
electrocardiography, the circulatory functions, the ophthalmological examination, the organ weights, 
the macroscopic and microscopic evaluations and bone evaluation (mineral content, area and density). 
Exposure levels in juvenile animals were in the same range as those previously observed in adult dogs. 
At the highest dosage level of 70 mg/kg/day, systemic exposure levels in the juvenile dogs were 
slightly below exposure at the MRHD of 400 mg/day, based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. 
Accordingly, NOAEL for juvenile animals was 10 mg/kg/day and NOAEL for developmental parameters 
of juvenile animals was 2×25/30/35 mg/kg/day.  
Exposure margins  
Exposure margins (based on Cmax and AUC) were calculated versus the MRHD for adjunctive POS 
therapy (LCM 400 mg/day; 200 mg bid) and for monotherapy (LCM 600 mg/day; 300 mg bid) as 
below.

2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated ERA has previously been provided in the context of variation 
EMEA/H/C/000863/II/0060/G, in which the market penetration factor (Fpen) had been refined based on 
published prevalence data (World Health Organisation, 2007) and Forsgren et al (2005) taking into 
account both data from adults and paediatrics epilepsy patients as well as add-on and monotherapy 
settings. Thus, the extended target population applied for in this application has already been 
accounted for. The conclusions from the previous assessment, namely that there was no significant 
increase in environmental exposure and that that LCM is unlikely to present a risk to the terrestrial and 
aquatic environments remain valid. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In support of the paediatric clinical development program, non-clinical juvenile toxicity studies in rats 
and dogs were performed. In the juvenile rat studies, dosing was initiated at an age of 7 days. A 7-
days-old rat corresponds (approximately) to a term neonate based on overall CNS and reproductive 
development.  In the juvenile dog study, dosing was initiated at an age of 7 to 8 weeks corresponding 
(approximately) to a 2 year-old child. The MAH also refers to pre- and post-natal studies in rats with 
administration of LCM in utero and via milk for up to 3 weeks, corresponding to a human age of 0-2 
years. The exposure of the F1 pups was ~ 6% to 8% of the exposure of the lactating F0 females, 
whatever the dose. In summary, the non-clinical juvenile studies are considered to adequately cover 
the age of the intended patient population of 4 years and above.  
Clinical signs 
In the juvenile dogs, similar to adult dogs, CNS clinical signs such as tonic convulsions, emesis, lateral 
position, staggering gait, and tremor were considered dose-limiting. In contrast, only few clinical signs 
were observed in the juvenile rats and despite initially higher exposure these were less severe than at 
comparable dose levels in adult rats where (similar to dogs) exaggerated pharmacological effects on 
the CNS were dose-limiting. As in the non-clinical studies and clinical studies in adults, CNS side 
effects are likely to be predominant in clinical studies with paediatric subjects as well. Nervous system 
disorders are already described as very common/common in section 4.8 of the SmPC of Vimpat. 
Body weight and growth parameters 
In the juvenile dogs, there was no LCM-related effect on body weight, body weight gain or growth 
parameters (shoulder height, tibia and femur length). In contrast, in juvenile rats, marked reductions 
in body weight and body weight gain were dose-limiting. As a secondary effect to this, a slightly 
delayed development of the high-dose groups in general was observed but appeared not to result in 
any functional consequences. Body weight tended to recover over the course of the study, however, 
recovery was not complete until study termination. The MAH speculates that one possible cause for the 
reduced body weight could be reduced suckling during lactation due to effects on the CNS which in 
adult rats are usually seen as convulsions, ataxia, lateral/abdominal position, etc. but may not be very 
well observable in the very young animals. In addition, systemic exposure to LCM was shown to be 
higher during the first week(s) of treatment compared to the end of treatment in juvenile rats, 
potentially due to lower renal elimination in the very young animals. Therefore, it may be agreed that 
the effect on body weight is a consequence of the general toxicity of LCM, rather than a specific effect 
on juvenile growth. Similar findings were observed in adult animals at the maximum tolerated dose. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/124678/2017  
Page 16/78 
 
 
 
 
 
this context, it is noteworthy that, when treatment with LCM was started on PND 14 for 5 weeks (as 
opposed to start of treatment on PND 7 for 6 weeks), there was no influence on body weight (gain). At 
this age (i.e., 14 days), systemic exposure is already “moderate”, pups are much more active per se, 
and they already consume food pellets in addition to suckling. 
Central nervous system (CNS) 
Potential effects of long-term treatment with LCM on the developing brain were assessed in a pre- and 
post-natal study in rats and repeat-dose toxicity studies in juvenile rats and dogs. These studies 
included detailed CNS histopathology after perfusion fixation as well as observational neurological 
screening, reflex testing and a series of neurofunctional tests: 
A 6-week toxicity study was performed in juvenile rats with start of dosing on PND , which covered the 
most relevant period for CNS development in rats, especially for cognitive development and delayed 
response learning, ie, between PND 10 and 35. No age-specific adverse events were observed at any 
dose tested up to about 2.9- and 1.1-times human exposure (at 300 mg bid in adults) based on Cmax 
and AUC, respectively. The evaluation of the open field test performed 8 days after cessation of dosing 
suggested anxiolytic-like action in the intermediate and high-dose group but no other LCM-related 
changes in behaviour or activity were observed. In previous secondary pharmacology studies, LCM was 
active in the stress-induced hyperthermia model for stress-related anxiety in mice but not in two other 
models for anxiety in rats, the social interaction and the elevated plus maze tests. Thus the relevance 
of potential anxiolytic-like effects of LCM in rats remains equivocal. No macroscopic or 
histopathological findings were noted in the brain. In a 33-week study in juvenile Beagle dogs with 
start of dosing post-weaning at an age of 7-8 weeks, there were no LCM-related findings upon reflex 
and neurofunctional testing (with exception of increased salivation) up to the highest dose tested 
corresponding to about 1.4- and 0.6-times human exposure (at 300 mg bid in adults) based on Cmax 
and AUC, respectively. Also, there were no macroscopic or histopathological findings in the brain. 
In addition, in a previous pre- and post-natal reprotoxicological study in rats there were no statistically 
significant or biologically important differences in learning, short-term retention, long-term retention or 
response inhibition in the (untreated) F1 rats. The F0 females were treated up to 200 mg/kg/day 
corresponding to about 3.0- and 0.6-times human exposure (at 200 mg bid in adults) based on Cmax 
and AUC, respectively. In a second pre- and post-natal study in rats, a slight, transient decrease in 
learning performance was noted only for females in the 200 mg/kg/day group at PND 22. No effect 
was noted for females or for males at 200 mg/kg/day or at lower dosages during the PND 62 
assessment. There were no changes in brain structure as investigated by histomorphological 
techniques nor in brain weights at any dosage level. The NOAEL for neurobehavioral assessment (100 
mg/kg/day) corresponds to approximately 2 and 1.4-fold human exposure (at 200 mg bid in adults) 
based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. Other AEDs, eg sulthiame, valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital, 
diazepam, clonazepam and vigabatrin, have been reported to cause widespread and dose-dependent 
apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain during the brain growth spurt period. This 
period has been covered in the juvenile rat study at therapeutically relevant concentrations and no 
neurodegenerative effects were observed. 
Heart and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
Effects on ECG-complexes, especially the PR-interval, and/or heart development might be considered a 
potential concern with LCM in paediatric subjects based on previously submitted data. In safety 
pharmacology studies, transient increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration and decreases in 
blood pressure most likely due to a cardio depressive action were observed after intravenous (i.v.) 
administration in anesthetized dogs. These transient changes started in the same concentration range 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/124678/2017  
Page 17/78 
 
 
 
 
 
as after maximum recommended clinical dosing. In anesthetized dogs and monkeys, at i.v. doses of 15 
to 60 mg/kg, slowing of atrial and ventricular conductivity, AV block and AV dissociation were seen. 
Thus, ECGs were recorded in the juvenile dog studies on different test days prior and after dosing at 
around t max and a detailed histopathology was included in both studies with juvenile rats and dogs. In 
the dogs, second degree AV-blocks were recorded in a few cases in a few animals of all dose groups 
including the control group before and after test item administration during the first weeks of the 
study. This finding, including some other isolated arrhythmias, is considered spontaneous and 
incidental findings common to young Beagle dogs. Further, there were no LCM-related findings in the 
heart upon macroscopical or histopathological examination neither in the dog nor in the rat. In both 
species, development of cardiac innervation was covered in the respective studies, i. e. up to 5 weeks 
or 4 months of age in rats and dogs. Taken together, data from these non-clinical studies have not 
identified any specific age-related risk with regard to cardiac safety of LCM. Cardiac adverse events are 
included as an important identified risk in the RMP and cardiac AEs are monitored using both routine 
and enhanced pharmacovigilance measures.  
Reproductive system 
In the juvenile rats treated from PND 7 to 48, i. e. through puberty, a slight delay in vaginal opening 
was observed which is considered secondary to the dose-limiting body weight reduction and thereby 
reflecting a slightly delayed development of the high-dose groups in general rather than a specific 
effect on the female reproductive system. This is further supported by the lack of any test substance-
related effects on reproductive function assessed in a subgroup of males and females after sexual 
maturation and the lack of any histopathological findings. The NOAEL for reproductive function of the 
previously treated juvenile males and females as well as for the early embryonic development of the 
respective (untreated) litters was 180 mg/kg/day corresponding to about 2.9- and 1.1- times human 
exposure (at 300 mg bid in adults) based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. In addition, there were no 
test item-related histopathological findings on any reproductive organ or tissue in male or female rats 
and dogs in the juvenile toxicity studies. 
Liver 
As expected from studies in adult rats, treatment of juvenile rats with 90 or 180 mg/kg/day led to 
dose-related increased levels of plasma alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol as well as alanine 
transaminase activity. These changes were reversible within the 4-week recovery period. Compared to 
studies with adult rats the changes were slightly less and liver weights were not increased. No effects 
on liver parameters were noted in juvenile or adult dogs. As discussed in the assessment of the initial 
marketing authorisation application, the effects in the rat livers are regarded as physiological adaptive 
mechanisms. However, the potential for hepatotoxicity is included as an important potential risk in the 
RMP and is monitored using routine pharmacovigilance practices. 
Bone 
Bone mineral content, area and density were investigated at the end of the 6-week dose range-finding 
as well as of the 33-week pivotal study in juvenile dogs with no LCM-related changes observed. 
Exposure margins 
As with adult animals, safety margins obtained in the juvenile toxicity studies were small (rat) or non-
existent (dog). However, first effects observed above the NOAEL were predominantly mild to moderate 
exaggerated pharmacodynamic effects on the CNS and completely reversible within some hours. 
Furthermore, all other treatment-related effects observed in rats were completely reversible within a 
4-week recovery period. In particular, based on the data available so far, there are no functional or 
histopathological findings indicating any age-dependent LCM-related effects or effects specifically on 
developmental parameters with the exception of a potential effect on body weight (gain) at higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/124678/2017  
Page 18/78 
 
 
 
 
 
doses and a slightly delayed overall development secondary to this in rats. Therefore, the safety 
margins are considered acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical toxicology data presented by the MAH were considered adequate to support 
the use of LCM as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for the treatment of POS with or without 
secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. The 
data from the new non-clinical juvenile toxicity studies have not identified any new or unique risks with 
regard to the safety of LCM in a juvenile population. Relevant findings were summarized in the SmPC. 
With regards to the ERA, no significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of LCM is 
expected. LCM is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
The MAH confirmed that the clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The clinical studies conducted in paediatric subjects that are included in this submission (see Table 4) 
used the syrup (10mg/mL; formerly also 15mg/mL) and tablet (50mg and 100mg) formulations. In 
studies where both formulations were available, the investigator, subject, and/or subject caregiver 
determined which formulation was appropriate to use, depending on the dose to be delivered and the 
acceptability of the formulation to the subject.

c Study not part of the PIP due to planned efficacy extrapolation in this age group. SP0969 was conducted upon 
request of the US FDA . 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of LCM has been studied in healthy adult subjects, adult subjects with epilepsy, adult subjects 
with neuropathic pain, and adult subjects with renal and/or hepatic impairment. These data showed 
that LCM is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. All oral (tablets and 
syrup) and i.v. formulations have been demonstrated to be bioequivalent and dose proportional. The 
results of a food interaction study in adults in which LCM was given as tablet after a high-fat breakfast 
or in a fasting state showed that food has no influence on the PK of LCM. LCM and its metabolites are 
primarily eliminated by renal excretion. 
In addition to referencing the established PK profile of LCM in adult subjects, support for the present 
extension of indication to paediatric epilepsy patients with POS down to 4 years of age was provided by 
PK data from two completed paediatric studies (SP847 and SP1047), which in turn were used to 
Assessment report

perform PK modeling and simulation with a view to inform paediatric dosing recommendations. A brief 
summary of the two studies and the PK assessment performed is provided below.  
SP847 was a multicentre, open-label, dose-titration study investigating LCM oral solution (syrup) 
(2mg/kg/day to up to 12mg/kg/day) as adjunctive therapy in paediatric subjects aged 1 month to 
17 years with uncontrolled POS. The study was conducted in the United States, Belgium, and Mexico. 
The objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of LCM when added to a 
stable dose regimen of 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs as well as to obtain preliminary efficacy data on 
seizure frequency. Maximum duration of treatment was up to approximately 13 weeks. Plasma 
concentrations of LCM and its major metabolite SPM 12809 were determined for characterization of 
steady-state PK of LCM and SPM 12809 using population PK methods. 
Five cohorts of subjects were enrolled. Cohort 1 enrolled subjects aged ≥5 to ≤11 years (N=7) and 
was designed to determine the planned dose range for the study. Cohorts 2 to 5 enrolled subjects 
aged ≥1 month to ≤17 years (Cohort 2: ≥12 to ≤17 years [N=9]; Cohort 3: ≥2 to <5 years [N=8]; 
Cohort 4: ≥5 to <12 years [N=11]; Cohort 5: ≥1 month to <2 years [N=12]). 
Dose regimens in SP847 were cohort dependent. During the Treatment Period, doses were titrated up 
in increments of LCM 2mg/kg/day at weekly intervals (5 to 7 days) to the maximum recommended 
dose or the maximum dose each subject was able to tolerate for at least 3 days (LCM steady-state). 
Subjects in Cohort 1 were to receive a maximum dose of LCM 8mg/kg/day. On the second day of the 
2-day stay during Visit 3 (Day 7) and Visit 5 (Day 28), blood samples for PK analysis were collected 
within a 12-hour dosing interval after the subject had been on LCM bid for at least 3 days (Visit 3=LCM 
1mg/kg bid [LCM 2mg/kg/day]; Visit 5=LCM 4mg/kg bid [LCM 8mg/kg/day]). Serial PK sampling was 
performed. Sampling time windows for collection of serial blood samples (via venous puncture or 
indwelling venous catheter) from subjects in Cohort 1 were -1 to 0 hours (pre-dose), 18 to 42 minutes 
(post-dose), 48 minutes to 1 hour 12 minutes (post-dose), 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours 30 minutes 
(post-dose), 3 hours 30 minutes to 4 hours 30 minutes (post-dose), 6 to 9 hours (post-dose), and 11 
to 12 hours (post-dose). 
When Cohort 1 completed the Treatment Period, PK parameters were calculated using non-
compartmental methods, based on the blood samples collected during the 2 separate overnight stays. 
Based on evaluation of these PK parameters (alone and compared with adult PK parameters) in 
combination with the safety results and clinical interpretation of the tolerability of LCM, the maximum 
recommended dose for subsequent cohorts (Cohorts 2 to 5) was determined (not to exceed LCM 
12mg/kg/day [or LCM 600mg/day based on body weight, whichever was lower]), which approximated 
the same exposure in adults receiving LCM 400mg/day. After at least 3 days on the maximum 
recommended dose or the maximum tolerated dose (for subjects in Cohorts 2 to 5 only), blood 
samples were collected for PK analysis. 
SP1047 was an open-label, multicentre study evaluating the PK of LCM in paediatric subjects (aged 1 
month to 17 years) prescribed commercially available VIMPAT for epilepsy (tablet or oral solution). 
SP1047 was conducted in the United States. SP1047 was designed to augment the PK data obtained 
from SP847, by collecting sparse samples from paediatric subjects with epilepsy. Subjects must have 
been on a stable LCM dose and dose regimen as prescribed by a physician for at least 7 days prior to 
study entry with no missed doses within 3 days prior to PK sampling on Day 1. The Treatment and 
Evaluation Period consisted of a 1-day visit during which subjects took their usual morning dose of LCM 
at the dose currently prescribed by the individual subject’s physician. Sparse blood samples for PK 
analysis were obtained at 3 scheduled time points: 0 to 1 hour pre-dose, 12 minutes to 1 hour post-
dose, and 1 to 2 hours post-dose. A total of 32 subjects were enrolled in the study in the following age

groups: 10 subjects in the ≥1 month to <4 years age group, 13 subjects in the ≥4 to <12 years age 
group, and 9 subjects in the ≥12 to ≤17 years age group. 
Validation reports for all bioanalytical methods used in studies SP847 and SP1047 have been provided 
and were considered satisfactory. 
The PK of LCM in paediatric subjects was investigated through population modelling and simulation 
studies outlined in the table below.

Chinese patients with uncontrolled POS and from two EU/US studies, SP754 and SP755, in adult 
patients with POS using non-linear mixed-effects modeling was presented to support the simulations 
used to establish paediatric dosing recommendations in the add-on setting. Furthermore, dose

recommendations for monotherapy were supported by population modelling in adult subjects with 
epilepsy during monotherapy treatment with LCM (clinical trial SP0993). 
2.4.2.1.  Physiology based PK (PBPK) simulation 
The initial modeling was a PBPK analysis (CL0096) conducted to validate an adult PBPK model and 
scale it to paediatric subjects. This paediatric PBPK model was then used to support the choice of oral 
dose of LCM in children aged 0-18 years for the first study in paediatric subjects, SP847. 
In the adult model, which was the starting point for the simulations, excretion was assumed not to 
have any active components. There is some contribution of metabolism to clearance, which is 
supported by in vitro data (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19) and an observation of reduced exposure in 
combination with enzyme inducers.  
Two comparisons with clinical studies (SP658 and SP640) were performed as verification of the model, 
using a single dose, 30 minutes i.v. infusion of 200 mg as well as multiple oral administrations of 200 
mg LCM. Exposure appeared to be somewhat under predicted, which was mostly obvious for the single 
dose comparison and minimal in the multidose comparison.  
Age-dependent changes of anatomical and physiological parameters such as body weights, organ 
weights, blood flows etc. were considered for the paediatric PBPK simulations. An area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve at steady-state over a 12-hour dosing interval (AUC12h or AUCtau) of 
100μg·h/mL was set as the target AUC based on the results of study SP640, which is equivalent to an 
average steady-state plasma concentration (Css) of 8.3μg/mL. Based on the simulated PK parameters, 
an initial dose of LCM 3 mg/kg twice daily for the first clinical study in paediatric subjects was 
predicted to ensure a similar exposure to adults receiving LCM 200 mg twice daily. The time to steady 
state was increased in the youngest children having a reduced half-life. 
2.4.2.2.  Population PK analysis of oral LCM in the paediatric population 
Upon completion of studies SP847 and SP1047, a population PK model for LCM in paediatric subjects 
with epilepsy was developed using non-linear mixed-effects modelling (CL0177). Initially, combined 
adult and paediatric data was used to determine reference ranges for steady state concentrations from 
a previously developed model. Thereafter only the final paediatric data obtained from studies SP0847 
and SP1047 were used to develop a population PK model for LCM in a paediatric population aged from 
1 month to <18 years.  
The objectives of analysis were (i) to evaluate the influence of covariates (demographics and 
concomitant AEDs) on LCM PK parameters in children, and (ii) to support paediatric dosing 
adaptations. Diagnostic plots, bootstrap analysis, and visual predictive checks (VPC) were used for 
model evaluation. 
LCM plasma concentration-time data (n=402) were available from 72 sparsely sampled (3 samples per 
subject from SP1047 and SP0847) and 7 serially sampled (7 samples per subject from SP0847) 
paediatric subjects. Of these, study SP847 contributed 312 concentrations from 47 subjects and study 
SP1047 90 observations from 32 patients. Subject numbers were fairly balanced in the <2 years, 2 to 
<6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years age groups of 14, 22, 25, and 18 subjects, 
respectively. The lowest age in the paediatric population was 6 months. A summary of the continuous 
and categorical covariates available for testing in the analysis is provided in the following two tables.

Table 6 – Summary of paediatric continuous covariates in studies SP847 and SP1047  
Table 7 – Race, sex, and age distribution in studies SP847 and SP1047 
Amongst the patients in the studies, 5 (6.3%), 4 (5.1%), and 5 (6.3%) received concomitant 
carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital, respectively (i.e. a total of 14 [17.7%] patients received 
enzyme inducing AEDs [IND]). In addition, 13 patients (16.5%) took valproate in addition to LCM. 
A one-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination was selected for the final model 
in paediatric patients. Clearance (CL) was modelled using allometric scaling on body weight including a 
freely estimated allometric exponent, while volume of distribution used a fixed theoretical allometric 
exponent. Residual error was modelled using an additive and proportional error term. Covariate 
analysis indicated an influence of co-administration of the hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs on CL. No 
significant effects on CL could be attributed to race, sex, age, co-administration of valproate, or body 
surface area-normalized glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). With allometric scaling by body weight, CL in 
the paediatric population was similar to that observed in the adult population with epilepsy. 
The parameter estimates in the final PK model are presented in the table below. The typical CL/F was 
0.79mL/min/kg at the mean population body weight of 28.9kg in absence of inducer AEDs, and ranged

from 1.13mL/min/kg for a body weight of 10kg to 0.59mL/min/kg for a body weight of 70kg. Terminal 
elimination half-life in the absence of other effects was calculated to be 7.4 hours, 10.7 hours, 12.7 
hours, and 14.2 hours at body weights of 10, 30, 50, and 70kg, respectively.

The VPCs indicated that the final model was capable of simulating concentration time-profiles 
corresponding with the original data. VPC graphs split by age group showed dose-normalized 
concentrations increasing with age, suggesting that the dosing strategy used in the trials insufficiently 
corrected for PK changes related to age or weight and that the youngest children had been under-
dosed. The model also confirmed this finding by the estimation of higher clearance for lower body 
weights. 
Simulations to establish dosing recommendations for adjunctive therapy 
Different dosing strategies and potentially suitable dosing adaptations in paediatric subjects with 
epilepsy were investigated through simulations. The adult target exposure range was initially based on 
the predicted Css levels for healthy adults (study SP640). This was later replaced by the population 
estimates from a PK model in adult subjects with epilepsy (based on the phase 3 adjunctive trials 
SP754 and SP755) using the median and 90% of the predicted Css levels in adult subjects with 
epilepsy receiving add-on treatment with 400 mg/day LCM.  
The CL/F estimate in paediatric subjects with epilepsy based on the final paediatric model (2.37 L/h, 
see Table 8) was similar to the one determined in the adult epilepsy model with inducer AED co-

administration (CL/F for a typical 70kg adult = 2.57 L/h) but higher than without inducer AED co-
administration (typical [70 kg] CL/F = 1.92 L/h). The weighted population average CL for a typical 70 
kg adult was CL/F= 2.25 L/h. The corresponding Css values in this study were about 6.49 mg/L for 
adults with epilepsy taking inducer AEDs, about 8.68 mg/L in the absence of inducer AEDs, and about 
7.21 mg/L (5th – 95th percentiles: 4.51 to 11.7 mg/L) for an adult population with and without 
concomitant AEDs. 
In order to simulate C ss in paediatric epilepsy patients, demographic data from cohorts 1999-2004 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (Nhanes) DXA database were used (12006 
paediatric subjects). Inducer co-administration status was sampled from the observed carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital, and phenytoin co-administration fractions in the paediatric subjects. In order to provide 
a reference plasma concentration range, adult demographic data from the same Nhanes database were 
used to simulate Css in adults after receiving LCM 400 mg/day. 
The figure below shows the simulated C ss for four different investigated regimens by weight.

Simulations to establish dosing recommendations for monotherapy 
For the purpose of deriving dose recommendations for LCM monotherapy, the paediatric population PK 
model was adapted according to the inducer AED effect on CL.  
As for the adjunctive setting, in order to simulate Css in paediatric subjects, demographic data from 
cohorts the Nhanes DXA database were used. For the adult a reference range, all adults from the 
Nhanes DXA database were used to simulate Css values for lacosamide 600 mg/day.  
Given that median LCM exposure of adult patients in adjunctive and monotherapy settings have been 
shown to be similar, the population estimates from the previous analysis in adult subjects with 
epilepsy were used to derive 90% of the predicted Css levels for all adult subjects with epilepsy

receiving lacosamide 600 mg/day, without inducing AED coadministration. Only the Western population 
from studies SP754 and SP755 was used. Simulations were performed with the final adult model. 
Simulated Css levels are shown in Figure 2 for the following 3 dose regimens by weight:  
•  12 mg/kg/day for paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg, and 600 mg/day for those 
weighing 50 kg or more. 
•  12 mg/kg/day for paediatric patients <30 kg, 10 mg/kg/day for those 30 to <50 kg and 600 
mg/day for those ≥ 50 kg. 
•  12 mg/kg/day for paediatric patients <40 kg, 10 mg/kg/day for those 40 to <50 kg and 600 
mg/day for those ≥ 50 kg.

2.4.2.3.  Population PK analysis for i.v. and oral LCM in paediatric patients 
In addition to the oral population PK model, a PK analysis (CL0266) was conducted using NONMEM in 
order to determine the population PK parameters of LCM in healthy adult subjects and paediatric 
subjects with epilepsy after i.v. and per os dosing as infusion and tablet/solution, respectively. LCM 
plasma concentration-time data (n=2137) were included from 43 serially sampled healthy adult 
subjects (18 samples per subject) from SP645 and SP658 as well as 79 paediatric subjects (<2 years: 
n=9, 2-<6 years: n=26, 6-<12 years: n=23, 12-<18 years: n=21) with epilepsy from SP847 and 
SP1047 including 72 sparsely sampled (3 samples per subject/period; SP1047 and SP0847) and 7 
serially sampled (7 samples per subject/period; SP0847) patients. In the healthy adult subject 
population, LCM was administered in cross over as i.v. infusions and oral administrations.  
The combined adult and paediatric population PK model was a two-compartment linear disposition 
model with zero order and first order absorption after i.v. and oral administration, respectively. 
Clearance was modelled using allometric scaling on weight using a fixed theoretical allometric 
exponent (0.75), while central volume of distribution (Vc) used a freely estimated allometric exponent. 
Residual error was modelled using separate proportional error terms for the adult and paediatric 
population, respectively. 
No formal covariate analysis was conducted. The effects of individual co-administered AEDs 
(carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin) on LCM CL/F were included a priori. An increased CL in 
paediatric subjects with epilepsy was observed compared to healthy adult subjects due to AED co-
administration. Model diagnostics demonstrated adequate goodness of fit, and visual predictive checks 
demonstrated that the model was capable of simulating the original data. 
Simulations to establish dosing recommendations for i.v. infusion 
A paediatric dataset with 100 subjects per body weight category ranging from 5-75kg (in steps of 5kg) 
and with and without AED co-administration of carbamazepine, phenytoin, or phenobarbital/primidone 
was created and different i.v. infusion and oral dosing regimens were simulated for paediatric subjects 
with epilepsy. Simulations of twice-daily i.v. and oral administrations were based on LCM doses of 12 
mg/kg/day (for subjects weighing <30kg), 8 mg/kg/day (for subjects weighing 30 to <50kg), and 
400mg/day (for subjects weighing ≥50kg). Infusions were simulated to be 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes.  
Steady state maximum plasma concentration (Cmax, ss) and area under the plasma concentration-time 
curve within a dosing interval (AUCτ) values after bid i.v. infusions in paediatric subjects with epilepsy 
were predicted to increase with increasing weight up to the maximum weight in that dosing group (see 
Figures below).

Figure 3 – Simulation of median LCM Cmax across body weight on the 4th day of i.v. and oral 
administrations without AED co-administration 
Figure 4 - Simulation of median LCM AUCτ across body weight after i.v. and oral 
administrations without AED co-administration 
Median steady state Cmax at the end of a 15-min i.v. infusion were predicted to be 9-21% higher 
compared to median Cmax values after oral administration across the weight range of 5-75kg; this 
decreased to 2-11% after a 60-min i.v. infusion compared to oral administration. However, AUCτ were 
fairly similar between oral administration and i.v. infusion and independent of infusion duration.  
Co-administration of AEDs resulted in increases of CL of 50.5% (32.6%/70.8%), 159.3% 
(132.3%/189.3%), and 56.1% (17.3%/107.7%), for carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin, 
respectively. Therefore, plasma concentrations and steady state PK parameters were lower than 
without AED co-administration. 
2.4.2.4.  PK/PD modelling analysis in adults 
Daily seizure counts data were obtained from three phase-2/3 clinical trials (SP667, SP754 and SP755) 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of LCM as adjunctive treatment in adult patients with refractory

epilepsy suffering from POS. Individual plasma exposures were obtained using a previously developed 
population PK model. Based on these data an exposure-response model was developed and later 
extended to paediatric data of 28 children aged 3 to 17 years from study SP847 to compare the 
model-predicted distribution of 50% responder rate in paediatric subjects with the observed value in 
SP847. Individual daily seizure frequencies were fitted to various models adapted to count data and 
various covariates including demographic parameters and AEDs were assessed for their potential 
influence on the exposure-response curve. 
The adult model providing the best fit was a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution with Markov 
element, a sigmoid maximum effect function of LCM trough concentration, and a mixture function was 
used to separate responders and non-responders. Adjunctive LCM treatment demonstrates an 
exposure-response relationship in approximately 76% of patients with refractory POS. Seizure 
frequency reduction from baseline was more pronounced in patients not receiving concomitant 
traditional sodium channel blockers. 
For the extension to paediatrics, simulations were undertaken to evaluate the ability of the adult model 
to predict the paediatric data. One thousand study replicates were simulated with the same structure 
and patient covariates as the observed data of SP847. After an Empirical Bayesian Feedback 
estimation, the exposure-response model developed in adults seemed to satisfactorily describe the 
paediatric data. The adult exposure-response model was consistent with preliminary the data obtained 
in 28 children from study SP847. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH’s approach to apply PK and PK/PD modeling and simulation with a view to inform paediatric 
dosing recommendations was considered acceptable. Data from two open-label paediatric studies 
(SP847 and SP1047) with LCM tablets and syrup in patients aged 1 month to 17 years with epilepsy 
were used to inform the model.  
The resulting population PK model for children has been shown to describe the data well, however 
since the model used simulations to guide dosing recommendations, the demands for predictive 
performance was high. In this context, the CHMP noted that the model has been developed on PK data 
from children 1 month and older and that no maturation function was used for the very young children. 
In order to investigate the influence of data from children <2 years, the MAH provided population PK 
parameters estimated with (n=79) and without (n=65) children <2 years of age. Similar parameter 
estimates were obtained with both datasets. A slight difference was noted in the inducer effect 
however this was not considered to influence the conclusions drawn from the simulations. Also, a 
maturation function was applied to the full paediatric dataset but was not supported by data. However, 
for future use of the population PK model in infants, the MAH is encouraged to further investigate age 
dependence as it is influential on both renal and metabolic processes. 
Based on the parameters derived from the final model, the PK of LCM in children appeared to be very 
similar to the adult PK. As was expected, co-administration of hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs led to an 
increase of LCM CL at the extent previously observed in adults. An important difference was the size-
dependent clearance (CL) which warranted for dose adaptations based on the relationship between 
clearance and weight. In fact, the model suggested that the youngest children in the clinical trials 
SP847 and SP1047 had been under-dosed. However, given that only patients aged 4 years and older 
were included in the present application, the issue was not further pursued. 
Simulations compared the estimated paediatric exposure to adult exposure at the maximum 
recommended dose in the add-on and mono-therapy settings, respectively. Paediatric dose

recommendations derived from these simulations were used to define the maximum dose to be used in 
children and adolescents.  
In line with the above, the reference target exposure range in the initial simulations was defined as the 
median and 90% of the predicted steady state concentration levels for healthy adults receiving 
400 mg/day LCM, without AED co-medication. The MAH subsequently revised the reference target to 
the predicted exposure from two phase 3 trials with in adult epileptic patients receiving 400 mg/day 
LCM adjunctive therapy, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP for the purpose of comparing 
adult and paediatric exposure in the simulations for the purpose of deriving dose recommendations in 
the add-on setting. For monotherapy, data from adult subjects with epilepsy receiving lacosamide 600 
mg/day, without inducing AED coadministration was used. 
Following simulations of several LCM steady state concentrations based on different weight-based 
dosing schemes, the MAH concluded that a three-tier regimen of 12mg/kg/day for subjects weighing 
<30kg, 8mg/kg/day for subjects weighing 30kg to <50kg and 400mg/day for subjects weighing ≥50kg 
in the add-on setting approximated the respective levels observed in adults with POS. However, the 
proposed dose recommendation for adjunctive therapy did not adequately take into account the large 
proportion of patients exceeding the upper limit of the reference target exposure in patients weighing 
20-30 kg, and a steep drop in Css is apparent in the simulations at the 30 kg cut-off. A four weight 
band dosing regimen as presented amongst the simulated dosing scenarios, i.e. 12 mg/kg/day for <20 
kg, 10 mg/kg/day for 20-<30 kg, 8 mg/kg/day for 30-<50 kg, 400 mg/day for ≥50 kg, was 
considered more appropriate as it provided for more balanced exposure estimates including for 
patients weighing 20-30 kg. 
With regards to the dosing recommendation for monotherapy, both the paediatric population PK model 
and adult model were adapted to a monotherapy situation to allow for an adequate comparison. The 
MAH originally proposed to pursue a 2-tier dose regimen (12 mg/kg/day for patients weighing <50 kg 
and 600 mg/day for patients weighing ≥50 kg). Median exposure with the 2-tier regimen appeared 
generally being lower in paediatric patients compared to adults with some paediatric patients in the 30 
to <50 kg weight band likely to have higher variability in exposure, some of which exceeding the adult 
reference range. In order to better match the median exposure in children with adults whilst limiting 
the highest exposures in children below those in adults, a 3-tier regimen of 12 mg/kg/day for 
paediatric patients <40 kg, 10 mg/kg/day for those 40 to <50 kg and 600 mg/day for those ≥50 kg 
was considered to provide a more balanced solution. With regards to the finding that exposure in 
children tends to be generally somewhat lower than in adults (irrespective of the simulated dose 
regimen), it was not considered appropriate to increase the maximum dose beyond 12 mg/kg/day, as 
the safety of such doses has not been studied. 
The approach for deriving a dosing regimen for i.v. infusion in children based on i.v. infusion data in 
adults and per os data in children in a combined paediatric and adult model was considered reasonable 
in light of the high bioavailability of oral LCM of near 100%. The model adequately described the 
plasma concentrations of LCM in both healthy adult subjects and paediatric epilepsy patients. Different 
i.v. and oral doses were simulated including a 15 minute i.v. infusion as worst case scenario in terms 
of possible peak exposure. Overall, the model-based PK predictions suggested that there was no need 
to adapt the oral dose recommendations for i.v. infusions of 15 to 60 minutes.  
For initiation of LCM treatment, the proposed starting dose was LCM 2 mg/kg/day to be increased to 
an initial therapeutic dose of 4 mg/kg/day after 1 week for both add-on and monotherapy, and to be 
further increased by weekly increments of 2 mg/kg/day depending on response and tolerability up to 
the maximum recommended dose (see above). The starting dose approximated a dose of LCM 100 
mg/day (depending on age and body weight), which is the starting dose and weekly dose incremental

increase for add-on treatment in adults. The starting dose of LCM 2mg/kg/day has also been evaluated 
in completed (SP847) and ongoing paediatric studies (SP848, SP0969) in subjects with POS down to 1 
month of age. The approach was supported by the CHMP. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed to apply the current dose recommendations for adults and adolescents 
aged 16 years and older to adolescents weighing 50 kg or more. The proposal was based on the 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts (2000) for weight-for-age percentiles (2 years 
to 20 years of age), according to which the ages at which a child reaches the 50th percentile at a 
weight of 50kg are 13.82 years for boys and 14.21 years for girls. Therefore, average paediatric 
patients weighing 50kg are approximately 2 years younger than the previous lower age limit of 16 
years. Given that in the PK modeling, LCM exposure in paediatric subjects weighing 50kg or more is 
predicted to be the same as exposure observed in adults, the approach as considered acceptable. This 
included the use of a loading dose in children and adolescents weighing 50 kg or more, whereas, in 
line with the MAH’s application, use of a loading dose was not recommended in paediatric patients 
weighing less than 50 kg. 
Finally, with regards to the PK/PD modelling, the analysis was considered to have been adequately 
performed and established a valuable exposure-response relationship for daily seizures in adults. The 
analysis was viewed as supportive evidence to the full extrapolation of clinical efficacy data from adults 
to children. The CHMP furthermore noted the paediatric PBPK model, which overall, except for few 
outliers, showed an acceptable agreement between the sparse experimental data and the simulated 
data. However, the confidence in the predictive performance of the paediatric PBPK model was limited 
by the small number of adolescents (approximately 30 subjects) and the evidence that 16-17 years old 
adolescents are physiologically closer to adults than to children. However, given that the PBPK 
predictions were superseded by population PK findings derived from real observed data in paediatric 
patients with epilepsy, this was not considered of immediate relevance for the purpose of the present 
application. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Population PK modelling and simulation were considered sufficiently robust to reliably predict paediatric 
PK parameters and exposure levels in children. The simulations support a weight-adjusted four-tier 
(add-on therapy) and three-tier (monotherapy) paediatric dosing regimen. Overall, the available 
clinical pharmacology data were considered adequate to support the present application for an 
extension of the indication for Vimpat to monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of POS 
with or without secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with 
epilepsy.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of LCM in the treatment of adult and adolescent (16-18 years) epilepsy patients with POS 
has previously been established both as adjunctive therapy and as monotherapy. Adjunctive treatment 
with LCM for POS has been investigated in 3 randomized controlled trials (SP667, SP754 and SP755), 
whereas LCM monotherapy was evaluated in a single head-to-head non-inferiority study (SP0993). 
In line with the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic 
disorders (CHMP/EWP/566/98 Rev.2/Corr), in refractory focal epilepsies, the results of efficacy trials 
performed in adults could to some extent be extrapolated to children older than 4 years provided the 
dose is established. The MAH was of the view that extrapolation of efficacy was possible for both newly

diagnosed and refractory POS. No clinical study data supporting efficacy of LCM in children aged 4 to 
<16 years have been provided for the purpose of this application.  
The CHMP considered that extrapolation from adult data to children older than 4 years old for both 
add-on and mono-therapy of POS with or without secondary generalization was in principle acceptable. 
Supportive non-clinical data, clinical pharmacology data, clinical safety data, literature and post 
marketing data are summarized and assessed in the respective sections. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of LCM has previously been investigated in adult and adolescent (16-18 years) 
epilepsy patients with POS. Based on data with LCM as adjunctive therapy, the most common adverse 
reactions in adults were related to the CNS and gastrointestinal system and included dizziness, 
headache, nausea and diplopia. Some of these adverse reactions were dose-related and both incidence 
and severity usually decreased over time. Based on data from monotherapy studies in adult patients 
with POS, the most frequently reported adverse reactions observed with LCM were headache and 
dizziness. Dizziness was the most common reason for LCM treatment discontinuation. 
The use of LCM is furthermore associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval and adverse 
reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) 
have been observed at an uncommon frequency. Furthermore, abnormalities in liver function tests 
have been observed in the adjuvant setting.  
For the purpose of the present application, the safety of LCM in the paediatric population was primarily 
assessed based on pooled data from studies SP847, SP848, and EP0034 in epilepsy patients aged 
1 month to <17 years with POS receiving adjuvant treatment with LCM as of the clinical cut-off date of 
30 Nov 2015. Furthermore, post-marketing safety data of paediatric use of commercially available LCM 
were provided. 
A brief summary of the 3 studies is provided below. 
SP847: Please see section 2.4.2. for a summary of the study design/methods. Subjects who 
participated in SP847 may have been able to enrol in the long-term, open-label study (SP848).  
SP848: This study is a Phase 2, open-label trial to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and PK of 
adjunctive LCM in paediatric subjects with epilepsy aged 1 month to ≤17 years. In addition, the study 
is designed to obtain preliminary efficacy data on seizure frequency during long-term exposure. SP848 
was ongoing at the time of this report. 
Subjects form studies SP847 and SP0966 were able to enrol into SP848 after study completion. In 
addition, SP848 allows for up to approximately 100 subjects with POS (≥4 years to ≤17 years of age) 
to enrol directly into the study. An additional cohort of 46 Japanese subjects aged ≥4 years to ≤17 
years of age with POS has also directly enrolled into SP848 in Japan. Subjects who enter SP848 from 
SP847 or SP0966 began on the LCM dose that they were receiving at the end of the previous paediatric 
study. Subjects who enrolled directly into SP848 without previous participation in a LCM clinical study 
underwent screening. Eligible subjects initiate adjunctive LCM treatment at a dose of 2mg/kg/day (oral 
solution) or 100 mg/day (tablets), and the LCM dose was titrated in increments of 2mg/kg/day (oral 
solution) or 100 mg/day (tablets) each week to a level to optimize tolerability and seizure control (not 
to exceed 12 mg/kg/day [or 600 mg/day based on body weight, whichever is lower]).

EP0034: This study was ongoing at the time of this report; it is an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, open-
label, extension study to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of adjunctive LCM in paediatric 
subjects with epilepsy aged 1 month to ≤17 years with POS. The study enrolled subjects who 
completed SP0969 or SP0967. After completion of a Transition Period in the primary study, subjects 
will have been transitioned to a dose of oral solution or tablets of LCM according to their weight. 
Subjects will receive LCM 10 mg/kg/day (oral solution) for subjects weighing <30 kg, LCM 
6 mg/kg/day (oral solution) for subjects weighing ≥30 kg to <50 kg, and LCM 300 mg/day (tablets) 
for subjects weighing ≥50 kg during at least their first week in the Treatment Period of EP0034. After 1 
week in EP0034, the investigator may adjust the LCM dose based on clinical judgment within a range 
of 2 mg/kg/day to 12 mg/kg/day for the oral solution and 100 mg/day to 600 mg/day for the tablets. 
LCM maximum doses were 600 mg/day or 12 mg/kg/day, whichever was lower based on body weight.  
In addition, during the course of this procedure, the MAH provided interim long-term data from studies 
SP848 and EP0034 on cognition using BRIEF/BRIEF-P and Achenbach questionnaires. Furthermore, the 
MAH submitted interim data from study SP0969, a Phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LCM as adjunctive 
therapy in subjects with epilepsy ≥4 years to <17 years of age with uncontrolled POS. The study was 
planned to support the filing of the paediatric extension of indication outside Europe. 
Safety data were presented as treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), which were defined as those events 
which started on or after the date of first dose of LCM, or whose severity worsened on or after the date 
of first dose of LCM through 30 days following the last dose of LCM or up to the clinical cut-off date. 
Drug-related TEAEs were those with a relationship of 'related', 'possibly related', or those with missing 
responses, as determined by the investigator. Not drug-related TEAEs were those with a relationship of 
'unlikely related' or 'not related'. If the relationship was missing, the AE was assumed to be related to 
study medication.  
TEAEs were presented overall for all subjects included in the safety assessment, as well as by age 
groups (<4 years, 4 years to <12 years, 12 years to <16 years, total 4 to <16 years, and ≥16 years) 
and weight bands (<30kg, 30 to <50kg, total <50kg, and ≥50kg). In addition to age and weight, 
TEAEs were summarized according to a number of variables including relationship, seriousness, modal 
dose, geographical region, racial group, gender, and exposure period.  
Patient exposure 
A safety pool (Pool SPX-1) including all paediatric subjects with POS who received at least 1 dose of 
LCM in the combined SP847 and SP848 studies or in EP0034 was used as the primary data set for the 
safety analysis. Pool SPX-1 included clinical safety data as of the clinical cutoff date of 30 Nov 2015. 
Subjects in EP0034 who participated in SP0967 were excluded due to limited available data as of the 
clinical cut-off date (2 subjects enrolled) and because these subjects were outside of the target age 
group for this submission.

Table 9 – Summary of Pool SPX-1 
As of the clinical cutoff date, a total of 303 subjects have been exposed to at least 1 dose of LCM for a 
total exposure of 264.5 subject-years (see Table 10). A total of 188 subjects (62.0%) had been 
exposed to LCM for at least 6 months for a total exposure of 237.5 subject-years, 120 subjects 
(39.6%) had been exposed to LCM for at least 12 months for a total exposure of 194.1 subject-years, 
77 subjects (25.4%) had been exposed to LCM for at least 18 months for a total exposure of 146.1 
subject-years, and 57 subjects (18.8%) had been exposed to LCM for at least 24 months for a total 
exposure of 113.9 subject-years. Overall, 257 subjects were 4 to <16 years of age at the time of 
enrollment in the first study. Of these, 101 patients were exposed to treatment with LCM for more 
than 12 months defined as 28 days) and 97 patients aged 4 to <16 years were treated for ≥ 1 
calendar year.  
Of the 257 subjects who were 4 to <16 years of age at the time of enrollment in the first study, 107 
subjects, 86 subjects, and 64 subjects started the study in the <30kg, 30kg to <50kg, and ≥50kg 
weight bands, respectively (Table 11). The 30 to <50 kg weight band had higher percentages of 
subjects exposed to LCM for >6, >12, >18, and >24 months (decreasing from 70.9% to 23.3%) 
compared with either the ≥50 kg weight band (decreasing from 62.5% to 10.9%) or the < 30kg 
weight band (decreasing from 56.1% to 16.8%). This difference was most notable for >12 months of 
LCM exposure and included 55.8% of subjects in the 30 to <50 kg weight band compared with 29.9% 
and 32.8% of subjects in the <30 kg and ≥50 kg weight bands, respectively.

Table 10 - Exposure to LCM by age group (Pool SPX-1) 
Table 11 - Exposure to LCM by weight band for subjects 4 to <16 years of age (Pool SPX-1) 
Among the subjects aged 4 to <16 years, the highest proportion of subjects had LCM modal daily 
doses of 8 mg/kg/day (56 subjects [21.8%]), followed by 6 mg/kg/day (53 subjects [20.6%]) and 
10 mg/kg/day (52 subjects [20.2%]). A higher percentage of subjects in the 4 to <12 years age group 
had a LCM modal daily dose of 10 mg/kg/day (24.4%) or ≥12mg/kg/day (14.3%), compared with the 
12 to <16 years age group (12.4% and 6.7%, respectively).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/124678/2017

When analyzed by weight band, the highest proportion of subjects with a modal daily dose of 
≥12 mg/kg/day occurred in the <30 kg weight band (21.5%, 23/107 patients), and this proportion 
decreased to 8.1% (7/86 patients) in the 30 to <50 kg weight band and to 0% for the ≥50 kg weight 
band. Five (5) patients in the ≥ 50kg weight band (7.8%) received 10 mg/kg/day dose, which 
corresponds to a dose above highest recommended dose for adjunct therapy in adults. The most 
common modal daily dose for the ≥50 kg weight band was 4mg/kg/day (46.9%, 30/64 patients). In 
general, the most common modal daily dose categories decreased with increasing weight category. 
As of the clinical cutoff date, the mean duration of exposure was 318.8 days for all subjects in Pool 
SPX-1. The mean duration of exposure was longer in the <4 years age group (564.5 days) and shorter 
in the ≥16 years age group (239.1 days), compared with the 4 to <12 years and 12 to <16 years age 
groups (316.2 days and 309.9 days, respectively). The mean modal daily dose was highest in the 
youngest age group of <4 year olds (9.47mg/kg/day), followed by the 4 to <12 years age group 
(8.37mg/kg/day), the 12 to <16 years age group (6.75mg/kg/day), and the ≥16 years age group 
(6.39mg/kg/day). For subjects (116) with at least 1 calendar year of LCM exposure, the mean duration 
of exposure was 598.9 days. The mean duration of exposure was longer in the <4 years age group 
(698.0 days) and 4 to <12 years age group (601.3 days) compared with the 12 to <16 years and ≥16 
years age groups (566.2 days and 566.3 days, respectively). 
By weight band, the mean duration of exposure for subjects aged 4 to <16 years of age was longest in 
the 30 to <50kg weight band (382.8 days), followed by the <30kg and ≥50kg weight bands (281.2 
days and 276.6 days, respectively). For subjects aged 4 to <16 years old, the overall mean modal 
daily dose (i.e., the daily LCM dose the subject received for the longest duration during the Treatment 
Period) was 7.81mg/kg/day. The mean maximum daily doses and mean modal daily doses were 
similar for the <30kg (10.15 mg/kg/day and 8.70 mg/kg/day, respectively) and 30 to <50kg 
(9.49 mg/kg/day and 8.14 mg/kg/day, respectively) weight bands and were higher than those 
observed in the ≥50 kg weight band (6.62 mg/kg/day and 5.87 mg/kg/day, respectively).  
Subject Disposition  
The majority of patients in all age groups were still treated with LCM at the data cutoff (≥16 years 
[90.3%], 12 to <16 years [67.4%] and 4 to <12 years [58.3%]). The most common reason for 
discontinuation was lack of efficacy (28 subjects, 9.2%), followed by AE (17 subjects, 5.6%), 
withdrawn consent (12 subjects, 4.0%), other (4 subjects, 1.3%), lost to follow up (3 subjects, 1.0%), 
and protocol violation (1 subject, 0.3%) for all subjects. Lack of efficacy was cited as a reason for 
discontinuation only within the 4 to <16 age group, with 21 of the 28 subjects being 4 to <12 years of 
age. Younger children discontinued more often due to AEs compared to the older ones: 3 subjects 
(20.0%) <4 years of age, 10 subjects (6.0%) 4 to <12 years of age, 3 subjects (3.4%) 12 to <16 
years of age, and 1 subject (3.2%) ≥16 years of age.  
The percentage of subjects aged 4 to <16 years who have discontinued from the study was slightly 
higher in the <30kg weight band compared with the 30kg to <50kg and ≥50kg weight bands (27.1% 
[29/107] vs 18.6% [16/86] and 23.4% [15/64], respectively). The majority of discontinuations were 
due to lack of efficacy across all weight bands (range: 9.3% to 12.1%). The percentage of subjects 
aged 4 to <16 years who discontinued due to AEs was lowest in <30kg weight band (4 subjects 
[3.7%]) compared with the 30kg to <50kg and ≥50kg weight bands (5 subjects [5.8%] and 4 subjects 
[6.3%], respectively).

There were slightly more males in the 4 to <16 years old group in contrast to younger and older age 
groups. Most patients in the 4 to <12 years old group belong to weight band <30kg (62.5%) and 
patients in the 12 to <16 years old age group belong to weight band >50kg (61.8%). Most patients 
were white in the age group 4 to 16 years old (66.9%). Regarding representation of different racial 
groups, the black group was underrepresented (6.9% of all ages) in the pooled population. 
Across each weight band for the subjects 4 to <16 years of age, the proportion of male and female 
subjects was similar. As expected, mean and median age increased with increasing weight band.  
Baseline disease characteristics and seizure history are summarized in Table 13 and Table 14. Mean 
age at epilepsy diagnosis and duration of the epilepsy was higher in older patients compared to the 
younger ones. The duration of epilepsy was similar in the 12 to <16 years old group and the ≥16 years 
old group. Approximately 30% of patients in all age groups have been treated with 1-3 AEDs before. 
The information regarding previous AED treatment was missing in 20 to 40% of patients in different 
age groups. Most patients in the 4 to<12 years and 12 to <16 years old groups had complex POS 
(78.6% and 82%, respectively). Patients in the <30kg weight band in general had been treated with 
more AEDs, compared to 30 to <50kg weight or the ≥50kg weight group (7+ AEDs – 24.3%, 14.0% 
and 9.4%, respectively).

Prior and concomitant diseases  
Among the subjects who were 4 to <16 years of age, the most commonly reported medical history 
conditions (except epilepsy) included developmental delay and mental retardation (34 subjects, 13.2% 
each), constipation (28 subjects, 10.9%), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (26 subjects, 10.1%), 
cerebral palsy (22 subjects, 8.6%), headache (21 subjects, 8.2%), asthma (19 subjects, 7.4%), and 
seasonal allergy (17 subjects, 6.6%). One subject in the 4 to <12 year age group had a medical 
history of severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (reported term of Dravet syndrome) and should not 
have been directly enrolled in SP848. At the time of the clinical cutoff date, this subject had 1.2 years 
of LCM exposure and is ongoing in SP848. No TEAEs of convulsion, epilepsy, or status epilepticus were 
reported for this subject.  
Among the subjects who were 4 to <16 years of age, the most commonly reported concomitant 
diseases and conditions, defined as ≥5%, included developmental delay and mental retardation (34 
subjects, 13.2% each), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and constipation (26 subjects, 10.1% 
each), cerebral palsy (22 subjects, 8.6%), headache (20 subjects, 7.8%), seasonal allergy (17 
subjects, 6.6%), and asthma (16 subjects, 6.2%).  
Prior and concomitant medication 
Approximately 30% of patients in all age groups have been treated with 1-3 AEDs before enrolling in 
the studies. Information regarding previous anti-epilepsy treatment is missing in 20 to 40% of patients 
in different age groups. Patients in the <30kg weight band in general had been treated with more 
AEDs, compared to 30 to <50kg weight or the ≥50kg weight group (7+ AEDs – 24.3%, 14.0% and 
9.4%, respectively).  
All subjects (303 subjects [100%]) reported use of at least 1 concomitant AED at the start of the 
Treatment Period: 49 subjects (16.2%) were taking 1 concomitant AED, 154 subjects (50.8%) were 
taking 2 concomitant AEDs, and 100 subjects (33.0%) were taking 3 concomitant AEDs. The most 
common concomitant AEDs were levetiracetam (132 subjects [43.6%]), valproate (114 subjects 
[37.6%]), and lamotrigine (89 subjects [29.4%]), which were also the most common among subjects 
aged 4 to <16 years.  
Assessment report

A total of 219 subjects (72.3%) reported use of at least 1 concomitant non-AED medication. The most 
common concomitant non-AED medications (based on Level 1 ATC class) were nervous system drugs 
(131 subjects [43.2%]), respiratory system drugs (119 subjects [39.3%]), alimentary tract and 
metabolism drugs (112 subjects [37.0%]), and anti-invectives for systemic use (103 subjects 
[34.0%]). Within the nervous system drugs, analgesic use was highest in the <4 years age group (9 
subjects [60.0%]) and was similar across the remaining age groups (range of 25.8% to 28.1%). 
Psycholeptics were more commonly used in the younger age groups (3 subjects [20%] in <4 years and 
27 subjects [16.1%] in 4 to <12 years) relative to older age groups (4 subjects [4.5%] in 12 to <16 
years and 2 subjects [6.5%] in ≥16 years age group). Psychoanaleptics were not used in subjects <4 
years of age, but were mainly used in 38 subjects (14.8%) who were 4 to <16 years of age. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
As of the clinical cutoff date, 240 subjects (79.2%) experienced 1835 treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) following treatment with LCM. The incidence of subjects experiencing TEAEs decreased 
with an increase in age group (100%, 82.1%, 73.0%, and 71.0% for the <4 years, 4 to <12 years, 12 
to <16 years, and ≥16 years age groups, respectively). 
Table 15 – Overview TEAE incidence by age group (Pool SPX-1) 
Among the 116 subjects with ≥1 calendar year of LCM exposure, 108 subjects (93.1%) experienced 
1381 TEAEs over the LCM Exposure Period. Of these, thirty-one subjects (26.7%) experienced 
95 treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs). Five subjects (4.3%) experienced 6 TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation, and all 5 subjects were 4 to <16 years of age. Fifteen subjects (12.9%) 
Assessment report

experienced 27 severe TEAEs. Sixty-four subjects (55.2%) experienced 354 TEAEs considered related 
to study medication by the investigator.  
For subjects 4 to <16 years of age, the incidences for TEAEs were 83.2%, 76.7%, and 75.0% in the 
<30kg, 30kg to <50kg, and ≥50kg weight bands, respectively. Similar percentages of subjects were 
observed across weight bands for drug-related TEAEs (range: 42.2% to 47.7%) and TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation (range: 5.8% to 7.8%). The incidence of severe TEAEs was higher for subjects in the 
30kg to <50kg weight band (12.8%) compared with subjects in the <30kg (2.8%) and ≥50kg weight 
band (3.1%). The incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was higher for subjects aged 4 to <16 years 
in the <30kg and 30kg to <50kg weight bands (15.0% and 15.1%, respectively) compared with 
subjects in the ≥50kg weight band (6.3%). The incidence of drug-related SAEs was 2.8% and 4.7% in 
the <30kg and 30 to <50kg weight bands, respectively, and none of the subjects in the ≥50kg weight 
band experienced a drug-related SAE. No deaths occurred in the completed SP847 study or in the 
ongoing SP848 and EP0034 studies as of the clinical cutoff date of 30 Nov 2015; however, a fatal case 
occurred after the clinical cutoff date.  
Common TEAEs  
The most common TEAEs, defined as occurring in ≥5% of all subjects, are summarized in Table 16. 
Overall across all age groups, TEAEs were most common in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Classes (SOCs) of Nervous system disorders (46.9%), Infections 
and infestations (46.2%), Gastrointestinal disorders (33.0%), and General disorders and 
administration site conditions (26.1%). The most common TEAEs overall were nasopharyngitis (55 
subjects [18.2%]), vomiting (53 subjects [17.5%]), dizziness (49 subjects [16.2%]), pyrexia (45 
subjects [14.9%]), somnolence (41 subjects [13.5%]), headache (35 subjects [11.6%]), and upper 
respiratory tract infection (32 subjects [10.6%]).  
Patients in the 4 to <12 years old group had the highest frequency of TEAEs of pyrexia (16.7%), 
irritability (5.4%), nasopharyngitis (22.6%), upper respiratory tract infection (11.3%) and decreased 
appetite (7.1%) across all age groups. In contrast, the highest frequencies of diplopia (9.7%) and 
dizziness (19.4%) were reported in the ≥16 year old group. Vomiting, dizziness, and somnolence were 
also observed with LCM usage in the ≥16 year old population.  
In the updated data set with a data lock at 2 May 2016, convulsions were experienced by 32 subjects 
(9.3%) overall; nine subjects (2.6%) experienced status epilepticus. The incidence of convulsions was 
balanced across the 4 to <12 years, 12 to <16 years, and ≥16 years age groups (10.1%, 8.6%, and 
8.8%, respectively) and lower in the <4 years age group (6.7%). Four of the 32 subjects experiencing 
convulsions during the LCM Exposure Period were outside of the target age group of 4 to <16 years of 
age, leaving 28 subjects within the target age group. Of the 28 subjects with a TEAE of convulsions, in 
19 subjects the LCM dose was unchanged; the event resolved in 18 subjects and was not resolved at 
the time of data cutoff in 1 subject. The incidence of convulsions was 10.6%, 10.0%, and 7.0% across 
the <30kg, 30 to <50kg, and ≥50kg weight bands. For status epilepticus, the incidences in the 
aforementioned weight bands were 2.4%, 3.0%, and 0%. 
Thirteen (46.4%) of the 28 subjects aged 4 to <16 years with a TEAE of convulsion had at least 
1 concurrent TEAE with an onset date on or within ±3 days of the start date of the TEAE of convulsion. 
Nine subjects (32.1%) with a TEAE of convulsion had at least 1 concurrent TEAE known to decrease 
seizure threshold (ie, pyrexia, infections, and severe dehydration) or a gastrointestinal TEAE that could 
have potential negative impact on absorption and subsequent serum levels of LCM and other AEDs. 
Assessment report

The onset of convulsion in the 28 subjects ranged from 24 days to as long as 724 days; in 15 subjects 
(53.5%), the onset date of convulsion was more than 180 days since the start of LCM. In the MAH’s 
view, the long time to the onset of convulsion may reflect the natural course of epilepsy rather than a 
relationship to LCM. 
Table 16 – Overview of common TEAEs (≥5% of all subjects) with onset during the LCM 
Exposure Period  (Pool SPX-1) 
Among cardiac-related terms, 2 subjects (0.7%) experienced bradycardia, and 1 subject (0.3%) 
experienced a bundle branch block. The event of bundle branch block occurred in a male subject who 
was a 7.72-year-old at the start of study participation, and the event was considered not serious, not 
related to study medication by the investigator, mild in intensity, and did not lead to study 
discontinuation. Syncope occurred in 1 subject. An additional event of presyncope was observed in a

different subject who was 15.46 years old at the time of starting study participation. The event of 
presyncope was considered not serious, not related to study medication by the investigator, mild in 
intensity, and did not lead to study discontinuation and overlapped with TEAEs of nausea, decreased 
appetite, dizziness, and fatigue. 
The majority of TEAEs reported during the study occurred during the first 3 months of treatment. A 
total of 211 subjects (69.6%) experienced TEAEs during this time interval, with the highest incidence 
in the <4 years age group (100%) compared with the 4 to <12 years, 12 to <16 years, and ≥16 years 
age groups (73.2%, 59.6%, and 64.5%, respectively). The remaining time intervals (>3 to ≤6 
months, >6 to ≤9 months, >9 to ≤12 months, >12 to ≤15 months, >15 to ≤18 months, >18 to ≤21 
months, >21 to ≤24 months, and >24 months) had a lower incidence of TEAEs in the overall subject 
population (range: 24.6% to 52.5%).  
The most common TEAEs for subjects 4 to <16 years of age varied by weight band: In the <30kg 
weight band, nasopharyngitis (26 subjects [24.3%]) was the most common TEAE, followed by pyrexia 
(24 subjects [22.4%]) and vomiting (22 subjects [20.6%]). Notably, the incidence of pyrexia by 
subjects in this weight band was higher relative to the 30kg to <50kg and ≥50kg weight bands 
(22.4% vs 9.3% and 7.8%, respectively). However, the incidence of TEAEs within the Infections and 
infestations SOC was also higher for the <30 kg weight band relative to the 30kg to <50kg and ≥50kg 
weight bands (55.1% vs 43.0% and 35.9%, respectively). In contrast, the incidence of headache by 
subjects in this weight band was lower relative to the 30kg to <50kg and ≥50kg weight bands (4.7% 
vs 16.3% and 17.2%, respectively). In the 30kg to <50kg weight band, vomiting (19 subjects 
[22.1%]) was the most common TEAE, followed by dizziness (15 subjects [17.4%]) and headache (14 
subjects [16.3%]). In the ≥50kg weight band, dizziness (13 subjects [20.3%]) was the most common 
TEAE, followed by headache (11 subjects [17.2%]) and nasopharyngitis (8 subjects [12.5%]). The 
incidence of dizziness was 20.3% in the ≥50kg weight band and was 14.0% and 17.4% in the <30kg 
and 30kg to <50kg weight bands, respectively. Notably, the incidence of vomiting and somnolence by 
subjects in this weight band was lower relative to the <30kg and 30kg to <50kg weight bands 
(vomiting: 4.7% vs 20.6% and 22.1%, respectively; somnolence: 4.7% vs 15.9% and 12.8%, 
respectively). The incidence of decreased appetite was highest in the <30kg weight band (9.3%) and 
decreased with an increase in weight (5.8% for 30 to <50kg weight band and 3.1% for ≥50kg weight 
band). The incidence of lethargy was also highest in the <30kg weight band (7.5%) and was 3.5% and 
0% in the 30 to <50kg and ≥50kg weight bands, respectively. The incidence of abnormal behavior was 
similar across weight bands (range: 1.2% to 3.1%).  
A total of 133 subjects (43.9%) experienced TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to LCM 
(i.e., drug-related), and the incidence of subjects who experienced drug-related TEAEs was similar 
across age groups (range: 35.5% to 47.0%). Drug-related TEAEs were most common in the SOCs of 
Nervous system disorders (93 subjects [30.7%]), Gastrointestinal disorders (46 subjects [15.2%]), 
Psychiatric disorders (29 subjects [9.6%]), and General disorders and administration site conditions 
(28 subjects [9.2%]) (ISS Table 7.6). Overall, the most common drug-related TEAEs were dizziness 
(38 subjects [12.5%]), somnolence (35 subjects [11.6%]), and vomiting (26 subjects [8.6%]).  
Of the 240 subjects (79.2%) who experienced a TEAE, 120 subjects (39.6%) had a maximum TEAE 
intensity of mild and 102 subjects (33.7%) had a maximum TEAE intensity of moderate. Overall, 
18 subjects (5.9%) experienced a TEAE of severe intensity, and the incidence of severe TEAEs was 
balanced across age groups (range of 5.4% to 6.7%). Severe TEAEs across Pool SPX-1 included status 
epilepticus (5 subjects), convulsion (4 subjects), vomiting (2 subjects), and catheter site infection, 
clavicle fracture, constipation, decreased appetite, dehydration, diarrhea, dizziness, diplopia, epilepsy, 
fatigue, hematemesis, intracranial hemorrhage, mental status changes, nephrolithiasis, neurotoxicity,

pancreatitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, respiratory distress, and urinary tract infection (1 subject each). 
Severe TEAEs that were also SAEs included status epilepticus (5 subjects); convulsions (4 subjects); 
vomiting (2 subjects); and clavicle fracture, constipation, decreased appetite, dehydration, diarrhea, 
diplopia, dizziness, epilepsy, hematemesis, intracranial hemorrhage, mental status changes, 
nephrolithiasis, neurotoxicity, pancreatitis, pneumonia, respiratory distress, and urinary tract infection 
(1 subject each).  
Ten related and severe TEAEs occurred in 6 subjects and included convulsion, epilepsy, vomiting, and 
pancreatitis (1 subject); diarrhea and vomiting (1 subject), status epilepticus (2 subjects), fatigue 
(1 subject), and decreased appetite (1 subject).  
Paediatric growth-, neurodevelopment-, behavior-, and endocrine-related TEAEs  
•  Safety Pool SPX-1 
Fifteen subjects (5.0%) experienced 18 TEAEs of irritability and included 9 subjects in the 4 to <12 
years age group, 5 subjects in the <4 years age group, and 1 subject in the 12 to <16 years age 
group. All of the TEAEs of irritability were mild or moderate in intensity, were not serious, and did not 
lead to discontinuation from the study. Eight TEAEs of irritability were considered related to study 
medication. The majority of TEAEs of irritability were resolved or resolving; 1 event was not resolved 
as of the clinical cut-off date. Eight subjects (2.6%) experienced 10 TEAEs of aggression as of the 
clinical cutoff date. Two of the TEAEs led to discontinuation from the study. Seven of the 10 events 
were resolved, 1 was resolving, and 2 were not resolved. 
Two subjects (0.7%) experienced mild, non-serious, and unrelated TEAEs of developmental delay 
(reported terms: developmental delay and global developmental delay). One subject was an infant 
(8 months) and the other was 4 years old at the time of starting study participation. The onset of the 
TEAE was reported on relative Day 1 of LCM exposure for the 4-year-old and on relative Day 351 for 
the infant.  
One male subject (0.3%; 12 years old) experienced a mild TEAE of gynecomastia. The TEAE was not 
serious, did not lead to discontinuation from the study, was considered not related to study medication 
by the investigator, and was not resolved. At the time of entry into EP0034, the subject’s body mass 
index was 24.7kg/m2. No change in Tanner Stage was observed from Baseline to Visit 5 (Week 20). 
Autism spectrum disorder, impulse control disorder, impulsive behavior, personality change, 
cushingoid, and growth hormone deficiency were each experienced by 1 subject (0.3%) overall. All of 
these TEAEs were experienced by subjects 4 to <16 years of age. All of these TEAEs were mild or 
moderate in intensity, were not serious, and did not lead to discontinuation from the study. These 
TEAEs were all considered not related to study medication by the investigator, with the exception of 
personality change, which was considered related. As of the clinical cutoff date, the TEAEs of autism 
spectrum disorder, impulse control disorder, cushingoid, and growth hormone deficiency were not 
resolved. 
•  Achenbach scales 
The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6-18 (CBCL/6-18) took into consideration the T-score 
findings at eight syndromes: Aggressive Behavior, Anxious/Depressed, Attention Problems, Rule-
breaking Behavior, Social Problems, Somatic Complaints, Thought Problems, Withdrawn/Depressed. 
This was assessed for the age groups ≥6 to <12 years (N=80), ≥12 to <16 years (N=46), Total ≥6 to 
<16 Years (N=126) at the following visits: V1 (Week 0), V5 (Week 20), V9 (Week 52), V11 (Week 72), 
V13 (Week 96), Last Visit (i.e., the last non-missing scheduled or unscheduled assessment during the

Treatment Period. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist for ages 11/2-5 (CBCL/11/2-5) took into 
account younger children - at the same intervals as of the CBCL/6-18 – and scored the following, 
almost overlapping, syndromic traits: Aggressive Behavior, Anxious/Depressed, Attention Problems, 
Emotionally Reactive, Sleep Problems, Somatic Complaints, Withdrawn 
SP848 
Overall, shifts in T-score findings from Baseline to the Last Visit for each of the CBCL/6-18 subscale 
scores as well as for each of the CBCL/1½-5 scores over the Treatment Period were small and stable 
for the majority of the Achenbach syndromes. No overall worsening for any of the Achenbach 
syndromes was observed. Overall and across all sub-scale findings, the majority of study participants 
maintained their Normal finding when examining the shift from Baseline to Last Visit. Of those study 
participants whose findings changed, more study participants showed an improvement than worsened. 
EP0034 
Overall,  shifts  in  T-score  findings  from  Baseline  to  the  Last  Visit  for  each  of  the  CBCL/6-18  subscale 
scores as well as for each of the CBCL/1½-5 scores over the Treatment Period were small and stable 
for  the  majority  of  the  Achenbach  syndromes.  No  overall  worsening  for  any  of  the  syndromes  was 
observed. Overall and across all sub-scale findings, the majority of study participants maintained their 
Normal finding when examining the shift from Baseline to Last Visit (except for 1 study participant in 
Withdrawn  syndrome  who  shifted  from  Normal  to  Borderline).  Of  those  study  participants  whose 
CBCL/6-18  findings  changed,  more  study  participants  showed  an  improvement  than  worsened.  Of 
those study participants whose Achenbach CBCL/1½-5 findings changed, a shift to improvement or to 
worsening was similar. 
SP0969 
Overall, shifts in T-score findings from Baseline to Last Visit for each of the CBCL/6-18 and CBCL/1½-5 
scores  were  similar  for  study  participants  in  the  LCM  and  the  placebo  groups.  Changes  in  T-score 
findings from Baseline to the Last Visit for each of the CBCL/6-18 scores for study participants in both 
the LCM and placebo groups demonstrated slight improvement over the Treatment Period. There were 
basically  no  changes  in  T-score  findings  from  Baseline  to  the  Last  Visit  for  the  CBCL/1½-5  scores  for 
study participants in either the LCM or placebo group. However, these data should be interpreted with 
caution  due  to  the  small  number  of  study  participants  in  each  group  (19  study  participants  and  11 
study participants in LCM and placebo groups, respectively). 
Overall  and  across  all  sub-scale  findings  for  both  the  placebo  and  LCM  groups,  the  majority  of  study 
participants  maintained  their  Normal  finding  when  examining  the  shift  from  Baseline  to  Last  Visit.  Of 
those  study  participants  whose  findings  changed,  more  study  participants  showed  an  improvement 
than worsened. Notably, the shifts observed with LCM appeared to be stable and presented no overall 
worsening over placebo. 
•  BRIEF and BRIEF-P 
The BRIEF two-index scored Behavioral Regulation, Metacognition and Global Executive Composite at 
≥5 to <12 years, ≥12 to <16 years, whereas the BRIEF-P three-index scored Inhibitory Self-Control, 
Flexibility, Emergent Metacognition and GEC  at ≥1 to <2 years, ≥2 to <4 years, ≥4 to <6 years. 
SP848 
Overall,  T-score  findings  at  Baseline  for  each  of  the  sub-scores  in  the  BRIEF  and  BRIEF-P 
questionnaires  were  generally  similar  across  age  groups  except  for  Flexibility  in  BRIEF-P.  Shifts  in  T-
score findings from Baseline to the Last Visit were small and stable for the majority of sub-scores. As 
Assessment report

there were no notable shifts from Baseline to Last Visit in BRIEF T-score findings, the shifts observed 
with LCM appeared to be stable and presented no overall worsening in cognition over time. No overall 
worsening was observed in any of the scores for study participants in the overall population. However, 
due to small sample sizes in study participants ≥4 to <6 years of age, interpretation of BRIEF-P scores 
is limited and should be done with caution. There was a trend for the majority of study participants to 
maintain  their  Normal  finding  when  examining  the  shift  from  Baseline  to  Last  Visit.  Due  to  the  small 
sample  size,  an  interpretation  of  the  3-indexed  scores  (Inhibitory  self-control,  Flexibility,  and 
Metacognition) and Global Executive Composite BRIEF-P T-score findings was not possible. For BRIEF, 
overall  and  across  index  (Behavioral  Regulation  and  Metacognition)  findings,  the  majority  of  study 
participants  maintained  their  Normal  finding  when  examining  the  shift  from  Baseline  to  Last  Visit.  Of 
those  study  participants  whose  findings  changed,  more  study  participants  showed  an  improvement 
than worsened. 
EP0034 
Overall,  T-score  findings  at  Baseline  for  each  of  the  sub-scores  in  the  BRIEF  questionnaire  were 
generally lower in the ≥12 to <16 years age group compared to the ≥5 to 12 years age group. Shifts 
in T-score findings from Baseline to the Last Visit were small and stable for the majority of sub-scores. 
As there were no notable shifts from Baseline to Last Visit in T-score findings, the shifts observed with 
LCM  appeared  to  be  stable  and  presented  no  overall  worsening  in  cognition  over  time.  Overall  and 
across  index  findings,  the  majority  of  study  participants  maintained  their  Normal  finding  when 
examining  the  shift  from  Baseline  to  Last  Visit.  Of  those  study  participants  whose  findings  changed, 
more study participants showed an improvement than worsened. 
Unfortunately, the  BRIEF-P Baseline assessments  were only completed for 2 study participants in the 
≥4  to  <6  years  of  age  category  (n=19)  included  in  EP0034  at  the  time  of  the  clinical  cut-off  date; 
therefore,  no  interpretation  of  BRIEF-P  findings  was  possible.  Similarly,  only  two  study  participants 
reported  findings  for  the  3-indexed  scores  (Inhibitory  self-control,  Flexibility,  and  Metacognition)  and 
Global  Executive  Composite  BRIEF-P  T-score  scale.  These  findings  were  reported  as  Clinically 
Significant  at  Baseline  and  at  Last  visit  for  all  of  the  indexes.  Due  to  the  small  number  of  study 
participants no interpretation can be made at this time for this study. 
SP0969 
Overall,  shifts  in  T-score  findings  from  Baseline  to  Last  Visit  for  each  of  the  BRIEF  and  BRIEF-P  sub-
scores were similar for study participants within the LCM and the placebo groups. Changes in T-score 
findings  from  Baseline  to  the  Last  Visit  for  each  of  the  sub-scores  for  study  participants  in  both  the 
LCM  and  placebo  groups  demonstrated  little  change  over  the  Treatment  Period.  The  shifts  observed 
with LCM appeared to be stable and presented no overall worsening over placebo. However, the data 
for BRIEF-P should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of study participants in each 
group (19 study participants and 11 study participants in the LCM and placebo groups, respectively). 
Due to the low number of study participants, an interpretation of the 3-indexed scores (Inhibitory self-
control,  Flexibility,  and  Metacognition)  and  Global  Executive  Composite  BRIEF-P  T-score  findings  was 
not possible 
For  BRIEF,  overall,  and  across  index  findings  for  both  the  placebo  and  LCM  groups,  the  majority  of 
study  participants  maintained  their  Normal  finding  when  examining  the  shift  from  Baseline  to  Last 
Visit.  Of  the  study  participants  whose  findings  changed,  more  participants  showed  an  improvement 
than  worsened.  This  trend  was  also  observed  when  evaluating  the  summary  of  2-indexed  scores 
(Behavioral Regulation and Metacognition) and Global Executive Composite BRIEF T-score findings by 
visit.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred in study SP847 or in SP848 and EP0034 as of the clinical cutoff date of 30 Nov 
2015.  
A fatal case was identified that occurred after the clinical cutoff date. A subject died from unknown 
causes. The event was judged to be not related to LCM by the investigator. The subject received LCM 
tablets at a dose of 150mg bid. The subject died after 104 days on LCM. The event was reported as a 
suspected car accident or suicide attempt. A history of 2 suicide attempts was reported, but was 
disputed by the subject’s mother. The subject had not reported any TEAEs during the study and had no 
positive responses on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale during the study. Relevant medical 
history included borderline intelligence, behaviour problems, autism spectrum disorder, psychosis, and 
emotional problems. Relevant concomitant medications included methylphenidate, clobazam, 
oxcarbazepine, and levetiracetam. It was concluded that the death remains unexplained due to lack of 
information. 
Other SAEs 
As of the clinical cutoff date, a total of 44 subjects (14.5%) experienced 115 treatment-emergent 
SAEs. The incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was evenly distributed across the older age groups 
(14.3%, 10.1%, and 16.1% for the 4 to <12 years, 12 to <16 years, and ≥16 years age groups, 
respectively). A higher incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was observed in the <4 year age group 
(40.0%). Treatment-emergent SAEs were most common in the SOC of Nervous system disorders for 
the overall Pool SPX-1 (30 subjects [9.9%]) and across age groups (range: 8.9% to 20.0%). 
Convulsion was the most common treatment-emergent SAE overall (17 subjects [5.6%]), and the 
incidence was 6.0%, 4.5%, and 9.7% in the 4 to <12 years, 12 to <16 years, and ≥16 years age 
groups, respectively. Other treatment-emergent SAEs that were observed in ≥2 subjects overall were 
status epilepticus (8 subjects [2.6%]); vomiting (6 subjects [2.0%]); epilepsy (4 subjects [1.3%]); 
constipation, dehydration, diarrhea, and mental status changes (3 subjects [1.0%] each); and 
hematemesis, headache, pneumonia, respiratory distress, and viral pneumonia (2 subjects [0.7%] 
each). All other treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in 1 subject each. Seven of the 8 events of status 
epilepticus occurred during the LCM Exposure Period. The additional TEAE of status epilepticus for 1 
subject occurred 10 days after the last LCM exposure  
Ten subjects (3.3%) experienced 21 treatment-emergent SAEs that were considered related to study 
medication. All related SAEs were resolved or resolving at the time of the clinical cutoff date. With the 
exception of 1 subject with status epilepticus, none of the drug-related SAEs led to discontinuation.  
One severe treatment-emergent SAE of pancreatitis was reported at Day 705 of LCM exposure in a 
subject who was 13 years of age at the start of SP847 study participation. The event was considered 
drug-related by the investigator, resolved after 9 days, did not result in dose change, and did not lead 
to study discontinuation. This event was concurrent with a severe treatment-emergent SAE of 
vomiting, a mild treatment-emergent SAE of diarrhea, and non-serious ongoing events of headache, 
positive occult blood, and increased eosinophil count. Concomitant medications were judged to have 
been a contributing factor to the development of pancreatitis.  
One subject, who was 12 years of age at the start of study participation, had a severe treatment-
emergent SAE of decreased appetite that was considered drug-related by the investigator, led to dose 
reduction, and resolved. The event overlapped with non-serious events of pyrexia and diarrhea and 
was immediately preceded by a non-serious event of decreased appetite. This earlier event of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/124678/2017

decreased appetite was concurrent with a respiratory tract infection, epistaxis, sinusitis, vomiting, 
constipation, and nystagmus.  
Four subjects discontinued the study due to the following treatment-emergent SAEs: status epilepticus 
(2 subjects) and intracranial hemorrhage, hypoxia, and aspiration pneumonia (1 subject each). The 
severe and unrelated treatment-emergent SAE of intracranial hemorrhage leading to discontinuation 
occurred in a subject who had undergone elective electrocortigography-guided resection of right frontal 
seizure focus. Both subjects who discontinued due to the treatment-emergent SAE of status epilepticus 
were 1 year old at the start of study participation. With the exception of 1 subject with status 
epilepticus, none of the treatment-emergent SAEs leading to discontinuation were considered by the 
investigator to be related to study medication. In order to assess the timing of onset of SAEs relative 
to initiation of LCM treatment, the incidence of SAEs was evaluated by 3-month LCM exposure periods. 
Of the 44 subjects who experienced a treatment-emergent SAE, 18 experienced their SAE during the 
first 3 months of treatment. 
For subjects aged 4 to <16 years, a total of 33 subjects (12.8%) experienced 91 treatment-emergent 
SAEs. The incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was lower in the ≥50kg weight band (6.3%) relative 
to the <30kg and 30kg to <50kg weight bands (15.0% and 15.1%, respectively). Although the 
incidence of subjects with treatment-emergent SAEs was similar between the <30kg and 30kg to 
<50kg weight bands, the number of treatment-emergent SAEs was lower in the <30kg weight band 
than the 30 to <50kg weight band (25 SAEs vs 58 SAEs). Within the most common SOC for treatment-
emergent SAEs Nervous system disorders (23 subjects [8.9%]), the incidence decreased with an 
increase in weight with 11.2%, 9.3%, and 4.7% of subjects in the <30kg, 30 to <50kg, and ≥50kg 
weight bands, respectively. This trend was driven by the incidence of the most common treatment-
emergent SAE, convulsion, across weight bands. Convulsion was observed as a treatment-emergent 
SAE in 14 (15 subjects in the updated data set with a data lock at May 2016) subjects (5.4%), and 
included 7.5%, 5.8%, and 1.6% of subjects in the <30kg, 30kg to <50kg, and ≥50kg weight bands, 
respectively. Other Nervous system disorder treatment-emergent SAEs that were observed in ≥2 
subjects included status epilepticus (5 subjects [1.9%]), epilepsy (3 subjects [1.2%]), and headache 
(2 subjects [0.8%]).  
All related treatment-emergent SAEs were resolved or resolving at the time of the clinical cutoff date. 
None of the drug-related SAEs in subjects aged 4 to <16 years led to discontinuation. Of the 33 
subjects aged 4 to <16 years who experienced any treatment-emergent SAEs, 13 experienced their 
SAE during the first 3 months of treatment. 
By modal daily dose category, the incidence of subjects aged 4 to <16 years who experienced 
treatment-emergent SAEs ranged from 0% to 36.7%. This range showed a stepwise increase of 
treatment-emergent SAE incidence with increases in modal daily dose categories. The highest 
incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs (36.7%) was observed in the ≥12mg/kg/day modal daily dose 
category. This included treatment-emergent SAEs of convulsion (16.7%), which occurred most 
frequently in the ≥12mg/kg/day modal daily dose category relative to the other modal daily dose 
categories (range: 0% to 7.1%). None of the subjects in the <4mg/kg/day and 4mg/kg/day modal 
daily dose categories had a treatment-emergent SAE of convulsion. Of the 5 subjects who experienced 
a treatment-emergent SAE of convulsion in the ≥12mg/kg/day modal daily dose category, 2 and 3 
subjects were in the <30kg and 30 to <50kg weight band categories, respectively.

In addition to AEs leading to discontinuation (presented in a dedicated section below), the following 
TEAEs were considered by the MAH other significant AEs for the purpose of the safety assessment of 
the present application: 
•  Hepatotoxicity-related events 
•  Cardiac- and ECG-related events 
•  Suicidality-related events 
•  Additional events: syncope and loss of consciousness 
An overview of the incidence of other significant TEAEs is provided in Table 17.  
No TEAEs were reported for the predefined hepatotoxicity-related terms. 
Two subjects experienced bradycardia and included a 1-year-old subject with a pulse rate of 90 to 
98bpm and a 17-year-old subject with a pulse rate of 55 to 57bpm. Heart rates recorded for these 
subjects on the day of the TEAE were normal for their ages, and neither of these events met the 
predefined criteria for markedly abnormal bradycardia for these studies (<45bpm).  
Two subjects experienced suicidal ideation (a 15-year-old subject and a 10-year-old subject). Self-
injurious behavior was observed for a 5-year-old subject. No TEAEs were reported for other suicidality-
related terms.  
An 11-year-old subject experienced syncope. No TEAEs were reported for loss of consciousness.

Laboratory findings 
Overall, no consistent or clinically relevant treatment-related changes in haematologic, chemistry or 
endocrinology values, or continuous urinalysis parameters were observed. One 2-year old subject 
reported a moderate TEAE of drug-induced liver injury that began 1 day after stopping LCM treatment. 
The TEAE was not serious, considered related to study medication by the investigator, led to 
discontinuation from the study, and was reported recovered after 29 days (study SP847).  
No consistent or clinically relevant changes from Baseline after onset of treatment in vital sign 
parameters were observed that appear to be related to treatment with LCM. No clinically significant 
changes in mean weight, height, or BMI were observed overall or for any age group.  
Relatively small changes from Baseline in ECG parameters were observed across the studies. None of 
these appeared to be clinically relevant. Some of the changes observed could have been due to normal 
physiological changes in parameters as the subjects’ ages increased. At all post-Baseline time points, 
there was no evidence of QT, QTcB, or QTcF prolongation following treatment with LCM. Two subjects 
(1.9%) had abnormal, clinically significant 12-lead ECG interpretations. One subject, aged 11 years, 
had an intraventricular conduction delay at Week 4, and a second subject, aged 2 years, had sinus 
bradycardia (with an averaged heart rate of 100bpm; SP848 interim CSR Listing 9.2.1) at Week 52 
(SP4848). Three TEAEs related to 12-lead ECG findings were reported: a mild TEAE of bundle branch 
block, a moderate TEAE of ECG QT prolonged (QTcB of 465ms at Week 4, and a mild TEAE of ECG 
abnormal. One 10-year-old subject had abnormal, clinically significant 12-lead ECG interpretations at 
Visit 2 (Week 4) and at an unscheduled visit (Week 8). The subject had a first degree AV block 
(intraventricular conduction defect) at both visits which was considered by the investigator to be 
clinically significant. The subject also had an abnormal ECG at Baseline (intraventricular conduction 
defect). One TEAE related to 12-lead ECG findings was reported. A 6-year-old subject experienced a 
TEAE of ECG QT prolonged on Day 11 while on a dose of LCM 10mg/kg/day. The TEAE was considered 
mild in intensity, not serious, related to study medication by the investigator, led to withdrawal from 
the study, and resolved after 55 days  
The incidence of shifts in neurological examination findings from normal at Baseline to abnormal, 
clinically significant at the Last Visit was low overall and for each age group after administration of 
LCM.  
Safety in special populations 
No racial difference was observed for the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation. While there 
were some differences with regards to common TEAEs for white, black, and Asian subjects, no new 
race-based safety signal was observed with the available data from Pool SPX-1.  
No notable trends based on gender were observed for duration of exposure, maximum or mean LCM 
use, or reasons for study discontinuation. In general, the TEAE profile was similar across genders with 
some slight increases for dizziness and pyrexia among females. 
The study population of SP847 and SP1047 did not include any paediatric patients with renal 
impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment was not evaluated in the pediatric studies.  
Of the 303 subjects in Pool SPX-1, 114 subjects were enrolled in EU-member states; 96 subjects were 
enrolled in North America; 74 subjects were enrolled in Asian/Pacific/other regions; 12 subjects were 
enrolled in Latin America; and 7 subjects were enrolled in non-EU member states. While some 
differences were noted for incidence of study discontinuation and of any TEAEs across regions, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/124678/2017  
Page 56/78 
 
 
 
 
 
higher incidence rates were within regions with longer mean durations of exposure. No new region-
based safety signal was raised with the available data from Pool SPX-1. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies have been performed in paediatric subjects.  
Based on results from the covariate analyses conducted in CL0177 (see section 2.4.2.2. ), co-
administration of the hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin 
increased LCM CL. This is consistent with a previous population PK analysis of the pivotal adult studies 
showing that concomitant treatment with other AEDs known to be enzyme inducers decreased the 
overall systemic exposure of LCM by 25%. 
Furthermore, subgroup analysis performed in adult patients did not identify an increased magnitude of 
PR prolongation in patients with concomitant administration of carbamazepine or lamotrigine in clinical 
studies. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 21 subjects (6.9%) experienced a total of 28 TEAEs leading to discontinuation in the last 
study in which they participated. Among these 21 subjects, the incidence of TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation decreased with an increasing age (3 subjects [20.0%] in the <4 years age group, 13 
subjects [7.7%] in the 4 to <12 years age group, 4 subjects [4.5%] in the 12 to <16 years age group, 
and 1 subject [3.2%] was in the ≥16 years age group). The most common TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation were dizziness (5 subjects [1.7%]); convulsion (4 subjects [1.3%]); and aggression, 
rash, and vomiting (2 subjects [0.7%] each). The majority of subjects with TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation experienced their event within 3 months of starting the study (16 subjects). 
The majority of subjects aged 4 to <16 years with TEAEs leading to discontinuation experienced their 
event within 3 months of starting the study (12 subjects) and included 5, 2, and 5 subjects in the 
<30kg, 30kg to <50kg, and ≥50kg weight bands, respectively.  
Related TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the last study in which the subject participated included 
dizziness (5 subjects); vomiting (2 subjects); aggression and rash (2 subjects each); and abdominal 
pain upper, abnormal behavior, blindness, ECG QT prolonged, fatigue, nausea, sedation, status 
epilepticus, and vision blurred (1 subject each). All related TEAEs leading to discontinuation were 
resolved at the time of clinical cutoff date, and all were considered non-serious, with the exception of 
the event of status epilepticus.  
The moderate event of blindness leading to discontinuation lasted 2 days and resolved. The reported 
term was “loss of vision” and overlapped with the following TEAEs: vomiting, sinusitis, dizziness, and 
upper abdominal pain.  
Four subjects experienced 5 TEAEs leading to discontinuation that were serious (status epilepticus [2 
subjects, both enrolled in SP847] and aspiration pneumonia, hypoxia, and intracranial hemorrhage [1 
subject each], both enrolled in SP848). Only 1 event of status epilepticus was considered related to 
study medication by the investigator.  
Dizziness leading to discontinuation was observed in 5 subjects overall with 4 of these subjects in the 
≥50kg weight band (6.3%).  
Assessment report

Convulsions leading to discontinuation were experienced by 4 subjects aged 4 to <16 years (all in the 
<30kg weight band) and included 2 subjects in the ≥12mg/kg/day modal daily dose category and 
1 subject each in the 10mg/kg/day and <4mg/kg/day modal daily dose categories.  
Post marketing experience 
A total of 88,476,904,750mg of LCM has been distributed worldwide from the time of approval, 
29 Aug 2008 to 30 Nov 2015. The defined daily dose for LCM is 300mg/day according to the World 
Health Organization. It was also assumed that 1 year corresponds to 365.25 days to account for leap 
years.  Based on these assumptions, the total patient exposure to LCM during the cumulative time 
period is estimated at approximately 807,455 patient years. 
To estimate the proportion of LCM prescriptions in the paediatric population, the MAH performed an 
analysis using the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial database (CCMC 2014 v0.4) covering the 
period from 01 Jan 2009 to 31 Dec 2014, and the Truven Health MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid 
database (MDCD 2013 v1.0) covering the period from 01 Jan 2009 to 31 Dec 2013 in the US. In the 
CCMC database, the proportion of LCM prescriptions to pediatric patients ranged from 0.6% after 
including patients <4 years to 9.6% for the 4-<16 years age group. The overall proportion of 
paediatric prescriptions considering patients <18 years was 15.3%. In the Medicaid database 
paediatric prescriptions ranged from 0.8% in the <4 years age group to 13.7% in the 4- <16 years 
age group, and the overall paediatric prescriptions (<18 years) were 20.4% 
UCB Global Safety Database 
For the purpose of the present application, the MAH performed a search in the UCB Global Safety 
database for all post marketing cases (excluding UCB-sponsored interventional clinical study reports) 
from 29 Aug 2008 to 30 Nov 2015 compatible with the use of LCM (any dose and formulation) in 
patients 4 to <16 years of age. Cumulatively, 914 cases were identified reporting 1542 AEs. The 
majority of these cases (796 cases) involved the targeted indication, including 399 cases [50%] with 
LCM adjunctive therapy, 397 cases [50%] with LCM monotherapy, 20 cases [3%] reported with LCM 
i.v. administration and 4 cases [0.5%] reported for LCM loading dose, whereas 118 cases 
(representing 13% [118/914] of total reports) reporting 215 PTs were identified within nontargeted 
indications: Lennox-Gastaut: 24 cases; West Syndrome: 4 cases; Dravet syndrome: 3 cases; Rett’s 
disorder: 2 cases. No particular pattern of AEs was identified in this population in general or in specific 
syndromes.  
Table 18 provides an overview of the most frequently reported adverse events.

Table 18 - Most frequently reported MedDRA preferred terms (N≥20) in patients 4 to 
<16 years of age 
Cumulatively, 12 fatal cases in patients 4 to <16 years of age were identified in the UCB Global Safety 
database. Among these 12 cases, sudden unexpected death in people with epilepsy (SUDEP) was 
reported in 2 patients. These 2 pediatric SUDEP cases were classified as probable SUDEP according to 
the definition given by Nashef et al (2012). One was reported within targeted indication and one in 
non-targeted indications. No new safety concern indicating an increased risk of SUDEP following LCM 
exposure has been identified in patients 4 to <16 years of age. One case presented a chronology that 
might raise suspicion to LCM (5 days), however, LCM was initiated because the patient had not 
responded well to other AEDs and seizures were worsening. There was no information on age at 
epilepsy onset or seizure frequency. Levetiracetam dosage had been reduced to add LCM to his 
treatment regimen, which may have played a role in SUDEP. No consistent pattern of events was 
identified among the fatal cases; the majority of cases were reported with an alternative cause of 
death, including severe pre-existing conditions.  
With regards to cardiac conduction and ECG-related events (as defined in the Risk Management Plan 
[RMP]), the proportion of cases identified in the pediatric population (7/914; 0.8%) was below the 
proportion of cases in adults (patients ≥18 years) (272/12,363; 2.2%) for the same cumulative 
period. A broader search including additional MedDRA PTs not included in the RMP resulted in overall 
21 cases with cardiac conduction and/or ECG-related events in patients within the targeted indication 
including 3 fatal cases (respiratory arrest, cardio-respiratory arrest, and cardiac arrest). Three cases 
were identified under LCM monotherapy; 2 of these cases (sinus arrhythmia and ventricular 
tachycardia lacked information on concomitant drugs and in the remaining case (palpitations), LCM 
monotherapy use was clearly reported but the case was poorly documented.  
A total of 6 suicidal related cases were identified in patients 4 to <16 years of age. The proportion of 
cases identified in the paediatric population (6/914; 0.7%) was below the proportion of cases in adults 
(patients ≥18 years) (216/12,363; 1.7%) for the same cumulative period.

Cumulatively, 38 cases of dizziness were identified in patients 4 to <16 years of age. The majority of 
events were non-serious (34 cases, 89 %). The proportion of cases with a PT of Dizziness in patients 4 
to <16 years of age (38/914; 4.2%) was below the proportion of cases in adults (patients ≥18 years) 
(1179/12,363; 9.5%) for the same cumulative period.  
There were no fatal hepatotoxicity-related cases. The proportion of cases identified in patients 4 to 
<16 years of age (4/914; 0.4%) was below the proportion of cases in adults (patients ≥18 years) 
(129/12,363; 1%) for the same cumulative period.  
The search revealed a total of 47 cases of worsening of seizures. The proportion of cases identified in 
patients 4 to <16 years of age (47/914; 5.1%) was below the proportion of cases in adults (patients 
≥18 years) (810/12,363; 6.5%) for the same cumulative period.  
With regards to drug abuse, 1 case of euphoric mood in the targeted indication was identified) male 
adolescent patient with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder reporting extreme euphoria and 
increased heart rate). There was no suspicion of drug abuse in this case. The proportion of cases 
identified in patients 4 to <16 years of age (1/914; 0.1%) was equal to the proportion of cases in 
adults (patients ≥18 years) (17/12,363; 0.1%) for the same cumulative period.  
Cumulatively, 86 cases reporting potential lack of efficacy within the targeted indication were identified 
in the paediatric population. Three cases involved the LCM i.v. formulation. There were no fatal cases.  
Long term effects on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, puberty and childbearing 
potential in children were identified in 6 cases in patients 4 to <16 years of age, including 5 in the 
targeted indication. The reported PTs were Learning disability (2), Attention deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (1), Conduct disorder (1), Distractibility (1) and Learning disorder (1).  
•  Cases reported under LCM as monotherapy  
A total of 397 cases compatible with the use of LCM as monotherapy were identified in targeted 
indication including 5 fatal cases. Fatalities occurred in patients with alternative cause of death, 
including severe pre-existing conditions or were too poorly documented for causality assessment. In 
only one fatal case, there was clear mention of LCM as monotherapy (LCM i.v. 25mg bid) but the 
patient also received thiopental and midazolam for a long period. Cause of death was cardiac arrest in 
a 9-year-old patient in prolonged coma for status epilepticus in the context of autoimmune 
encephalopathy (although the search strategy classifies this case in the targeted indication group, the 
context of status epilepticus suggests that this case should be considered in the nontargeted 
indications).  
The most frequently reported PTs in paediatric monotherapy cases in targeted indication were: No 
adverse event (220), Seizure (16), ineffectiveness (15), Dizziness (14), Fatigue (13), Wrong technique 
in product usage process (13) and Nausea (11). Three patients had received a dosage of LCM greater 
than or equal to 600mg/day or 12mg/kg/day.  
•  Cases reported with i.v. LCM   
Cumulatively, a total of 49 cases (representing 5% [49/914] of total report) involving usage of LCM 
i.v. formulation were identified in patients 4 to <16 years of age. These included 20 cases in the 
targeted indication including one fatal case (same as reported above for LCM monotherapy). Among 
the 19 remaining cases, LCM indication was Seizure (9), Epilepsy (2) and not reported in the 8 
remaining cases.

Scientific publications  
A literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, and SLIM (the UCB Safety Literature Information Management 
database) to identify any relevant publications regarding LCM use in the pediatric population yielded 55 
hits. Of those, 22 were full text articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  From these 
data, the most common indication for LCM therapy in children appeared to be refractory focal and 
generalized epilepsy. Often the formulation was not specified and the majority of studies were 
adjunctive therapy use. Only 2 studies (Heyman et al, 2012 and Yorns et al, 2014) reported in any 
detail the data from monotherapy in children. The reduction in seizures and AEs in these studies did 
not differ from the results of the adjunctive therapy studies presented. A reduction of seizure 
frequency equal to or greater than 50% was achieved in most studies with a prevalence ranging from 
22-66%. Most of the studies reviewed reported an overall incidence of AEs which ranged between 20 
and 60%. The most common AEs included nausea, vomiting, dizziness, ataxia, irritability, and 
drowsiness.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary safety analysis in support of the present application was based on pooled data from three 
open labelled studies (SP847, SP848 and EP0034) in paediatric patients with POS using adjunctive LCM 
treatment (Pool SPX-1). Pool SPX-1 included from a total of 303 paediatric patients. Among these were 
101 patients aged 4 to 16 years old who were exposed to treatment with LCM for more than 12 
months. The size of the safety database thus fulfilled the minimum requirements in line with a 
previous CHMP scientific advice and ICH guideline E1.  
However, the safety pool had a number of limitations as it did not include any data for use in 
paediatric patients receiving LCM monotherapy or i.v. LCM. All patients in SPX-1 received concomitant 
AED treatment; half of the patients used 2 different AEDs and the most commonly used AEDs were 
levetiracetam, valproate and lamotrigine. The safety of LCM monotherapy, for which the maximum 
recommended dose is higher than in the adjuvant setting, was only supported by post-marketing data. 
Given that in adult patients with epilepsy, the safety profile of LCM was similar when used as add-on 
treatment compared to monotherapy, the CHMP considered the lack of additional data acceptable as it 
was reasonable to assume that the safety profile of LCM monotherapy and add-on therapy would be 
similar in paediatric patients from 4 years of age, too. With regards to i.v. LCM, given the high 
bioavailability of oral LCM and since bioequivalence of oral and i.v. LCM formulations had previously 
been shown, the CHMP considered it acceptable to support the use of i.v. LCM in the paediatric 
population by population PK analysis only. Furthermore, no data were available for initiation of LCM 
treatment with a loading dose. Given that the use of a loading dose is only proposed to be extended 
from adults and adolescents aged 16 to 18 years to children and adolescent patients weighing ≥50 kg, 
which was supported by population PK analyses, the lack of safety data in the wider paediatric 
population was considered acceptable.  
The proposed dose regimen for paediatric patients is based on body weight. Therefore, safety analyses 
not only by age, but also by weight bands were considered relevant.  
Among the patients aged 4 to 16 years and exposed for >12 months, half of all patients were in the 30 
to <50 kg weight group (48/101, 47.5%). Most patients in the <30 kg weight group were exposed to 
LCM doses in the upper dose range (8, 10 and 12 mg/kg /day), while only 5 patients in the ≥50kg 
weight band received 10 mg/kg/day dose, which is above the highest dose proposed in this application 
for adjunct therapy of children and adolescents weighing 50 kg or more and adults. Most children aged 
12 to <16 years or weighing ≥50kg were exposed to 4 mg/kg/daily dose. In general, the most 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/124678/2017  
Page 61/78 
 
 
 
 
 
common modal daily dose decreased with increasing weight and age category. The median duration of 
exposure was longest in the 30 to<50 kg weight group (387.5 days). Median modal dose in patients 
treated longer than a year was higher compared to the modal dose in the overall population. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in patients aged 4 to <16 years were vomiting (17.1%), dizziness 
(16.7%), pyrexia (14.1%), somnolence (12.1%), and headache (11.7%). Convulsion was reported in 
10.1% of patients. Furthermore, decreased appetite (6.6%), lethargy (4.3%) and abnormal behaviour 
(1.9%) were observed. In general, the reported pattern and frequency of TEAEs was consistent with 
the most common adverse events in adult subjects.   
The proportion of patients reporting TEAEs as well as the total number of TEAEs decreased with age in 
the overall paediatric population. Furthermore, younger children discontinued more often due to AEs 
and lack of efficacy compared to the older ones. With regards to SAEs, there were more treatment 
emergent SAEs in the <50kg weight group compared to patients weighing ≥50 kg, however, the 
percentage of patients reporting drug related SAEs increased with age.  
AEs potentially associated with polyols included gastrointestinal AEs, and were specifically considered 
in line with a previous CHMP scientific advice in regards to pediatric clinical studies using the LCM 
syrup formulation containing sorbitol. All patients in study SP847 as well as some patients in studies 
SP848 and EP0034 (patients in the weight band group <50kg) received LCM syrup. The most common 
gastrointestinal AEs related to use of sorbitol are diarrhoea, flatulence and abdominal pain. The AE of 
diarrhoea was reported by 7 subjects [14.9%] in the study SP847. Two SAEs of diarrhoea were 
reported in patients in the weight band of <50kg in the Pool SPX-1. Based on these data and given 
that diarrhoea was already reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC of Vimpat as a common adverse 
reaction, no further updated of the product information (PI) was considered necessary by the CHMP. 
Patients in the 4 to <12 years old group experienced pyrexia (16.7%), irritability (5.4%), 
nasopharyngitis (22.6%), upper respiratory tract infection (11.3%) and decreased appetite (7.1%) 
more frequently than patients in the older age groups. Pyrexia was also frequently observed in 
paediatric patients in the <30kg weight group (22.4%). Most cases of pyrexia were related to some 
form of infection. In patients who experienced pyrexia without apparent infection (n=11) all cases 
except 2 resolved within one day and treatment was not discontinued. All cases were mild or moderate 
in severity. It was concluded that pyrexia was most likely one of the symptoms of an underlying 
infection. The increased rate in younger children was thus not surprising as infections occur more often 
younger children. 
In order to dissect the safety profile of LCM in the patient population relevant for the claimed 
indication, two age ranges were investigated by the MAH: 4 to <12 years and 12 to <16 years. As the 
younger age range (8 years) was much larger than older one (4 years), a diluting effect not allowing a 
proper characterisation of the frequency of AEs in the youngest children could not be excluded. All of 
the AEs occurred with higher incidence in the 4 to <12 years compared to the 12 to <16 age group. 
When analysing the data by2-year period subgroups in the 4 to <12 years age range for patients 
receiving LCM for at least 1 year, although the overall numbers were often small, it could be observed 
that vomiting and pyrexia prevailed in the 4 to <6 years subgroup, nasopharyngitis was more 
prevalent in the 6 to 8 years subgroup, headache and dizziness prevailed in both the 8 to <10 years 
and 10 to <12 years subgroups. Overall, no particular signals of change for the incidence of common 
TEAEs was observed. 
The highest incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs (36.7%) was observed in the ≥12 mg/kg/day 
modal daily dose category. In this category, the reported SAEs were convulsion (16.7%), status 
epilepticus (6.7%), vomiting (10.0%) and mental status changes (6.7%). A substantial proportion of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/124678/2017  
Page 62/78 
 
 
 
 
 
patients receiving the 12mg/kg/day dose belonged to the <30 kg weight band (21.5%). The highest 
incidence of the SAE of convulsion was reported in the <30 kg weight group (7.5%) and decreased 
with increasing body weight (5.8% in the 30 to <50 kg group and 1.6% in the ≥50 kg dose group). 
Four patients in the <30 kg weight band (4 subjects [3.7%]) discontinued treatment due to 
convulsion. These 4 subjects included 2 subjects in the ≥12 mg/kg/day modal daily dose category and 
1 subject each in the 10 mg/kg/day and <4 mg/kg/day modal daily dose categories. Further analysis 
of the cases of convulsion and status epilepticus focusing on the 4 to <12 years age group after 
updating the data lock to 02 May 2016 for Pool SPX-1 did not reveal a strong causal association with 
the use of study drug. However, the CHMP, while acknowledging the difficulties in evaluating the 
relationship between convulsions and LCM given the underlying epileptic condition and the 
heterogeneity of factors involved in the clinical spectrum, considered that a causal association could 
not be excluded. The CHMP noted the MAH’s claim that in study SP0969, a lower incidence of 
convulsions in the LCM treatment group (4/171, 2.3%) was reported versus the placebo group (8/172, 
4.7%). However, as the full study report was not available at the time of this report, this claim was not 
considered sufficiently reassuring to confidently refute a causal relationship. Consequently, convulsion 
was included as an adverse reaction in SmPC section 4.8 at a frequency ‘not known’. With regard to 
status epilepticus the fact that most events were considered unrelated to study treatment was 
considered reassuring. 
Furthermore, no data from electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring have been submitted within the 
primary safety pool of this application, and thus the potential of LCM for electro-clinical worsening of 
seizures was unclear. Other sodium channel modulators including oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine 
are known to exacerbate both seizures and interictal EEG abnormalities in certain paediatric syndromes 
such as Dravet syndrome, Doose syndrome, Rolandic epilepsy, in which multi-focal and generalized 
abnormalities may coexist in the same subject. The only paediatric EEG data collected in UCB clinical 
studies and available at the time of this report were derived from the ongoing study SP0966. SP0966 
is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, exploratory study to investigate the safety and efficacy of LCM as 
adjunctive therapy in subjects >1 month to <18 years with epilepsy syndromes associated with 
generalized seizures. The study population in SP0966 was thus different than the target population of 
the present application (POS). Within the 4 to <12 years age group, the mean counts of generalized 
spike-wave discharges during the 24-hour ambulatory EEG declined. However, within the 12 to <18 
years age range the mean count of generalized spike-wave discharges increased. As the number of 
study subjects was small and the data not definitive since the study is still ongoing, the EEG data 
should be interpreted with caution. Overall, based on the available data at the time of this report, it 
could not be excluded that LCM like other sodium channel modulators could also induce electro-clinical 
worsening in paediatric epilepsy patients in whom focal and generalized abnormalities coexist. A 
warning statement was therefore included in SmPC section 4.4 to alert prescribers to clinical situations 
in which focal and generalised seizures coexist and where LCM is considered for treatment. 
The safety database only included limited data on long-term cognition, growth, and development in 
paediatric subjects. In addition to an analysis of paediatric growth-, neurodevelopment-, behaviour-, 
and endocrine-related TEAEs from safety pool SPX-1, the MAH also presented, during the course of the 
procedure, interim data from Achenbach, BRIEF-P, and BRIEF scales collected in the open-label parts 
of SP848 and EP0034 as well as SP0969 in paediatric patients receiving LCM adjunctive therapy for 
POS. These were descriptive data and respective shift tables showing the change from baseline in the 
respective cognitive tests. Although the proportion of subjects for whom the evaluations were missing 
or not done post-baseline was sometimes large, there were no significant shifts either towards 
worsening or improvement for CBCL/6-18 and CBCL/11/2-5 throughout any of the studies. The same 
held true for BRIEF and BRIEF-P. It is acknowledged that the small sample size hampered a reliable

interpretation of the two- and three-indexed scores and Global Executive Composite BRIEF-P T-score 
findings and as such these data cannot be considered exhaustively informative. However,. Impact on 
long-term growth, long-term neurodevelopment, and on puberty in the paediatric population aged 4 to 
< 16 years is listed as missing information in the RMP of Vimpat and more data are expected from the 
continued assessment of cognition and behaviour in studies SP848 and EP0034. 
Finally, suicidal ideation was experienced by 2 subjects (a 15-year-old subject and a 10-year-old 
subject) and self-injurious behaviour was observed in a 5-year-old subject. The event of self-injurious 
behaviour was not resolved by the clinical cut-off date, and was considered related to LCM. Suicidal 
ideation events were considered by the investigator not related to study medication and resolved. 
None of these events resulted in the subject’s discontinuation from the study. Irritability, aggression, 
and suicidal ideation events are already listed as adverse reactions in the SmPC of Vimpat. Given that 
for the paediatric population these events emerged during the clinical trials, the SmPC should be 
amended to reflect the new finding (compared to the previous reference to post marketing experience 
only).  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The CHMP concluded that the available safety data were sufficient to support the present extension of 
the indication for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of POS to adolescents and 
children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. The observed paediatric safety profile was generally 
consistent with the established safety profile in adult patients. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The Annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.7.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP): 
The PRAC considered that the RMP version 12.2 (dated 14 June 2017) is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed the RMP version 12.2 with the following content:

The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the notification of the Commission Decision, an 
updated version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the 
Opinion should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
2.8.  Update of the Product information 
Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been updated. Particularly, 
a new warning has been added with regard to the potential for electro-clinical worsening in specific 
epileptic syndromes. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The main changes to SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 for the syrup formulation are summarised below 
(additions are shown in bold and underlined, deletions in strike-through). The full PI with all changes 
included is provided as attachment to this report.

Vimpat is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures 
with or without secondary generalisation in adults, and adolescents and children from 4 years of 
age(16-18 years) patients with epilepsy.  
•  SmPC section 4.2: 
Posology  
Lacosamide must be taken twice a day (usually once in the morning and once in the evening). 
Lacosamide may be taken with or without food. 
If a dose is missed, the patient should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately, 
and then to take the next dose of lacosamide at the regularly scheduled time. If the patient 
notices the missed dose within 6 hours of the next one, he/she should be instructed to wait 
to take the next dose of lacosamide at the regularly scheduled time. Patients should not 
take a double dose. 
Adolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more, and adults

Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired adult and paediatric 
patients (CLCR >30 ml/min). In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients 
with mild or moderate renal impairment a loading dose of 200 mg may be considered, but further dose 
titration (>200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg 
or more and in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤30 ml/min) and in patientsor 
with end-stage renal disease, a maximum maintenance dose of 250 mg/day is recommended and. In 
these patients, the dose titration should be performed with caution. If a loading dose is indicated, an 
initial dose of 100 mg followed by a 50 mg twice daily regimen for the first week should be used. In 
paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with severe renal impairment (CLCR 
≤ 30 ml/min) and in those with end-stage renal disease, a reduction of 25 % of the 
maximum dose is recommended. For all patients requiring haemodialysis a supplement of up to 
50% of the divided daily dose directly after the end of haemodialysis is recommended. Treatment of 
patients with end-stage renal disease should be made with caution as there is little clinical experience 
and accumulation of a metabolite (with no known pharmacological activity).

Hepatic impairment 
A maximum dose of 300 mg/day is recommended for paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more 
and for adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  
The dose titration in these patients should be performed with caution considering co-existing renal 
impairment. In adolescents and adults weighing 50 kg or more, Aa loading dose of 200 mg may 
be considered, but further dose titration (> 200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. Based 
on data in adults, in paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with mild to moderate 
hepatic impairment, a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose should be applied. The 
pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severely hepatic impaired patients (see 
section 5.2). Lacosamide should be administered to adult and paediatric patients with severe hepatic 
impairment only when the expected therapeutic benefits are anticipated to outweigh the possible risks. 
The dose may need to be adjusted while carefully observing disease activity and potential side effects 
in the patient. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of lacosamide in children aged below 16 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
The physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to 
weight and dose.  
Adolescents weighing 50 kg or more 
Dosage in adolescents weighing 50 kg or more is the same as in adults (see above). 
Children (from 4 years of age) and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg 
The dose is determined based on body weight. It is therefore recommended to initiate 
treatment with the syrup and switch to tablets, if desired. When prescribing the syrup the 
dose should be expressed in volume (ml) rather than weight (mg). 
Monotherapy  
The recommended starting dose is 2 mg/kg/day which should be increased to an initial 
therapeutic dose of 4 mg/kg/day after one week. 
Depending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 
2 mg/kg/day every week. The dose should be gradually increased until the optimum 
response is obtained. In children weighing less than 40 kg, a maximum dose of up to 
12 mg/kg/day is recommended. In children weighing from 40 to under 50 kg, a maximum 
dose of 10 mg/kg/day is recommended.

and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg.

Adjunctive therapy  
The recommended starting dose is 2 mg/kg/day which should be increased to an initial 
therapeutic dose of 4 mg/kg/day after one week. 
Depending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 
2 mg/kg/day every week. The dose should be gradually adjusted until the optimum 
response is obtained. In children weighing less than 20 kg, due to an increased clearance 
compared to adults, a maximum dose of up to 12 mg/kg/day is recommended. In children 
weighing from 20 to under 30 kg, a maximum dose of 10 mg/kg/day is recommended and 
in children weighing from 30 to under 50 kg a maximum dose of 8 mg/kg/day is 
recommended, although in open-label studies (see sections 4.8 and 5.2), a dose up to 
12 mg/kg/day has been used by a small number of these children.

Loading dose 
Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in children. Use of a loading dose is 
not recommended in adolescents and children weighing less than 50 kg. 
Children less than 4 years 
The safety and efficacy of lacosamide in children aged below 4 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Lacosamide syrup must be taken orally.  
The bottle containing Vimpat syrup should be shaken well before use. Lacosamide may be taken 
with or without food. 
Lacosamide syrup is provided with a measuring cup with graduation marks (for patients 
weighing 50 kg or more) and with an oral syringe with an adaptor (for patients weighing 
less than 50 kg. Only the measuring cup provided in this pack should be used for dosing of Vimpat 
syrup 10 mg/ml. 
Measuring cup (for adolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more, and adults) 
Each graduation mark (5 ml) of the measuring cup corresponds to 50 mg lacosamide. Lacosamide may 
be taken with or without food. 
Dosing oral syringe (10 ml graduated every 0.25 ml) with an adaptor (for children and 
adolescents from 4 years of age weighing less than 50 kg) 
One full oral syringe (10 ml) corresponds to 100 mg of lacosamide. The minimum 
extractable volume is 1 ml which is 10 mg of lacosamide. As from the 1 ml graduation mark, 
each graduation corresponds to 0.25 ml which is 2.5 mg of lacosamide. 
Instructions for use are provided in the package leaflet.

•  SmPC section 4.8: 
Paediatric population 
The safety profile of lacosamide in open-label studies in adjunctive therapy in children from 
4 years to less than 16 years was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. In 
the paediatric population the most frequently reported adverse reactions were vomiting 
(17.1 %), dizziness (16.7 %), somnolence (12.1 %), headache (11.7 %) and convulsion 
(10.1 %). Additional adverse reactions reported in children were decreased appetite 
(6.6 %), lethargy (4.3 %) and abnormal behaviour (1.9 %). 
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in adolescents aged 16-18 years are expected to be 
the same as in adults. The safety of lacosamide in children aged below 16 years has not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
In addition, convulsion was added in the list of adverse drug reactions with a frequency ‘not known’ 
and with a footnote that it’s been reported in open label studies. 
Furthermore, SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.5 of the SmPC of the syrup were updated to reflect the new 
extended shelf life after first opening as well as the addition of a 10 mL dosing syringe for the 
paediatric population. 
In addition, as the treatment initiation pack is only suitable for children and adolescents from 4 years 
of age weighing 50 kg or more and in adults, SmPC section 4.1 and 4.2 were only updated with 
regards to treatment of POS in adolescents and children accordingly. 
Finally, a combined SmPC for film coated tablets was introduced. Changes were also made to the PI to 
bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by 
the CHMP. Moreover, minor editorial changes were made throughout the Product Information. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet of the syrup 
formulation submitted by the MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as 
set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for 
human use. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet of the solution for infusion, 
and the film coated tablets has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to 
the syrup formulation. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The present application seeks approval of an extension of the indication of Vimpat as monotherapy and 
adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without secondary 
generalisation to adolescents and children aged 4 to <16 years of age with epilepsy.  
Assessment report

Epilepsy is a serious brain disorder characterised by the occurrence of unprovoked recurrent seizures 
due to abnormal, excessive or hypersynchronous neuronal activity. POS originate in a discrete area of 
the cerebral cortex, and may later spread to involve both cerebral hemispheres causing secondary 
generalisation. As recognised in the CHMP Epilepsy Guideline, partial epilepsies in children older than 
4 years have a similar clinical expression to partial epilepsies in adolescents and adults. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Epileptic seizures can be treated with AEDs, aiming at achieving seizure reduction and ideally seizure 
freedom. About 20-30% of epilepsy patients including those with POS are refractory and require 
treatment with a combination of 2 or more AEDs. Despite the availability of numerous treatment 
options for POS (e.g. oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproate, 
levetiracetam, etc.), more than 25% of paediatric patients have inadequate seizure control on 
currently available AEDs or experience significant adverse drug effects (Hadjiloizou and Bourgeois, 
2007). There remains a need for additional, potent AEDs with a positive benefit-risk profile in this 
population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main support for the present application was derived from three open-label studies SP847, SP848, 
and EP0034 investigating the safety, tolerability and PK of LCM as adjunctive therapy in paediatric 
epilepsy patients (aged 1 month to 17 years) with POS. In addition, supportive PK data were obtained 
from the open-label study SP1047. 
No clinical efficacy study in the paediatric population (4 to <16 years) was presented. Instead 
extrapolation of efficacy in both monotherapy and adjunctive therapy of POS as previously established 
in adults was proposed, making reference to the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products in the treatment of epileptic disorders (CHMP/EWP/566/98 Rev.2/Corr). Dose 
recommendations were supported by PK modeling and simulations.   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
There is clinical experience with the use of AEDs as adjunctive or monotherapy treatment of POS in 
children, with comparable treatment benefits to those observed in adults (Chiron et al., 2008). 
Therefore and given that the clinical expression of POS is similar in adults and children aged 4 years 
and older, it was considered acceptable to extrapolate efficacy of LCM previously established in 
adolescents and adults at the same exposure levels.  
Population PK modeling was used to compare exposure levels in paediatric patients and adults. For 
adjunctive LCM treatment a weight-adjusted four-tier paediatric dosing regimen (12 mg/kg/day for 
<20 kg, 10 mg/kg/day for 20-<30 kg, 8 mg/kg/day for 30-<50 kg, 400 mg/day for ≥50 kg) resulted 
in simulated paediatric steady-state plasma concentration without major fluctuations at the weight cut-
offs and fitting well within the adult reference range at LCM 400 mg/day. For monotherapy, the model 
results supported a three-tier paediatric dosing regimen of 12 mg/kg/day for paediatric patients 
<40 kg, 10 mg/kg/day for those 40 to <50 kg and 600 mg/day for those ≥50 kg. Furthermore, the 
model supported use of the adult dose regimen in adolescents weighing 50 kg and more, predicting 
similar exposure levels beyond this weight cut-off.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Not applicable. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety database consisting of pooled data from 303 paediatric epilepsy patients with POS was 
considered of adequate size with 101 patients aged 4 to 16 years old exposed to LCM add-on 
treatment for more than 12 months. In general the reported pattern and frequency of adverse events 
were consistent with the safety profile in adult subjects. The most frequently reported TEAEs in 
patients aged 4 to <16 years were vomiting (17.1%), dizziness (16.7%), pyrexia (14.1%), 
somnolence (12.1%), and headache (11.7%). Decreased appetite (6.6%), lethargy (4.3%) and 
abnormal behaviour (1.9%) were also observed. Notably, pyrexia occurred more frequently in younger 
children and was considered to be most likely a symptom of an underlying infectious disease.  
Convulsion was reported as a TEAE in 10.1% of patients aged 4 to <16 years. The incidence of 
convulsion was highest in the <30kg weight group (12.1%) and 4 patients in this weight band (4 
subjects [3.7%]) discontinued treatment due to convulsion. While it was acknowledged that a 
relationship between convulsions and LCM may be difficult to establish, given the underlying condition 
and the heterogeneity of factors involved in the clinical spectrum of epilepsies, based on the available 
data at the time of this report, a causal association could not be excluded and therefore convulsion 
was added as adverse reaction of unknown frequency in SmPC section 4.8. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
All paediatric patients included in the safety pool received at least one concomitant AED in addition to 
LCM. Safety data for paediatric patients treated with LCM as monotherapy, for which the maximum 
recommended dose is higher compared to the add-on setting, was only available from post-marketing 
reports. Given that in adult patients with epilepsy, the safety profile of LCM was comparable in both 
add-on treatment and monotherapy, it was however reasonable to assume that the same would apply 
to the paediatric population, i.e. that the safety profile of LCM monotherapy in children and 
adolescents from 4 to <16 years will be similar to the add-on use provided the establishment of 
adequate paediatric dosing in both settings. Use of i.v. LCM in paediatric patients was considered 
acceptable despite the lack of safety data (despite very limited post-marketing reporting) given that 
bioequivalence of oral and i.v. LCM formulations has been established and based on PK modelling 
results showing no need for dose adaptations from the oral dose recommendations for i.v. infusions of 
15 to 60 minutes. 
Only very limited data available for long term use was available at the time of this report. The RMP 
includes impact on long-term growth, long-term neurodevelopment, and on puberty as missing 
information, which will be further investigated in ongoing extension studies. 
Very limited EEG data were available at the time of this report impeding the assessment of the 
potential of LCM of causing for seizure exacerbation. It could thus not be excluded that LCM like other 
sodium channel modulators might cause electro-clinical worsening in paediatric epilepsy patients in 
whom focal and generalized abnormalities coexist. A warning statement was included in SmPC section 
4.4 to alert prescribers accordingly.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The favourable effects of LCM as monotherapy and add-on therapy in the treatment of POS are 
extrapolated from clinical studies in adults. These studies showed a clinically relevant reduction in 
seizure frequency with LCM in the add-on setting as well as non-inferiority of LCM compared to 
carbamazepine as POS monotherapy. Using population PK modeling and simulation, adequate weight-
based paediatric dose regimens have been established resulting in exposure levels comparable to adult 
patients at the respective maximum recommended dose levels (400 mg//day for add-on treatment and 
600 mg/day for monotherapy). Based on this and given that the clinical expression of POS is similar in 
adults and children aged 4 years and older, similar treatment benefits of LCM in children and adults 
can be assumed. 
The paediatric safety profile of LCM as evaluated in the add-on open label studies was generally 
consistent with the one previously established in adult and adolescent patients with POS. Adverse 
reactions were mainly related to the CNS (e.g. dizziness, and somnolence) and gastrointestinal system 
(e.g. vomiting). 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits of LCM in the treatment of POS, as previously established in adult patients and 
extrapolated to the paediatric population from 4 years of age, outweighed the risks of mainly CNS and 
gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Therefore the benefit-risk balance of Vimpat as monotherapy and 
adjunctive therapy in the treatment of POS with or without secondary generalisation in adolescents 
and children aged 4 to less than 16 years with epilepsy was considered favourable. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Vimpat is positive.

Extension of Indication to extend the indication for Vimpat to monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in 
the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adolescents and 
children aged 4 to less than 16 years with epilepsy. For the treatment initiation pack, the use was only 
extended to adolescents weighting 50 kg or more as it is not suitable for the weight-based dosing 
regimen recommended for patients weighing less. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 
5.3 of the SmPC have been updated including the addition of a warning of the potential for electro-
clinical worsening in specific epileptic syndromes. The Package Leaflet was updated in accordance. 
Moreover, section 6.3 of the SmPC of the syrup is updated to reflect the extension of shelf life after 
first opening from 4 weeks to 2 months. Furthermore, a 10 mL dosing syringe for the 200 ml and the 
465 ml syrup bottles is introduced as additional dosing device for paediatric population; section 6.5 of 
the SmPC of the syrup presentations is updated accordingly. Finally, the PI was also brought in line 
with the latest QRD template version and editorial amendments were made in several sections. The 
MAH also took the opportunity to introduce a combined SmPC for the film coated tablets. Moreover, 
updated RMP version 12.2 has been agreed. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0183/2015 and the results of these studies are reflected in the SmPC 
and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the 
EPAR module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

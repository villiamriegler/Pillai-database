Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Odefsey 
emtricitabine / rilpivirine / tenofovir alafenamide 
On 28 April 2016 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Odefsey, 
intended for the treatment of adults and adolescents infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 
(HIV 1). The applicant for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences International Ltd. 
Odefsey is a fixed-dose combination of three active substances, rilprivirine, emtricitabine and tenofovir 
alafenamide, and will be available as 25 mg/200 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets (ATC code: J05AR19). 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are substrates and competitive inhibitors of HIV reverse 
transcriptase. After phosphorylation, they are incorporated into the viral DNA chain, resulting in chain 
termination. Rilprivirine activity is mediated by non-competitive inhibition of HIV 1 reverse transcriptase. 
The benefit with Odefsey is its ability to achieve an antiretroviral response with a once daily, single pill 
regimen. The most common side effects are nausea, insomnia and dizziness. 
The full indication is: "Odefsey is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years 
and older with body weight at least 35 kg) infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) without 
known mutations associated with resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) 
class, tenofovir or emtricitabine and with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV 1 RNA copies/mL (see sections 4.2, 
4.4 and 5.1)." It is proposed that Odefsey be prescribed by physicians experienced in the management of 
HIV infection. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

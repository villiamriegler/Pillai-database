3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Alimta  (pemetrexed)  is  an  antifolate  that  exerts  its  antineoplastic  activity  by  disrupting  the  folate-
dependent  metabolic  processes  essential  for  cell  replication.  In  vitro  studies  have  shown  that 
pemetrexed  behaves  as  a  multitargeted  antifolate  by  inhibiting  thymidylate  synthase  (TS), 
dihydrofolate  reductase  (DHFR),  and  glycinamide  ribonucleotide  formyltransferase  (GARFT)  which  are 
crucial  for  the  de  novo  biosynthesis  of  thymidine  and  purine  nucleotides.  Polyglutamated  metabolites 
of  pemetrexed  with  prolonged  intracellular  half-life  result  in  prolonged  pemetrexed  drug  action  in 
malignant cells. 
Alimta  was  granted  a  Marketing  Authorisation  (MA) 
in 
the  European  Union  (EU)  on 
20 September 2004. Alimta is indicated: 
-  in  combination  with  cisplatin  for  the  treatment  of  chemotherapy  naïve  patients  with  unresectable 
malignant pleural mesothelioma; 
-  in  combination  with  cisplatin  for  the  first  line  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology; 
- as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients whose disease has not progressed 
immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. First line treatment should be a platinum doublet 
with gemcitabine, paclitaxel or docetaxel; 
-  as  monotherapy  for  the  second  line  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
With this variation application the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) of Alimta proposed to extend 
the NSCLC maintenance therapy indication to all patients that have received first-line platinum-based 
chemotherapy,  independently  of  the  type  of  agent  the  platinum  is  combined  with.  In  other  words, 
patients need not have received as first line treament a platinum doublet with gemcitabine, paclitaxel 
or docetaxel, but any platinum-containing combination. For this new indication, the proposed posology 
is  similar  to  the  one  authorised  for  pemetrexed  as  a  single  agent:  pemetrexed  500 mg/m2  of  body 
surface  area  (BSA)  administered  as  an  intravenous infusion  over  10  minutes  on  the  first  day  of  each 
21-day cycle. The MAH proposed to update sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

3.2.  Clinical aspects 
3.2.1.  Introduction 
Lung cancer is among the most frequent types of cancer among European men and women and is one 
of  the  few  that  continues  to  show  an  increasing  incidence.  Prognosis  is  poor  with  relative  1-year 
survival rates of approximately 30% and 5-year survival rates around 10%. Although the standardised 
mortality  ratio  is  declining  slightly  in  men  it  is  still  rising  in  women  in  the  vast  majority  of  European 
countries. 
Lung cancer is subdivided in two groups, the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and the non small cell lung 
cancer  (NSCLC).  SCLC  is  recognized  by  its  chemo-  and  radiosensitivity.  NSCLC  is  a  heterogeneous 
group of tumours with common treatment and prognosis. NSCLC accounts for the vast majority of lung 
cancers  (80%,  D’Addario  et  al,  2010).  NSCLC  includes  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (40%  of  cases), 
adenocarcinoma (35% of cases) and large cell (undifferentiated) carcinoma (25% of cases). 
Surgery  is  the  preferred  treatment  of  patients  with  early  disease.  However,  more  than  60-65%  of 
patients  present  with  locally  advanced  (stage  IIIB)  or  metastatic  disease  (stage  IV)  and  are  not 
suitable  for  surgery.  Patients  with  inoperable  NSCLC  are  typically  candidates  for  chemotherapy 
(D’Addario  et  al.  2005;  Azzoli  et  al.  2009;  D’Addario  et  al.  2010;  NCCN  2011).  For  patients  with  a 
disease  staged  as  IIIB  or  IV  the  primary  goal  of  therapy  is  palliative.  Moderate  gains  in  survival  and 
other  outcomes  like  time  to  disease  progression  and  quality  of  life  have  been  shown  with  platinum-
based  chemotherapy.  Despite  recent  advances  in  treatment,  the  prognosis  for  patients  with  locally 
advanced or  metastatic NSCLC remains poor. Only one third of patients obtain an objective response 
with initial chemotherapy, with an overall survival time of 7 to 13 months (Pfister et al. 2004; Wakelee 
and Belani 2005; Sandler et al. 2006; Scagliotti et al. 2008; Manegold et al. 2008; Levy et al. 2010). 
Platinum-based  combination  regimens  with  gemcitabine,  vinorelbine,  or  taxanes  (paclitaxel  or 
docetaxel)  have  been  the  mainstay  for  the  initial  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC 
(Pfister  et  al.  2004;  NCCN  2011).  Platinum-based  doublets  are  preferred  over  non-platinum 
combinations (Azzoli et al. 2009). 
The  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  standard  doublets  has  been  shown  to  improve  upon  the  standard 
chemotherapy  regimens  (Sandler  et  al.  2006).  The  most  recent  ASCO,  ESMO,  and  NCCN  guidelines 
have been updated to add pemetrexed and irinotecan to the list of third generation cytotoxics, as well 
as the addition of bevacizumab to platinum-based therapy (Azzoli et al. 2009; D’Addario et al. 2010; 
NCCN 2011). 
Alimta  (pemetrexed)  was  initially  authorised  in  the  EU  in  the  indications  (combination  treatment  of) 
mesothelioma  and  second  line  NSCLC  (as  monotherapy).  The  second  line  monotherapy  NSCLC 
indication, granted based on the results of the JMEI pivotal trial, was then both extended and restricted 
by two variations of the marketing authorisation.  
With  variation  EMEA/H/C/000564/II/09  (EC  Decision  date:  8  April  2008)  and  based  on  the  results  of 
the JMDB pivotal trial, a first-line NSCLC indication (in combination with cisplatin) was approved. At the 
same  time,  it  had  become  more  and  more  obvious  that  pemetrexed  is  active  only  in  non-squamous 
NSCLC histologies. As a result, the first line indication was limited to non-squamous histologies and the 
originally granted second line was restricted accordingly. 
A  NSCLC  maintenance  indication  after  first-line  chemotherapy  was  approved  in  2009  (variation 
EMEA/H/C/00054/II/15,  EC  Decision  date:  02  July  2009)  based  on  the  results  of  one  pivotal, 
multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled phase III study (JMEN), which compared the 
efficacy and safety of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed plus BSC with that of placebo plus BSC 
Assessment report

in  663  patients  with  locally  advanced  (stage  IIIB)  or  metastatic  (stage  IV)  NSCLC  who  had  not 
progressed after 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy containing cisplatin or carboplatin in combination 
with gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel. 
Another  agent  approved  for  maintenance  treatment  of  NSCLC  patients  with stable  disease  after  first-
line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is erlotinib. However, no studies have examined the benefit 
of  maintenance  therapy  immediately  following  treatment  with  a  pemetrexed-platinum  induction 
regimen.  Pemetrexed-containing  regimens  were  not 
included 
in  previous  advanced  NSCLC 
maintenance  studies,  including  Study  JMEN  (pemetrexed),  SATURN  (erlotinib),  and  ATLAS  (erlotinib 
and  bevacizumab  combination)  (Ciuleanu  et  al.  2009;  Cappuzzo  et  al.  2010;  Miller  et  al.  2009).  This 
question  was  addressed  with  the  pivotal  trial  of  this  variation  application,  the  PARAMOUNT  Study 
described in detail below.  
GCP 
The MAH has provided a statement that the PARAMOUNT study was conducted in accordance with the 
ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with good 
clinical practices (GCPs) and the applicable laws and regulations. 
3.2.2.  Clinical Efficacy 
The main study supporting this application was the PARAMOUNT (H3E-EW-S124) study.  
PARAMOUNT (H3E-EW-S124) 
This  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  Phase  III  study,  comparing  the  efficacy  and 
safety  of  maintenance  pemetrexed  plus  best  supportive  care  (BSC)  with  that  of  placebo  plus  BSC  in 
patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  Stage  IIIB/IV  NSCLC  who  had  not  progressed  after  4  cycles  of  induction 
therapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin.

Figure 1: Study design for protocol PARAMOUNT 
a  Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2, Day 1) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2, Day 1). b  Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2, Day 1). Patients 
who  required  a  dose  reduction  of  pemetrexed  during  induction  treatment,  and  who  were  eligible  to  receive 
maintenance treatment, started blinded maintenance treatment (pemetrexed or placebo) at the reduced dose.  
c  Subsequent cycles during the maintenance phase followed the same guidelines as Cycle 6. Patients were allowed 
to continue to receive study therapy until 1 of the reasons for discontinuation of study drug was met.

All  patients were  treated  during induction  with  AC  (pemetrexed  500  mg/m2  plus  cisplatin  75  mg/m2 
on Day 1 of a 21 day-cycle, completion of four cycles was required per protocol). 
Patients  with  a  documented  Complete  Response  (CR),  Partial  Response  (PR),  or  Stable  Disease  (SD) 
after  completion  of  induction  chemotherapy  and  an  ECOG  (Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group) 
performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 were randomly assigned to receive as maintenance: 
Experimental Arm A: pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 21 days + BSC 
Control Arm B: placebo on Day 1 every 21 days + BSC 
All patients enrolled into this study received pemetrexed and were required to take folic acid, vitamin 
B12, and dexamethasone (as described in the SmPC of Alimta). All randomised patients were required 
to take vitamin supplementation and dexamethasone during the maintenance phase of the treatment 
period  to  maintain  the  double-blind  design  of  the  study.  Maintenance  therapy  continued  until  the 
patient met 1 or more of the specified reasons for discontinuation, including Progressive Disease (PD). 
Objectives 
The  objective  of  this  trial  was  to  compare  maintenance  therapy  with  pemetrexed  plus  BSC  versus 
placebo  plus  BSC  in  patients  with  stage  IIIB  (with  pleural  effusion  and/or  positive  supraclavicular 
lymph nodes) or stage IV non-squamous NSCLC whose disease had not progressed during 4 cycles of 
pemetrexed and cisplatin induction chemotherapy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Objective Progression Free Survival (PFS) was the primary efficacy variable in this study. Objective PFS 
time was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the first date of objectively determined 
PD or death from any cause. For patients not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who 
did not have objective PD, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease 
assessment. 
Investigator  assessments  of  radiological  data  were  considered  primary  for  the  analyses  of  PFS  [and 
objective  tumour  Response  Rate  (RR)].  An  independent  review  of  radiological  data  (lesion 
measurements based on CT scans) was conducted and any revisions of measurements resulting from 
the review were used for sensitivity analyses. 
Secondary  endpoints  included:  Overall  Survival  (OS),  objective  tumour  Response  Rate  (RR)  assessed 
using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors), patient-reported outcomes using the EQ-
5D  questionnaire  and  toxicity  [AEs  rated  using  the  National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  CTCAE  (Common 
Terminology Critertia for Adverse Events) scale].  
Overall survival (OS) time was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death 
from any cause. For patients not known to have died as of the data cut-off date, OS was censored at 
the last contact date (last contact for patients in post-discontinuation period = last known alive date in 
mortality status). 
The EQ-5D (EuroQol Group 1990) is a standardised, non-disease-specific instrument for describing and 
valuing health status that has been used previously with cancer patients (Pickard et al. 2007). The EQ-
5D is a self-administered health-status questionnaire consisting of 2 parts.  
  The  first  part  includes  5  descriptive  questions  relating  to  mobility,  self  care,  usual  activities, 
pain/discomfort,  and  anxiety/depression,  on  which  the  patient  is  required  to  rate  his/her  health. 
Each  attribute  has  3  levels:  no  problem,  some  problems,  and  major  problems,  thus  defining  243 
possible health states, to which has been added “unconscious” and “dead” for 245 in all.  
Assessment report  
Page 7/29
 
 
 
   
 
  The  second  part  of  the  EQ-5D  is  a  Visual  Analogue  Scale  (VAS)  that  allows  patients  to  rate  their 
present health condition. Possible scores range from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best 
imaginable health state). 
The  245  health  states  defined  by  the  5-dimensional  descriptive  system  can  be  converted  into  a 
weighted  health-state  index  by  applying  a  method  described  in  detail  by  Dolan  (1997).  This  method 
permits  the  measurement  of  preferences.  The  possible  values  for  health  utility  ranges  from  -0.59 
(severe  problems  in  all  5  dimensions)  to  1.0  (no  problem  in  any  dimension)  on  a  scale  where  0 
represents  death  and  1  represents  the  best  possible  health  state  (Shaw  et  al.  2005).  The  EQ-5D  has 
been translated and validated into 102 official languages, including French, German, and Spanish. The 
EQ-5D  was  completed  by  only  those  patients  for  whom  a  translation  is  available  in  his/her  native 
language. Patients were expected to complete the questionnaire at the following times: 
  at baseline, after consent 
  on  Day  1  of  each  cycle  of  induction  therapy  (The  Cycle  1  Day  1  assessment  does  not  have  to  be 
completed if the baseline assessment is completed within 7 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1) 
  on Day 1 of each cycle of maintenance therapy  
  at  the  30-day  post-discontinuation  visit  -  assessments  were  completed  prior  to  treatment 
administration on days that the patient received therapy. 
Sample size 
The sample size of 558 randomised patients was derived assuming the true OS hazard ratio (HR) was 
0.70  and  assuming  390  events  (30%  censoring)  in  the  final  analysis  of  OS.  This  sample  size  was 
selected  for  this  study  to  provide  93%  statistical  power  for  the  final  analysis  of  OS.  Under  the 
assumption that the true PFS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.65, the primary unadjusted log-rank test of PFS 
had 90% power to show a statistically significant difference between arms provided that there were at 
least 238 events included in the analysis. Therefore, the primary analysis of PFS was to occur after at 
least 238 events (57% censoring) of progressive disease or death were confirmed among randomised 
patients. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio, allocating twice as many patients to the pemetrexed plus BSC 
arm. Randomisation was stratified for the following 3 prognostic factors after completion of the first 4 
cycles of induction chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin: ECOG PS just prior to randomisation 
(0 versus 1), tumour response to induction chemotherapy (CR/PR versus SD) and disease stage prior 
to administration of induction therapy (IIIB versus IV). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study.  
Statistical methods 
Baseline  and  efficacy  analyses  used  the  ITT  population  which  included  all  patients  who  were 
randomised (analysed by treatment arm as randomised). 
All  patients  enrolled  in  the  study  (treated  with  at  least  1  dose  of  pemetrexed  or  cisplatin  during  the 
induction phase) were evaluated for safety.  
Assessment report  
Page 8/29
 
 
 
   
 
The type 1 (alpha) error was controlled for the analyses of both PFS and OS, in order to maintain an 
overall  2-sided  alpha  level  of  0.05,  using  the  following  statistical  gate-keeping  and  alpha-spending 
scheme: 
 
The primary statistical test of PFS was performed using a nominal 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
  A 2-sided nominal alpha level of 0.05 was divided between two preliminary and one final analysis 
of OS: a nominal 2-sided level of 0.0001 was spent for each preliminary analysis of OS, leaving a 
nominal  level  of  0.0498  to  be  spent  for  the  final  analysis  of  OS.  If  the  primary  test  of  PFS  was 
statistically  significant,  then  by  application  of  statistical  gate-keeping  the  overall  2-sided  alpha 
level was maintained at 0.05.

Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled on 19 November 2008 and the last patient was enrolled on 23 April 2010. 
At  the  clinical  cut-off  date  (30  June  2010)  179  patients  (pemetrexed:  136,  placebo:  43)  were  still 
receiving maintenance treatment.

Conduct of the study 
There were 2 amendments to the study protocol. The original trial sample size (570 patients treated in 
induction,  399  patients  randomised  to  maintenance  treatment)  was  selected  based  on  a  power 
calculation for the analysis of PFS, assuming a HR of 0.70 and 25% censoring.  
The protocol was amended on 06 October 2008 to include a power calculation for the analysis of OS. 
The  new  sample  size  determined  that  600  patients  treated  in  induction  were  needed  to  provide  372 
patients  randomised  to  maintenance  treatment.  The  calculation  assumed  a  PFS  HR  of  0.65  and  36% 
censoring for PFS, and an OS HR of 0.70 and 30% censoring for OS. The trial would be fully powered 
for PFS (90%) and OS (80%). 
The protocol was amended on 20 July 2009 to increase the power of the OS analysis by increasing the 
number  of  patients  entering  the  induction  and  maintenance  treatment  periods.  The  new  sample  size 
determined that 900 patients treated in induction were needed to provide 558 patients randomised to 
maintenance treatment. The calculation assumed a PFS HR of 0.65 and 52% censoring for PFS, and an 
OS HR of 0.70 and 30% censoring for OS. 
The increase in survival to at least 390 events increased the power of the analysis from 80% to 93%; 
for PFS, 90% power was maintained, provided that at least 238 events were included in the analysis. 
The  final  a  priori  SAP  (version  2)  was  finalised  and  approved  (30  June  2010)  prior  to  data  lock  and 
unblinding of the aggregate database for the final PFS analysis. 
A total of 96 randomised patients (17.8%) were reported to have at least 1 protocol violation. The only 
identified  protocol  violations  for  the  randomised  patient  population  were  for  the  incorrect  dose 
modification  category  (9.5%)  and  the  protocol  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  category  (8.5%).  Protocol 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria  violations 
included  continuing  study  treatment  after  PD  (4.1%), 
randomisation  even  though  response  to  induction  treatment  was  not  CR,  PR,  or  SD  (3.2%), 
randomisation with <4 cycles of induction treatment (1.5%), and randomisation even though PS was 
not  0  or  1  following  induction  treatment  (0.6%).  In  general,  protocol  violations  in  this  study  were 
balanced between study arms. 
Baseline data 
The study arms were balanced with respect to demographic characteristics (see Table 1 below). Among 
all patients randomised, the median age was 61.4 years, and the majority of patients were Caucasian 
(94.6 %), male (58.1 %), and reported a history of smoking (77.7%). The two treatment arms were 
also  balanced  in  terms  of  stratification  factors  (Table  2),  histological  type  of  NSCLC  (Table  3)  and 
concomitant medications received on study (data not shown).

Numbers analysed 
539 patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive pemetrexed plus BSC (359 patients) or placebo 
plus  BSC  (180  patients)  during  maintenance  treatment.  Of  the  randomised  patients,  333 (92.8%)  on 
the  pemetrexed  arm  and  167  (92.8%)  on  the  placebo  arm  received  at  least  1cycle  of  maintenance 
treatment as of the data cut-off date (30 June 2010). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint/Progression-Free Survival 
A total of 302 PFS events (pemetrexed: 184, 51.3%; placebo 118, 65.6%) had occurred at the time of 
database lock; 175 patients (48.7%) in the pemetrexed arm, and 62 patients (34.4%) in the placebo 
arm were censored for the PFS analysis. High-level PFS results are presented in the following table and

Secondary endpoints 
Overall Survival 
PARAMOUNT included a pre-specified preliminary OS analysis at the time of the primary PFS data lock 
(30 June 2010) with a nominal alpha spending of 0.0001. The study was immature in terms of Overall 
Survival  with  high  censoring  rates  (78.6%  and  74.4%  for  the  pemetrexed  and  placebo  arms,

respectively).  A  second  preliminary  analysis  of  OS  was  conducted  again  with  minimal  alpha  spending 
(0.0001)  and  a  data  lock  of  06  June  2011.  The  median  OS  benefit  for  patients  receiving  pemetrexed 
(2.76 months, see Table 5 below) increased by 1.19 months from the first preliminary analysis, which 
had showed  an OS benefit (median) of 1.57 months (data not shown). As with the first analysis, the 
results  of  the  second  analysis  did  not  reach  statistical  significance.  At  the  time  of  this  second 
preliminary  survival  analysis,  48%  of  patients  were  alive  on  the  pemetrexed  arm  versus  38%  on  the 
placebo arm, with a median follow-up of 11.04 months. There were 32 patients still on treatment (29 
pemetrexed, 3 placebo). Per protocol, the final analysis of OS will take place after a minimum of 390 
deaths  have  occurred  among  the  randomised  patients.  The  alpha  level  of  the  final  OS  analysis  is 
0.0498.

June 2010), 179 patients (pemetrexed: 136, placebo: 43) were still in the maintenance treatment phase. 
The independent central review on 471 patients (316 patients in the pemetrexed arm and 156 patients 
in the placebo arm) yielded a tumour RR of 2.8% in the pemetrexed arm and 0.6% in the placebo arm 
(p=0.176). The independently reviewed Disease Control Rate (DCR) was 71.8% for patients receiving 
pemetrexed and 59.6% for patients receiving placebo (p=.009).  
Patient-reported outcomes using the EuroQol 5-Dimensional Scale 
Compliance during the maintenance treatment was 46.2% (163 of 359 patients completed the required 
questionnaire at each of their visits) for the pemetrexed arm and 44.1% (79 of 180 patients completed 
the  required  questionnaire  at  each  of  their  visits)  for  the  placebo  arm.  For  the  post-discontinuation 
visit,  where  the  majority  of  worsening  might  have  been  anticipated,  43.9%  of  patients  in  the 
pemetrexed  and  44.3%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  completed  the  EQ-5D.  The  most  commonly 
reported  reason  for  not  completing  the  EQ-5D  was  failure  by  the  investigative  site  to  administer  the 
questionnaire. 
The EQ-5D United Kingdom (UK) population-based index score was generated from patient responses 
to items on mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. No statistical 
differences in the index scores were observed between the pemetrexed and placebo arms of the study. 
No  statistical  changes  from  baseline  in  index  score  at  a  given  time  point  occurred  over  the  course  of 
maintenance  therapy  for  the  within-patient  population  regardless  of  treatment  arm.  At  the 
discontinuation visit, the index score decreased from baseline for patients in both treatment arms. The 
index  score  of  the  pemetrexed  arm  was  0.77  at  baseline  and  0.66  at  discontinuation  (p<.001)  and 
0.79 at baseline and 0.70 at discontinuation (p=0.022) for placebo.  
No statistical differences in VAS scores were observed between patients treated with pemetrexed and 
patients  treated  with  placebo.  Within  both  treatment  arms,  the  VAS  scores  indicated  an  increasing 
trend  toward  “best-imaginable  health  state”  with  some  significant  increases  from  baseline  at  various 
time  points.  However,  at  discontinuation,  patients  receiving  pemetrexed  reported  a  significant 
Assessment report

decrease  in  health  state  compared  to  baseline.  Patients  receiving  placebo  experienced  a  similar 
decrease  at  discontinuation.  Based  on  the  EQ-5D index  scores  and  VAS  scores,  these  results  suggest 
that  patients  treated  with  pemetrexed  did  not  experience  worse  health  states  over  the  course  of 
maintenance therapy compared to patients treated with placebo. 
Ancillary analyses 
The  MAH  submitted  a  number  of  ancillary  analyses  for  the  primary  endpoint  of  PFS  including  a 
covariate-adjusted analysis (data not shown) and an independent review of data. More specifically, the 
MAH  established  an  independent  review  of  PFS  to  assess  the  potential  for  investigator  bias  in  the 
determination  of  PD  between  study  arms.  Of  the  539  randomised  patients  with investigator  assessed 
PFS,  reviewable  scans  for  472  patients  (87.4%,  316  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and  156  in  the  placebo 
arm) were available for the independent review. The majority of unread scans were due to patients not 
completing 1 cycle of treatment by the data cut-off date (30 June 2010). Reasons for patients omitted 
from the independent review were balanced between study arms. 
Independently  assessed  median  PFS  following  induction  therapy  was  3.94  months  in  the  pemetrexed 
arm and 2.6 months in the placebo arm. The treatment effect was statistically significant (HR = 0.64; 
95% CI: 0.51 to 0.81; Wald’s p =.00025). 
The  MAH  also  submitted  sensitivity  analyses  for  PFS  using  alternative  censoring  rules  (data  not 
shown). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Subgroup analyses based on age and gender are presented in Figure 3. The majority of patients were 
Caucasian (94.6% of patients) and patient numbers from other ethnic origins were too small to draw 
meaningful conclusions. 
Supportive studies 
No  supportive  studies  were  submitted.  The  MAH  made  reference  to  the  previously  submitted  JMEN 
(maintenance treatment after induction with a platinum doublet that did not include pemetrexed) and 
JMDB (first line treatment) trials, but no updated data/analyses from these studies were presented. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  present  application  for  extension  of  the  Alimta  maintenance  therapy  indication  after  first  line 
treatment of NSCLC is mainly based on the PARAMOUNT pivotal study. PARAMOUNT is the first NSCLC 
trial  investigating  pemetrexed  only  in  patient  who  have  a  cancer  with  non-squamous  histology.  This 
can be considered as a consequence of preceding variation procedures limiting the original second line 
indication,  and  the  first  line  (as  well  as  the  maintenance)  indication  of  pemetrexed  to  specific  NSCLC 
histologies. 
The  selection  of  placebo  plus  BSC  as  comparator  is  considered  as  acceptable.  Of  note,  maintenance 
treatment has been challenged in similar settings with various agents, including pemetrexed, following 
a  platinum  doublet  with  gemcitabine,  paclitaxel  or  docetaxel  (JMEN,  see  CHMP  AR  on  variation 
EMEA/H/C/000564/II/15),  suggesting  that  prolonged  therapy  could  be  of  benefit  especially  regarding 
PFS and possibly OS. 
Assessment report  
Page 16/29
 
 
 
   
 
A  total  of  939  patients  were  enrolled,  of  which  539  (57.4%)  were  randomised  2:1  to  study  arms 
(pemetrexed arm N = 359; placebo arm N = 180) in the maintenance phase. All enrolled patients had 
non-squamous  histology  (no  squamous  patients  were  enrolled),  and  the  majority  of  patients  had 
adenocarcinoma  (87.4%).  The  baseline  patient  demographic  characteristics,  disease  characteristics, 
and  prognostic  factors  were  globally  balanced  between  the  study  arms.  There  was  however  a  slight 
imbalance in gender (more female patients in the pemetrexed arm). 
The  dose  and  schedule  of  pemetrexed  were  based  on  the  results  of  studies  JMEI  (second  line 
treatment) and JMEN. Therefore, patients received either 500 mg/m2 pemetrexed or placebo. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 302 PFS events (pemetrexed: 184, 51.3%; placebo 118, 65.6%) had occurred at the time of 
database lock; 175 patients (48.7%) in the pemetrexed arm, and 62 patients (34.4%) in the placebo 
arm were censored for the PFS analysis. 
This  trial  met  its  primary  objective,  as  the  analysis  showed  a  statistically  significant  increase  in 
investigator-assessed  PFS  for  patients  treated  with  maintenance  pemetrexed.  Median  investigator-
assessed PFS was 4.11 months (95% CI 3.15 to 4.57) in the pemetrexed arm and 2.83 months (95% 
CI  2.60  to  3.12)  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  estimated  HR  was  0.62  (95%  CI:  0.49  to  0.79;  Wald’s 
p=0.00007). 
These results correspond roughly with the results of trial JMEN (4.4 months for the Alimta arm and 1.8 
months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47 (95% CI = 0.37-0.60, p=0.00001; subgroup ‘patients 
with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology’). 
A  clear  difference  in  PFS  could  be  observed  from  the  second  month  of  treatment.  This  difference 
remained  in  favour  of  the  pemetrexed  arm  up  to  11  months.  Although  results  are  consistent  in 
subgroups,  there  are  some  subgroups  for  which  the  95%  CI  of  HR  includes  1,  hence  no  difference 
could  be  confirmed  statistically  (see  figure  3).  However,  few  PFS  events  had  occurred  in  these 
subgroups thus leading to wide 95% CIs. 
Preliminary Overall Survival results at the time of the PFS analysis were immature with high censoring 
rates  (78.6%  and  74.4%  for  the  pemetrexed  and  placebo  arms,  respectively).  Data  from  a  second 
preliminary OS analysis were considerably more mature and the censoring rate was already well below 
50%, i.e. the number of events was higher than 50% (299 events) and median OS had already been 
reached.  This  new,  second  preliminary  analysis  showed  an  OS  benefit  for  pemetrexed  maintenance 
therapy vs. placebo with a difference in median OS of about 2.8 months, which did not reach statistical 
significance (p=0.0343) at the minimal (0.0001) alpha-level spent. An alpha spending of 0.0498 is still 
available for the final OS analysis. 
Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Taken  together,  these  results  are  globally  in  line  with  those  already  submitted,  in  that  pemetrexed 
monotherapy, administered as maintenance treatment after pemetrexed/cisplatin induction treatment 
has a significant effect on PFS. 
3.2.3.  Clinical safety 
The safety analysis focused on the pivotal study H3E-EW-S124 (PARAMOUNT). The main focus in this 
section  will  be  on  the  safety  results  from  the  maintenance  treatment  period.  Where  appropriate  and 
meaningful,  PARAMOUNT  results  are  compared  with  results  of  2  previously  submitted  studies  (Study 
JMDB:  pemetrexed  plus  cisplatin  administered  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  advanced  NSCLC;  and

integrated  safety  results  of  the  maintenance  treatment  period  of  PARAMOUNT  and  of  the  JMEN  study 
are also described. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 1622 cycles of  pemetrexed  were administered  to 333 patients in the pemetrexed arm, and 
698  cycles  of  placebo  were  administered  to  167  patients  in  the  placebo  arm.  In  addition,  23.4%  of 
patients in the pemetrexed arm completed >6 cycles of maintenance (representing a minimum of 10 
total  cycles  of  pemetrexed  treatment  [4  cycles  of induction  plus  6  cycles  of  maintenance])  compared 
with only 13.9% of patients in the placebo arm.

conflict and 1 in each arm due to inadequate vitamin supplementation. 
During induction treatment, 62 (6.6%) of patients had dose reductions due to AE. During maintenance 
treatment,  11  (3.1%)  patients  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  had  dose  reduction  compared  to  1  (0.6%) 
patient in the placebo arm. All the dose reductions were due to Adverse Events.

Difference is statistically significant 
In  the  induction  phase,  the  most  commonly  reported  induction  treatment-related  TEAEs  (reported  in 
≥5%  of  patients)  were:  nausea  (36.2%),  vomiting  (21.6%),  neutropenia  (16.3%),  fatigue  (14.9%), 
anaemia  (14.3%),  asthenia  (11.8%),  decreased  appetite  (9.5%),  diarrhoea  (8.8%),  constipation 
(8%), and mucosal inflammation (5.5%). 
A  summary  of  treatment-related  AEs  (Adverse  Drug  Reactions,  ADRs)  occurring  in  at  least  1%  of 
patients in the induction phase of the PARAMOUNT trial and compared to the JMDB trial is presented in 
the following table.

In  the  maintenance  phase  and  in  both  treatment  arms,  the  most  commonly  reported  possibly  study-
drug-related  TEAEs  (reported  in  ≥5%  of  patients)  were  anaemia,  asthenia,  fatigue,  nausea,  and 
neutropenia. Patients receiving pemetrexed experienced a significantly greater number of the following 
possibly study-drug related TEAEs: anaemia (7.5% versus 1.1%, p<.001), neutropenia (4.5% versus 
0.6%,  p=.016),  leukopenia  (3.3%  versus  0%,  p=.011),  increased  lacrimation  (2.5%  versus  0%, 
p=.033), nausea (5% versus 1.1%, p=.028), and asthenia (7.5% versus 1.1%, p<.001). 
All-grade  and  grade  3/4/5  possibly  treatment-related  AEs  (Adverse  Drug  Reactions,  ADRs)  in  the

excluding febrile neutropenia. 
Of  particular  interest,  the  overall  incidence  of  pulmonary  embolism  (PE)  in  the  maintenance 
pemetrexed arm in PARAMOUNT was low, similar between pemetrexed and placebo [0.8% (3/359) in 
the  maintenance  pemetrexed  arm  vs  1.7%  (3/180)  on  placebo],  and  comparable  with  Study  JMEN 
[0.2%  (1/441)  on  maintenance  pemetrexed  and  0.5%  (1/222)  on  placebo].  In  PARAMOUNT,  the 
reporting  rate  for  all  PE  events  possibly  related  to  study  treatment  was  0.6%  (2/359)  in  the 
maintenance  pemetrexed  arm  versus  0.6%  (1/180)  on  placebo.  In  JMEN,  there  were  no  cases  of  PE 
possibly  related  to  study  treatment  in  either  treatment  arm.  Finally,  PARAMOUNT  included  induction 
treatment with pemetrexed plus cisplatin and the incidence of PE during induction was 4.4% (41/939) 
for all events and 0.9% (8/939) for events possibly related to study treatment.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In  both  induction  and  maintenance  phases,  deaths  were  categorised  as  ‘regardless  of  causality’  or 
‘possibly related to study drug’.  
In the induction phase, of all enrolled patients who were treated with at least 1 dose of pemetrexed or 
cisplatin  (N  =  939),  56  (6%)  on-study  deaths  occurred.  There  were  11  possibly  study  drug-related 
deaths.  The  primary  events  included  febrile  neutropenia  (2  events),  diarrhoea,  intestinal  obstruction, 
large  intestine  perforation,  neutropenic  colitis,  renal  failure,  cerebrovascular  accident,  multi-organ 
failure, lung infection and acute renal failure. Of all enrolled, but not randomised patients (N=400), 7 
deaths (1.8%) occurred within 30 days of the last dose of induction treatment; of these, 5 were due to 
study  disease,  1  was  due  to  an  AE  (cerebro-vascular  accident),  and  1  was  a  possibly  study  drug-
related death due to dyspnoea. Deaths >30 days after last dose of induction treatment occurred in 184 
(46.0% of 400) patients treated with pemetrexed plus cisplatin. With the exception of 7 deaths due to 
AEs, the cause of death for these patients was listed as disease progression. 
In the maintenance phase, among all randomised patients (N = 539), 10 on-study deaths occurred (7 
[1.9%]  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and  3  [1.7%]  in  the  placebo  arm).  Of  these,  5  were  attributed  to 
disease  progression  (4  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and  1  in  the  placebo  arm).  Two  deaths  (1  in  each 
treatment  arm)  were  AEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  study  drug 
(pneumonia in 1 patient treated with pemetrexed, sudden death in 1 patient treated with placebo). The 
remaining 3 deaths (2 on pemetrexed, 1 on placebo) were caused by AEs not attributed to study drug. 
Moreover, there were 3 additional deaths within 30 days of the last administered maintenance dose (1 
in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and  2  in  the  placebo  arm).  The  pemetrexed  death  was  due  to  possibly  study 
drug-related  endocarditis.  The  placebo  deaths  were  due  to  disease  progression.  Deaths  >30  days  of 
the  last  dose  of  maintenance  treatment  occurred  in  69  pemetrexed-treated  and  41  placebo-treated 
patients, with the cause of death for the majority of the patients listed as disease progression. 
Compared with the 13 deaths in PARAMOUNT during maintenance treatment and within 30 days of last 
dose, there were 21 deaths during the same period in Study JMEN. In Study JMEN, 11 (2.5%) deaths 
were  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and  10  (4.5%)  were  in  the  placebo  arm,  and  none  were  considered 
possibly related to study drug. Of the 309 deaths reported in JMEN, there were 21 deaths (11 [2.5%] 
in the pemetrexed arm and 10 [4.5%] in the placebo arm) that occurred while patients were on study 
or within 30 days of their last study dose. The remaining 278 deaths occurred >30 days after the last 
study dose. The deaths were primarily related to disease progression. 
Overall,  there  were  no  significant  differences  in  the  reasons  for  deaths  between  the  pemetrexed  and 
placebo  arms  for  the  integrated  analysis  of  the  maintenance  treatment  period  from  PARAMOUNT  and 
Study  JMEN,  except  for  deaths  due  to  disease  progression  >30  days  after  last  dose  (34.5% 
pemetrexed [N = 800] versus 41.0% placebo [N = 402], p=0.03). 
SAEs 
In  PARAMOUNT,  the  most  common  SAEs  possibly  related  to  induction  treatment  were  vomiting  and 
nausea,  occurring  in  2.6%  and  2.3%  of  patients,  respectively.  Eleven  (1.2%)  patients  experienced 
renal failure SAEs (renal acute failure, renal failure) possibly related to induction treatment.  
Similarly  in  JMDB,  vomiting  (4.1%),  nausea  (3.6%),  and  anaemia  (2.6%)  were  the  most  common 
study  drug-related  SAEs,  with  1.4%  patients  with  SAEs  related  to  renal  failure  (acute  renal  failure, 
acute pre-renal failure, and renal failure). 
Assessment report  
Page 23/29
 
 
 
   
 
In  the  maintenance  phase  of  the  PARAMOUNT  study,  8.9%  of  patients  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and 
2.8%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  experienced  a  SAE  that  was  considered  possibly  related  to  the 
study drug (p=.007). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of any individual event. 
The  most  common  SAEs  reported  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  were  anaemia  (2.2%),  followed  by  febrile 
neutropenia (1.4%). 
The  overall  incidence  of  drug-related  SAEs  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  of  PARAMOUNT  (8.9%)  was 
numerically  higher  than  in  JMEN  (4.3%).  The  magnitude  of  change  between  the  pemetrexed  and 
placebo  arms  was  similar  between  the  two  studies.  Consistent  with  PARAMOUNT  results,  anaemia 
(1.4%) was the most frequently reported SAE in JMEN. In the integrated analysis of the maintenance 
treatment period from PARAMOUNT and JMEN, 6.6% of patients in the pemetrexed arm (N = 800) and 
1.2% of patients in the placebo arm (N = 402) experienced a SAE that was considered possibly related 
to  the  study  drug  (p<.01).  Individual  SAE  terms  that  occurred  significantly  higher  in  the  combined 
pemetrexed arm compared to the combined placebo arm included anaemia (1.8% versus 0%; p<.01) 
and febrile neutropenia (1.1% versus 0%; p=.03). 
Laboratory findings 
In the induction phase of the PARAMOUNT trial, there was only study-drug-related Grade 5 laboratory 
toxicity (death), i.e. increased creatinine which was reported as a primary event of acute renal failure. 
Possibly study-drug-related Grade 3/4 laboratory toxicities reported in ≥1% of patients in PARAMOUNT 
included  neutrophils/granulocytes,  haemoglobin,  platelets,  and  leukocytes.  The  overall  incidence  of 
Grade  3/4/5  laboratory  toxicities  (all  enrolled  patients)  possibly  related  to  pemetrexed  plus  cisplatin 
was lower in PARAMOUNT (13.7%) compared to JMDB (22.6%). 
In the maintenance phase of the PARAMOUNT trial, there were no possibly study drug-related Grade 5 
laboratory  toxicities  (deaths)  reported  in  either  study.  Overall,  toxicity  was  low  on  both  arms  in  the 
maintenance treatment period, such that there were few differences between the treatment arms and 
few patients experiencing clinically important AEs. Results in the pemetrexed arm of PARAMOUNT were 
consistent with the laboratory toxicities seen in Study JMEN. Hemoglobin and neutrophils/granulocytes 
were  the  most  common  possibly  study-drug-related  Grade  3/4  hematologic  toxicities  in  the 
pemetrexed arm of both studies, with incidences higher in PARAMOUNT than in JMEN. In the integrated 
analysis  of  the  maintenance  treatment  period  from  PARAMOUNT  and  JMEN,  the  overall  incidence  of 
Grade  3/4  laboratory  toxicities  possibly  related  to  study  treatment  was  significantly  different  in  the 
pemetrexed arm compared to the placebo arm (7.5% versus 1.5%, p<0.01). The following individual 
possibly study-drug-related Grade 3/4 laboratory toxicities were reported in significantly more patients 
on pemetrexed versus placebo treatment arm: haemoglobin (3.5% versus 0.5%; p<0.01), leukocytes 
(1.6%  versus  0.2%;  p  =  0.04),  neutrophils/granulocytes  (3.3%  versus  0%;  p<0.01),  and  platelets 
(1.6% versus 0.2%; p = 0.04). 
Safety in special populations 
The MAH provided safety analyses from the PARAMOUNT study based on age (<65 years and years), 
gender  (male,  female)  and  ethnic  origin  (Asian,  Black/African  American,  Caucasian)  and  comparisons 
of  the  induction  and  maintenance  phase  of  this  study  with  studies  JMDB  and  JMEN,  accordingly.  The 
safety  profile  was  similar  in  the  age  and  gender  subgroups  across  the  various  trials  and  no  age-  or 
gender-specific  differences  in  toxicity  were  noted  (data  not  shown).  No  meaningful  conclusions  could 
be made for ethnic subgroups, as the number of non-Caucasian patient was minimal.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Fifty-one  (5.4%)  patients  discontinued  induction  treatment  because  of  possibly  study-drug-related 
AEs,  the  majority  (16  [1.7%])  were  attributable  to  a  decrease  in  renal  function.  Similarly,  renal 
toxicities were the most common causes of possibly study-drug-related discontinuation in Study JMDB 
(possibly  drug-related  events  of  blood  creatinine,  increased  blood  creatinine,  decreased  creatinine 
clearance, renal failure, acute renal failure, renal impairment, or renal infarct caused discontinuations 
for 32 patients [3.8%] on the pemetrexed plus-cisplatin arm). 
Nineteen  (5.3%)  patients  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and  6  (3.3%)  patients  in  the  placebo  arm 
discontinued study therapy because of study-drug-related AEs. The difference between the 2 treatment 
arms was not significant and no significant differences were observed between the study arms in the 
incidence  of  individual  study-drug-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation.  The  majority  of  non-serious 
drug-related  AEs  causing  discontinuation  (6  patients)  from  the  PARAMOUNT  pemetrexed  arm  were 
attributed  to  asthenia,  fatigue,  and  renal  failure  (2  patients  each).  Seven  patients  discontinued  from 
pemetrexed  therapy  because  of  study-drug-related  SAEs  (1  patient  each,  bone  marrow  failure, 
anaemia,  thrombocytopenia,  arrhythmia,  odynophagia,  febrile  neutropenia,  and  pneumonia).  Two 
patients discontinued from placebo therapy because of study-drug-related SAEs [sudden death (1) and 
dehydration (1)]. 
The  type  of  possibly  study-drug-related  AEs  causing  discontinuation  in  PARAMOUNT  during 
maintenance  treatment  was  similar  to  that  seen  in  trial  JMEN.  In  trial  JMEN,  3.8%  of  pemetrexed-
treated  patients  discontinued  because  of  drug-related  AEs  (both  serious  and  nonserious)  and  0.2% 
discontinued because of drug-related SAEs. 
Post marketing experience 
It is estimated that approximately 491,368 patients have been exposed to pemetrexed worldwide since 
it was first approved on 04 February 2004 to 31 August 2010 if the patients received an average of 4 
cycles and 655,158 patients if they received an average of 3 cycles.  
A total of 2497 spontaneous AE case reports containing 6197 events were identified. Of the 6197 AEs, 
3096  were  classified  as  serious  (1649  listed,  1477  unlisted)  and  3101  were  nonserious  (1866  listed, 
1235 unlisted). 
The  MedDRA  system  organ  classes  (SOCs)  with  the  highest  proportion  of  events  were  General 
Disorders  and  Administration  Site  Conditions,  Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Tissue  Disorders, 
Gastrointestinal Disorders, and Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders. 
Overall,  the  most  frequently  reported  unlisted  events  (>1%)  were  malignant  neoplasm  progression 
(3.31%; 205/6197), dyspnoea (1.18%; 73/6197), and death (1.02%; 63/6197). 
A review of the 368 fatal case reports, including the 63 reports with death coded as an event, did not 
identify any significant new safety information. There were no new trends associated with non-serious 
and serious events that were already listed in the Core Company Data Sheet (CCDS) for pemetrexed. 
In  19.1%  (476/2497)  of  case  reports,  the  patient  received  a  platinum  agent  (either  cisplatin  or 
carboplatin) in combination with pemetrexed as part of combination chemotherapy treatment. 
Discussion and conclusions on clinical safety 
In the pivotal study PARAMOUNT, 56 deaths occurred during induction treatment of which 11 were due 
to  study  drug-related  AE.  Among  the  15  death  due  to  unrelated  AE,  4  were  secondary  to  pulmonary 
embolism. Comparison of data from the PARAMOUNT and JMDB studies showed a higher toxicity in the 
Assessment report  
Page 25/29
 
 
 
   
 
JMDB study. Increased toxicity could be explained by a higher exposure to pemetrexed-cisplatin (up to 
6 cycles) during induction in JMDB in comparison to the PARAMOUNT induction treatment (4 cycles). 
However, no new safety signal emerged from the comparison of the PARAMOUNT induction treatment 
and JMDB. Overall, the safety results observed in the PARAMOUNT study are consistent with the known 
safety profile of pemetrexed.  
During  maintenance  treatment,  there  was  no  difference  between  placebo  and  pemetrexed  arms  in 
term of deaths. 
As expected, more patients in the pemetrexed arm had dose delays due to adverse events (20.1%) in 
comparison  to  the  placebo  arm  (14.4%).  The  most  common  reasons  for  dose  delays  in  active  arm 
were AEs related to haematotoxicity (anaemia, neutropenia, leucopenia, haemoglobin decreased). 
Similarly,  dose  reductions  were  more  frequent  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  (3.1%)  in  comparison  to  the 
placebo arm (0.6%). All the dose reductions were due to AEs.  
During maintenance treatment, frequencies of SAEs and related SAEs were higher in the pemetrexed 
arm.  However,  due  to  the  small  number  of  SAEs,  the  difference  between  both  arms  was  non-
significant.  Overall,  14  patients  (3.9%)  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and  3  (1.7%)  in  the  placebo  arm 
discontinued treatment due to SAEs.  
In  addition, pulmonary  embolism  (PE)  has  been  included  in  the  proposed  SmPC  as  a  newly identified 
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR).  
3.2.4.  Risk Management Plan 
The  MAH  considered  that  no  new  clinical  or  non-clinical  safety  concern  was  identified  in  the  pivotal 
PARAMOUNT  study,  hence  the  Risk  Management  Plan  does  not  require  to  be  updated  within  this 
application  and  the  current  Risk  Management  Plan  (Revision  4),  submitted  together  with  PSUR  9  in 
April 2011, is up-to-date. 
As  mentioned  immediately  above,  several  cases  of  pulmonary  embolism  have  been  reported  as 
Adverse  Drug  Reactions  in  the  PARAMOUNT  study,  among  which  4  led  to  death.  Until  now,  this  risk 
was  unexpected,  so  that  Pulmonary  Embolism  was  added  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  On  the  other 
hand,  pulmonary  embolism  is  not  addressed  in  the  current  version  4  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan, 
submitted together with PSUR 9 in April 2011. The Risk Management Plan will be updated accordingly 
at the next update in the first quarter of 2012. 
3.3.  Benefit-Risk balance 
Benefits 
  Beneficial effects 
The  present  application  for  extension  of  the  existing  Alimta  maintenance  indication  after  first  line 
treatment  of  NSCLC  is  mainly  based  on  the  PARAMOUNT  pivotal  study,  which  is  a  multicentre, 
randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  phase  III  study  designed  to  compare  maintenance 
therapy with pemetrexed plus BSC versus placebo plus BSC in terms of objective PFS time in patients 
with Stage IIIB or Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC whose disease has not progressed during 4 cycles of 
pemetrexed and cisplatin induction chemotherapy. 
This  trial  met  its  primary  objective,  as  the  analysis  showed  a  statistically  significant  (log  rank 
p=.00006)  increase  in  investigator-assessed  PFS  for  patients  treated  with  maintenance  pemetrexed. 
Assessment report  
Page 26/29
 
 
 
   
 
Median investigator-assessed PFS was 4.11 months (95% CI 3.15 to 4.57) in the pemetrexed arm and 
2.83 months (95% CI 2.60 to 3.12) in the placebo arm. 
The HR was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.49 to 0.79; Wald’s p=.00007) which represents a 38% reduction in the 
risk  of  disease  progression  for  patients  receiving  pemetrexed.    Independently  assessed  median  PFS 
following  induction  therapy  was  3.94  months  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and  2.6  months  in  the  placebo 
arm.  The  treatment  effect  was  statistically  significant  (HR  =  0.64;  95%  CI:  0.51  to  0.81;  Wald’s  p 
=.00025). 
A  clear  difference  in  PFS  could  be  observed  from  the  second  month  of  treatment.  This  difference 
remained  in  favour  of  the  pemetrexed  arm  up  to  11  months.  Although  results  are  consistent  in 
subgroups,  there  are  some  subgroups  for  which  the  95%  CI  of  HR  includes  1,  hence  no  difference 
could  be  confirmed  statistically  (see  figure  3).  However,  few  PFS  events  had  occurred  in  these 
subgroups thus leading to wide 95% CIs. 
Secondary  efficacy  results  showed  that  the  tumour  response  rate  of  the  maintenance  therapy  (CR  + 
PR) was 4.2% in the pemetrexed arm and 1.1% in the placebo arm (p=.067). 
Results  of  the  first  preliminary  survival  analysis  showed  a  preliminary  improvement  of  the  median  of 
1.57 months. Survival was immature with high censoring rates (78.6% and 74.4% for the pemetrexed 
and  placebo  arms,  respectively).  For  a  second  preliminary  analysis  of  OS  results,  299  events  had 
occurred with censoring rates of 48% and 38% in the pemetrexed and placebo arms, respectively. The 
hazard ratio was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.61 to 0.98; log rank p= 0.034). The median OS benefit for patients 
receiving pemetrexed was 2.76 months. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There are no significant uncertainties in the knowledge of the beneficial effects. 
Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
Fifty six (56) deaths occurred during induction treatment of which 11 were due to study drug-related 
AEs. Among the 15 death due to unrelated AEs, 4 were secondary to pulmonary embolism. Comparison 
of  data  from  the  PARAMOUNT  and  JMDB  studies  showed  a  higher  toxicity  during  JMDB.  Increased 
toxicity  could  be  explained  by  a  higher  exposure  to  pemetrexed-cisplatin  (up  to  6  cycles)  in 
comparison  to  PARAMOUNT  induction  treatment  (4  cycles).  However,  no  new  safety  signal  emerged 
from  the  comparison  of  the  PARAMOUNT  induction  treatment  and  JMDB.  Overall,  the  safety  results 
observed in the PARAMOUNT study are consistent with the known safety profile of pemetrexed.  
During  maintenance  treatment,  there  was  no  difference  between  placebo  and  pemetrexed  arms  in 
term  of  deaths.  As  expected  more  patients  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  had  dose  delays  due  to  adverse 
events (20.1%) in comparison to the placebo arm (14.4%). The most common reasons for dose delays 
in  active  arm  were  AEs  related  to  hematotoxicity  (anaemia,  neutropenia,  leukopenia,  haemoglobin 
decreased). Similarly dose reductions were more frequent in pemetrexed arm (3.1%) in comparison to 
the placebo arm (0.6%). All the dose reductions were due to AEs.  
During maintenance treatment, frequencies of SAEs and related SAEs were higher in the pemetrexed 
arm.  However,  due  to  the  small  number  of  SAEs,  the  difference  between  both  arms  was  non-
significant.  Overall,  14  patients  (3.9%)  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and  3  (1.7%)  in  the  placebo  arm, 
discontinued treatment due to SAEs.

  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Pulmonary  embolism  is  a  newly  identified  Adverse  Drug  Reaction  (ADR)  for  pemetrexed.  As  such,  it 
was  included  in  section  4.8  of  the SmPC  and  it  will  be  included  in  the  next  version  of  the  RMP  which 
the MAH proposes to submit in early 2012. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The  gain  in  median  PFS  of  1.38  months  was  highly  statistically  significant.  Based  on  preliminary 
analyses, a statistically significant difference in OS has not been shown, but the preliminary difference 
in median OS of 2.76 months suggests that at least a detrimental effect is unlikely. 
  Benefit-risk balance 
The  benefit-risk  balance  of  pemetrexed  as  maintenance  treatment  after  a  first  line  platinum-
pemetrexed combination is considered as positive, as the demonstrated statistically significant gain in 
PFS  outweighs  the  added  toxicity  of  pemetrexed  given  as  maintenance  treatment  after  induction 
chemotherapy with a platinum-pemetrexed combination. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  PARAMOUNT  study  added  a  new  piece  of  information  on  the  use  of  pemetrexed  as  maintenance 
treatment  of  NSCLC  other  than  predominantly  squamous  cell  histology  after  first  line  induction 
treatment  with  platinum  chemotherapy  that  included  pemetrexed.  Two  questions  resulting  from  the 
pemetrexed  maintenance treatment had been: 1)  whether the OS benefit observed in trial JMEN was 
only  due  to  the  delayed  administration  of  otherwise  efficacious  pemetrexed  and  2)  whether 
pemetrexed  maintenance  is  beneficial  (even)  after  pemetrexed  induction.  PARAMOUNT  showed  that 
patients  derive  additional  benefit  from  continuing  pemetrexed  as  maintenance  treatment  after 
induction chemotherapy which includes pemetrexed. 
Based on PARAMOUNT and earlier studies in both maintenance (JMEN) and first-line (JMDB) treatment, 
there  is  little  uncertainty  in  the  knowledge  of  favourable  and  unfavourable  effects  in  the  use  of 
pemetrexed  as  maintenance  treatment  after  a  first  line  platinum-pemetrexed  combination  to  change 
the benefit-risk balance. 
4.  Conclusion 
On 22 September 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet.

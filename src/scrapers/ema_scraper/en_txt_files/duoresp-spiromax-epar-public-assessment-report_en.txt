1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Teva  Pharma  B.V.  submitted  on  29  January  2013  an  application  for 
Marketing  Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines Agency  (EMA)  for  DuoResp  Spiromax, 
through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 May 
2010.  The  eligibility  to the  centralised  procedure  under  Article  3(2)(b)  of  Regulation  (EC) 
No 726/2004 was based on demonstration of interest of patients at Community level. 
The application concerns a hybrid medicinal product as defined in Article 10(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and refers to a reference product for which a Marketing Authorisation is or has 
been  granted  in  a  Member  State  on  the  basis  of  a  complete  dossier  in  accordance  with 
Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Asthma 
DuoResp  Spiromax  is  indicated  in  the  regular  treatment  of  asthma,  where  use  of  a 
combination  (inhaled  corticosteroid  and  long-acting  beta2-adrenoceptor  agonist)  is 
appropriate: 
- patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and “as needed”inhaled 
short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists. 
or 
-  patients  already  adequately  controlled  on  both  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  long-acting 
beta2-adrenoceptor agonists. 
COPD 
Symptomatic treatment of patients with severe COPD (FEV1 < 50% predicted normal) and 
a  history  of  repeated  exacerbations,  who  have  significant  symptoms  despite  regular 
therapy with long-acting bronchodilators.

Not applicable 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  141/2000  and  Article  3  of  Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the 
possible  similarity  with  authorised  orphan  medicinal  products  because  there  is  no 
authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
DuoResp Spiromax is an orally inhaled fixed-dose combination product containing the active 
substances  budesonide,  an  inhaled  glucocorticosteroid  with  anti-inflammatory  activity  in  the 
lungs,  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate,  a  selective  long-acting  inhaled  β2  adrenoceptor 
agonist. This combination of active substances is already approved at national level in several 
EU  countries.  This  well-known  combination  is  indicated  for  use  in  the  regular  treatment  of 
adults, adolescents and children six years of age and older with asthma where the use of the 
combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  an  inhaled long-acting β 2  adrenoceptor  agonist 
is  appropriate  (maintenance  and  reliever  therapy)  and  in  the  symptomatic  treatment  of 
adults with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 13/117 
 
  
  
The  fixed-dose  combination  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  has  been  shown  to 
provide  greater  improvement  in  pulmonary  function  and  overall  asthma  control  than  either 
drug  administered  alone  and  its  use  does  not  result  in  any  untoward  interaction  that  might 
affect the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic or safety profiles of the individual drugs.  
Budesonide  is  an  orally  inhaled  glucocorticosteroid  with  high  local  anti-inflammatory  activity 
and  a  lower  incidence  of  adverse  effects  than  is  seen  with  oral  corticosteroids.  Budesonide 
has  been  shown  to  decrease  airways  reactivity  to  histamine  and  methacholine  in  patients 
with hyper reactive airways. Inhaled budesonide is recommended for use in the management 
of patients with asthma.  
Formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  is  a  selective  long-acting  β 2  adrenergic  agonist  and  exerts  a 
preferential  effect  on  β 2  adrenergic  receptors  on  bronchial  smooth  muscle  to  produce 
relaxation  and  bronchodilatation.  Formoterol  is  used  via  the  orally  inhaled  route  in  the 
management  of  patients  with  reversible  airways  obstruction.  Formoterol  produces 
bronchodilatation within 1-3 minutes following inhalation, bronchodilatation which lasts for 12 
hours  following  a  single  dose.  Formoterol  is  particularly  useful  in  patients  with  reversible 
airways  obstruction  who  continue  to  experience  symptoms  despite  treatment  with  an  anti-
inflammatory  agent  such  as  an  inhaled  corticosteroid.  Guidelines  for  the  management  of 
reversible  airways  obstruction  and  particularly  asthma  recommend  the  addition  of  a  long-
acting β 2 agonist to the treatment regimen in these patients and studies have shown that the 
addition  of  a  long-acting  β 2  agonist  provides  better  control  of  asthma  than  increasing  the 
dose of inhaled corticosteroid. 
The  mechanisms  of  action  of  the  two  drugs,  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate 
are different but complementary. Budesonide and formoterol fumarate demonstrate additive 
effects. 
The  clinical  pharmacology  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  has  been  investigated 
extensively  in  the  past,  is  well  known  and  has  been  the  subject  of  many  publications.  The 
Applicant  has  not  presented  a  review  of  the  literature  with  regard  to  the  pharmacokinetics 
(and pharmacodynamics) of budesonide and formoterol fumarate but cites relevant literature 
as required and as appropriate. 
The  Applicant  has  submitted  an  application  through  the  Centralised  Procedure  for  an  orally 
inhaled fixed-dose combination product in three strengths formulated as an inhalation powder 
and  administered  via  a  novel  inhalation-driven,  multi-dose  dry  powder  inhaler  (DPI)  device 
known as the Spiromax Inhaler: 
-  DuoResp Spiromax 80/4.5 µg per dose, inhalation powder 
-  DuoResp Spiromax 160/4.5 µg per dose, inhalation powder and 
-  DuoResp Spiromax 320/9 µg per dose, inhalation powder 
The  proposed  indication  is  in  the  regular  treatment  of  adults  and  adolescents  with  asthma 
where the use of the combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and an inhaled long-acting β 2 
adrenoceptor agonist is appropriate and in the symptomatic treatment of adults with severe 
chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease.  Budesonide  and  formoterol  are  well-known  active 
substances and a fixed dose combination of budesonide and formoterol has well-documented 
and demonstrated positive benefit-risk in the claimed indications.  
This application has been submitted in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC Article 10(3) – 
hybrid  application  –  application  for  a  medicinal  product  referring  to  a  so-called  reference

2001. 
The  development  of  DuoResp  Spiromax 
follows 
the  CHMP  Guideline  on  OIPs 
(CPMP/EWP/4151/00  Rev.  1)  and  aims  to  demonstrate  therapeutic  equivalence  of  this  new 
product  to  the  reference  product.  The  development  is  based  on  the  demonstration  of 
pharmacokinetic  equivalence  between  each  strength  of  this  fixed-dose  combination,  BF 
Spiromax1  and  the  corresponding  strength  of  the  reference  product,  Symbicort  Turbohaler. 
One  pharmacodynamic  study  and  one  safety  study  has  been  carried  out,  but  no  Phase  3 
clinical  efficacy  or  safety  studies  have  been  conducted  comparing  the  test  and  reference 
products in adults or adolescents.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
DuoResp  Spiromax  is  a  fixed-dose  combination  product  presented  as  dry  powder  for  oral 
inhalation  containing  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate.  Three  strengths  were 
initially  proposed:  budesonide  80  µg  and  formoterol  (as  fumarate  dihydrate)  4.5  µg, 
budesonide 160 µg and formoterol (as fumarate dihydrate) 4.5 µg and budesonide 320 µg 
and formoterol (as fumarate dihydrate) 9 µg. During the procedure, the lowest strength was 
withdrawn since neither in vitro equivalence, nor bioequivalence with the originator product 
was  demonstrated.  The  only  other  ingredient  is  lactose  monohydrate.  The  product  is 
administered  via  a  novel  inhalation-driven  multi-dose  dry  powder  inhaler  (DPI)  with  active 
dose metering known as the Spiromax inhaler. Each inhaler contains either 60 doses (high 
strength) or 120 doses (middle strength) and is foil-wrapped. 
1 BF Spiromax – The Applicant refers to this fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate as BF 
Spiromax.     The CHMP uses the same term in order to avoid confusion across documents.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The finished product contains two known active substances, formoterol fumarate dihydrate 
(a  long-acting  β 2  agonist),  and  budesonide  (a  corticosteroid  anti-inflammatory),  which  are 
described  in  Ph.  Eur.  As  there  are  monographs  for  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate 
dihydrate in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturers of the active substances have 
been  granted  Certificates  of  Suitability  of  the  European  Pharmacopoeia  (CEP)  which  have 
been  provided  within  the  current  Marketing  Authorisation  Application.  The  information 
provided  regarding  the  manufacturing  processes  and  the  control  of  the  active  substances 
was  assessed  and  approved  by  the  European  Directorate  for  the  Quality  of  Medicines. 
Satisfactory  quality  of  the  active  substances  is  ensured  through  the  CEPs.  Budesonide  is 
supplied  by  a  single  manufacturer  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  is  supplied  by  a 
further  manufacturer.  Both  active  substances  are  micronized  by  a  separate  manufacturer 
before formulation. 
Budesonide 
Budesonide is a corticosteroid designated chemically as a mixture of the C*-22S (epimer A) 
and  the  C*-22R  (epimer  B)  epimers  of  16α,17-[(1RS)-butylidenebis(oxy)]-11β,21-
dihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione.  The  active  ingredient  budesonide  has  nine  chiral 
centres. Budesonide is a white to almost white crystalline powder that is practically insoluble 
in water, sparingly soluble in ethanol, and freely soluble in dichloromethane. 
The chemical structure of budesonide is: 
The release specifications include tests for residual solvents and particle size distribution in 
addition  to  all  controls  specified  in  the  Ph.  Eur.  monograph.  The  specifications  comprise 
tests  for  appearance  (Ph.  Eur.),  solubility  (Ph.  Eur.),  identification  (Ph.  Eur.),  related 
substances  (Ph.  Eur.),  epimer  A  (Ph.  Eur.),  loss  on  drying  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (Ph.  Eur.), 
residual  solvents  (CEP)  and  particle  size  (laser  diffraction).  The  method  used  for 
quantification  of  methanol  is  described  in  Annex  I  of  the  CEP  and  no  validation  data  is 
presented  since  it  was  already  assessed  by  EDQM.  The  laser  diffraction  method  has  been 
adequately described and validated. The particle size distribution is crucial to achieving the 
required delivered dose and lung deposition characteristics. 
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  and  the  in-process  controls 
are considered adequate. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, 
starting  materials  and  reagents  have  been  assessed  by  the  EDQM  before  issuing  the 
Certificate of Suitability. Analytical data demonstrating compliance with the drug substance 
specification have been provided for 3 batches of budesonide. 
Budesonide  is  packaged  in  a  double  layer  of  polyethylene  bags,  then  stored  in  either  fibre 
drums or Moplen containers.

Stability  data  on  10  pilot  and  commercial  scale  batches  of  budesonide  from  the  proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 60 months under long 
term  conditions  (25  ºC  / 60%  RH)  and  on 7  pilot  and  commercial  scale  batches  stored  for 
up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH 
guidelines were provided. The following parameters were tested: appearance, identity, loss 
on  drying,  assay,  purity,  related  substances,  epimer  A  content  and  microbial  quality.  The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release, except for microbiological testing and 
particle  size.  Both  methods  have  been  validated.  No  trends  were  observed  and  all  results 
comply with the current specifications. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed 
supplier  is  sufficiently  stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  in  the 
proposed  container.  The  applicant  commits  to  placing  1  batch  of  budesonide  on  long-term 
stability on an annual basis as per ICH guidelines. 
Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate 
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate is 2:1 salt of formoterol and fumaric acid associated with 2 
molecules of water. It is a selective and long-acting β 2 adrenergic receptor agonist and has 
2  chiral  centres.  It’s  chemical  name  is  N-[2-Hydroxy-5-[(1RS)-1-hydroxy-2-[[(1RS)-2-(4-
methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]formamide  (E)-butenedioate  dihydrate. 
Formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  is  a  white  to  almost  white  or  slightly  yellow  crystalline 
powder  that  is  slightly  soluble  in  water,  soluble  in  methanol,  slightly  soluble  in  2-propanol 
and practically insoluble in acetonitrile. 
The chemical structure of formoterol fumarate dihydrate is: 
The release specifications include tests for residual solvents (methanol and 2-propanol) and 
particle size distribution in addition to all controls specified in the Ph. Eur. monograph. The 
specifications  comprise  tests  for  appearance  (Ph.  Eur.),  identification  (Ph.  Eur.),  pH  (Ph. 
Eur.), optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), impurity I (Ph. Eur.), water 
(Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (CEP) and particle size (laser diffraction). The method used for 
quantification of methanol and 2-propanol is described in the CEP and no validation data is 
presented  since  it  was  already  assessed  by  EDQM.  The  laser  diffraction  method  has  been 
adequately described and validated. The particle size distribution is crucial to achieving the 
required delivered dose and lung deposition characteristics. 
The characterisation of formoterol fumarate dihydrate and its impurities and the in-process 
controls  are  considered  adequate.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for  intermediate

products,  starting  materials  and  reagents  have  been  assessed  by  the  EDQM  before  issuing 
the  Certificate  of  Suitability.  Analytical  data  demonstrating  compliance  with  the  drug 
substance specification have been provided for 3 batches of formoterol fumarate dihydrate. 
Formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  is  packaged  in  an  amber  borosilicate  glass  bottle  inside  a 
thermally welded polyester/aluminium/polyester/polypropylene (PAPP) bag. 
Stability  data  on  3  production  scale  batches  of  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  from  the 
proposed  manufacturer  stored  in  the  intended  commercial  packaging  for  up  to  60  months 
and  a  further  3  production  scale  batches  for  up  to  40  months  under  long  term  conditions 
(25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  on  6  production  scale  batches  stored  for  up  to  6  months  under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  identity,  water,  assay,  related  substances, 
impurity I, particle size, degree of crystallinity and microbial quality. The analytical methods 
used  were  the  same  as  for  release,  except  for  microbiological  testing  and  degree  of 
crystallinity.  Both  methods  have  been  validated.  No  trends  were  observed  and  all  results 
comply with the current specifications. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier 
is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed 
container.  The  applicant  commits  to  placing  1  batch  of  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  on 
long-term stability on an annual basis as per ICH guidelines. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  objective  was  to  develop  a  dry  powder  for  inhalation  containing  a  fixed  dose 
combination  of  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate,  a  selective  and  long  acting  β 2-agonist 
bronchodilator,  and  budesonide,  a  corticosteroid  anti-inflammatory,  to  treat  the  symptoms 
of asthma and COPD. The product is to be delivered via the Spiromax inhaler, an inhalation-
driven multi-dose dry powder delivery device. The product is designed to have an equivalent 
performance  to  the  reference  product,  Symbicort  Turbohaler.  As  such,  DuoResp  Spiromax 
has  been  developed  following  the  EMA  “Guideline  on  the  requirements  for  clinical 
documentation  for  orally  inhaled  products  including  the  requirements  for  demonstration  of 
therapeutic  equivalence  between  two  inhaled  products  for  use  in  the  treatment  of  asthma 
and  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  in  adults  and  for  the  use  in  the  treatment  of 
asthma  in  children  and  adolescents”  (CPMP/EWP/4151/00  Rev.  1).  Akin  to  the  reference 
product, the formulation is a simple combination of the two active substances and lactose. 
The  principles  of  Quality  by  Design  were  applied  to  the  pharmaceutical  development, 
although  no  design  space  was  applied  for  and  manufacture  and  validation  are  carried  out 
classically. The applicant defined key parameters of the reference product (flow resistance, 
uniformity  of  delivered  dose  (UDD)  and  aerodynamic  particle  size  distribution  (APSD). 
Pharmacokinetic  studies  were  carried  out  to  establish  relationships  between  these 
parameters  and  the  in  vivo  performance  (bioequivalence)  of  each  active  substance.  A 
quality target product profile (QTPP) was then defined for DuoResp Spiromax as follows: it 
should  closely  match  the  quality  profile  of  Symbicort  Turbohaler;  it  should  produce 
equivalent  lung  deposition  and  total  systemic  exposure  to  Symbicort  Turbohaler  as 
demonstrated  by  equivalent  in  vivo  PK  performance;  it  should  meet  the  quality 
requirements  as  per  EMA  Guidance  “Guideline  on  the  Pharmaceutical  Quality  of  Inhalation

and  Nasal  Products”  (CHMP/QWP/49313/2005  Corr),  as  well  as  other  relevant  quality 
guidelines. 
Flow resistance and dependence, UDD, and APSD were defined as critical quality attributes 
(CQAs). Critical material attributes (CMAs) are particle size distribution (PSD) including fine 
particle  dose  (FPD)  of  both  active  substances  and  lactose  and  critical  process  parameters 
are  mixing  time  and  speed  during  blending.  The  relationship  between  APSD  and  lung 
deposition was determined and used to guide development. Limits for the various CQAs and 
CPPs  required  to  ensure  the  desired  APSD  were  established  using  Design  of  Experiments 
methodology (DoE). In addition, critical device attributes (CDAs) were compared with those 
of the reference product to ensure equivalent performance of the inhaler. 
A  series  of  trial  formulations  using  micronized  budesonide,  micronized  formoterol,  and 
lactose  of  varying  PSD  were  manufactured  and  their  performance  evaluated,  first  in  vitro, 
and  then  by  PK  studies  in  vivo.  Once  the  final  formulation  had  been  decided,  a  further 
pivotal  in  vivo  PK  study  was  carried  out  on  the  medium  and  high  strength  products  to 
demonstrate bioequivalence to Symbicort. Bioequivalence was not demonstrated for the low 
strength product which is therefore not authorised for marketing at this time. 
Lactose is a well-known pharmaceutical ingredient and its quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards.  Its  compatibility  with  the  active  substances  is  already  known  from  experience 
with  the  innovator  product.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The primary packaging is a white inhaler with a translucent wine red mouthpiece cap.  The 
inhaler  is  made  of  different  plastic  materials;  acrylonitrile  butadiene  styrene  (ABS), 
polyethylene  terephthalate  (PET),  and  polypropylene  (PP).  Each  inhaler  contains  either  60 
doses  (high  strength)  or  120  doses  (middle  strength)  and  is  foil-wrapped.  The  materials 
comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
It  is  confirmed  that  the  lactose  is  produced  from  milk  from  healthy  animals  in  the  same 
condition  as  those  used  to  collect  milk  for  human  consumption  and  that  the  lactose  has 
been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the 
Note 
for  Guidance  on  Minimising 
the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform 
Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products. 
Manufacture of the product 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  4  main  steps:  blending  of  the  2  micronized  active 
substances with pre-sieved lactose monohydrate; filling of the homogeneous powder blend 
into the device sub-assembly, followed by assembly of the entire device; equilibration of the 
filled  device;  packaging  and  labelling.  The  manufacturing  process  is  considered  to  be  non-
standard. 
Controls  are  applied  to  critical  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  as  follows:  blend 
homogeneity  testing  by  NGI  on  multiple  samples  to  ensure  adequate  blending; 
measurement  of  net  powder  weight  in  each  device  to  ensure  correct  fill  weight;  check  to 
ensure each device is assembled correctly; actuation check on each device to ensure correct 
functionality; dose counter check; leak testing to ensure foil pouch seal integrity.

Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  according  to  the  Note  for 
Guidance on Process Validation (CPMP/QWP/848/96) and Annex II to Note for Guidance on 
Process  Validation  –  Non-standard  Processes  (CPMP/QWP/2054/03).  Validation  data  was 
provided  for  three  batches  each  of  the  middle  and  high  strength  products  manufactured 
according  to  the  registered  process  description.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  the  production  of  this  dry 
powder inhaler. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  for  each  strength  include  appropriate  tests  for 
this kind of dosage form including appearance of powder (visual description), appearance of 
inhaler (visual inspection), identification (HPLC, UV), related substances (HPLC), formoterol 
impurity  I  (HPLC),  assay  of  inhaler  content  (HPLC)  moisture  content  (KF),  microbiological 
contamination (Ph.  Eur.),  uniformity of delivered dose (Ph.  Eur.), aerodynamic assessment 
of fine particles (Ph. Eur.) and number of actuations per device (visual inspection). 
Batch analysis results provided for 6 commercial scale batches of high (320/9 µg) strength 
product,  along  with  3  commercial  scale  batches  of  the  medium  (160/4.5  µg)  strength 
product confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture 
to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  3  commercial  scale  batches  each  of  the  medium  and  high  strengths  of 
finished product stored under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 18 months 
and under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 6 months according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of DuoResp Spiromax are identical to those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
In  addition,  in-use  stability  was  tested  using  unwrapped  samples  stored  under  long  term 
conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  for  up  to  6  months.  An  in-use  shelf-life  of  6  months  when 
stored below 25 oC is granted. 
Samples were tested according to the release specifications except that slightly wider limits 
are  allowed  for  aerodynamic  assessment  of  fine  particles  and  assay  of  inhaler  content.  No 
relevant  change  or  trend  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters  was  observed  under  either 
condition. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The applicant will complete 
the on-going stability studies on pivotal batches up to the proposed shelf-life. In addition, a 
commitment is made to place a further production batch of each strength on stability as per 
GMP requirements. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 20/117 
 
  
  
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in 
turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform 
performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions  defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the 
uniform  clinical  performance  of  the product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a 
satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant has not conducted or sponsored any non-clinical studies using budesonide and 
formoterol  to  support  this  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  as  the  pharmacological  and 
toxicological  effects  of  both  budesonide  and  formoterol  are  documented  in  the  published 
literature.    The  Applicant  has  chosen  to  rely  on  the  literature  on  the  non-clinical 
characterisation of budesonide and formoterol and their known clinical properties.   
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Budesonide 
In vitro: Budesonide is a glucocorticoid with high affinity for specific glucocorticoid receptors 
that  were  characterised  by  interaction  with  cortisol.  When  administered  systemically, 
budesonide bound to these receptors with an affinity approximately 200 times that of cortisol 
and  was  shown  to  have  a  1000-fold  greater  topical  anti-inflammatory  activity  than  cortisol 
(Dollery, 1999; Clissold, 1984; Szefler, 1999). Budesonide was shown to have a high ratio of 
topical  to  systemic  activity  when  compared  to  other  corticosteroids  (e.g.  beclomethasone, 
fluocinolone  and  triamcinolone).  This  high  ratio  is  due  to  the  16,  17-acetal  side  chain  of 
budesonide.  Inhaled  budesonide  was  shown  to  rapidly  induce  pulmonary  vasoconstriction, 
suggesting a nongenomic mechanism probably related to the disposition of noradrenaline at 
the neuromuscular junction. In an isolated and perfused rat lung model, vasoconstriction was 
more  pronounced  after  inhalation  of  10  to  50  μg  budesonide  than  a  lower  dose  of  2 μg 
(Ewing, 2010).  
Budesonide was shown to inhibit the adhesion of neutrophils and monocyte/macrophages to 
the  capillary  endothelial  cells  in  inflamed  tissue,  block  the  effect  of  macrophage  migration

inhibitory  factor  and  inhibit  phospholipase  A2  activity,  thereby  reducing  the  formation  of 
prostaglandins and leukotrienes in the local tissue.  
Inhaled budesonide was also shown to reduce the indices of eosinophil activation in asthma. 
These  effects  were  considered  a  likely  result  of  the  inhibition  of  transcription  of  several 
cytokines that are overexpressed in asthma, in particular the interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4 and IL-5 
and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), especially from activated T 
cells. Glucocorticoids are known to inhibit plasma exudation through the endothelial barrier of 
the bronchial vasculature and therefore reduce airway oedema (Dollery, 1999). 
In vivo: In early studies in rats, budesonide administered intratracheally or by inhalation was 
found  to  counteract  the  pathophysiological  changes  (bronchial  and  interstitial  infiltration  of 
eosinophils  and  mononuclear  cells)  associated  with  the  intratracheal  administration  of 
Sephadex beads (Clissold, 1984). 
In a model of late allergic reaction of the lower airways of minipigs sensitised to Ascaris suum 
(roundworms),  animals  were  administered  topical or  intravenous  doses  of  10.2  and  5 μg/kg 
budesonide,  respectively.  Inhalation  of  budesonide  1  hour  prior  to  challenge  altered  the 
airway reactions and mediator release observed after challenge (Fornhem, 1996). 
In dogs, pre-treated with inhalation doses of 2.7 mg/day budnesonide for 7 days, significant 
reductions  in  eosinophils in  bronchiolar  lavage  were  associated  with  a  reduction  in  allergen-
induced airway hyperresponsiveness (Woolley, 1994a).  
Inhibition  of  induced  plasma  extravasation  in  the  nasal  mucosa  of  rats  has  been  reported. 
Intra-nasal  doses  of  0.1  to  50  μg  budesonide,  twice  daily  for  2  days,  resulted  in  a 
dose-dependent inhibition of capsaicin-induced extravasation in the nasal cavity. 
Like  other  corticosteroids,  budesonide  was  ineffective  at  resolving  established  sustained 
airway  hyperresponsiveness,  even  though  they  were  shown  to  be  effective  at  reducing 
inflammation-associated 
airway 
hyperresponsiveness 
and 
sustained 
airway 
hyperresponsiveness  when  administered  continuously  prior  to  the  development  of  airway 
dysfunction (Southam, 2008).  
There is evidence that circulating inflammatory cell progenitors may contribute to the airway 
inflammation  seen  in  asthma.  The  effect  of  allergen  inhalation  on  bone  marrow  progenitor 
cell  production  was  investigated  in  dogs  with  allergen-induced  airway  hyperresponsiveness. 
The  inhalation  of  approximately  100  μg/kg/day  budesonide  for  7  days  significantly  reduced 
the number of bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (Woolley, 1994). 
Unlike  the  glucocorticoids  beclomethasone  and  fluticasone,  budesonide  conjugates  with 
intracellular fatty acids in airway and lung tissue to form lipophilic esters which are unable to 
bind  to  the  glucocorticoid  receptor.  In  studies  in  rats  administered  10-8  to  10-5  M  [3H]-
budesonide  into  the  airways,  70 to 80%  of  budesonide  retained  in  the  airways  was 
conjugated  by  20 minutes  post  dose.  The  fatty  acid  conjugation  was  reversible  and  the 
conjugates slowly hydrolysed to free budesonide. It was suggested that the prolonged airway 
retention  of  budesonide,  as  a  result  of  this  conjugation  and  subsequent  slow  release, 
contributes  to  the  relatively  long  duration  of  its  local  anti-inflammatory  activity  (Miller-
Larsson, 1998). 
Formoterol 
In vitro: In vitro studies have shown that formoterol has more than 200-fold greater agonist 
activity at ß2-receptors than at ß1-receptors.

In  [125I]iodocyanopindolol-labeled  bronchial  membranes,  formoterol  and  salmeterol  (a  β2-
adrenergic  receptor  agonist)  induced  high-affinity  states  of  the  ß2-receptor,  the  former 
inducing a higher percentage (57 versus 28). Formoterol and salmeterol were highly selective 
for the ß2- versus ß1-subtype (pKi values were 8.2 and 6.25, and 8.3 and 5.7, respectively). 
Albuterol  (a  β2-adrenergic  receptor  agonist)  and  fenoterol  (a  β2-adrenergic  agonist)  were 
less  selective  for  the  ß2-  versus  ß1-subtype  (pKl  values  were  5.83  and  4.71,  and  6.33  and 
5.67, respectively; Roux, 1996).  
Increased  cAMP  levels  caused  the  relaxation  of  bronchial  smooth  muscle  and  inhibited  the 
release  of  mediators  of  immediate  hypersensitivity  from  cells,  especially  mast  cells.  In  vitro 
tests  showed  that  formoterol  is  an  inhibitor  of  the  release  of  mast  cell  mediators,  such  as 
histamine and leukotrienes, from human lung tissue. The relevance of these in vitro findings 
to humans is unknown (PDR, 2012). 
Results  of  an  in  vitro  study  indicated  that  the  increased  lipophilicity  of  the  long  acting  ß2-
agonists, including formoterol, was associated with binding in the smooth muscle membrane 
adjacent to the ß-receptor (Faulds, 1991). 
In in vitro studies, using  both animal and human  muscle preparations, formoterol showed a 
greater  pharmacological  maximal  effect  than  salmeterol.  Results  from  severely  constricted 
bronchial  smooth  muscle  preparation  indicated  that  salmeterol  was  a  partial  agonist  of  the 
β2-receptor  in  relation  to formoterol.  Formoterol  was  shown  to  have  a  rapid  onset  of  action 
and high intrinsic activity (Lötvall, 2002).  
Ex  vivo:  Inhaled  formoterol  is  known  to  act  locally  in  the  lung  as  a  bronchodilator.  The 
biological  activities  of  salmeterol  and  formoterol  on  isolated  guinea  pig  tracheal  spirals  and 
their receptor binding to guinea pig bronchial and ventricular membranes were characterised. 
The long-acting -β2-agonists salmeterol and formoterol, were equipotent in relaxing 100 μM 
histamine-induced  maximally  contracted  guinea  pig  tracheal  spirals.  Both  agonists  were  10 
times  more  potent  than  L-isoproterenol  (a  β1  and  β2-adrenergic  agonist)  and  fenoterol  and 
100  times  more  potent  than  albuterol.  A  comparison  was  also  made  of  the  relaxation 
achieved with 200 µM aminophylline (a bronchodilator). L-isoproterenol and fenoterol induced 
>90% relaxation (percentage of maximal aminophylline relaxation). Formoterol and albuterol 
were  equally  efficacious.  Formoterol  was  more  efficacious  (86%)  than  salmeterol  (62%)  or 
the  bronchodilator  soterenol  (59%).  In  10 μM  histamine-induced  minimally  contracted 
tissues, all agonist potencies increased 10-fold and complete relaxation was achieved (Roux, 
1996).  
In  vivo:  A  series  of  experiments  were  conducted  to  investigate  whether  the  anti-plasma 
leakage action of ß2-adrenoceptor agonists in rat airways was subject to tolerance. Rats were 
pretreated  with  intraperitoneal  doses  of  0.1,  1  or  10  μg/kg  formoterol  for  7  days;  and  24 
hours  later  the  effectiveness  of  a  single  intravenous  dose  of  up  to  10  μg/kg  formoterol  was 
tested  against  substance  P-induced  plasma  leakage.  The  anti-leakage  effect  of  formoterol 
was  not  subject  to  tolerance  with  the  low  or  intermediate  pretreatment  dose.  Pretreatment 
with 10 μg/kg formoterol reduced the effectiveness of the 1 μg/kg acute dose but not the 10 
μg/kg  acute  dose.  These  results  suggested  that  tolerance  to  the  anti-leakage  effect  of 
formoterol could occur with repeated higher doses (Bowden, 1997). 
The effects of formoterol on rat and guinea pig hypersensitivity reactions and on mouse IgE 
antibody  formation  were  investigated.  The  inhibitory  effect  of  intravenously  and  orally 
administered  formoterol  on  (mouse)  IgE-mediated  24-hour  passive  cutaneous  anaphylaxis 
(PCA)  in  rats  was  6.3  and  33  times,  respectively,  more  potent  than  that  of  salbutamol  (a 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 23/117 
 
  
  
short-acting  β2-adrenergic  receptor  agonist).  This  action  was  antagonised  by  pretreatment 
with  propranolol  (a  sympatholytic  non-selective  β  blocker).  The  dose  of  formoterol  which 
inhibited  PCA  had  no  effect  on  histamine-  and  5-hydroxytryptamine  (5HT)-induced  skin 
reactions.  Formoterol,  administered  intravenously  or  orally,  inhibited  (guinea  pig)  IgE-
mediated  8-day  PCA  in  guinea  pigs.  In  the  isolated  guinea  pig  lung,  both  formoterol  and 
salbutamol  exhibited  dose-dependent  inhibition  of  antigen-induced  histamine  release. 
However,  in  the  isolated  rat  mesenterium  these  two  drugs  showed  only  partial  inhibition  of 
antigen-induced  mast  cell  degranulation.  Neither  formoterol  nor  salbutamol  affected  the 
hapten-specific IgE antibody response in female mice (Tomioka, 1981). 
Formoterol  was  also  shown  to  inhibit  histamine-induced  plasma  albumin  extravasation  in 
anaesthetised  guinea  pigs  and  allergen-induced  eosinophil  influx  in  dogs  with  airway 
hyperresponsiveness. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown (PDR, 2012). 
Combination studies 
The  exact  mechanisms  for  the  enhanced  efficacy  of  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  long  acting 
β2-agonist  combinations  are  still  under  investigation  but  likely  include  interactions  at  the 
receptor  level  and  interwoven  signalling  pathways.  Data  from  preclinical  studies  provided 
evidence  of  additive,  compensatory,  complementary  and  synergistic  effects  of  inhaled 
corticosteroids  and  long  acting  β2-agonist  in  the  control  of  inflammation,  airway  and  lung 
remodelling. These effects were considered to contribute to the improved efficacy seen when 
treating  asthma  and  COPD  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  long  acting  β2-agonist 
combinations in clinical studies (Miller-Larsson, 2006). 
The  anti-inflammatory,  anti-remodeling  and  anti-bronchoconstriction  effects  of  budesonide 
and  formoterol  when  used  in  combination  include  the  inhibition  of  the  following  activities: 
granulocyte  macrophage-colony  stimulating  factor  (GM-CSF)  release  in  human  bronchial 
epithelial  cells,  expression  of  intercellular  adhesion  molecule-1  (ICAM-1)  and  vascular  cell 
adhesion  molecule-1  (VCAM-1)  in  human  lung  fibroblasts,  oxidative  burst  in  human 
eosinophils stimulated by bronchial epithelial cell-derived conditioned medium, inflammation-
induced  lung  oedema,  proliferation  of  airway  smooth  muscle  cells,  production  of 
proteoglycans by lung fibroblasts and the bronchoconstriction response to provocation. These 
effects  provide  evidence  that  the  combination  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  delivers  a 
greater benefit compared to either drug administered alone (FDA, 2006). 
Furthermore,  formoterol,  when  added  to  budesonide  in  human  lung  fibroblasts  exerted  an 
additive effect of the inhibition of IL-1β (Sharafkhaneh, 2002).  
In mouse tracheal smooth muscle, β2-receptors mRNA was not affected by cytokines (IL-1 β 
at  10 ng/mL)  but  increased  with  budesonide  (1  μM)  exposure.  However,  the  cytokines 
markedly  increased  cyclooxygenase  (COX)-2  mRNA  expression,  which  may  lead  to 
heterologous  desensitisation  of  β2-receptors.  The  cytokine-induced  increase  of  COX-2  was 
blocked by concomitant budesonide. This suggested that heterologous desensitisation of β2-
receptors  by  cytokines  may  be  prevented  by  budesonide  treatment.  Budesonide  also 
prevented  cytokine-induced  impairment  of  tracheal  relaxation  and  β2-receptors/cAMP 
signaling  for  formoterol  but  not  salmeterol.  These  results  suggested  that  differences  exist 
between  formoterol  and  salmeterol  in  β2-receptors  coupling/activation  and/or  signal 
transduction  upstream  of  cAMP.  They  also  implied  that  maximal  bronchodilator  effects  of 
formoterol,  but  not  salmeterol,  are  maintained  by  budesonide  treatment  during  periods  of 
increased inflammation, such as asthma exacerbations (Adner, 2010).

IL-6 is produced in response to inflammatory stress, and regulates the expression of acute-
phase  proteins  such  as  C-reactive  protein  and  plasma  fibrinogen.  In  clinical  studies,  serum 
IL-6 was consistently linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In a study using 
a  mouse  model  of  lung  injury,  a  single  pretreatment  with  budesonide  and  formoterol 
combined  reduced  IL  translocation  and  the  systemic  increase  of  IL-6  expression  and 
prevented the endothelial and cardiac dysfunction related to lipopolysaccharide-induced acute 
lung injury (Suda, 2011). 
A study was conducted to investigate the effect of inhaled corticosteroids and long acting β2-
agonist  combination  therapy  on  the  immune-inflammatory,  structural,  and  physiological 
processes  associated  with  chronic  aeroallergen  (house  dust  mite)  exposure.  The  effect  of 
budesonide  and/or  formoterol  treatment  with  allergen  avoidance  was  investigated  in  a 
murine model of sustained eosinophil inflammation and airway remodeling. It was shown that 
a  budesonide/formoterol  combination  therapy  suppressed  established  airway  inflammation, 
goblet  cell  hyperplasia  and  subepithelial  anti-α-smooth  muscle  actin  expression,  even  with 
ongoing allergen exposure (Johnson, 2008). 
In  rats  administered  salmeterol  (route  of  administration  not  specified)  for  1  week,  down 
regulation  of  pulmonary  β2-receptors  density  (by  up  to  70%)  and  desensitisation  of  β 
receptors  activity  were  observed.  However,  the  addition  of  corticosteroids  attenuated  this 
effect. Dexamethasone increased the number and rate of synthesis of β2-receptors in human 
lung  tissue  by  increasing  the  transcription  of  β  receptors  gene.  Similar  results  were  found 
when  hamster  smooth  muscle  cells  were  treated  with  corticosteroid  (triamcinolone 
acetonide). In some studies, the effective doses of budesonide and formoterol when used in 
combination were much lower than required when used individually (Sharafkhaneh, 2002). 
In asthma and COPD, activation of Gq-protein-coupled receptors causes bronchoconstriction. 
The  management  of  moderate-to-severe  disease  uses  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  long  acting 
β2-agonist combination therapies, which are more efficacious than either monotherapy alone.  
In  primary  human  airway  smooth  muscle  cells,  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  long  acting 
β2-agonist  combinations  synergistically  induced  the expression  of  the  regulator  of  G-protein 
signalling  2  (RGS2).  Functionally,  RGS2  reduced  intracellular  free  calcium  flux  elicited  by 
histamine, methacholine, leukotrienes and other spasmogens. Protection against spasmogen-
increased  intracellular  free  calcium,  following  treatment  for  6  hours  with  long  acting 
β2-agonist  plus  corticosteroid,  was  dependent  on  RGS2.  RGS2-deficient  mice  revealed 
enhanced  broncho-constriction  to  spasmogens  and  an  absence  of  long  acting  β2-agonist  -
induced broncho-protection (Holden, 2011). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Racemic  formoterol  is  an  equimolar  mixture  of  (R,R)-  and  (S,S)-formoterol.  Several  studies 
have  shown  (S,S)-  formoterol  to  have  proinflammatory  effects.    It  was  hypothesised  that 
(S,S)-formoterol  promoted  asthma  by  enhancing  IL-4  production  in  mast  cells  of  the 
asthmatic  airway.  To  investigate  this,  murine  and  human  mast  cells  were  pretreated  with 
either  (R,R)-  or  (S,S)-formoterol  and  then  stimulated  by  high  affinity  IgE  receptor  cross-
linking  or  with  phorbol  myristate  acetate  (PMA;  an  activator  of  protein  kinase C)/A23187  (a 
calcium  ionophore).  In  addition,  T  cells  were  stimulated  with  only  PMA.  (S,S)-formoterol 
enhanced  the  production  of  IL-4,  histamine  and  prostaglandin  D2  (PGD2)  in  mast  cells, 
whereas (R,R)-formoterol had no effect. Neither (S,S)- nor (R,R)-formoterol had an effect on 
IL-4 production in T cells.

Ovalbumin  (OVA)-sensitised  mice  were  pretreated  with  (R,R)-  or  (S,S)-formoterol  before 
each  daily  intranasal  OVA  challenge  for  10  days.  (S,S)-formoterol  increased  IL-4  secretion, 
whereas  (R,R)-formoterol  had  no  effect.  (S,S)-formoterol  enhanced  the  inflammatory 
changes  in  the  peribronchial  and  perivascular  areas  without  affecting  early  and  late  allergic 
responses  or  airway  hyperresponsiveness.  (R,R)-formoterol  reduced  early  and  late  allergic 
responses and airway hyperresponsiveness as well as cellular infiltration in lung tissue. It was 
concluded  that  (S,S)-formoterol  may  exert  adverse  effects  in  asthma  control  by  activating 
mast cells to produce proinflammatory mediators such as IL-4 (Abraha, 2004). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No  safety  pharmacology  studies  with  budesonide  or  formoterol  were  included  in  this 
application  which  is  acceptable  in  view  of  the  well-known  clinical  use  of  budesonide  and 
formoterol.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The pharmacodynamic interactions of budesonide and formoterol are known from the clinical 
use  of  the  two  components  and  therefore  no  drug  interaction  studies  were  included  in  this 
application.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
The pharmacokinetics, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of budnesonide and 
formoterol  were  investigated  through  a  series  of  in  vitro,  ex  vivo  and  in  vivo  studies  in  the 
mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human. Budesonide and formoterol were administered either as 
[H3]-labelled  or  unlabelled  drug.  The  routes  of  administration  used  were  intravenous,  oral, 
inhalation,  nasal  instillation  and  intratracheal.  The  doses  of  drugs  and  species  used  in  a 
number of the pharmacokinetics studies reported were not specified.  
Methods of analysis 
High performance liquid chromatography or column liquid chromatoghaphy and electrospray 
tandem  mass  spectrometry  were  used  to  determine  the  plasma  levels  of  budesonide  and 
formoterol in plasma samples.  
Absorption  
A study was conducted to determine the pulmonary disposition of budesonide, formoterol or 
terbutaline (a β2- adrenergic receptor agonist). Isolated and perfused rat lung was exposed 
to respirable dry particle aerosols of budesonide, formoterol or terbutaline for approximately 
1 minute. Each short inhalation of the aerosols delivered 1 or 3 mg of budesonide, formoterol 
or  terbutaline  as  powder.  The  inhaled  drugs  appeared  rapidly  in  the  perfusate.  The 
concentration  of  budesonide  peaked  at  a  significantly  shorter  Tmax  than  that  of  formoterol, 
for both the low and high dose exposures (Ewing, 2008). 
An  isolated  and  perfused  rat  lung  model  with  negative  pressure  ventilation  was  used  in 
further  lung  absorption  experiments.  The  total  recovery  of  budesonide  in  the  perfusate, 
trachea  and  lung  tissue  was  94%  of  the  administered  dose.  The  high  absorption  rate  of 
budesonide, in combination with a relatively low extent of air-to-blood absorption, suggested 
that  the  drug  was  bound  to  the  lung  tissue.  The  lung-tissue  affinity  of  budesonide  was 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 26/117 
 
  
  
demonstrated  and  measured  using  the  isolated  and  perfused  lung  model,  but  was  not 
detected from the Caco-2 cell monolayer apparent permeability values obtained from in vitro 
transport studies. The lung affinity of budesonide after intratracheal administration to isolated 
perfused rat lungs was also reported (Tronde, 2003). 
In other experiments using isolated and perfused rat lungs, 45% of budesonide administered 
via airways was absorbed within 30 minutes. The remaining fraction was bound to lung tissue 
compartments and released slowly into the circulatory system (FDA, 2001).  
Animal studies have confirmed a relatively rapid and complete availability of budesonide after 
inhalation  or  nasal  instillation.  Rats  that  received  [3H]-budesonide  intratracheally  showed 
peak  plasma  levels  of  unchanged  compound  at  approximately  3  minutes  post  dose; 
concentrations  then  declined  rapidly  but  were  still  detectable  4  hours  after  dosing.  The 
plasma AUC of unchanged budesonide accounted for 61% of the radioactivity AUC; only one 
minor metabolite was detected 45 minutes post dose (Chanoine, 1991). 
In  an  inhalation  study  in  rats,  exposure  to  5  and  500  µg/kg  [3H]-budesonide  produced 
between  37  to  81%  of  deposited  radioactivity  in  the  upper  respiratory  and  gastrointestinal 
tracts at 30 minutes post-dose. Only 0.7 to 2.0% was recovered from the lung (FDA, 2001).  
Formoterol  was  shown  to  be  readily  absorbed  following  oral  and  inhalation  administration. 
The  bioavailability  of  formoterol  following  oral  and  intratracheal  administration  was  high, 
although  there  was  evidence  of  extensive  metabolism.  Peak  concentrations  of  formoterol 
were achieved 0.5 to 1 hour post oral and intratracheal administration (FDA, 2006).  
Distribution 
The  in  vitro  plasma  protein  binding  of  budesonide  in  rat  and  dog  was  found  to  be 
approximately 90% (FDA, 2001).  
The  in  vitro  protein  binding  of  formoterol  in  human  plasma  was  determined  at  0.1  to  100 
ng/mL  and  was  61%  to  64  %.  The  in  vitro  binding  of  formoterol  to  human  serum  albumin 
was  determined  at  5  to  500  ng/mL  and  was  31  to  38%.  The  concentrations  of  formoterol 
used  to  assess  the  plasma  protein  binding  were  higher  than  those  achieved  in  plasma 
following inhalation of a single 120 mg dose (PDR, 2012).  
The  relatively  long  tissue  retention  (lungs)  of  both  budesonide  and  formoterol  in  rats  has 
been reported. Formoterol had markedly longer tissue retention in the lungs than terbutaline 
(a short acting β2-agonist). The Applicant attributes the increased duration of clinical effect of 
formoterol,  compared  with  terbutaline,  to  its  higher  lipophilicity.  The  Applicant  states  that a 
possible  mechanism  of  the  delayed  clearance  of  budesonide  is  intracellular  fatty  acid 
esterification coupled with the high lipophilicity. This reversible esterification was reported to 
have  the  potential  to  prolong  the  anti-inflammatory  effect  of  budesonide  and  improve  its 
airway selectivity (Ewing, 2008). 
Investigation  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  budesonide  and  its  major  ester  metabolite, 
budesonide-21-oleate,  in  rats  following  inhalation  and  intravenous  administration  of 
unlabelled  and  [3H]-budesonide  showed  that  budesonide  oleate  was  formed  in  the  trachea, 
lung and skeletal muscle tissues but not in plasma; the half-life in the trachea was 18 to 20 
hours.  Accumulation  of  the  ester  in  the  trachea  gave  rise  to  high  and  persistent 
concentrations of active budesonide. Budesonide oleate appeared to have no effect on plasma 
levels of budesonide (Jendbro, 2001). 
CHMP assessment report

The  distribution  of  formoterol  following  inhalation  exposure  (species  not  specified)  was 
reported to be in the following order: trachea- lung- kidney- liver- plasma- heart- brain. Half-
lives of the drug ranged from 2 to 4 hours (FDA, 2006). 
Formoterol was shown to readily cross the placenta of pregnant rats (FDA, 2006). 
Metabolism 
Budesonide  was  rapidly  metabolised  in  in  vitro  liver  preparations  from  mice,  rats  and 
humans. Apart for the metabolic pathway involving cleavage of the nonsymmetric 16α, 17α-
acetal moiety which is unique to budesonide, its biotransformation is similar to that for other 
synthetic glucocorticoids (Edsbacker, 1987).  
The  formation  of  the  metabolites,  16α-hydroxyprednisolone  and  6β-hydroxybudesonide,  in 
the liver was shown to be catalysed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzymes (Jönsson, 1995). 
Both  metabolites  were  shown  to  have  very  little  pharmacological  activity  (less  than  1%  of 
budesonide) (Dollery, 1999). 
Formoterol  was  shown  to  be  extensively  metabolised  by  glucuronide  conjugation  and  o-
demethylation as the major pathways. Following oral administration, there was evidence of a 
hepatic first pass effect. Following intratracheal administration, there was some evidence of a 
first pass metabolic effect in the lung (FDA, 2006).  
Excretion 
In rats and dogs, elimination of [3H]-budesonide administered by various routes was mainly 
via  faeces.  In  the  rabbit,  approximately  equal  amounts  of  drug-related  radioactivity  were 
eliminated  in  urine  and  faeces.  Analysis  of  urine  and  bile  samples  revealed  only  trace 
amounts  of  unchanged  budesonide  demonstrating  its  extensive  biotransformation.  In 
humans, budesonide is excreted in urine and faeces in the form of inactive metabolites (FDA, 
2001). 
Formoterol  was  shown  to  be  primarily  eliminated  in  urine  and  smaller  quantities  by  biliary 
excretion. There was evidence of enterohepatic recirculation in rats and dogs. In  rats, small 
amounts of formoterol were excreted in milk (FDA, 2006). 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No  pharmacokinetic  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  included  in  this  application  since 
these  interactions  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  are  known  from  the  clinical  use  of  the  two 
components. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
No other pharmacokinetic studies have been reported in this application. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The  toxicology  studies  were  taken  from  the  FDA  Pharmacology  Reviews  (FDA,  2001;  FDA 
2006) cited unless otherwise specified. The doses of drugs and species used in a number of 
the toxicology studies reported were not specified.

Single dose toxicity 
Rat:  In  a  single  dose  inhalation  toxicity  study,  rats  were  exposed  to  air  or  dry  powder 
consisting  of  97  mg/kg  budesonide  and  3  mg/kg  formoterol  combined  for  1 hour  and 
observed for 14 days after exposure. Deposited doses of budesonide and formoterol were 7.9 
and  0.24  mg/kg,  respectively.  There  were  no  deaths.  Body  weight  gain  in  male  rats 
decreased  to  40% of  the  air-control  animals.  Female  rats  showed  an  8.3%  reduction  of  the 
initial body weight gain. Decreased absolute and relative weights of the spleen, thymus and 
adrenal  glands  were  observed  in  both  sexes.  These  changes  were  attributed  to  the 
pharmacological action of budesonide. 
Dog:  In  a  single  dose  inhalation  toxicity  study,  male  and  female  dogs  were  exposed  to  dry 
powder  consisting  of  737  μg/kg  budesonide  and  22  μg/kg  formoterol.  Deposited  doses  of 
budesonide  and  formoterol  were  117  and  3.3  μg/kg,  respectively.  There  were  no  deaths. 
Clinical  signs  observed  included  mucosal  redness,  body  tremor,  vomiting,  loose  stools, 
increased  salivation,  nasal  catarrh,  abdominal  respiration  and  redness  of  intact  skin.  Sinus 
tachycardia was observed in all dogs immediately after dosing and up to 4 hours post dose. 
Ventricular tachycardia was observed in a male (at 24 and 48 hours post dose) and a female 
(at 24 hours post dose) dog.

The  lowest  published  toxic  inhalation  dose  of  budesonide  in  rats  was  reported  to  be 
1.2 mg/m3  in  4 hours.  The  lowest  published  toxic  dose  of  budesonide  intratracheally 
administered to rabbits was reported to be 0.5 mg/kg (RTECS, 2011). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Budesonide: In 6-month repeated dose studies, rats were administered subcutaneous doses 
of  0.01  to  80  μg/kg  budesonide.  Decreased  body  weight  gain  and  food  consumption  were 
observed  in  the  20  and  80  μg/kg/day  dose  groups.  The  haematology  effects  observed 
included  increased  red  blood  cell  counts,  a  decrease  in  circulating  lymphocytes  and  their 
reduced  numbers 
in 
lymph  nodes.  Mammary  hyperplasia  was  also  observed.  At 
80 μg/kg/day,  hepatocyte  vacuolation  and  thymic  atrophy  were  observed  microscopically. 
Although a dose-related reduction in adrenal weights was observed at 5 to 80 μg/kg/day, no 
histopathological  changes  were  reported.  The  no-toxic-effect  level  was  reported  to  be 
5 μg/kg/day and the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) was 0.1 μg/kg/day (Ekman, 1987). 
Formoterol:  Subchronic  and  chronic  toxicology  studies  with  formoterol  were  conducted  in 
both  rats  and  dogs.  Studies  in  rats  included  3-,  6-,  and  24-month  inhalation  studies.  The 
longest  duration  inhalation  toxicology  study  in  dogs  was  1  month.  A  1-year  oral  toxicology 
study  was  conducted  in  dogs.  The  Applicant  states  that  the  6-month  inhalation  toxicology 
study in rats was considered sufficient to bridge the systemic toxicology studies of formoterol 
because deposited doses in rats greatly exceeded those that could be achieved in dogs, and 
neither  species  seemed  particularly  sensitive  to  the  local  effects  of  formoterol.  Thus,  the 
studies conducted were considered adequate to evaluate the toxicity of formoterol in terms of 
its local (respiratory) and systemic effects. 
The  lowest  published  toxic  inhalation  dose  of  formoterol  in  monkeys  was  reported  to  be 
0.14 μg/kg in a period of 10 months (RTECS, 2010). 
Budesonide and formoterol combined:  In 3 month inhalation toxicity studies in rats and 
dogs  administered  budesonide  and  formoterol  combined,  the  findings  observed  (not 
specified)  were  primarily  attributable  to  budesonide.  The  tachycardia  observed  in  dogs  was 
attributed  to  formoterol.  When  administered  in  combination,  no  potentiation  of  toxic  effects 
of budesonide and formoterol was observed. 
Genotoxicity 
In a series of genotoxicity studies, including the Ames test, recessive lethal test in Drosophila 
melanogaster, mouse lymphoma test, chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, 
DNA repair analysis in rat hepatocytes and mouse micronucleus assay, budesonide was not 
shown to be genotoxic.

In a series of genotoxicity studies, including the Ames test, chromosome aberration assay in 
human lymphocytes, mouse lymphoma assay and rat micronucleus assay, formoterol was not 
shown to be genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
In a 91-week oral carcinogenicity study in mice orally administered 200 μg/kg budesonide, no 
carcinogenic effects were reported. Three 2-year oral carcinogenicity studies with budesonide 
were conducted in rats. In one study, 50 μg/kg budesonide produced an increased incidence 
of  glioma.  However,  this  was  not  confirmed  in  two  subsequent  carcinogenicity  studies. 
Budesonide  also  produced  hepatocellular  tumours,  which  were  reported  to  be  a  finding 
typically observed with other glucocorticoids.  
In  a  2  year  study,  rats  dosed  with  5 μg/mL  budesonide  in  drinking  water  showed  an 
increased  incidence  of  liver  tumors.  Additional  groups  of  rats  were  dosed  with  the  synthetic 
glucocorticoids  prednisolone  (40 μg/mL)  and  triamcinolone  (1.5  μg/mL).  Reduced  survival 
and  body  weight  gain  was  observed  in  all  drug-treated  groups.  An  increased  incidence  of 
combined  hepatocellular  adenomas/carcinomas  occurred  with  all  three  compounds.  The 
findings were therefore regarded as a class effect of glucocorticoids (Ryrfeldt, 1992). 
In  2-year  carcinogenicity  studies  conducted  with  formoterol  in  mice  (orally  dosed  up  to  2.5 
mg/kg/day)  and  rats  (inhalation  doses  of  up  to  130  μg/kg/day),  there  were  findings  of 
increased incidences of ovary and/or uterine leiomyomas. These findings were reported to be 
typical  effects  observed  with  other  β2-agonists,  however,  a  reference  to  support  this 
statement was not provided. The Applicant should cite a reference to support this statement 
in a revised Non-clinical Overview. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits.  
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Budesonide  was  shown  to  have  no  effect  on  fertility  when  administered  subcutaneously 
(species  and  doses  used  were  not  specified).  In  male  rats,  the  oral  administration  of 
formoterol reduced fertility, although the dose at which this occurred was not specified. 
Embryo-fœtal development 
Budesonide:  In  rats  and  rabbits,  subcutaneous  doses  (not  specified)  of  budesonide  was 
teratogenic  and  embryocidal.  These  effects  were  not  seen  in  rats  that  received  inhalation 
doses  of  up  to  250 μg/kg/day  budesonide.  Epidemiological  data  indicated  that  budesonide 
had no risk to humans during pregnancy.  
Formoterol:  Oral  doses  (not  specified)  of  formoterol  was  teratogenic  in  both  rats  and 
rabbits. No teratogenic effects were reported in rats following inhalation exposure to doses of 
up to 91 μg/kg/day formoterol. 
Combination:  The  budesonide  and  formoterol  combination  was  shown  to  be  teratogenic  in 
rats following inhalation exposure to high doses. In an embryo-fetal development study, rats 
were  exposed  to  a  combination  of  budesonide/formoterol  (in  a  Symbicort  HFA  pMDI 
formulation)  by  nose-only  inhalation  at  actual  doses  of  2.5/  0.14,  12/0.66  and  80/4.4 
μg/kg/day from Days 6 to 16 of gestation. Deposited doses of budesonide/formoterol for low, 
mid,  and  high  dose  groups  were  0.24/0.014,  1.01/0.057  and  6.8/0.39  μg/kg/day, 
respectively.  The  mid  and  high  doses  were  found  to  be  teratogenic.  An  external 
CHMP assessment report

malformation, umbilical hernia, was observed in a single fetus at the mid dose and 2 fetuses 
at  the  high  dose.  These  incidences  (of  0.4  and  0.9%)  exceeded  the  mean  historical  control 
incidence  of  0.01%.  A  visceral  malformation,  aortic  arch:  right  sided,  was  observed  in  one 
fetus in the high dose group. Fused stemebra was also observed in a single fetus in the high 
dose group. The relationship of these findings to treatment was unclear. Incidences of no or 
incomplete ossification were increased in the high dose group. The incidence of a 14th right 
rib  was  reported  to  be  higher  in  the  treatment  groups.  Maternal  toxicity  was  evident  in  the 
high dose group. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
No pre and postnatal development studies with budesonide and formoterol were reported.    
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated  
No  juvenile  toxicity  studies  with  budesonide  or  formoterol  have  been  included  in  the 
application, which is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic analyses were not reported for any of the toxicology studies. This is acceptable 
in view of the many years clinical use of budesonide and formoterol. 
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies conducted with budesonide were reported. This is acceptable as no 
concerns  appear  to  have  arisen  from  its  clinical  use  that  warrants  the  necessity  of  these 
studies. In dogs, formoterol caused slight reactive changes at sites of subcutaneous injection.  
Other toxicity studies 
Haemolysis: The haemolytic/protein flocculation potential of formoterol was assessed in vitro. 
Formoterol  did  not  produce  haemolysis  or  protein  flocculation.  No  haemolysis  or  protein 
flocculation studies with budnesonide were reported. 
Antigenicity,  immunotoxicity,  dependence,  metabolites:  No  antigenicity,  immunotoxicity, 
dependence  and  metabolite  studies  with  budesonide  or  formoterol  have  been reported.  This 
is  acceptable  as  no  concerns  have  arisen  during  the  many  years  of  their  clinical  use  that 
warrant the need for these studies. 
Impurities:  The 
impurity  profiles  of 
the  Symbicort  Turbohaler  80  microgram/4.5 
microgram/inhalation,  inhalation  powder  and  budesonide/formoterol  Spiromax  80/4.5, 
160/4.5,  320/9  µg  per  dose,  inhalation  powder  products  are  reported  to  be  similar.  The 
impurities levels were reported to be below the qualification threshold, as defined by the ICH 
Note  for  Guidance  on  Impurities in  New  Drug  Products  (CPMP/ICH/2738/99)  and  should  not 
cause any safety concerns. 
Excipients: Safety assessment studies of excipients were conducted. The only excipient used 
in  budesonide/formoterol  Spiromax  formulation  is  lactose  monohydrate  which  is  a  standard 
compendial  excipient,  commonly  used  in  pharmaceutical  preparations.  There  are  no 
toxicological concerns with lactose monohydrate at the doses used in the proposed product. 
Phototoxicity: No phototoxicity studies with budesonide and formoterol were reported, which 
is  acceptable  as  no  concerns  have  arisen  during  the  many  years  of  their  clinical  use  that 
warrant the need for these studies.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for  Human  use  [EMEA/CHMP/SWP4447/00],  a  justification 
for  the  absence  of  an 
environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  has  been  provided.  The  applicant  states  that  the 
proposed  budesonide/formoterol  Spiromax  80/4.5,  160/4.5,  320/9  µg  per  dose,  inhalation 
powder  products  would  replace  the  currently  marketed  medicinal  products  and  hence  the 
exposure  of  the  environment  to  budesonide  and  formoterol  is  not  likely  to  increase. 
Therefore, the absence of ERA is considered acceptable. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  studies  in  vitro,  ex  vivo  and  in  vivo  have 
been conducted with budesonide and formoterol alone and in combination.  
No safety pharmacology studies and pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been provided 
by the applicant. This is considered acceptable by the CHMP since this information is already 
known from the clinical use of the two components and since being a hybrid application it can 
rely on the results of pre-clinical tests of the reference product. 
The pharmacokinetics, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of budnesonide and 
formoterol  were  investigated  through  a  series  of  in  vitro,  ex  vivo  and  in  vivo  studies  in  the 
mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human. Budesonide and formoterol were administered either as 
[H3]-labelled  or  unlabelled  drug.  The  routes  of  administration  used  were  intravenous,  oral, 
inhalation, nasal instillation and intratracheal.  
The  toxicology  studies  were  taken  from  the  FDA  Pharmacology  Reviews  (FDA,  2001;  FDA 
2006) cited unless otherwise specified.  
The justification for the absence of an environmental risk assessment ERA is acceptable and 
an  ERA  is  not  deemed  necessary.  The  proposed  budesonide/formoterol  Spiromax  80/4.5, 
160/4.5, 320/9 µg per dose, inhalation powder products are considered unlikely to present a 
risk to the environment when use as prescribed. 
Therefore  on  the  basis  of  the  considerable  amount  of  published  scientific  evidences  on 
budesonide/formoterol  combination,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  Budesonide/Formoterol 
inhalation  powder  produces  the  claimed  pharmacological  activity  and  can  be  safely 
administered within therapeutic indications. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical program performed by the Applicant was considered adequate to support this 
hybrid application for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  development  of  this  new  fixed-dose  combination  orally  inhaled  product  (OIP)  follows 
the  CHMP  Guideline  on  OIPs  (CPMP/EWP/4151/00  Rev.  1)  and  aims  to  demonstrate 
therapeutic  equivalence  of  this  new  product  to  the  reference  product  authorised  in  a 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 33/117 
 
  
  
Member State or in the Community on the basis of a complete dossier. The development is 
based on the demonstration of pharmacokinetic equivalence between each strength of this 
fixed-dose  combination,  BF  Spiromax2  and  the  corresponding  strength  of  the  reference 
product, Symbicort Turbohaler.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Asthma 
DuoResp  Spiromax  is  indicated  in  the  regular  treatment  of  asthma,  where  use  of  a 
combination  (inhaled  corticosteroid  and  long-acting  beta2-adrenoceptor  agonist)  is 
appropriate: 
- patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and “as needed”inhaled 
short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists. 
or 
-  patients  already  adequately  controlled  on  both  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  long-acting 
beta2-adrenoceptor agonists. 
DuoResp Spiromax 80 micrograms/4.5 micrograms per dose is not appropriate in patients 
with severe asthma. 
COPD  (DuoResp  Spiromax  160/4.5  micrograms  per  dose  and  DuoResp  Spiromax  320/9 
micrograms per dose only) 
Symptomatic treatment of patients with severe COPD (FEV1 < 50% predicted normal) and 
a  history  of  repeated  exacerbations,  who  have  significant  symptoms  despite  regular 
therapy with long-acting bronchodilators. 
The  therapeutic  indications  stated  are  identical  to  the  therapeutic  indications  of  the 
reference  fixed-dose  combination  products  containing  the  same  active  substances  and 
formulated  as  an  inhalation  powders  in  the  UK  (Symbicort  Turbohaler  100  micrograms/6 
micrograms/inhalation,  inhalation  powder,  Symbicort  Turbohaler  200  micrograms/6 
micrograms/inhalation,  inhalation  powder  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  400  micrograms/12 
micrograms/inhalation, inhalation powder). 
 The proposed route of administration is for inhalation use.  
One pharmacodynamic study has been carried out but no Phase 3 clinical efficacy or safety 
studies  have  been  conducted  comparing  the  test  and  reference  products  in  adults  or 
adolescents.  
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on several occasions pertaining to 
quality and clinical aspects of the dossier.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.  
2 BF Spiromax – The Applicant refers to this fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate as BF 
Spiromax.     The CHMP uses the same term in order to avoid confusion across documents.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
•  Bioavailability 
No  bioavailability  studies  were  submitted  since  the  clinical  pharmacology  of  budesonide 
and formoterol fumarate has been investigated extensively in the past, is well known and 
has  been  the  subject  of  many  publications.  The  development  of  this  new  fixed-dose 
combination  OIP  aims  to  demonstrate  therapeutic  equivalence  of  these  new  products  to 
appropriate  reference  products  and  the  development  is  based  on  the  demonstration  of 
pharmacokinetic  and/or  pharmacodynamic  equivalence  between  each  strength  of  this 
fixed-dose  combination,  BF  Spiromax  and  the  corresponding  strength  of  the  reference

product, Symbicort Turbohaler.  
•  Bioequivalence  
Three  pilot  studies, 
three  supportive  bioequivalence  studies  and 
three  pivotal 
bioequivalence studies, one at each of three strengths, were presented to characterise the 
pharmacokinetic  profile  of  BF  Spiromax  (test  product)  and  to  compare  this  with  that  of 
Symbicort  Turbohaler  (reference  product)  to  assess  whether  these  two  fixed-dose 
combination products are therapeutically equivalent.  
All studies saw the recruitment of male and female healthy volunteers and were of similar 
design: single centre, single dose, open-label, crossover studies. Volunteers recruited were 
aged  18  to  45  years,  inclusive,  had  a  body  mass  index  of  19  to  30kg/m2  and  a  body 
weight  ≥50kg.  Subjects  were  non-smokers  for  at  least  1  year  prior  to the  screening  visit 
and had a maximum smoking history of 5-pack years (equivalent of one pack per day for 
five  years).  Pregnant  women,  women  trying  to  become  pregnant  and  women  who  were 
breast feeding were excluded. All subjects recruited underwent appropriate training in the 
proper  use  of  both  the  BF  Spiromax  and  the  Symbicort  Turbohaler  devices  and  had  to 
demonstrate  an  adequate  inspiratory  flow  rate  of  greater  than  or  equal  to  60  litres  per 
minute. 
All studies used the same sampling schedules, pharmacokinetic endpoints and analyses for 
comparison of all pharmacokinetic profiles. All pharmacokinetic parameters for budesonide 
and  formoterol  fumarate  were  calculated  by  non-compartmental  analysis  methods  from 
the concentration-time data. Area under the curve, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf, Cmax, tmax and 
t½ were calculated for both budesonide and formoterol fumarate in each study. 
The primary endpoints were AUC0-t (calculated using the trapezoidal rule) and Cmax. Data 
were  natural  log-transformed  prior  to  statistical  analysis.  Comparisons  between  BF 
Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  were  carried  out  using  a  parametric  ANOVA  model 
with  terms  for  sequence,  period,  treatment  group  and  a  random  effect  of  subject  within 
sequence. The treatment difference and the associated 90% CI estimated from the ANOVA 
analysis on the log scale were back-transformed to obtain the estimated ratio of geometric 
means  between  treatment  groups  and  the  90%  CI  for  this  ratio.  BF  Spiromax  and 
Symbicort  Turbohaler  were  to  be  considered  similar  if  the  90%  CIs  of  the  ratios  of 
geometric means for both budesonide and formoterol fumarate were contained within the 
acceptance  range  of  0.8  to  1.25.  However,  if  the  RMS  error  for  Cmax  in  the  ANOVA 
crossover  model  exceeded  0.30,  indicating  high  intra-subject  variability,  the  acceptance 
criteria  for  Cmax  could  be  widened  to  a  maximum  of  (0.6984,  1.4319)  in  line  with  the 
CHMP  Guideline  on  the  investigation  of  bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev. 
1/Corr 2012). Comparison of tmax between treatment groups was primarily based on the 
Wilcoxon signed rank test applied to the period differences.  
The  pharmacokinetic  bioequivalence  studies  in  the  BF  Spiromax  clinical  development 
programme were all single centre, open-label, single dose, crossover studies, with washout 
periods  ranging  across  the  studies  from  at  least  5  days  to  between  7  and  14  days  in 
duration,  set  up  to  compare  the  pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  budesonide  and  formoterol 
fumarate  administered  as  BF  Spiromax  with  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate 
administered  as  Symbicort  Turbohaler.  All  studies  saw  recruitment  of  male  and  female 
healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 45 years, inclusive, with no history or current evidence of 
clinically significant concomitant disease.  
In  each  study,  subjects  had  to  complete  a  training  period  and  demonstrate  an  adequate 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 38/117 
 
  
  
inspiratory  flow  rate  of  ≥ 60  L/min,  ability  to  use  both  the  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort 
Turbohaler devices and have no tolerability issues with the active drug substances in either 
BF Spiromax or Symbicort Turbohaler prior to entering the treatment phase of the study.  
The pharmacokinetic profiles of budesonide and formoterol fumarate were characterised in 
each  study  after  single  doses  of  two  inhalations  of  study  treatments  in  each  treatment 
period. Two inhalations of both the test and reference products were administered in order 
to  optimise  the  ability  to  detect  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  over  their  entire 
pharmacokinetic  profile.  Where  subjects  were  randomised  to  receive  co-administration  of 
activated  charcoal,  a  suspension  of  5g  activated  charcoal  in  water  was  administered  2 
minutes before and 2, 62, 122, and 242 minutes after dose inhalation. 
In each study plasma samples were obtained pre-dose, and at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 
minutes  and  at  1.0,  1.5,  2.0,  3.0,  4.0,  6.0,  8.0,  12.0,  18.0  and  24.0  hours  post-dose. 
Plasma  concentrations  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  were  determined  using  validated 
assay procedures as described. 
The primary pharmacokinetic endpoints in the bioequivalence studies for both budesonide 
and formoterol fumarate were: 
•  area  under  the  plasma  concentration-time  curve  from  time  zero  to  the  last 
quantifiable concentration as measured up to 24 hours post-dose (AUC0-t)  
and  
•  maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)  
In  each  study,  safety  was  monitored  by  clinical  laboratory  examinations,  12-lead 
electrocardiograms  (ECGs),  physical  examination,  vital  signs  and  recording  of  adverse 
events (AEs). 
Each  strength  of  BF  Spiromax  was  developed  and  evaluated  in  separate  pharmacokinetic 
studies.  Pharmacokinetic  equivalence  was  not  achieved  initially  for  one  or  both  drug 
moieties  and  therefore  changes  to  the  dose  cup  size  or  formulation  were  made  to  better 
match the performance of the Spiromax Inhaler to the Turbohaler at a given strength. 
A) High Strength – DuoResp Spiromax 320/9 µg per dose, inhalation powder  
Four  pharmacokinetic  equivalence  studies  were  presented  in  the  dossier,  one  pilot  study 
(BFC-AS-101),  two  supportive  studies  (BFS-AS-105  and  BFS-AS-107)  and  one  pivotal 
study (BFS-BE-109). These are presented below: 
Pilot and supportive pharmacokinetic studies: 
Study BFC-AS-101 (n=18) – pilot study at the high strength not powered for formal 
bioequivalence assessments 
This study, an early pilot study not powered for formal bioequivalence but set up to evaluate 
the in vitro/in vivo relationship for BF Spiromax relative to Symbicort Turbohaler, compared 
two batches of BF Spiromax 320/9µg, each with a different fine particle dose (FPD), with 
Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12µg. Based on the in vitro/in vivo relationship observed in this 
pilot study, a pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study was carried out to evaluate whether the

device and formulation selected for BF Spiromax at the high strength could be shown to be 
bioequivalent to Symbicort Turbohaler.  
For both batches of BF Spiromax, the systemic availability of plasma budesonide was 
comparable with that from Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios of AUClast 
were contained within the acceptance limits of 0.8, 1.25. For the secondary endpoints AUC0-
inf and Cmax, the 90% CIs for the ratios were also contained within these acceptance limits 
(0.8, 1.25) but with the exception of Cmax for Batch B, which was slightly higher for BF 
Spiromax than for Symbicort Turbohaler (0.97, 1.31). 
The systemic availability of plasma formoterol fumarate was higher for BF Symbicort Batch A 
than for Symbicort Turbohaler for all endpoints. For Batch B, the systemic availability of 
formoterol fumarate was contained within the acceptance limits (0.8, 1.25) but with the 
exception of Cmax which was slightly higher for BF Spiromax than for Symbicort Turbohaler 
with the 90% CI for the ratio just outside the acceptance range (0.95, 1.30). 
Study BFS-AS-105 (n=88) – initial pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study – a 
supportive study at the high strength  
This study was a single dose, four-period crossover study set up to compare the 
pharmacokinetic profiles of budesonide and formoterol fumarate following administration of 
BF Spiromax 320/9µg and Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12µg, with and without charcoal 
blockade, in healthy volunteers. The primary pharmacokinetic endpoints were evaluated for 
the intent-to-treat (ITT) population – 88 subjects were randomised to treatment, 83 
completed all four treatment periods, all 88 subjects were included in the ITT and safety 
populations.  
Five subjects were withdrawn from the study as follows: 
•  Subject 10002 (Treatment Period 1; Male; BF Spiromax) was withdrawn from the 
study due to over volunteering on 08JAN2010. The subject screened for a study with 
another CRO while he confirmed for admission for Treatment Period 1 of this study. 
Study drug administration for Treatment Period 1 was on 05JAN2010. 
•  Subject 10003 (Treatment Period 4; Male; Symbicort Turbohaler + charcoal) was 
withdrawn from the study due to a sleep disorder (cataplexy) on 26JAN2010. Study 
drug administration for Treatment Period 4 was on 26JAN2010, but the subject did 
not receive the last 2 charcoal doses. 
•  Subject 10053 (Treatment Period 1; Male; Symbicort Turbohaler) was withdrawn due 
to the use of concomitant medication (antibiotics) on 12FEB2010. Study drug 
administration for Treatment Period 1 was on 06FEB2010. 
•  Subject 10056 (Treatment Period 3; Female; BF Spiromax + charcoal) was withdrawn 
due to an adverse event (toothache) on 26FEB2010. Study drug administration for 
Treatment Period 3 was on 20FEB2010. 
•  Subject 10087 (Treatment Period 3; Female; BF Spiromax + charcoal) was withdrawn 
due to an adverse event (acute gastroenteritis) on 03MAR2010. Study drug 
administration for Treatment Period 3 was on 24FEB2010.

BE = bioequivalence 
a From Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. 
b For tmax, this represents the estimated treatment difference. 
In the absence of charcoal blockade, bioequivalence was demonstrated for AUC0-t and AUC0-
inf for budesonide as the 90% CIs for the ratios were both within the accepted bioequivalence 
range (0.8, 1.25) – see the table above. However Cmax for budesonide was slightly higher 
for BF Spiromax 320/9µg than for Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12µg and the 90% CIs for the 
ratio were not contained within (0.8, 1.25). 
In  the  presence  of  charcoal  blockade  equivalence  for  AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf  and  Cmax  was 
demonstrated  –  90%  CIs  for  the  ratios  were  all  within  the  accepted  bioequivalence  range 
(0.8, 1.25).  
No  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  products  in  terms  of  time  to  reach  peak 
budesonide concentration in plasma were seen either following charcoal blockade or without 
charcoal blockade.

b For tmax, this represents the estimated treatment difference. 
In the absence of charcoal blockade, bioequivalence was not demonstrated for AUC0-t, AUC0-
inf or Cmax for formoterol fumarate as the 90% CIs for all ratios were marginally outside the 
accepted  bioequivalence  range  (0.8,  1.25) –  see  the  table  above.  However,  in  the  presence 
of  charcoal  blockade,  bioequivalence  was  demonstrated  for  all  three  variables  (90%  CIs  for 
the ratios were all contained within (0.8, 1.25).  
No  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  products  in  terms  of  time  to  reach  peak 
formoterol fumarate concentration in plasma were seen either following charcoal blockade or 
without charcoal blockade. 
Systemic Exposure in BFS-AS-105 (ITT population) 
Minimal change in Cmax and a decrease in AUC were observed for budesonide (13.4%) and 
formoterol  fumarate  (20.6%)  in  the  presence  versus  the  absence  of  charcoal  blockade 
following BF Spiromax administration. 
In  contrast,  while  AUC0-t  was  essentially  unchanged,  Cmax  increased  by  12.7%  for 
budesonide and 18.4% for formoterol fumarate in the presence of charcoal blockade following 
Symbicort  Turbohaler  administration.  The  Applicant  considered  this  finding  unexpected  in 
that  charcoal  blockade  should  not  affect  Cmax  which  is  almost  entirely  due  to  pulmonary 
absorption of OIPs. There is no physiological reason why Cmax for formoterol fumarate would 
be  higher  in  the  presence  versus  the  absence  of  charcoal  blockade  as  the  charcoal  block  is 
designed to reduce orally available drug absorption. Furthermore AUC should be reduced for 
both  drugs  following  charcoal  blockade  due  to  each  having  measurable  oral  bioavailability. 
The  expected  pattern  was  observed  for  BF  Spiromax  but  not  for  Symbicort  Turbohaler; 
according  to  the  Applicant  this  was  believed  to  be  due  to  dose  to  dose  variability  from  the 
Turbohaler device. This explanation was acknowledged by the CHMP. 
Study BFS-AS-107 (n=72) – second pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study – a 
supportive study at the high strength  
In  order  to  confirm  bioequivalence  between  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  at  the 
high  strength  following  the  completion  of  Study  BFC-AS-105  above,  Study  BFS-AS-107  was 
set  up  to  further  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  budesonide  and  formoterol 
fumarate in the absence of charcoal blockade.

This  was  an  open-label,  randomised,  four-period  crossover,  replicate  treatment,  single-dose 
study  to  compare  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  BF  Spiromax  320/9µg  with  Symbicort 
Turbohaler  400/12µg  in  healthy  volunteers.  This  study  was  designed  to  further  evaluate 
pharmacokinetic parameters as measured in Study BFS-AS-105 in which bioequivalence was 
not established. In addition, this study was designed to assess intra-subject variability since 
high dose-to-dose variability with Symbicort Turbohaler was believed to have contributed to 
the  findings  in  Study  BFS-AS-105.  In  this  regard,  the  intrasubject  variability  with  BF 
Spiromax  320/9µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  400/12µg  was  also  determined  from  replicate 
treatment arms for both treatments. The primary pharmacokinetic endpoints were evaluated 
for  both  the  ITT  and  the  per  protocol  (PP)  population  –  72  subjects  were  randomised  to 
treatment, 70 completed all four treatment periods, all 72 subjects were included in the ITT 
and safety populations and 71 were included in the PP population. This approach followed the 
written scientific advice received from CHMP.

BE = bioequivalence 
As in the earlier studies, again bioequivalence for formoterol fumarate through Cmax was not 
achieved  between  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler.  The  clinical  relevance  of  this 
finding  was  evaluated  in  the  pharmacodynamic  study,  Study  BFS-AS-106  (described  under 
section 2.4.3 Pharmacodynamics below). 
PIVOTAL pharmacokinetic study 
Study BFS-BE-109 (n=90) – third pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study – a pivotal 
study at the high strength

Based on the findings in respect of Cmax for formoterol fumarate (which were similar across 
all  three  strength  products  –  see  Studies  BFS-AS-105  and  BFS-AS-107,  above  and  Studies 
BFS-AS-104  and  BFS-AS-103  below)  the  Applicant  considered  that  a  common  cause  maybe 
responsible for the lack of bioequivalence. In vitro evaluation of possible solutions to achieve 
pharmacokinetic bioequivalence for formoterol fumarate with regard to Cmax, suggested that 
a  change  in  the  micronization  process  for  the  drug  substance,  to  produce  a  larger  particle 
size,  might  enable  the  achievement  of  pharmacokinetic  bioequivalence  for  the  formoterol 
fumarate  comparisons  of  test  and  reference  products.  This  hypothesis  was  tested  and 
validated in a pilot study carried out with the middle strength of BF Spiromax and Symbicort 
Turbohlaer (see study BFS-BE-110 below). Based on the findings of this pilot study the high 
strength  product  was  modified  by  inclusion  of  coarser  formoterol  fumarate  particles  and  a 
repeat pivotal pharmacokinetic study with the high strength was carried out with and without 
charcoal blockade.  
This was a single-centre, open-label, randomized, five-period crossover, single dose study to 
assess  the  pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  following 
administration  of  Spiromax  320/9µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  400/12µg  with  and  without 
charcoal blockade. Subjects were randomised one of 10 treatment sequences and to ensure 
consistency  all  dosing  occurred  between  08.00hours  and  10.00hours.  The  primary 
pharmacokinetic  endpoints  were  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  for  both  budesonide  and  formoterol 
fumarate for the PP population. A total of 90 subjects were randomised to treatment and 87 
subjects  completed  all  five  treatment  periods.  All  90  subjects  were  included  in  the  ITT  and 
safety populations and 87 were included in the PP population. 
There were 3 subject-withdrawals during the study: 
•  Subject No. 2019 was not able to attend scheduled study visit during Period 4 within 
timelines required by the protocol. This deviation was considered as major and the 
subject was withdrawn from the study. 
•  Subject No. 2081 withdrew his consent during the wash-out period between Period 4 
and Period 5. He was withdrawn from the study before the fifth Treatment Period. 
•  Subject No. 2086 was withdrawn from the study because he took a concomitant 
treatment during the wash-out period between Period 3 and Period 4.

the 90% CIs for the ratios were all within the accepted range for bioequivalence (0.8, 1.25).  
Confidence  intervals  generated  for  tmax  demonstrated  no  statistically  significant  difference

In the pivotal study (study BFS-BE-109), the study in which BF Spiromax contained a mix of 
the same two active substances but employed a change in the micronization process for the 
formoterol  fumarate  drug  substance  to  produce  a  larger  and  more  coarse  formoterol 
fumarate  particle  size,  BF  Spiromax  320/9µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  400/12µg  were 
shown  to  be  bioequivalent  in  respect  of  both  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate 
pharmacokinetic parameters, when administered both with and without charcoal blockade.

B) Middle Strength – DuoResp Spiromax 160/4.5 µg per dose, inhalation powder  
Three pharmacokinetic equivalence studies were presented in the dossier, one pilot (BFS-BE-
110), one supportive (BFS-AS-104) and one pivotal study (BFS-BE-108). 
Supportive and pilot pharmacokinetic studies 
Study BFS-AS-104 (n=90) – fourth pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study – a 
supportive study at the middle strength  
This  was  an  open-label,  randomised,  five-period  crossover  study  to  compare  the 
pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  BF  Spiromax  160/4.5µg  with  Symbicort  Turbohaler  200/6µg 
administered  with  and  without  a  charcoal  blockade.  The  intra-subject  variability  with 
Symbicort  Turbohaler  was  also  to  be  determined  by  replicate  treatment  of  the  Symbicort 
Turbohaler without charcoal treatment arm.  
Subjects  were  randomised  one  of  10  treatment  sequences  and  to  ensure  consistency  all 
dosing occurred between 07.00hours and 09.00hours. 
The  primary  pharmacokinetic  endpoints  were  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  for  both  budesonide  and 
formoterol  fumarate  for  the  PP  population.  A  total  of  90  subjects  were  randomised  to 
treatment and 86 subjects completed all five treatment periods. All 90 subjects were included 
the safety population and 89 were included in the ITT and PP populations. 
The root mean square error in the ANOVA crossover exceeded 0.30 for Symbicort Turbohaler, 
indicating  high  intra-subject  variability,  therefore  the  acceptance  criteria  for  Cmax  were 
widened to a maximum of (0.698, 1.43)3 for the comparison of BF Spiromax with Symbicort 
Turbohaler.

Bioequivalence  was  not  demonstrated  for  any  of  AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf  or  Cmax  either  in  the 
presence  or  absence  of  charcoal  for  budesonide  or  formoterol  fumarate.  The  CIs  generated 
for  tmax  demonstrated  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  test  and  reference 
products in terms of time to reach peak budesonide or formoterol fumarate concentration in 
plasma. 
Study BFS-BE-110 (n=20) – pilot study 
This  was  a  pilot  study  and  was  not  powered  for  formal  bioequivalence  assessments.  The 
study  was  set  up  to  evaluate  the  in  vitro/in  vivo  correlation  for  BF  Spiromax  relative  to 
Symbicort  Turbohaler  for  the  middle  strength  product,  DuoResp  Spiromax  160/4.5  µg  per 
dose,  inhalation  powder  and  used  four  batches  of  BF  Spiromax  each  with  a  different 
formulation  and  different  in  vitro  performance  characteristics.  The  study  assessed  key 
formulation parameters identified in the in vivo studies: 
•  Metered dose (device cup volume) 
• 
Formulation blend strength

•  Drug substance particle size and lactose particle size.  
The formulation options are summarised in the table below: 
 BF Spiromax Formulation Options Investigated in Study BFS-BE-110 
This  was  a  single-centre,  open-label,  single-dose,  five-way  crossover  study  and  to  ensure 
consistency,  all  dosing  occurred  between  08.00hours  and  10.00hours.  Subjects  were 
randomised to one of 10 treatment sequences. 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  budesonide  and 
formoterol  fumarate  following  two  inhalations  from  four  batches  of  BF  Spiromax  (Batch  A, 
Batch  B,  Batch  C  and  Batch  D)  and  two  inhalations  from  a  single  batch  of  Symbicort 
Turbohaler. The study used BF Spiromax 160/4.5µg and Symbicort Turbohaler 200/6µg. 
A  total  of  20  subjects  were  randomised  to  treatment.  Eighteen  subjects  completed  all  five 
treatment periods. One subject had a motor bike accident between treatment periods 4 and 5 
and  withdrew  and  one  subject  experienced  mild  cough  between  treatment  period  2  and  3. 
The 18 subjects who completed the study were included in the PP population. All randomised 
subjects were included in the safety and ITT populations. 
In  vitro  evaluation  of  possible  solutions  to  achieve  pharmacokinetic  bioequivalence  for 
formoterol  fumarate  with  regard  to  Cmax,  suggested  that  a  change  in  the  micronisation 
process  for  the  drug  substance,  to  produce  a  larger  particle  size,  might  enable  the 
achievement  of  pharmacokinetic  bioequivalence  for  the  formoterol  fumarate  comparisons  of 
test and reference products.  
The findings were as follows: 
• 
• 
For batches A and C of BF Spiromax the systemic availability of plasma budesonide 
was not comparable with Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios of 
AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax were not contained within (0.8, 1.25) 
For batches B and D of BF Spiromax the systemic availability of plasma budesonide 
was comparable with Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios of AUC0-t,

and AUC0-inf were contained within (0.8, 1.25); however, Cmax, for both batch B and 
batch D was not contained within (0.8, 1.25); 
For all four batches, there were no appreciable differences between BF Spiromax and 
Symbicort Turbohaler with respect to BUD t½ and tmax. 
For batches A and D of BF Spiromax, the systemic availability of plasma formoterol 
fumarate was comparable with Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios 
of AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf were contained within (0.8, 1.25); however, Cmax, for both 
batches was not contained within (0.8, 1.25). Both of these batches utilised the 
original formoterol fumarate drug substance; 
For batch B of BF Spiromax, the systemic availability of plasma formoterol fumarate 
was comparable with Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios of AUC0-t, 
AUC0-inf and Cmax were all contained within (0.8, 1.25); 
For batch C the systemic availability of plasma formoterol fumarate was not 
comparable with Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios of AUC0-t, 
AUC0-inf and Cmax were not contained within (0.8, 1.25).  
Both batch B and batch C used formoterol fumarate drug substance from the new 
micronization process which resulted in a larger particle size; 
• 
For all four batches there were no appreciable differences between BF Spiromax and 
Symbicort Turbohaler with respect to FOR t½ and tmax. 
A higher formoterol Cmax was observed with all three strengths for BF Spiromax (low, middle 
and  high)  compared  with  Symbicort  Turbohaler.  As  explained  above,  subsequent  further  in 
vitro  evaluation  of  BF  Spiromax  aiming  at  achieving  pharmacokinetic  bioequivalence  for 
formoterol  fumarate  Cmax  suggested  that  a  change  in  the  micronisation  process  for  the 
formoterol  fumarate  drug  substance,  such  that  a  larger  particle  would  be  produced,  might 
help  achieve  bioequivalence  for  all  formoterol  fumarate  comparisons.  This  hypothesis  was 
tested and validated in this pilot pharmacokinetic study carried out with the middle strengths 
of BF Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler (study BFS-BE-110). The results indicated that the 
smaller the particle size the higher the formoterol fumarate Cmax and that a larger, coarser 
particle size produced a lower Cmax.  
The  use  of  formoterol  fumarate  drug  substance  micronised  by  an  alternative  micronisation 
process, resulting in larger particles, appeared to correct this difference between the test and 
reference  products  in  Cmax  for  the  high  and  middle  strength  products.  Therefore,  the 
Applicant stated their intention to use this new fomoterol fumarate formulation (with larger, 
coarser  particles)  for  the  low  strength  product  as  well  as  for  the  two  higher  strengths  and 
believed  that  pharmacokinetic  equivalence  for  formoterol  fumarate  could  be  extrapolated  to 
the low strength product from the middle and high strength pharmacokinetic studies (studies 
BFS-BE-108 and BFS-BE-109). 
Based  on  the  findings  of  the  pilot  study  (study  BFS-BE-110),  the  middle  strength  BF 
Spiromax  product  was  modified  also  by  the  use  of  the  high  strength  formulation  which  was 
subsequently  filled  into  a  half-sized  dose  cup  device  and  by  a  change  in  the  micronisation 
process for the formoterol fumarate drug substance and a change in the grade of lactose, to 
produce a larger and coarser particle size. All other components and manufacturing processes 
were  the  same  as  in  the  (initial)  supportive  pharmacokinetic  bioequivalence  study  at  the 
middle strength (study BFS-AS-104). 
CHMP assessment report

Based  on  the  outcome  of  this  pilot  study  (study  BFS-BE-110),  the  pivotal  pharmacokinetic 
studies  at  the  high  and  middle  strengths  were  set  up  using  the  proposed  changed/modified 
micronisation  process  to  the  larger,  coarser  particle  size.  Both  studies  confirmed  that  this 
change  resulted  in  some  slight  lowering  of  Cmax,  in  the  absence  of  charcoal  blockade,  for 
both  formoterol  fumarate  (as  required  from  earlier  study  results)  and  budesonide  in  BF 
Spiromax  such  that  bioequivalence  between  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  was 
demonstrated for all comparisons. 
The  studies  with  the  low  strength  were  carried  out  using  the  original  drug  micronisation 
specifications and in the pivotal study (study BFS-AS-103) in both the absence of and in the 
presence of a charcoal blockade. Cmax for formoterol fumarate was higher  for BF  Spiromax 
than for Symbicorrt Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios were not within the accepted 
range  for  bioequivalence.  The  Applicant  expected  that  the  use  of  the  proposed  modified 
micronisation  process  to  the  larger,  coarser  particle  size  would  have  a  similar  effect  to  that 
seen with the high and middle strengths with some slight lowering of Cmax for both actives 
such  that  all  comparisons between  BF  Spiromax  80/4.5  µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler 100/6 
µg  would  demonstrate  bioequivalence.  However,  the  modification  of  the  micronisation 
process  resulted  in  a  lowering  of  the  CIs  not  only  for  formoterol  fumarate  but  also  for 
budesonide and for the middle strength product, with the exception of Cmax without charcoal 
for  formoterol  fumarate.  The  CIs  did  not include  unity.  The  pharmacokinetic  data  generated 
were  consistently  lower  for  BF  Spiromax  than  for  the  reference  product,  Symbicort 
Turbohaler, particularly for budesonide. The Applicant explained that the batches of the test 
and reference products used in this study differed within their specification range. The in vitro 
performance of the BF Spiromax batch was inferior to that of the Symbicort Turbohaler batch 
with regards to FPD. 
Study BFS-BE-108 (n=90) – fifth pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study – a pivotal 
study at the middle strength 
This  was  another  single-centre,  open-label,  randomised,  five-period  crossover,  single  dose 
study to assess the pharmacokinetic profiles of budesonide and formoterol fumarate following 
administration  of  BF  Spiromax  160/4.5µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  200/6µg  with  and 
without charcoal blockade. Subjects were randomised one of 10 treatment sequences and to 
ensure  consistency  all  dosing  occurred  between  08.00hours  and  10.00hours.  The  primary 
pharmacokinetic  endpoints  were  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  for  both  budesonide  and  formoterol 
fumarate for the PP population. A total of 90 subjects were randomised to treatment and 86 
subjects completed all five treatment periods. Eighty-eight subjects were included in the ITT 
and safety populations and 86 were included in the PP population. 
There were 4 subject-withdrawals during the study: 
•  Subject No. 3024 withdrew his consent on Period 1 Day 0 following randomisation 
and did not receive any randomised study medication. 
•  Subject No. 3029 was withdrawn from the study after taking randomised study 
medication on Period 1 Day 0 at the request of the Investigator due to a poor venous 
status. 
•  Subject No. 3040 was withdrawn from the study before dosing on Period 3 Day 0 due 
to the occurrence of a gastroenteritis reported as an AE. 
CHMP assessment report

•  Subject No. 3080 was withdrawn from the study on Period 1 Day 0 following 
randomisation and did not receive any randomised study medication due to the 
occurrence of vagal faintness and vomiting reported as AEs. 
Based  on  the  findings  of  the  pilot  study  (study  BFS-BE-110),  the  middle  strength  BF 
Spiromax product was modified also, by the use of the high strength formulation which was 
subsequently  filled  into  a  half-sized  dose  cup  device  and  by  a  change  in  the  micronisation 
process for the formoterol fumarate drug substance to produce a larger and coarser particle 
size.  All  other  components  and  manufacturing  processes  were  the  same  as  in  the  (initial) 
supportive pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study at the middle strength, (study BFS-AS-104) 
discussed above.

The results for the ITT population are virtually identical to those for the PP population. Both in 
the absence of and in the presence of a charcoal blockade bioequivalence was demonstrated 
for  AUC0-t,  Cmax  and  AUC0-inf  for  both  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate,  the  90%  CIs 
for the ratios were all within the accepted range for bioequivalence (0.8, 1.25).  
Confidence  intervals  generated  for  tmax  demonstrated  no  statistically  significant  difference 
between  the  products  in  terms  of  time  to  reach  either  peak  budesonide  or  peak  formoterol 
fumarate  concentrations  in  plasma  both  in  the  absence  and  in  the  presence  of  a  charcoal 
blockade.

In the pivotal study (study BFS-BE-108), the study in which BF Spiromax contained a mix of 
the same two active substances but employed a change in the micronisation process for the 
formoterol  fumarate  drug  substance  to  produce  a  larger  and  more  coarse  formoterol 
fumarate particle size, and used the high strength formulation with a half dose cup size, BF 
Spiromax  160/4.5µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  200/6µg  were  shown  to  be  bioequivalent  in 
respect  of  both  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  pharmacokinetic  parameters,  when 
administered both with and without charcoal blockade.

fumarate from two batches of BF Spiromax 80/4.5µg, each with a different fine particle dose 
(FPD) and from Symbicort Turbohaler 100/6µg.  
The study was a single-centre, open-label, single dose, three-way crossover and the primary 
pharmacokinetic endpoint was AUClast for both budesonide and formoterol fumarate. A total 
of 18 subjects were randomised to treatment and 16 subjects completed all three treatment 
periods.  All  18  subjects  were  included  in  the  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  analyses  and  17 
subjects were included in the inferential pharmacokinetic statistics.  
Statistical Comparisons PK Parameters for BUD in Study BFC-AS-102 
The systemic availability of plasma budesonide was higher for BF Symbicort Batch A than for 
Symbicort  Turbohaler  for  all  endpoints  based  on  the  90%  CI  for  the  ratios  not  being 
contained within (0.8, 1.25). For Batch B, the systemic availability was lower for BF Spiromax 
than for Symbicort Turbohaler for all endpoints also based on the 90% CI for  the ratios not 
being contained within (0.8, 1.25).

fumarate was comparable with Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CI for the ratio of AUClast 
was contained within (0.8, 1.25). For the secondary endpoint, AUC0-inf, the 90% CI for the 
ratio  was  contained  within(0.8,  1.25),  but  the  90%  CI  for  the  ratio  of  Cmax  was  slightly

(0.8,1.25).

Study BFS-AS-103 (n=88) – sixth pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study – a pivotal 
pharmacokinetic study at the low strength  
The pharmacokinetic study BFC-AS-102, compared two batches of low strength BF Spiromax 
80/4.5µg,  each  with  a  different  FPD,  with  Symbicort  Turbohaler  100/6µg.  Based  on  the  in 
vitro/in vivo relationship observed, Study BFS-AS-103 (a further pharmacokinetic study) was 
conducted  to  evaluate  whether  the  device  and  formulation  selected  for  BF  Spiromax  at  low 
strength could be shown to be equivalent to Symbicort Turbohaler.  
Study BFS-AS-103 was a single-centre, open-label, randomised, four-period crossover, single 
dose  study  to  compare  the  pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate 
following  administration  of  BF  Spiromax  80/4.5µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  100/6µg  with 
and  without  charcoal  blockade.  Subjects  were  randomised  to  receive  BF  Spiromax  or 
Symbicort Turbohaler without charcoal blockade in treatment periods 1 and 2 followed by BF 
Spiromax  or  Symbicort  Turbohaler  with  charcoal  blockade  in  treatment  periods  3  and  4  and 
to ensure consistency all dosing occurred between 06.00hours and 09.00hours. The primary 
pharmacokinetic  endpoints  were  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  for  both  budesonide  and  formoterol 
fumarate for the ITT population. A total of 88 subjects were randomised to treatment and 87 
subjects  completed  all  four  treatment  periods.  All  88  subjects  were  included  in  the  ITT  and 
safety populations. 
 Statistical Comparison of PK Parameters of BUD in Study BFS-AS-103 
(ITTpopulation) 
Both  in  the  absence  of  and  in  the  presence  of  a  charcoal  blockade  bioequivalence  was 
demonstrated  for  AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf  and  Cmax  for  budesonide  as  the  90%  CIs  for  the  ratios 
were all within the accepted range for bioequivalence (0.8, 1.25).  
Confidence intervals generated for tmax demonstrated no statistically significant difference

between  the  products  in  terms  of  time  to  reach  peak  budesonide  concentration  in  plasma 
both in the absence and in the presence of a charcoal blockade. 
Statistical Comparison of PK Parameters of FOR in Study BSF-AS-103 (ITT 
population) 
Both  in  the  absence  of  and  in  the  presence  of  a  charcoal  blockade  bioequivalence  was  only 
demonstrated  for  AUC0-t  and  AUC0-inf  for  formoterol  fumarate,  the  90%  CIs  for  the  ratios 
were all within the accepted range for bioequivalence (0.8, 1.25).  
In the absence of and in the presence of a charcoal blockade, Cmax for formoterol fumarate 
was higher for BF Spiromax than for Symbicort Turbohaler. The 90% CIs for the ratios were 
not within the accepted range for bioequivalence. In the absence of a charcoal blockade 90% 
CIs were 1.13, 1,26, in the presence of a charcoal blockade they were 1.30, 1.46. 
Confidence  intervals  generated  for  tmax  demonstrated  no  statistically  significant  difference 
between  the  products  in  terms  of  time  to  reach  peak  formoterol  fumarate  concentration  in 
plasma both in the absence and in the presence of a charcoal blockade.

In  the  pivotal  study,  Study  BFS-AS-103,  BF  Spiromax  80/4.5µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler 
100/6µg  were  shown  to  be  bioequivalent  in  respect  of  budesonide  pharmacokinetic 
parameters, when administered both with and without charcoal blockade. 
For  formoterol  fumarate  pharmacokinetic  parameters  in  respect  of  AUC,  bioequivalence  was 
shown  when  BF  Spiromax  80/4.5µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  100/6µg  were  administered 
both  with  and  without  charcoal  blockade.  However  peak/maximum  plasma  concentration, 
Cmax, was slightly higher following administration of BF Spiromax compared with Symbicort 
turbohaler, both with and without charcoal blockade.

Pharmacokinetic  bioequivalence  for  budesonide,  with  and  without  charcoal  blockade  was 
observed for all strengths with the exception of two of the supportive studies: 
• 
the  high  strength  supportive  study  (study  BFS-AS-105)  (n=88)  – 
initial 
pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study – this was considered by the Applicant to be a 
spurious result and out-of-line with other pharmacokinetic studies presented  
and  
• 
the  middle  strength  supportive  study  (study  BFS-AS-104)  (n=90)  –  fourth 
pharmacokinetic  bioequivalence  study  –  the  findings  in  this  study  resulted  in  a

change  in  the  micronisation  process  for  formoterol  fumarate  and  a  change  in  the 
grade  of  lactose,  with  subsequent  modification  of  both  the  high  strength  and  the 
middle  strength  products  by  inclusion  of  coarser  formoterol  fumarate  particles  (see 
study BFS-BE-110). 
Data from food-interaction studies 
No  food  effect  studies  have  been  submitted.  This  is  acceptable  since  the  clinical 
pharmacology  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  has  been  investigated  extensively  in 
the past, is well known and has been the subject of many publications. The development of 
these  new  fixed-dose  combination  OIP  aims  to  demonstrate  therapeutic  equivalence  of  this 
new  products  to  appropriate  reference  products  and  the  development  is  based  on  the 
demonstration  of  pharmacokinetic  and/or  pharmacodynamic  equivalence  between  each 
strength of this fixed-dose combination, BF Spiromax and the corresponding strength of the 
reference product, Symbicort Turbohaler.  
There  are  no  known  relevant  interactions  between  either  of  these  actives,  budesonide  and 
formoterol fumarate and food intake and no adverse effects of food on the rate and/or extent 
of absorption of either active. 
Budesonide undergoes extensive first pass hepatic biotransformation, approximately 90%, to 
metabolites  of  low  glucocorticoid  activity  (less  that  1%  of  that  of  budesonide);  formoterol 
fumarate is inactivated by conjugation. 
Distribution 
No  studies  have  been  submitted,  which  is  acceptable  since  the  clinical  pharmacology  of 
budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  has  been  investigated  extensively  in  the  past,  is  well 
known and has been the subject of many publications. The development of these new fixed-
dose  combination  OIPs  aims  to  demonstrate  therapeutic  equivalence  of  these  new  products 
to  appropriate  reference  products  and  the  development  is  based  on  the  demonstration  of 
pharmacokinetic  and/or  pharmacodynamic  equivalence  between  each  strength  of  this  fixed-
dose  combination,  BF  Spiromax  and  the  corresponding  strength  of  the  reference  product, 
Symbicort Turbohaler.  
Elimination 
There is no discussion and no studies have been submitted. This is acceptable for the same 
reasons stated above for lack of distribution studies.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In  vitro  performance  for  formoterol  fumarate  is  the  same  for  the  middle  and  low  strength 
products  and  dose  proportionality  for  formoterol  fumarate  between  the  middle  and  low 
strength  products  compared  with  the  high  strength  has  been  established.  The  specifications 
of FPD and delivered dose of the middle and low strength products are in line with the high 
strength product. 
However,  there  is  a  lack  of  an  in  vitro/in  vivo  correlation  between  the  low  strength  product 
compared with the middle and the high strength products, due to differences in lactose grade 
and dosing cup size between the three strengths.  
Section 2.4.4 ‘Discussion on clinical pharmacology’ contains further details on the Applicant’s 
justification for bridging the in vivo data generated from one strength to another lower 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 63/117 
 
  
  
strength and on the modification of the micronisation process for the formoterol fumarate 
drug substance. 
Special populations 
No studies in special populations have been submitted, which is acceptable for the same 
reasons as for the lack of data on distribution and elimination. The adults recruited in the 
clinical programme presented (a total of nine pharmacokinetic studies and one 
pharmacodynamic study) were healthy volunteers. No clinical studies have been submitted in 
adults or adolescents with asthma or in patients with COPD. 
The CHMP Guideline on orally inhaled products (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) states that 
“Unless justified otherwise, comparative in vitro data on flow rate dependence should be 
obtained with a range of flow rates. This range should be justified in relation to the intended 
patient population. The minimum (e.g. 10th percentile), median and maximum (e.g. 90th 
percentile) achievable flow rate in this patient population(s) should be investigated.” 
Taking the above into account, the Applicant submitted data on the inhalation characteristics 
of healthy adult volunteers (aged 18 to 45 years), adults (18 to 45 years), adolescents 12 to 
17 years) and children (6 to 11 years) with asthma and adults over 50 years of age with 
COPD in order to bridge the findings in the clinical pharmacology studies in healthy 
volunteers to the target patient populations in whom this fixed-dose combination product will 
be used. This data aimed at showing the appropriateness of the pharmacokinetic findings 
obtained in healthy volunteers to support equivalence in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease and in other populations with low inspiratory capacity, taking into account 
the differences in in vitro flow rates for all three strengths at low flow rates and differences in 
peak inspiratory flow rates between healthy volunteers and the different patient populations 
in whom this fixed-dose combination will be used. It was a study of peak inspiratory flow 
rates (PIFR) generated from the proposed Spiromax device and the Turbohaler device by 
various patient groups (pre- and post-enhanced device training). Four patient groups were 
included in the study as follows (n=50 in each of the four study groups listed): 
1.  Children and adolescents with asthma aged 6-17 years 
2.  Adults with asthma aged 18-45 years 
3.  Adults with COPD aged >50 years 
4.  Healthy volunteers aged 18-45 years 
Overall results obtained from this study were presented as follows:

•  Healthy volunteers and patients were able to generate a slightly higher inspiratory flow 
rate from the Spiromax device than from the Turbohaler device.

• 
• 
• 
• 
In asthma, the 10th percentile was equal to or greater than 50L/min in children, 
adolescents and adults using both inhalation devices. 
In COPD, the 10th percentile was approx. 40L/min through both devices. 
The PIFR 90th percentile was between 84-105L/min for all patient groups (asthma and 
COPD). 
The PIFR 50th percentile was between 60-88L/min for all patient groups (asthma and 
COPD). 
Few subjects had a mean PIFR below 40L/min – with no clustering by age or asthma 
severity (as defined by the measurement of forced expiratory volume in one second 
(FEV1) percent predicted 
There was little difference in PIFR between adolescents and adults with asthma with 
either device. 
•  With both devices there was a slight trend towards higher PIFR with increasing age in 
children with asthma and only one patient had a PIFR below 40 L/min, with no evidence 
of clustering at the lower ages. 
Aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) was evaluated over 40, 60 and 90 L/min for all 
three proposed strengths of the finished product.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  in  vitro/in  vivo  studies  have  been  submitted  for  the  same  reason  as  above.  Interactions 
with other medicinal products are well known and well documented.  
There  are  no  known  indications  of  any  relevant  metabolic  interactions  or  any  displacement 
reactions  between  either  of  these  actives,  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate,  neither  in 
vitro nor in vivo. 
Budesonide undergoes extensive first pass hepatic biotransformation, approximately 90%, to 
metabolites  of  low  glucocorticoid  activity  (less  that  1%  of  that  of  budesonide);  formoterol 
fumarate is inactivated by conjugation. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Budesonide  is  an  orally  inhaled  glucocorticosteroid with  high  local  anti-inflammatory  activity 
and  a  lower  incidence  of  adverse  effects  than  is  seen  with  oral  corticosteroids.  Budesonide 
has  been  shown  to  decrease  airways  reactivity  to  histamine  and  methacholine  in  patients 
with hyperreactive airways. Inhaled budesonide is recommended for use in the management 
of patients with asthma.  
Formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  is  a  selective  long-acting  β2  adrenergic  agonist  and  exerts  a 
preferential  effect  on  β2  adrenergic  receptors  on  bronchial  smooth  muscle  to  produce 
relaxation  and  bronchodilatation.  Formoterol  is  used  via  the  orally  inhaled  route  in  the 
management  of  patients  with  reversible  airways  obstruction.  Formoterol  produces 
bronchodilation  within  1-3  minutes  following  inhalation,  which  lasts  for  12  hours  following  a 
single  dose.  Formoterol  is  particularly  useful  in  patients  with  reversible  airways  obstruction 
who  continue  to  experience  symptoms  despite  treatment  with  an  anti-inflammatory  agent 
such  as  an  inhaled  corticosteroid.  Guidelines  for  the  management  of  reversible  airways 
obstruction  and  particularly  asthma  recommend  the  addition  of  a  long-acting  β2  agonist  to 
the treatment regimen in these patients and studies have shown that the addition of a long-
acting  β2  agonist  provides  better  control  of  asthma  than  increasing  the  dose  of  inhaled 
corticosteroid. 
The  mechanisms  of  action  of  the  two  drugs,  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate 
are different but complementary. Budesonide and formoterol fumarate demonstrate additive 
effects. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The  CHMP  Guideline  on  orally  inhaled  products  (CHMP/EWP/4151/00  Rev.  1)  describes  the 
development  of  an  OIP  for  use  in  the  management  of  asthma  and  COPD,  including  the 
development of a new OIP where demonstration of therapeutic equivalence to a well-known 
and  established  reference  product  is  required,  as  a  cascade  of  development  from  in  vitro 
characterisation through pharmacokinetic studies to pharmacodynamic and/or clinical studies, 
as required.  
As  small  differences  were  detected  in  Cmax  for  formoterol  fumarate  between  the  low 
strengths  of  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler,  the  low  strength  was  included  in  a 
single  pharmacodynamic  study  (study  BFS-AS-106)  conducted  to  evaluate  whether  the 
pharmacokinetic  differences  seen  in  Cmax  were  associated  with  greater  extrapulmonary 
effects of formoterol fumarate from BF Spiromax when compared with Symbicort Turbohaler.

Study BFS-AS-106: A randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, cumulative dose, 
four-period crossover study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of 
Budesonide/Formoterol Spiromax Inhalation Powder and Symbicort Turbohaler 
administered in healthy volunteers (n=56 randomised) 
This was a phase I single centre, cumulative dose study carried out in the UK. 
-  Primary  Objective:  The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  the  pharmacodynamic 
(extrapulmonary)  effects  of  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  following  cumulative 
delivered  doses  of  36µg  and  72µg  of  formoterol  administered  as  1+1+2+4  inhalations  of 
budesonide/formoterol  fumarate  80/4.5µg  (delivered  dose)  per  inhalation  and  1+1+2+4 
inhalations  of  budesonide/formoterol  fumarate  320/9µg  (delivered  dose)  per  inhalation,  in 
healthy volunteers aged 18 to 45 years. 
-  Secondary  Objective:  The  secondary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  BF  Spiromax 
and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  following  cumulative  delivered  doses  of  formoterol  fumarate  of 
36µg and 72µg. 
All  subjects  had  to  complete  a  training  period  over  two  consecutive  days,  prior  to  entering 
the  treatment  phase  of  the  study.  The  study  assessed  when  they  learnt  how  to  use  the  BF 
Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  devices,  as  well  as  the  tolerability  to  the  two  drug 
substances, budesonide and formoterol fumarate.  
A 5- to 8-day wash-out period followed training prior to the commencement of the treatment 
phase and each of the four treatment days was separated from the next by a similar 5- 8-day 
wash-out. There were six clinic visits, including the screening and training days/visits and the 
total study duration for each subject was between 6 and 8 weeks. 
The  study  saw  recruitment  of  male  and  female  healthy  volunteers,  aged  18  to  45  years, 
inclusive and in good general health. 
Criteria for evaluation: 
-  Primary  pharmacodynamic  endpoint:  Change  from  baseline  in  corrected  QT  interval  using 
the Fridericia correction formula (QTcF) (msec) at 5 minutes after each of the four cumulative 
doses. 
- Secondary pharmacodynamic endpoints: 
•  Change from baseline in QTcF interval (msec) at 15 minutes after each of the four 
cumulative doses. 
•  Change from baseline in corrected QT interval using the Bazzett correction formula 
(QTcB) (msec) at 5 minutes after each of the four cumulative doses. 
•  Change from baseline in QTcB interval (msec) at 15 minutes after each of the four 
cumulative doses. 
•  Baseline corrected QTcF AUC0-4hr following the administration of the last cumulative 
dose.

-  Symbicort  Turbohaler  400/12µg  (budesonide  400µg  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate 
12µg  inhalation  powder  per  metered  dose);  cumulative  metered  dose  of  96µg  of  formoterol 
administered  as  1+1+2+4  inhalations  with  29,  28,  and  26  minutes  between  each  set 
following the first inhalation set 
Number of subjects: 
Planned: Randomise 56 (14 per sequence) to ensure 52 (13 per sequence) evaluable 
Analysed: Screened 124, randomised: 56, completed 52 
All 56 subjects were included in the safety, ITT and PP analyses. 
Treatment phase: 
The  randomly  assigned  treatment  was  administered  by  cumulative  dosing  of  1+1+2+4 
inhalations from each device on each of the four study treatment days and on each study day 
serial  pharmacodynamic  assessments  (ECG,  vital  signs,  glucose  and  potassium)  were 
measured  prior  to  and  following  dosing  which  was  then  followed  by  a  5-  to  8-day  washout 
period between treatments. 
Statistical methods: 
The  primary  pharmacodynamic  analysis  was  based  upon  a  comparison  of  BF  Spiromax  and 
Symbicort Turbohaler with respect to the primary pharmacodynamic endpoint. The following 
treatments were compared: 
Low  strength:  Treatment  A  (BF  Spiromax  80/4.5µg)  versus  Treatment  B  (Symbicort 
Turbohaler 100/6µg) 
High  strength:  Treatment  C  (BF  Spiromax  320/9µg)  versus  Treatment  D  (Symbicort 
Turbohaler 400/12µg) 
The following null and alternative hypotheses were used: 
H0:  |µSpiromax  -  µSymbicort|  >10msec,  for  at  least  one  of  the  cumulative  doses  at  either 
the low or high strength 
versus 
H1:  |Spiromax  -  _Symbicort|  ≤10msec,  for  all  cumulative  doses  at  both  the  low  and  high 
strengths 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 71/117 
 
 
 
  
  
where µSpiromax and µSymbicort represent the mean change from baseline in QTcF interval 
at 5 minutes after a given cumulative dose at a given strength. 
The  alternative  hypothesis  that  the  absolute  difference  in  means  is  less  than  10msec  was 
concluded  only if  each  of the  individual  null  hypotheses  was  rejected.  Each  of  the  individual 
hypotheses  was  tested  by  rejecting  the  null  hypothesis  if  the  90%  CI  for  the  difference  in 
device  means  was  contained  within  the  equivalence  bounds  ±10msec  controlling  alpha  at 
0.05 for each test. 
Therefore BF Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler were declared equivalent for each strength 
if  the  90%  CIs  for  the  difference  in  treatment  means  for  the  change  from  baseline  in  QTcF 
interval at 5 minutes after each cumulative dose were all within the limits ±10msec.  
The primary analysis for the hypotheses described above was conducted using a mixed-effect 
ANCOVA model with baseline (pre-dose) QTcF interval as covariate, fixed effects of sequence, 
period,  treatment  (i.e.,  device),  cumulative  dose  within  treatment  and  random  effects  for 
subject within sequence and period by subject within sequence. 
The  secondary  pharmacodynamic  endpoints  were  analysed  using  the  same  method  as  the 
one described above for the primary pharmacodynamic endpoint. 
Safety 
Each  adverse  event  was  classified  using  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA).  The  overall  incidence  of  adverse  events,  as  well  the  incidence  of  TEAEs,  serious 
adverse  events  (SAEs),  drug-related  adverse  events  and  adverse  events  leading  to 
withdrawal, were summarised by treatment group, body system and preferred MedDRA term. 
Prior  and  concomitant  medication  were  coded  according  to  the  World  Health  Organisation-
Drug  Dictionary  (WHO-DD)  and  the  Anatomical  Therapeutic  Chemical  (ATC)  classification 
system.  Changes  in  the  physical  examinations,  clinical  laboratory  findings,  ECGs,  and  vital 
signs (blood pressure and HR from pre- to post-study were also summarised. 
Other (Inspiratory flow rate): 
A  listing  of  inspiratory  flow  rate  was  provided  by  subject  and  study  time  point  and  includes 
changes  from  baseline.  Absolute  values  as  well  as  changes  from  baseline  were  also 
summarised descriptively. 
Findings: 
Low Strength Comparison   
The  differences  in  mean  change  from  baseline  in  QTcF,  QTcB,  and  the  uncorrected  QT 
intervals  were  comparable  between  the  two  low  strength  products  following  each  dosing 
administration for both the 5 and 15 minute post-dose assessments (see table below).  
The 90% CIs for the difference in mean change from baseline in QTcB, QTcF and uncorrected 
QT intervals for the BF Spiromax 80/4µg compared with Symbicort Turbohaler 100/6µg at 5 
minutes and 15 minutes after each of the four cumulative doses are contained within the pre-
specified equivalence  bounds  ±10msec.  In  most  instances,  the  90%  CI  for  the  comparisons 
between  these  two  low  strength  products  included  the  value  of  zero  indicating  that 
differences were not statistically significant.  
The  90%  CIs  for  the  difference  in  maximum  change  from  baseline  after  the  last  cumulative 
dose and standardized area under the curve between 0 and 4 hours (AUC0-4) for QTcB, QTcF

and uncorrected QT intervals for BF Spiromax 80/4.5µg and Symbicort Turbohaler 100/6µg, 
are also contained within the equivalence bounds ±10msec. 
For  the  secondary  pharmacodynamic  variables,  HR  (measured  both  from  vital  signs  and 
ECG), SBP, DBP, blood glucose and serum potassium, all observed differences were small and 
in  the  opinion  of  the  Applicant,  not  clinically  meaningful.  In  most  instances,  the  90%  CI  for 
the  comparisons  between  the  test  and  reference  products  included  the  value  of  zero  and 
were not statistically significant.

High Strength Comparison 
The 90% CI for the difference in mean change from baseline in QTcB and QTcF intervals for 
the high strength treatments at 5 minutes and 15 minutes after each of the four cumulative 
doses are contained within the pre-specified equivalence bounds ±10msec (see table below). 
In  most  instances,  the  90%  CI  for  the  comparisons  between  BF  Spiromax  320/9µg  and 
Symbicort  Turbohaler  400/12µg  included  the  value  of  zero  indicating  that  differences  were 
not statistically significant.  
The 90% CIs for the difference in mean change from baseline in the uncorrected QT interval 
for  the  high  strength  treatments  were  (-12.788,  -5.605)  at  5  minutes  after  the  last 
cumulative  dose,  (-10.928,  -3.581)  at  15  minutes  after  the  third  cumulative  dose,  and         
(-12.262,  -4.920)  at  15  minutes  after  the  last  cumulative  dose.  All  other  90%  CIs  at  5 
minutes and 15 minutes were contained within the equivalence bounds ±10msec. 
The  90%  CIs  for  the  difference  in  maximum  change  from  baseline  after  the  last  cumulative 
dose and standardised AUC0-4 for QTcB, QTcF and uncorrected QT intervals for BF Spiromax 
320/9µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  400/12µg  are  contained  within  the  equivalence  bounds 
±10msec. 
For  the  secondary  pharmacodynamic  variable  of  HR  the  observed  differences  between  the 
two high strength treatments at 5 minutes and 15 minutes after each of the four cumulative 
doses were small (approximately 3 beats per minute (bpm) or less) at the therapeutic doses 
of  formoterol  fumarate  (i.e.,  a  delivered  dose  of  ≤18µg  of  formoterol)  and  in the  opinion of 
the  Applicant  were  not  thought  to  be  clinically  meaningful.  At  supra-therapeutic  doses  of 
formoterol fumarate (i.e., a delivered dose of ≥36µg of formoterol), the observed differences 
in  heart  rate,  as  well  as  in  maximum  change  from  baseline  and  standardized  AUC0-4,  were 
again small (approximately 6 bpm or less for heart rate from vital signs and approximately 4 
bpm or  less  for  heart  rate  from  the  ECG).  The  difference  between  treatments for  heart  rate 
from  the  ECG  did  not  reach  the  clinically  meaningful  threshold  of  5  bpm  even  at  supra-
therapeutic formoterol doses. 
For  the  secondary  pharmacodynamic  variable  of  blood  glucose  the  observed  differences  in 
glucose  measurements  between  BF  Spiromax  320/9µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  400/12µg 
were  small  (approximately  0.1  mmol/L  or  below)  at  therapeutic  doses  of  formoterol 
fumararte  (i.e.,  a  delivered  dose  of  formoterol  of  ≤18µg)  and  not  clinically  meaningful.  At 
therapeutic  doses,  the  90%  CI  for  the  comparisons  between  BF  Spiromax  320/9µg  and 
Symbicort  Turbohaler  400/12µg  included  zero  and  the  differences  were  not  statistically 
significant.  While  greater  effects  with  BF  Spiromax  320/9µg  were  observed  at  supra-
therapeutic doses of formoterol (i.e., a delivered dose of formoterol of ≥36µg), the observed 
differences in glucose measurements, as  well as in  the maximum change from baseline and 
standardised AUC0-4, did not exceed approximately 0.3-0.4 mmol/L. 
For  the  secondary  pharmacodynamic  variables,  SBP  and  DBP  (and  in  most  instances,  the 
90% CI for the comparisons between the test and reference products included zero and were 
not statistically significant) and serum potassium, all observed differences were small and in 
the opinion of the Applicant, not clinically meaningful.

   Comparison of QT Intervals After the High Doses in Study BFS-AS-106 (PP population) 
According to the Applicant, based on the results of this pharmacodynamic study, low strength 
BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  showed  to  be  equivalent  as  defined  in  the  protocol. 
Therefore the small pharmacokinetic differences in Cmax for formoterol fumarate observed in 
the  pivotal  pharmacokinetic  study  (study  BFS-AS-103)  were  not  associated  with  clinically 
meaningful pharmacodynamic differences.  
A higher formoterol Cmax was observed with all three strengths for BF Spiromax (low, middle 
and  high)  compared  with  Symbicort  Turbohaler.  As  explained 
in  section  2.4.2 
‘Pharmacodynamics’,  subsequent  further  in  vitro  evaluation  of  BF  Spiromax  aiming  at

achieving  pharmacokinetic  bioequivalence  for  formoterol  fumarate  Cmax  suggested  that  a 
change in the micronisation process for the formoterol fumarate drug substance, such that a 
larger  particle  would  be  produced,  might  help  achieve  bioequivalence  for  all  formoterol 
fumarate comparisons. This hypothesis was tested and validated in the pilot pharmacokinetic 
study  carried  out  with  the  middle  strengths  of  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  (see 
study BFS-BE-110).  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  has  been  investigated 
extensively  in  the  past,  is  well  known  and  has  been  the  subject  of  many  publications.  The 
development  of  these  new  fixed-dose  combination  OIPs  aims  to  demonstrate  therapeutic 
equivalence of these new products to appropriate reference products and the development is 
based  on  the  demonstration  of  pharmacokinetic  and/or  pharmacodynamic  equivalence 
between  each  strength  of  this  fixed-dose  combination,  BF  Spiromax  and  the  corresponding 
strength of the reference product, Symbicort Turbohaler.  
The  Applicant  initially  requested  indications  for  use  in  adults  and  adolescents  with  asthma 
and in adults with COPD. The clinical dossier comprises nine pharmacokinetic studies and one 
pharmacodynamic study, all carried out in male and female healthy volunteers, aged between 
18  and  45  years  and  one  pharmacodynamic  study  in  children  with  asthma,  aged  6  to  11 
years. 
The study design with recruitment of healthy adult male and female volunteers, the sampling 
schedules,  pharmacokinetic  endpoints  and  analyses  for  comparison  of  all  pharmacokinetic 
profiles are acceptable for studies of this type.  
The CHMP Guideline on orally inhaled products (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) does state that 
pharmacokinetic studies should be carried out in the intended patient population. However, it 
is  considered  that  healthy  adult  volunteers  without  the  bronchoconstriction  of  asthma  and 
who  are 
less  variable  are  more  discriminative 
than  patients  with  asthma,  as 
bronchoconstriction  of  the  airways  in  the  patient  with  asthma  may  result  in  greater  central 
pulmonary deposition and two inhaled products then appearing to be more similar that they 
actually  are.  Furthermore  although  the  expiratory  capacity  in  patients  with  asthma  is 
compromised, the inspiratory capacity is much less so and generally similar to that of healthy 
volunteers. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the recruitment of healthy volunteers in the 
bioequivalence studies described is acceptable. 
The  Applicant  submitted  additional  data  on  the  inhalation  characteristics  of  healthy  adult 
volunteers,  adults,  adolescents  and  children  with  asthma  and  adults  over  50  years  of  age 
with  COPD  in  order  to  bridge  the  findings  in  the  clinical  pharmacology  studies  in  healthy 
volunteers to the target patient populations in whom this fixed-dose combination product will 
be  used.  Although  the  elderly  were  not  studied  per  se,  the  inhalation  characteristics  in 
patients  with  COPD  and  over  50  years  of  age  were  and  this  is  acceptable  in  the  lack  of  a 
specific study of the elderly over 65 years of age. 
The CHMP concluded the following: 
•  Regarding  the  use  in  COPD,  it  would  appear  that  regardless  of  age  and  underlying 
disease  severity,  children,  adolescents  and  adults  with  asthma,  as  well  as  patients 
with COPD can  achieve inspiratory flow rates through both the Spiromax device and 
Turbohaler device.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 77/117 
 
  
  
•  While flow through both devices was lower in patients with asthma or COPD relative 
to  healthy  volunteers,  the  mean  PIFR  achieved  by  asthma  and  COPD  patients  was 
over  60  L/min,  flow  rates  at  which  the  Spiromax  device  and  the  Turbohaler  device 
are  known  to  deliver  comparable  amounts  of  drug  to  the  lungs  (pharmacokinetic 
studies  with  the  high  strength  and  middle  strength  products,  Study  BFS-BE-109 
(pivotal  study)  and  Study  BFS-BE-108  (pivotal  study),  respectively)  and  at  which 
optimal drug deposition in the lung is achieved with the Turbohaler device. 
•  Very  few  patients  had  PIFRs  below 40  L/min.  When  PIFRs  were  less  than  40  L/min 
there appeared to be no clustering by age or disease severity. 
In the lack of appropriate clinical data in children, the requirement of Section 9 of the CHMP 
Guideline  on  orally  inhaled  products  (CHMP/EWP/4151/00  Rev.  1)  in  respect  of  the 
interpolation  from  data  generated  in  adults in  the  light  of  specific  studies  in  children  having 
been carried out, which states: “For adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years, interpolation 
from data generated in studies in adults may be possible if specific studies have been carried 
out  in  children  less  than  12  years  of  age.    If  this  is  not  possible  a  sufficient  number  of 
adolescents  should  be  recruited  to  the  adult  studies  such  that  the  entire  age  range  of 
intended use (12 years through to the elderly) has been studied.  Stratification into a 12 to 
17  years  age  group  and  18  years  and  above  is  not  necessarily  required;  however  data 
generated  (both  efficacy  and  safety  data)  from  the  two  age  groups  should  be  documented 
and  analysed  separately,  if  possible.  If  studies  have  not  been  carried  out  in  children  (less 
than 12 years of age) authorisation in adolescents may require the generation of clinical data 
in the adolescent as a specific sub-population…” cannot be met. Therefore at this stage in the 
development of this fixed-dose combination product, as neither children nor adolescents have 
been studied appropriately in the development programme submitted with these applications, 
the CHMP recommended that the this product should not be authorised for use in adolescents 
at this time and that the lower limit of the age range for use of this fixed-dose combination 
should  be  18  years.  As  the  reference  product,  containing  the  same  drug  substances,  is 
authorised for use in adolescents there is a sizeable risk, as there is with children 12 years of 
age and younger, that this new product will also be used “off-licence” in adolescents. In order 
to mitigate this risk, sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
state that DuoResp Spiromax is indicated in adults 18 years and above only and in addition 
section 4.2 states that DuoResp Spiromax is not indicated for use in children, 12 years of age 
and  younger  or  adolescents,  13  to  17  years  of  age.  The  package  leaflet  has  been  updated 
accordingly. 
The  CHMP  recommended  that  further  development  of  this  new  fixed-dose  combination 
product  in  children  and  adolescents  should  be  considered  particularly  in  the  light  of  this 
combination  containing  an  inhaled  corticosteroid.  In  addition,  the  CHMP  recommended  that 
demonstration  of  therapeutic  equivalence  in  respect  of  both  efficacy  and  safety  and  an 
appropriate  benefit/risk  balance  in  this  age  group  should  be  demonstrated  should  the 
Applicant seek approval of the lower strength fixed-dose combination in the future. 
Although  the  original  middle  strength  study,  Study  BFS-AS-104,  ultimately  designated  a 
supportive  study,  failed  to  demonstrate  pharmacokinetic  bioequivalence  in  any  of  the 
pharmacokinetic  comparisons,  the  relative  difference  between  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort 
Turbohaler was disproportionally greater for formoterol fumarate Cmax and this was seen for 
all three strengths. This consistency was seen across strengths. 
The  Applicant  claimed  the  low  strength  product  (80/4.5µg)  using  the  proposed  modified 
micronisation  process  to  the  larger,  coarser  particle  size,  without  conducting  a  further 
CHMP assessment report

pharmacokinetic study. The Applicant based this decision on the in vitro performance of the 
three  strengths,  extrapolation  from  the  high  and  middle  strength  pivotal  studies  (studies 
BFS-BE-109  and  BFS-BE-108,  respectively),  and  the  consistency  seen  across  the  three 
strengths  in  respect  of  the  device,  formulation  and  manufacturing  process  (except  for  the 
differences in lactose grade and dosing cup size between the three strengths). 
 In vitro performance for formoterol fumarate was the same for the middle and low strength 
products  and  dose  proportionality  for  formoterol  fumarate  between  the  middle  and  low 
strength  products  compared  with  the  high  strength  has  been  established.  The  specifications 
of  FPD  and  delivered  dose  of  middle  and  low  strength  products  were  in  line  with  the  high 
strength product. 
However, there was a lack of an in vitro/in vivo correlation between the low strength product 
compared with the middle and the high strength products, due to differences in lactose grade 
and  dosing  cup  size  between  the  three  strengths.  The  lack  of  a  pharmacokinetic  study  with 
the low strength product is not considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The  Applicant  stated  that  the  approach  of  bridging  the  in  vivo  data  generated  from  one 
strength  to  another  lower  strength  based  only  on  the  in  vitro  data  was  already  accepted  in 
the approval of a fixed-dose combination inhalation powder containing fluticasone propionate 
and salmeterol xinafoate (inhalation powder, pre-dispensed, 50/250 µg and 50/500 µg) and 
approved  at  national  level.  The  approval  of  this  product  was  based  on  the  in  vivo  data 
generated from a pharmacokinetic study with charcoal blockade using the 50/500µg product 
and  on  the  in  vitro  quality  data  in  the  absence  of  a pharmacokinetic  study  without  charcoal 
blockade  for  the  50/500µg  product  (and  without  a  pharmacokinetic  study  data  for  the 
50/250µg strength product).  
The  CHMP  considered  that  reference  to  another  previously  authorised  product  was  not  an 
acceptable  justification  for  the  Applicant’s  proposed  approach  to  bridge  in  vivo  data 
generated from one strength to another lower strength based only on the in vitro data. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  the  modification  of  the  micronisation  process  for  formoterol  fumarate 
drug substance, such that a larger particle is produced, resulted in a lowering of the CIs not 
only  for  formoterol  fumarate  but  also  for  budesonide  and  for  the  middle  strength  product, 
with the exception of Cmax without charcoal for formoterol fumarate. The CIs did not include 
unity. The pharmacokinetic data generated were consistently lower for BF Spiromax than for 
the reference product, Symbicort Turbohaler, particularly for budesonide.  
The in vitro performance of the BF Spiromax batch was inferior to the Symbicort Turbohaler 
batch  with  regards  to  FPD.  If  batches  of  the  two  products  which  were  more  similar  in  vitro 
characteristics had been used, unity might have been included in the confidence intervals.  
The CHMP therefore concluded that: 
• 
The two pivotal pharmacokinetic studies in the high strength (320/9 µg per dose) and 
the  middle  strength  (160/4.5  µg  per  dose),  carried  out  with  the  proposed  modified 
micronisation  process  to  the  larger,  coarser  particle  size,  demonstrated  equivalence 
between  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  for  all  comparisons  both  with  and 
without  a  charcoal  blockade.  The  change  in  the  micronisation  process  resulted  in 
some slight lowering of Cmax, in the absence of charcoal blockade, for both formoterol 
fumarate  (as  required  from  earlier  study  results)  and  budesonide  in  BF  Spiromax 
such that equivalence for all comparisons was shown. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 79/117 
 
  
  
•  With  regard  to  the  low  strength  product,  80/4.5  µg  per  dose,  the  Applicant  claimed 
this strength using the proposed modified micronisation process to the larger, coarser 
particle  size,  but  without  any  further  pharmacokinetic  study.  Instead  the  Applicant 
presents a pharmacodynamic systemic safety study to address the findings in the low 
strength pivotal pharmacokinetic study (Study BFS-AS-106). However, there is a lack 
of an in vitro/in vivo correlation between the low strength product compared with the 
middle and the high strength products, due to differences in lactose grade and dosing 
cup 
size  between 
the 
three 
strengths.  Therefore, 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study or other appropriate in vivo study with the 
low  strength  product  (80/4.5  µg  per  dose)  with  the  formulation  micronised  by  an 
alternative micronisation process resulting in larger and coarser particles, which was 
proposed as the final formulation for this low strength, was not considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
Given  the  lack  of  a  pharmacokinetic  study/other  clinical  study  to  conclusively  demonstrate 
the  equivalence  of  the low  strength  (80/4.5)  of  DuoResp  Spiromax  with  the low  strength  of 
the  reference  product,  the  Applicant  withdrew  the  lower  strength  of  this  fixed-dose 
combination. 
As  small  differences  were  detected  in  Cmax  for  formoterol  fumarate  between  the  low 
strengths  of  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  in  the  pharmacokinetic  study  (study 
BFS-AS-103),  the  low  strength  was  included  in  a  single  pharmacodynamic  study  (BFS-AS-
106)  conducted  to  evaluate  whether  the  pharmacokinetic  differences  seen  in  Cmax  were 
associated  with  greater  extrapulmonary  effects  of  formoterol  fumarate  from  BF  Spiromax 
when  compared  with  Symbicort  Turbohaler.  This  progression  through  pharmacokinetics  to  a 
pharmacodynamic  study(ies)  is  appropriate  and  in  line  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  orally 
inhaled products (CHMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1). 
The  study  design,  objectives  and  endpoints  of  Study  BFS-AS-106  are  acceptable  and  the 
findings  correlate  with  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  for  formoterol  fumarate  seen  in  the 
pharmacokinetic  studies  presented  in  respect  of  the  low  strength  (study  BFS-AS-103).  For 
the  majority  of  the  pharmacodynamic  endpoints  assessed  in  Study  BFS-AS-106,  greater 
changes  were  observed  in  the  measured  parameters  at  5 minutes  post-dose  than  at 
15 minutes  post-dose  which  fits  with  the  rapid  rise  and  fall  seen  in  formoterol  fumarate 
Cmax.  This  pattern  of  change  occurred  following  successively  higher  doses  up  to  the 
administration of  the  last cumulative  dose, indicating  that the  changes  in  pharmacodynamic 
measures  were  driven  by  administration  of  the  next  higher  dose  rather  than  by  carryover 
effects from the earlier, lower dose in the cumulative dosing. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  has  been  investigated 
extensively in the past, is well known and has been the subject of many publications.  
The study design with recruitment of healthy adult male and female volunteers, the sampling 
schedules,  pharmacokinetic  endpoints  and  analyses  for  comparison  of  all  pharmacokinetic 
profiles are acceptable for studies of this type.  
Although  the  elderly  were  not  studied  per  se,  the  inhalation  characteristics  in  patients  with 
COPD and over 50 years of age were and this is acceptable in the lack of a specific study of 
the elderly over 65 years of age.

At this stage in the development of this fixed-dose combination product, as neither children 
nor  adolescents  have  been  studied  appropriately  in  the  development  programme  submitted 
with this application, the CHMP recommended that the this product should not be authorised 
for use in adolescents at this time and that the lower limit of the age range for use of these 
fixed-dose  combinations  should  be  18  years.  The  applicant  agreed  to  update  the  product 
information accordingly. 
The  CHMP  recommended  that  further  development  of  this  new  fixed-dose  combination 
product  in  children  and  adolescents  should  be  considered  particularly  in  the  light  of  this 
combination  containing  an  inhaled  corticosteroid.  In  addition,  the  CHMP  recommended  that 
demonstration  of  therapeutic  equivalence  in  respect  of  both  efficacy  and  safety  and  an 
appropriate  benefit/risk  balance  in  this  age  group  should  be  demonstrated  should  the 
Applicant seek approval of the lower strength fixed-dose combination in the future. 
The  two  pivotal  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  the  high  strength  (320/9  µg  per  dose)  and  the 
middle strength (160/4.5 µg per dose), carried out with the proposed modified micronisation 
process to the larger, coarser particle size, demonstrated equivalence between BF Spiromax 
and Symbicort Turbohaler for all comparisons both with and without a charcoal blockade. The 
change in the micronisation process resulted in some slight lowering of Cmax, in the absence 
of  charcoal  blockade,  for  both  formoterol  fumarate  (as  required  from  earlier  study  results) 
and budesonide in BF Spiromax such that equivalence for all comparisons was shown. 
The  lack  of  an  in  vitro/in  vivo  correlation  between  the  low  strength  product  (80/4.5  µg  per 
dose) compared with the middle and the high strength products, due to differences in lactose 
grade and dosing cup size between the three strengths is of concern. Therefore, the lack of a 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  study  or  other  appropriate  in  vivo  studies  with  the  low 
strength  product  with  the  formulation  micronised  by  an  alternative  micronisation  process 
resulting in larger and coarser particles, which was proposed as the final formulation for this 
low strength, was not considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Given  the  lack  of  a  pharmacokinetic  study/other  clinical  study  to  conclusively  demonstrate 
the  equivalence  of  the low  strength  (80/4.5)  of  DuoResp  Spiromax with  the low  strength  of 
the  reference  product,  the  Applicant  withdrew  the  lower  strength  of  this  fixed-dose 
combination  and  stated  in  writing  that  they  will  provide  further  data  in  support  of  the  re-
formulated low strength in due course. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The  development  of  DuoResp  Spiromax  is  based  on  the  demonstration  of  pharmacokinetic 
equivalence  between  each  strength  of  this  fixed-dose  combination,  BF  Spiromax  and  the 
corresponding strength of the reference product, Symbicort Turbohaler. Nine pharmacokinetic 
studies and one pharmacodynamic study have been carried out in adults or adolescents.  
The  clinical  efficacy  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  has  been  investigated 
extensively, is well known and has been the subject of many publications.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  clinical  development  was  performed  in  line  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  orally  inhaled 
products  (CHMP/EWP/4151/00  Rev.  1).  The  clinical  development  of  BF  Spiromax  aims  to 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 81/117 
 
 
  
  
demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of this new product to the reference product authorised 
in a Member State or in the Community on the basis of a complete dossier. The development 
is based on the demonstration of pharmacokinetic equivalence between each strength of this 
fixed-dose  combination,  BF  Spiromax4  and  the  corresponding  strength  of  the  reference 
product, Symbicort Turbohaler.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The presence of clinical efficacy studies comparing the test and reference products in adults 
or  adolescents  is  not  required  since  the  clinical  efficacy  of  budesonide  and  formoterol 
fumarate  dihydrate  has  been  investigated  extensively,  is  well  known  and  has  been  the 
subject  of  many  publications.  Moreover,  this  is  in  line  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  orally 
inhaled products (CHMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) since equivalence has been demonstrated for 
the high strength (320/9 µg per dose) and the middle strength (160/4.5 µg per dose). 
The  two  pivotal  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  the  high  strength  (320/9  µg  per  dose)  and  the 
middle strength (160/4.5 µg per dose) demonstrated equivalence between BF Spiromax and 
Symbicort Turbohaler for all comparisons both with and without a charcoal blockade 
However the pharmacokinetic studies and other clinical studies presented were not sufficient 
to  conclusively  demonstrate  the  equivalence  of  the  low  strength  (80/4.5)  of  DuoResp 
Spiromax  with  the  low  strength  of  the  reference  product.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  withdrew 
the lower strength of this fixed-dose combination. 
There  is  no  conclusive  data  on  the  equivalence  of  DuoResp  Spiromax  with  the  reference 
product  in  children  and  adolescents  and  therefore  there  is  a  lack  of  demonstration  of  a 
positive  benefit/risk  balance  in  this  population.  Therefore,  the  applicant  agreed  to  limit  the 
use of DuoResp Spiromax to adults aged 18 and older. 
The  CHMP  recommended  that  further  development  of  this  new  fixed-dose  combination 
product in children and adolescents should be considered should the Applicant seek approval 
of  the  lower  strength  fixed-dose  combination.  In  addition,  the  CHMP  recommended  that 
demonstration  of  therapeutic  equivalence  in  respect  of  both  efficacy  and  safety  and  an 
appropriate  benefit/risk  balance  in  this  age  group  should  be  demonstrated  should  the 
Applicant seek approval of the lower strength fixed-dose combination in the future. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  clinical  safety  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  has  been  investigated 
extensively, is well known and has been the subject of many publications.  
The  Applicant  has  assessed  and  presented  the  safety  data  generated  in  the  clinical 
pharmacology studies presented in support of these applications. No Phase III safety studies 
in adults, including long-term safety studies, have been included in the submitted dossier. 
Systemic  effects  of  the  inhaled  corticosteroid,  budesonide,  have  been  assessed  in  children 
aged 6 to 11 years in study BFS-AS-305 (see below). Systemic effects of the long-acting β2 
agonist,  formoterol  fumarate  have  been  assessed  in  Study  BFS-AS-106  (see  section  2.4.3 
‘Pharmacodynamics’).

Patient exposure 
Overall, 628 healthy adult volunteers and 77 children with persistent asthma received at least 
one  dose  of  a  study  treatment  in  the  clinical  development  programme  presented  for  BF 
Spiromax.  
In  the  single  dose  pharmacokinetic  studies  268  subjects  received  the  high  strength  product 
(320/9µg per actuation), 198 received the middle strength product (160/4.5µg per actuation) 
and 106 received the low strength product (80/4.5µg per actuation).  
A  total  of  56  subjects  received  cumulative  doses  of  high  and  low  strength  products  in  the 
pharmacodynamic study. 
A total of 77 children aged 6 to 11 years received 2-weeks treatment with the low strength 
product in the Phase III safety study on this young age group. 
Adverse events 
The pharmacokinetic studies were all single dose crossover studies and provided very limited 
safety  data.  The  nature  and  intensity  of  AEs  for  BF  Spiromax  was  very  similar  to  that  for 
Symbicort  Turbohaler.  Headache  was  amongst  the  most  common  AEs  in  each  of  the 
pharnacokinetic studies. 
Study  BFS-AS-106  involved  cumulative  doses  of  36µg  and  72µg  of  formoterol  fumarate 
administered  as  1+1+2+4  inhalations  from  BF  Spiromax  80/4.5µg  per  inhalation  (delivered 
dose)  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  100/6µg  per  inhalation  (metered  dose)  and  1+1+2+4 
inhalations  from  BF  Spiromax  320/9µg  per  inhalation  (delivered  dose)  and  Symbicort 
Turbohaler 400/12µg per inhalation (metered dose).  
The AE profile in this study showed that nature and intensity of AEs for both strengths of BF 
Spiromax was similar to that of the corresponding strengths of Symbicort Turbohaler. Given 
the  cumulative  dose  design  of  this  study,  it  was  expected  that  there  would  be 
pharmacologically  predictable  AEs  (e.g.,  tremor,  palpitations)  with  both  BF  Spiromax  and 
Symbicort  Turbohaler,  especially  at  the  highest  cumulative  administered  doses.  However 
pharmacologically  predictable  AEs  occurred  infrequently  with  both  strengths  of  BF  Spiromax 
and Symbicort Turbohaler. The most common pharmacologically predictable AEs were tremor 
of the hand and dizziness. These occurred at similar frequencies with BF Spiromax relative to 
Symbicort Turbohaler with the exception of tremor of the hand, which occurred slightly more 
frequently with BF Spiromax 80/4.5µg (4 subjects) than with Symbicort Turbohaler 100/6µg 
(1 subject) but at a similar incidence with BF Spiromax 320/9µg (6 subjects) and Symbicort 
Turbohaler  400/12µg  (5  subjects).  Of  note,  the  pharmacologically  predictable  AEs  with  BF 
Spiromax  320/9µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  400/12µg  were  primarily  reported  following 
supra-therapeutic doses of formoterol (i.e., a delivered dose of formoterol of ≥ 36µg). 
Study  BFS-AS-305  was  the  only  repeat  dose  study  presented.  Prepubescent  children  with 
asthma  received  BF  Spiromax  80/4.5µg  (delivered  dose),  Symbicort  Turbohaler  100/6µg 
(metered  dose)  or  placebo  in  a  randomised,  double  blind  study.  Each  treatment  was 
administered as two inhalations in the morning and evening for 14 days. 
The  AE  profile  confirmed  a  similar  safety  profile  for  BF  Spiromax  80/4.5µg  and  Symbicort 
Turbohaler  100/6µg  with  8  (10.8%)  subjects  experiencing  at  least  one  AE  on  BF  Spiromax 
compared  with  6  subjects  (8.0%)  on  Symbicort  Turbohaler  and  11  subjects  (14.7%)  on 
placebo.  Cough  was  the  most  common  treatment-emergent  AE,  reported  for  1  subject 
(1.4%)  after  BF  Spiromax,  2  subjects  (2.7%)  after  Symbicort  Turbohaler  and  6  subjects 
(8.0%)  after  placebo.  All  other  AEs  were  isolated  occurrences  in  only  one  subject.  None  of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 83/117 
 
  
  
the treatment-emergent AEs reported during the study were considered treatment related. In 
addition there were no abnormal findings during the oropharyngeal examination at any  visit 
in any treatment group. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported. Two serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in Study BFS-
AS-305: 
•  One  subject  (Subject  0009)  experienced  gastroenteritis  during  BF  Spiromax 
80/4.5µg treatment; this SAE resolved after 2 days and was considered unrelated to 
study treatment.  
• 
The  second  subject  (Subject  0042)  experienced  an  asthma  exacerbation  during 
placebo treatment. This SAE caused the subject to discontinue and was ongoing at 
the final visit.  
One SAE was reported in Study BFS-BE-110: 
•  One  subject  (Subject  1012)  had  an  SAE  of  cranial  traumatism  with  loss  of 
consciousness and amnesia following a motor accident. This resolved within 11 days 
and was considered unrelated to study treatment.  
Safety in special populations 
A Phase III single centre study in prepubescent children with persistent asthma, aged 6 to 11 
years (study BFS-AS-305) was carried out to evaluate the systemic effects of BF Spiromax 
and Symbicort Turbohaler in this young age group (see details below). No safety studies have 
been presented in adolescents. 
Study BFS-AS-305: A double blind, double dummy, randomised, placebo- and 
active-controlled, three-way crossover study to evaluate the effect of 
Budesonide/Formoterol Spiromax 80/4.5µg Inhalation Powder and Symbicort 
Turbohaler 100/6µg on the short-term lower leg growth rate in prepubescent 
children with persistent asthma (n=77 randomised) 
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-week, crossover study to 
evaluate the short-term effect of the inhaled corticosteroid, budesonide on lower leg growth 
rate (LLGR) through knemometry and to evaluate the effects of budesonide on the 
hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis. BF Spiromax 80/4.5µg, Symbicort 
Turbohaler 100/6µg and placebo were administered in a dose of two inhalations twice daily.  
- Primary Objective: To demonstrate non inferiority of BF Spiromax 80/4.5µg relative to 
Symbicort Turbohaler 100/6µg on short-term growth rate of the right lower leg as measured 
by knemometry in prepubescent children with persistent asthma. 
- Secondary Objectives: Assess the safety and tolerability of BF Spiromax and Symbicort 
Turbohaler; assess 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion during treatment with BF Spiromax 
relative to Symbicort Turbohaler; assess short-term right LLGR and 24-hour urinary cortisol 
excretion with BF Spiromax relative to Symbicort Turbohaler. 
Criteria for evaluation: 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
• 
growth  rate  of  the  right  lower  leg  as  measured  by  knemometry  after  2  weeks  of 
study treatment.

Statistical methods: 
Sample Size: A sample size of 72 (12 per sequence group) evaluable subjects was required 
to  assure  a  power  of  90%  to  detect  a  difference  in  growth  rate  of  no  more  than  0.20 
mm/week, which was considered to be the non-inferiority margin for the difference between 
BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler,  with  a  within-subject  standard  deviation  of  0.275 
mm/week  and  a  one-sided  significance  level  of  2.5%.  This  assumed  that  the  true  mean 
difference between BF Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler in the short-term LLGR was 0.05 
mm/week.  Estimating  a  drop-out  rate  of  about  5-10%,  approximately  78  (13  per  sequence 
group)  prepubescent  children  with  persistent  asthma  were  to  be  enrolled  in  this  study.  Any 
subject who withdrew after randomisation was not replaced. 
Primary endpoint  – Systemic safety:  The  short-term  LLGR  as  measured  by  knemometry 
of  the  right  lower  leg  [mm/week]  was  compared  between  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort 
Turbohaler via a 97.5% one-sided confidence interval derived for treatment difference from a 
crossover ANOVA model allowing for fixed effects due to treatment, sequence and period and 
a  random  effect  of  subject  within  sequence.  A  non-inferiority  analysis  was  performed  to 
demonstrate  that  BF  Spiromax  is  not  inferior  to  Symbicort  Turbohaler  in  short-term  LLGR. 
Non-inferiority  was  demonstrated  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  97.5%  one-sided  confidence 
interval  for  the  treatment  difference  in  the  short-term  LLGR  (BF  Spiromax  minus  Symbicort 
Turbohaler) was greater than -0.20 mm/week. The PP population was the primary population 
for this analysis and the ITT population was the secondary population. 
Secondary  endpoint  –  Systemic  safety:  The  urinary  cortisol  (UC)  population  was  the 
primary  population  for  analyses  of  24-hour  urinary  cortisol  excretion  and  cortisol/creatinine 
ratio, the ITT Population was the secondary. However, the number of subjects who met the 
criteria  for  inclusion  in  the  UC  population  was  <25%  (n=19)  of  the  overall  population,  thus 
making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. As a result, a modified urine cortisol (MUC) 
population  was  defined  in  which  the  only  individual  values  excluded  were  those  associated 
with  an  inadequate  collection  (based  on  examination  of  both  the  urine  volume  and  urine 
creatinine  relative  to  published  normal  and  laboratory  standards)  or  for  which  there  was  an 
obvious  mismatch  between  the  urine  volume  and  urine  creatinine  (e.g.,  very  high  urine 
volume with very low urine creatinine). All decisions for inclusion in the MUC population were 
made while the data were still blinded and without knowledge of the urine cortisol excretion 
results.  
Other  endpoints  including  inspiratory  flow  rates,  morning  and  evening  PEF  and  the 
percentage of rescue-free days were summarised by treatment group. Changes from period-
specific baseline were also summarised by treatment group. Further details of the statistical 
models used in the analysis of these endpoints can be found in the main body of the clinical 
study report (CSR). 
All the other safety assessments were conducted using the Safety Population. 
Data were summarised by incidence, means, changes, and shifts depending on the measure. 
The  statistical  model  for  24-hour  urinary  cortisol  excretion  and  cortisol/creatinine  ratio  is 
detailed in the main body of the CSR.

A  urine  cortisol  population  was  defined  but  the  number  of  subjects  who  met  the  criteria  for 
inclusion  was  < 25%  (n=19)  of  the  overall  study  population  and  therefore  conclusions  from 
the  data  collected  were  difficult  to  draw.  Prior  to  unblinding  the  study  a  modified  urine

associated  with  an  inadequate  collection  or  for  which  there  was  an  obvious  mismatch 
between the urine volume and urine creatinine.  
There  appeared  to  be  no  real  differences  in  24-hour  urine  cortisol  excretion  between  BF

The overall effects of BF Spiromax 80/4.5µg and Symbicort Turbohaler 100/6µg were similar, 
the  ANCOVA  showed  no  significant  differences  between  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort 
Turbohaler for morning or evening PEF.  For the PP  population the overall least squares (LS) 
mean  treatment  difference  (BF  Spiromax  minus  Symbicort  Turbohaler)  was  2.8  L/min;  95% 
CI  (-3.1,  8.7);  p=0.3470  for  morning  PEF  and  0.4  L/min;  95%  CI  (-5.6,  6.5)  p=0.8915  for 
evening PEF. 
Following  both  BF  Spiromax  80/4.5µg  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  100/6µg,  statistically  and 
clinically  significant  increases  were  seen  in  both  morning  and  evening  PEF  compared  with 
placebo.  Both  treatments  resulted  in  improvements  relative  to  placebo  exceeding  15  L/min 
for  both  morning  and  evening  PEF.  It  can  be  noted  that15  L/min  is  a  commonly  used 
superiority margin in efficacy studies in asthma in children.  
The  overall  LS  mean  treatment  difference  for  BF  Spiromax  relative  to  placebo  was  18.8 
L/min; 95% CI (12.9, 24.6); p<0.0001 for morning PEF and 15.4 L/min; 95% CI (9.3, 21.5); 
p<0.0001 for evening PEF. 
The  overall  LS  mean  treatment  difference  for  Symbicort  Turbohalerrelative  to  placebo  was 
16.0 L/min; 95% CI (10.1, 21.8); p<0.0001 for morning PEF and 15.0 L/min; 95% CI: (8.9, 
21.1); p<0.0001 for evening PEF. 
Rescue-free Days 
There were no significant differences among any of the treatment groups for the percentage 
of  rescue-free  days;  baseline  values  ranged  from  72-88%  across  the  treatment  groups 
leaving minimal room for any improvement. 
Laboratory findings 
Regarding study BFS-AS-106, heart rate rose by a maximum of approximately 10 bpm (after 
the  third  dose)  in  the  lower  strength  for  both  products  and  systolic  blood  pressure  by 
approximately  3  mm  Hg.    For  the  high  strength  comparison  the  maximum  change  in  heart 
rate was 21.6 bpm for BF Spiromax at four hours and 14.0 for Symbicort at four hours. The 
maximum change from baseline in systolic blood pressure was 15.5 mm Hg for Spiromax and 
11.9  mm  Hg  for  Symbicort.  Additionally,  there  were  changes  in  serum  potassium  over  time 
for the low and high strength as well as changes in blood glucose. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No studies were performed on drug interactions with regard to safety. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Study BFS-AS-105, four subjects were withdrawn due to non-serious AEs: 
-  Subject  10003  was  withdrawn  on  Day  1  of  treatment  period  4  (Symbicort  Turbohaler 
400/12  mcg  +  charcoal)  due  to  an  episode  of  moderate  cataplexy  which  lasted  for 
approximately 5 hours. The event was not considered related to study medication. 
CHMP assessment report

 -  Subject  10053  was  withdrawn  on  Day  7  of  treatment  period  1  (Symbicort  Turbohaler 
400/12  mcg)  due  to  a  moderate  tooth  infection.  The  event  was  not  considered  related  to 
study medication. 
- Subject 10056 was withdrawn on Day 7 of treatment period 3 (BF Spiromax 320/9 mcg + 
charcoal)  due  to  a  moderate  tooth  infection.  The  event  was  not  considered  related  to  study 
medication. 
- Subject 10087 was withdrawn on Day 8 of treatment period 3 (BF Spiromax 320/9 mcg + 
charcoal)  due  to  moderate  gastroenteritis.  The  event  was  not  considered  related  to  study 
medication. 
In  Study  BFS-AS-107,  Subject  17047  withdrew  due  to  moderate  gingival  abscess  after 
receiving BF Spiromax 320/9 mcg in treatment period 3. This event was considered unrelated 
to treatment.  
In  Study  BFS-BE-109  Subject  2016  presented  during  the  end  of  study  visit,  with  a  positive 
pregnancy test result. The pregnancy was reported according to protocol requirements.  
In Study BFS-BE-110 Subject 1020 presented a mild cough during the wash-out period after 
period  2  (Symbicort  Turbohaler  200/6  mcg)  and  was  withdrawn  from  the  study.  This  AE 
resolved  spontaneously  without  any  corrective  treatment  and  was  considered  not  related  to 
study treatment. 
In  Study  BFS-BE-108  Subject  3040  withdrew  after  the  wash-out  period  after  period  2 
(Symbicort  Turbohaler  200/6  mcg)  due  to  mild  gastroenteritis.  This  AE  resolved 
spontaneously  without  any  corrective  treatment  and  was  considered  not  related  to  study 
treatment. 
Post-marketing experience 
This  new  fixed-dose  combination  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  is  not  marketed in 
any country worldwide. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  clinical  safety  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  has  been  investigated 
extensively, is well known and has been the subject of many publications.  
The  lack  of  the  submission  of  a  full  clinical  safety  programme  is  acceptable  in  this  type  of 
application  and 
is 
in 
line  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  orally 
inhaled  products 
(CHMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) since equivalence has been demonstrated for the high strength 
(320/9 µg per dose) and the middle strength (160/4.5 µg per dose). 
The  Applicant  has  assessed  and  presented  the  safety  data  generated  in  the  clinical 
pharmacology studies presented in support of these applications. No Phase III safety studies 
in adults, including long-term safety studies, have been included in the submitted dossier. 
The systemic safety of inhaled budesonide and inhaled formoterol fumarate on the short-term 
lower leg growth rate in prepubescent children with persistent asthma has been presented in 
study  BFS-AS-305  (children  aged  6  to  11  years)  and  in  study  BFS-AS-106  (healthy 
volunteers). Both of these studies were carried out with the original formulation of this fixed-
dose  combination,  a  formulation  which  will  not  progress  to  authorisation  or  the  market.  A 
new  formulation  was  subsequently  proposed  with  an  alternative  micronisation  process 
resulting in larger and more course particles, which is proposed as the final formulation for all

three strengths of this new fixed-dose combination. Section 9 of the CHMP Guideline on orally 
inhaled  products  (CHMP/EWP/4151/00  Rev.  1)  also  addresses  the  requirements  for 
authorisation  of  orally  inhaled  products  in  adolescents  aged  13  to  17  years.  In  the  light  of 
these  requirements,  the  systemic  safety  study  (study  BFS-AS-305)  in  children  with  asthma 
aged 6 to 11 years, has been included in these submissions not only to ensure that all clinical 
studies  carried  out  with  this  new  fixed-dose  combination  of  budesonide  and  formoterol 
fumarate are presented but also to bridge between adults and children, primarily in respect of 
efficacy,  in  order  that  adolescents  (aged  13  to  17  years)  can  be  included  in  the  indicated 
patients with asthma in whom this new FDC can be used. 
Considering  the  findings  in  Study  BFS-AS-305  described  above  and  the  use  of  the  low 
strength product micronised to the original specifications, this study was not accepted by the 
CHMP  as  a  ‘bridging  study’  for  authorisation  of  this  new  fixed-dose  combination  in 
adolescents. The study should have been designed to use the proposed final formulation for 
this  low  strength  product,  formulated  with  the  modified  micronisation  process  and 
appropriately  designed  and  powered  to  assess  therapeutic  equivalence  in  respect  of  both 
efficacy and safety. 
This  study  has  used  the  low  strength  product,  BF  spiromax  80/4.5µg,  micronised  to  the 
original specifications and a formulation not proposed for authorisation or the market. 
Although both the test and the reference products were shown to be superior to placebo, the 
primary  objective  of  the  study  was  the  assessment  of  the  systemic  effects  of  the  inhaled 
corticosteroid component of this fixed-dose combination in children less than 12 years of age. 
The study was not designed to show equivalent efficacy in terms of pulmonary function (the 
efficacy assessments were secondary objectives).  
In  respect  of  efficacy  the  study  did  have  assay  sensitivity.  However  the  study  should  have 
included  other  dose  regimens  in  further  treatment  arms  to  enable  differentiation  between 
doses  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  between  the  test  and  reference  products  and 
confirm  equivalence  of  the  test  and  the  reference  product  or  superiority  of  the  test  product 
over the reference product. 
Furthermore,  in  respect  of  the  primary  systemic  safety  endpoint  (growth  rate  of  the  right 
lower leg as measured by knemometry), there is some evidence to suggest that BF Spiromax 
suppresses lower leg growth rate by a greater amount than Symbicort Turbohaler, indicating 
a possible greater systemic effect. 
In the light of the findings in this study and the use of the low strength product micronised to 
the  original  specifications,  this  study  cannot  be  accepted  as  a  ‘bridging  study’  for 
authorisation  of  this  new  fixed-dose  combination  in  adolescents  (aged  13  to  18  years).  The 
study  should  have  used  the  proposed  final  formulation  for  this  low  strength  product, 
formulated with the modified micronisation process and appropriately designed and powered 
to assess therapeutic equivalence in respect of both efficacy and safety. 
The  CHMP  recommended  that  the  further  development  of  this  new  fixed-dose  combination 
product  in  adolescents  should  be  considered  particularly  in  the  light  of  this  combination 
containing an inhaled corticosteroid. 
In  conclusion,  adolescents  (and  children)  have  not  been  studied  appropriately  in  the 
development programme submitted with this application. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that  
this  product  should  not be  authorised  for  use in  adolescents  at  this  time  and that  the  lower 
limit of the age range for use of these fixed-dose combinations should be 18 years.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  clinical  safety  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  has  been  investigated 
extensively, is well known and has been the subject of many publications.  
The  presence  of  a  full  clinical  safety  programme  is  not  considered  necessary  in  this  type  of 
application  and 
is 
in 
line  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  orally 
inhaled  products 
(CHMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) since equivalence has been demonstrated for the high strength 
(320/9 µg per dose) and the middle strength (160/4.5 µg per dose). The high dose and the 
medium  dose  of  DuoResp  Spiromax  have  been  shown  to  be  equivalent  to  the  reference 
product. Hence their unfavourable effects are expected to be similar to the well-known safety 
profile of the reference product (Symbicort Turbohaler) when used in line with the approved 
indications and posology of the reference product. As the low-dose formulation has not been 
conclusively  shown  to  be  equivalent  to  the  reference  product,  there  is  uncertainty  about  its 
safety profile at the proposed dose and indications. 
The CHMP aslo concluded that Study BFS-AS-305 cannot be accepted as a ‘bridging study’ for 
authorisation  of  this  new  fixed-dose  combination  in  adolescents  and  recommended  that  the 
proposed  final  formulation  for  this  low  strength  product,  formulated  with  the  modified 
micronisation  process  and  appropriately  designed  and  powered  to  assess  therapeutic 
equivalence in respect of both efficacy and safety should be used by the applicant. 
This was agreed by the Applicant and the indication in adolescents was withdrawn.

Systemic effects may occur with any 
inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high 
doses prescribed for long periods. These 
effects are much less likely to occur with 
inhalation treatment than with oral 
corticosteroids. 
Possible systemic effects include Cushing's 
syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal 
suppression, growth retardation in 
children and adolescents, decrease in 
bone mineral density, cataract and 
glaucoma and more rarely, a range of 
psychological or behavioural effects

aggression (particularly in children)  (see 
section 4.8). 
It is recommended that the height of 
children receiving prolonged treatment 
with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly 
monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy 
should be re-evaluated with the aim of 
reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid 
to the lowest dose at which effective 
control of asthma is maintained, if 
possible. The benefits of the corticosteroid 
therapy and the possible risks of 
growth suppression must be carefully 
weighed. In addition consideration should 
be given to  referring the patient to a 
paediatric respiratory specialist. 
Limited data from long-term studies 
suggest that most children and 
adolescents treated with inhaled 
budesonide will ultimately achieve their 
adult target height. However, an initial 
small but transient reduction in growth 
(approximately 1 cm) has been observed. 
This generally occurs within the first year 
of treatment.  
Potential effects on bone density should 
be considered, particularly in patients on 
high doses for prolonged periods that 
have co-existing risk factors for 
osteoporosis. Long-term studies with 
inhaled budesonide in children at mean 
daily doses of 400 micrograms (metered 
dose) or in adults at daily doses of 800 
micrograms (metered dose) have not 
shown any significant effects on bone 
mineral density. No information regarding 
the effect of a budesonide/formorterol 
fumarate dihydrate fixed-dose 
combination  at higher doses is available 
If there is any reason to suppose that 
adrenal function is impaired from previous 
systemic steroid therapy, care should be 
taken when transferring patients to a

function for some considerable time. In 
such circumstances hypothalamic pituitary 
adrenocortical (HPA) axis function should 
be monitored regularly. 
Prolonged treatment with high doses of 
inhaled corticosteroids, particularly higher 
than recommended doses, may also result 
in clinically significant adrenal 
suppression. Therefore additional systemic 
corticosteroid cover should be considered 
during periods of stress such as severe 
infections or elective surgery. Rapid 
reduction in the dose of steroids can 
induce acute adrenal crisis. Symptoms 
and signs which might be seen in acute 
adrenal crisis may be somewhat vague 
but may include anorexia, abdominal pain, 
weight loss, tiredness, headache, nausea, 
vomiting, decreased level of 
consciousness, seizures, hypotension and 
hypoglycaemia. 
Treatment with supplementary systematic 
steroids or inhaled budesonide should not 
be stopped abruptly. 
During transfer from oral therapy toa  
budesonide/formoterol fumarate fixed 
dose combination therapy, a generally 
lower systemic steroid action will be 
experienced which may result in the 
appearance of allergic or arthritic 
symptoms such as rhinitis, eczema and 
muscle and joint pain. Specific treatment 
should be initiated for these conditions. A 
general insufficient glucocorticosteroid 
effect should be suspected if, in rare 
cases, symptoms such as tiredness, 
headache, nausea and vomiting should 
occur. In these cases a temporary 
increase in the dose of oral 
glucocorticosteroids is sometimes 
necessary. 
Section 4.8, undesirable effects, SmPC: 
Systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids 
may occur, particularly at high doses 
prescribed for long periods. These effects 
are much less likely to occur than with 
oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic 
effects include Cushing´s syndrome, 
Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, 
growth retardation in children and 
adolescents, decrease in bone mineral 
density, cataract and glaucoma. Increased 
susceptibility to infections and impairment 
of the ability to adapt to stress may also 
occur. Effects are probably dependent on 
dose, exposure time, concomitant and 
previous steroid exposure and individual 
sensitivity.

Caution should be observed when treating 
patients with prolongation of the QTc-
interval. Formoterol itself may induce 
prolongation of the QTc-interval. 
Potentially serious hypokalaemia may 
result from high doses of beta2-

treatment of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists 
with drugs which can induce hypokalaemia 
or potentiate a hypokalaemic effect, e.g. 
xanthine-derivatives, steroids and 
diuretics, may add to a possible 
hypokalaemic effect of the beta2-

recommended in unstable asthma with 
variable use of rescue bronchodilators, in 
acute severe asthma as the associated

Interaction with other medicinal products 
Concomitant treatment with itraconazole,

this is not possible the time interval 
between administrations of the interacting

Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg. 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, 
posaconazole, clarithromycin, 
telithromycin, nefazodone and HIV 
protease inhibitors) are likely to markedly 
increase plasma levels of budesonide and 
concomitant use should be avoided. If this 
is not possible the time interval between 
administration of the inhibitor and 
budesonide should be as long as possible 
(see section 4.4). In patients using potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitors, a fixed-dose 
combination of budesonide and formoterol 
fumarate dihydrate maintenance and 
reliever therapy is not recommended. 
The potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, 
200 mg once daily, increased plasma 
levels of concomitantly orally administered 
budesonide (single dose 3 mg) on average 
six-fold. When ketoconazole was 
administered 12 hours after budesonide 
the concentration was on average 
increased only three-fold showing that 
separation of the administration times can 
reduce the increase in plasma levels. 
Limited data about this interaction for 
high-dose inhaled budesonide indicates 
that marked increases in plasma levels

None  
breast feeding women 
For a fixed-dose combination of 
budesonide and formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate or the concomitant treatment 
with formoterol and budesonide, no 
clinical data on exposed pregnancies are 
available.  Data from an embryo-fetal 
development study in the rat, showed no 
evidence of any additional effect from the 
combination. 
There are no adequate data from use of 
formoterol in pregnant women.  In animal 
studies formoterol has caused adverse 
reactions in reproduction studies at very 
high systemic exposure levels (see section 
5.3). 
Data on approximately 2000 exposed 
pregnancies indicate no increased 
teratogenic risk associated with the use of 
inhaled budesonide.  In animal studies 
glucocorticosteroids have been shown to 
induce malformations (see section 5.3).  
This is not likely to be relevant for humans 
given recommended doses.

Systemic 
glucocorticosteroid 
effects 
Section 4.4, special warnings and precautions for 
use, SmPC: 
Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled 
corticosteroid, particularly at high doses 
prescribed for long periods. These effects are 
much less likely to occur with inhalation 
treatment than with oral corticosteroids. 
Possible systemic effects include Cushing's 
syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal 
suppression, growth retardation in children and 
adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, 
cataract and glaucoma and more rarely, a range 
of psychological or behavioural effects including 
psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, 
anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in 
children)  (see section 4.8). 
It is recommended that the height of children 
receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled 
corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth 
is slowed, therapy should be re-evaluated with 
the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled 
corticosteroid to the lowest dose at which 
effective control of asthma is maintained, if 
possible. The benefits of the corticosteroid 
therapy and the possible risks of 
growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In 
addition consideration should be given to  
referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory 
specialist.

Limited data from long-term studies suggest that 
most children and adolescents treated with 
inhaled budesonide will ultimately achieve their 
adult target height. However, an initial small but 
transient reduction in growth (approximately 1 
cm) has been observed. This generally occurs 
within the first year of treatment.  
Potential effects on bone density should be 
considered, particularly in patients on high doses 
for prolonged periods that have co-existing risk 
factors for osteoporosis. Long-term studies with 
inhaled budesonide in children at mean daily 
doses of 400 micrograms (metered dose) or in 
adults at daily doses of 800 micrograms (metered 
dose) have not shown any significant effects on 
bone mineral density. No information regarding 
the effect of a budesonide/formorterol fumarate 
dihydrate fixed-dose combination  at higher 
doses is available 
If there is any reason to suppose that adrenal 
function is impaired from previous systemic 
steroid therapy, care should be taken when 
transferring patients to a budesonide/formoterol 
fumarate fixed dose combination therapy. 
The benefits of inhaled budesonide therapy would 
normally minimise the need for oral steroids, but 
patients transferring from oral steroids may 
remain at risk of impaired adrenal reserve for a 
considerable time. Recovery may take a 
considerable amount of time after cessation of 
oral steroid therapy and hence oral steroid-
dependent patients transferred to inhaled 
budesonide may remain at risk from impaired 
adrenal function for some considerable time. In 
such circumstances hypothalamic pituitary 
adrenocortical (HPA) axis function should be 
monitored regularly. 
Prolonged treatment with high doses of inhaled 
corticosteroids, particularly higher than 
recommended doses, may also result in clinically 
significant adrenal suppression. Therefore 
additional systemic corticosteroid cover should be 
considered during periods of stress such as 
severe infections or elective surgery. Rapid 
reduction in the dose of steroids can induce acute 
adrenal crisis. Symptoms and signs which might 
be seen in acute adrenal crisis may be somewhat 
vague but may include anorexia, abdominal pain, 
weight loss, tiredness, headache, nausea, 
vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, 
seizures, hypotension and hypoglycaemia.

use, SmPC: 
A fixed-dose combination of budesonide and 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate should be 
administered with caution in patients with 
untreated hypokalaemia. 
Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from 
high doses of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists.  
Concomitant treatment of beta2-adrenoceptor 
agonists with medicinal products which can 
induce hypokalaemia or potentiate a 
hypokalaemic effect, e.g. xanthine-derivatives, 
steroids and diuretics, may add to a possible 
hypokalaemic effect of the beta2-adrenoceptor 
agonist. 
Particular caution is recommended in unstable 
asthma with variable use of rescue 
bronchodilators, in acute severe asthma as the 
associated risk may be augmented by hypoxia 
and in other conditions when the likelihood for 
hypokalaemia is increased.  It is recommended

Interaction with other medicinal products 
Concomitant treatment with itraconazole, 
ritonavir or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should 
be avoided (see section 4.5).  If this is not 
possible the time interval between 
administrations of the interacting medicinal 
products should be as long as possible.  In 
patients using potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, a 
budesonide/formoterol fumarate fixed dose 
combination is not recommended. 
Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg. ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, 
clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone and 
HIV protease inhibitors) are likely to markedly 
increase plasma levels of budesonide and 
concomitant use should be avoided. If this is not 
possible the time interval between administration 
of the inhibitor and budesonide should be as long 
as possible (see section 4.4). In patients using 
potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, a fixed-dose 
combination of budesonide and formoterol 
fumarate dihydrate maintenance and reliever 
therapy is not recommended. 
The potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, 200 
mg once daily, increased plasma levels of 
concomitantly orally administered budesonide 
(single dose 3 mg) on average six-fold. When 
ketoconazole was administered 12 hours after 
budesonide the concentration was on average 
increased only three-fold showing that separation 
of the administration times can reduce the 
increase in plasma levels. Limited data about this

interaction for high-dose inhaled budesonide 
indicates that marked increases in plasma levels 
(on average four fold) may occur if itraconazole, 
200 mg once daily, is administered concomitantly 
with inhaled budesonide (single dose of 1000 
micrograms). 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
β -adrenergic blockers can weaken or inhibit the 
effect of formoterol. A fixed-dose combination of 
budesonide and formoterol fumarate dehydrate 
should therefore not be given together with  β -
adrenergic blockers (including eye drops) unless 
there are compelling reasons. 
MISSING INFORMATION 
Use in pregnant or 
Pregnancy 
None  
breast feeding women 
For a fixed-dose combination of budesonide and 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate or the concomitant 
treatment with formoterol and budesonide, no 
clinical data on exposed pregnancies are 
available.  Data from an embryo-fetal 
development study in the rat, showed no 
evidence of any additional effect from the 
combination. 
There are no adequate data from use of 
formoterol in pregnant women.  In animal studies 
formoterol has caused adverse reactions in 
reproduction studies at very high systemic 
exposure levels (see section 5.3). 
Data on approximately 2000 exposed 
pregnancies indicate no increased teratogenic 
risk associated with the use of inhaled 
budesonide.  In animal studies 
glucocorticosteroids have been shown to induce 
malformations (see section 5.3).  This is not 
likely to be relevant for humans given 
recommended doses. 
Animal studies have also identified an 
involvement of excess prenatal glucocorticoids in 
increased risks for intrauterine growth 
retardation, adult cardiovascular disease and 
permanent changes in glucocorticoid receptor 
density, neurotransmitter turnover and behaviour 
at exposures below the teratogenic dose range.

During pregnancy, a fixed-dose combination of 
budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 
should only be used when the benefits outweigh 
the potential risks.  The lowest effective dose of 
budesonide needed to maintain adequate asthma 
control should be used. 
Breast-feeding 
Budesonide is excreted in breast milk.  However, 
at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling 
child are anticipated.  It is not known whether 
formoterol passes into human breast milk.  In 
rats, small amounts of formoterol have been 
detected in maternal milk.  Administration of a 
fixed-dose combination of budesonide and 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate to women who are 
breast-feeding should only be considered if the 
expected benefit to the mother is greater than 
any possible risk to the child.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Clinical studies in adults have shown that the addition of formoterol to budesonide improved 
asthma  symptoms  and  lung  function,  and  reduced  exacerbations.  Budesonide/formoterol 
provided  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  reductions  in  severe  exacerbations 
as  well  as  rapid  and  effective  relief  of  bronchoconstriction  similar  to  salbutamol  and 
formoterol.  
The  two  pivotal  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  the  high  strength  (320/9  µg  per  dose)  and  the 
middle strength (160/4.5 µg per dose) demonstrated equivalence between BF Spiromax and

EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 113/117 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Symbicort  Turbohaler  for  all  comparisons  both  with  and  without  a  charcoal  blockade.  This 
fixed-dose  combination  product  is  expected  to  have  the  same  benefits  as  the  reference 
product  (Symbicort  Turbohaler)  in  improving  lung  function  and  relieving  symptoms  in 
patients with asthma and COPD when used in line with the approved indications and posology 
of the reference product. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  pharmacokinetic  equivalence  of  the  high-dose  and  the  medium-dose  has  been 
conclusively shown. However the pharmacokinetic equivalence of the low dose remains to be 
conclusively  demonstrated  given  the  lack  of  a  pharmacokinetic  study  or  any  other  clinical 
study  to  conclusively  demonstrate  the  equivalence  of  the  low  strength  (80/4.5)  of  DuoResp 
Spiromax  with  the  low  strength  of  the  reference  product.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  withdrew 
the low dose DuoResp Spiromax.  
There  is  no  conclusive  data  on  the  equivalence  of  DuoResp  Spiromax  with  the  reference 
product  in  children  and  adolescents  and  therefore  there  is  a  lack  of  demonstration  of  a 
positive  benefit/risk  balance  in  this  population.  Therefore,  the  applicant  agreed  to  limit  the 
use of DuoResp Spiromax to adults aged 18 and older. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The high dose and the medium dose of DuoResp Spiromax have been shown to be equivalent 
to the reference product. Hence their unfavourable  effects are expected to be similar to the 
well-known safety profile of the reference product (Symbicort Turbohaler) when used in line 
with the approved indications and posology of the reference product. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As  the  low-dose  formulation  has  not  been  conclusively  shown  to  be  equivalent  to  the 
reference  product,  there  is  uncertainty  about  its  safety  profile  at  the  proposed  dose  and 
indications.  Since  it  cannot  be  accepted that  this  will  be  similar to the  reference  at  present, 
the Applicant decided to withdraw the low strength of DuoResp Spiromax Due to the lack of 
adequate  and  conclusive  evidence  of  the  equivalence  of  DuoResp  Spiromax  in  adolescents 
and  children,  there  is  uncertainty  about  the  safety  profile  in  this  population.  At  present,  it 
cannot  be  accepted  that  the  profile  of  DuoResp  Spiromax  will  be  similar  to  that  of  the 
reference  product  in  this  population  and  hence  the  above-mentioned  withdrawal  of  the  low 
dose product. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Conclusive  demonstration  of  equivalence  of  DuoResp  Spiromax  with  the  reference  product 
has  not  been  done  for  the  low-dose  strength  and  hence  this  introduces  a  large  risk  of 
undetermined  efficacy/safety  for  this  strength.  Moreover  the  downward  titration  of  dose  in 
patients where required cannot be done with confidence. 
Furthermore, due to the lack of adequate and conclusive data in adolescents and children, it 
cannot be concluded with confidence that the efficacy/safety profile of DuoResp Spiromax will 
be  the  same  as  the  reference  product.  Therefore  the  use  of  DuoResp  Spiromax  in  children 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175692/2014 
Page 114/117 
 
  
  
and adolescents cannot be allowed at present. A restriction in indication only in adults brings 
with it the practical risk of “off-label” use in children, which is a safety concern.  
Benefit-risk balance 
DuoResp  Spiromax  will  be  an  alternative  to  high  dose  and  medium  dose  Symbicort 
Turbohaler  available  for  doctors  and  patients.  However  the  low  dose  alternate  cannot  be 
allowed  due  to  lack  of  conclusive  evidence  of  equivalence.  This  brings  in  the  risk  of  lack  of 
alternative for down-ward titration of dose when required. The lack of conclusive evidence of 
equivalence  in  adolescents  and  children  precludes  the  use  of  DuoResp  Spiromax  in  this 
population. The risk of “off-label” use in this population has been addressed by the inclusion 
of  the  statements  in  sections  4.1  and  4.2  of  the  SmPC  regarding  the  use  of  the  product  by 
adults 18 years old and older only.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  high  dose  and  medium  dose of  DuoResp  Spiromax have  been  conclusively  shown  to  be 
equivalent  in  adults  to  the  reference  Symbicort.  The  low-dose  DuoResp  Spiromax  has  not 
been conclusively shown to be equivalent and hence cannot be authorised at present. 
The  benefit  of  development  of  an  alternative  to  the  reference  product  which  increases 
treatment  options  for  patients  and  doctors  is  outweighed  by  the  potential  risks  due  to  the 
unknowns described above. The CHMP acknowledges that there is a lack of significant safety 
concerns. However the principles of authorising generics/hybrids rest on the pivotal point of 
demonstrating  equivalence.  When  this  is  not  adequately  demonstrated,  as  is  the  case  here 
for the low dose, the posology, safety and efficacy data of the reference cannot be considered 
to be reflective of the performance of the generic/hybrid product.  
Regarding  the  high  strength  (320/9  µg  per  dose)  and  the  middle  strength  (160/4.5  µg  per 
dose),  equivalence  between  BF  Spiromax  and  Symbicort  Turbohaler  has  been demonstrated 
and therefore the benefit/risk balance for these strengths is considered positive. 
The doses and dose regimens stated for this orally inhaled fixed-dose combination product for 
use  in  adults  are  acceptable.  However,  neither  adolescents  nor  children  have  not  been 
studied  appropriately  in  the  development  programme  submitted  with  this  application. 
Therefore,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  DuoResp  Spiromax  should  not  be  authorised  for  use  in 
adolescents  and  children  at  this  time  and  that  the  lower  limit  of  the  age  range  for  use  of 
these fixed-dose combinations should be 18 years. 
The proposal not to seek an indication in children is in line with the current data. The risk of 
“off-label”  use  in  this  population  has  been  addressed  by  the  inclusion  of  the  statements  in 
sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SmPC regarding the use of the product by adults 18 years old and 
older. 
The CHMP recommends that further development of this new fixed-dose combination product 
in children and adolescents should be considered particularly in the light of this combination 
containing  an  inhaled  corticosteroid.  In  addition,  the  CHMP  recommends  that  demonstration 
of  therapeutic  equivalence  in  respect  of  both  efficacy  and  safety  and  an  appropriate 
benefit/risk  balance  in  this  age  group  should  be  demonstrated  should  the  Applicant  seek 
approval of the lower strength fixed-dose combination in the future.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  DuoResp  Spiromax  in  the  regular  treatment  of 
asthma, where use of a combination (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 adrenoceptor 
agonist) is appropriate (in patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 
“as needed” inhaled short-acting β2 adrenoceptor agonists, or in patients already adequately 
controlled  on  both inhaled  corticosteroids  and long-acting  β2  adrenoceptor  agonists),  and  in 
the  symptomatic  treatment  of  patients  with  severe  COPD  (FEV1  <  50%  predicted  normal) 
and  a  history  of  repeated  exacerbations,  who  have  significant  symptoms  despite  regular 
therapy  with  long-acting  bronchodilators,  is  favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the 
granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

EMA/492446/2023 Rev.21 
Shortage of Ozempic (semaglutide) 
Solution for injection 1 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.25 mg prefilled pen2 
Indication 
Ozempic is a diabetes medicine used with diet and exercise to treat adults whose 
type 2 diabetes is not satisfactorily controlled.  
Ozempic can be used on its own in patients who cannot take metformin (another 
diabetes medicine). It can also be used as an ‘add-on’ to other diabetes 
medicines. 
The active substance in Ozempic, semaglutide, is a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-
1 RA). 
Reason for 
shortage  
Increased demand for Ozempic coupled with capacity constraints at some of the 
manufacturing sites have led to shortages. 
Although the company is taking mitigating measures, the shortage is expected to 
worsen in December 2023 and continue throughout 2024. It is uncertain when 
supplies will be sufficient to fully meet current demand.  
The supply shortage is not related to a quality defect of the product or a safety 
issue.

Monitoring of

For accurate information about the status of a medicine shortage in a particular 
Member State, consult the national shortage register or national competent 
authority. 
EMA’s SPOC working party3 is closely monitoring the supply situation and 
engaging with the marketing authorisation holder and other stakeholders to 
identify measures to mitigate the impact of the supply shortage.  
Summaries of the SPOC working party meetings can be found on EMA’s website.

• 
Increased demand for Ozempic coupled with capacity constraints at some of 
the manufacturing sites have led to shortages which are expected to worsen 
in December 2023 and continue throughout 2024. 
The company has limited the supply of the 0.25 mg starting dose for 
Ozempic. This will limit the number of new patients starting treatment and 
ensure that maintenance doses can be used for existing patients. 
If Ozempic is not available, patients currently using Ozempic may need to be 
safely switched to another injectable GLP-1 RA, or another suitable 
alternative based on your clinical judgement. 
•  A delay in switching may result in patients missing the required doses, which 
could have clinical consequences such as hyperglycaemia. 
•  Use outside its authorised use, such as for weight management, is 
considered off-label and affects the availability of the medicine to treat 
patients with type 2 diabetes. 
•  An updated direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC) has been 
sent to relevant healthcare professionals and is also available on the EMA 
website. 
•  Additional advice may be available from your country’s national shortage 
register or national competent authority.

If you are already being treated with Ozempic and the medicine is not 
available, you may need to switch to another treatment. You should make an 
appointment with your healthcare professional to discuss the need to switch.  
•  A delay in switching may cause you to miss doses, which could lead to high 
blood sugar levels.

considered off-label and affects the availability of the medicine to treat 
patients with type 2 diabetes.  
If you have any questions, speak to your doctor or pharmacist.

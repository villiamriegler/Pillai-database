Special populations 
Adults over 55 years old 
No studies have been performed in MS patients over 55 years old. Based on the limited data available, 
no dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients over 55 years old (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Patients with renal impairment are not expected to require dose modification (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with hepatic impairment are not expected to require dose modification (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Kesimpta in children aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been established. No 
data are available. 
Method of administration 
This medicinal product is intended for patient self-administration by subcutaneous injection. 
The usual sites for subcutaneous injections are the abdomen, the thigh and the upper outer arm. 
The first injection should be performed under the guidance of a healthcare professional (see 
section 4.4). 
Comprehensive instructions for administration are provided in the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients in a severely immunocompromised state (see section 4.4). 
Severe active infection until resolution (see section 4.4). 
Known active malignancy. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Injection-related reactions 
Patients should be informed that systemic injection-related reactions (SIRRs) could occur, generally 
within 24 hours and predominantly following the first injection (see section 4.8). Symptoms most 
frequently observed in RMS clinical studies include fever, headache, myalgia, chills and fatigue and 
were predominantly (99.8%) mild to moderate in severity. There were no life-threatening SIRRs 
reported in RMS clinical studies (see section 4.8). 
Additional SIRRs reported in the post-marketing setting include rash, urticaria, dyspnoea and 
angioedema (e.g. tongue, pharyngeal or laryngeal swelling), and rare cases which were reported as 
anaphylaxis. While there were some cases which were serious and resulted in discontinuation of 
ofatumumab treatment, there were also serious cases where patients were able to continue 
ofatumumab treatment without further incidents. 
Some SIRR symptoms may be clinically indistinguishable from Type 1 acute hypersensitivity 
reactions (IgE-mediated). A hypersensitivity reaction may present during any injection, although 
typically would not present with the first injection. For subsequent injections, more severe symptoms 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than previously experienced, or new severe symptoms, should prompt consideration of a potential 
hypersensitivity reaction. Patients with known IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to ofatumumab must 
not be treated with ofatumumab (see section 4.3). 
Only limited benefit of premedication with steroids was seen in RMS clinical studies. Injection-related 
reactions can be managed with symptomatic treatment, should they occur. Therefore, use of 
premedication is not required. 
Injection site reaction (local) symptoms observed in clinical studies included erythema, swelling, 
itching and pain (see section 4.8). 
The first injection should be performed under the guidance of an appropriately trained healthcare 
professional (see section 4.2). 
Infections 
It is recommended to evaluate the patient’s immune status prior to initiating therapy. 
Based on its mode of action and available clinical experience, ofatumumab has the potential for an 
increased risk of infections (see section 4.8). 
Administration should be delayed in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. 
Ofatumumab must not be given to patients in a severely immunocompromised state (e.g. significant 
neutropenia or lymphopenia). 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
Since John Cunningham (JC) virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML) has been observed in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies, other MS therapies, and 
ofatumumab at substantially higher doses in oncology indications, physicians should be vigilant for 
medical history of PML and for any clinical symptoms or MRI findings that may be suggestive of 
PML. If PML is suspected, treatment with ofatumumab should be suspended until PML has been 
excluded. 
Hepatitis B virus reactivation 
Hepatitis B reactivation has occurred in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies, which in some 
cases resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death. 
Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not be treated with ofatumumab. HBV screening should 
be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment. As a minimum, screening should include 
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) testing. These can be 
complemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with positive hepatitis 
B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) should consult a liver disease expert before the start of 
treatment and should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis 
B reactivation. 
Treatment of severely immunocompromised patients 
Patients in a severely immunocompromised state must not be treated until the condition resolves (see 
section 4.3). 
It is not recommended to use other immunosuppressants concomitantly with ofatumumab except 
corticosteroids for symptomatic treatment of relapses.

Vaccinations 
All immunisations should be administered according to immunisation guidelines at least 4 weeks prior 
to initiation of ofatumumab for live or live-attenuated vaccines and, whenever possible, at least 
2 weeks prior to initiation of ofatumumab for inactivated vaccines. 
Ofatumumab may interfere with the effectiveness of inactivated vaccines. 
The safety of immunisation with live or live-attenuated vaccines following ofatumumab therapy has 
not been studied. Vaccination with live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during 
treatment and after discontinuation until B-cell repletion (see section 4.5). The median time to B-cell 
recovery to the lower limit of normal (LLN, defined as 40 cells/µl) or baseline value is 24.6 weeks 
post treatment discontinuation based on data from phase III studies (see section 5.1). 
Vaccination of infants born to mothers treated with ofatumumab during pregnancy 
In infants of mothers treated with ofatumumab during pregnancy live or live-attenuated vaccines 
should not be administered before the recovery of B-cell counts has been confirmed. Depletion of B 
cells in these infants may increase the risks from live or live-attenuated vaccines. 
Inactivated vaccines may be administered as indicated prior to recovery from B-cell depletion, 
however assessment of vaccine immune responses, including consultation with a qualified specialist, 
should be considered to determine whether a protective immune response was mounted (see 
section 4.6). 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed, as no interactions are expected via cytochrome P450 
enzymes, other metabolising enzymes or transporters. 
Vaccinations 
The safety of and the ability to generate a primary or anamnestic (recall) response to immunisation 
with live, live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines during ofatumumab treatment has not been 
investigated. The response to vaccination could be impaired when B cells are depleted. It is 
recommended that patients complete immunisations prior to the start of ofatumumab therapy (see 
section 4.4). 
Other immunosuppressive or immune-modulating therapies 
The risk of additive immune system effects should be considered when co-administering 
immunosuppressive therapies with ofatumumab. 
When initiating ofatumumab after other immunosuppressive therapies with prolonged immune effects 
or initiating other immunosuppressive therapies with prolonged immune effects after ofatumumab, the 
duration and mode of action of these medicinal products should be taken into account because of 
potential additive immunosuppressive effects (see section 5.1).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception (methods that result in less than 
1% pregnancy rates) while receiving Kesimpta and for 6 months after the last administration of 
Kesimpta. 
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of ofatumumab in pregnant women. Ofatumumab may 
cross the placenta and cause foetal B-cell depletion based on findings from animal studies (see 
section 5.3). No teratogenicity was observed after intravenous administration of ofatumumab to 
pregnant monkeys during organogenesis. 
Transient peripheral B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in infants born to 
mothers exposed to other anti-CD20 antibodies during pregnancy. The potential duration of B-cell 
depletion in infants exposed to ofatumumab in utero, and the impact of B-cell depletion on the safety 
and effectiveness of vaccines, are unknown (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Treatment with ofatumumab should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the 
mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. 
To help determine the effects of ofatumumab in pregnant women, healthcare professionals are 
encouraged to report all pregnancy cases and complications that happen during treatment or within 
6 months after the last dose of ofatumumab to the local representative of the marketing authorisation 
holder, in order to allow monitoring of these patients through the PRegnancy outcomes Intensive 
Monitoring programme (PRIM). In addition, all adverse pregnancy events should be reported via the 
national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
Lactation 
The use of ofatumumab in women during lactation has not been studied. It is unknown whether 
ofatumumab is excreted in human milk. In humans, excretion of IgG antibodies in milk occurs during 
the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon afterwards. 
Consequently, a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded during this short period. Afterwards, 
ofatumumab could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed. However, if the patient was 
treated with ofatumumab up to the last few months of pregnancy, breast-feeding can be started 
immediately after birth. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of ofatumumab on human fertility. 
Non-clinical data did not indicate potential hazards for humans based on male and female fertility 
parameters assessed in monkeys. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Kesimpta has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most important and frequently reported adverse reactions are upper respiratory tract infections 
(39.4%), systemic injection-related reactions (20.6%), injection-site reactions (10.9%) and urinary

tract infections (11.9%) (see section 4.4 and below subsection “Description of selected adverse 
reactions” for further details). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions that have been reported in association with the use of ofatumumab in pivotal RMS 
clinical studies and from post-marketing experience are listed by MedDRA system organ class in 
Table 1. Within each system organ class, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most 
frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is 
based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon 
(≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000) and not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
In the RMS phase III clinical studies, the overall rate of infections and serious infections in patients 
treated with ofatumumab was similar to patients who were treated with teriflunomide (51.6% vs 
52.7%, and 2.5% vs 1.8%, respectively). Two patients (0.2%) discontinued and 11 patients (1.2%) 
temporarily interrupted study treatment due to a serious infection. 
Upper respiratory tract infections 
In these studies, 39.4% of ofatumumab-treated patients experienced upper respiratory tract infections 
compared to 37.8% of teriflunomide-treated patients. The infections were predominantly mild to 
moderate and mostly consisted of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and influenza. 
Injection-related reactions 
In the RMS phase III clinical studies, injection-related reactions (systemic) were reported in 20.6% of 
patients treated with ofatumumab. 
The incidence of injection-related reactions was highest with the first injection (14.4%), decreasing 
significantly with subsequent injections (4.4% with second, <3% from third injection). Injection-
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
related reactions were mostly (99.8%) mild to moderate in severity. Two (0.2%) ofatumumab-treated 
MS patients reported serious injection-related reactions but not life-threatening. The most frequently 
reported symptoms (≥2%) included fever, headache, myalgia, chills and fatigue. 
Injection-site reactions 
In the RMS phase III clinical studies, injection-site reactions (local) were reported in 10.9% of patients 
treated with ofatumumab. 
Local reactions at the administration site were very common. Injection-site reactions were all mild to 
moderate in severity and non-serious in nature. The most frequently reported symptoms (≥2%) 
included erythema, pain, itching and swelling. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Immunoglobulins 
During the course of the RMS phase III clinical studies, decrease in mean value of immunoglobulin M 
(IgM) (30.9% decrease after 48 weeks and 38.8% decrease after 96 weeks) was observed and no 
association with risk of infections, including serious infections, was shown. 
In 14.3% of patients, treatment with ofatumumab resulted in a decrease in IgM that reached a value 
below 0.34 g/l. 
Ofatumumab was associated with a transient decrease of 4.3% in mean immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
levels after 48 weeks of treatment but an increase of 2.2% after 96 weeks. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 700 mg have been administered in clinical studies with MS patients without dose-limiting 
toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or 
symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted as necessary. 
Ofatumumab has been previously used in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) indications, at doses 
up to 2 000 mg administered intravenously via infusion. Ofatumumab administered via subcutaneous 
injection has not been assessed and is not approved for these indications, and must not be used for the 
treatment of oncology indications.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AG12 
Mechanism of action 
Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody with a 
theoretical average molecular weight of 145kDa. The CD20 molecule is a transmembrane 
phosphoprotein expressed on B lymphocytes from the pre-B to mature B lymphocyte stage. The CD20 
molecule is also expressed on a small fraction of activated T cells. A subcutaneous route of 
administration of ofatumumab and subsequent release/absorption from the tissue allows a gradual 
interaction with B cells. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The binding of ofatumumab to CD20 induces lysis of CD20+ B cells primarily through complement-
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and, to a lesser extent, through antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC). Ofatumumab has also been shown to induce cell lysis in both high and low 
CD20 expressing cells. CD20-expressing T cells are also depleted by ofatumumab. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
B-cell depletion 
In the RMS clinical studies using ofatumumab 20 mg every 4 weeks, after an initial dose regimen of 
20 mg on days 1, 7, and 14, administration resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction of B cells to 
below LLN (defined as 40 cells/µl) as early as two weeks after treatment initiation. Before initiation of 
the maintenance phase starting at week 4, total B-cell levels of <10 cells/µl were reached in 94% of 
patients, increasing to 98% of patients at week 12, and were sustained for as long as 120 weeks (i.e. 
while on study treatment). 
B-cell repletion 
Data from RMS phase III clinical studies indicate a median time to B-cell recovery to LLN or baseline 
value of 24.6 weeks post treatment discontinuation. PK-B cell modelling and simulation for B-cell 
repletion corroborate this data, predicting median time to B-cell recovery to LLN of 23 weeks post 
treatment discontinuation. 
Immunogenicity 
In RMS phase III studies, the overall incidence of treatment-induced anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) was 
0.2% (2 of 914) in ofatumumab-treated patients and no patients with treatment enhancing or 
neutralising ADA were identified. The impact of positive ADA titers on PK, safety profile or B-cell 
kinetics cannot be assessed given the low incidence of ADA associated with ofatumumab. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of ofatumumab were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, active-
controlled phase III pivotal studies of identical design (Study 1 [ASCLEPIOS I] and Study 2 
[ASCLEPIOS II]) in patients with relapsing forms of MS (RMS) aged 18 to 55 years, a disability 
status at screening with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 0 to 5.5, and who had 
experienced at least one documented relapse during the previous year or two relapses during the 
previous two years or positive gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing MRI scan during the previous year. Both 
newly diagnosed patients and patients switching from their current treatment were enrolled. 
In the two studies, 927 and 955 patients with RMS, respectively, were randomised 1:1 to receive either 
ofatumumab 20 mg subcutaneous injections every 4 weeks starting at week 4 after an initial dosing 
regimen of three weekly 20 mg doses in the first 14 days (on days 1, 7 and 14) or teriflunomide 14 mg 
capsules orally once daily. Patients also received matching placebo corresponding to the other 
treatment arm to ensure blinding (double-dummy design). 
The treatment duration for individual patients was variable based on when the end of study criteria 
were met. Across both studies, the median treatment duration was 85 weeks, 33.0% of patients in the 
ofatumumab group vs 23.2% of patients in the teriflunomide group were treated more than 96 weeks. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were well-balanced across treatment arms and both studies 
(see Table 2). Mean age was 38 years, mean disease duration was 8.2 years since onset of first 
symptom, and mean EDSS score was 2.9; 40% of patients had not been previously treated with a 
disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and 40% had gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing T1 lesions on their 
baseline MRI scan. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of both studies was the annualised rate of confirmed relapses (ARR) 
based on EDSS. Key secondary efficacy endpoints included the time to disability worsening on EDSS 
(confirmed at 3 months and 6 months), defined as an increase in EDSS of ≥1.5, ≥1, or ≥0.5 in patients 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with a baseline EDSS of 0, 1 to 5, or ≥5.5, respectively. Further key secondary endpoints included the 
number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per MRI scan and the annualised rate of new or enlarging T2 
lesions. Disability-related key secondary endpoints were evaluated in a meta-analysis of combined 
data from ASCLEPIOS Study 1 and Study 2, as defined in the study protocols.

The efficacy results for both studies are summarised in Table 3 and Figure 1. 
In both phase III studies, ofatumumab compared to teriflunomide demonstrated a significant reduction 
in the annualised relapse rate of 50.5% and 58.4%, respectively. 
The pre-specified meta-analysis of combined data showed that ofatumumab compared to 
teriflunomide significantly reduced the risk of 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) by 
34.3% and the risk of 6-month CDP by 32.4% (see Figure 1). 
Ofatumumab compared to teriflunomide significantly reduced the number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions 
by 95.9% and the rate of new or enlarging T2 lesions by 83.5% (values represent mean reductions for 
the combined studies). 
A similar effect of ofatumumab on the key efficacy results compared to teriflunomide was observed 
across the two phase III studies in exploratory subgroups defined by sex, age, body weight, prior non-
steroid MS therapy, and baseline disability and disease activity.

1 The numbers shown on the curves represent Kaplan-Meier estimates of the risk of the event at 24 months (marked by the vertical dashed 
line). 
In the phase III studies, the proportion of patients with adverse events (AEs) (83.6% vs 84.2%) and the 
AEs leading to discontinuation (5.7% vs 5.2%) were similar in the ofatumumab and teriflunomide 
groups. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Kesimpta in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After subcutaneous administration, ofatumumab has a prolonged release/absorption profile (Tmax of 
4.3 days) and is predominantly absorbed via the lymphatic system. 
A monthly subcutaneous dose of 20 mg leads to a mean AUCtau of 483 µg*h/ml and a mean Cmax of 
1.43 µg/ml at steady state. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution at steady state was estimated to be 5.42 litres following repeated 
subcutaneous administration of ofatumumab at a dose of 20 mg. 
Biotransformation 
Ofatumumab is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides 
and amino acids by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Ofatumumab is eliminated in two ways: a target-mediated route that is related to binding to B cells 
and a target-independent route mediated by non-specific endocytosis followed by intracellular 
catabolism, as with other IgG molecules. B cells present at baseline result in a greater component of 
target-mediated clearance of ofatumumab at the start of therapy. Ofatumumab dosing leads to potent 
depletion of B cells resulting in reduced overall clearance. 
The half-life at steady state was estimated to be approximately 16 days following repeated 
subcutaneous administration of ofatumumab at a dose of 20 mg. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Ofatumumab had non-linear pharmacokinetics related to its decreasing clearance over time. 
Special populations 
Adults over 55 years old 
There are no dedicated pharmacokinetic studies of ofatumumab in patients over 55 years old due to 
limited clinical experience (see section 4.2). 
Paediatric population 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of ofatumumab in paediatric 
patients below the age of 18 years. 
Gender 
Gender had a modest (12%) effect on ofatumumab central volume of distribution in a cross-study 
population analysis, with higher Cmax and AUC values observed in female patients (48% of the 
patients in this analysis were male and 52% were female); these effects are not considered clinically 
relevant, and no dose adjustment is recommended. 
Body weight 
Based on the results of a cross-study population analysis, body weight was identified as a covariate of 
exposure (Cmax and AUC) to ofatumumab in RMS subjects. However, body weight did not affect 
safety and efficacy measures evaluated in the clinical studies; therefore, dose adjustment is not 
required. 
Renal impairment 
No specific studies of ofatumumab in patients with renal impairment have been performed. 
Patients with mild renal impairment were included in clinical studies. There is no experience in 
patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. However, as ofatumumab is not excreted via 
urine, it is not expected that patients with renal impairment require dose modification. 
Hepatic impairment 
No studies of ofatumumab in patients with hepatic impairment have been performed. 
Since hepatic metabolism of monoclonal antibodies such as ofatumumab is negligible, hepatic 
impairment is not expected to impact its pharmacokinetics. Therefore, it is not expected that patients 
with hepatic impairment require dose modification. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated 
dose toxicity including safety pharmacology endpoints. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neither carcinogenicity nor mutagenicity studies have been conducted with ofatumumab. As an 
antibody, ofatumumab is not expected to interact directly with DNA. 
The embryo-foetal development (EFD) and the enhanced pre/post-natal development (ePPND) studies 
in monkeys showed that exposure to ofatumumab given intravenously during gestation caused no 
maternal toxicity, no teratogenicity, and no adverse effects on embryo-foetal and pre/post-natal 
development. 
In these studies, ofatumumab was detected in the blood of the foetuses and infants, confirming 
placental transfer and foetal exposure to ofatumumab persisting post-natally (long half-life of the 
monoclonal antibody). Exposure to ofatumumab during gestation led to the expected depletion of 
CD20+ B cells in maternal animals and their foetuses and infants, along with a reduced spleen weight 
(without histological correlate) in foetuses and a reduced humoral immune response to keyhole limpet 
haemocyanin (KLH) in infants at high doses. All these changes were reversible during the 6-month 
post-natal period. In infants, early post-natal mortality was observed at a dose 160 times higher than 
the therapeutic dose (on AUC basis) and was likely due to potential infections secondary to 
immunomodulation. The NOAEL related to the pharmacological activity of ofatumumab in infants of 
the ePPND study leads to an AUC-based safety margin of at least 22-fold when maternal exposure at 
the NOAEL is compared with human exposure at the therapeutic dose of 20 mg monthly. 
In a dedicated monkey fertility study, male and female fertility endpoints were unaffected.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Kesimpta is and what it is used for 
What Kesimpta is 
Kesimpta contains the active substance ofatumumab. Ofatumumab belongs to a group of medicines 
called monoclonal antibodies. 
What Kesimpta is used for 
Kesimpta is used to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). 
How Kesimpta works 
Kesimpta works by attaching to a target called CD20 on the surface of B cells. B cells are a type of 
white blood cell which are part of the immune system (the body’s defences). In multiple sclerosis, the 
immune system attacks the protective layer around nerve cells. B cells are involved in this process. 
Kesimpta targets and removes the B cells and thereby reduces the chance of a relapse, relieves 
symptoms and slows down the progression of the disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Kesimpta 
Do not use Kesimpta 
- 
if you are allergic to ofatumumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have been told that you have severe problems with your immune system. 
if you are suffering from a severe infection. 
if you have cancer.

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Kesimpta 
- 
Kesimpta may cause the hepatitis B virus to become active again. Your doctor will perform a 
blood test to check if you are at risk of hepatitis B infection. If this shows that you have had 
hepatitis B or are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus, your doctor will ask you to see a specialist. 
Before you start treatment with Kesimpta, your doctor may check your immune system. 
If you have an infection, your doctor may decide that you cannot be given Kesimpta or may 
delay your treatment with Kesimpta until the infection is resolved. 
Your doctor will check if you need any vaccinations before you start your treatment with 
Kesimpta. If you need a type of vaccine called a live or live-attenuated vaccine, it should be 
given at least 4 weeks before you start Kesimpta treatment. Other types of vaccines should be 
given at least 2 weeks before you start Kesimpta treatment. 
While using Kesimpta 
Tell your doctor: 
- 
if you have a general injection-related reaction or a local injection-site reaction. These are the 
most common side effects of Kesimpta treatment and are described in section 4. They usually 
occur in the 24 hours after Kesimpta is injected, in particular after the first injection. The first 
injection should take place under the guidance of a healthcare professional. 
if you have an infection. You may get infections more easily or an infection you already have 
may get worse. This is because the immune cells that Kesimpta targets also help to fight 
infection. Infections could be serious and sometimes even life-threatening. 
if you plan to have any vaccinations. Your doctor will tell you whether the vaccination you need 
is a live vaccine, a live-attenuated vaccine, or another type of vaccine. You should not be given 
live or live-attenuated vaccines during treatment with Kesimpta as this may result in infection. 
Other types of vaccines may work less well if they are given during treatment with Kesimpta. 
Tell your doctor straight away if you get any of the following during your treatment with Kesimpta, 
because they could be signs of a serious condition: 
- 
if you have rash, hives, trouble breathing, swelling of the face, eyelids, lips, mouth, tongue or 
throat, chest tightness, or feel faint. These could be signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction. 
if you think your multiple sclerosis is getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if you 
notice any new or unusual symptoms. These effects may indicate a rare brain disorder called 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is caused by a virus infection. 
- 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years of age because Kesimpta has not 
yet been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Kesimpta 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist: 
- 
if you are taking, have recently taken or might take medicines that affect the immune system. 
This is because these may have an added effect on the immune system. 
if you plan to have any vaccinations (see “Warnings and Precautions” above). 
- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
Pregnancy 
You should avoid becoming pregnant while using Kesimpta and for 6 months after you stop using it. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If there is a possibility that you could become pregnant you should use an effective birth control 
method during treatment and for 6 months after stopping Kesimpta. Ask your doctor about the 
available options. 
If you do become pregnant or think you may be pregnant during treatment or within 6 months after the 
last dose, tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of 
Kesimpta on pregnancy. This is because Kesimpta can reduce the number of immune cells (B cells) in 
both the mother and the unborn baby. Your doctor should report your pregnancy to Novartis. You can 
also report your pregnancy by contacting the local representative of Novartis (see section 6), in 
addition to contacting your doctor. 
Breast-feeding 
Kesimpta can pass into breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks before breast-
feeding your baby while using Kesimpta. 
Vaccination of newborn babies 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before vaccinating your newborn baby if you have used 
Kesimpta during your pregnancy (see “Warnings and precautions” above). 
Driving and using machines 
Kesimpta is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
Kesimpta contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Kesimpta 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
Kesimpta is given by subcutaneous injection (injection under your skin). 
The first injection should take place under the guidance of a healthcare professional. 
Kesimpta pre-filled syringes are for single use only. 
For detailed instructions on how to inject Kesimpta, see “Instructions for use of Kesimpta pre-filled 
syringe” at the end of this leaflet. 
‘QR code to be included’ + www.kesimpta.eu

How much Kesimpta to use and how often to use it 
Do not exceed the dose prescribed by your doctor. 
- 
- 
The initial dosing is 20 mg Kesimpta administered on the first day of treatment (Week 0) and 
after 1 and 2 weeks (Week 1 and Week 2). After these first 3 injections, there is no injection in

How long to use Kesimpta 
Continue using Kesimpta every month for as long as your doctor tells you to. 
Your doctor will regularly check your condition to determine whether the treatment is having the 
desired effect. 
If you have questions about how long to use Kesimpta, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you use more Kesimpta than you should 
If you have injected too much Kesimpta, contact your doctor right away. 
If you forget to use Kesimpta 
To get the full benefit of Kesimpta, it is important that you have every injection on time. 
If you have forgotten an injection of Kesimpta, inject yourself as soon as possible. Do not wait until 
the next scheduled dose. The timing of future injections should then be calculated from the day you 
injected this dose and not based on the original schedule (see also “How much Kesimpta to use and 
how often to use it” above). 
If you stop using Kesimpta 
Do not stop using Kesimpta or change your dose without talking with your doctor. 
Some side effects can be related to a low level of B cells in your blood. After you stop treatment with 
Kesimpta your blood level of B cells will gradually increase to normal. This can take several months. 
During this time some side effects described in this leaflet may still occur. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Instructions for use of Kesimpta pre-filled syringe 
It is important that you understand and follow these instructions for use before injecting Kesimpta. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any questions before you use Kesimpta for the 
first time. 
Remember: 
• 
Do not use the Kesimpta pre-filled syringe if either the seal on the outer carton or the seal of the 
blister is broken. Keep the Kesimpta pre-filled syringe in the sealed carton until you are ready to 
use it. 
Do not shake the Kesimpta pre-filled syringe. 
The pre-filled syringe has a needle guard that will automatically cover the needle after the 
injection is finished. The needle guard helps to prevent needlestick injuries to anyone who 
handles the pre-filled syringe after injection. 
Do not remove the needle cap until just before you give the injection. 
Avoid touching the syringe guard wings before use. Touching them may cause the needle guard 
to cover the needle too early. 
Do not use if the pre-filled syringe has been dropped onto a hard surface or dropped after 
removing the needle cap. 
Dispose of the used Kesimpta pre-filled syringe immediately after use. Do not re-use a 
Kesimpta pre-filled syringe. See “How should I dispose of the used Kesimpta pre-filled 
syringe?” at the end of these Instructions for Use. 
How should I store Kesimpta? 
• 
• 
Store the Kesimpta pre-filled syringe carton in a refrigerator between 2°C and 8°C. 
Keep the Kesimpta pre-filled syringe in the original carton until ready to use to protect from 
light. 
Do not freeze the Kesimpta pre-filled syringe. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Keep Kesimpta out of the sight and reach of children.

• 
A new Kesimpta pre-filled syringe 
Not included in the carton (see Picture B): 
• 
• 
• 
1 alcohol wipe 
1 cotton ball or gauze

See “How should I dispose of the used Kesimpta pre-filled 
syringe?” at the end of these Instructions for Use. 
Prepare the Kesimpta pre-filled syringe 
Step 1. Find a clean, well-lit, flat work surface. 
Picture B 
Step 2. Take the carton containing the Kesimpta pre-filled syringe out of the refrigerator and leave it 
unopened on your work surface for about 15 to 30 minutes so that it reaches room temperature. 
Step 3. Wash your hands well with soap and water. 
Step 4. Remove the pre-filled syringe from the outer carton and take it out of the blister by holding the 
syringe guard body. 
Step 5. Look through the viewing window on the pre-filled syringe. The liquid inside should be clear 
to slightly opalescent. You may see a small air bubble in the liquid, which is normal. Do not use the 
pre-filled syringe if the liquid contains visible particles or is cloudy. 
Step 6. Do not use the pre-filled syringe if it is damaged. Return the pre-filled syringe and the package 
it came in to the pharmacy. 
Step 7. Do not use the pre-filled syringe if the expiry date 
has passed (see Picture C). Return the expired pre-filled 
syringe and its packaging to the pharmacy.

Choose and clean the injection site 
•  Areas of your body that you can use for injecting 
Kesimpta include: 
• 
• 
the front of your thighs (see Picture D) 
the lower stomach area (abdomen), but not the area 
5 cm around your navel (belly button) (see 
Picture D) 
your upper outer arms, if a caregiver or healthcare 
professional is giving you the injection (see 
Picture E). 
• 
Picture D 
Picture E 
(caregiver and healthcare 
professional only) 
•  Choose a different site each time you inject Kesimpta. 
•  Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, 
red, scaly, or hard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks 
or infection sites. 
Step 8. Using a circular motion, clean the injection site with the alcohol wipe. Leave it to dry before 
injecting. Do not touch the cleaned area again before injecting. 
Giving your injection 
Step 9. Carefully remove the needle cap from the pre-
filled syringe (see Picture F). Throw away the needle 
cap. You may see a drop of liquid at the end of the 
needle. This is normal. 
Picture F

Picture H 
Picture I 
Step 10. With one hand, gently pinch the skin at the 
injection site. With your other hand insert the needle into 
your skin as shown (see Picture G). Push the needle all 
the way in to make sure that you inject your full dose. 
Step 11. Hold the pre-filled syringe finger grips as 
shown (see Picture H). Slowly press down on the 
plunger as far as it will go, so that the plunger head is 
completely between the syringe guard wings. 
Step 12. Continue to press fully on the plunger for 
5 seconds while holding the syringe in place. 
Step 13. Slowly release the plunger until the needle is 
covered (see Picture I), and then remove the syringe 
from the injection site. 
Step 14. There may be a little blood at the injection site. 
You can press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection 
site and hold it for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection 
site. You may cover the injection site with a small 
adhesive plaster, if the bleeding continues.

closable container, or similar) (see Picture J). 
• 
Do not dispose of your used pre-filled syringe in 
your household waste. 
Never try to reuse your pre-filled syringe.

called monoclonal antibodies. 
What Kesimpta is used for 
Kesimpta is used to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). 
How Kesimpta works 
Kesimpta works by attaching to a target called CD20 on the surface of B cells. B cells are a type of 
white blood cell which are part of the immune system (the body’s defences). In multiple sclerosis, the 
immune system attacks the protective layer around nerve cells. B cells are involved in this process. 
Kesimpta targets and removes the B cells and thereby reduces the chance of a relapse, relieves 
symptoms and slows down the progression of the disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Kesimpta

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Kesimpta 
- 
Kesimpta may cause the hepatitis B virus to become active again. Your doctor will perform a 
blood test to check if you are at risk of hepatitis B infection. If this shows that you have had 
hepatitis B or are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus, your doctor will ask you to see a specialist. 
Before you start treatment with Kesimpta, your doctor may check your immune system. 
If you have an infection, your doctor may decide that you cannot be given Kesimpta or may 
delay your treatment with Kesimpta until the infection is resolved. 
Your doctor will check if you need any vaccinations before you start your treatment with 
Kesimpta. If you need a type of vaccine called a live or live-attenuated vaccine, it should be 
given at least 4 weeks before you start Kesimpta treatment. Other types of vaccines should be 
given at least 2 weeks before you start Kesimpta treatment. 
While using Kesimpta 
Tell your doctor: 
- 
if you have a general injection-related reaction or a local injection-site reaction. These are the 
most common side effects of Kesimpta treatment and are described in section 4. They usually 
occur in the 24 hours after Kesimpta is injected, in particular after the first injection. The first 
injection should take place under the guidance of a healthcare professional. 
if you have an infection. You may get infections more easily or an infection you already have 
may get worse. This is because the immune cells that Kesimpta targets also help to fight 
infection. Infections could be serious and sometimes even life-threatening. 
if you plan to have any vaccinations. Your doctor will tell you whether the vaccination you need 
is a live vaccine, a live-attenuated vaccine, or another type of vaccine. You should not be given 
live or live-attenuated vaccines during treatment with Kesimpta as this may result in infection. 
Other types of vaccines may work less well if they are given during treatment with Kesimpta. 
Tell your doctor straight away if you get any of the following during your treatment with Kesimpta, 
because they could be signs of a serious condition: 
- 
if you have rash, hives, trouble breathing, swelling of the face, eyelids, lips, mouth, tongue or 
throat, chest tightness, or feel faint. These could be signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction. 
if you think your multiple sclerosis is getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if you 
notice any new or unusual symptoms. These effects may indicate a rare brain disorder called 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is caused by a virus infection. 
- 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years of age because Kesimpta has not 
yet been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Kesimpta 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist: 
- 
if you are taking, have recently taken or might take medicines that affect the immune system. 
This is because these may have an added effect on the immune system. 
if you plan to have any vaccinations (see “Warnings and Precautions” above). 
- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
Pregnancy 
You should avoid becoming pregnant while using Kesimpta and for 6 months after you stop using it. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If there is a possibility that you could become pregnant you should use an effective birth control 
method during treatment and for 6 months after stopping Kesimpta. Ask your doctor about the 
available options. 
If you do become pregnant or think you may be pregnant during treatment or within 6 months after the 
last dose, tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of 
Kesimpta on pregnancy. This is because Kesimpta can reduce the number of immune cells (B cells) in 
both the mother and the unborn baby. Your doctor should report your pregnancy to Novartis. You can 
also report your pregnancy by contacting the local representative of Novartis (see section 6), in 
addition to contacting your doctor. 
Breast-feeding 
Kesimpta can pass into breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks before breast-
feeding your baby while using Kesimpta. 
Vaccination of newborn babies 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before vaccinating your newborn baby if you have used 
Kesimpta during your pregnancy (see “Warnings and precautions” above). 
Driving and using machines 
Kesimpta is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
Kesimpta contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.

How long to use Kesimpta 
Continue using Kesimpta every month for as long as your doctor tells you to. 
Your doctor will regularly check your condition to determine whether the treatment is having the 
desired effect. 
If you have questions about how long to use Kesimpta, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you use more Kesimpta than you should 
If you have injected too much Kesimpta, contact your doctor right away. 
If you forget to use Kesimpta 
To get the full benefit of Kesimpta, it is important that you have every injection on time. 
If you have forgotten an injection of Kesimpta, inject yourself as soon as possible. Do not wait until 
the next scheduled dose. The timing of future injections should then be calculated from the day you 
injected this dose and not based on the original schedule (see also “How much Kesimpta to use and 
how often to use it” above). 
If you stop using Kesimpta 
Do not stop using Kesimpta or change your dose without talking with your doctor. 
Some side effects can be related to a low level of B cells in your blood. After you stop treatment with 
Kesimpta your blood level of B cells will gradually increase to normal. This can take several months. 
During this time some side effects described in this leaflet may still occur. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Before your injection: 
Take the pen out of the refrigerator 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow it to reach room 
temperature. 
Step 1. Important safety checks before you inject 
(see Picture D): 
• 
Look through the viewing window. The liquid 
should be clear to slightly opalescent. 
Do not use if the liquid contains visible 
particles or is cloudy. 
You may see a small air bubble, which is 
normal. 
Look at the expiry date (EXP) on your pen. 
Do not use your pen if the expiry date has 
passed. 
•

Contact your pharmacist or healthcare professional if 
your pen fails any of these checks. 
Step 2. Choose your injection site: 
Picture E 
• 
• 
• 
The recommended site is the front of the 
thighs. You may also use the lower stomach 
area (lower abdomen), but not the area 5 cm 
around your navel (belly button) (see 
Picture E). 
Choose a different site each time you inject 
Kesimpta. 
Do not inject into areas where the skin is 
tender, bruised, red, scaly or hard. Avoid areas 
with scars or stretch marks or infection sites. 
• 
If a caregiver or healthcare professional is 
giving you your injection, they may also inject 
into your upper outer arm (see Picture F). 
Picture F 
(caregiver and healthcare professional only) 
Step 3. Clean your injection site: 
•  Wash your hands with soap and water. 
• 
Using a circular motion, clean the injection site 
with the alcohol wipe. Leave it to dry before 
injecting (see Picture G). 
Do not touch the cleaned area again before 
injecting.

Step 7. Complete your injection: 
• 
• 
• 
Listen for the second click. This indicates that 
the injection is almost complete. 
Check if the green indicator fills the window 
and has stopped moving (see Picture K). 
You can now remove the pen (see Picture L). 
After your injection: 
• 
• 
If the green indicator does not fill the window, 
this means you have not received the full dose. 
Contact your doctor or pharmacist if the green 
indicator is not visible. 
There may be a small amount of blood at the 
injection site. You can press a cotton ball or 
gauze over the injection site and hold it for 
10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You 
may cover the injection site with a small 
adhesive plaster, if the bleeding continues. 
How should I dispose of the used Kesimpta Sensoready Pen? 
Step 8. Dispose of your Kesimpta Sensoready Pen: 
• 
Dispose of the used pen in a sharps disposal 
container (i.e. a puncture-resistant closable 
container, or similar) (see Picture M). 
Never try to re-use your pen. 
• 
Keep the sharps container out of the reach of 
children.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initially applied indication for lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan was for the treatment of adult 
patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been treated with androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition and 
taxane-based chemotherapy. 
The target population of PSMA positive mCRPC who have been treated with androgen receptor (AR) 
pathway inhibition and taxane based chemotherapy is a late line advance cancer population (third 
line). It is agreed that there are limited options following progression on taxane-based chemotherapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Prostate cancer is globally the second most common cancer in men and the fifth most common cause 
of cancer death among men, with an estimated 1.4 million new cases and 375,304 cancer deaths in 
2020 worldwide (Sung et al 2021). It is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among men 
in the USA, and the third leading cause in Europe (Malvezzi et al 2019, Siegel et al 2020). In the USA, 
approximately 191,930 new cases of PC and 33,330 deaths were estimated for 2020 (American Cancer 
Society 2020), and in Europe, the corresponding estimates were 473,344 new cases and 108,088 
deaths (International Agency for Research on Cancer 2020). The median age at diagnosis of mCRPC is 
70 years (Flaig et al 2016). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Prostate-specific membrane antigen is a type II transmembrane protein, also known as folate 
hydrolase I or glutamate carboxypeptidase II, and is a biological target for diagnostic imaging and 
therapy in PC (Silver et al 1997, O’Keefe et al 2018). PSMA is highly expressed in nearly all prostate 
cancers, including adenocarcinoma, but has restricted and several hundred-fold lower expression in 
some normal tissues such as the duodenal mucosa, renal proximal tubules, and salivary glands 
(Bostwick et al 1998, Sokoloff et al 2000, Chang 2004, Ghosh and Heston 2004).  
Additionally, PSMA overexpression is correlated with advanced, high-grade, metastatic, androgen-
independent prostate cancer (Wright et al 1995, Silver et al 1997, Bostwick et al 1998, Murphy et al 
1998, Sweat et al 1998, Ross et al 2003, Chang 2004, Queisser et al 2015). 
In addition to the expression pattern, the functionality of PSMA plays an equally important role in its 
value as a tumour-specific targeting mechanism. Specifically, the binding of a high affinity ligand to 
PSMA leads to internalization through endocytosis, and a sustained retention of the ligand and its 
bound radioactive cargo within the cancer cell (Rajasekaran et al 2003, Benešová et al 2015). This 
functional feature of PSMA allows for the development of low-molecular weight targeted 
radiopharmaceuticals with favourable pharmacokinetic and tumour penetration properties, rather than 
being restricted to antibody-based targeting strategies (Haberkorn et al 2016). 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 10/122 
 
  
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Most patients with Prostate Cancer (PC) present with localized disease and undergo initial surgical 
and/or radiological therapy, with concomitant or subsequent use of ADT. Once metastasized, ADT is 
continued and is highly effective in eliciting a PSA response. Ten to twenty percent of patients with 
mPC become castration-resistant within 5 years and >50% die within 3 years with historical standard 
therapies (Nussbaum et al 2016). The 5-year survival rate is 30% in mCRPC stage. The expected OS 
remains low. In the randomized Phase III study of cabozantinib vs. prednisone in patients with mCRPC 
who had received prior docetaxel and abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide; the median OS of the 
prednisone control arm was 9.8 months (Smith et al 2016). 
Approximately 90% of patients with mCRPC develop bone metastases (Kirby et al 2011), 49% of 
whom will develop a skeletal-related event within 2 years (Saad et al 2004). Common presentations 
include bone pain, bone marrow failure, fatigue, or complications such as fractures and spinal cord 
compression. These presentations typically require radiation or bone surgery, which can significantly 
impair physical, emotional, and functional well-being (Weinfurt et al 2005). 
2.1.5.  Management 
The current standard of care in metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) is based on chemotherapy, androgen 
deprivation by different mechanisms of action on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and adrenal-
androgen receptor signaling. Standard ADT and NAADs (i.e. abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide) are 
commonly well tolerated and can stabilize metastatic castration-sensitive PCs (mCSPC) for many 
years. However, most patients eventually progress to mCRPC, which remains challenging to treat. 
Several agents have been approved for the treatment of mCRPC. NCCN, ASCO, ESMO, and APCCC 
guidelines provide some consensus and guidance for their use, but there is no proper sequence for 
delivery of these agents in patients with mCRPC. Regardless, none of these therapies has been proven 
to prolong survival after NAAD (novel androgen axis drug) therapies. 
Taxane-based chemotherapies and androgen axis inhibitors are the most commonly used agents for 
patients with mCRPC (Tannock et al 2004, de Bono et al 2010, de Bono et al 2011, Scher et al 2012), 
and only one study (the CARD study) has demonstrated efficacy after progression has occurred 
following treatment with these agents (Gillessen et al 2020). In the CARD study, cabazitaxel was more 
effective than switching from abiraterone to enzalutamide, or vice-versa, in both prolonging imaging-
based progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with progression after docetaxel and 
either abiraterone or enzalutamide (de Wit et al, 2019). Other treatment options in this population 
include bone-directed radiotherapy with 223radium for those with symptomatic bone dominant 
disease, immunotherapy with sipuleucel-T, and poly ADPribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in those 
with specified HRR defects (Kantoff et al 2010, Parker et al 2013, Abida et al 2020, Anscher et al 2020, 
de Bono et al 2020, Hussain et al 2020). 
In clinical practice, NAADs are often used in the first-line mCRPC setting. Sipuleucel-T is most 
commonly used in mildly asymptomatic small-volume disease, while 223Ra dichloride is used to treat 
patients with bone-only disease. Taxane-based chemotherapy (i.e. docetaxel and cabazitaxel) is used 
after abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide and for symptomatic patients, particularly with visceral 
disease. Docetaxel is used more commonly (Flaig et al 2016), and cabazitaxel was specifically designed 
for antitumor activity in docetaxel-resistant patients (de Wit et al 2019). Because both agents have a 
typical chemotherapy side-effect profile (including bone marrow suppression), they are often not 
considered due to multiple comorbidities, poor hematological reserve, or patient refusal (Zielinski et al 
2014). When the approved second-line treatments (e.g. abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide) are used 
in the third line setting, they do not retain the same levels of activity as when used in second line. 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 11/122 
 
  
 
 
NAADs in patients previously exposed to a taxane and either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide 
produce only modest activity in terms of PSA decline, and PFS and OS benefit (Loriot et al 2013, 
Noonan et al 2013, Azad et al 2015, Brasso et al 2015, Cheng et al 2015). 
As NAADs have been used in earlier lines of therapy, the use of a second NAAD following docetaxel has 
resulted in diminished efficacy, likely due to cross resistance. In summary, although the therapeutic 
landscape of mCRPC has broadened over the last decade, deaths due to mCRPC are still rising in these 
patients, many of whom are frail and elderly. 
There are limited options available to patients who fail taxane-based chemotherapy or for whom 
taxane-based chemotherapy is contraindicated or not appropriate, particularly if alternative agents 
currently approved in this setting (NAADs) have been used earlier in the disease. 
Given the limited treatment options following prostate cancer progression, there is a clear necessity for 
improved treatment regimens with a significant antitumor effect and minimal toxicity. 
Targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) offers the possibility to treat prostate cancer lesions in a specific 
and tumor-selective manner by exploiting cell surface proteins mainly expressed on malignant cells. 
The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a promising RLT target because it is highly 
expressed in PC, including mCRPC, but it has low and restricted expression in normal tissues (Bostwick 
et al 1998, Sokoloff et al 2000, Chang 2004, Ghosh and Heston 2004). This differential in expression 
provides a mechanism by which targeted therapeutic radiation can be delivered to cancer cells via 
PSMA while minimizing radiation-related side effects. PSMA-targeted RLT utilizes a radiolabeled small-
molecule ligand that targets and binds with high affinity to PSMA, resulting in internalization and 
retention within the targeted PC cell (Ghosh and Heston 2004, Benešová et al 2015), to treat PSMA-
positive mCRPC. 
177Lu-PSMA-617 has been used experimentally in the clinic since 2013 for the treatment of patients 
with mCRPC (Ahmadzadehfar et al 2015). As a result, published data on efficacy (and safety) of 177Lu-
PSMA-617 in patients with mCRPC is available from many centers. Moreover, PSMA ligand can be also 
radiolabeled with gallium
extent of disease by PET imaging. Therefore, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging is used as a component of 
68 (68Ga) and used to identify PSMA expression and determine the local 
eligibility criteria. 
‐
While the efficacy results from the retrospective studies are encouraging, the data from the 
prospective studies are important as these studies involved well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
careful patient selection via 68Ga-PSMA-11 and FDG PET/CT imaging, and prespecified data collection 
and analysis (Emmett et al 2019, Violet et al 2020, Hofman et al 2021).  
2.2.  About the product 
PSMA-617, the non-radioactive precursor molecule, consists of the PSMA-binding ligand glutamate-
urea-lysine, a DOTA-chelator, and a linker connecting these 2 entities. This is then complexed with the 
lutetium radionuclide, and the radioactive nature of lutetium-177 is responsible for the therapeutic 
activity of 177Lu-PSMA-617.  
The mechanism of action of 177Lu-PSMA-617 is to deliver therapeutic radiation to prostate cancer cells 
via its binding to PSMA.  
By design, 177Lu-PSMA-617 exhibits high PSMA binding affinity and internalization, prolonged tumor 
retention, and rapid kidney clearance (Benešová et al 2015) that was further supported by published 
dosimetry studies (Delker et al 2016, Kratochwil et al 2016, Kabasakal et al 2017, Scarpa et al 2017, 
Yadav et al 2017).

While PSMA-617 has the capacity to chelate other radionuclides, Lu-177 is the radionuclide of choice 
for this application, based on its favorable radiochemical characteristics, including half-life and the path 
length of the β-particles (Sgouros et al 2020). Lu-177 is a medium-energy β-emitter (497 keV) with a 
maximal tissue penetration of approximately 2 mm (mean=0.67 mm) and a physical half-life of 6.647 
days (Deepa et al 2011, Dash et al 2015). The shorter β-range of Lu-177 provides better irradiation of 
small tumors, in contrast to the longer β-range of Y-90 (Emmett et al 2017). The shorter path length 
also acts to direct the energy within the tumor rather than into the surrounding normal tissues, while 
the path length is still sufficient to create bystander and crossfire effects within the tumor lesion. Lu-
177 also has a relatively long physical half-life that, combined with the high intratumoral retention of 
177Lu-PSMA-617, reduces the dosing frequency. The retention half-life of the 177Lu-PSMA-617 molecule 
in the tumor lesion has been reported to be between 60 and 160 hours, which is comparable to the 
161-hour physical half-life of Lu-177 (Kratochwil et al 2019). 
In this document, the therapeutic agent lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan ([177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 / 
company research code: AAA617) is referred to as 177Lu-PSMA-617, and the radiolabeled compound 
gallium (68Ga) gozetotide ([68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 / company research code: AAA517) is referred to as 
68Ga-PSMA-11. 
The relevant pharmacotherapeutic group is “Other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals” (ATC code: 
V10XX05). 
The initially applied indication for lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan was for the treatment of adult 
patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been treated with androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition and 
taxane-based chemotherapy. 
The finally agreed indication is Pluvicto in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with 
or without androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition for the treatment of adult patients with 
progressive prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been treated with AR pathway inhibition and taxane-based 
chemotherapy. 
The recommended treatment regimen of Pluvicto is 7 400 MBq intravenously every 6 weeks (±1 week) 
for up to a total of 6 doses, unless there is disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Pluvicto should be administered only by persons authorised to handle radiopharmaceuticals in 
designated clinical settings (see section SmPC 6.6) and after evaluation of the patient by a qualified 
physician. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that approved 
treatments exist for (at least) part of the target population and that other comparable 177Lu-PSMA 
products are available in clinical practice in the EU.

The finished product is presented as solution for injection/infusion. One mL of solution contains 1 000 
MBq of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan at the date and time of calibration as active substance. 
The total amount of radioactivity per single-dose vial is 7 400 MBq ± 10% at the date and time of 
administration. Given the fixed volumetric activity of 1 000 MBq/mL at the date and time of calibration, 
the volume of the solution in the vial can range from 7.5 mL to 12.5 mL in order to provide the 
required amount of radioactivity at the date and time of administration. 
Other ingredients are: acetic acid, sodium acetate, gentisic acid, sodium ascorbate, pentetic acid 
(DTPA), and water for injections. 
The product is available in clear, colourless type I glass vial, closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper 
and aluminium seal. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The manufacture of the active substance Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan (177Lu-PSMA-617) 
involves a radionuclide precursor (Lutetium (177Lu) chloride)  and a cold chemical precursor (vipivotide 
tetraxetan, or PSMA-617). 
During evaluation, it was considered that the provided description of the manufacturing of the 
radionuclide precursor Lutetium-177 chloride for radiolabelling in part S.2.3 provides only an abstract 
of its manufacturing process. As result of the key role of the radionuclide precursor Lutetium-177 its 
manufacturing process should be detailed documented, according to the guideline on 
radiopharmaceuticals, it was requested to provide this information as a separate complete modules 
3.2.S or alternatively, in an ASMF as Major Objection (MO). The applicant informed that the precursor 
Lutetium-177 used in this marketing authorisation application is the same that for the marketing 
authorisations for Lumark and EndolucinBeta (both authorised centrally) except in view to the 
radioactive concentration. Considering that the radionuclide precursor [177Lu]Lutetium chloride used is 
manufactured from the same starting material sources and the same manufacturing lines / procedures 
under the same standards inclusive GMP and specifications where the authorised products Lumark and 
EndolucinBeta are manufactured, except in view to the radioactive concentration and absolute 
radioactive amount the quality of the radionuclide precursor [177Lu]Lutetium chloride is sufficiently 
assured and no need to provide more information is considered necessary. 
In line with the Guideline on Radiopharmaceuticals a separate module 3.2.S is presented for the cold 
radioactive chemical precursor vipivotide tetraxetan.

with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing has 
been presented. 
Batch  analysis  data  9  commercial  and  pilot  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  are  provided.  The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 and 6 commercial scale batches in bulk and aliquot in vials respectively of vipivotide 
tetraxetan  from  the  proposed  manufacturer  stored  in  the  intended  commercial  package  for  up to  36 
months  data  for  the  bulk,  long-term  storage  condition  of  -20°C.For  the  vials,  36  months  data  are 
available at intermediate storage conditions of 5°C. In addition, stability studies have been performed 
at accelerated conditions (40°C / 75 % RH and 50 °C/75 % RH) over 14 days.

conditions but remained within the specification. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently  stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  of  36  months  The  reported 
stability studies support a 36-month re-test period when stored at -20°C in the proposed container. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as clear, colourless to slightly yellow solution. 
The finished product was developed as a ready to use radiopharmaceutical solution for injection/infusion 
containing the active substance with a volumetric activity of 1000 MBq/mL at reference date and time 
(calibration time (tc)). . 
The  compatibility  of  the  active  substance  with  the  excipients  has  been  demonstrated  throughout  the 
batch analyses and the stability studies performed on the finished product. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards except acetic acid, sodium acetate and gentisic acid which comply with In house specifications. 
Pentetic  acid  is  compliant  with  USP/NF.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC . 
The  overall  manufacturing  process  developed  involves  an  automated  continuous  process,  where  the 
synthesis of the active substance is also part of the finished product manufacturing process and follows 
conventional  drug  compounding  and  aseptic  filling  methods  commonly  used  in  the  pharmaceutical 
industry.    During  the  manufacturing  process  development  of  the  finished  product,  critical  process 
parameters were identified, evaluated and optimized. These efforts aimed at achieving a stable finished 
product with a suitable method of sterilization while maintaining the integrity of the finished product. 
The finished product is a ready to use radiopharmaceutical product provided in a single dose vial for slow 
intravenous administration.The primary packaging is clear,  colourless type  I glass  vial,  closed  with  a 
bromobutyl  rubber  stopper  and  aluminium  seal.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by one manufacturing site. 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 18/122 
 
  
 
 
The finished product manufacturing process consists of 8 main steps: preparation of the dispensing cell 
and dilution solution, measurement of volumetric activity and transfer, formulation of the bulk solution, 
homogenization  of  the  bulk  solution,  final  sterilizing  filtration  and  dispensing  of  the  finished  product, 
measurement of weight and radioactivity of the finished product vial, andloading into shielded secondary 
container. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process of the finished product has been validated using six full-scale production 
batches which have been processed in the same manufacturing facilities using the same process and 
the same type of equipment as for the batches intended for commercial supply.  
All six batches fully met the quality control specifications. The in-process data and the results from 
additional  testing  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  robust  and  consistently  yields  a 
product  capable  of  meeting  the  pre-defined  quality  characteristics.  The  in-process  controls  are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Validation studies have been performed to demonstrate the suitability of manufacturing conditions in 
order to guarantee consistent and reproducible quality of the finished product at the manufacturing 
site.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and stability testing specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage  form:  appearance  (visual),  pH,  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (UV,  RP-UV-HPLC),  chemical  purity  (peptide 
purity) (RP-UV-HPLC), radiochemical purity (RP-γβ-HPLC, ITLC, Gamma spectrometry), identification 
(RP-γβ-HPLC),  specific  activity  (HPLC),  volumetric  activity  (dose  calibration/balance),  filter  integrity 
(Ph.  Eur.),  radionuclide  identity  half  time  determination  (dose  calibration),  bacterial  endotoxins  (Ph. 
Eur.), and sterility (Ph. Eur.)  
The  total  amount  of  radiochemical  impurities  is  limited  to  ≤  5  %  at  the  end  of  shelf-life  which  is  in 
conformity  with  the  guideline  on  radiopharmaceuticals.    No  impurities  generated  during  the 
manufacturing process of the active substance and the finished product have been observed above the 
specification limit, in any of the batches addressed. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data using 
a  validated  ICP/OES  method  was  provided,  demonstrating  that  each  relevant elemental  impurity  was 
not detected above the limit of the respective PDE.  Based on the risk assessment and the presented 
batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls product 
specification.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has  been  performed  (as  requested)  considering  all  suspected  and  actual  root  causes  in  line  with  the 
“Questions  and  answers  for  marketing  authorisation  holders/applicants  on  the  CHMP  Opinion  for  the 
Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on 
the  information  provided,  it  is  accepted  that  there  is  no  risk  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing has 
been presented. 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 19/122 
 
  
 
 
Batch analysis results confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture 
to the intended product specification.  
The  finished  product  is  released  on  the  market  based  on  the  above  release  specifications,  through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 6 commercial scale batches of finished product  stored for up to 5 days under long 
term conditions (5 ± 3°C, 25 ± 2°C), intermediate conditions (30 ± 2°C) and accelerated conditions (40 
± 2°C)) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the medicinal product are identical 
to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested per the stability indicating specifications: the parameters tested and 
analytical methods used were stability indicating. 
The finished product did not show any significant changes whilst stored during 5 days at 5 ± 3°C, 25 ± 
2°C, 30 ± 2°C, 40 ± 2°C Under these conditions, all the physical-chemical and microbiological results 
comply with the specifications until the end of the shelf-life.  
Gentisic acid and sodium ascorbate are known to be photosensitive substances. However, photostability 
testing was not performed as the finished product is intended to be stored in its secondary packaging 
(made of lead pot) until end of shelf-life including the administration timeframe due to radiation-safety 
purposes.  Based  on  this  assessment  the  photostability  risk  degradation  is  considered  negligible  and 
photostability has not been further investigated nor included in the stability protocol. This was considered 
satisfactory. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 120 hours (5 days) from the date and time 
of calibration and store in the original package in order to protect from ionising radiation (lead shielding) 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
 No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
One MO has been raised to provide information of the manufacturing process of the radionuclide 
precursor Lutetium-177 as a separate complete module 3.2.S or alternatively, in an ASMF. The 
applicant informed that Lutetium-177 used in this application is the same that for the marketing 
authorizations for Lumark and EndolucinBeta (both authorized centrally). Considering that the quality 
of the precursor is sufficiently assured, no need to provide more information was considered 
necessary. 
Overall, during the procedure, the information of the dossier has been updated and improved as 
requested.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The  proposed  indication  is  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  prostate-specific  membrane  antigen 
(PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been treated with 
androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy. 177Lu vipivotide tetraxetan, 
also  referred  to  as  [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617  or  177Lu-PSMA-617,  is  PSMA-targeted  radioligand  therapy 
developed to treat mCRPC. 
PSMA is a type II transmembrane protein, also known as folate hydrolase or glutamate carboxypeptidase 
II, and has been confirmed as a biological target for therapy in prostate cancer. PSMA is highly expressed 
in  nearly  all  prostate  cancers,  but  has  restricted  and  several  hundred-fold  lower  expression  in  some 
normal tissues such as the duodenal mucosa, renal proximal tubules, and salivary glands. Additionally, 
PSMA  overexpression  is  correlated  with  advanced,  high-grade,  metastatic,  androgen-independent 
prostate cancer. The differential expression of PSMA from tumour to non-tumour tissue supports targeted 
strategies involving radiotherapeutic intervention. 
The non-clinical program has been designed according to ICH (International Council for Harmonisation) 
S9  guideline  on  non-clinical  evaluation  for  anticancer  pharmaceuticals  and  CHMP  Guideline  on  the 
nonclinical requirements for radiopharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018). 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
PSMA is expressed in nearly all prostate cancers, and its overexpression correlates with a metastatic 
and hormone-refractory condition. 177Lu-PSMA-617 is a PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy developed 
for mCRPC treatment. The PSMA-617 molecule consists of three components: the PSMA-targeting 
pharmacophore glutamate-urea-lysine, the metal chelator DOTA, and a linker connecting these two 
moieties. Lu-177 is the radionuclide incorporated into the DOTA chelator of PSMA-617, and its 
radioactivity is responsible for the therapeutic activity of 177Lu-PSMA-617. The mechanism of action of 
177Lu-PSMA-617 is thus to deliver therapeutic radiation to cancer cells via its binding to PSMA. 
The binding affinity of PSMA-617 and the non-radioactive natLu-labelled PSMA-617 in LNCaP (Lymph 
node carcinoma of the prostate) cells was in nanomolar range (Ki = 2.34±2.94 nM for unlabelled 
PSMA-617, and Ki = 6.91±1.32 nM for the lutetium complex). The in vitro uptake of 177Lu-PSMA-617 
into PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumour cells was approximately 55–70%, and the internalised fraction 
was about 10 to 15% of total added radioactivity. In contrast, the uptake in PSMA-negative PC-3 flu 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 21/122 
 
  
 
 
tumour cells did not exceed 0.5%. PSMA-dependent uptake of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was confirmed in vivo 
in mice bearing both PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP and -negative PC-3 flu prostate cancer xenografts. Initial 
high uptake in kidneys was quickly cleared. PSMA-specific uptake was further demonstrated in LNCaP 
tumour xenografts in mice as 177Lu-PSMA-617 uptake in these PSMA-positive tumours could be blocked 
by the selective PSMA inhibitor 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid. 
The Lu-177-induced cancer cell death is the result of both direct effects of radiation on cellular DNA, as 
well as indirect DNA-damaging effects from reactive species formed from upon irradiation. The physical 
half-life of Lu-177 is 6.647 days combined with the intratumoural retention of 177Lu-PSMA-617 allows 
for the continued irradiation of the lesions. A maximal radiation penetration of less than 2 mm into 
tissues ensures a reduced exposure to neighbouring normal cells. 177Lu-PSMA-617 exhibited in vitro 
cytotoxicity in PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP cells but not in PSMA-negative PC-3 flu cells. In vivo, C57BL/6 
immunocompetent mice bearing tumour xenografts created from murine prostate cancer cell lines that 
have been transfected to express human PSMA (RM1-hPSMA) exhibited a specific activity-dependent 
increase in tumour uptake after treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 at different formulations for high, 
intermediate or low specific activity (corresponding to low, intermediate and high amount of mass 
having the same level of total radioactivity). This improved biodistribution resulted in improved anti-
tumour activity demonstrated as a decrease in tumour volume and an increase in overall survival. 
Higher specific activity treatments caused more DNA double-strand breaks. When radioactivity levels 
were varied in high specific activity formulation, 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment led to dose-dependent 
therapeutic activity in the RM1-PGLS mouse model of prostate cancer. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
At the concentration of 10 µM, 175Lu-PSMA-617 was found not to interact with a panel of 87 potential 
different targets (receptors, ion channels, enzymes and transporters). This concentration is 
approximately 132-fold higher than the theoretical clinical Cmax of the total PSMA-617 in patients 
(around 76 nM) following an administration of 177Lu-PSMA-617. 175Lu-PSMA-617 (cold-labelled) and 
PSMA-617 (unlabelled) exhibited no cytotoxic effect on PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative human cancer 
cell lines at the concentrations up to 10 µM suggesting that cytotoxicity of 177Lu-PSMA-617 (as 
described in section 2.5.2.1 Primary pharmacodynamic studies) is dependent on the presence of the 
radioactive Lu-177. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
A 175Lu-PSMA-617/PSMA-617 solution (1:1) at the concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 µM (total PSMA-617 
content) inhibited hERG tail current by 8±4%, 8±0%, and 13±2%, respectively. The control analytical 
measurements revealed the PSMA-617 concentration to be out of range. Thus, the cells were 
underexposed to PSMA-617 between 68.64% and 88.03% of the nominal concentrations (i.e. 0.34 µM 
and 44 µM). Nevertheless, given the theoretical clinical Cmax of ca. 76 nM the highest concentration 
used in this assay was ca. 580-fold higher than the theoretical clinical Cmax, and no clinically relevant 
hERG inhibition is expected 
In vivo GLP safety pharmacology studies were performed in rats and minipigs. Rovenska et al 2008 
showed that PSMA is expressed in rats, minipigs and humans, is highly conserved and has similar 
enzymatic activity across the species. Therefore, rats and minipigs are considered pharmacologically 
relevant species. A 175Lu-PSMA-617 solution (containing the non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 and 
unlabelled PSMA-617) had no effect on general behaviour parameters (Irwin test) in male Sprague-
Dawley rats after single intravenous administration at doses up to 1.8 mg/kg. An intravenous 175Lu-
PSMA-617 solution did not influence respiratory function of the conscious male Sprague-Dawley rats up 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 22/122 
 
  
 
 
to 1.8 mg/kg. No effects of this test item on cardiovascular system were observed in conscious 
telemetered minipigs up to 1.0 mg/kg. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted as lutetium vipivotide tetraxetan is 
targeted to PSMA, which is specifically expressed in prostate cancer. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Tissue biodistribution studies were conducted with 177Lu-PSMA-617 in a mouse tumour model and in 
healthy rats. In these studies, the test article was a 177Lu-PSMA-617 formulation resembling the one 
used in humans. This test formulation contains both 177Lu-PSMA-617 as well as unlabelled PSMA-617, 
as not all PSMA-617 molecules are radiolabelled with Lu-177 following the chelation procedure. In vitro 
studies were performed to characterise plasma protein binding, blood-to-plasma distribution, and 
metabolic stability of non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 and the unlabelled PSMA-617 precursor (as a 
surrogate for 177Lu-PSMA-617 formulation) in the animal toxicity species (rat and minipig) and in 
human. 
2.5.3.1.  Methods of analysis 
The analytical methods for quantification of 175Lu-PSMA-617 and PSMA-617 in vehicle by LC-UV, in 
Tyrode’s solution by HPLC-UV and in rat and minipig plasma by LC-MS/MS were developed and in 
general successfully validated under GLP conditions as most of the acceptance criteria for validation 
were met. For the methods to determine 175Lu-PSMA-617 and PSMA-617 in vehicle and Tyrode’s 
solution, linearity was shown in a narrower concentration range than the quantification range of the 
method. However, the samples were diluted to fall within the range of the calibration curve. During 
development of the bioanalytical method in rat plasma, a carryover effect was observed in roughly a 
quarter of the validation samples. Therefore, preventive measures have been applied during 
bioanalytical measurements in toxicokinetic studies, i.e. blank samples were inserted after samples 
likely to have high concentrations. This is acceptable. Upon development of the bioanalytical method 
for PSMA-617 in minipig plasma, a matrix effect was observed at the QCH level and a possible impact 
of this effect cannot be ruled out completely. 
2.5.3.2.  Absorption 
Classical pharmacokinetics describing compound plasma levels was investigated within toxicokinetic 
studies in rats and minipigs using non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 and unlabelled PSMA-617 and is 
described in detail in Toxicology section. 
2.5.3.3.  Distribution 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 and unlabelled PSMA-617 to 
human, rat and minipig plasma was found to be moderate for both compounds, with the highest values 
observed in human. In the case of 175Lu-PSMA-617, the protein binding varied between 62 and 70% in 
human, between 52 and 60% in rat, and 57 and 63% in minipig plasma. For PSMA-617, it was 58–
70% in human, 47–59% in rat, and 54– 58% in minipig plasma.  
175Lu-PSMA-617 and unlabelled PSMA-617 both did not preferentially distribute into erythrocytes as the 
mean blood-to-plasma ratios were below 1 (175Lu-PSMA-617: 0.34 for mouse, 0.45 for rat, 0.43 for 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 23/122 
 
  
 
 
dog, 0.55 for minipig, and 0.49 for human; PSMA-617: 0.40 for mouse, 0.35 for rat, 0.96 for dog, 0.42 
for minipig, and 0.28 for human). 
In vivo, 177Lu-PSMA-617 quickly accumulated in PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumour xenografts of female 
athymic nude Balb/c mice up to a maximum of 56.0±8.0% injected activity /g after 4 h post-injection. 
On the contrary, in PSMA-negative PC-3 flu tumours of the same animals the accumulated radioactivity 
was clearly below the blood level, indicating PSMA-specific accumulation of the radioligand. The initial 
uptake of in the kidneys was cleared quickly, resulting in renal retention of ca. 3% injected activity /g 
after 6 h post-injection.  
In normal male Wistar rats, the radioligand was rapidly cleared from blood with distribution at the 
initial time point in liver, intestine, kidneys, muscle and skeleton. Despite initial accumulation of 
radioactivity in blood and muscle, it was completely cleared at 24 h post-injection. Retention of 
residual radioactivity was observed in the intestine, liver, kidneys and skeleton at 24 h. However, 
uptake in these organs, except skeleton, gradually decreased over time. In contrast, the amount of 
radioactivity in the skeleton remained constant up to 7 days post-administration. As no uptake and no 
retention of radioactivity was observed in normal bone in patients, the observation of persistent 
accumulation and retention of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in the skeleton of rats is considered not to be clinically 
relevant. 
The effect of injected peptide amounts on the biodistribution of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was studied in healthy 
male Sprague-Dawley rats after single intravenous bolus tail vein injection. Three different peptide 
doses (unlabelled PSMA-617) were evaluated (0.21, 2.1 and 21 μg) resulting in peptide amounts of 
1.1±0.1, 9.8±0.9, 109.3±13.7 μg/kg rat body weight, which corresponds to a human dose of 74±7, 
683±60, 7654±961 μg/70 kg body weight, respectively. No differences in the blood clearance of 177Lu-
PSMA-617 were observed, it was comparable with half-lives of 0.49 hours, 0.49 hours, and 0.5 hours 
for the different peptide amounts (0.21, 2.1 and 21 μg), respectively. The distribution of 177Lu-PSMA-
617 was unspecific for all doses, with the exception of the kidneys. There was no uptake in the brain. 
177Lu-PSMA-617 exhibited high initial accumulation in the kidneys; however, the radioactivity was 
rapidly eliminated. The kidney uptake was decreased with increasing peptide amount (1.1 μg/kg body 
weight – 36.6±12.9%, 9.8 μg/kg body weight – 6.2±0.5%, 109.3 μg/kg body weight – 1.8±0.1% 
injected dose, respectively). 
2.5.3.4.  Metabolism 
Non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 and unlabelled PSMA-617 were found to be metabolically stable in 
human, rat and minipig plasma (for 2 h) and in liver and kidney S9 fractions (for 60 min.) of the same 
species at 37 °C. Lauric acid chosen by the Applicant as a positive control in metabolic assays in kidney 
S9 fractions shows the highest turnover (lauric acid hydroxylation) compared to other substrates such 
as NADPH cytochrome c reductase or glucuronidation of 4-methylumbelliferone. Compound loss 
measured in the positive controls in study 0591 were within or above the rate specified in the product 
specification. 
2.5.3.5.  Excretion 
In healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats, 177Lu-PSMA-617 specifically accumulated only in the kidneys but 
was not retained there as the radioactivity was rapidly eliminated. After 24 h, only 0.4% injected dose 
was found in the kidneys, and more than 97% injected dose was present in the urine. Similar findings 
were obtained in male Wistar rats, which excreted >80% of the injected 177Lu-PSMA-617 radioactivity 
within 3 hours via renal route.

2.5.3.6.  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro studies of the potential of the 175Lu-PSMA-617 test solution (a mixture of 175Lu-labeled PSMA-
617 and unlabelled PSMA-617) to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes 
revealed that the test item is not a reversible or time-dependent inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, as the IC50 values could not be determined. 
The EC50 values for induction of CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 metabolic activity by the 175Lu-PSMA-617 test 
solution as specified above were determined as of 16.6, 50.7 and 1.57 µg/mL, respectively. This 
corresponds to 15.9, 48.6 and 1.5 µM PSMA-617, which exceeds the theoretical clinical Cmax of ca. 76 
nM more than 19-fold. Therefore, no clinical relevance is expected.  
The induction potential was evaluated on activity level, and not primarily on mRNA level as suggested 
by the EMA guideline on the investigation of drug interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**). 
In vitro drug interaction studies with transporters showed that 175Lu-PSMA-617 solution is not an 
inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MATE1, MATE2-K, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. 
175Lu-PSMA-617 solution was found to be not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MATE2-K, OCT2, 
OAT1, and OAT3. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Toxicology of a non-radioactive mixture of 175Lu-PSMA-617 and unlabelled PSMA-617 (1:1) was 
assessed in extended single dose toxicity studies in rats and minipigs. 
At single iv doses up to 4.0 mg/kg in the rat and 1.8 mg/kg in the minipig, no mortality and no major 
adverse effects were observed. In the rat, only minor changes with respect to haematological and 
biochemical aspects occurred. Only one female animal of the high dose group revealed macroscopic 
and microscopic changes of the right kidney (single, pale area with unilateral M-nephroblastoma). This 
might be an incidental or spontaneous effect but in view of the fact that the kidneys are a primary site 
of PSMA uptake and that 177Lu-PSMA-617 is rapidly excreted through the kidneys, it cannot be 
excluded that nephrotoxicity might be a serious adverse event after repeated treatment in the clinical 
setting. The NOAEL was considered to be 4.0 mg in the rat study, which represents a safety margin of 
150 based on body surface area scaling relative to the maximum potential human dose of 275 µg.  
In the minipig, no treatment related changes were noted with the exception of adverse effects at the 
injection site: minimal or mild acute inflammation associated with vascular and perivascular necrosis 
was seen in animals treated at all doses. The NOAEL was set 1.8 mg/kg, which corresponds to an 
approximately 400-fold safety margin, based on body surface area scaling relative to the maximum 
potential human dose of 275 µg.  
However, in the in vitro pharmacology study Cmax was calculated after a bolus injection of 200 µg and 
not 275 µg.  
The estimated exposure multiples of the single-dose toxicity studies (150 and 400 in rats and minipigs, 
respectively) were based on the potential maximum human dose of 275 µg whereas the maximum 
theoretical concentration value (Cmax) in the in vitro secondary pharmacology study (Study 
100053460-4) was calculated after a bolus injection of 200 µg. The 275 µg mass dose provides the 
most conservative estimate and provides a safety margin of 132-fold. Due to the discrepancy between 
the two studies, this value was recalculated using the 200 mg mass dose leading to a 94-fold margin 
instead of the initial calculated 132-fold margin. This new value provides a sufficient margin. 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 25/122 
 
  
 
 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
In the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, unlabelled PSMA-617 was 
administered once a week via the intravenous route for up to 23 days (total of 4 administrations). The 
doses were 0, 0.04, 0.16 and 0.40 mg/kg. There was no mortality associated with PSMA-617. A slight 
increase in the relative weight for testis and kidney at the highest dose tested was recorded as well as 
a minimal decrease of monocytes and creatinine. Microscopic changes such as inflammation in the 
kidney or lymphocytic infiltration in the epididymides were recorded but were of low incidence. The 
NOAEL was set 0.4 mg/kg, which represents a safety margin of 15 based on body surface area scaling 
relative to the maximum potential human dose of 275 µg. The results underline the assumption that 
PSMA-617 is well tolerated. No TK data were collected and no recovery period was included in the 
study.  
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Unlabelled PSMA-617 was negative for genotoxicity in a bacterial mutagenicity assay. However, given 
that the human drug product is radiolabelled, genotoxicity is expected. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with 177Lu-PSMA-617, the unlabelled precursor 
molecule PSMA-617, or non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 as they are not required according to the 
relevant guidelines. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Studies on reproductive and developmental toxicity have not been performed with 177Lu-PSMA-617, 
the unlabelled precursor molecule PSMA-617, or non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 and are not required 
for an anticancer radioactive agent due to the radioactive nature of 177Lu and thus its DNA reactivity, 
which would likely result in toxic reproductive and developmental effects. This is in accordance with the 
ICH S9 guidance, CHMP draft guidance (EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018) and Oncology Therapeutic 
Radiopharmaceuticals: Nonclinical Studies and Labeling Recommendations Guidance for Industry, 
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) August 2019. In addition, since men are the intended 
patient population, the complete program of reproductive toxicity studies is per se not required. 
Considering the maximum radiation absorbed dose to the testes of 6.22 Gy 177Lu-PSMA-617 has the 
potential to cause infertility in male patients. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance studies were performed. The local tolerance after iv administration is 
considered adequately assessed in the performed iv single and repeat-dose toxicology studies. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Assuming one treatment per year, resulting in maximal 6 applications, the PECsurfacewater can be 
calculated to 0.000023 µg/L. Consequently, a Phase II assessment is not necessary.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
PSMA overexpression is specifically localised in prostate cancers and correlates with a metastatic and 
hormone-refractory disease. Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan (177Lu-PSMA-617) is a PSMA-
targeted radioligand therapy developed for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer. The mechanism of action of 177Lu-PSMA-617 is to deliver therapeutic radiation from Lu-177 
selectively to cancer cells via the high affinity binding to PSMA. 177Lu-PSMA-617 was demonstrated to 
specifically accumulate in PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells in vitro and in PSMA-positive tumours in 
vivo. Initially high uptake in kidneys was quickly cleared. The compound exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity 
only in PSMA-positive cancer cells. Mice bearing tumour xenografts created from murine prostate 
cancer cell lines that have been transfected to express human PSMA (RM1-hPSMA) showed a specific 
activity-dependent increase in tumour uptake after treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617, which resulted in a 
decrease in tumour volume and an increase in overall survival. Furthermore, the compound 
demonstrated a dose-dependent therapeutic activity in the RM1-PGLS mouse model of prostate cancer. 
175Lu-PSMA-617 had no off-target activity further confirming its high selectivity for PSMA. 175Lu-PSMA-
617 (cold-labelled) and PSMA-617 (unlabelled) were both not cytotoxic in PSMA-positive or PSMA-
negative human cancer cell lines suggesting radioactivity-dependent cytotoxicity of 177Lu-PSMA-617. A 
175Lu-PSMA-617/PSMA-617 solution (1:1) did not inhibit hERG tail current in vitro and had no effects 
on central nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory systems in rats and minipigs that are considered 
pharmacologically relevant models. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The analytical methods for quantification of 175Lu-PSMA-617 and PSMA-617 in vehicle by LC-UV, in 
Tyrode’s solution by HPLC-UV and in rat and minipig plasma by LC-MS/MS were developed and in 
general successfully validated under GLP conditions. For the methods to determine 175Lu-PSMA-617 
and PSMA-617 in vehicle and Tyrode’s solution, linearity was shown in a narrower concentration range 
than the quantification range of the method. However, samples were diluted to fall into the range of 
the calibration curve. Upon development of the bioanalytical method for PSMA-617 in minipig plasma, 
a matrix effect was observed at the QCH level and a possible impact of the matrix effect cannot be 
ruled out completely. However, as matrix effects are more likely at lower analyte concentrations, the 
Applicant presumed that the occurrence of the matrix effect at QCH for PSMA-617 may be due to an 
error in the preparation of Matrix Factor samples. The matrix effect was not observed for [175Lu]Lu-
PSMA-617. Nevertheless, the PK parameters were comparable between [175Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and 
PSMA-617. Thus, it was concluded that the relevance for the conclusions of the TK study is negligible. 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 and unlabelled PSMA-617 to 
human, rat and minipig plasma was moderate. Both compounds did not preferentially distribute into 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 27/122 
 
  
 
 
 
 
erythrocytes as the mean blood-to-plasma ratios were below 1. In vivo, 177Lu-PSMA-617 quickly 
accumulated in PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumour xenografts of mice but not in concomitantly present 
PSMA-negative PC-3 flu tumours. The initial uptake in the kidneys was cleared quickly. In healthy rats, 
the radioligand was rapidly cleared from blood and distributed to liver, intestine, kidneys, muscle and 
skeleton. However, uptake in these organs, except skeleton, gradually decreased over time. The 
amount of radioactivity in the skeleton remained constant up to 7 days post-administration. As no 
uptake and no retention of radioactivity was observed in normal bone in patients, the observation of 
persistent accumulation and retention of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in the skeleton of rats is not clinically 
relevant. Animal distribution studies clearly pointed out at primarily renal excretion of the drug. 
Non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 and unlabelled PSMA-617 were found to be metabolically stable in 
human, rat and minipig plasma and in liver and kidney S9 fractions of the same species. Lauric acid 
chosen by the Applicant as a positive control in metabolic assays in kidney S9 fractions shows the 
highest turnover (lauric acid hydroxylation) compared to other substrates such as NADPH cytochrome c 
reductase or glucuronidation of 4-methylumbelliferone. Compound loss measured in the positive 
controls in study 0591 were within or above the rate specified in the product specification. Therefore, 
the choice of the positive control is considered justified. 
The Applicant could not explain the observed loss of PSMA-617. However, no depletion of the cold 
[175Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 was noted. It is agreed that [175Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 is a more suitable surrogate of 
[177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. Moreover, in humans [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 turned out to be metabolically stable 
both in systemic circulation and the kidneys.  
A 175Lu-PSMA-617 test solution (a mixture of 175Lu-labeled PSMA-617 and unlabelled PSMA-617) is not 
a reversible or time-dependent inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4. It did not 
induce CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 metabolic activity to a clinically relevant extent.  
The induction potential was evaluated on activity level, and not primarily on mRNA level as suggested 
by the EMA guideline on the investigation of drug interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**).  
As PSMA-617 is not a CYP inhibitor, this is acceptable. However, one batch of hepatocytes from 
different donors, i.e. a mixture of hepatocytes from different donors, was used, although the guideline 
specifies that the induction results should be evaluated separately for each donor. To justify this 
deviation of the study protocol the applicant argues that, despite using a mixture of hepatocytes from 
different donors, the results of the positive controls indicate that assay sensitivity and performance 
were sufficient. Therefore, the assay should be able to characterize the induction potential towards CYP 
enzymes. It is noted that the guideline indicates induction results should be evaluated separately for 
each donor, because the response can vary between donors as can the cell adhesion and viability. In 
addition, the dose response can vary. Mixing results in a less constant situation per test situation, 
which may probably explain the high variability observed in the induction study. Nevertheless, 
although we consider the mixing of donors not an ideal test set up, it is agreed that the response of 
the positive controls is sufficiently high in this situation to accept it.  
In vitro drug interaction studies with transporters showed that 175Lu-PSMA-617 solution is not an 
inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MATE1, MATE2-K, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. 
175Lu-PSMA-617 solution was found to be not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MATE2-K, OCT2, 
OAT1, and OAT3. It was not investigated whether 175Lu-PSMA-617 solution is a substrate of OATP1B 
and OATP1B3, but this is acceptable given primarily renal elimination of the drug. 
Toxicology 
Rats and minipigs were shown to exhibit little toxicity when dosed with the unlabelled solution 
containing 175Lu-PSMA-617 and PSMA-617 in an approximately 1:1 ratio in single dose toxicity studies. 
This solution formulation corresponds to the therapeutic agent to be used in humans. These studies 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 28/122 
 
  
 
 
provided an ample safety margin of about 150 and 400 in rats and minipigs, respectively. Within the 
rat study only one female animal of the high dose group revealed macroscopic and microscopic 
changes of the right kidney (single, pale area with unilateral M-nephroblastoma). This might be a 
spontaneous or incidental change but in view of the fact that the kidneys are a primary site of PSMA 
uptake and that 177Lu-PSMA-617 is rapidly excreted through the kidneys, nephrotoxicity might be a 
serious adverse event in the clinical setting and should thus be carefully monitored. Prominent 
reactions within the minipig study were acute inflammation on the injection site with haemorrhage, 
crust, necrosis and thrombosis, mainly in the high dose groups. 
The estimated exposure multiples of the single-dose toxicity studies (150 and 400 in rats and minipigs, 
respectively) and the repeat-dose toxicity study were based on the potential maximum human dose of 
275 µg whereas the maximum theoretical concentration value (Cmax) in the in vitro secondary 
pharmacology study (Study 100053460-4) was calculated after a bolus injection of 200 µg. The 275 μg 
mass dose provided the most conservative estimate and resulted in a calculated safety margin of 132-
fold. However, due to the different values used in both studies, the safety margin was recalculated 
using the 200 µg dose. This value resulted in a 94-fold safety margin which is considered sufficient.  
Whereas the single dose toxicity studies were performed with the unlabelled solution, only PSMA-617 
was used as a test item in the repeated dose toxicity study in rats. The rats were shown to exhibit little 
toxicity when dosed with the unlabelled chemical precursor PSMA-617. However, these data can only 
be regarded as supportive since PSMA-617 did not mimic the intended human formulation, no TK 
analysis was made and no recovery period was included in this study. This is considered acceptable 
since no comparative values were raised in the clinical setting and no toxicities could be developed 
during the single dose toxicity study in rats. Further, the absence of the pharmacological activity of the 
non-radioactive part makes the occurrence of delayed toxicity unlikely. This view is in line with the 
guideline on radiopharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018) and thus agreed. 
Unlabelled PSMA-617 was not mutagenic as it did not induce mutations in any of the five histidine-
requiring strains of Salmonella typhimurium under the performed study conditions. 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with 177Lu-PSMA-617 or the PSMA-617 precursor as 
they are not required for an anticancer radioactive agent. 
Studies on reproductive and developmental toxicity have not been performed with 177Lu-PSMA-617, 
the unlabelled precursor molecule PSMA-617, or non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 and are not required 
for an anticancer radioactive agent. 
Considering the maximum radiation absorbed dose to the testes of 6.22 Gy 177Lu-PSMA-617 has the 
potential to cause infertility in male patients. Respective statements concerning possible effects of 
177Lu-PSMA-617 on fertility and cautionary measures for man planning to father a child are included in 
the SmPC and PL as requested. 
Conclusions on ERA 
Lutetium PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, Lutetium is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
177Lu vipivotide tetraxetan is PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy developed to treat metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer. Its primary and secondary pharmacology has been well 
characterised in vitro and in vivo. The pharmacokinetic and toxicology program is also considered 
acceptable. No toxicological effects were observed in the safety pharmacology or single dose toxicity

studies in rats and minipigs administered a non-radioactive formulation containing unlabelled vipivotide 
tetraxetan and lutetium (175Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan, or in repeat dose toxicity studies in rats 
administered unlabelled vipivotide tetraxetan. There are no objections to approval from a non-clinical 
point of view.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Within this Phase 3 study a dosimetry, pharmacokinetics and electrocardiogram sub-study also has 
been conducted in a subset of 30 patients during cycle 1 of the treatment. The patients continued in 
the sub-study as per the PSMA-617-01 protocol i.e. 177Lu-PSMA-617 7.4 GBq dose every 6 (±1) weeks 
for a maximum of 6 cycles. Together with published literature, this supports the clinical pharmacology 
assessments of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with prostate cancer. 
Because there were only 30 patients with pharmacokinetic data and also only 1 dose studied, no 
exposure-efficacy analysis were conducted and the exposure-safety analyses are for this reason 
considered only exploratory. 
Methods 
The high performance liquid chromatography with in-line radiodetection method to determine the 
possible presence of metabolites as a percentage of total radioactivity in each urine sample was not 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 31/122 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
validated in line with the recommendations in the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**). 
To evaluate whole body and organ radiation dosimetry of 177Lu-PSMA-617, patients underwent full 
body (planar) and 3D SPECT/CT imaging during Cycle 1 of treatment. Baseline images were used to 
determine volumes in regions of interest (ROI/VOI) in selected major source organs such as the liver, 
spleen and kidneys. 3D SPECT/CT scans were also performed in the upper abdomen (comprising 
kidneys, liver and spleen). Kinetic data were modeled to determine normalized number of 
disintegrations. Normalized number of disintegrations were used with the RADAR/Medical Internal 
Radiation Dose (MIRD) method for internal dosimetry as implemented in the FDA cleared OLINDA 
(Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment) software to produce radiation exposure estimates. The human 
alimentary model, and urinary voiding bladder model (with a voiding interval of 3.5 h) as implemented 
in OLINDA were utilized. 
Absorption  
As 177Lu-PSMA-617 is administered intravenously, bioavailability is 100%. No studies of bioavailability 
or effect of food were performed. No food effect is expected.  
Bioequivalence 
The proposed commercial formulation has small quantitative differences in excipients compared to the 
formulation used in Phase III clinical trial Study PSMA-617-01 which are considered minor and do not 
concern excipients that might influence the disposition of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in vivo. Therefore, a 
comparative bioavailability study as per Bioequivalence guideline (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ 
Corr **, EMA 2010) is not required. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding as determined by ultrafiltration of unlabelled PSMA-617 and non-radioactive 
175Lu-PSMA-617 at 1 and 5 µM was 58-70% and 62%-70%, respectively (study [0597]). Non-
radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 and unlabelled PSMA-617 were both stable in for up to 2 hours at 37°C 
[Study 0594]. Hence, transchelation of lutetium from 175Lu-PSMA-617 to plasma proteins has not 
been observed. 
The mean blood-to-plasma ratios for unlabelled PSMA-617 and non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 were 
0.28 and 0.49, respectively (study [Q20_046]). 
177Lu-PSMA-617 was widely distributed to tissues and volume of distribution (Vz) was 123 L (78.1%). 
The experimental data on biodistribution of 177Lu-PSMA-617 were collected up to 156-168 h post 
injection, i.e. up to approximately one physical half-life of 177Lu. This is comparable or higher than the 
measurement times used in other published studies with 177Lu-PSMA-617. From the TACs shown in the 
Dosimetry report, it seems like at the last measurement time-point (ca. 160 hours post-injection) only 
a small amount of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was still present in the body, hence the used measurement time is 
acceptable. 
The source regions analysed within the sub-study of PSMA-617-01 are consistent with those 
considered in other published works on biodistribution and dosimetry of 177Lu-PSMA-617. 
Dosimetry 
Tissue distribution was evaluated by dosimetry in 30 subjects with prostate cancer. The dosimetry of 
the sub-study PSMA-617-01 was done after one therapy cycle and extrapolated to other cycles (up to 
total administered activity of 44.4 GBq) assuming the same biokinetics. The absorbed organ doses 
were computed in the frame of the sub-study PSMA-617-01 using the software OLINDA/EXM version 
EMA/871459/2022

2.2, based on TIACs in the source regions brain, heart wall, kidneys, lacrimal glands, liver, lungs, red 
marrow, salivary glands, spleen, thyroid and whole body. The TIACs in urinary bladder contents were 
not explicitly computed from the images. The applicant utilised the urinary bladder voiding model of 
the software OLINDA/EXM instead, assuming voiding intervals of 3.5 hours. For lacrimal glands 
dosimetry a sphere model of OLINDA/EXM was used, which computes a self-absorption dose only, 
assuming an organ mass of 0.7 g. On average, the organs receiving the largest absorbed doses were 
the lacrimal glands, salivary glands, colon/rectum, and kidneys. In patients with mild and moderate 
renal impairment the absorbed doses for kidneys was on average 1.7-fold higher compared to patients 
with normal renal function. Decrease in dosimetry was relatively slow from large intestine, kidneys, 
and salivary glands compared to the decrease in other tissues. Absorbed dose coefficients estimated by 
the applicant for lacrimal and salivary glands, kidneys, liver spleen and bone marrow are in line with 
the corresponding values reported in the literature (see below tables).

Metabolism 
Non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 and unlabelled PSMA-617 were both stable in for up to 2 hours at 
37°C [Study 0594]. Additionally, non-radioactive 175Lu-PSMA-617 and unlabelled PSMA-617 were 
found to be metabolically stable against enzymatic degradation by liver and kidney human, rat, and 
minipig S9 fractions up to 1 hour at 37°C with enzyme cofactors [Study 0590] [Study 0591].  
In vivo stability of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was evaluated in urine samples of the 30 patients in the sub-study. 
Parent 177Lu-PSMA-617 was the main compound detected in all samples: the relative concentration in 
the 0 to 2 hours urine collection ranged from 91% to 100% of the radioactivity and by 72 hours post-
dose between 49% and 100% of the total radioactivity. Note that the total radioactivity at 72h post-
dose was considerably lower than radioactivity during the first 24h. However, because the urine 
collections were not cumulative, no assessment of absolute [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 concentration or 
recovery was performed. 
Overall, these data indicate that 177Lu-PSMA-617 is only metabolised to a minor extent. 
Elimination 
The applicant as well as other authors (Kratochwil et al. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.115.171397; Kabasakal 
et al. doi: 10.4274/mirt.08760) concluded that 177Lu-PSMA-617 is excreted predominantly via kidney-
urinary pathway. As reported by Kabasakal et al., more than half of the administered activity was 
eliminated through kidneys. Kratochwil et al. stated that approximately 50% of the administered 
activity was excreted by urine during the first 48 hours and that approximately 1-5% of the injected 
177Lu-PSMA-617 activity was eliminated by fecal excretion (it is not clear though for which time-period 
the gastro-intestinal excretion was reported). 
In the sub-Study PSMA-617-01 the presence of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 was confirmed in all samples 
containing radioactivity. The most common metabolites were M1, M3, and M4, however no metabolite 
was excreted in urine in a significant amount up to 48 hours. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In Study PSMA-617-01, a dose of 7.4 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-617 administered once every 6 weeks for a 
maximum of 6 cycles has been used, for a cumulative dose of 44.4 GBq. 
A dose of 7.4 GBq is proposed for all subjects. However, dose reduction by 20% for ADRs are 
recommended in case of dry mouth Grade ≥3, renal toxicity or GI toxicity Grade ≥3). 
PopPK Modelling 
A popPK model was developed to characterise the radioactivity-blood PK of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in a 
substudy of N=30 patients. Predicted exposure metrics were further used to investigate the correlation 
between exposure, dosimetry and toxicity. 
The final model was a three-compartment model with a delayed 0-order absorption and linear 
elimination; parameter estimates from the final PopPK model are listed in the following table.

Page 36/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 4: Parameter estimates from the final PopPK model 
High unexplained variability was observed for Tlag (CV = 291%, RSE = 48 %, shrinkage 44%) and 
TK0 (CV = 264%, RSE = 54%, shrinkage 50%), which are used to describe an artificial delayed 
absorption after the start of administration. Apparent difficulties occurred to describe the absorption 
phase properly due to very high variability and low number of subjects. The broad range of infusion 
times (2 minutes to 1 hour 45 min) might be problematic for data analysis, even though no clear 
relationship between infusion duration and plasma concentration could be found. It was not evaluated 
whether different qualities of the used drug influenced radioactivity-drug PK.  
In general, GOF plots demonstrated a reasonable agreement between data and model predictions. The 
residuals (IWRES and NPDE) were distributed symmetrical around the zero line. Early samples tended 
to have higher variability. pcVPCs showed an adequate predictive ability of the final popPK model 
during elimination phase (Figure 4).

Weight, BMI, age and baseline CrCL were investigated as covariates. Baseline CrCL had a significant 
impact on CL and weight had a significant impact on V1. No requirements for dose adjustments were 
derived by the Applicant from these results. In popPK modelling baseline CrCL was found as a 
significant covariate on CL as described under 2.1.2. 
Based on simulations using the popPK model, renal impairment resulted in 20% increased AUCinf for 
mild renal impairment and 42% increased AUCinf for moderate renal impairment. The underlying 
population (N=30) included only 1 patient with moderate renal impairment and 10 patients with mild 
renal impairment, no patients with severe renal impairment were included. Renal impairment showed a 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 38/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
non-significant trend toward higher kidney dosimetry values and higher injected activity and higher 
kidney dosimetry tend to be associated with larger decrease from baseline CrCL. Adjusted dosing for 
patients with renal impairment was not proposed, instead a new PBPK model was used to predict 
exposure in patients with renal impairment. Kidney dose at cycle 6 was increased more than twofold in 
patients with moderate renal impairment and 1,7-fold in patient with mild renal impairment according 
to the VISON study and the proposed PBPK model. 
Estimated AUCinf and Cmax were further used for E-R analyses, more specifically for exposure-
dosimetry and exposure-dosimetry-toxicity analyses. 
The exposure-dosimetry analysis was limited by the small sample size (N=29). For Cycle 1 no 
consistent trend was shown between injected activity and AUCinf or Cmax. The AUCinf effect on kidney 
dosimetry, might be confounded by CrCLBL, as it has both an effect on AUCinf and on kidney 
dosimetry. 
Exposure/Dosimetry-Toxicity analyses are limited by small sample size, the small number of adverse 
events and the fact that only data from treatment cycle 1 was used for the analysis. Descriptive plots 
showed a decrease in leukocytes, neutrophils and platelets after treatment administration. No 
statement regarding the risk of cumulative doses can be drawn from this analysis. 
Special populations 
The applicant has not conducted a dedicated renal impairment study for 177Lu-PSMA-617. A correlation 
between a mild to moderate renal impairment in patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 and the 
corresponded absorbed doses to kidneys was analysed though. 
PopPK modelling baseline CrCL was found as a significant covariate on CL. Based on simulations, renal 
impairment resulted in 20% increased AUCinf in mildly renally impaired patients and 42 % increased 
AUCinf in moderately renally impaired patients. The underlying population (N=30) included only 1 
patient with moderate renal impairment and 10 patients with mild renal impairment, no patients with 
severe renal impairment were included. 
In addition to that, renal impairment showed a non-significant trend toward higher kidney dosimetry 
values and higher injected activity and higher kidney dosimetry tend to be associated with larger 
decrease from baseline CrCL.  
No dedicated study in patients with liver impairment has been conducted. As 177Lu-PSMA-617 is not 
metabolized by, or primarily eliminated through, the liver, PK and biodistribution are not affected by 
hepatic impairment. Hence, the applicant proposed no dose adjustment in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
Age, in the range of 52 to 80 years (median 67 years) in the PSMA-617-01 sub-study, was not found 
as a statistically significant covariate in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 population PK model and therefore, the 
applicant recommends no dose adjustment in patients aged 65 years or older in the proposed product 
information.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The results from in vitro CYP450 induction and inhibition studies indicate that 177Lu-PSMA-617 is 
neither an inducer nor an inhibitor of the investigated CYP450 enzymes and at the investigated range 
of concentrations, respectively. 
177Lu-PSMA-617 is metabolically stable both in in vitro and in vivo and is assumed to be passively 
cleared renally, however PSMA-11 rather than 175Lu-PSMA-617 was used in the in vitro studies with 
uptake or efflux transporters (i.e. MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, P-gp and BCRP). 
Androgen deprivation therapy and other therapies targeting the androgen pathway, such as androgen 
receptor antagonists, have been reported to modulate PSMA expression in some nonclinical prostate 
cancer models, and in some clinical studies (Afshar-Oromieh et al 2018, Emmett et al 2019, Vaz et al 
2020, Mathy et al 2021) and might in this way affect the efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617. Only patients 
with confirmed PSMA expression were included in the study and subgroup analysis were conducted for 
comedication with androgen axis drugs which did not indicate that co-administration of androgen axis 
drugs had a detrimental effect. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
177Lu-PSMA-617 is a PSMA-targeted radioligand therapeutic that delivers radiation to cancer cells via 
binding to the PSMA cell-surface target. Specifically, this agent has been designed to bind with high 
affinity to PSMA expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells in order to target therapeutic 
radiation to sites of disease. The targeting and binding of the agent to PSMA occurs through the 
glutamate-urea-lysine pharmacophore portion of the molecule. In vitro experiments showed PSMA 
binding affinity to be high with nanomolar affinity reported in cellular assays. PSMA-dependent uptake 
and internalization of 177Lu-PSMA-617, were also confirmed in cellular assays that lead to prolonged 
retention in the targeted cancer cell. The resulting radiation exposure causes DNA damage in these 
targeted cancer cells, as well as in neighbouring cells due to bystander and cross-fire effects, from the 
release of medium-energy β-particles emitted from Lu-177. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No dedicated PD studies have been submitted. No relevant pharmacodynamic effects related to the 
ligand itself are expected, as the total peptide mass of PSMA-617 ligand that is injected is low (with a 
potential maximum of 275 µg of total peptide), it is administered infrequently (every 6 weeks), and 
nonclinical studies demonstrated a lack of direct pharmacological and toxicological effects across in 
vitro and in vivo assays at much higher exposures (see Non-clinical section).

Individual predicted AUCinf and Cmax derived from PopPK modelling were plotted against injected 
dose and did not show any clear trend of correlation, as illustrated in below figure. 
Figure 5: Predicted AUCinf and Cmax vs. injected dose 
Effect of exposure on dosimetry in critical organs (i.e. kidney, bone marrow, salivary glands and 
lacrimal glands) during the first cycle of treatment in mCRPC patients were explored. Dosimetry 
assessments for each organ of interest were available in 29 patients from the PSMA-617-01 sub-study. 
Table below summarizes the dosimetry values (in Gy) calculated on Cycle 1 per organs. The highest 
dosimetry values were observed in lacrimal glands. Lower dosimetry values were observed in salivary, 
kidney, and bone. One patient had a very high bone marrow dosimetry compared to the others.  
Table 6: Summary of dosimetry values (Gy) per organs on Cycle 1 
The relationship between exposure and dosimetry from organs at risk at Cycle 1 were explored. The 
strongest correlation was observed between blood AUCinf and kidney dosimetry (R=0.51). The Pearson 
correlation coefficients also suggested some degrees of correlation between blood AUCinf and 
dosimetry in bone marrow (R=0.36) and in lacrimal glands (R=0.28), between Cmax and kidney 
dosimetry (R=0.31), as well as between injected activity and dosimetry in bone marrow (R=0.32) and 
in kidney (R=0.3). Linear regression was performed for each exposure-dosimetry relationship, and 
results show that AUCinf in blood is a statistically significant predictor of kidney dosimetry (p=0.005). 
Results from the linear regression between AUCinf and kidney dosimetry are reported in below table. 
This analysis suggests that an increase in AUCinf by 1000 MBq.h/L would lead to an increase in kidney 
dosimetry by 0.7 Gy.

Table 7: Results from the linear regressions between AUCinf and kidney dosimetry 
Exposure/dosimetry-toxicity analyses 
Relationships between exposure/dosimetry and acute toxicity related to kidney, bone marrow, salivary 
and lacrimal glands during the first cycle of treatment with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in mCRPC patients 
were explored. Due to the limited number of patients (N=30) and adverse events, only descriptive 
plots were generated. 
CrCL, as a surrogate of renal function, and renal adverse events were explored to evaluate the risk 
related to kidneys. Hemoglobin, leukocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts together with their 
associated adverse events (i.e. anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) were explored 
as indicators for hematological toxicity. 
In the PK/Dosimetry-Toxicity datasets, occurrence of toxicity and their associated grades were 
considered as categorical variables and laboratory values as continuous variables. All the exposure 
metrics were considered as continuous variables. 
Longitudinal laboratory data during Cycle 1 were first explored from a total of 30 patients, the majority 
of the individuals had one baseline and 5 post-baseline observations available. Only few individuals 
reached the threshold for hematological adverse event of CTCAE Grade ≥ 2 related to hemoglobin, 
leukocytes, neutrophils or platelets. Those patients were the ones with low baseline levels for the 
associated laboratory values. 
First, exposure/dosimetry-toxicity analyses explored the worst decrease from baseline in CrCL, 
reflecting renal function, and the worst decrease from baseline in platelet count, the most radiation-
sensitive hematological laboratory assessment. Among the sub-study patients with post-baseline 
assessments, 17 (59%) showed a decrease from baseline in CrCL and 25 (86%) experienced a 
decrease in platelet count during Cycle 1. 
The worst individual CrCL decrease (% change from baseline) at Cycle 1 was plotted against each 
exposure metrics for each one of the 17 patients who had a decrease in CrCL from baseline. Higher 
injected activity and higher kidney dosimetry tend to be associated with larger decrease in CrCL 
change from baseline. The positive trend between worst CrCL decrease and exposure in blood (AUCinf 
and Cmax) may be due to the limited sample size, the variability in the data and the presence of 
outliers. 
No clear and consistent trend could be detected between worst platelet count decrease or 
haematological toxicity grades/adverse events and exposure.  
Also, for patients experiencing at least one salivary gland toxicity (any grade), no consistent trend 
across the four exposure metrics was observed. 
PK/QT analysis 
For clinical cardiodynamic evaluation compliant with ICH E14, ECGs and time-matched PK were 
collected in the sub-study for PSMA-617-01. ECGs and PK samples were collected prior to 
administration and at 1, 4, and 24 hours post-dose. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 42/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
177Lu-PSMA-617 on the QTc interval using the Fridericia method (QTcF) using a by-timepoint analysis 
as the primary analysis and concentration-QTc effect analysis as a secondary analysis.  
In the by-timepoint analysis (N=30), 177Lu-PSMA-617 had no clinically relevant effect on QTcF, with 
the QTcF change-from-baseline ranging from -5.2 ms to 2.1 ms. The concentration-QTc analysis was 
confirmatory, with a model predicted QT change from baseline (∆QTcF) of 3.1 ms (2-sided 90% upper 
confidence bound 5.5 ms) at geometric mean Cmax 3.8 ng/mL. Based on the concentration-QTc 
analysis, an effect on ∆QTcF exceeding 20 ms can be excluded within the full observed range of ¹⁷⁷Lu-
PSMA-617 plasma concentrations and up to ~6 ng/mL. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A sub-study within pivotal Phase 3 study PSMA-617-01 evaluated dosimetry in 29 patients, and PK and 
ECG in 30 patients from a non-randomized cohort receiving 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC. The 
supportive pharmacokinetic and biodistribution/dosimetry information collected from the available 
literature provides a background information for this application. 
Methods 
The high-performance liquid chromatography with in-line radiodetection method to determine the 
possible presence of metabolites as a percentage of total radioactivity in each sample was not 
validated in line with the recommendations in the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**). Since the purpose was exploratory and a relative 
quantitation rather than an absolute quantitation of concentration of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and 
metabolites was the objective, the method is considered fit for that purpose.   
Distribution 
Tissue dosimetry distribution was in general similar for 177Lu-PSMA-617 and Ga-PSMA-11 except for 
dosimetry in large intestine, which appears higher for 177Lu-PSMA-617 compared to Ga-PSMA-11. Since 
the PSMA-targeting pharmacophore glutamate-urea-lysine is the same in both substances a similar 
tissue distribution is expected. The applicant discussed that the apparent difference in tissue dosimetry 
between 177Lu-PSMA-617 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 could be due to the difference in effective half-lifes of 
177Lu and 68Ga, 33h vs 54 min, respectively. Indeed effective half-life of 68Ga is so short that no 
activity could be detected by the time that 68Ga-PSMA-11 could have reached the large intestine if part 
of the dose would be excreted in the faeces. 
Dosimetry 
The proposed treatment regime (7.4 GBq pro cycle administered every 6 weeks (± 1 week) over a 
maximum of 6 cycles) was selected with the purpose of delivering the highest possible dose to the 
tumour and simultaneously without causing serious toxicity in the patient. The absorbed doses in 
organs at risk need to be carefully considered while prescribing treatment regimens to individual 
patients. 
The applicant provided additional data comprising of the results of the dosimetric calculations 
conducted in the frame of an ongoing clinical study with 177Lu-PSMA-617. Overall, the comparison of 
the cumulative absorbed doses in organs at risk computed (partly) based on the data from the 
individual therapy cycles and extrapolated from the data in cycle 1 showed that, at least in the 
considered patient population, the extrapolation method overestimated the cumulative absorbed doses 
in all organs at risk except the salivary glands. This is not expected to be a major issue from the safety 
point of view, since it gives a conservative estimation of the absorbed organ doses. Nonetheless, it is 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 43/122 
 
 
  
 
 
not ideal for the treatment optimisation based on the maximum tolerable absorbed dose in non-target 
organs or tissues, as less activity will be administered than actually tolerable. 
The urinary bladder voiding model of the software OLINDA/EXM with voiding intervals of 3.5 hours was 
employed by the applicant for dosimetry. It is not clear which assumptions regarding the voiding 
fractions and the biological half-lives were made. The source region “generalised GI” showed the 
highest uptake of 177Lu-PSMA-617, however TIACs for this region are not given. It is stated in the 
dosimetry report that human alimentary tract model as implemented in OLINDA/EXM was utilised. 
Here it was not clear either which specific assumptions were made. The applicant recapitulated 
literature findings regarding the excretion of 177Lu-PSMA-617. Only one study by Kratochwil et al. 
reported quantitative data on the elimination of 177Lu-PSMA-617 by faecal excretion (1-5 %). From this 
study it is not clear though for which time-period the abovementioned gastro-intestinal excretion was 
evaluated. The applicant also suggested that the relatively low absorbed dose to liver was an indication 
of only a minor excretion of 177Lu-PSMA-617 via liver. The applicant further argued that a higher 
absorbed dose would be expected, were the excretion via liver more considerable. This argument is not 
appropriate though, since an uptake in a specific organ affects the corresponding absorbed dose and 
not the other way around. 
Even though only limited quantitative data assessing the excretion of 177Lu-PSMA-617 via alimentary 
tract are available, it seems to be consistent among several studies that the alimentary tract plays only 
a minor role in the elimination of 177Lu-PSMA-617. The applicant concluded that ≥ 80% of 177Lu-PSMA-
617 is excreted via the kidney-urinary pathway. It is agreed that excretion in urine in the major 
elimination pathway, but urinary excretion was <80% after 2 days and excretion in the faeces of 1-5% 
seems only be based on data within 2 days after administration, which is too short to conclude absence 
of excretion in the faeces. Further, diarrhoea occurred more often for 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm 
vs. BSC/BSoC only arm. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that a somewhat greater part than 1-5% of 
the administered 177Lu-PSMA-617 is excreted in the faeces and that the apparent difference in tissue 
dosimetry between 177Lu-PSMA-617 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 is partly due to differences in effective half-life 
of 177Lu and 68Ga and resulting different local exposure-time profiles of these moieties in the large 
intestine.   
The applicant highlighted possible uncertainties in the computed doses for such small organs as 
lacrimal glands, due to substantial uncertainties of the planar based image quantification for these 
regions. 
Absorbed dose coefficients estimated by the applicant for lacrimal and salivary glands, kidneys, liver 
spleen and bone marrow are in line with the corresponding values reported in the literature. 
Based on the analyses done by the applicant to investigate the correlation between the kidney function 
of patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 and the absorbed dose to kidneys, it seems that mild to 
moderate renal impairment affects the absorbed dose to kidneys. The clinical relevance of this finding 
is difficult to interpret as there is no clear relationship established between kidney dosimetry and 
clinical safety. The computed absorbed dose to kidneys for a patient with a moderate renal impairment 
lied within the distribution observed for patients with mild renal impairment. The applicant concluded 
that mild and moderate renal impairment are unlikely to warrant any adjustments in administered 
activities, since no clinically significant renal toxicity was observed in the study PSMA-617-01 in spite 
of higher doses to the kidneys. However, no information is available for severe renal impairment or 
end-stage renal disease, for which kidney doses are expected to be even higher. Therefore, the 
treatment with Pluvicto is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment with 
baseline CLcr <50 mL/min or end stage renal disease. This has been reflected in the PI. 
Excretion 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 44/122 
 
 
  
 
 
177Lu-PSMA-617 is likely to be eliminated mainly by excretion in the urine. Because of the high 
dosimetry in the large intestine excretion in the faces cannot be excluded. Determination of the 
presence of metabolites in urine samples indicated that 177Lu-PSMA-617 was the main component 
present in urine indeed indicating importance of the renal excretion of 177Lu-PSMA-617. Excretion, 
however, has not been quantified because no cumulative urine had been collected. Based on 
radioactivity remaining in the body a rough indication for the excretion can be obtained: after 2h, 22h, 
45h, and 165h, 86%, 29%, 19%, and 7.5%, respectively, remained in the body. Hence, approximately 
70% of the radioactivity was excreted within the first day followed by a slower elimination. Based on 
the high excretion during the first day, 177Lu-PSMA-617 is probably mainly excreted in the urine.  
A simple first order kinetics model was developed to describe the injected activity (IA) for kidney in the 
first cycle. The effect of renal function on the elimination, kidney dosimetry half-life and excretion half-
life (hour) of the IA was approximately 40% and 25%, respectively, with increased half-lives  in 
subjects with mild renal impairment. Renal function and adverse reactions should be frequently 
monitored in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment because of increased chance of AEs (see 
section 4.4). The text in section 5.2 special populations – renal impairment is aligned with the text in 
section 4.4.   
Further, it is assumed that 177Lu-PSMA-617 is excreted in urine via glomular filtration and that no 
active excretion is involved. The reabsorption of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 is unlikely because plasma 
clearance is in the range of a passive renal clearance.  Further, amino acid infusion, which could reduce 
re-uptake in the kidneys, had no effect on the clearance of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, also indicating no or 
limited reabsorption in the tubuli.  
popPK 
A popPK model was developed to characterise the radioactivity-blood PK of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in a 
substudy of N=30 patients. Predicted exposure metrics were used to investigate the correlation 
between exposure, dosimetry and toxicity. 
Estimated AUCinf was further used for E-R analyses, more specifically for exposure-dosimetry and 
exposure-dosimetry-toxicity analyses. 
The final popPK model was a three-compartment model with a delayed 0-order absorption and linear 
elimination. High unexplained variability was observed for Tlag (CV = 291%, RSE = 48 %, shrinkage 
44%) and TK0 (CV = 264%, RSE = 54%, shrinkage 50%), which are used to describe an artificial 
delayed absorption after the start of administration. Apparent difficulties occurred to describe the 
absorption phase properly due to very high variability and low number of subjects. The broad range of 
infusion times (2 minutes to 1 hour 45 min) might be problematic for data analysis, even though no 
clear relationship between infusion duration and plasma concentration could be found. It was not 
evaluated whether different qualities of the used drug influenced results for radioactivity-drug PK.  
As covariates were investigated weight, BMI, age and baseline CrCL. Baseline CrCL had a significant 
impact on CL and weight had a significant impact on V1. No requirements for dose adjustments were 
derived from these results. 
The small sample size of N=30 patients sampled only in cycle 1 is regarded as limited data for 
population PK analysis. It is strongly recommended to update the popPK model with more PK data 
when possible, especially to provide more insight on the high variability. In addition, exposure-toxicity 
analyses could gain from data later treatment cycles, because more adverse events might occur in 
later treatment cycles. 
In general, GOF plots demonstrated a reasonable agreement between data and model predictions. The 
residuals (IWRES and NPDE) were distributed symmetrical around the zero line. Early samples tended

to have higher variability. pcVPCs showed an adequate predictive ability of the final popPK model 
during elimination phase. 
The applicant reported an effective half-time of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in blood of ~ 33 hours in 29 patients. 
and  clarified that the effective half-life of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was not calculated individually for each 
patient, rather the geometric mean of the terminal elimination half-life was computed from the values 
assessed individually for 29 patients and utilised for the subsequent calculation of the effective half-life 
of 177Lu-PSMA-617. 
The applicant was recommended to update the popPK model with more PK data when possible, 
especially to provide more insight on the high variability. In addition, exposure-toxicity analyses could 
benefit from data on later treatment cycles, because more adverse events might occur in later 
treatment cycles. 
Renal impairment 
The applicant has not conducted a dedicated renal impairment study for 177Lu-PSMA-617. 
In popPK modelling baseline CrCL was found as a significant covariate on CL. Based on simulations, 
renal impairment resulted in 20% increased AUCinf in mildly renally impaired patients and 42 % 
increased AUCinf in moderately renally impaired patients. The underlying population (N=30) included 
only 1 patient with moderate renal impairment and 10 patients with mild renal impairment, no patients 
with severe renal impairment were included. Since there was only 1 subject with moderate renal 
impairment i.e. CrCL 54 ml/min in the pharmacology sub-study, these data should be interpreted 
cautiously. In addition, kidney dosimetry was on average 1.7-fold higher in subjects with mild renal 
impairment. 
Further, renal impairment showed a non-significant trend toward higher kidney dosimetry values and 
higher injected activity and higher kidney dosimetry tend to be associated with larger decrease from 
baseline CrCL.  
It is unlikely though that accumulation occurs with repeated dosing in patients with renal impairment 
given the estimated effective elimination half-life of 33h accounting for the decay of Lu-177 
radioactivity in subjects with normal renal function and the dosing interval of 6 weeks; however, 
patients with renal impairment had more AEs (see safety) likely due to the higher prolonged exposure. 
In study PSMA-617-01, renal function CrCL >50 ml/min was an inclusion criterion. Further, in the 
SmPC (Table 1 section 4.2) it is recommended to withhold treatment in patients with CrCL<30 ml/min. 
Therefore, treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 cannot be recommended in patients with moderate and 
severe renal impairment with CrCL <50 ml/min. SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4  
The Applicant proposed revisions to the dedicated sections of the SmPC concerning patients with renal 
impairment. Following these amendments, the treatment with Pluvicto is currently not recommended 
in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment with baseline CLcr <50 mL/min or end stage 
renal disease. The Post Marketing Requirement from FDA, the Renal Impairment Study 
CAAA617A12202 (CSR expected to be available in Q4 2026) is set to determine the kidney 
biodistribution, dosimetry, pharmacokinetics, and safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 and assess the potential 
for higher drug exposure and the resultant risk of increased serious toxicities in patients with moderate 
and severe renal impairment. It is expected that the study will provide additional information in this 
patient population with subsequent optimisation the labelling recommendations. 
To improve the elimination the renal toxicity W&P within section 4.4 of the proposed EU SmPC advises 
on encouraged hydration/increasing of oral fluids and frequent voiding/urination.   
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 46/122 
 
 
  
 
 
Since 177Lu-PSMA-617 is eliminated in the urine, guidance for subjects with urine incontinence is 
provided  for patients and their care givers #in the PIL (see SmPC). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dedicated hepatic impairment study for 177Lu-PSMA-617 has been conducted.  
For hepatic impairment the inclusion criteria in the pivotal study were AST/ALT  < 3 ULN or  <5 ULN 
for patients with liver metastases and total bilirubin < 1.5  ULN. Further, in the SmPC it is 
recommended to discontinue treatment when AST/ALT are increased > 5 ULN. Therefore, there is very 
limited safety data in patients with hepatic impairment. It is however agreed that varying degrees of 
hepatic impairment are not likely to affect the pharmacokinetics of [177Lu]-PSMA-617 since it is not 
metabolised. Also hepatotoxicity was not remarkable in VISION. However, there is no experience with 
patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment and this is reflected in the SmPC section 4.2.  
Special populations 
Since 177Lu-PSMA-617 has been limited to investigations in prostate cancer, exclusive to males, there 
is no information regarding the impact of gender on PK or biodistribution. 177Lu-PSMA-617 is not 
indicated for use in females. 
Although currently no information is available about the effects of race or ethnicity, the effect by ethnic 
factors on PK is considered unlikely. 
Age, in the range of 52 to 80 years (median 67 years) in the PSMA-617-01 sub-study, was not found 
as a statistically significant covariate in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 population PK model. However, higher 
absorbed radiation dose levels in the kidneys and bone marrow had been observed in older patients, 
despite the possibility that this correlation may be confounded by the negative correlation between age 
and renal clearance. Data provided during the procedure showed that the AUC in patients 75-80 years 
old is 1.5-fold higher compared to patients <65 years old (Median 3963.34 vs. 2648.62 MBq.h/L). 
Further clarification may be expected from the results of the planned Renal Impairment Study (Study 
CAAA617A12202) that the applicant was recommended to provide. 
Drug drug interactions 
177Lu-PSMA-617 is metabolically stable both in in vitro and in vivo and is assumed to be passively 
cleared renally, however PSMA-11 rather than 175Lu-PSMA-617 was used in the in vitro studies with 
uptake or efflux transporters (i.e. MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, P-gp and BCRP). The in vitro 
studies were not optimally reported and conducted. 
Pharmacodynamics 
177Lu-PSMA-617 is a PSMA-targeted radioligand therapeutic that delivers radiation to cancer cells via 
binding to the PSMA cell-surface target. Specifically, this agent has been designed to bind with high 
affinity to PSMA expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells in order to target therapeutic 
radiation to sites of disease.  
The exposure-dosimetry analysis was limited by the small sample size (N=29). For Cycle 1 no 
consistent trend was shown between injected activity and AUCinf or Cmax. The AUCinf effect on kidney 
dosimetry, might be confounded by CrCLBL, as it has both an effect on AUCinf and on kidney 
dosimetry.  
Exposure/Dosimetry-Toxicity analyses are limited by the small sample size, the small number of 
adverse events and the fact that only data from treatment cycle 1 was used for the analysis. 
Descriptive plots showed a decrease in leukocytes, neutrophils and platelets after treatment 
administration. No statement regarding the risk of cumulative doses can be drawn from this analysis. 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 47/122 
 
 
  
 
 
According to the results of the PK/QT analysis together with the preclinical cardiac safety studies, there 
appears to be a negligible risk of an electrophysiological effect by 175Lu-PSMA-617. However, due to 
lack of a dedicated QT/QTC study and to the lack of systematic collection of ECGs during the pivotal 
study the risk for QT prolongation is not well characterized. Therefore, the Applicant is recommended 
to repeat the PK/QT assessment in the above-mentioned Renal Impairment Study (Study 
CAAA617A12202) performed in mCRPC patients (PAM-REC). ECGs and time-matched PK samples will 
be collected in all patients enrolled in all groups of the study (normal renal function, moderate and 
severe renal impaired patients) to enable concentration-QTc effect analysis on this data. The PK/QT 
assessment in Study CAAA617A12202 will be performed according to the Guideline CHMP/ICH/2/04. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant conducted a sub-study (within pivotal Study PSMA-617-01) to evaluate dosimetry, PK, 
ECGs, safety and tolerability, and urinary metabolic stability in a single-arm non-randomized cohort of 
30 patients. The clinical pharmacology of 177Lu-PSMA-617, well described in the literature, provides a 
background information for this application.  
Overall, all aspects of the Clinical Pharmacology were sufficiently addressed. The Applicant was 
recommended to submit the results of the planned Renal Impairment Study (Study CAAA617A12202). 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical data package is based on the results of the pivotal VISION Study (PSMA-617-01) and 
supportive RESIST-PC Study (PSMA-617-02).  
Pivotal Study PSMA-617-01 (VISION) is an international, prospective, open-label, multicenter, 
randomized Phase III study of Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan in patients with progressive 
PSMA-positive mCRPC who were previously treated with 1-2 taxane-based chemotherapy regimens 
and at least one AR pathway inhibitor and who had a gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET/CT scan that 
determined them eligible for inclusion. A sub-study was also conducted in approximately 30 patients 
treated with Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan+BSC/BSoC at sites in Germany to evaluate 
radiation dosimetry, PK, ECGs, safety and tolerability, and urinary metabolic stability. 
(Supportive Study PSMA-617-02 (RESIST-PC) evaluated two doses of Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan (6.0 GBq and 7.4 GBq) in a Phase II open-label, bicentric, randomized prospective setting. 
This study is only providing supportive safety data in this application, since only limited 
efficacy data were collected for this study following its termination.)

Results 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The applicant supported that the selection of the 177Lu-PSMA-617 7.4 GBq dose for Study PSMA-617-
01 was determined by considering prior clinical experience regarding efficacy and safety, dosimetric 
evaluation and radiosensitivity, and RLT class-based information from Lutathera. 
Dosimetry and radiation safety considerations 
At present, the absorbed radiation dose thresholds for different organ systems have not been 
completely defined for RLTs, with existing thresholds being historically based on EBRT. The radiation 
dose administered during EBRT is frequently limited by the risk of long-term toxicities to adjacent 
organs as a consequence of treatment with high dose rate radiation, and these limits for EBRT have 
been estimated and published in the literature (Emami et al 1991, Dawson et al 2010, Marks et al 
2010, Emami 2013). However, the application of these EBRT thresholds to RLT is likely too 
conservative due to the intrinsic differences between external and systemic radiotherapy treatment 
modalities and thus serves mainly as a guide for RLT dose selection, as opposed to a restrictive limit. 
At the time of Study PSMA-617-01 protocol development, 11 dosimetry studies in over 100 patients 
had been conducted and published. The results were consistent across the studies, and demonstrated 
exposure that correlated well with the expected rapid clearance of a small molecule, and the limited 
distribution pattern of a PSMA-targeted RLT. The primary sites of non-tumor uptake reported in these 
published dosimetry studies were the salivary glands, lacrimal glands, and kidneys, with excretory 
mechanisms and PSMA expression in the proximal tubules contributing to exposure in the kidneys 
(please refer to the PK part of this AR for details). 
Approximately 50% of the injected dose was shown to be excreted in the urine within the first 48 
hours. Additionally normal bone marrow, although PSMA-negative, can be exposed transiently to 177Lu-
PSMA-617 while in circulation, or through proximal exposure from the uptake in neighboring PSMA-
positive PC bone lesions, a common site of metastasis. The bone marrow also represents a 
radiosensitive tissue due to its proliferative nature; therefore, the bone marrow radiation absorbed 
dose was also a consideration. 
When determining the dose for Study PSMA-617-01, a more specific consideration of cumulative 
radiation exposure in these tissues was considered due to multi-cycle treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617.  
Class-based evidence (Lutathera) 
Lutathera was the first approved peptide-based 177Lu-radioligand therapeutic in NET-Tumours, and 
utilizes a dose of 7.4 GBq every 8 weeks for a total of 4 cycles, although other doses and schedules 
have been evaluated in the literature. The published experience with Lutathera informed much of the 
early development work that has been done with 177Lu-PSMA-617. Considering Lutathera as a 
comparator is particularly relevant, as the kidney dosimetry profile for both agents is similar, due to 
the renal clearance of both agents, as well as their target expression on the renal proximal tubules. 
 Based on the extensive clinical experience with Lutathera, the kidney absorbed radiation dose 
thresholds in RLT were suggested to be higher than the EBRT threshold for kidneys suggested by 
several authors (Wessels et al 2008, Bergsma et al 2016).  
Previous Experience with 177-Lu-PSMA 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 50/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Recent publications show that cumulative doses of 30 to 60 GBq of 177Lu-PSMA-617 may be possible 
without adverse effects on renal tissue (Kratochwil et al 2016, Kabasakal et al 2017, Scarpa et al 
2017), 45 to 73.8 GBq for hematological tissue (Kabasakal et al 2017, Scarpa et al 2017), and 50 GBq 
for salivary glands (Virgolini et al 2018).  
The majority of the publications used a regimen of 4 cycles of 6 GBq every 8 weeks. However, 
efficacy and safety information from the prospective Phase II study by Hofman et al (2018) suggested 
that dosing of 4.4 to 8.7 GBq (mean: 7.5) every 6 weeks for 4 cycles was well tolerated and efficacious 
in patients with mCRPC.  
However, there were also reports of more than 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 being administered safely 
as a means to maximize the benefit to the patient (Rahbar et al 2018); therefore, the 2 additional 
cycles (resulting in a maximum of 6 cycles) were incorporated into the Study PSMA-617-01 protocol 
under the condition that benefit and tolerability were confirmed following the 4th cycle. 
Based on these published data, and with the purpose of delivering the highest possible dose to the 
tumor to maximize the chance for an effective antitumor effect without causing serious toxicity in the 
patient, a dose of 7.4 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-617 administered intravenously once every 6 weeks for a 
maximum of 6 cycles was selected for Study PSMA-617-01, for a maximum cumulative dose of 44.4 
GBq. 
Proposed posology 
Efficacy and safety results from Study PSMA-617-01 support the proposed dose and regimen. 
Additional evidence for using a total of 6 cycles in patients is also provided by the following sub-group 
analyses from Study PSMA-617-01 in the 69 patients who received 4 cycles, and the 289 patients who 
received 5-6 cycles (FAS Safety set). The following findings support treatment with 6 cycles compared 
to 4 cycles only: 
•  Median rPFS for patients who received 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was 6.4 months (95% CI: 
4.3, 7.9); for patients who received 5-6 cycles, median rPFS was 13.8 months (95% CI: 12.2, 
17.0). 
•  Median OS for patients who received 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was 11.0 months (95% CI: 
9.6, 12.6); for patients who received 5-6 cycles, median OS was 24.7 months (95% CI: 21.3, 
27.6). 
•  Median PFS for patients who received 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was 4.4 months (95% CI: 
3.3, 4.7); for patients who received 5-6 cycles, median PFS was 9.9 months (95% CI: 8.6, 
11.3). 
•  Median time to worsening in FACT-P total score for patients who received 4 cycles of 177Lu-
PSMA-617 was 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.2, 6.0); for patients who received 5-6 cycles, median 
time to worsening in FACT-P total score was 9.2 months (95% CI: 8.3, 11.1). Median time to 
worsening in FACT-G total score for patients who received 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was 5.6 
months (95% CI: 4.6, 6.0); for patients who received 5-6 cycles, median time to worsening in 
FACT-G total score was 10.3 months (95% CI: 8.8, 11.4). 
•  Median time to worsening in BPI-SF pain intensity for patients who received 4 cycles of 177Lu-
PSMA-617 was 4.7 months (95% CI: 3.1, 5.7); for patients who received 5-6 cycles, median 
time to worsening in BPI-SF pain intensity was 9.4 months (95% CI: 8.5, 10.8). 
•  Median time to worsening in BPI-SF pain interference for patients who received 4 cycles of 
177Lu-PSMA-617 was 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.4, 6.0); for patients who received 5-6 cycles, 
median time to worsening in BPI-SF pain interference was 8.8 months (95% CI: 7.4, 10.4). 
EMA/871459/2022

•  AEs were also assessed in patients who received ≤4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 and in those who 
received 5 or 6 cycles. Overall, there was no suggestion of a safety concern in patients who 
received more cycles.

Figure 6: Study design 
Methods 
Study Participants 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: Adult male patients who had a histological, pathological, 
and/or cytological confirmation of PC, progressive mCRPC (based on any one of the following as 
defined by the prostate cancer clinical trials working group 3 (PCWG3) criteria for clinical trial entry: 
serum PSA progression, soft-tissue progression, or progression of bone disease), had received at least 
1 novel androgen axis drug (NAAD), were previously treated with at least 1 but no more than 2 prior 
taxane regimens and had a positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan, as determined by the Sponsor’s 
central reader.  
Main criteria for exclusion: Patients with previous treatment with any of the following within 6 
months of randomization: strontium-89, samarium-153, rhenium-186, rhenium-188, radium-223, or 
hemi-body irradiation or previously treated with PSMA-targeted targeted radioligand therapy (RLT), or 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 52/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
any systemic anti-cancer therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, immunotherapy or biological therapy) within 28 
days prior to day of randomization were excluded. These criteria and other safety related exclusion 
criteria would potentially increase the heterogeneity of the population and may cause bias. Thus, they 
are also acceptable. 
Treatments 
177Lu-PSMA-617 was administered as a slow i.v. injection at a dose of 7.4 GBq (±10%) once every 6 
weeks (±1 week) for a maximum of 6 cycles. It was administered only by qualified/authorized 
personnel. Treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 was performed in accordance with national and/or local 
radiation safety requirements. Due to nature of this drug product there was 1 batch number for each 
patient dose.  
BSC/BSoC was prescribed by each patient’s physician and reflected standard interventions available to 
clinicians. BSC/BSoC regimen could be adapted during the study to the best interest of the patient at 
the discretion of the Investigator, however investigational agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
immunotherapy, other systemic radio isotopes (e.g. radium-223), or hemi-body radiotherapy 
treatment were not allowed during the study.  
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of the pivotal trial PSMA-617-01 was to compare the 2 alternate endpoints of 
radiographic- progression-free survival (rPFS) and OS in patients with progressive prostate-specific 
membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive mCRPC who received 177Lu-PSMA-617 in addition to best 
supportive/best standard of care (BSC/BSoC) versus patients treated by BSC/BSoC only. 
The statistical design of the study was such that, to be declared positive, the study would be required 
to reach statistical significance on either rPFS or OS at the respective allocated alpha level. 
Key secondary objectives 
Key secondary objectives are an arm-to-arm comparison of the following: 
•  Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) response: 
o  Overall response rate (ORR) as measured by RECIST v1.1 and  
o  Disease control rate (DCR) as measured by RECIST v1.1 
• 
Time to a first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) 
Key secondary endpoints were assessed using the Hochberg closed test procedure at the alpha level 
applicable to the successful OS endpoint. This procedure is reasonable given the positive correlation 
between the key secondary endpoints. 
Additional secondary objectives 
•  Safety and tolerability of 177Lu-PSMA-617 
• 
Periodic assessment of health-related quality of life (HR QoL) to evaluate impact of intervention 
on patient well-being (EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, functional 
assessment of cancer therapy – prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire, and brief pain inventory – 
short form (BPI-SF)) 
•  Health economics

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints; 
“Alternate primary endpoints” 
• 
rPFS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date 
of radiographic disease progression based on the central review assessment per the 
PCWG3 criteria or death due to any cause. Patients who were alive without radiographic 
progression at the analysis data cut-off were censored for rPFS at the time of their last 
evaluable radiographic assessment.  
The null hypothesis for rPFS, assumed the median rPFS was 4 months on active treatment for a HR of 
1.00. Under the alternative hypothesis, median rPFS on active treatment was assumed to be 6 months 
for a HR of 0.67. 
•  OS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of 
death due to any cause. If the patient was not known to have died, then OS was 
censored. The censoring date was date of the last study visit, or contact, until the 
cut-off date. The cut-off date was not used for last contact date, unless the patient 
was seen or contacted on that date.  
The null hypothesis for survival, assumed median OS was 10 months on active treatment for a HR of 
1.00. Under the alternative hypothesis, median OS on active treatment was assumed to be 13.7 
months for a HR of 0.7306. 
Key secondary endpoints 
Key secondary objectives are an arm-to-arm comparison of the following: 
•  Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) response: 
o  Overall response rate (ORR) as measured by RECIST v1.1 
o  Disease control rate (DCR) as measured by RECIST v1.1 
•  Time to a first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE). 
Additional secondary endpoints 
•  Safety and tolerability of 177Lu-PSMA-617 
• 
Periodic assessment of health-related quality of life (HR QoL) to evaluate impact of intervention 
on patient well-being (EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, functional 
assessment of cancer therapy – prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire, and brief pain inventory – 
short form (BPI-SF)) 
•  Health economics 
• 
•  Biochemical response as measured by prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Alkaline phosphatase 
Progression-free survival (PFS) (radiographic, clinical, or PSA) 
(ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were also collected. 
Sample size 
Based on a non-linear patient accrual profile over 14 months, a total of 814 patients randomized and 
followed on an ITT basis for a minimum of 13 months was expected to yield 508 deaths. 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 54/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
This number of events provided at least 90% power to test the hypothesis that the HR for OS is 1.00 
with the alternative 0.7306 or better with a 1-sided alpha level of at least 0.020. 
For rPFS, a total of approximately 557/814 patients were expected to be randomized on or after 05-
Mar-2019, these being the patients of the primary analysis of rPFS; with a minimum of approximately 
6 months follow-up, these patients were expected to yield 364 rPFS events which was sufficient to 
provide 84% power to test the hypothesis that the HR of rPFS is 1.00 with the alternative 0.67 or 
better with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.004.  
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Patients were randomized by an IRT in a 2:1 ratio to the investigational treatment arm (177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC) or to the control arm (BSC/BSoC-only) using a permuted block scheme. 
Randomization was stratified by the following 4 factors: 
• 
• 
LDH (≤ 260 IU/L vs. > 260 IU/L) 
Presence of liver metastases (yes vs. no) 
•  ECOG score (0 or 1 vs. 2) 
• 
Inclusion of NAAD in BSC/BSoC at time of randomization (yes vs. no)  
As other trial investigating a RLT-product, blinding is not possible since normal radiation detectors used 
for safety reasons easily unblind the patient’s treatment allocation. Thus, it is agreed that the study 
was performed open label.  
Statistical methods 
The planned analyses and statistical methods are described in the final version of the statistical 
analysis plan which was written and approved prior to database lock. 
The following analysis sets were used for efficacy analysis in this study: 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): All randomized patients. Patients were included in the treatment arm to which 
they were randomized regardless of actual treatment received. This is an intent to treat  (ITT) analysis 
set. This analysis set is used for the analysis of OS. 
PFS Full Analysis Set (PFS-FAS): All patients randomized on or after 05-Mar-2019. Patients were 
included in the treatment arm to which they were randomized regardless of actual treatment received. 
This analysis set is used for the primary analyses of rPFS and all secondary endpoints except ORR and 
DCR. 
The statistical design of the study is such that, to be declared positive, the study would be required to 
reach statistical significance on either rPFS or OS at the respective allocated alpha level. 
rPFS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of radiographic 
disease progression based on the central review assessment per the PCWG3 criteria or death due to 
any cause. The censoring date was the date when the last evaluable radiographic assessment 
(CT/MRI/bone scan) determined a lack of progression. Patients who had 2 or more consecutive missed 
tumor assessments immediately prior to PD or death were censored at the date of the last evaluable 
tumor assessment prior to those missing tumor assessments. 
OS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of death due to 
any cause. If the patient was not known to have died, then OS was censored. The censoring date was 
date of the last study visit, or contact, until the cut-off date. 
EMA/871459/2022  
Page 55/122 
 
 
  
 
 
The primary analysis for rPFS was to test the null hypothesis of a HR of 1.00 and compare the two 
treatment arms using a stratified log-rank test stratifying for the randomization stratification factors. 
The primary analysis of rPFS was based on the PFS-FAS population. The rPFS distribution was 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
A supportive analysis was performed in terms of a stratified Cox regression model with a single 
covariate for randomized treatment arm, stratifying again for the randomization stratification factors. 
The HR for rPFS was calculated, along with its 99.2% CI, from the stratified Cox model.  
The primary analysis of OS was based on the FAS population. For analysis of OS, the same statistical 
methods were used than for rPFS. 
ORR and DCR were analyzed using logistic regression with a single covariate for randomized treatment 
arm and stratification for the randomization stratification factors.  DOR was analyzed in the Response 
Evaluable Analysis Set using mixture distribution methodology. Time to first SSE was summarized and 
analyzed in the same manner as described for rPFS using the PFS-FAS. 
The null hypothesis for rPFS was tested with an alpha level of 0.004 (one-sided). The alpha level 
applicable to OS in the final analysis would depend upon the earlier rPFS and interim OS results (with 
alpha=0.001 spent for the interim OS analysis). The interim analysis was not completed as the 
targeted number of OS events were observed before the targeted number of rPFS events. Therefore, 
the alpha level applicable to OS in the final analysis depends upon the final rPFS results: if p < 0.004 
one-sided is achieved for rPFS, then the alpha level for the final analysis of OS is raised to 0.025 1-
sided; if p < 0.004 one-sided is not achieved for rPFS, then the alpha level for the final analysis of OS 
is 0.021 one-sided. 
To control the overall Type I error rate, if either alternate primary endpoint was met, key secondary 
endpoints were assessed using the Hochberg closed test procedure.  
Sensitivity and supportive analyses were performed to assess the overall robustness of the rPFS 
results. A supplementary analysis of rPFS was also performed using the FAS population.  
Supplementary and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the overall robustness of the OS 
results. A supplementary descriptive analysis of OS was performed using the PFS-FAS population. In 
addition to the primary analysis of OS, a supplementary OS analysis was conducted based on the first 
750 patients randomized in the FAS. A sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of COVID-19 included 
analysis per primary OS analysis but censoring COVID-19 related deaths at the date of death.

Recruitment 
Study initiation date: 29-May-2018 (first patient first visit) 
Data cut-off date: 27-Jan-2021 - The required number of overall survival (OS) events was reached 
to trigger the final OS analysis and primary analysis of rPFS of this study. Enrollment has ended but 
the study is still ongoing 
Conduct of the study 
In total 5 amendments in the study protocol and 4 in the Imaging Endpoint Imaging Manual were 
performed in the trial. As detailed above, particular in the second amendment of the study protocol 
major amendment regarding the objectives and endpoints were performed. It was clarified that the 
changes introduced are not likely to have affected the integrity of the study.  
Protocol deviations were generally more frequent in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm, which seems 
to be related mainly by the longer duration of exposure in this arm (PSMA: 50.6% vs BSC: 38.6%) 
Baseline data 
Overall, a total of 831 patients were randomized and included in the FAS population; 75.3% of whom 
were ≥ 65 years and 92.4% had an ECOG PS score of 0-1. The median time since initial diagnosis was 
7.4 years (range: 0.7, 28.9), almost all (96.3%) had at least one PC-related surgery (including 
biopsies), and 43.2% had received therapeutic surgery. The majority of patients (76.1%) also had at 
least one PC-related radiotherapy, and 79.1% had received more than 3 different regimens of prior 
systemic therapy. All patients had received prior taxane treatment and a prior AR pathway inhibitor 
[There was a low representation of patients who were Black or African American (6.6% of patients 
overall) or Asian (2.4%). 
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics (including prognostic factors) were well balanced 
between the two treatment arms. The population of patients reflects the target population, for whom 
the drug is intended, namely heavily pre-treated patients with progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC. No 
obvious bias due to disease characteristics was revealed from this data after study amendment and 
change of the endpoint. A comparison demonstrated that stratification factors were well balanced 
between the 2 randomized arms at baseline and in the FAS. Subgroup characteristics regarding age 
are shown below:

be related to the higher rate of early drop-out in patients randomized to BSC/BSoC only. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary objective of this study is to compare the two alternate endpoints, rPFS and OS, in 
patients with progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC who received 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC versus 
patients treated by BSC/BSoC only. 
The primary analysis of rPFS was planned to be conducted when 364 rPFS events had been observed in 
patients randomized on or after 05-Mar-2019 with an interim analysis of OS at the time of the rPFS 
analysis using all patients randomized since study commencement. A final analysis of OS, using all 
patients randomized, was planned to take place when 508 deaths have been observed.

Alternate primary endpoint 
1.  Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per BICR: primary analysis based on 
PFS-FAS 
The study met its primary objective, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in 
rPFS based on BICR per PCWG3 criteria for patients receiving 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC 
compared to patients receiving BSC/BSoC only (PFS-FAS; stratified log-rank test p < 0.001, one-
sided). There was an estimated 60% risk reduction of radiographic disease progression or 
death in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm compared with the BSC/BSoC only arm (HR=0.40; 
99.2% CI: 0.29, 0.57; Figure 9).

There were 254 events (66.0%; 171 radiographic progression events and 83 deaths) in the 177Lu-
PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm and 93 events (47.4%; 59 radiographic progression events and 34 deaths) 
in the BSC/BSoC only arm. The median rPFS was prolonged by 5.3 months, from 3.4 months (99.2% 
CI: 2.4, 4.0) in the BSC/BSoC only arm to 8.7 months (99.2% CI: 7.9, 10.8) in the 177Lu-PSMA-

The median follow-up time for rPFS in the PFS-FAS differed between the treatment arms 
(16.4 months in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm and 3.9 months in the BSC/BSoC arm). 
The estimated rPFS rates at 6 months were 64.6% vs. 27.8%, in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC and 
BSC/BSoC only arms, respectively. 
The Kaplan-Meier curves for rPFS per BICR diverged after approximately 8 weeks, corresponding to the 
time of first post-baseline tumor assessment, with the radiographic progression-free probability 
remaining higher during the entire follow-up period for the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm 
than for the BSC/BSoC only arm, indicating an early and sustained advantage for 177Lu-
PSMA-617 therapy (Figure 9). 
The censoring rate for rPFS differed between the treatment arms (34.0% vs. 52.6%); there was a 
greater proportion of patients who were ongoing without an event in the 177Lu-PSMA 617+BSC/BSoC 
arm compared to the BSC/BSoC only arm (23.4% vs. 12.2%). Censoring reasons other than ‘ongoing 
without an event’ were lower in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm relative to the BSC/BSoC only 
arm. 
In addition, rPFS was analyzed in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 + BSC/BSoC arm of the FAS safety analysis set 
also by number of 177Lu-PSMA-617 cycles. Median rPFS for patients who received 4 cycles of 177Lu-
PSMA-617 was 6.4 months (95% CI: 4.3, 7.9), and median rPFS for patients who received 5-6 cycles 
of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was 13.8 months (95% CI: 12.2, 17.0) [SCE Appendix 1-Table 14.2.2.20].

No formal statistical test of hypotheses was performed for these sensitivity analyses. Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted as follows for the primary endpoint rPFS: 
•  Sensitivity analysis 1: 
Includes events regardless of intervening missed assessments. Bone PDs were indicated per PCWG3 
guidelines with modified rules for confirmation after Week 16. Included all radiographic PD and deaths 
captured in the study, including scans not centrally read that were captured on the lost to follow-up 
CRF page 
•  Sensitivity analysis 2: deaths occurring after start of a new anti-cancer therapy were censored 
at the start date of the new therapy. 
•  Sensitivity analysis 3: rPFS was defined from the date of first dose of randomized treatment. 
•  Sensitivity analysis 4: local investigator assessments were used instead of central reading. 
A forest plot of HR with 99.2% CI for the 4 rPFS sensitivity analyses and primary analysis is presented 
in Figure 10. All 4 sensitivity analyses support the rPFS primary endpoint analysis based on the PFS-
FAS and favor the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm.

The study met its primary objective, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in OS for 
patients  receiving  177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC  compared  to  patients  receiving BSC/BSoC only 
(stratified log-rank test p < 0.001, one-sided). There was an estimated 38% risk reduction of death in 
the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm compared with the BSC/BSoC only arm (HR=0.62; 95% CI: 0.52, 
0.74; Figure 11, Table 16).

There were 343 deaths (62.3%) in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. 187 deaths (66.8%) in the 
BSC/BSoC only arm. The median OS was prolonged by 4.0 months, from 11.3 months (95% CI: 9.8, 
13.5) in the BSC/BSoC only arm to 15.3 months (95% CI: 14.2, 16.9) in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm. 
The median follow-up times for OS in the FAS were similar between the treatment arms (20.3 months 
[95% CI: 19.8, 21.0] vs. 19.8 months [95% CI: 18.3, 20.8] in the 177Lu-PSMA- 617+BSC/BSoC and 
the BSC/BSoC only arms, respectively). The estimated OS rates at 12 months were 61.7% vs. 49.0%, 
in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC and the BSC/BSoC only arms, respectively. 
The Kaplan-Meier curves for OS diverged after approximately 2 months, remaining higher during the 
entire follow-up period for the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. the BSC/BSoC arm, indicating an 
early and sustained advantage for 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy (Figure 11). 
The censoring rate for OS differed between the treatment arms (37.7% vs. 33.2%); this appeared to 
be mainly due to 1) a greater percentage of patients who were alive in the 177Lu-PSMA- 
617+BSC/BSoC arm compared with the BSC/BSoC only arm, and 2) fewer patients who withdrew 
consent in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm compared with the BSC/BSoC only arm (Table 16).

Analysis of OS based on first 750 patients randomized (Primary endpoint Assessment before 
Amendment 2) 
In addition to the primary analysis of OS, a supplementary OS analysis was conducted based on the 
first 750 patients randomized in the FAS. The results were similar to those for the primary analysis of 
OS, with a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients receiving 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC 
compared to patients receiving BSC/BSoC only (stratified log-rank test p < 0.001, one-sided). There 
was an estimated 37% risk reduction of death in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm compared with 
the BSC/BSoC only arm (HR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.77) [SCE Appendix 1-Figure 14.2.1.1.3].

In addition, OS was analysed in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 + BSC/BSoC arm of the FAS 
safety analysis set by number of 177Lu-PSMA-617 cycles. Median OS for patients 
who received 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was 11.0 months (95% CI: 9.6, 12.6), 
and median OS for patients who received 5-6 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was 24.7 
months (95% CI: 21.3, 27.6) [SCE Appendix 1-Table 14.2.1.12]. 
Analyses to assess sensitivity of rPFS and OS to censoring due to dropouts 
A panel of analyses were performed to assess sensitivity of rPFS and OS to censoring due to drop-outs. 
The censoring events of principal interest for analysis were “adequate assessment not available” for 
rPFS, and “lost to follow-up” and “withdrawal of consent” for OS. The four types of analyses that were 
performed used published and accepted methods (Lu et al 2015; Atkinson et al 2019). 
The extreme case analysis considered all drop-outs in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm as events. 
The two best case analyses imputed data for drop-outs in the control arm based on the HR in the 20% 
of patients with the longest survival either overall or in the BSC/BSoC only arm. 
The event risk inflation/deflation analysis was based on plausible ranges of increased and decreased 
risk considering possible treatment options after drop-out, with a treatment-specific inflation factor. 
The tipping-point analysis quantified the increase or decrease in the risk of event in patients dropping 
out of the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm or BSC/BSoC only arm that would make the primary 
analysis lose statistical significance. 
The results of these sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analyses of rPFS and OS 
(Table 17).

Key secondary efficacy results 
All 3 key secondary efficacy objectives were met: 
•  ORR was statistically significant in favor of the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm (stratified Wald’s 
Chi-square test p < 0.001, two-sided), with ORR of 29.8% in the 177Lu- PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC 
arm vs. 1.7% in the BSC/BSoC only arm (odds ratio 24.99; 95% CI: 6.05, 103.24); median DoR 
in responders was 9.8 months (95% CI: 9.1, 11.7) in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm 
(median DoR in the BSC/BSoC only arm was not reliable since only 1 of the 2 patients who 
responded had RECIST radiographic progression or death). In the subset of patients with 
measurable disease (at least 1 target lesion per BICR), ORR was 51.1% in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. 3.1% in the BSC/BSoC only arm, with an odds ratio of 37.61 (95% CI: 
8.84, 159.99) [SCE Appendix 1-Table 14.2.3.1.1]. 
•  DCR was also statistically significant in favor of the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm (stratified 
Wald’s Chi-square test p < 0.001, two-sided), with DCR of 89.0% in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. 66.7% in the BSC/BSoC only arm (odds ratio 5.79; 95% CI: 3.18, 
10.55). In the subset of patients with measurable disease (at least 1 target lesion per BICR), DCR 
also favored the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm, with a DCR of 86.4% in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. 50.0% in the BSC/BSoC only arm (odds ratio=10.03; 95% CI: 4.50, 
22.34) [SCE Appendix 1-Table 14.2.3.1.1]. 
•  Time to first SSE favored the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm with an estimated 50% risk 
reduction of symptomatic skeletal event or death that was statistically significant (HR= 0.50; 95% 
CI: 0.40, 0.62; stratified log-rank two-sided p-value: < 0.001). There were 256 events (66.5%; 
60 SSE events and 196 deaths) in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm and 137 events (69.9%; 
34 SSE events and 103 deaths) in the BSC/BSoC only arm. The median time to first SSE was 
delayed by 4.7 months, from 6.8 (95% CI: 5.2, 8.5) months in the BSC/BSoC only arm to 11.5 
months (95% CI: 10.3, 13.2) in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm.

Progression-free survival 
There was an estimated 70% risk reduction of radiographic disease progression based on BICR, clinical 
progression, PSA progression, or death (HR=0.30; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.38) in favor of the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm. 
Median PFS was 5.9 months (95% CI: 5.2, 6.6) in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. 2.4 months 
(95% CI: 2.2, 3.0) in the BSC/BSoC only arm. Median PFS was 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.3, 4.7) for 
patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm who received 4 cycles, and 9.9 months (95% CI: 8.6, 
11.3) for patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm who received 5-6 cycles.

Biochemical response 
Prostate-specific antigen levels: Best percentage change from baseline in PSA level favors the 
177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm, with mean and median decreases of 20.9% and 68.6% respectively 
in this arm, vs. mean and median increases of 50.4% and 24.3% in the BSC/BSoC only arm.

Figure 11: Waterfall plot of best percentage change from baseline in PSA level (PFS-FAS) 
PSA doubling time, proportions of patients with PSA responses (≥ 50% and ≥ 80% decrease from 
baseline), and duration of PSA response were in favor of the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm. PSA 
response as ≥ 50% decrease from baseline occurred in 177/385 (46.0%; 95% CI: 40.9, 51.1) 
patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. 14/196 (7.1%; 95% CI: 4.0, 11.7) patients in the 
BSC/BSoC only arm. It should be noted that the proportion of patients evaluated for PSA doubling 
time was not balanced between the arms: 284/385 (73.8%) patients randomized to the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. 74/196 (37.8%) patients randomized to the BSC/BSoC only arm. 
Alkaline phosphatase levels 
Mean and median baseline ALP levels were similar in both arms, while best percentage change from 
baseline in ALP level favors the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm, with mean and median decreases of 
14.4% and 17.0% respectively in this arm vs. mean 0.6% increase and median 5.0% decrease 
respectively in the BSC/BSoC only arm. 
Lactate dehydrogenase levels 
Mean and median baseline LDH levels were similar in both arms, while best percentage change from 
baseline in LDH level favors the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm, with mean and median decreases of 
23.1% and 23.3% respectively in this arm vs. mean and median decreases of 9.2% of 12.6% 
respectively in the BSC/BSoC only arm. 
Patient-reported outcomes 
PRO results confirmed previous findings in prostate cancer where disease-specific measures, such as 
FACT-P tend to be more sensitive in capturing HRQoL, as well as showing a treatment difference. For 
PRO analyses, worsening also includes clinical progression or death. FACT-P consistently showed an 
estimated 46% risk reduction in worsening from baseline in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm 
compared to BSC/BSoC only arm across its many subscales and components. Specifically, median time 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 69/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
to worsening of the FACT-P total score was delayed by 3.5 months in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC 
arm, with a median time of 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.8, 6.6), compared to 2.2 months (95% CI: 1.8, 
2.8) in the BSC/BSoC only arm.  
Of note, by Cycle 3, approximately 84% of the patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm and 
30% in the BSC/BSoC only arm had PRO data. By Cycle 5, the proportion of patients with data in the 
BSC/BSoC only arm had dropped to approximately 11%. PRO analyses should be interpreted with 
caution due to the relatively lower proportion of patients with PRO data in the BSC/BSoC only arm and 
the differential with the 177Lu-PSMA- 617+BSC/BSoC arm, especially after Cycle 3. This is related to 
the relatively shorter period of time on study treatment in the BSC/BSoC only arm. 
Summary of main efficacy results 
The following Table 19 summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy 
as  well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Notes 
Originally, the primary objective of this study was an arm-to-arm comparison 
of OS. In agreement with the FDA and shortly after study enrollment was 
initiated, the protocol was amended to implement alternate primary 
endpoints, meaning rPFS and OS designated as alternate primary endpoints. 
Because rPFS was a key secondary endpoint at the start of the study, data 
collection to support rPFS analysis as an alternate primary endpoint was 
already in place for all randomized patients. Based on this change, the 
statistical design of the study was such that, to be declared positive, the study 
would be required to reach statistical significance on either rPFS or OS at the 
respective allocated alpha level; it was not required to statistically meet both 
rPFS and OS to be declared a positive study. This was reasoned cy the 
observation that shortly after commencement of the trial, a high rate of 
withdrawal of consent in the BSC/BSoC only arm became evident with the 
majority of these dropouts withdrawing consent to follow-up. This meant that 
rPFS data could not be collected for these patients, which consequently could 
result in bias in the analysis of rPFS. As part of the plan to address the high 
rate of early withdrawal of consent in the BSC/BSoC only arm, the primary 
analysis of rPFS was altered to focus on patients prospectively randomized on 
or after 05-Mar-2019; therefore, rPFS was analyzed on an intent- to-treat 
(ITT) basis in these patients. The OS analysis was also planned on an ITT 
basis and included all randomized patients (i.e. including those randomized 
before 05-Mar-2019).

FINAL 
CONCLUSION. 
The results of Study PSMA-617-01 demonstrated that treatment with 177Lu-
PSMA-617 consistently resulted in statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful improvements in key measures of efficacy, including reduced risk of 
radiographic disease progression or death, a reduced risk of death, increased 
ORR and DCR, and delay in time to first SSE.  
Thus; the pivotal study PSMA-617-01 met its primary objectives for both 
alternate primary endpoints. Statistically significant improvements were 
demonstrated in favor of treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC relative 
to BSC/BSoC only also for all secondary endpoints listed. 
2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
In the sub-study population of VISION (N=30), age in the study population was in the range of 52 to 
80 years (median 67 years) and was not found as a statistically significant covariate in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617 population PK model; therefore, PK is not affected by age. In addition, no overall differences in 
efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and patients <65 years of age. 
Since 177Lu-PSMA-617 is not metabolized by the liver and is eliminated passively through renal 
excretion, PK is unlikely to be affected by ethnic factors. 
No dedicated renal impairment study for 177Lu-PSMA-617 has been conducted. After discussion it is 
now agreed that treatment with Pluvicto in patients with moderate renal impairment, specifically within 
the range of CLcr 30 to < 50 mL/min as well as in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 
mL/min) is not recommended. Treatment with Pluvicto would be allowed in patients with moderate 
renal impairment within the range of CLcr ≥ 50 to 59 mL/min, which reflects the inclusion criteria in 
Study PSMA-617-01.  
Furthermore, the Post Marketing Requirement from FDA, Study CAAA617A12202 (CSR expected to be 
available in Q4 2026) is set to determine the kidney biodistribution, dosimetry, pharmacokinetics, and 
safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 and assess the potential for higher drug exposure and the resultant risk of 
increased serious toxicities in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.  
It is expected that the study will provide additional information in this patient population leading to  
subsequent optimisation of the labelling recommendations. 
As 177Lu-PSMA-617 is not metabolized by, or primarily eliminated through, the liver (Kratochwil et al 
2016), hepatic impairment is unlikely to significantly alter the PK of 177Lu-PSMA-617. Hence, no dose 
adjustment is recommended or needed in patients with hepatic impairment. 
2.6.5.4.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
For diagnostic purposes PSMA was conjugated to gallium-68. This 68Ga-PSMA-11 was used to 
determine patient eligibility based on PET imaging patterns defined by the central read criteria. Only 
patients with at least one PSMA scan-positive lesion identified on PSMA-PET/CT and no PSMA scan-
negative lesion fulfilling the exclusion criteria were to be enrolled in the study, provided all other 
inclusion criteria were met. A total of 1003 patients underwent a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan; 869 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 78/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
patients (86.6%) met the 68Ga-PSMA-11 eligibility criteria to be enrolled in study. For more information 
regarding the analytical details and characteristics please refer to the Quality and PK sections. 
There is sufficient external data that has demonstrated the validity of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for 
localization of recurrent prostate cancer. Using blinded reads and independent lesion validation high 
PPV for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET, detection rate and interreader agreement for localization of recurrent 
prostate cancer is documented (Fendler et al., 2019). Moreover, the diagnostic tool used is under 
assessment in Europe too (parallel). Gozetotide after radiolabelling with gallium-68, is a radioactive 
diagnostic agent indicated for the identification of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive 
lesions by positron emission tomography (PET) in adult patients with prostate cancer. (Details can be 
found in the Assessment reports of the parallel procedure EMEA/H/C/5488.) 
However, it needs to be considered that on the basis of PSMA imaging alone 12.6% of the screened 
patients did not meet the eligibility criteria. Other studies, which assessed for PSMA heterogeneity by 
combining 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and gallium-68 (68Ga)–labeled PSMA-11 scans performed 
with positron-emission tomography–computed tomography (PET–CT), identified a significantly higher 
percentage of patients in the mCRPC population (24 to 33%) harboured one or more FDG-positive, 
PSMA-negative lesions. Since in these patients the outcome with 177Lu-PSMA therapy was poor as 
compared with patients without such lesions (median overall survival, 6.0 months vs. 16.0 months; 
P<0.001) [Hindie, 2021] characterisation of the total tumour burden may be seen as suboptimal. 
However, considering the randomized trial design and the effect size of efficacy, it seems rather 
unlikely that this issue had a significant impact on trial outcome at the end. 
2.6.5.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Given the published data available at the time of PSMA-617-01 study inception, it was hypothesized 
that treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus best supportive care/best standard of care (BSC/BSoC) 
would provide therapeutic benefit for patients with mCRPC who had received at least 1 prior NAAD 
therapy and no more than 2 prior taxane-based chemotherapeutic regimens, and whose disease 
expressed PSMA as determined by a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan. 
To evaluate the PSMA-617-01 data in the context of available therapies in the intended patient 
population, publications describing the use of approved agents for mCRPC in the third-line treatment 
setting are summarized in Table 20. Acknowledging the pitfalls of cross-study comparisons, these 
published clinical studies indicate that treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 induces PSA reduction and 
radiologic response that may exceed the antitumor activity of all currently approved agents being used 
as third-line treatment.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
177Lu-PSMA-617 has been developed as a PSMA-targeted RLT for patients with mCRPC.  
Pivotal study 
The pivotal phase 3 study VISION has a randomised, controlled design. This was supported at SA 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/221527/2019) which is agreed. Patients were randomized (2:1) to either 177Lu-
PSMA-617 + BSC/BSoC or BSC/BSoC only. For readability, however, the study arms are in this 
document referred to as (simply) the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm and the BSC/BSoC arm. 
The study was open-label due to predicted toxicity in the experimental treatment arm and due to 
patient burden of radiation protection protocols in the control arm This can be agreed. 
It is noted that the original version of the study protocol (dated 22-Mar-2018) underwent 3 global 
amendments. The resulting Protocol V4.0 is dated 08-Jul-2019. The first-patient first-visit was on 29-
May-2018 and DCO is 27-Jan-2021. 
Following SA, the Applicant as part of the VISION study conducted a sub-study in a non-randomized 
cohort of approximately 30 patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 at sites in Germany, to evaluate 
radiation dosimetry, PK, ECGs, safety and tolerability, and urinary metabolic stability. The protocol 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 80/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
amendment for including this sub-study (Protocol Amendment 4.1 dated 09-Aug-2019) was thus for 
Germany only. Patients in the sub-study were screened for eligibility, treated and followed-up similar 
to patients in the main study, but these patients were not included in the analyses of the randomized 
part of the study. 
Patient population 
Patients with progressive mCRPC who have previously received treatment with taxane chemotherapy 
and NAAD are limited to receiving BSC/BSoC intervention that is palliative in nature, but which does 
not increase their duration of survival. Progressive mCRPC was documented based on one or more of 
the following criteria as defined per PCWG3: serum PSA progression, soft-tissue progression, or 
progression of bone disease. Per the inclusion criteria, patients had received at least one NAAD (i.e. 
abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide) and at least one but no more than 2 previous taxane-based 
chemotherapy regimens. Thus, it is agreed that the included trial population represents an advanced 
mCRPC population and as reflected in the indication “for the treatment of adult patients with prostate-
specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
who have been treated with androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition and taxane-based 
chemotherapy”. 
Regarding ‘PSMA positivity’ of the disease, patients underwent a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan at 
screening and only patients with PSMA-positive mCRPC as determined by a central reader were 
included.  
At SA, these criteria for definition of PSMA positivity were considered acceptable and using liver as 
‘comparator visual reference’ was considered in accordance with general clinical practice and also 
acceptable. However, the criteria were deemed very strict, excluding every patient with (only) one 
relevant lesion not being PSMA-positive. A broader use in clinical practice after a potential MA was 
expected and it was, therefore, considered that the applied strict criteria would likely need to be 
reflected in the label. See below. It was also noted at SA that when at screening only a limited 
percentage of patients would present with a PSMA-negative status, a justification on the utility of the 
diagnostic test for the selection of patients would be required for the approval of 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
If a patient had received only one taxane regimen, the patient was eligible if the patient’s physician 
deemed him unsuitable to receive a second taxane regimen (e.g., frailty assessed by geriatric or health 
status evaluation or intolerance, etc.). Originally, patients who were not willing to receive a second 
taxane regimen were also allowed to enrol, but with Protocol Amendment 2 (dated 01-Apr-2019 and 
resulting in Protocol V3.0) this was no longer allowed. This is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Also, it is noted that the second taxane regimen would normally be cabazitaxel, that is approved for 
mCRPC patients previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen (Jevtana SmPC), and that has 
shown a benefit in both rPFS and OS in the same disease setting (de Wit et al. N Engl J Med. 2019; 
Jevtana SmPC). 
For inclusion, patients were required to have a life expectancy >6 months. Based on the Applicant 
clarification only 0.8% of the included patients in Study PSMA-617-01 did not meet the inclusion 
criteria of a life expectancy >6 months and only 3 of 1003 patients (0.3%) who were administered 
with did not meet this inclusion criterion. This information excludes a significant effect on the outcome. 
Enrolled patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus BSC/BSoC 
(investigational arm) or BSC/BSoC only (BSC/BSoC-only arm) using a permuted block scheme. This 
randomization ratio was used to provide more patients with a potential beneficial treatment over the 
existing therapies, which is agreed. 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 81/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
Randomization was stratified by 4 factors: LDH (≤260 IU/L vs. >260 IU/L); presence of liver 
metastases (yes vs. no); ECOG performance status score (0 or 1 vs. 2); and inclusion of NAAD in 
BSC/BSoC at time of randomization (yes vs. no). However, in a multi-regional clinical trials, region (or 
country) should usually be a stratification factor. This was not considered. But a subgroup analysis by 
region (North America/Europe) was provided. 
Dose selection 
According to the Applicant, the selection of the 177Lu-PSMA-617 dose and administration schedule in 
the VISION study was based on published clinical studies characterizing the safety and efficacy 
experience with 177Lu-PSMA-617. Further, published radiation dosimetry studies, and a consideration of 
EBRT dose thresholds in organs at risk, provided some general guidance applied to cumulative 
radiation exposures. Lastly, experience with the since 2017 approved 177Lu-radioligand therapeutic 
Lutathera (lutetium [177Lu] oxodotreotide) provided class-based information. It is noted though, that 
the recommended dose regimen for Lutathera is 7.4 GBq Q8W for a total of four cycles (Lutathera 
SmPC), vs. (currently proposed) for 177Lu-PSMA-617 the same dose but Q6W and for 6 cycles. The 
selected dose of 7.4 GBq Q6W for 6 cycles was intended to maximize the probability of efficacy, while 
maintaining safety parameters which are appropriate for the patient population. 
Of note, after four cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment the investigator had to determine whether the 
patient: 1) showed evidence of response; 2) had signs of residual disease; and 3) had tolerated 
treatment well. If the patient met all three criteria, then treatment could be continued up to 6 cycles. 
In CHMP scientific advice, it was recommended to evaluate the feasibility of pre-specified subgroup 
analyses on patient and/or lesion level based on the level of PSMA expression. However, information 
on this matter was not provided, consequently, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This could have 
been important information, as very recently in a multicentre, retrospective study tumour PSMA 
expression and the number of PSMA-positive metastatic lesions were (amongst other factors) 
predictors for OS after 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment (Gafita et al. Lancet Oncol. 2021). Patients in the 
investigational arm received either 7.4 GBq (±10%) 177Lu-PSMA-617 once every 6 weeks (±1 week) 
for up to 6 cycles (a maximum of 6 cycles) plus BSC/BSoC. This posology was based on clinical 
experience with Lutathera and previous clinical studies using 177Lu-PSMA considering dosimetry 
results. It reflects the intention to select a high dose regime to achieve the best efficacy outcome and 
reveals a significant dose escalation compared with the previous experience, combining a high dose, a 
more intensive treatment with shorter recovery periods and more cycles than previous experience. 
Insofar, it seems likely that safety risk are increased compared with published trials using lower 
number of treatment cycles and/or doses.  Previous trials with 177-Lu-PSMA recommended only a dose 
of 4 cycles of 6 GBq every 8 weeks and the German Society of Nuclear Medicine even recommended a 
lower dose of 6.0 GBq dose together with a longer recovery time of 8 weeks for a maximum of 3 cycles 
only (Fendler et al 2016). The reasons for this caution are clearly safety concerns. However, according 
to the available data from external sources in the literature, only the TEAEs dry eyes and diarrhoea 
seemed to be more pronounced (>10% difference) with the higher dose, thereby confirming a higher 
off-target toxicity. However, the reliability of the external data from different trials remains limited due 
to methodological issues. 
Moreover, it is also acknowledged that in the recently published, phase 2 TheraP study in 200 mCRPC 
patients (Hofman et al. Lancet. 2021), that compared 177Lu-PSMA-617 against cabazitaxel, 
177Lu-PSMA-617 was also given Q6W and for up to 6 cycles. The starting dose was 8.5 GBq 177Lu-
PSMA-617 and reduced by 0.5 GBq per cycle, adding up to a cumulative dose of up to 43.5 GBq. This 
dose is similar to the maximum cumulative dose of 44.4 GBq in the VISION study. In the TheraP study, 
46% of the patients who were treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 completed protocol therapy and the 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 82/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
median number of cycles was five (IQR 3–6). Dose reductions were documented in 12 men treated 
with 177Lu-PSMA-617, but treatment was discontinued because of toxicity in only one patient (1%). In 
the TheraP study, treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 seemed to be tolerated well using a dose regimen 
that adds up to a cumulative dose similar to in the VISION study. 
The current posology, which recommends treatment regimen for 177Lu-PSMA-617 for a total of 6 cycles 
(doses) of 7.4 GBq administered intravenously every 6 weeks (± 1 week) is a significant dose 
escalation compared with the previous experience, including a high dose, more intensive treatment 
with shorter recovery periods and more cycles than previous experience. Although it is acknowledged 
that the trial was very successful, it needs also to be considered that the radiation-related off-target 
toxicity was obviously higher than in other trials.,  
In conclusion, the choice for the dose regimen in the VISION study is acceptable, even though it is 
noted that there have been no randomised controlled prospective studies with 177Lu-PSMA-617 in 
patients with mCRPC comparing safety and efficacy of various dose ranges, cycle intervals and number 
of cycles. See the safety section of this AR for discussion on whether there may be a potential for 
ameliorated tolerability at a lower dose level. 
Comparator 
BSC/BSoC for each patient was selected and optimized at the discretion of the patient’s physician prior 
to randomization, and was administered as per the physician’s discretion and protocol at the 
institution. BSC/BSoC therapy included amongst other things ADT, any NAAD (e.g. enzalutamide, 
abiraterone, apalutamide), other hormonal agents, corticosteroids, radiation in any external beam or 
seeded form, and bone-targeted agents (e.g. zoledronic acid, denosumab, bisphosphonates). It 
excluded investigational agents (e.g. olaparib that was investigational at the time), cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (e.g. cabazitaxel), immunotherapy, and other systemic radiopharmaceuticals (e.g. 
223Ra-dichloride). 
At SA, it was fully acknowledged that no clear evidence-based treatment recommendations can be 
given in advanced mCRPC patients that have already been treated with NAAD and taxane-containing 
chemotherapy. Based on this, the BSC/BSoC comparator was considered acceptable. This still holds 
true. It is noted though, that in 2020 olaparib was approved for a subset of the VISION study 
population, i.e. patients with mCRPC and BRCA1/2-mutations who have progressed following prior 
therapy that included a NAAD (Lynparza SmPC). 
Endpoints 
The efficacy population (FAS) comprised 831 randomized patients in Study PSMA-617-01 with mCRPC: 
551 patients were randomized to 177Lu-PSMA-617 (i.v. 7.4 GBq (±10%) once every 6 weeks (±1 
week) for a maximum of 6 cycles) plus BSC/BSoC (investigational arm) and 280 patients were 
randomized to BSC/BSoC only (control arm). As of the data cut-off date of 27-Jan-2021, the median 
study follow-up was 20.9 months.  
Originally, the primary objective of this study was an arm-to-arm comparison of OS. Shortly after 
study enrollment was initiated, the protocol was amended to implement alternate primary endpoints, 
meaning rPFS and OS designated as alternate primary endpoints. In the original protocol rPFS was 
included at the start as the first key secondary endpoint. On February 2019, 44 of 61 patients 
randomized to the control arm had withdrawn consent prior to the first post-baseline radiological 
assessment (Week 8). This meant that rPFS data could not be collected for these patients, which 
consequently could result in bias in the analysis of rPFS. In consequence, the Sponsor initiated a set of 
corrective actions in study conduct at the sites to mitigate this risk, which concerned mainly the 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 83/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
primary objective and the primary endpoint of the trial as detailed in amendment 2 (dated 1. April 
2019). In this amendment, the primary objective and the primary endpoint of Study PSMA-617-01 was 
changed from OS only to two alternate primary endpoints. The previous key secondary endpoint 
radiographic PFS, assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR), was added as a second 
component to the alternate primary endpoints (OS and rPFS).  
Since Progression-free survival (PFS, additional secondary endpoint only) in mCRPC trials has been 
inconsistently defined and is poorly associated with OS, rPFS was chosen as an alternate primary 
endpoint. The use of this alternate primary endpoint is agreed since it is a robust endpoint associated 
with OS and recommended by PCWG3 guidelines (Morris et al 2015, Scher et al 2016, Rathkopf et al 
2018). Moreover, it is noted that the alternate primary endpoints of rPFS and OS were previously used 
in other mCRPC clinical trials (Ryan et al 2013, Beer et al 2014). 
Because rPFS was a key secondary endpoint at the start of the study, data collection to support rPFS 
analysis as an alternate primary endpoint was already in place for all randomized patients. Based on 
this change, the statistical design of the study required to reach statistical significance on either rPFS 
or OS at the respective allocated alpha level to become positive. To minimize the potential for bias in 
the analysis of rPFS due to the differential withdrawal of consent rate between the two treatment 
arms, only patients randomized after full implementation of enhanced study site education measures 
(05-Mar-2019) were to be included in the confirmatory/primary analysis of rPFS, the allocation of alpha 
between rPFS and OS was adjusted to allow for analysis of fewer rPFS events while still maintaining 
the original power for both rPFS and OS, and the total number of patients randomized in the study was 
increased to ensure sufficient events to maintain power. 
Statistical methods 
It is noted that the original version of the SAP is dated 08-Jun-2018, Version 2.0 is dated 24-Oct-2019, 
and Version 3.0 is dated 18-Jan-2021. The last date is only a few days before the DCO for the open-
label VISION study, i.e. 27-Jan-2021. 
The approach to use the alternate primary endpoints is deemed justified and was agreed in a SAWP 
advice considering the ICH E9 Guideline “Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials” (EMA 1998), as well as 
in the EMA “Guideline on multiplicity issues in clinical trials” (EMA 2017). This detailed that when using 
alternate primary endpoints, although demonstration of a treatment effect on at least one of the 2 
primary endpoints is sufficient, results for all of the prespecified primary endpoints (rPFS and OS in this 
case), both positive and negative, are considered in the overall assessment of risks and benefits.  
However, it was clarified in the advice that the OS analysis should still include all randomized patients 
from the start of the study (EMA Scientific Advice 2019) and therefore allows additionally a valid 
analysis of the initial primary endpoint OS only.  
With respect to methodical aspects, it needs to be considered that the statistical analysis plan was not 
finalized before the beginning of this open-label study, however, the analyses described in the SAP are 
consistent with the ones in the study protocol and changes to study design (primary endpoint, analysis 
populations) were not critical for study success. It is agreed that the changes maintained all of the 
assumptions of clinical benefit on which the study was originally powered. The pre-specified multiplicity 
strategy provided adequate control of the family-wise type 1 error rate for the primary endpoints and 
key secondary endpoints. 
The censoring rules for rPFS were generally in line with the relevant EMA guideline (CHMP/27994/2008 
Rev. 1) besides censoring of patients with two consecutive missed tumour assessments immediately 
prior to event. A sensitivity analysis considering these patients as events was provided; however, as 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 84/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
more additional categories of rPFS events were also introduced in this analysis, it is also not identical 
with the EMA-preferred analysis.  
As a result of the corrective actions, withdrawal of consent from treatment with BSC/BSoC 
subsequently decreased from 28.6% to 11.2%.  
As frequently in trials comparing an investigational product with BSC/BSoC, duration of exposure to 
randomized treatment for the 2 randomized arms was significantly shorter in the BSC/BSoC arm 
(Median: PSMA: 7.8 months vs BSC only: 2.1 months).  
Key secondary endpoints after amendment 2 included an arm-to-arm comparison of ORR and DCR as 
measured by RECIST v1.1, as well as time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE). Secondary 
endpoints have been defined by PCWG3 as well as FDA and EMA guidance. It is agreed that these 
endpoints are clinically meaningful and informative in order to provide evidence regarding the 
roboustness of the trial outcome. 
Similarly, the additional secondary endpoints including PFS (radiographic, clinical, or PSA progression), 
biochemical response as measured by change over time in PSA, PSA doubling time, alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), PSA response and duration of PSA response are 
assessed as clinically relevant and may indicate robustness of outcome.  
In view of the highly symptomatic nature of advanced mCRPC both validated pain measurements (the 
BPI-SF) and HRQoL measurements (the EQ-5D-5L and the FACT-P) were collected using various 
questionnaires. In conclusion, all secondary endpoints used are acceptable and generally fully in 
accordance with PCWG3 as well as FDA and EMA guidance recommendations. 
Although the applicant’s justification that the change to implement alternate primary endpoints does 
not negatively affect the OS endpoint and full integrity was maintained for this endpoint and for the 
study may be correct, additional clarification regarding this issue was requested both, from a 
methodological and clinical point of view. From the submitted details and additional explanations it is 
agreed that, the overall reliability of the data is not further challenged since the change in population 
before and after the amendment differs even in a worst case analysis would not have led to imbalances 
in prognosis. 
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had minimal impact on this study, since enrolment was completed on 
23-Oct-2019 (prior to the beginning of the pandemic in Europe and North America), and the last dose 
of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was administered on 26-Jun-2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to 
the conduct of this study were implemented to ensure the safety and well-being of study participants, 
and to enable trial oversight and compliance with the study protocol. Six patients discontinued 177Lu-
PSMA-617 due to the pandemic, and they all had already received at least 4 cycles of study drug. 
Missed assessments or procedures due to the pandemic were estimated to represent less than 0.25% 
of the data to be collected and 3 deaths were related to COVID-19 infections. Based on results of 
sensitivity analyses presented to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the evaluation of the 
alternate primary endpoints, it is agreed that the pandemic had no relevant impact on the alternate 
primary efficacy endpoint evaluations (data not shown).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The pivotal trial PSMA-617-01 has shown convincing and roboust evidence that treatment with 177Lu-
PSMA-617 leads to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in key measures of 
efficacy in the intended target population.  
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 85/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
With respect to the alternate primary endpoint it is noted that –although not essentially needed – both 
endpoint component were highly statistically significant (p< 0.001) in favour for patients treated with 
with 177Lu- PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC relative to BSC/BSoC only. Roboustness is indicated by statistically 
high significant differences in favour for the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm compared with 
BSC/BSoC alone arm for all key secondary as well as the additional secondary endpoints selected. 
For rPFS, there was an estimated 60% risk reduction of radiographic disease progression or death (HR 
= 0.40; 99.2% CI: 0.29, 0.57; stratified log-rank test p < 0.001, one-sided) and median rPFS was 
prolonged by 5.3 months, from 3.4 months (99.2% CI: 2.4, 4.0) in the BSC/BSoC only arm to 8.7 
months (99.2% CI: 7.9, 10.8) in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm. The presented results of 
sensitivity analyses for rPFS as well as an additional analysis of rPFS based on the FAS was also 
supportive of the primary analysis were supportive for the primary analysis result. Moreover, an rPFS 
improvement of five months may allow presuming some improvement in quality of life for patients 
also. However, since the return rate of the PRO questionnaires was extremely limited (11%), this 
effect is not sufficiently reliable to be confirmative. Nevertheless, it is noted that in difference to other 
approved mCRPC therapies, such as radium-223, also a rPFS benefit was documented in addition to 
increased overall survival. 
Similarly, for OS, a statistically significant and clinical relevant estimated 38% risk reduction of death 
(HR =0.62; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.74; stratified log-rank test p < 0.001, one-sided) was observed. This 
correlates to a prolongation in median OS of 4.0 months, from 11.3 months (95% CI: 9.8, 13.5) in the 
BSC/BSoC only arm to 15.3 months (95% CI: 14.2, 16.9) in the177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm. 
With respect to the changes performed in the efficacy evaluation and the change of the primary 
endpoint OS only to an alternative endpoint consisting of rPFS and OS, the results of a supplementary 
OS analysis based on the first 750 patients randomized in the FAS are reassuring. This approach 
mimics the OS analysis as planned in the initial protocol and resulted -consistently with the primary 
analysis results- to an HR of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.77) favoring the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm 
(stratified log-rank test p < 0.001, one-sided) in a similar range again. Furthermore, an additional OS 
analysis conducted on the PFS-FAS was consistent with and supportive of the primary analysis (HR = 
0.63; 95%CI, 0.51, 0.79; stratified Log-rank test p < 0.001, one-sided).  
However, it needs to be considered that the difference between both arms in trial PSMA-617-01 was in 
the same range as observed in other controlled clinical trials in the mCRPC target population (Radium-
223 vs BSoC, ALSYMPCA trial : 3.6 months or Olaparip vs Abi/Enza, PROfound trial : 3.4 months). 
Insofar, in the advance mCRPC population the treatment option with 177-Lu-PSMA is seen as 
important, although not dramatically changing the fate of the patient. However, this was also not 
expected. 
Results of analyses performed to assess sensitivity of rPFS and OS to censoring due to drop-outs were 
in general fully consistent with and supportive of the primary analysis results and may allow to 
presume that the initial high drop-out rate had no impact on the interpretation or robustness of the 
primary analysis results. Similarly, homogeneity and consistency of the alternate primary endpoints 
rPFS and OS were also evident across subgroups, including the baseline stratification factors, age, 
region, baseline PSA, prior therapies, and concurrent therapies, demonstrating a consistent 177Lu-
PSMA-617 treatment effect. The only exception was subgroups with too few patients to be 
interpretable (e.g. Asian, African American or Black, and baseline PSADT >9 months).  
From a methodical point of view, it is appreciated that sensitivity analyses were pre-specified 
addressing the influence of censoring rules and definition of rPFS events, and that additional analyses 
on the influence of COVID-19 were conducted. Considering the (non-differential) drop-out with early 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 86/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
withdrawals of consent in the control arm, additional analyses were provided for OS and rPFS (both for 
PFS-FAS and FAS).  
Also reverse Kaplan-Meier curves (i.e. reversing event and censoring) were provided and additional 
Cox regression analyses adjusting for additional covariates (reasons for trial discontinuation) were 
conducted. It was clarified that differential censoring occurred for OS, which was mainly due to ~10% 
early drop-outs in the control arm (probably explained by the issue with withdrawal of consent) while 
no further differentiation occurred during later follow-up.  
For rPFS, it was already known that considerable early differential drop-out occurred as this was the 
reason for introducing corrective actions and re-defining the primary analysis population for the rPFS 
analysis. However, there was still considerable early drop-out in the PFS-full analysis set (> 20% 
censoring at time 0, with further differentiation after 2 months, i.e. first PFS assessment time point).  
In summary, the panel of additional analyses convincingly demonstrated that differential drop-out had 
no critical influence on the conclusions from the study.  
The study met also all key secondary efficacy objectives, with highly statistically significant 
improvements in favor of treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC relative to BSC/BSoC only. 
At SA, it was advised to evaluate the feasibility of pre-specified subgroup analyses on patient and/or 
lesion level based on the level of PSMA. The Applicant performed a pre-planned, exploratory 
quantitative analysis to assess the association of baseline 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT parameters with rPFS, 
OS, and other efficacy endpoints only on the patients randomized to the 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment 
arm. This is not (fully) understood and is regrettable, as the quantitative analysis thus only considers 
prognostic factors for efficacy outcomes under 177LuPSMA-617 + BSC/BSoC treatment, rather than 
predictive factors for improved efficacy relative to BSC/BSoC alone. Therefore, no firm conclusions can 
be drawn. It would have been preferred to include (scans of) patients from both treatment arms in the 
quantitative analysis to potentially identify subgroups of patients that benefit more from adding 
177LuPSMA-617 to BSC/BSoC. 
As the nature of any additional analysis/analyses will also be exploratory and moreover, post hoc, the 
results thereof are unlikely to (significantly) impact the benefit-risk assessment. 
Although the reliability of PRO-outcome in an open trial design may be challenged, it should be noted 
that also results in favor of treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC relative to BSC/BSoC only 
were also observed for PROs, indicating patient stabilization/slower deterioration while on treatment. 
FACT-P total score showed an estimated 46% reduction in risk of worsening, clinical progression or 
death (HR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.66; Cox two-sided p-value: < 0.001) in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm compared to the BSC/BSoC only arm and BPI-SF pain intensity scale showed that 
time to worsening was delayed by 3.7 months in 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm compared to 
BSC/BSoC only arm. 
With respect to efficacy in special populations, age in the trial was not found as a statistically 
significant covariate in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 population PK model; claiming that PK is not affected by 
age. In addition, no overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age 
and patients <65 years of age.  
Treatment with Pluvicto in not recommended in patients with renal impairment with baseline CLcr < 50 
mL/min. Treatment with Pluvicto in patients with renal impairment within the range of CLcr ≥ 50 to 59 
mL/min is acceptable. This recommendation is in accordance with the Study PSMA-617-01 inclusion 
criterion #14.c.  
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 87/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
Furthermore, it needs to be considered that the presented subgroup analyses have shown that only 
6.6% of Black/African American and only 2.4 % Asians were included. Considering that the highest 
death rate in Prostate cancer is observed in Black/African Americans, this limitation is important.  
Most relevant, external data from other trial in PSMA-positive mCRPC who progressed standard 
therapies, including antiandrogen therapies (abiraterone, enzalutamide or both) and taxane based 
chemotherapy (docetaxel or cabazitaxel), or who were not eligible for chemotherapy is available. 
These data show consistency with respect to the results of Study PSMA-617-01 and thereby reliably 
confirm the clinical relevant benefit as reported from the here discussed pivotal trial.  
Since metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer does not occur in a paediatric population, and 
there are no other indications known at this time that are likely to benefit a product specific waiver was 
granted and no specific considerations for the paediatric population are seen. 
Supportive study 
The supportive phase 2 study PSMA 617-02 (RESIST-PC; NCT03042312) was a prospective, open-label 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 and was conducted at 2 treatment 
centres. This study enrolled patients with progressive, PSMA-positive mCRPC previously treated with ≥ 
1 NAAD and who were either taxane-naive or taxane pre treated. Enrolled patients were randomized to 
one of two 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment doses, i.e. 6.0 GBq (± 10%) or 7.4 GBq (± 10%) every 8 ± 1 
weeks until reaching 4 cycles (or threshold maximum dose to the kidneys of 23 Gy). Patients were able 
to receive BSC/BSoC during the study. The primary objectives of the study were 1) to assess the 
clinical safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617; and 2) to assess the efficacy as defined by proportion of patients 
with PSA response ≥ 50% decline at 12 weeks from baseline. In total, 200 patients were scheduled to 
be enrolled. 
However, enrolment was terminated early by the study Sponsor, since the study was not consistent 
with the overall strategy of the company. Due to only limited PSA data being available for the number 
of actual patients enrolled being 71, the efficacy endpoints were not analysed as planned in the 
protocol. The only efficacy analyses performed using the limited data available were for 
clinicaltrials.gov, as this website requires all available data for primary and secondary endpoints to be 
disclosed. It is agreed with the Applicant that there was insufficient data to draw reliable conclusions. 
Therefore, no efficacy results of the supportive study RESIST-PC will be discussed here. This study is 
only providing supportive safety data in this application, see the safety section of this AR. 
Wording of indication 
The Applicant originally proposed the following indication: 
“177Lu-PSMA-617 is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with PSMA-positive mCRPC who have 
been treated with AR pathway inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy.” 
According to (the most) recent EMA guidance (EMA/CHMP/483022/2019) there is a need to specify in 
the indication wording whether Pluvicto should be used as monotherapy or in combination with other 
products. Considering that in the VISION study 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment was given in combination 
with BSC/BSoC, with castration as essential backbone thereof englobed as “androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT)” that also encompasses surgical castration, and that androgen receptor (AR) pathway 
inhibition was not mandatory, the indication was agreed to be updated to reflect that 177Lu-PSMA-617 
is indicated in combination with ADT with or without AR pathway inhibition. 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 88/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the pivotal study VISION, treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 showed an improvement in both primary 
endpoints of rPFS by BICR and OS compared with treatment with BSC/BSoC, of which the OS benefit is 
considered clinically relevant. The OS data/results are considered sufficiently mature for B/R 
assessment and are considered robust, as all performed sensitivity/supportive analyses support the OS 
primary analysis and all subgroup analyses for OS provided results consistent with this analysis. 
The rPFS result and the results for the key secondary endpoints (ORR, DCR, and SSE) are considered 
to provide support for the OS result. 
The final wording of the indication was updated to reflect that 177Lu-PSMA-617 is indicated in 
combination with ADT with or without AR pathway inhibition. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
Safety data for 177Lu-PSMA-617was provided derived from the two studies PSMA-617-01 (pivotal) and 
PSMA-617-02 (supportive). 
Pivotal (Main source of safety information) 
Study PSMA-617-01; FAS-Safety analysis set includes 529 patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm (who were treated with at least one non-zero dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617), and 205 
patients in the BSC/BSoC only arm. 
Supportive 
Study PSMA-617-02: Safety Population comprised 23 patients in the 6.0 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-617 group, 
and 41 patients in the 7.4 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-617 group. Since patients in this study did not consistently 
receive BSoC along with 177Lu-PSMA-617, data from these patients are presented separately as 
supportive safety evidence. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Recommended Posology: 
The recommended dose for 177Lu-PSMA-617 is 7 400 MBq (200 mCi) every 6 weeks (±1 week) for a 
total of 6 doses.  
Duration of exposure 
Duration of exposure was longer and the mean/median number of cycles started by the patients were 
higher in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm due to the longer time spent on the study by patients 
randomized to this arm. 
An overview of the duration of exposure to randomized treatment for the 2 randomized arms is 
provided in Table 21.

Drug-related is related to any study drug (177Lu-PSMA-617 or BSC/BSoC) as assessed by the 
investigator.  
[1] Four patients randomized to 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm received BSC/BSoC only, and 
therefore contribute to the FAS safety analysis set of the BSC/BSoC arm, see [Study PSMA-617-01-
Section 10.1.2]. Source: [Study PSMA-617-01-Table 14.3.2.1] 
TEAEs were usually more frequent in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm than in BSC/BSoC only arm 
for all categories (except TEAEs leading to reduction of BSC/BSoC).  
As shown in the Table 23above, the differences were more pronounced for the drug-related TEAEs 
(85.3% patients vs. 28.8% patients), drug-related grade 3/4/5 TEAEs (28.4% patients vs. 3.9% 
patients), and grade 3/4/5 TEAEs (52.7% patients vs. 38.0% patients). Serious drug related TEAEs

were more than threefold higher in patients exposed to 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC. Insofar, the 
treatment has clearly a higher risk than BSC/BSoC alone. 
TEAEs reported with respect to primary SOC and maximum grade in PSMA-617-01 are presented in

The greatest differences (≥10%) in the incidence of TEAEs according PT between the 2 
treatment arms (177Lu- PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. BSC/BSoC only arm) were observed for: 
• 
Fatigue: 43.1% patients versus 22.9% patients 
•  Dry mouth: 38.8% patients versus 0.5% patients 
•  Nausea: 35.3% patients versus 16.6% patients 
•  Anemia: 31.8% patients versus 13.2% patients 
•  Diarrhea: 18.9% patients versus 2.9% patients 
•  Vomiting: 18.9% patients versus 6.3% patients 
• 
• 
• 
Thrombocytopenia: 17.2% patients versus 4.4% patients 
Lymphopenia: 14.2% patients versus 3.9% patients 
Leukopenia: 12.5% patients versus. 2.0% patients 
•  Urinary tract infection: 11.0% patients versus 1.0% patients 
Overall, high grade TEAEs (grade ≥3) were reported as relatively infrequent (<5.0% patients) 
in both arms, except for the following events which were more frequent in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm versus the BSC/BSoC only arm:  
•  anemia (12.9% patients vs. 4.9% patients),  
• 
• 
• 
thrombocytopenia (7.9% patients vs.1.0% patients),  
lymphopenia (7.8% patients vs. 0.5% patients), and  
fatigue (5.9% patients vs. 1.5% patients).  
These grade ≥ 3 AEs of the blood and lymphatic system and fatigue were anticipated for 177Lu- PSMA-
617 considering the administration of therapeutic levels of the radioactive compound in these patients 
with advanced cancer. It may be noted that though these events were more frequent as expected with 
this treatment (occurring in the range of 6-13% frequency, approximately), they only led to permanent 
discontinuation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in ≤3.0% of patients.  
In conclusion, the safety outcome could be expected to some degree for 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy 
from available external literature data and these events reflect known toxicities from the radiation 
resulting from 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment. In general, the TEAEs fully reflect the locations 
characterised as relevant off-targets. No new or unexpected safety concern was raised during 
treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 in the PSMA-617-01 study.  
Adverse events of special interest: 
From the data in literature 177Lu-PSMA-617 is already known to increase risk of Fatigue, Dry mouth, 
Myelosuppression (including anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia), Nausea and 
Vomiting, and Renal effects. It is acknowledged that all these AESI can be attributed to the mechanism 
of action of 177Lu-PSMA-617 or can be associated with active anti-cancer treatment.  
Fatigue event is frequent in an advanced cancer population per se; however, this TEAE was clearly 
more frequently reported in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm (49.1% patients) as compared to 
the BSC/BSoC only arm (29.3% patients). Since event probability estimates show also a higher 
probabilities of fatigue in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm than the BSC/BSoC-only arm, this is 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 93/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
clearly a safety risk associated to the radiation treatment. However, events of fatigue leading to 
withdrawal of 177Lu-PSMA-617 were infrequent (0.4%). 
Myelosuppression: The frequency of myelosuppression related events (including anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia) was higher in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm 
(47.4% patients) as compared to the BSC/BSoC only arm (17.6% patients). Similarly, high 
grade (≥3) events of myelosuppression were higher in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm (23.4% 
patients vs. 6.8% patients), as were the SAEs (5.1% patients vs. 0.5% patients). 
Myelosuppression related events leading to withdrawal of 177Lu-PSMA-617 were frequent 
(7.0% patients). Event probability estimates show clearly higher probabilities of myelosuppression 
events in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm than the BSC/BSoC-only arm. 
Three events suspected to be drug-related by the Investigator with fatal outcomes were 
reported, all in 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm: 2 deaths due to pancytopenia and 1 death due to 
bone marrow failure. The cases of pancytopenia and their clinical courses were complicated by 
progressive cancer and bone marrow involvement. The third patient was reported to have bone 
marrow failure on the same day as the first administration of 177Lu-PSMA-617 and died 18 days later. 
On review he had profound anemia at screening and subsequently treatment-emergent 
thrombocytopenia was reported. At the time of patient’s death, the events (fatigue, pain, dyspnoea, 
dry mouth, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, vomiting, weight decreased, and poor quality of sleep) were 
ongoing. It is not fully clear whether he suffered bone marrow failure as a result of 177Lu-PSMA-617 
treatment or bone marrow metastasis or other drugs had also impacted this outcome. 
Lacrimal Toxicity: Radiation exposure of lacrimal glands it of particular interest, since dosimetry 
studies revealed this location as the region with the highest absorbed dose. In the pivotal Study PSMA-
617-01 the number and severity of events reflecting lacrimal toxicity was rather low. Dry eye was only 
reported by 16 (3.0%) patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm, and 2 (1.0%) patients in the 
BSC/BSoC only arm. These were all grade 1 events and need no specific treatment, except for 1 
related grade 2 event. Blurred vision as a potential complication of dry eyes events was reported by 9 
(1.7%) patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm, and by 2 (1.0%) patients in the BSC/BSoC 
only arm. However, two (0.4%) of these patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm had high 
grade (≥3) with blurred vison events. Additional factors like pre-existing eye comorbidities or 
medication may be involved in these cases too. 
Dry Mouth: Dry Mouth is a focused topic consisting almost entirely of reports of “Dry Mouth”, but with 
2 cases of Aptyalism. In the salivary glands, the mean radiation absorbed dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was 
0.63±0.36 Gy/GBq, which was on the lower side of the wide range of mean values (0.498 - 1.90 
Gy/GBq) reported in the literature. Study PSMA-617-01 Safety-wise, treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 
has been associated with a frequent but relatively low severity of salivary gland toxicity (dry 
mouth/xerostomia) as reported in the literature (68% reversible grade 1/2 dry mouth reported by 
Hofman et al (2019). In accordance with this, and as anticipated from the mechanism of action and 
distribution to the salivary glands, this was a very frequently reported event in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC group (38.8% patients), but was infrequently reported in the BSC/BSoC only arm 
(0.5% patients). At data cut-off, more patients had unresolved events (26.1% patients) than resolved 
(13.2% patients) in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm. 
Nausea and vomiting: As expected for a radiation-product for RLT, the frequency of nausea and 
vomiting was significantly higher than for BSC/BSoC alone. These types of AEs were approximately 
twice as high in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm (39.3% patients) as compared to the BSC/BSoC 
only arm (17.1% patients) as was expected. However, high grade events (≥3) were infrequent in either 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 94/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
arm (1.5% patients vs. 0.5% patients) and only 1 (0.2%) patient was withdrawn from 177Lu-PSMA-617 
treatment due to this category of events and in the BSC/BSoC.  
Renal function: Renal Effects was selected as a safety topic of interest due to PSMA expression in the 
proximal tubule, and the known renal route of 177Lu-PSMA-617 excretion. In the kidneys, the mean 
radiation absorbed dose was 0.43 ± 0.16 Gy/GBq, which is even lower than the lower end of the range 
of mean kidney radiation absorbed doses reported in the literature (0.49 - 0.991 Gy/GBq).  
Renal events were more frequent in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm [46 (8.7%) 
versus 12 (5.9%) patients]. However, the incidence of high grade ≥3 events were similar between 
arms (3.4% patients vs. 2.9% patients) and there were no grade 4 or 5 renal events (i.e no events 
had a fatal outcome) in either arm; SAEs were even reported more frequently in the BSC/BSoC arm 
(3.4% patients) as compared to the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm (1.7% patients). Nevertheless, 
the only event of renal failure was reported in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm and the rate of 
not recovered renal adverse events was higher in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm (3.4% versus 
1.5%).  
In general, a higher risk for renal impairment is likely to occur with RLT with 177Lu-PSMA-617 in 
comparison with BSC/BSoC below a CCl of 54 mL/min. 
Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic metastatic disease at baseline was balanced between the arms (11.0% 
versus 11.2%) and also hepatotoxicity events were reported with a similar incidence (≤5% 
differences) in both arms (10.2% patients vs. 7.8% patients). The high grade (≥3) events were of 
similar frequency (2.8% patients vs. 2.4% patients) in both arms, as were the SAEs (0.9% patients vs. 
1.0% patients). No patient in either arm had a constellation of values indicative of Hy's law during 
randomized treatment. 2 fatal cases were not assessed as drug-related. 
QT Prolongation: 177Lu-PSMA-617 at the studied doses in the sub-study had no observed clinically 
relevant effects on QTcF. No event of “QT Prolongation” was reported in the PSMA-617-01 main 
study.The available hERG data indicate the absence for particular risks regarding QT prolongation from 
the product.  
Second Primary Malignancies: Few patients had second primary malignancies events (13, 1.8% 
patients); the incidence was higher in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm as compared to the 
BSC/BSoC only arm (11, 2.1% patients vs. 2, 1.0% patients), however, the observation periods were 
significantly shorter in the BSC/BSoC only arm.  
Reproductive Toxicity: This safety topic of interest was regarded as a potential risk due to the 
nature of this RLT treatment targeting a cancer of the genitourinary tract, even though the study 
population of mCRPC patients was considered not to have reproductive potential. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
In the pivotal PSMA-617-01 study, as could be expected in a BSC/BSoC only-comparative trial, more 
patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm than in the BSC/BSoC only arm had SAEs 
(177-Lu-PSMA: 36.3% vs BSC/BSoC only: 27.8%). The impact of radiation toxicity on safety 
becomes even more clearly in the frequency of drug-related SAEs, which occurred threefold in 9.3% 
patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm and 2.4% patients in the BSC/BSoC only arm. 
The SOCs with TEAEs reported in at least ≥5% of the patients in either arm were (177-Lu-PSMA vs 
BSC/BSoC only) were infections and infestations (9.8% patients vs. 4.4% patients) followed by 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 95/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
nervous system disorders (6.8% patients vs. 7.8% patients) and blood and lymphatic system disorders 
(5.1% patients vs. 0.5% patients). Infections (Urosepsis, Pneumonia) and blood disorder (Cytopenia) 
are likely to be mostly drug related complications, while nervous system disorder SAEs may mainly 
reflect cerebral manifestation of the underlying disease.  
Deaths 
Overall, 85 patients died while on-treatment. More patients died patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm than in the BSC/BSoC only arm [66 patients (177Lu-PSMA-617: 12.5% vs. 
BSC/BSoC only: 19 patients (9.3%)]. The most frequent primary cause of death during 
randomized treatment in both arms was disease progression (8.3% patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. 6.8% patients in the BSC/BSoC only arm). 
SAEs with fatal outcomes occurred only slightly more in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm: 19 
(3.6%) patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm (including 1 disease progression and 1 
COVID-19); and 6 (2.9%) patients in the BSC/BSoC only arm (including 1 disease progression). 
However, again the difference of treatment duration on randomized treatment between the arms need 
to be considered for interpretation, since it was significantly shorter in the BSC/BSoC only arm.

The most frequent myelosuppression-related adverse events were anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, leukopenia, and neutropenia, which may be attributed to 
the effects of ionizing radiation on sensitive precursor cells in circulation or in the bone marrow close to 
metastatic bone lesions, but which may also be impacted by bone marrow impairment at baseline from 
prior therapy. These shifts were mainly by 1 or 2 grades up, with some shifts to grade 4. None of these 
hematological parameter shifts caused any unexpected safety concerns.  
The following differences regarding hematology were noted between the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm compared with the BSC/BSoC only arm [inclusive of the high grade 
abnormalities (grade 3/4)]: low lymphocytes level (grade 3/4 abnormalities: 50.9% patients vs. 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 96/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
19.0% patients); anemia (grade 3/4 abnormalities: 15.1% patients vs. 6.3% patients); and low 
platelets (grade 3/4 abnormalities: 9.3% patients vs. 2.4% patients).  
However, it is noted that, despite these expected hematology abnormalities, anemia, lymphocytopenia 
or thrombocytopenia that led to permanent discontinuation remained infrequent (<3.0% patients 
each); and these were observed with similar incidences in both treatment arms during randomized 
treatment. 
In the BSC/BSoC only arm also a general trend of shifts towards higher grade abnormalities during 
randomized treatment was observed for low lymphocytes and low leukocytes, but to a lower extent 
and with relatively fewer shifts to higher grade abnormalities (grade 3 or 4) as compared to the 177Lu-
PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm due to the absence of additional radiotoxicity. However, it needs to be 
considered that the current exposure probably not fully reflect the intended treatment duration of 6 
cycles as recommended in the product information. It may be expected that particularly 
haematotoxicity will be more pronounced than obvious from the current data during longer treatment 
periods as foreseen in the SmPC. 
The applicant reports that there was one case of AML observed during long term follow-up.  
Clinical chemistry abnormalities observed during randomized treatment were generally similar in 
both treatment arms (≤10% differences) with few noteworthy exceptions of hyponatremia (38.2% 
patients vs. 24.9% patients); hypocalcemia (43.1% patients vs. 31.7% patients); and AST increased 
(31.2% patients vs. 21.0% patients). In both treatment arms, grade 3 / 4 abnormalities were 
infrequent (<3.0% patients). Some shifts to higher grades were observed during the randomized 
treatment period but there was no trend; and none of these shifts raised any safety concerns. 
The liver function parameters were similar in both arms, and no notable high frequency was observed 
for any of the hepatic laboratory categories. The laboratory data did not raise any hepatic safety 
concerns. No patient in either arm had a constellation of values indicative of Hy's law during the 
randomized treatment. Also, during long term follow-up, liver function parameters were similar 
between both the groups of patients and similar to what was observed during the randomized 
treatment. 
Analysis of serum testosterone failed to demonstrate clear trends or changes. Almost all patients had 
low testosterone level at baseline as per the inclusion criteria (<50 ng/dL or <1.7 nmol/L) and no 
shifts from low to normal testosterone levels were observed during randomized treatment. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
The majority of the patient population in Study PSMA-617-01 was elderly (≥ 65 years), with only about 
one quarter of patients being below the age of 65 years at baseline. This is consistent with the median 
age at diagnosis of mCRPC being 70 years (Flaig et al 2016).

As shown in Table OS-6 above, the incidence of TEAEs (by most type and severity) were mostly 
slightly higher in the elderly subgroups of patients (≥65-<75 years age group and ≥75 years age 
group) in both arms, as compared to the <65 years age group. However, the differences were mostly 
≤10%, with few exceptions.  
Subgroup analyses present revealed a tendency towards higher incidences and severity in patients 
with ECOG score of 2 at baseline versus ECOG score 0 or 1, in patients ≥65 years, patients with 
abnormal eGFR and proteinuria levels, renal impairment, and patients with concurrent radiation 
therapy in both the treatment arms; however, the shifts were more frequent in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm.  
Within treatment arms, in both arms, the differences in incidence of TEAEs including TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation were ≤10% for White, and Black or African American patients with few exceptions. 
These differences were not notable and as the sample sizes were too low. 
The proportion of White patients in each arms was highly predominant, while the number of Asian 
patients (<10 patients per arm) and Black or African American was relatively low. Hence, again these 
results should be interpreted with caution. 
With respect to renal function at baseline, in both arms, the incidence of TEAEs by type and severity 
was slightly higher in the patients who had abnormal eGFR and positive proteinuria levels (impaired) 
versus not (non-impaired); however the differences were mostly ≤20% with few exceptions.

In the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm, the differences between impaired versus non-impaired 
groups were greater for high grade TEAEs (77.4% patients vs. 50.5% patients), and serious TEAEs 
(67.7% patients vs. 32.9% patients). Similar difference (50.0% patients vs. 26.4% patients) was 
noted in the BSC/BSoC only arm for the serious TEAEs. In particular, the incidence of fatal TEAEs, 
though low in number overall, was 4 times more in the impaired group as compared with the non-
impaired (12.9% patients vs. 3.0% patients) in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm and more than 2 
times in the impaired group as compared with the non-impaired in the BSC/BSoC only treatment arm 
(7.1% patients vs. 2.7% patients). 
With respect to the NAAD medication within each treatment arm, in both arms, the difference in 
incidences of TEAEs overall, by type and severity were generally ≤10%, in the presence or absence of 
NAAD during the randomized treatment; except for drug-related TEAEs in the BSC/BSoC only arm 
(37.4% patients vs. 10.6% patients). 
Overall, no other clinically relevant trend or pattern was observed from the subgroup analyses 
presented. Considering the partially low numbers in the subgroups meaningful interpretation of 
changes observed seemed challenging and less reliable; chance findings may also be involved.  
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
No information provided and probably not applicable for a RLT product. 
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
177Lu-PSMA-617 is metabolically stable both in vitro and in vivo, passively cleared through the kidneys 
and not a substrate of any of the investigated uptake or efflux transporters (i.e. MATE1, MATE2-K, 
OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, P-gp and BCRP) based on in vitro assessments. Therefore, it is unlikely to become 
subject to any metabolic- or transporter-mediated drug interactions. Similarly, 177Lu-PSMA-617 was 
not an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 and was also not an inhibitor of all common CYPs (CYP1A2, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4/5), and investigated efflux and uptake transporters. Therefore, 177Lu-
PSMA-617 will not be the cause of any CYP- or transporter-mediated drug interactions. The safety and 
efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 have not been established in females as 177Lu-PSMA-617 is not indicated 
for use in females; therefore, there are no available data on the use of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in pregnant or 
lactating women.  
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs was relatively rare and balanced in the pivotal trial PSMA-617-
01. Permanent discontinuation of BSC/BSoC due to TEAEs was only slightly less frequent than in the 
177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC treatment arm (45, 8.5% patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC 
arm vs. 16, 7.8% patients in the BSC/BSoC only arm). The most frequent TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 were myelosuppression related events (5.1%). 2.8% 
patients each with thrombocytopenia and anemia; 1.3% patients with leukopenia; 0.8% patients with 
neutropenia, and 0.6% patients with pancytopenia) probably reflecting the impact of radiation, while 
symptoms associated with disease progression (particularly spinal cord compression) were the main 
cause for TEAE related discontinuation in the BSC/BSoC only arm.

2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan containing 177Lu-PSMA-617 has not received marketing 
authorization in any country. No commercially available 177Lu-PSMA product is currently 
approved in the EU. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main safety evaluation was based on safety data from a single pivotal study, PSMA-617-01 which 
is a phase III, open-label, randomized study in patients with progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC. 
Supportive safety data are derived from the phase 2 study PSMA-617-02 using a different dose 
regimen (6.0 GBq or 7.4 GBq, every 8 weeks for 4 cycles). Also, ECG data from a single arm sub-study 
(N=30) which recruited the same patients as the pivotal study was provided. The safety reporting was 
done in patients in the FAS who received at least 1 dose of randomized therapy (FAS safety analysis 
set). Considering the replication of results by the supportive study, safety data derived from a single 
pivotal study is considered acceptable. However, it cannot be excluded that the open-label design of 
the pivotal study may have affected safety reporting.  
Pooling of safety data across these studies was not possible, since both trials differ regarding the study 
design, the treatment regimen used and the approach for safety data collection. Mainly the fact that 
AESI categories had not been defined while these data were analyzed and only SAEs were graded 
using CTCAE, limit the supportive value of data from Study PSMA-617-02. Moreover, trial PSMA-617-
02 was small and early terminated due to acquisition of PSMA-617 by a different company, who 
initiated the pivotal trial PSMA-617-01. Thus, the main relevant source for safety assessment in this 
application remains trial PSMA-617-01. However, data from trial PSMA-617-02 may allow to some 
degree assessing dose-depending toxicities of 177Lu-PSMA-617. 
It is important to note that the safety profile derived from this study is not from 177Lu-PSMA-617 given 
as monotherapy, because concomitant anti-cancer medications were allowed during the study, such as 
GNRH agonists/antagonists, anti-androgens and novel androgen axis drugs. The latter are considered 
to be more relevant for the observed safety profile and were received by 52.6% of the patients in the 
177Lu-PSMA-617 arm and 67.8% of the patients in the BSC arm. The use of these medications in this 
setting is considered acceptable, since this is reflective of clinical practice, and reflected in the finally 
agreed indication (see also clinical efficacy section). The imbalance in anti-androgens may have slightly 
favoured the safety profile for the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm compared with the control arm.  
Safety assessments consisted of AEs, laboratory data, and vital signs, which is deemed sufficient for 
evaluation in this application. Moreover, in general the provided documents are adequately structured 
and informative to allow a valid assessment. 
Non-clinical data revealed the almost complete absence of intrinsic toxicity of non-radioactive 
(unlabelled) PSMA-617. This means that adverse events and safety profile of the applied product is 
dominated from radiation effects in target cells as well as off-target organs.  
Dosimetry demonstrated that cell salivary glands, renal tubular cells, and small intestine tissues 
express PSMA; however, expression is restricted and several hundred-fold lower. Nevertheless, 
symptoms of toxicities in these organs are likely to be drug-related and are defined as adverse events 
of special interest (AESI). 
As per data from dosimetry studies, the largest radiation absorbed dose is in the lacrimal glands. 
However, only low frequency and low-grade AEs of dry eye are reported in the literature. In the other 
EMA/871459/2022

side, it remains uncertain whether this issue was sufficiently evaluated in other published trials. With 
respect to the cumulative radiation-dose, literature data suggest that a 177Lu-PSMA-617 total 
cumulative dose 50 GBq could be administered without long-term salivary gland toxicity (Virgolini et al 
2018). 
The kidney, as the primary route of 177Lu-PSMA-617 excretion and a PSMA-expressing tissue, is 
exposed to 177Lu-PSMA-617; however, nephrotoxicity has not been notable in any safety series before. 
In the Hofman prospective Phase II LuPSMA study, grade 1-2 renal injury are reported in 10% of 
patients and a mean decline of 51Cr-EDTA eGFR of 11.7 mL/min (95% CI -19 to -4 mL/min) was 
observed in 28 patients who had 51Cr-EDTA eGFR measured before and 3 months after completion of 
177Lu-PSMA-617 (Violet et al 2020). Scarpa et al (2017) noted these results and reasoned that a 
biologically effective dose for 177Lu-PSMA-617 could be as high as 61.66+/-35.97 GBq. However, 
though available published literature data do not show renal toxicity to be an important safety concern 
during treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617, it needs to be considered that due to the possibility of 
radiotoxic damage to this exposed tissue, renal toxicity may still present a risk in months to years 
following treatment also for 177-Lu-PSMA. In particular, if a high dose regime was administered like in 
the pivotal trial. However, considering the overall low life expectance of an advanced mPC population, 
the importance of renal toxicity may be probably rather limited. According to the trials 
inclusion/exclusion criteria it was agreed that Pluvicto should not be used in patients with moderate 
renal impairment, specifically within the range of CLcr 30 to < 50 mL/min as well as in patients with 
severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), while treatment in patients with moderate renal 
impairment within the range of CLcr ≥ 50 to 59 mL/min is acceptable(see SmPC section 4.2). Use in 
“patients with severe renal impairment” is included as missing information in the RMP (see section 
2.7.1). 
More clarification regarding the impact of renal impairment can be expected from the planned trial 
Study CAAA617A12202, which was a requirement for approval by FDA.  
Although in the non-diseased bone marrow a lack of PSMA expression was demonstrated and published 
dosimetry studies with 177Lu-PSMA-617 highlight that the average bone marrow absorbed radiation 
doses are low, it needs to be considered that higher burden of metastatic disease in the bone marrow 
may increase radiation exposure in the bone marrow. Moreover, prior therapies in the applied mCRPC 
population with cytotoxic drugs and PSMA negative PC bone-marrow infiltration may reduce the normal 
capacity of bone marrow function in addition. Literature data report that radiation absorbed dose limits 
have been defined for EBRT induced haematological damage at 2 Gy, while radiobiological estimation 
calculate a tolerable 177Lu-PSMA-617 cumulative dose for bone marrow of 45 to 73 GBq (Kabasakal et 
al 2017, Scarpa et al 2017). 
Summarising the known safety observations as documented in the publish literature following 177Lu-
PSMA-617 treatment the drug’s known toxicities to date appear to be predominantly grade 1/2, 
reversible, and most frequently seen as salivary gland, haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity. 
The incidence of grade 3/4 toxicities is low, and mainly restricted to reversible haematological events. 
Frequent hematologic toxicities or myelosuppression related events noted are anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia and neutropenia, which may be due to significant bone marrow 
impairment at baseline. Well described off-target toxicities are dry mouth, which is reported as 
reversible grade 1/2, with no reports of >grade 2 dry mouth in the literature, while reversible grade 
1/2 dry eyes have been reported much less frequently. Interestingly, nephrotoxicity was not been 
notable in any of the published safety series. The most frequent non-haematological toxicities 
associated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment are reported to be nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, decreased

appetite, pain and fatigue. These are seen as non-specific, but are likely to be attributed to the 
administration of therapeutic levels of a radioactive compound. 
With respect this application, it is important to understand that the current posology, which 
recommends treatment regimen for 177Lu-PSMA-617 for a total of 6 cycles (doses) of 7.4 GBq 
administered intravenously every 6 weeks (± 1 week) is a significant dose escalation compared with 
the previous experience, including a high dose, more intensive treatment with shorter recovery periods 
and more cycles than previous experience. Although it is acknowledged that the trial was successful, 
data revealed that the radiation-related off-target toxicity was obviously significantly higher than in 
other trials. Although it is acknowledged that the significant difference in treatment duration between 
the two arms may have contributed also and biased the outcome significantly in favour for subjects 
BSC/BSoC, the uncertainty that there may be a potential for ameliorated tolerability at a lower dose 
level remains.   
Exposure 
Overall, N=593 patients were exposed to 177Lu-PSMA-617, N=529 patients in the pivotal study and 
N=64 in supportive study. The median follow up for the safety analysis set was 14.13 months (range: 
0.6-31.5). Around N=88 patients (16.6%) received treatment for at least 1 year in the experimental 
arm. A small number of patients received treatment longer than 1 year. While these samples are 
small, this is considered sufficient to establish the safety profile. 
The longer median duration of exposure in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm (7.8 months) compared with the 
control arm (2.1 months) could be reflective of better efficacy considering that most patients 
discontinued treatment due to disease progression (23.0% versus 26.1%). In the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm 
46.5% of the patients had received 6 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 and 67.7% patients received at least 4 
cycles. The decision whether full 6 cycles should be given in the trial depended on the investigators 
decision based an individual benefit-risk assessment and is acceptable since it may reflect the clinical 
practise.  
Cycles were mostly delayed due to scheduling purposes (10.6%) and in 7.6% of the patients due to 
AEs. One dose reduction (by 20%) in administered activity was permitted and these were observed in 
5.7% of the patients, all due to AEs. These numbers could not be compared with the BSC arm due to 
the open label nature of the study. 
The SmPC recommended dose for 177Lu-PSMA-617 is 7 400 MBq (200 mCi) every 6 weeks (±1 week) 
for a total of 6 doses. This corresponds to an overall treatment duration of 9 months and a total 
radiation dose of about 44.400 MBq.  
The median and mean of duration of exposure is about 6.3 or 7.9 months only. Moreover, the details 
regarding the number of cycles in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm of the pivotal trial PSMA-617-
01 reveal that only 46.5% of the patients received the full recommended treatment of 6 cycles of 
177Lu-PSMA-617, while 67.7% received at least 4 cycles, the minimum recommended per protocol. This 
means that more than the half of the FAS Safety population was not exposed to the intended full 
treatment course of 6 cycles and the full dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 due to the investigator’s decision. 
However, as the rate of adverse events reported in the different cycles is balanced, this may be 
acceptable. 
In summary, it may be presumed that the safety profile characterised by the exposed population does 
not fully reflect the treatment risks and may lead to an underestimation of the toxicity in the case all 
subjects would have been exposed with 6 cycles of treatment.   
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 102/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
On the other side, it needs to be considered that since the majority of the patients in the BSC/BSoC 
only arm (97.6%) patients discontinued treatment early, exposure in the comparator arm was 
significantly lower [Mean 3.5 (3.9), Median 2.1 months], which clearly has biased the safety outcome 
in the BCS/BSoC only arm favourable. Considering the totality of data the proposed posology seems 
acceptable. 
Otherwise, it is agreed that the demographic and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced 
between the 2 treatment arms, and were representative of the mCRPC patients with an advanced 
disease. 
Adverse events 
As could be expected in a comparison to BSC/BSoC more pronounce safety risks were observed during 
177Lu-PSMA-617. Overall, all relevant key safety characteristics (TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs, grade ≥3 
events, as well as SAEs including fatal SAEs) were usually more frequent in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm.  
The higher rates of TEAEs and SAEs in general (PSMA:36.3% vs BSC: 27.8%) are may be caused by 
the disease, as illustrated by the significantly lower rates of drug-related SAES (PSMA: 9.3% vs BSC: 
2.9%). Considering the similar rates of investigator-assessed SAEs with a fatal outcome (PSMA:3.6% 
vs BSC:2.9%) higher incidences may also reflect the significantly shorter treatment duration in the 
BSC/BSoC arm . This means that the period for reporting adverse events was more than twofold longer 
in the  177Lu-PSMA-617 arm and thereby may have (partially) contributed significantly to the 
observed differences in TEAEs and SAEs.  
In the PSMA-617-01 study, the incidence of TEAEs by SOC (for all SOCs) was higher in the 177Lu-
PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm.  
The greatest differences (≥20%) between the 2 treatment arms (177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. 
BSC/BSoC only arm) were observed for gastrointestinal disorders (PSMA: 75.4% vs BSC: 31.7% of 
patients), general disorders and administration site conditions (PSMA: 61.2% vs BSC: 38.5% of 
patients) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (PSMA: 47.8% vs BSC: 18.0% of patients). 
Although grade ≥3 TEAEs in general were relatively infrequent (<5.0% in either arms), some 
differences are noted, in particular with respect to myelosuppression events as anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia), which were more frequent in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm. It is noted that these events were more frequent (in the range of 6-13% 
frequency), but only led to permanent discontinuation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in ≤3.0% of the patients.  
TEAEs with the greatest differences (≥10%) in the incidence between the 2 treatment arms (177Lu- 
PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. BSC/BSoC only arm) were observed regarding fatigue (PSMA: 43.1% 
vs. BSC:22.9%), anemia (PSMA: 31.8% vs. BSC 13.2%), thrombocytopenia (PSMA: 17.2% vs. 
BSC:4.4%) as well as lymphopenia (PSMA: 14.2% vs BSC: 3.9%) and leukopenia (PSMA:12.5% vs. 
BSC: 2.0%). Moreover, probably in the context of the decrease leucocytes urinary tract infection were 
also more frequent (PSMA: 11.0% vs BCS: 1.0% patients). 
Interestingly, spinal cord compression as a SSE was observed with a lower frequency in the 177Lu-
PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm (1.3% patients vs. 5.4% patients in the BSC/BSoC arm), which may be 
seen as a treatment associated benefit in principle. However, the small number of events and the 
difference in observational period does not allow a valid interpretation and may represent also a 
chance finding. 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 103/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
Hepatotoxicity events were also reported to be slightly with higher with a higher incidence (less than 
5% differences) in both arms (10.2% patients vs. 7.8% patients); and again only very few events led 
to withdrawal of 177Lu-PSMA-617 (0.6% patients). 
Second Primary Malignancies as consequence of the radiation were infrequent events in both arms 
(2.1% patients vs. 1.0% patient). The events were skin cancers and metastases to the brain or 
meninges.  When excluding metastatic events the following events were reported in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC treatment arm: squamous cell carcinoma (4 patients), basal cell carcinoma, malignant 
melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (1 patient each). However, one case of acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) was reported outside of the treatment-emergent period, after the 30-day post-
treatment follow-up, but before capture of long-term follow-up events. As in other RLTs before, the 
important risk for haematological malignancies like leukemia and MDS is not fully evaluable from the 
data submitted, but it is possible to estimate this risk from the type of radiation from other RLTs and 
the cumulative dose administered. Second Primary Malignancies are therefore considered to be class 
effect. Data on this second primary malignancies were reported in section 4.8 under the header of 
“Description of selected adverse reactions” as a class effect. Also since the incidence of second primary 
malignancies is considered relevant information for prescribers and patients. Second Primary 
Malignancies were included as important potential risk in the RMP. As in other RLT, mature data 
regarding this issue can be expected only from a longer follow up.  
In the PSMA-617-01 study, long-term follow-up safety data was collected after the end-of-study visit 
for a duration of 24 months or until 508 deaths (whichever occurred first). According the applicant’s 
reports the incidences of AEs by SOC were similar (≤10% differences) for those patients who had 
previously received 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC. All other events selected as potential safety topic of 
interests (QT Prolongation, Intracranial Hemorrhage, Reproductive Toxicity) were reported for <2.0% 
of patients in both arms, and withdrawal of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was attributed to such events in either 0 
or 1 patient (0.2%) in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm. 
In general, it is reassuming that no new or additional signals were identified and no obviously dramatic 
increase in toxicities was observed with the high dose posology on the first glance.  
The criteria for the first screening and identification of adverse drug reaction (ADR) candidates for 
reporting in the labelling was any AE (MedDRA PT) which occurred in ≥5% of patients treated with 
177Lu-PSMA-617 arm or with a difference of ≥2% compared with the BSC/BSoC control arm. AEs with 
reported frequencies of <5%, or additional AEs observed in other supporting studies and the literature, 
or additional data were also considered as ADR candidates based on clinical assessment of specificity, 
severity and plausibility. ADR candidates then underwent medical review to ascertain whether or not 
each should be considered as an ADR related to 177Lu-PSMA-617.  
SAEs 
Overall SAEs were reported more frequently in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm (36.3%) compared with the 
BSC arm (27.8%), however frequencies of individual SAEs were generally low (<2%) except for 
anaemia (2.8% vs 0.5%), urinary tract infection (2.5 vs 0.5%), haematuria (2.1% vs 0.5%) and spinal 
cord compression (1.1% vs 4.9%). As stated before, this is indicative of more severe toxicity of 177Lu-
PSMA-617 plus BSC compared with BSC alone, apart from the difference in spinal cord compression 
that could be efficacy-related. 
Deaths 
Overall, 85 patients died while on treatment: 66 (12.5%) patients in the 177Lu PSMA 617 arm, and 19 
(9.3%) patients in the BSC arm. The most frequent cause of death was disease progression in both 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 104/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
arms (respectively 8.3% vs. 6.8%). Further, three (0.6%) patients died of unknown causes in the 
177Lu PSMA 617 arm, while there were no unknown death causes in the BSC arm. Deaths due to 
TEAEs (not including the deaths due to disease progression erroneously collected in this category prior 
to a protocol amendment which corrected this) were observed in 18 (3.4%) patients in the 177Lu-
PSMA-617 arm (including 1 case of COVID 19); and 4 (2.0%) patients in the BSC arm. Three on-
treatment deaths were reported by the investigator to be related to 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment 
(versus none in the control arm): two patients died due to pancytopenia, and 1 death due to bone 
marrow failure, all three a consequence of the myelosuppression caused by177Lu-PSMA-617 
treatment. In addition, it is noted that in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm, but not in the control arm, there 
are several deaths not considered related to treatment. However, the deaths by intracranial 
haemorrhage were considered possibly or definitively related by the investigator, it is supported that 
Intracranial haemorrhage, is proposed by the Applicant as an important potential risk in the RMP. In 
addition, routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond ADRs reporting and signal detection included 
specific adverse event follow-up checklists, which will be used to collect further data to help 
characterize and/or closely monitor the respective risk. 
Laboratory findings 
Beside the haematological TEAE discussed above, clinical chemistry abnormalities observed during 
randomized treatment were generally similar in both treatment arms (≤10% differences) with few 
noteworthy exceptions of hyponatremia (38.2% patients vs. 24.9% patients); hypocalcemia (43.1% 
patients vs. 31.7% patients); and AST increased (31.2% patients vs. 21.0% patients). In both 
treatment arms, grade 3 / 4 abnormalities were infrequent (<3.0% patients). 
The impact of the underlying disease itself as well as the cytotoxic pre-treatment seems to be reflected 
also by the observation that many patients had already low grade hematology abnormalities (grade 1 
or 2) at baseline in both the treatment arms and for all hematology parameters analyzed. However, 
such observations are not unusual in cancer trials at baseline.   
The liver function parameters were similar in both arms, and no notable high frequency was observed 
for any of the hepatic laboratory categories. The laboratory data did not raise any hepatic safety 
concerns. No patient in either arm had a constellation of values indicative of Hy's law during the 
randomized treatment. Also during long term follow-up, liver function parameters were similar 
between both the groups of patients and similar to what was observed during the randomized 
treatment. 
Vital signs 
The non-clinical data do not appear to indicate an effect of 177Lu PSMA-617 on the cardiac 
electrophysiology, however no dedicated clinical QT/QTc study was performed and ECGs were not 
automatically collected during the PSMA-617-01 study, only one ECG at screening was performed. The 
Applicant, however, did perform a single arm sub study in 30 patients at sites in Germany. This is 
considered to be a suboptimal situation as a QT/QTc study should ideally be performed prior to the 
phase 3 study as systematic monitoring might be needed in the phase 3 trial. 
Safety topics of interest 
The Applicant defined safety topics of interest which included AESIs for 177Lu-PSMA-617 as well as 
other safety topics considered standard for a comprehensive safety review. Most of these events 
occurred more frequent in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm compared with the control arm. The following 
events were defined to be of interest; fatigue (49.1% vs. 29.3%), myelosuppression (47.4% vs. 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 105/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
17.6%), dry mouth (39.3% vs. 1.0%), nausea and vomiting (39.3% vs 17.1%), hepatotoxicity (10.2% 
vs 7.8%), renal effects (8.7% vs 5.9%) and second primary malignancies (N=11 [2.1%] vs N=2 
[1.0%]) . Intracranial haemorrhage (1.3% vs 1.5%) and reproductive toxicity (0.2% vs 0%) were 
observed at more or less comparable rates compared with the control arm. Grade ≤3 AEs were not 
observed frequently with the exception of myelosuppression events (23.4% vs 6.8%) and fatigue 
(7.0% vs 2.4%). Most of the safety events were treatment related, but did not lead to large tolerability 
issues (i.e. discontinuations and dose reductions/interruptions), except for myelosuppression events. It 
is not known whether the treatment-emergent AEs related to the safety topics of interest resolved over 
time as these data were not collected by the Applicant. Collection and submissioin of data on risks of 
myelosuppression, renal failure, xerostomia and xerophthalmia and their complications, and potential 
of secondary malignancies. have been  recommended (PAM-REC). 
According to dosimetry data collected in the single arm sub-study the lacrimal glands (92 mGy), 
salivary glands (28 mGy), left colon (26 mGy), rectum (25 mGy), kidneys (19 mGy), right colon (14 
mGy), urinary bladder (14 mGy) and thyroid (11 mGy) absorb the highest doses.  
Myelosuppression events led to (at least one event of) dose interruption in roughly 20%, dose 
reduction in 8% and discontinuation in 15% of the patients, while tolerability issues were barely seen 
in the control arm. As previously stated there were 3 treatment related deaths due to 
myelosuppression events. Myelosuppression events are reported in section 4.4 and section 4.8 of the 
SmPC, and treatment recommendations in section 4.2, which is considered acceptable. 
Myelosuppression is considered important identified risk (RMP). 
From the 39.3% (vs. 1.0%) of patients with dry mouth in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm, there were no 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs of dry mouth observed.  
High grade (≥ 3) nausea and vomiting events were infrequent in both arms (1.5% vs. 0.5%). In the 
protocol, prophylactic therapy and antiemetic treatment were recommended at the discretion of the 
investigator. Considering that all these options are well established as clinical standards no additional 
recommendation regarding this issues are needed in the product information in the Rapporteur's view.   
No events of QT prolongation were observed, however ECGs were not made systematically and no 
dedicated QT/QTc study was performed. Thus, it remains uncertain whether 177Lu-PSMA-617 does not 
influence the QT interval. Although no preclinical safety concerns were raised with regard to QT 
prolongation, the clinical data do not provide sufficient reassurance that 177Lu-PSMA-617 does not 
influence the QT interval; in the PK-ECG sub-study the concentration-QTc model predicts mean QTcF 
increase with an upper CI >10ms at Tmax, there were more events related to QT prolongation in the 
177Lu-PSMA-617 compared to the BSC arm and there was no systematic ECG monitoring during the 
pivotal study. The Applicant was recommended to perform a QTc (sub)study as part of post 
authorisation Study CAAA617A12202, and provide the results of this (sub)study in order to conclude 
whether 177Lu-PSMA-617 leads to QTc effects.  
From the data provided by the Applicant, ocular events do not appear to occur more frequently in 
patients with an AE of dry eye in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC treatment arm. It can be considered 
acceptable that the occurrence of dry eye is used as a proxy for lacrimal toxicity here. However, it is 
noted that ocular events are observed more frequently in patients who received a cumulative dose 
over 14.8 GBq compared to below and equal to 14.8 GBq. This is also in accordance with published 
literature data were the frequency of dry exe TEAEs was about ~10% lower than in the pivotal trial 
Though the effect of time on treatment (and thus time to develop an AE) may have also influenced 
these outcomes. Overall, it can be agreed that no labeling changes are proposed related to the eye 
disorders SOC in Table 2 of the EU SmPC within section 4.8.

Safety in special populations 
Many subgroup analyses for safety were performed. Subgroup analyses in the LuPSMA617+BSC arm 
by age (<65 [N=142]; ≥65-<75 [N=244]; ≥75 [N=143] years at baseline) indicate no large 
differences in safety between the different age categories in the experimental arm. 
As typical for the mCRPC population, the majority of the patient population in Study PSMA-617-01 was 
elderly (≥ 65 years), with only about one quarter of patients being below the age of 65 years at 
baseline. This is consistent with the median age at diagnosis of mCRPC being 70 years (Flaig et al 
2016).  
There was a trend of more TEAEs and more severe TEAEs with increasing patient age in both the 
177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm and in the BSC/BSoC only arm; however, this trend was not of 
specific concern in the eldest category of patients (≥75 years) and differences were mostly ≤10%, 
with few exceptions. In general, treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 did not appear to a significant 
increase regarding the differences in the incidence of TEAEs between the age groups when compared 
with the differences in the incidence of TEAEs between the age groups seen in the BSC/BSoC only arm. 
This is reassuring considering the different medians of treatment durations in the both arms. 
Moreover, a tendency towards higher incidences and severity was observed in patients with ECOG 
score of 2 at baseline versus ECOG score 0 or 1, in patients ≥65 years, patients with abnormal eGFR 
and proteinuria levels, renal impairment, and patients with concurrent radiation therapy in both the 
treatment arms. 
Patients with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min were not allowed to be included in the study. There is 
few information on patients with renal and hepatic impairment. The Applicant compared patients with 
baseline renal impairment via medical history (yes/no). There were few patients with renal impairment 
in the medical history (N=11 in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm vs N=2 in the control arm). In the 177Lu-
PSMA-617 arm, patients with renal impairment had a less favourable safety profile compared to 
patients without renal impairment in their history, exemplified by higher frequencies of severe AEs 
(81.8% vs 52.1%), SAEs (63.6% vs 35.7%) and discontinuations (18.2% vs 11.8%). The number of 
patients in the control arm with renal impairment was too small for comparison. (Refer to the 
discussion on clinical pharmacokinetics for labelling consequences for patients with renal impairment.)  
Patients with ALT or AST >3.0 ×ULN or >5.0 × ULN for patients with liver metastases were not allowed 
to be included in the pivotal study. There were no patients with hepatic impairment at baseline and 
thus there were no safety analyses for patients with hepatic impairment. (Refer to the discussion on 
clinical pharmacokinetics for labelling consequences for patients with hepatic impairment.) 
Overall, no other clinically relevant trend or pattern was observed from the subgroup analyses 
presented. Considering the partially low numbers in the subgroups meaningful interpretation of 
changes observed seemed challenging and less reliable; chance findings may be also be involved. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions 
No clinical drug-drug interaction studies were performed by the Applicant. 177Lu-PSMA-617 is 
metabolically stable both in vitro and in vivo, passively cleared through the kidneys and not a 
substrate of any of the investigated uptake or efflux transporters (i.e. MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT2, P-gp and BCRP) based on in vitro assessments. Therefore, it is unlikely to become subject to 
any metabolic- or transporter-mediated drug interactions.  
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 107/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
Similarly, 177Lu-PSMA-617 was not an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 and was also not an inhibitor of 
all common CYPs (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4/5), and investigated efflux and uptake 
transporters. Therefore, 177Lu-PSMA-617 will not be the cause of any CYP- or transporter-mediated 
drug interactions. It is concluded that drug-drug interactions due to 177Lu-PSMA-617 are not a concern. 
No other additional interactions have to be discussed. 
Discontinuation due to safety events 
Discontinuation due to TEAEs was higher in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment compared with BSC/BSoC, 
but in total low. The most frequent TEAEs leading to 177Lu-PSMA-617 discontinuation were 
mylosuppression related events (2.8% patients each with thrombocytopenia and anemia; 1.3% 
patients with leukopenia; 0.8% patients with neutropenia, and 0.6% patients with pancytopenia). All 
other TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 were reported in ≤0.5% of 
patients each.  
The most frequent TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of BSC/BSoC in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm were anemia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia (0.9% patients each), which were all 
also observed in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm. 
The safety risks due to treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm were not identified as an 
important risk for treatment discontinuation. 
No additional safety signal was derived from the supportive data from Study PSMA-617-02 and no 
further discussion of this data is deemed meaningful. 
Supportive study 
In the supportive study PSMA-617-02, similar types of AEs were observed as reported for the pivotal 
study, albeit that frequencies of severe (14.1%) and serious (18.8%) TEAEs and TEAEs leading to dose 
reduction (3.1%) and discontinuation (1.6%) were much lower. There was only one patient with a 
severe AE related to myelosuppression (one case of thrombocytopenia [1.6%]). This may be due to a 
different dosing schedule (6.0 GBq or 7.4 GBq, every 8 weeks for 4 doses in the supportive study 
versus 7.4 GBq every 6 weeks for 6 doses in the pivotal study). This questions whether there may be a 
potential for ameliorated tolerability at a lower dose level. The tolerability and severity of AEs may thus 
be improved with a lower dose however, it is unknown this would maintain similar clinical benefit.  
Remaining safety topics 
Considering the nature of the product it is acceptable that ADA’s were not analysed. No cases of 
overdose with 177Lu PSMA-617 have been reported in the 2 prospective clinical studies PSMA-617-01 
and PSMA-617-02. The Applicant considers that the possibility of an overdose of 177Lu PSMA-617 is 
unlikely, as a single dose vial with the predefined amount of radioactivity (7.4 GBq [±0.10]) is used 
and is administered by specific healthcare providers. This can be agreed. 
Inadvertent radiation exposure has been included as important potential risk in the RMP. Educational 
materials for patients and their relatives were deemed necessary to address this risk (see RMP). 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Adding 177Lu-PSMA-617 to BSC leads to a more unfavourable safety profile compared with BSC alone. 
This is exemplified by the higher numbers of all-causality and treatment-related AEs, severe AEs, 
SAEs, and treatment-related deaths. The largest differences in AEs between the two treatment arms 
are observed in the SOCs Gastrointestinal disorders (AEs: dry mouth, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 108/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
constipation), General disorders (AE: fatigue) and Blood and lymphatic system disorders (AEs: 
anaemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and leukopenia). Noteworthy are the AEs of 
myelosuppression which are mostly treatment-related and the main causes of severe AEs, SAEs, 
treatment-related deaths, and tolerability issues.  
A bias to the disadvantage of 177-Lu-PSMA-617 may be a potential reason for the imbalances in 
exposure, due to a significantly shorter exposure in the BSC/BSoC arm. More than the half of the FAS 
Safety population included in this assessment was not exposed to the planned treatment course of 6 
cycles and the intended full dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 due to the investigator’s decision. Thus, the safety 
profile presented may not fully reflect the treatment risks of the applied posology. An underestimation 
of the toxicity may even be presumed also, since frequency and particularly severity of AESI are likely 
to depend from the total dose administered and may increase during longer treatment. 
Overall, although the safety aspects were sufficiently covered, the safety profile of 177Lu-PSMA-617 is 
considered non-negligible and should be weighed against the efficacy. For each patient, the radiation 
exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit (see SmPC 4.4).

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 1.2 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 23.03.2022. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Pluvicto (lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 
1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Pluvicto in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with or without androgen receptor 
(AR) pathway inhibition is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive prostate-
specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
who have been treated with AR pathway inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy (see section 5.1). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current clinical guidelines (2021 EAU; and 2020 ESMO guidelines on prostate cancer) recommend the 
following (approved) medicinal products for the treatment of mCRPC, basing the choice of treatment 
on the patient’s performance status, symptoms, co-morbidities, location and extent of disease, 
genomic profile, preference, and on the previously received treatment(s) in the (still) hormone-
sensitive disease setting (in alphabetical order): abiraterone, cabazitaxel, docetaxel, enzalutamide, 
olaparib, 223Ra-dichloride). 
Regarding the unmet medical need, on the one hand it is noted that approved treatments exist for 
(at least) part of the target population. On the other hand, few therapeutic options exist for patients 
with mCRPC who have previously received a NAAD as well as taxane-based chemotherapy (i.e. either 
docetaxel, or both docetaxel and cabazitaxel), and there thus remains an unmet medical need for 
(effective) new treatment options. 
177Lu-PSMA-617 has been used experimentally in the clinic since 2013 for the treatment of patients 
with mCRPC (Ahmadzadehfar et al 2015). As a result, published data on efficacy (and safety) of 177Lu-
PSMA-617 in patients with mCRPC is available from many centers. Moreover, PSMA ligand, can be also

extent of disease by PET imaging. Therefore, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging is used as a component of 
68 (68Ga) and used to identify PSMA expression and determine the local 
eligibility criteria. 
‐
While the efficacy results from the retrospective studies are encouraging, the data from the 
prospective studies are important as these studies involved well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
careful patient selection via 68Ga-PSMA-11 and FDG PET/CT imaging, and prespecified data collection 
and analysis (Emmett et al 2019, Violet et al 2020, Hofman et al 2021).  
177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment option is already recommended in the updated European treatment 
guidelines for the applied mCRPC population. However, no commercially available 177Lu-PSMA-617 
product is currently approved in the EU in a centralized procedure. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The Pivotal Study PSMA-617-01 (VISION) is an international, prospective, open-label, multicenter, 
randomized Phase III study of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC 
who were previously treated with 1-2 taxane-based chemotherapy regimens and at least 1 AR pathway 
inhibitor and who had a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan that determined them eligible for inclusion. 
Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 7.4 GBq (± 10%) 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus 
BSC/BSoC or to receive BSC/BSoC only. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At the 27-Jan-2021 DCO with a median follow-up time for OS of ~20 months, both alternate primary 
efficacy objectives in the VISION study of rPFS and OS were met and their analyses are thus to be 
regarded as final. 
In the PFS-FAS (see below), treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 showed a statistically significant 
improvement in rPFS compared with BSC/BSoC: HR = 0.40 (99.2% CI: 0.29, 0.57); p < 0.001; 
median rPFS 8.7 months (99.2% CI: 7.9; 10.8) vs. 3.4 months (99.2% CI: 2.4; 4.0).All performed 
sensitivity/supportive analyses for rPFS (including a sensitivity analysis in line with EMA guidance 
[EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1]) support the rPFS primary analysis. Plus, subgroup analyses for rPFS 
were consistent with the primary rPFS analysis and demonstrated consistency of the treatment effect 
across clinically relevant subgroups. 
In the FAS (see below), treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 showed a statistically significant improvement 
in OS compared with BSC/BSoC: HR = 0.62 (95% CI: 0.52; 0.74); p < 0.001; median OS 15.3 
months (95% CI: 14.2; 16.9) vs. 11.3 months (95% CI: 9.8; 13.5).All performed 
sensitivity/supportive analyses for OS support the OS primary analysis. Plus, subgroup analyses for OS 
were consistent with the primary OS analysis and demonstrated consistency of the treatment effect 
across clinically relevant subgroups. 
Also for the key secondary endpoints, i.e. ORR, DCR and SSE, treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 
showed a statistically significant improvement compared with BSC/BSoC, see results in below Effects 
Table.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Considering the lower recurrence rate of the PROs-Questionnaires and the open design, the reliability 
of the reported PRO results in favor of treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC relative to 
BSC/BSoC is seen as low. In summary, it cannot be excluded that a positive effect on QoL is seen in 
177Lu-PSMA-617 treated patients, who well respond on the treatment, but not more. 
Homogeneity and consistency of the alternate primary endpoints rPFS and OS was not demonstrated 
across subgroups of Asians, African Americans or Blacks, and baseline PSADT >9 months due to too 
few patients included. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In comparison to BSC/BSoC, 177Lu-PSMA-617 on top of BSC/BSoC treatment leads to more and 
pronounced safety risks. Overall, all relevant key safety characteristics (TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs, 
grade ≥3 events, as well as SAEs including fatal SAEs) occurred more frequent in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm. However, at least partially this effect is caused by the significantly shorter 
observation periode in the BSC/BSoC arm due to the higher drop-out rate in in the BSC/BSoC only 
arm. The resulting imbalance in treatment duration has biased the pivotal trial PSMA-617-01, but in 
disadvantage for 177Lu-PSMA 617. 
The higher rates of TEAEs and SAEs in general (PSMA:36.3% vs BSC: 27.8%) are probably mainly 
caused by the disease, as illustrated by the significantly lower rates of drug-related SAEs (PSMA: 9.3% 
vs BSC: 2.4%). Nevertheless, the higher overall SAE rate may at least partially reflect the additional 
toxicity associated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment. However, the longer duration of exposure to 
randomized treatment in the PSMA arm may have resulted in a bias which disadvantages 177Lu-PSMA-
617 also. 
Grade ≥ 3 AEs were mainly restricted to hematological events, more adverse events were observed in 
patients receiving 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC (52.7%) vs. 38.0% of patients receiving BSC/BSoC 
only; however, the incidence of each individual grade ≥ 3 AE was low. 
While 85 patients died while on-treatment (PSMA: 12.5% vs BSC: 9.3%) mostly due to disease 
progression (PSMA: 8.3% vs BSC: 6.8%). However, three deaths were reported to be related to study 
treatment by the Investigator: 2 deaths due to pancytopenia and 1 death due to bone marrow failure, 
all in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm only. In a trial with a comparison with BSC/BSoC this may 
be expected, but may indicate also a higher risk due to the additional treatment. 
In total, 5.7% of the patients had TEAEs that led to dose reduction in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm and 
11.9% of the patients discontinued 177Lu-PSMA-617 due to TEAEs. The most frequent TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 were related to myelosuppression. 
The greatest differences (≥20%) between the 2 treatment arms (177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm vs. 
BSC/BSoC only arm) were observed for gastrointestinal disorders (PSMA: 75.4% vs BSC: 31.7% of 
patients), general disorders and administration site conditions (PSMA: 61.2% vs BSC: 38.5% of 
patients) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (PSMA: 47.8% vs BSC: 18.0% of patients).  
Moreover, probably in the context of the decrease leucocytes urinary tract infection were also more 
frequent (PSMA: 11.0% vs BCS: 1.0% patients). 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 114/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) for 177Lu-PSMA-617 were Fatigue (49.1% patients vs. 29.3% 
patients), Myelosuppression (47.4% patients vs. 17.6% patients), Dry Mouth (39.3% patients vs. 
1.0% patients), Nausea and Vomiting (39.3% patients vs. 17.1% patients). These AESI are caused by 
the active anti-cancer treatment and are related to the known mechanism of action of 177Lu-PSMA-
617.  
Drug-related TEAEs (as assessed by the Investigator) were clearly more frequent in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm (85.3% patients) as compared to the BSC/BSoC only arm (28.8% patients) as 
could be expected. The high grade (≥3) events were reported with highest incidence in this arm for 
anemia (9.6% patients), thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia (6.8% each). 
Dry mouth, fatigue and nausea, that were the most reported drug-related events in this arm, were 
usually low grade (≤2) in severity. 
Myelosuppression: based on the sensitivity of the bone marrow to radiation effects, this is considered a 
known risk for 177Lu-PSMA-617. Data from the PSMA-617-01 sub-study showed that the mean 
absorbed radiation dose for 177Lu-PSMA-617 in the red marrow was 0.035±0.020 Gy/GBq. As could 
be expected the frequency of myelosuppression-related events (including anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
lymphocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia) was consistently higher in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm (47.4% of patients) compared with the BSC/BSoC only arm (17.6% of patients). 
The most frequent myelosuppression-related adverse events were anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
lymphocytopenia, leukopenia and neutropenia, but were considered manageable with standard clinical 
interventions. 
Renal toxicity is also increased due to PSMA expression in the proximal tubule and the known renal 
route of 177Lu-PSMA-617 excretion and considered a known risk for 177Lu-PSMA-617. Data from the 
PSMA-617-01 sub-study showed that the mean radiation absorbed dose for the kidneys was 0.43 ± 
0.16 Gy/GBq. However, renal events in general were observed slightly more frequent with 8.7% of 
patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm than in the BSC/BSoC only arm (5.9%). However, 
the differences between renally impaired versus non-impaired groups were greater for high grade 
TEAEs (77.4% patients vs. 50.5% patients), and serious TEAEs (67.7% patients vs. 32.9% patients). 
Similar difference (50.0% patients vs. 26.4% patients) was noted in the BSC/BSoC only arm for the 
serious TEAEs. Moreover, the incidence of fatal TEAEs, though low in number overall, was 4 times 
more in the impaired group as compared with the non-impaired (12.9% patients vs. 3.0% patients) in 
the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm and more than 2 times in the impaired group as compared with 
the non-impaired in the BSC/BSoC only treatment arm (7.1% patients vs. 2.7% patients). Therefore, 
subjects with a moderate renal impairment (CLcr <50 mL/min) may bear an inherent risk of increase 
in AEs and treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 is not recommended in these patients.  
In 177Lu-PSMA-617 patients, renal toxicity was predominantly low-grade comprising creatinine 
increases that were manageable and reversible. Nevertheless, also grade ≥3 events occurred.  
Hepatotoxicity was reported slightly higher for 177-Lu-PSMA (PSMA: 10.2% vs. BSC: 7.8%), however, 
very few events led to withdrawal from 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC (0.6% patients). 
Non-hematological TEAEs: Similarly, although the TEAEs such as dry mouth (38.8% vs 0.5%), nausea 
(35.3% vs 16.6%), diarrhea (18.9% vs 2.9%), vomiting (18.9 vs 6.3%) and urinary tract infections 
(11% vs 1%) were also more frequent in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm; however, they were 
usually low grade (≤2) in severity; and they only led to permanent discontinuation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 
in ≤0.5% of patients. Moreover, the underlying disease or concomitant treatment with opioids may 
also have contributed this type of adverse events. 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 115/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
Despite the high apparent radiation exposure, incidences of lacrimal toxicities, i.e. dry eye and 
blurred vision were infrequent and were mostly low grade (grade 1-2) in the PSMA-617-01 study. 
Two (0.4%) patients in the 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC arm had high grade (≥3) events of blurred 
vision. 
Second Primary Malignancies as consequence of the radiation were infrequent events in both arms 
(2.1% patients vs. 1.0% patient). The events were skin cancers and metastases to the brain or 
meninges. However, one case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was reported outside of the treatment-
emergent period, after the 30-day post-treatment follow-up, but before capture of long-term follow-up 
events. 
In total, 5.7% of the patients had TEAEs that led to dose reduction in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm and 
11.9% of the patients discontinued 177Lu-PSMA-617 due to TEAEs. The most frequent TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 were related to myelosuppression. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety profile derived from the pivotal study is not from 177Lu-PSMA-617 given as monotherapy. 
The open-label design of the pivotal study may have affected safety reporting. 
Many of the more frequently reported adverse events are often observed in this patient population and 
may be related to the underlying disease and/or other comorbidities. Thus, identification of drug-
related adverse events needs to consider the off-target tissues for 177Lu-PSMA-617 mainly, but 
causality for other events remains difficult to assess at the end. 
The impact of the significantly shorter treatment exposure (Median PSMA: 7.8 months vs BSC: 2.1 
months) in the BSC/BSoC arm in comparison to treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 on top of BSC/BSoC 
arm for safety regarding the higher frequency and grading of adverse events was probably relevant. 
However, since the time in which TEAEs were registered was significantly longer, event rates are 
clearly skewed in disadvantage for 177-Lu-PSMA. In general, this seems to be confirmed by the 
reported exposure-adjusted adverse event rates that were submitted.  
The imbalance of drug-related AEs, as assessed by the Investigator, needs to be interpreted with 
caution as the study was open-label. Moreover, patients were already receiving BSC/BSoC before 
randomization and standard of care might have not been systematically considered as Study Drug by 
some Investigators. 
The uncertainty that there may be a potential for ameliorated tolerability at a lower dose level remains. 
However, it is unknown whether this would maintain similar clinical benefit. 
Myelosuppression events in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm occurred frequently and these events have a 
large impact on the toxicity, tolerability and on treatment-related deaths. It is unclear whether risk 
minimalization measures were taken/were effective on this subject.  
Based on the available data/modelling from the ECG sub-study a QT prolongation above 10 ms cannot 
be excluded and in this situation additional evaluation by ECG and PK samples in clinical studies would 
have been needed, however such data has not been collected. There were no patients observed to 
have had Torsade de pointes. It remains uncertain that 177Lu-PSMA-617 does not influence the QT 
interval. The Applicant was recommended to perform a QTc (sub)study as part of post-authorisation 
Study CAAA617A12202.

The risk of haematological malignancies particularly for leukemia/MDS and other malignancies is 
clearly a well-known complication of all types of radiation treatment and probably beside the risks 
derived from bone marrow impairment (Bleeding, Infection) the most severe adverse event of RLT. A 
case of AML is already reported. However, it is acknowledged that in an advanced mCRPC population 
with a limited life-expectance the relevance of these events may be probably balanced by the 
improvement in overall survival. As in other RLTs before this important risk remains not fully evaluable 
from the data submitted, but the applicant as committed to provide further data during longer follow-
up.  
It is not known whether AEs related to the safety topics resolved over time as these data were not 
collected by the Applicant. The applicant has meanwhile committed that these data will be submitted at 
the time they become available via the post-marketing requirement (PMR) of the FDA, which is 
intended to collect data on risks of myelosuppression, renal failure, xerostomia and xerophthalmia and 
their complications, and potential of secondary malignancies.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Even though approved treatments exist for (at least) part of the target population, it is noted that 
patients with mCRPC who have previously received a NAAD as well as taxane-based chemotherapy 
have few therapeutic options. 177Lu-PSMA-617 has a new and different mechanism of action and could, 
therefore, be considered a welcome addition to the treatment armamentarium. 
In the pivotal study VISION, treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 showed an improvement in both primary 
endpoints of rPFS by BICR and OS compared with treatment with BSC/BSoC, of which the OS benefit is 
considered clinically relevant. The OS data/results are considered sufficiently mature for B/R 
assessment and are considered robust, as all performed sensitivity/supportive analyses support the OS 
primary analysis and all subgroup analyses for OS provided results consistent with this analysis. The 
rPFS result and the results for the key secondary endpoints (ORR, DCR, and SSE) are considered to 
provide support for the OS result. 
The design of the VISION study was amended several times (as was the SAP), in part in reaction to a 
higher than anticipated rate of patients withdrawing from the control arm in the early part of the 
study. Even though the Applicant did not (fully) comply with SA given on this matter, this is 
acceptable/accepted because the primary endpoint OS is considered to be an objective, ‘hard’ endpoint 
and the OS data/results are considered robust. 
The improved efficacy should be weighed against a more unfavourable safety profile compared with 
BSC/BSoC alone. This is exemplified by higher numbers of all-causality and treatment-related AEs, 
severe AEs, SAEs and treatment-related deaths. Noteworthy are the AEs of myelosuppression which 
are mostly treatment-related and are the main causes of severe AEs, SAEs, treatment-related deaths 
and tolerability issues.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In patients with progressive, PSMA-positive mCRPC, who had received ≥ 1 NAAD and had previously 
been treated with 1-2 taxane-based chemotherapy regimens, treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 showed 
a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in OS compared to treatment with 
BSC/BSoC. The safety profile of 177Lu-PSMA-617 although non-negligible, it is outweighed by the 
compelling efficacy outcomes. It can be agreed that the benefit/risk balance is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In line with the Guidance “Wording of therapeutic indication - A Guide for Assessors of Centralised 
Applications” (EMA/CHMP/483022/2019) “in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) 
with or without androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition” has been added to the indication wording 
based on the following considerations: 
- 
- 
“in combination” includes all anti-cancer medicinal products that patients in the VISION 
study received and by the term “ADT” also encompasses surgical castration; 
“with or without” correctly reflects that AR pathway inhibition was not mandatory, but that 
over half of the patients (52.6% vs. 67.8%) received AR pathway inhibition (by a NAAD 
such as e.g. enzalutamide, abiraterone, apalutamide) in the VISION study as part of 
BSC/BSoC. 
- 
The reference to section 5.1 will guide the prescriber to the relevant information on all 
medicinal products that were required and/or allowed as part of BSC/BSoC in the VISION 
study. 
Furthermore, it was acknowledged that previous treatment with AR pathway inhibition and 
taxane-based chemotherapy can occur at any time during the management of the disease and 
treatment of prostate cancer. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Pluvicto is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Pluvicto is favourable in the following indication: 
Pluvicto in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with or without androgen receptor 
(AR) pathway inhibition is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive 
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC) who have been treated with AR pathway inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy (see 
section 5.1).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
EMA/871459/2022 
Page 120/122 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Pluvicto in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree 
about the content and format of the patient guide, including communication media, distribution 
modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority (NCA). 
The patient guide is aimed to reduce the risk of inadvertent radiation exposure. 
The MAH shall ensure that, in each Member State where Pluvicto is marketed, patients have access to 
the patient guide. 
The Pluvicto patient guide contains the following key elements:

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan is to be qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

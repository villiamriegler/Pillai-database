SUSTIVA has not been adequately studied in patients with advanced HIV disease, namely in patients 
with CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3, or after failure of protease inhibitor (PI) containing regimens. 
Although cross-resistance of efavirenz with PIs has not been documented, there are at present 
insufficient data on the efficacy of subsequent use of PI based combination therapy after failure of 
regimens containing SUSTIVA.

Adults 
Posology 
Dose adjustment 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
Efavirenz must be given in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.5). 
If efavirenz is co-administered with rifampicin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an increase in the 
dose of efavirenz to 800 mg/day may be considered (see section 4.5). 
In order to improve the tolerability of nervous system adverse reactions, bedtime dosing is 
recommended (see section 4.8). 
The recommended dose of efavirenz in combination with nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NRTIs) with or without a PI (see section 4.5) is 600 mg orally, once daily. 
If efavirenz is co-administered with voriconazole, the voriconazole maintenance dose must be 
increased to 400 mg every 12 hours and the efavirenz dose must be reduced by 50%, i.e., to 300 mg 
once daily. When treatment with voriconazole is stopped, the initial dose of efavirenz should be 
restored (see section 4.5). 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
The recommended dose of efavirenz in combination with a PI and/or NRTIs for patients between 3 
months and 17 years of age is described in Table 1. Efavirenz intact hard capsules must only be 
administered to children who are able to reliably swallow hard capsules.

Paediatric population 
Method of administration 
Patients who cannot swallow  
The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, 
less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal 
impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.4). 
The safety and efficacy of efavirenz in children below the age of 3 months or weighing less than 
3.5 kg have not been established. No data are available. 
It is recommended that efavirenz be taken on an empty stomach. The increased efavirenz 
concentrations observed following administration of efavirenz with food may lead to an increase in 
frequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4. and 5.2). 
Patients with mild liver disease may be treated with their normally recommended dose of efavirenz. 
Patients should be monitored carefully for dose-related adverse reactions, especially nervous system 
symptoms (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Co-administraion with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or 
ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) 
because competition for CYP3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the 
potential for serious and/or life-threatening adverse reactions [for example, cardiac arrhythmias, 
prolonged sedation or respiratory depression] (see section 4.5). 
Capsule sprinkle: for patients at least 3 months old and weighing at least 3.5 kg who cannot swallow 
capsules, the capsule contents can be administered with a small amount of food using the capsule 
sprinkle method of administration (see section 6.6 for instructions). No additional food should be 
consumed for up to 2 hours after administration of efavirenz.. 
Herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to the risk of decreased 
plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of efavirenz (see section 4.5). 
Co-administration with elbasvir (EBR) and grazoprevir (GZR) due to the potential for significant 
decreases in plasma concentrations of EBR and GZR (see section 4.5). 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) (see section 5.2). 
Patients with: 
- a family history of sudden death or of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval on 
electrocardiograms, or with any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval. 
- a history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia or with 
congestive cardiac failure accompanied by reduced left ventricle ejection fraction. 
- severe disturbances of electrolyte balance e.g., hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia. 
4.3  Contraindications

- methadone. 
Co-administration of efavirenz with the fixed combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, 
and tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended unless needed for dose adjustment (for example, with 
rifampicin). 
Efavirenz must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV or added on as a sole agent to a failing 
regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when efavirenz is administered as monotherapy. The choice 
of new antiretroviral agent(s) to be used in combination with efavirenz should take into consideration 
the potential for viral cross-resistance (see section 5.1). 
antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, 
neuroleptics, antidepressive agents,

cisapride, 
flecainide, 
certain antimalarials,

Co-administration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Concomitant administration of velpatasvir/sofosbuvir/ voxilaprevir with efavirenz is not recommended 
(see section 4.5). 
Co-administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with efavirenz may significantly decrease plasma 
concentrations of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect. Co-
administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
If any antiretroviral medicinal product in a combination regimen is interrupted because of suspected 
intolerance, serious consideration should be given to simultaneous discontinuation of all antiretroviral 
medicinal products. The antiretroviral medicinal products should be restarted at the same time upon 
resolution of the intolerance symptoms. Intermittent monotherapy and sequential reintroduction of 
antiretroviral agents is not advisable because of the increased potential for selection of resistant virus. 
Mild-to-moderate rash has been reported in clinical studies with efavirenz and usually resolves with 
continued therapy. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and 
hasten the resolution of rash. Severe rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation or ulceration 
has been reported in less than 1% of patients treated with efavirenz. The incidence of erythema 
multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome was approximately 0.1%. Efavirenz must be discontinued in 
patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement or 
fever. If therapy with efavirenz is discontinued, consideration should also be given to interrupting 
therapy with other antiretroviral agents to avoid development of resistant virus (see section 4.8). 
When prescribing medicinal products concomitantly with efavirenz, physicians should refer to the 
corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Rash
5
Experience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class 
is limited (see section 4.8). Efavirenz is not recommended for patients who have had a life-threatening 
cutaneous reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) while taking another NNRTI. 
Psychiatric symptoms 
Seizures 
Nervous system symptoms 
Symptoms including, but not limited to, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and 
abnormal dreaming are frequently reported adverse reactions in patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg 
daily in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Nervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one 
or two days of therapy and generally resolve after the first 2 - 4 weeks. Patients should be informed 
that if they do occur, these common symptoms are likely to improve with continued therapy and are 
not predictive of subsequent onset of any of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms. 
Psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. Patients with a 
prior history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of these serious psychiatric adverse 
reactions. In particular, severe depression was more common in those with a history of depression. 
There have also been post-marketing reports of severe depression, death by suicide, delusions, 
psychosis-like behaviour and catatonia. Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms 
such as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately 
to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to 
determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits (see section 4.8). 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Convulsions have been observed in adult and paediatric patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the 
presence of known medical history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant 
medicinal products primarily metabolised by the liver, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and 
phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels. In a drug interaction study, 
carbamazepine plasma concentrations were decreased when carbamazepine was co-administered with 
efavirenz (see section 4.5). Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. 
A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic 
disease or other identifiable risk factors (see section 4.8). Liver enzyme monitoring should be 
considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. 
The administration of efavirenz with food may increase efavirenz exposure (see section 5.2) and may 
lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see section 4.8). It is recommended that 
efavirenz be taken on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. 
Consider alternatives to efavirenz for co-administration with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de 
Pointes or when to be administered to patients at higher risk of Torsade de Pointes.  
QTc prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  
QTc Prolongation 
Hepatic events 
Effect of food 
Immune Reactivation Syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically,

Osteonecrosis 
Special populations 
Weight and metabolic parameters 
such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. 
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, 
and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any 
inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated, and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune 
disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the 
setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events 
can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy. Such 
changes may in part be linked to disease control and lifestyle. For lipids, there is in some cases 
evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any 
particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV 
treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience 
joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
The safety and efficacy of efavirenz has not been established in patients with significant underlying 
liver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral 
therapy are at increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. Patients with 
pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver 
function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to 
standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease or persistent elevations of serum 
transaminases to greater than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, the benefit of continued 
therapy with efavirenz needs to be weighed against the potential risks of significant liver toxicity. In 
such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered (see section 4.8). 
Efavirenz is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2) and 
not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of insufficient data to 
determine whether dose adjustment is necessary. Because of the extensive cytochrome P450-mediated 
metabolism of efavirenz and limited clinical experience in patients with chronic liver disease, caution 
must be exercised in administering efavirenz to patients with mild hepatic impairment. Patients should 
be monitored carefully for dose-related adverse reactions, especially nervous system symptoms. 
Laboratory tests should be performed to evaluate their liver disease at periodic intervals (see 
section 4.2). 
In patients treated with other medicinal products associated with liver toxicity, monitoring of liver 
enzymes is also recommended. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please 
refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. 
Liver disease 
Renal insufficiency 
The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, 
less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal 
impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.2). There is no experience in 
patients with severe renal failure and close safety monitoring is recommended in this population.

Elderly patients 
Insufficient numbers of elderly patients have been evaluated in clinical studies to determine whether 
they respond differently than younger patients.

Paediatric population
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Efavirenz has not been evaluated in children below 3 months of age or who weigh less than 3.5 kg. 
Therefore, efavirenz should not be given to children less than 3 months of age. 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-
galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.  
Rash was reported in 59 of 182 children (32%) treated with efavirenz  and was severe in six patients. 
Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines prior to initiating therapy with efavirenz in children may 
be considered. 
Efavirenz is an in vivo inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1. Compounds that are substrates of 
these enzymes may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administered with efavirenz. In 
vitro efavirenz is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Theoretically, efavirenz may therefore initially 
increase the exposure to CYP3A4 substrates and caution is warranted for CYP3A4 substrates with 
narrow therapeutic index (see section 4.3). Efavirenz may be an inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; 
however, inhibition has also been observed in vitro and the net effect of co-administration with 
substrates of these enzymes is not clear (see section 5.2). 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Efavirenz exposure may be increased when given with medicinal products (for example, ritonavir) or 
food (for example, grapefruit juice), which inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 activity. Compounds or 
herbal preparations (for example Ginkgo biloba extracts and St. John’s wort) which induce these 
enzymes may give rise to decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz. Concomitant use of St. John’s 
wort is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
Efavirenz is contraindicated with concomitant use of drugs (they may cause prolonged QTc interval 
and Torsade de Pointes) such as: antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressant 
agents, certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides,  
fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents, certain non-sedating antihistaminics 
(terfenadine, astemizole), cisapride, flecainide, certain antimalarials and methadone (see section 4.3). 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Contraindications of concomitant use 
QT Prolonging Drugs 
Paediatric population
Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, 
triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, 
ergonovine, and methylergonovine), since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-
threatening events (see section 4.3). 
Elbasvir/grazoprevir 
8
Concomitant administration of efavirenz with elbasvir/grazoprevir is contraindicated because it may 
lead to loss of virologic response to elbasvir/grazoprevir. This loss is due to significant decreases in 
elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations caused by CYP3A4 induction. (see section 4.3).

Table 2: Interactions between efavirenz and other medicinal products in adults 
Interactions between efavirenz and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease 
inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is 
indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, and once every 8 or 12 hours as “q8h” or 
“q12h”). If available, 90% or 95% confidence intervals are shown in parentheses. Studies were 
conducted in healthy subjects unless otherwise noted.  
Co-administration of efavirenz and St. John’s wort or herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort is 
contraindicated. Plasma levels of efavirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of St. John’s wort due 
to induction of drug metabolising enzymes and/or transport proteins by St. John’s wort. If a patient is 
already taking St. John’s wort, stop St. John’s wort, check viral levels and if possible efavirenz levels. 
Efavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John’s wort and the dose of efavirenz may need 
adjusting. The inducing effect of St. John’s wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of 
treatment. (see section 4.3).

When efavirenz was given with 
ritonavir 500 mg or 600 mg twice 
daily, the combination was not well 
tolerated (for example, dizziness, 
nausea, paraesthesia and elevated liver 
enzymes occurred). Sufficient data on 
the tolerability of efavirenz with low-
dose ritonavir (100 mg, once or twice 
daily) are not available. 
Interaction not studied. 
When using efavirenz with low-
dose ritonavir, the possibility of 
an increase in the incidence of 
efavirenz-associated adverse 
events should be considered, 
due to possible 
pharmacodynamic interaction. 
No data are available to make a 
dose recommendation. See also 
ritonavir row above. Use of 
efavirenz in combination with 
saquinavir as the sole protease 
inhibitor is not recommended.

Contraception in males and females 
21
Barrier contraception should always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (for 
example, oral or other hormonal contraceptives, see section 4.5). Because of the long half-life of 
efavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of efavirenz is 
recommended.  
Pregnancy 
Breast-feeding 
Malformations have been observed in foetuses from efavirenz-treated monkeys (see section 5.3). 
As of July 2013, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) has received prospective reports of 904 
pregnancies with first trimester exposure to efavirenz-containing regimens, resulting in 766 live births. 
One child was reported to have a neural tube defect, and the frequency and pattern of other birth 
defects were similar to those seen in children exposed to non-efavirenz-containing regimens, as well as 
those in HIV negative controls. The incidence of neural tube defects in the general population ranges 
from 0.5-1 case per 1,000 live births. 
There have been seven retrospective reports of findings consistent with neural tube defects, including 
meningomyelocele, all in mothers exposed to efavirenz-containing regimens (excluding any efavirenz-
containing fixed-dose combination tablets) in the first trimester. Two additional cases (1 prospective 
and 1 retrospective) including events consistent with neural tube defects have been reported with the 
fixed-dose combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. 
A causal relationship of these events to the use of efavirenz has not been established, and the 
denominator is unknown. As neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of foetal development 
(at which time neural tubes are sealed), this potential risk would concern women exposed to efavirenz 
during the first trimester of pregnancy.

The effect of efavirenz on male and female fertility in rats has only been evaluated at doses that 
achieved systemic drug exposures equivalent to or below those achieved in humans given 
recommended doses of efavirenz. In these studies, efavirenz did not impair mating or fertility of male 
or female rats (doses up to 100 mg/kg/bid) and did not affect sperm or offspring of treated male rats 
(doses up to 200 mg/bid). The reproductive performance of offspring born to female rats given 
efavirenz was not affected.  
Efavirenz has been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the 
effects of efavirenz in newborns/infants. Risk to the infant cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should 
be discontinued during treatment with SUSTIVA. It is recommended that women living with HIV do 
not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV. 
Efavirenz may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and/or somnolence. Patients should be 
instructed that if they experience these symptoms, they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such 
as driving or operating machinery.

Summary of the safety profile 
Efavirenz has been studied in over 9,000 patients. In a subset of 1,008 adult patients who received 
600 mg efavirenz daily in combination with PIs and/or NRTIs in controlled clinical studies, the most 
frequently reported adverse reactions of at least moderate severity reported in at least 5% of patients 
were rash (11.6%), dizziness (8.5%), nausea (8.0%), headache (5.7%) and fatigue (5.5%). The most

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Immune system disorders 
uncommon 
notable adverse reactions associated with efavirenz are rash and nervous system symptoms. Nervous 
system symptoms usually begin soon after therapy onset and generally resolve after the first 2 - 4 
weeks. Severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme; psychiatric 
adverse reactions including severe depression, death by suicide, and psychosis like behaviour; and 
seizures have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. The administration of efavirenz with 
food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse 
reactions (see section 4.4). 
The long-term safety profile of efavirenz-containing regimens was evaluated in a controlled trial (006) 
in which patients received efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 412, median duration 
180 weeks), efavirenz + indinavir (n = 415, median duration 102 weeks), or indinavir + zidovudine + 
lamivudine (n = 401, median duration 76 weeks). Long-term use of efavirenz in this study was not 
associated with any new safety concerns. 
Adverse reactions of moderate or greater severity with at least possible relationship to treatment 
regimen (based on investigator attribution) reported in clinical trials of efavirenz at the recommended 
dose in combination therapy (n = 1,008) are listed below. Also listed in italics are adverse reactions 
observed post-marketing in association with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral treatment regimens.

Rash 
In clinical studies, 26% of patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz experienced skin rash compared 
with 17% of patients treated in control groups. Skin rash was considered treatment related in 18% of 
patients treated with efavirenz. Severe rash occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with efavirenz, 
and 1.7% discontinued therapy because of rash. The incidence of erythema multiforme or Stevens-
Johnson syndrome was approximately 0.1%. 
24
Psychiatric symptoms 
Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first two 
weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz. In most patients rash resolves with continuing therapy with 
efavirenz within one month. Efavirenz can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of 
rash. Use of appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids is recommended when efavirenz is 
restarted.

Serious psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. In

Patients with a history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of these serious psychiatric 
adverse reactions with frequencies ranging from 0.3% for manic reactions to 2.0% for both severe 
depression and suicidal ideation. There have also been post-marketing reports of death by suicide, 
delusions, psychosis-like behaviour and catatonia. 
Experience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class 
is limited. Reported rates of recurrent rash following a switch from nevirapine to efavirenz therapy, 
primarily based on retrospective cohort data from published literature, range from 13 to 18%, 
comparable to the rate observed in patients treated with efavirenz in clinical studies. (See section 4.4.)

Nervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one or two days of therapy and generally 
resolve after the first 2 - 4 weeks. In a study of uninfected volunteers, a representative nervous system 
symptom had a median time to onset of 1 hour post-dose and a median duration of 3 hours. Nervous 
system symptoms may occur more frequently when efavirenz is taken concomitantly with meals 
possibly due to increased efavirenz plasma levels (see section 5.2). Dosing at bedtime seems to 
improve the tolerability of these symptoms and can be recommended during the first weeks of therapy 
and in patients who continue to experience these symptoms (see section 4.2). Dose reduction or 
splitting the daily dose has not been shown to provide benefit. 
In clinical controlled trials, frequently reported adverse reactions included, but were not limited to 
dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming. Nervous system 
symptoms of moderate-to-severe intensity were experienced by 19% (severe 2%) of patients compared 
to 9% (severe 1%) of patients receiving control regimens. In clinical studies 2% of patients treated 
with efavirenz discontinued therapy due to such symptoms. 
Analysis of long-term data showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset 
nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the 
control arm. 
Nervous system symptoms 
Hepatic failure 
A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing 
hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, were characterized by a fulminant course, progressing 
in some cases to transplantation or death.

Immune Reactivation Syndrome 
Osteonecrosis 
Laboratory test abnormalities 
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have 
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur 
many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). 
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). 
Amylase: in the clinical trial subset of 1,008 patients, asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels 
greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were seen in 10% of patients treated with efavirenz 
and 6% of patients treated with control regimens. The clinical significance of asymptomatic increases 
in serum amylase is unknown. 
Liver enzymes: elevations of AST and ALT to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal 
range (ULN) were seen in 3% of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5-8% after long-
term treatment in study 006). Similar elevations were seen in patients treated with control regimens 
(5% after long-term treatment). Elevations of GGT to greater than five times ULN were observed in 
4% of all patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz and 1.5-2% of patients treated with control 
regimens (7% of efavirenz-treated patients and 3% of control-treated patients after long-term 
treatment). Isolated elevations of GGT in patients receiving efavirenz may reflect enzyme induction. 
In the long-term study (006), 1% of patients in each treatment arm discontinued because of liver or 
biliary system disorders. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Liver enzymes in hepatitis B or C co-infected patients: in the long-term data set from study 006, 
137 patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and 
84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening for 
hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) and/or C (hepatitis C antibody positive). Among co-infected 
patients in study 006, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13% of 
efavirenz-treated patients and in 7% of controls, and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN 
developed in 20% and 7%, respectively. Among co-infected patients, 3% of those treated with 
efavirenz and 2% in the control arm discontinued because of liver disorders (see section 4.4).
Undesirable effects in children were generally similar to those of adult patients. Rash was reported 
more frequently in children (59 of 182 (32%) treated with efavirenz) and was more often of higher 
grade than in adults (severe rash was reported in 6 of 182 (3.3%) of children). Prophylaxis with 
appropriate antihistamines prior to initiating therapy with efavirenz in children may be considered.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors. ATC code: J05AG03 
Some patients accidentally taking 600 mg twice daily have reported increased nervous system 
symptoms. One patient experienced involuntary muscle contractions. 
Efavirenz is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Efavirenz is a non-competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse 
transcriptase (RT) and does not significantly inhibit HIV-2 RT or cellular DNA polymerases (α, β, γ or 
δ). 
Treatment of overdose with efavirenz should consist of general supportive measures, including 
monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient’s clinical status. Administration of activated 
charcoal may be used to aid removal of unabsorbed efavirenz. There is no specific antidote for 
overdose with efavirenz. Since efavirenz is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to remove 
significant quantities of it from blood.

The effect of efavirenz on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, positive and placebo 
controlled, fixed single sequence 3-period, 3-treatment crossover QT study in 58 healthy subjects 
enriched for CYP2B6 polymorphisms. The mean Cmax of efavirenz in subjects with CYP2B6 *6/*6 
genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days was 2.25-fold the mean Cmax 
observed in subjects with CYP2B6 *1/*1 genotype. A positive relationship between efavirenz 
concentration and QTc prolongation was observed. Based on the concentration-QTc relationship, the 
mean QTc prolongation and its upper bound 90% confidence interval are 8.7 ms and 11.3 ms in 
subjects with CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days 
(see section 4.5).
The free concentration of efavirenz required for 90 to 95% inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-
resistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell 
lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/monocyte cultures. 
The potency of efavirenz in cell culture against viral variants with amino acid substitutions at positions 
48, 108, 179, 181 or 236 in RT or variants with amino acid substitutions in the protease was similar to 
that observed against wild type viral strains. The single substitutions which led to the highest 
resistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 
(L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-fold 
resistance). Greater than 100-fold loss of susceptibility was observed against HIV variants expressing 
K103N in addition to other amino acid substitutions in RT. 
Antiviral activity 
Resistance 
27
Cross resistance 
K103N was the most frequently observed RT substitution in viral isolates from patients who 
experienced a significant rebound in viral load during clinical studies of efavirenz in combination with 
indinavir or zidovudine + lamivudine. This mutation was observed in 90% of patients receiving 
efavirenz with virological failure. Substitutions at RT positions 98, 100, 101, 108, 138, 188, 190 or 
225 were also observed, but at lower frequencies, and often only in combination with K103N. The 
pattern of amino acid substitutions in RT associated with resistance to efavirenz was independent of 
the other antiviral medicines used in combination with efavirenz. 
The potential for cross resistance between efavirenz and PIs is low because of the different enzyme 
targets involved. The potential for cross-resistance between efavirenz and NRTIs is low because of the 
different binding sites on the target and mechanism of action. 
Cross resistance profiles for efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine in cell culture demonstrated that the 
K103N substitution confers loss of susceptibility to all three NNRTIs. Two of three delavirdine-
resistant clinical isolates examined were cross-resistant to efavirenz and contained the K103N 
substitution. A third isolate which carried a substitution at position 236 of RT was not cross-resistant 
to efavirenz. 
Viral isolates recovered from PBMCs of patients enrolled in efavirenz clinical studies who showed 
evidence of treatment failure (viral load rebound) were assessed for susceptibility to NNRTIs. Thirteen 
isolates previously characterised as efavirenz-resistant were also resistant to nevirapine and 
delavirdine. Five of these NNRTI-resistant isolates were found to have K103N or a valine-to-
isoleucine substitution at position 108 (V108I) in RT. Three of the efavirenz treatment failure isolates 
tested remained sensitive to efavirenz in cell culture and were also sensitive to nevirapine and 
delavirdine.

Two controlled studies (006 and ACTG 364) of approximately one year duration with efavirenz in 
combination with NRTIs and/or PIs, have demonstrated reduction of viral load below the limit of 
quantification of the assay and increased CD4 lymphocytes in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and NRTI-
experienced HIV-infected patients. Study 020 showed similar activity in NRTI-experienced patients 
over 24 weeks. In these studies, the dose of efavirenz was 600 mg once daily; the dose of indinavir 
was 1,000 mg every 8 hours when used with efavirenz and 800 mg every 8 hours when used without 
efavirenz. The dose of nelfinavir was 750 mg given three times a day. The standard doses of NRTIs 
given every 12 hours were used in each of these studies. 
Study 006, a randomized, open-label trial, compared efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine or 
efavirenz + indinavir with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine in 1,266 patients who were required to 
be efavirenz-, lamivudine-, NNRTI-, and PI-naive at study entry. The mean baseline CD4 cell count 
was 341 cells/mm3 and the mean baseline HIV-RNA level was 60,250 copies/mL. Efficacy results for 
study 006 on a subset of 614 patients who had been enrolled for at least 48 weeks are found in Table 3. 
In the analysis of responder rates (the non-completer equals failure analysis [NC = F]), patients who 
terminated the study early for any reason, or who had a missing HIV-RNA measurement that was 
either preceded or followed by a measurement above the limit of assay quantification were considered 
to have HIV-RNA above 50 or above 400 copies/mL at the missing time points. 
Efavirenz has not been studied in controlled studies in patients with advanced HIV disease, namely 
with CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3, or in PI or NNRTI experienced patients. Clinical experience in 
controlled studies with combinations including didanosine or zalcitabine is limited.

 Study AI266922 was an open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and 
antiviral activity of SUSTIVA in combination with didanosine and emtricitabine in antiretroviral-naive 
and -experienced paediatric patients. Thirty-seven patients 3 months to 6 years of age (median 0.7 
years) were treated with SUSTIVA. At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.88 log10
copies/mL, median CD4+ cell count was 1144 cells/mm3, and median CD4+ percentage was 25%. The 
median time on study therapy was 132 weeks; 27% of patients discontinued before Week 48. Using an 
ITT analysis, the overall proportions of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL at 
Week 48 were 57% (21/37) and 46% (17/37), respectively. The median increase from baseline in 
CD4+ count at 48 weeks was 215 cells/mm3 and the median increase in CD4+ percentage was 6%. 
Study PACTG 1021 was an open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and 
antiviral activity of SUSTIVA in combination with didanosine and emtricitabine in paediatric patients 
who were antiretroviral therapy naive. Forty-three patients 3 months to 21 years of age (median 
9.6 years) were dosed with SUSTIVA. At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 
4.8 log10 copies/mL, median CD4+ cell count was 367 cells/mm3, and median CD4+ percentage was 
18%. The median time on study therapy was 181 weeks; 16% of patients discontinued before Week 
48. Using an ITT analysis, the overall proportions of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and 
<50 copies/mL at Week 48 were 77% (33/43) and 70% (30/43), respectively. The median increase 
from baseline in CD4+ count at 48 weeks of therapy was 238 cells/mm3 and the median increase in 
CD4+ percentage was 13%. 
Study PACTG 382 was an open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and 
antiviral activity of SUSTIVA in combination with nelfinavir and an NRTI in antiretroviral-naive and 
NRTI-experienced paediatric patients. One hundred two patients 3 months to 16 years of age (median 
5.7 years) were treated with SUSTIVA. Eighty-seven percent of patients had received prior 
antiretroviral therapy. At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.57 log10 copies/mL, median 
CD4+ cell count was 755 cells/mm3, and median CD4+ percentage was 30%. The median time on 
study therapy was 118 weeks; 25% of patients discontinued before Week 48. Using an ITT analysis, 
the overall proportion of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL at Week 48 
were 57% (58/102) and 43% (44/102), respectively. The median increase from baseline in CD4+ count 
at 48 weeks of therapy was 128 cells/mm3 and the median increase in CD4+ percentage was 5%.

Peak efavirenz plasma concentrations of 1.6 - 9.1 μM were attained by 5 hours following single oral 
doses of 100 mg to 1,600 mg administered to uninfected volunteers. Dose related increases in Cmax and 
AUC were seen for doses up to 1,600 mg; the increases were less than proportional suggesting 
diminished absorption at higher doses. Time to peak plasma concentrations (3 - 5 hours) did not 
change following multiple dosing and steady-state plasma concentrations were reached in 6 - 7 days. 
In HIV infected patients at steady state, mean Cmax, mean Cmin, and mean AUC were linear with 
200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg daily doses. In 35 patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily, steady 
state Cmax was 12.9 ± 3.7 μM (29%) mean ± S.D. (% C.V.), steady state Cmin was 
5.6 ± 3.2 μM (57%), and AUC was 184 ± 73 μM·h (40%). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Effect of food 
Absorption 
The bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of efavirenz hard capsules in uninfected volunteers was 
increased 22% and 17%, respectively, when given with a meal of high fat or normal composition, 
relative to the bioavailability of a 600 mg dose given under fasted conditions (see section 4.4).
Bioavailability of hard capsule contents mixed with food vehicles 
30
In healthy adult subjects, the efavirenz AUC when administered as the contents of three 200 mg hard 
capsules mixed with 2 teaspoons of certain food vehicles (applesauce, grape jelly, yogurt or infant 
formula) met bioequivalency criteria for the AUC of the intact capsule formulation administered under 
fasted conditions. 
Distribution 
Biotransformation 
Efavirenz plasma exposure may be increased in patients with the homozygous G516T genetic variant 
of the CYP2B6 isoenzyme. The clinical implications of such an association are unknown; however, 
the potential for an increased frequency and severity of efavirenz-associated adverse events cannot be 
excluded. 
Efavirenz is highly bound (approximately 99.5 - 99.75%) to human plasma proteins, predominantly 
albumin. In HIV-1 infected patients (n = 9) who received efavirenz 200 to 600 mg once daily for at 
least one month, cerebrospinal fluid concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 1.19% (mean 0.69%) of the 
corresponding plasma concentration. This proportion is approximately 3-fold higher than the non-
protein-bound (free) fraction of efavirenz in plasma. 
Studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that 
efavirenz is principally metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system to hydroxylated metabolites with 
subsequent glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites. These metabolites are essentially 
inactive against HIV-1. The in vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major 
isozymes responsible for efavirenz metabolism and that it inhibited P450 isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and 
3A4. In in vitro studies efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 only at 
concentrations well above those achieved clinically. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Efavirenz has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, resulting in the induction of its own 
metabolism, which may be clinically relevant in some patients. In uninfected volunteers, multiple 
doses of 200 - 400 mg per day for 10 days resulted in a lower than predicted extent of accumulation 
(22 - 42% lower) and a shorter terminal half-life compared with single dose administration (see 
below). Efavirenz has also been shown to induce UGT1A1. Exposures of raltegravir (a UGT1A1 
substrate) are reduced in the presence of efavirenz (see section 4.5, table 2). 
Although in vitro data suggest that efavirenz inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, there have been 
contradictory reports of both increased and decreased exposures to substrates of these enzymes when 
co-administered with efavirenz in vivo. The net effect of co-administration is not clear. 
In a single-dose study, half-life was doubled in the single patient with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh Class C), indicating a potential for a much greater degree of accumulation. A multiple-
dose study showed no significant effect on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) compared with controls. There were insufficient data to determine 
whether moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) affects efavirenz 
pharmacokinetics. 
Efavirenz has a relatively long terminal half-life of at least 52 hours after single doses and 
40 - 55 hours after multiple doses. Approximately 14 - 34% of a radiolabelled dose of efavirenz was 
recovered in the urine and less than 1% of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged efavirenz.

Although limited data suggest that females as well as Asian and Pacific Island patients may have

Efavirenz induced foetal resorptions in rats. Malformations were observed in 3 of 20 foetuses/ 
newborns from efavirenz-treated cynomolgus monkeys given doses resulting in plasma efavirenz 
concentrations similar to those seen in humans. Anencephaly and unilateral anophthalmia with 
secondary enlargement of the tongue were observed in one foetus, microophthalmia was observed in 
another foetus, and cleft palate was observed in a third foetus. No malformations were observed in 
foetuses from efavirenz-treated rats and rabbits. 
Biliary hyperplasia was observed in cynomolgus monkeys given efavirenz for ≥ 1 year at a dose 
resulting in mean AUC values approximately 2-fold greater than those in humans given the 
recommended dose. The biliary hyperplasia regressed upon cessation of dosing. Biliary fibrosis has 
been observed in rats. Non-sustained convulsions were observed in some monkeys receiving efavirenz 
for ≥ 1 year, at doses yielding plasma AUC values 4- to 13-fold greater than those in humans given the 
recommended dose (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Carcinogenicity studies in male mice, male and female rats were negative. While the carcinogenic 
potential in humans is unknown, these data suggest that the clinical benefit of efavirenz outweighs the 
potential carcinogenic risk to humans. 
Carcinogenicity studies showed an increased incidence of hepatic and pulmonary tumours in female 
mice, but not in male mice. The mechanism of tumour formation and the potential relevance for 
humans are not known.

For patients at least 3 months old and weighing at least 3.5 kg who cannot swallow capsules, the 
capsule contents can be administered with a small amount (1-2 teaspoons) of food using the capsule 
sprinkle method of administration. Patients and caregivers must be instructed to open the capsule 
carefully to avoid spillage or dispersion of the capsule contents into the air. It is recommended to hold 
the capsule with the cap facing up and to pull the cap away from the body of the capsule, and to mix 
the capsule contents with food in a small container. The mixture should be administered as soon as 
possible, but no more than 30 minutes after mixing. After administration of the efavirenz-food 
mixture, an additional small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of food must be added to the empty 
mixing container, stirred to disperse any remaining residue of the medicinal product, and administered 
to the patient. No additional food should be consumed for up to 2 hours after administration of 
efavirenz.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
Each film-coated tablet contains 600 mg of efavirenz. 
Dark yellow, capsule-shaped, printed with “SUSTIVA” on both sides.
Excipient with known effect 
Each film-coated tablet contains 249.6 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). 
SUSTIVA is indicated in antiviral combination treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-
1) infected adults, adolescents and children 3 months of age and older and weighing at least 3.5 kg. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
SUSTIVA has not been adequately studied in patients with advanced HIV disease, namely in patients 
with CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3, or after failure of protease inhibitor (PI) containing regimens. 
Although cross-resistance of efavirenz with PIs has not been documented, there are at present 
insufficient data on the efficacy of subsequent use of PI based combination therapy after failure of 
regimens containing SUSTIVA. 
In order to improve the tolerability of nervous system adverse reactions, bedtime dosing is 
recommended (see section 4.8). 
The recommended dose of efavirenz in combination with nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NRTIs) with or without a PI (see section 4.5) is 600 mg orally, once daily. 
Efavirenz must be given in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.5). 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
For a summary of clinical and pharmacodynamic information, see section 5.1. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Adults and adolescents over 40 kg
Posology 
Efavirenz film-coated tablets are not suitable for children weighing less than 40 kg. Efavirenz hard 
capsules are available for these patients. 
Dose adjustment 
35
If efavirenz is co-administered with voriconazole, the voriconazole maintenance dose must be 
increased to 400 mg every 12 hours and the efavirenz dose must be reduced by 50%, i.e., to 300 mg 
once daily. When treatment with voriconazole is stopped, the initial dose of efavirenz should be 
restored (see section 4.5). 
Renal impairment 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of efavirenz in children below the age of 3 months or weighing less than 
3.5 kg have not been established. No data are available. 
If efavirenz is co-administered with rifampicin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an increase in the 
dose of efavirenz to 800 mg/day may be considered (see section 4.5). 
The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, 
less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal 
impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.4). 
Patients with mild liver disease may be treated with their normally recommended dose of efavirenz. 
Patients should be monitored carefully for dose-related adverse reactions, especially nervous system 
symptoms (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Co-administraion with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or 
ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) 
because competition for CYP3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the 
potential for serious and/or life-threatening adverse reactions [for example, cardiac arrhythmias, 
prolonged sedation or respiratory depression] (see section 4.5). 
It is recommended that efavirenz be taken on an empty stomach. The increased efavirenz 
concentrations observed following administration of efavirenz with food may lead to an increase in 
frequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4. and 5.2). 
Herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to the risk of decreased 
plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of efavirenz (see section 4.5). 
Co-administration with elbasvir (EBR) and grazoprevir (GZR) due to the potential for significant 
decreases in plasma concentrations of EBR and GZR (see section 4.5). 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Method of administration 
Patients with: 
- a family history of sudden death or of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval on 
electrocardiograms, or with any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval. 
- a history of symptomatic cardiac arrythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia or with 
congestive cardiac failure accompanied by reduced left ventricle ejection fraction.

Co-administration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Concomitant administration of velpatasvir/sofosbuvir/ voxilaprevir with efavirenz is not recommended 
(see section 4.5). 
Co-administration of efavirenz with the fixed combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, 
and tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended unless needed for dose adjustment (for example, with 
rifampicin). 
Efavirenz must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV or added on as a sole agent to a failing 
regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when efavirenz is administered as monotherapy. The choice 
of new antiretroviral agent(s) to be used in combination with efavirenz should take into consideration 
the potential for viral cross-resistance (see section 5.1).

If any antiretroviral medicinal product in a combination regimen is interrupted because of suspected 
intolerance, serious consideration should be given to simultaneous discontinuation of all antiretroviral 
medicinal products. The antiretroviral medicinal products should be restarted at the same time upon 
resolution of the intolerance symptoms. Intermittent monotherapy and sequential reintroduction of 
antiretroviral agents is not advisable because of the increased potential for selection of resistant virus. 
Mild -to-moderate rash has been reported in clinical studies with efavirenz and usually resolves with 
continued therapy. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and 
hasten the resolution of rash. Severe rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation or ulceration 
has been reported in less than 1% of patients treated with efavirenz. The incidence of erythema 
multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome was approximately 0.1%. Efavirenz must be discontinued in 
patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement or 
fever. If therapy with efavirenz is discontinued, consideration should also be given to interrupting 
therapy with other antiretroviral agents to avoid development of resistant virus (see section 4.8). 
Co-administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with efavirenz may significantly decrease plasma 
concentrations of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect. Co-
administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
When prescribing medicinal products concomitantly with efavirenz, physicians should refer to the 
corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Rash
37
Experience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class 
is limited (see section 4.8). Efavirenz is not recommended for patients who have had a life-threatening 
cutaneous reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) while taking another NNRTI. 
Psychiatric symptoms 
Seizures 
Nervous system symptoms
Symptoms including, but not limited to, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and 
abnormal dreaming are frequently reported adverse reactions in patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg 
daily in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Nervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one 
or two days of therapy and generally resolve after the first 2 - 4 weeks. Patients should be informed 
that if they do occur, these common symptoms are likely to improve with continued therapy and are 
not predictive of subsequent onset of any of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms. 
Psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. Patients with a 
prior history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of these serious psychiatric adverse 
reactions. In particular, severe depression was more common in those with a history of depression. 
There have also been post-marketing reports of severe depression, death by suicide, delusions, 
psychosis-like behaviour and catatonia. Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms 
such as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately 
to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to 
determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits (see section 4.8). 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Convulsions have been observed in adult and paediatric patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the 
presence of known medical history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant 
medicinal products primarily metabolised by the liver, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and 
phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels. In a drug interaction study, 
carbamazepine plasma concentrations were decreased when carbamazepine was co-administered with 
efavirenz (see section 4.5). Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. 
A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic 
disease or other identifiable risk factors (see section 4.8). Liver enzyme monitoring should be 
considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. 
The administration of efavirenz with food may increase efavirenz exposure (see section 5.2) and may 
lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see section 4.8). It is recommended that 
efavirenz be taken on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. 
Consider alternatives to efavirenz for co-administration with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de 
Pointes or when to be administered to patients at higher risk of Torsade de Pointes.  
QTc prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).

Immune Reactivation Syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, 
38
Osteonecrosis 
Special populations 
Weight and metabolic parameters 
such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. 
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, 
and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any 
inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated, and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune 
disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the 
setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events 
can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy. Such 
changes may in part be linked to disease control and lifestyle. For lipids, there is in some cases 
evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any 
particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV 
treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience 
joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.

The safety and efficacy of efavirenz has not been established in patients with significant underlying 
liver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral 
therapy are at increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. Patients with 
pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver 
function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to 
standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease or persistent elevations of serum 
transaminases to greater than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, the benefit of continued 
therapy with efavirenz needs to be weighed against the potential risks of significant liver toxicity. In 
such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered (see section 4.8).  
Efavirenz is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2) and 
not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of insufficient data to 
determine whether dose adjustment is necessary. Because of the extensive cytochrome P450-mediated 
metabolism of efavirenz and limited clinical experience in patients with chronic liver disease, caution 
must be exercised in administering efavirenz to patients with mild hepatic impairment. Patients should 
be monitored carefully for dose-related adverse reactions, especially nervous system symptoms. 
Laboratory tests should be performed to evaluate their liver disease at periodic intervals (see 
section 4.2). 
In patients treated with other medicinal products associated with liver toxicity, monitoring of liver 
enzymes is also recommended. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please 
refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. 
Liver disease
Renal insufficiency 
The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, 
less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal 
39
impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.2). There is no experience in 
patients with severe renal failure and close safety monitoring is recommended in this population.

Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Insufficient numbers of elderly patients have been evaluated in clinical studies to determine whether 
they respond differently than younger patients. 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-
galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.  
Efavirenz has not been evaluated in children below 3 months of age or who weigh less than 3.5 kg. 
Therefore, efavirenz should not be given to children less than 3 months of age. Efavirenz film-coated 
tablets are not suitable for children weighing less than 40 kg. 
Rash was reported in 59 of 182 children (32%) treated with efavirenz and was severe in six patients. 
Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines prior to initiating therapy with efavirenz in children may 
be considered.

Efavirenz is an in vivo inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1. Compounds that are substrates of 
these enzymes may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administered with efavirenz. In 
vitro efavirenz is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Theoretically, efavirenz may therefore initially 
increase the exposure to CYP3A4 substrates and caution is warranted for CYP3A4 substrates with 
narrow therapeutic index (see section 4.3). Efavirenz may be an inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; 
however, inhibition has also been observed in vitro and the net effect of co-administration with 
substrates of these enzymes is not clear (see section 5.2). 
Efavirenz exposure may be increased when given with medicinal products (for example, ritonavir) or 
food (for example, grapefruit juice), which inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 activity. Compounds or 
herbal preparations (for example Ginkgo biloba extracts and St. John’s wort) which induce these 
enzymes may give rise to decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz. Concomitant use of St. John’s 
wort is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
Efavirenz is contraindicated with concomitant use of drugs (they may cause prolonged QTc interval 
and Torsade de Pointes) such as: antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressant 
agents, certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides,  
fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents, certain non-sedating antihistaminics 
(terfenadine, astemizole), cisapride, flecainide, certain antimalarials and methadone (see section 4.3). 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
QT Prolonging Drugs 
Paediatric population 
Contraindications of concomitant use 
Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, 
triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, 
40
ergonovine, and methylergonovine), since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-
threatening events (see section 4.3). 
Elbasvir/grazoprevir 
Other interactions 
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)
Table 1: Interactions between efavirenz and other medicinal products in adults 
Concomitant administration of efavirenz with elbasvir/grazoprevir is contraindicated because it may 
lead to loss of virologic response to elbasvir/grazoprevir. This loss is due to significant decreases in 
elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations caused by CYP3A4 induction. (see section 4.3). 
Interactions between efavirenz and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease 
inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below (increase is 
indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, and once every 8 or 12 hours as “q8h” or 
“q12h”). If available, 90% or 95% confidence intervals are shown in parentheses. Studies were 
conducted in healthy subjects unless otherwise noted.  
Co-administration of efavirenz and St. John’s wort or herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort is 
contraindicated. Plasma levels of efavirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of St. John’s wort due 
to induction of drug metabolising enzymes and/or transport proteins by St. John’s wort. If a patient is 
already taking St. John’s wort, stop St. John’s wort, check viral levels and if possible efavirenz levels. 
Efavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John’s wort and the dose of efavirenz may need 
adjusting. The inducing effect of St. John’s wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of 
treatment (see section 4.3).

Co-administration of efavirenz 
with medicinal products that

expected to affect efavirenz 
absorption. 
Concomitant use with efavirenz 
is not recommended due to 
significant decrease in plasma

with risk of treatment failure 
due to increased hepatic

Contraception in males and females 
53
Barrier contraception should always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (for 
example, oral or other hormonal contraceptives, see section 4.5). Because of the long half-life of 
efavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of efavirenz is 
recommended.  
Pregnancy 
Breast-feeding 
Malformations have been observed in foetuses from efavirenz-treated monkeys (see section 5.3). 
As of July 2013, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) has received prospective reports of 904 
pregnancies with first trimester exposure to efavirenz-containing regimens, resulting in 766 live births. 
One child was reported to have a neural tube defect, and the frequency and pattern of other birth 
defects were similar to those seen in children exposed to non-efavirenz-containing regimens, as well as 
those in HIV negative controls. The incidence of neural tube defects in the general population ranges 
from 0.5-1 case per 1,000 live births. 
There have been seven retrospective reports of findings consistent with neural tube defects, including 
meningomyelocele, all in mothers exposed to efavirenz-containing regimens (excluding any efavirenz-
containing fixed-dose combination tablets) in the first trimester. Two additional cases (1 prospective 
and 1 retrospective) including events consistent with neural tube defects have been reported with the 
fixed-dose combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. 
A causal relationship of these events to the use of efavirenz has not been established, and the 
denominator is unknown. As neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of foetal development 
(at which time neural tubes are sealed), this potential risk would concern women exposed to efavirenz 
during the first trimester of pregnancy.

The effect of efavirenz on male and female fertility in rats has only been evaluated at doses that 
achieved systemic drug exposures equivalent to or below those achieved in humans given 
recommended doses of efavirenz. In these studies, efavirenz did not impair mating or fertility of male 
or female rats (doses up to 100 mg/kg/bid), and did not affect sperm or offspring of treated male rats 
(doses up to 200 mg/bid). The reproductive performance of offspring born to female rats given 
efavirenz was not affected.  
Efavirenz has been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the 
effects of efavirenz in newborns/infants. Risk to the infant cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should 
be discontinued during treatment with SUSTIVA. It is recommended that women living with HIV do 
not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV. 
Efavirenz may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and/or somnolence. Patients should be 
instructed that if they experience these symptoms, they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such 
as driving or operating machinery.

Summary of the safety profile 
Efavirenz has been studied in over 9,000 patients. In a subset of 1,008 adult patients who received 
600 mg efavirenz daily in combination with PIs and/or NRTIs in controlled clinical studies, the most 
frequently reported adverse reactions of at least moderate severity reported in at least 5% of patients 
were rash (11.6%), dizziness (8.5%), nausea (8.0%), headache (5.7%) and fatigue (5.5%). The most

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Immune system disorders 
uncommon 
notable adverse reactions associated with efavirenz are rash and nervous system symptoms. Nervous 
system symptoms usually begin soon after therapy onset and generally resolve after the first 2 - 4 
weeks. Severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme; psychiatric 
adverse reactions including severe depression, death by suicide, and psychosis like behaviour; and 
seizures have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. The administration of efavirenz with 
food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse 
reactions (see section 4.4). 
The long-term safety profile of efavirenz-containing regimens was evaluated in a controlled trial (006) 
in which patients received efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 412, median duration 
180 weeks), efavirenz + indinavir (n = 415, median duration 102 weeks), or indinavir + zidovudine + 
lamivudine (n = 401, median duration 76 weeks). Long-term use of efavirenz in this study was not 
associated with any new safety concerns. 
Adverse reactions of moderate or greater severity with at least possible relationship to treatment 
regimen (based on investigator attribution) reported in clinical trials of efavirenz at the recommended 
dose in combination therapy (n = 1,008) are listed below. Also listed in italics are adverse reactions 
observed post-marketing in association with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral treatment regimens.

‡These adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance but not reported as drug-
related events for efavirenz-treated patients in 16 clinical trials. The frequency category of "rare" was 
defined per A Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) (rev. 2, Sept 2009) on the 
basis of an estimated upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for 0 events given the number of 
patients treated with efavirenz in these clinical trials (n=3,969).

Rash
In clinical studies, 26% of patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz experienced skin rash compared 
with 17% of patients treated in control groups. Skin rash was considered treatment related in 18% of 
patients treated with efavirenz. Severe rash occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with efavirenz, 
and 1.7% discontinued therapy because of rash. The incidence of erythema multiforme or Stevens-
Johnson syndrome was approximately 0.1%. 
56
Psychiatric symptoms
Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first two 
weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz. In most patients rash resolves with continuing therapy with 
efavirenz within one month. Efavirenz can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of 
rash. Use of appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids is recommended when efavirenz is 
restarted.

Serious psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. In 
controlled trials, the frequency of specific serious psychiatric events were: 
Patients with a history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of these serious psychiatric 
adverse reactions with frequencies ranging from 0.3% for manic reactions to 2.0% for both severe 
depression and suicidal ideation. There have also been post-marketing reports of death by suicide, 
delusions, psychosis-like behaviour and catatonia. 
Experience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class 
is limited. Reported rates of recurrent rash following a switch from nevirapine to efavirenz therapy, 
primarily based on retrospective cohort data from published literature, range from 13 to 18%, 
comparable to the rate observed in patients treated with efavirenz in clinical studies. (See section 4.4.)

Nervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one or two days of therapy and generally 
resolve after the first 2 - 4 weeks. In a study of uninfected volunteers, a representative nervous system 
symptom had a median time to onset of 1 hour post-dose and a median duration of 3 hours. Nervous 
system symptoms may occur more frequently when efavirenz is taken concomitantly with meals 
possibly due to increased efavirenz plasma levels (see section 5.2). Dosing at bedtime seems to 
improve the tolerability of these symptoms and can be recommended during the first weeks of therapy 
and in patients who continue to experience these symptoms (see section 4.2). Dose reduction or 
splitting the daily dose has not been shown to provide benefit. 
In clinical controlled trials, frequently reported adverse reactions included, but were not limited to 
dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming. Nervous system 
symptoms of moderate-to-severe intensity were experienced by 19% (severe 2%) of patients compared 
to 9% (severe 1%) of patients receiving control regimens. In clinical studies 2% of patients treated 
with efavirenz discontinued therapy due to such symptoms. 
Analysis of long-term data showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset 
nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the 
control arm. 
Nervous system symptoms
Hepatic failure 
A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing 
hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, were characterized by a fulminant course, progressing 
in some cases to transplantation or death.

Immune Reactivation Syndrome
Osteonecrosis
Laboratory test abnormalities 
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have 
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur 
many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). 
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). 
Amylase: in the clinical trial subset of 1,008 patients, asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels 
greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were seen in 10% of patients treated with efavirenz 
and 6% of patients treated with control regimens. The clinical significance of asymptomatic increases 
in serum amylase is unknown. 
Liver enzymes: elevations of AST and ALT to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal 
range (ULN) were seen in 3% of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5-8% after long-
term treatment in study 006). Similar elevations were seen in patients treated with control regimens 
(5% after long-term treatment). Elevations of GGT to greater than five times ULN were observed in 
4% of all patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz and 1.5-2% of patients treated with control 
regimens (7% of efavirenz-treated patients and 3% of control-treated patients after long-term 
treatment). Isolated elevations of GGT in patients receiving efavirenz may reflect enzyme induction. 
In the long-term study (006), 1% of patients in each treatment arm discontinued because of liver or 
biliary system disorders. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Liver enzymes in hepatitis B or C co-infected patients: in the long-term data set from study 006, 
137 patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and 
84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening for 
hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) and/or C (hepatitis C antibody positive). Among co-infected 
patients in study 006, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13% of 
efavirenz-treated patients and in 7% of control, and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN 
developed in 20% and 7%, respectively. Among co-infected patients, 3% of those treated with 
efavirenz and 2% in the control arm discontinued because of liver disorders (see section 4.4). 
Undesirable effects in children were generally similar to those of adult patients. Rash was reported 
more frequently in children (59 of 182 (32%) treated with efavirenz) and was more often of higher 
grade than in adults (severe rash was reported in 6 of 182 (3.3%) of children). Prophylaxis with 
appropriate antihistamines prior to initiating therapy with efavirenz in children may be considered. .  
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors. ATC code: J05AG03 
Some patients accidentally taking 600 mg twice daily have reported increased nervous system 
symptoms. One patient experienced involuntary muscle contractions. 
Efavirenz is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Efavirenz is a non-competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse 
transcriptase (RT) and does not significantly inhibit HIV-2 RT or cellular DNA polymerases (α, β, γ or 
δ). 
Treatment of overdose with efavirenz should consist of general supportive measures, including 
monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient’s clinical status. Administration of activated 
charcoal may be used to aid removal of unabsorbed efavirenz. There is no specific antidote for 
overdose with efavirenz. Since efavirenz is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to remove 
significant quantities of it from blood.

The effect of efavirenz on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, positive and placebo 
controlled, fixed single sequence 3-period, 3-treatment crossover QT study in 58 healthy subjects 
enriched for CYP2B6 polymorphisms. The mean Cmax of efavirenz in subjects with CYP2B6 *6/*6 
genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days was 2.25-fold the mean Cmax 
observed in subjects with CYP2B6 *1/*1 genotype. A positive relationship between efavirenz 
concentration and QTc prolongation was observed. Based on the concentration-QTc relationship, the 
mean QTc prolongation and its upper bound 90% confidence interval are 8.7 ms and 11.3 ms in 
subjects with CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days 
(see section 4.5).
The free concentration of efavirenz required for 90 to 95% inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-
resistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell 
lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/monocyte cultures. 
The potency of efavirenz in cell culture against viral variants with amino acid substitutions at positions 
48, 108, 179, 181 or 236 in RT or variants with amino acid substitutions in the protease was similar to 
that observed against wild type viral strains. The single substitutions which led to the highest 
resistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 
(L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-fold 
resistance). Greater than 100-fold loss of susceptibility was observed against HIV variants expressing 
K103N in addition to other amino acid substitutions in RT. 
Antiviral activity 
Resistance 
59
Cross resistance 
K103N was the most frequently observed RT substitution in viral isolates from patients who 
experienced a significant rebound in viral load during clinical studies of efavirenz in combination with 
indinavir or zidovudine + lamivudine. This mutation was observed in 90% of patients receiving 
efavirenz with virological failure. Substitutions at RT positions 98, 100, 101, 108, 138, 188, 190 or 
225 were also observed, but at lower frequencies, and often only in combination with K103N. The 
pattern of amino acid substitutions in RT associated with resistance to efavirenz was independent of 
the other antiviral medicines used in combination with efavirenz. 
The potential for cross resistance between efavirenz and PIs is low because of the different enzyme 
targets involved. The potential for cross-resistance between efavirenz and NRTIs is low because of the 
different binding sites on the target and mechanism of action. 
Cross resistance profiles for efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine in cell culture demonstrated that the 
K103N substitution confers loss of susceptibility to all three NNRTIs. Two of three delavirdine-
resistant clinical isolates examined were cross-resistant to efavirenz and contained the K103N 
substitution. A third isolate which carried a substitution at position 236 of RT was not cross-resistant 
to efavirenz. 
Viral isolates recovered from PBMCs of patients enrolled in efavirenz clinical studies who showed 
evidence of treatment failure (viral load rebound) were assessed for susceptibility to NNRTIs. Thirteen 
isolates previously characterised as efavirenz-resistant were also resistant to nevirapine and 
delavirdine. Five of these NNRTI-resistant isolates were found to have K103N or a valine-to-
isoleucine substitution at position 108 (V108I) in RT. Three of the efavirenz treatment failure isolates 
tested remained sensitive to efavirenz in cell culture and were also sensitive to nevirapine and 
delavirdine.

Two controlled studies (006 and ACTG 364) of approximately one year duration with efavirenz in 
combination with NRTIs and/or PIs, have demonstrated reduction of viral load below the limit of 
quantification of the assay and increased CD4 lymphocytes in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and NRTI-
experienced HIV-infected patients. Study 020 showed similar activity in NRTI-experienced patients 
over 24 weeks. In these studies, the dose of efavirenz was 600 mg once daily; the dose of indinavir 
was 1,000 mg every 8 hours when used with efavirenz and 800 mg every 8 hours when used without 
efavirenz. The dose of nelfinavir was 750 mg given three times a day. The standard doses of NRTIs 
given every 12 hours were used in each of these studies. 
Study 006, a randomized, open-label trial, compared efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine or efavirenz 
+ indinavir with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine in 1,266 patients who were required to be 
efavirenz-, lamivudine-, NNRTI-, and PI-naive at study entry. The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 
341 cells/mm3 and the mean baseline HIV-RNA level was 60,250 copies/mL. Efficacy results for 
study 006 on a subset of 614 patients who had been enrolled for at least 48 weeks are found in Table 2. 
In the analysis of responder rates (the non-completer equals failure analysis [NC = F]), patients who 
terminated the study early for any reason, or who had a missing HIV-RNA measurement that was 
either preceded or followed by a measurement above the limit of assay quantification were considered 
to have HIV-RNA above 50 or above 400 copies/mL at the missing time points. 
Efavirenz has not been studied in controlled studies in patients with advanced HIV disease, namely 
with CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3, or in PI or NNRTI experienced patients. Clinical experience in 
controlled studies with combinations including didanosine or zalcitabine is limited.

 Study AI266922 was an open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and 
antiviral activity of SUSTIVA in combination with didanosine and emtricitabine in antiretroviral-naive 
and -experienced paediatric patients. Thirty-seven patients 3 months to 6 years of age (median 0.7 
years) were treated with SUSTIVA. At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.88 log10
copies/mL, median CD4+ cell count was 1144 cells/mm3, and median CD4+ percentage was 25%. The 
median time on study therapy was 132 weeks; 27% of patients discontinued before Week 48. Using an 
ITT analysis, the overall proportions of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL at 
Week 48 were 57% (21/37) and 46% (17/37), respectively. The median increase from baseline in 
CD4+ count at 48 weeks was 215 cells/mm3 and the median increase in CD4+ percentage was 6%. 
Study PACTG 1021 was an open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and 
antiviral activity of SUSTIVA in combination with didanosine and emtricitabine in paediatric patients 
who were antiretroviral therapy naive. Forty-three patients 3 months to 21 years of age (median 
9.6 years) were dosed with SUSTIVA. At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 
4.8 log10 copies/mL, median CD4+ cell count was 367 cells/mm3, and median CD4+ percentage was 
18%. The median time on study therapy was 181 weeks; 16% of patients discontinued before Week 
48. Using an ITT analysis, the overall proportions of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and 
<50 copies/mL at Week 48 were 77% (33/43) and 70% (30/43), respectively. The median increase 
from baseline in CD4+ count at 48 weeks of therapy was 238 cells/mm3 and the median increase in 
CD4+ percentage was 13%. 
Study PACTG 382 was an open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and 
antiviral activity of SUSTIVA in combination with nelfinavir and an NRTI in antiretroviral-naive and 
NRTI-experienced paediatric patients. One hundred two patients 3 months to 16 years of age (median 
5.7 years) were treated with SUSTIVA. Eighty-seven percent of patients had received prior 
antiretroviral therapy. At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.57 log10 copies/mL, median 
CD4+ cell count was 755 cells/mm3, and median CD4+ percentage was 30%. The median time on 
study therapy was 118 weeks; 25% of patients discontinued before Week 48. Using an ITT analysis, 
the overall proportion of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL at Week 48 
were 57% (58/102) and 43% (44/102), respectively. The median increase from baseline in CD4+ count 
at 48 weeks of therapy was 128 cells/mm3 and the median increase in CD4+ percentage was 5%.

Peak efavirenz plasma concentrations of 1.6 - 9.1 μM were attained by 5 hours following single oral 
doses of 100 mg to 1,600 mg administered to uninfected volunteers. Dose related increases in Cmax and 
AUC were seen for doses up to 1,600 mg; the increases were less than proportional suggesting 
diminished absorption at higher doses. Time to peak plasma concentrations (3 - 5 hours) did not 
change following multiple dosing and steady-state plasma concentrations were reached in 6 - 7 days. 
In HIV infected patients at steady state, mean Cmax, mean Cmin, and mean AUC were linear with 
200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg daily doses. In 35 patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily, steady 
state Cmax was 12.9 ± 3.7 μM (29%) mean ± S.D. (% C.V.), steady state Cmin was 
5.6 ± 3.2 μM (57%), and AUC was 184 ± 73 μM·h (40%). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Effect of food 
Absorption 
The AUC and Cmax of a single 600 mg dose of efavirenz film-coated tablets in uninfected volunteers 
was increased by 28% (90% CI: 22-33%) and 79% (90% CI: 58-102%), respectively, when given with 
a high fat meal, relative to when given under fasted conditions (see section 4.4). 
Distribution 
62
Efavirenz is highly bound (approximately 99.5 - 99.75%) to human plasma proteins, predominantly 
albumin. In HIV-1 infected patients (n = 9) who received efavirenz 200 to 600 mg once daily for at 
least one month, cerebrospinal fluid concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 1.19% (mean 0.69%) of the 
corresponding plasma concentration. This proportion is approximately 3-fold higher than the non-
protein-bound (free) fraction of efavirenz in plasma. 
Biotransformation 
Efavirenz plasma exposure may be increased in patients with the homozygous G516T genetic variant 
of the CYP2B6 isoenzyme. The clinical implications of such an association are unknown; however, 
the potential for an increased frequency and severity of efavirenz-associated adverse events cannot be 
excluded. 
Studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that efavirenz 
is principally metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system to hydroxylated metabolites with 
subsequent glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites. These metabolites are essentially 
inactive against HIV-1. The in vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major 
isozymes responsible for efavirenz metabolism and that it inhibited P450 isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and 
3A4. In in vitro studies efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 only at 
concentrations well above those achieved clinically. 
Efavirenz has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, resulting in the induction of its own 
metabolism, which may be clinically relevant in some patients. In uninfected volunteers, multiple 
doses of 200 - 400 mg per day for 10 days resulted in a lower than predicted extent of accumulation 
(22 - 42% lower) and a shorter terminal half-life compared with single dose administration (see 
below). Efavirenz has also been shown to induce UGT1A1. Exposures of raltegravir (a UGT1A1 
substrate) are reduced in the presence of efavirenz (see section 4.5, table 1). 
Although in vitro data suggest that efavirenz inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, there have been 
contradictory reports of both increased and decreased exposures to substrates of these enzymes when 
co-administered with efavirenz in vivo. The net effect of co-administration is not clear.

In a single-dose study, half-life was doubled in the single patient with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh Class C), indicating a potential for a much greater degree of accumulation.  A multiple-
dose study showed no significant effect on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) compared with controls.  There were insufficient data to determine 
whether moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) affects efavirenz 
pharmacokinetics. 
Efavirenz has a relatively long terminal half-life of at least 52 hours after single doses and 
40 - 55 hours after multiple doses. Approximately 14 - 34% of a radiolabelled dose of efavirenz was 
recovered in the urine and less than 1% of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged efavirenz. 
Although limited data suggest that females as well as Asian and Pacific Island patients may have 
higher exposure to efavirenz, they do not appear to be less tolerant of efavirenz. Pharmacokinetic 
studies have not been performed in the elderly.

Efavirenz induced foetal resorptions in rats. Malformations were observed in 3 of 20 foetuses/ 
newborns from efavirenz-treated cynomolgus monkeys given doses resulting in plasma efavirenz 
concentrations similar to those seen in humans. Anencephaly and unilateral anophthalmia with 
secondary enlargement of the tongue were observed in one foetus, microophthalmia was observed in 
another foetus, and cleft palate was observed in a third foetus. No malformations were observed in 
foetuses from efavirenz-treated rats and rabbits.

Biliary hyperplasia was observed in cynomolgus monkeys given efavirenz for ≥ 1 year at a dose 
resulting in mean AUC values approximately 2-fold greater than those in humans given the 
recommended dose. The biliary hyperplasia regressed upon cessation of dosing. Biliary fibrosis has 
been observed in rats. Non-sustained convulsions were observed in some monkeys receiving efavirenz 
for ≥ 1 year, at doses yielding plasma AUC values 4- to 13-fold greater than those in humans given the 
recommended dose (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Carcinogenicity studies in male mice, male and female rats were negative. While the carcinogenic 
potential in humans is unknown, these data suggest that the clinical benefit of efavirenz outweighs the 
potential carcinogenic risk to humans. 
Carcinogenicity studies showed an increased incidence of hepatic and pulmonary tumours in female 
mice, but not in male mice. The mechanism of tumour formation and the potential relevance for 
humans are not known.

SUSTIVA, which contains the active substance efavirenz, belongs to a class of antiretroviral 
medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It is an antiretroviral 
medicine that fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection by reducing the amount of 
the virus in blood. It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 months of age and older and 
weighing at least 3.5 kg.  
Your doctor has prescribed SUSTIVA for you because you have HIV infection. 
SUSTIVA taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in 
the blood. This will strengthen your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked 
to HIV infection.  
if any member of your family (parents, grandparents, brothers or sisters) has died suddenly due to 
a heart problem or was born with heart problems.  
if you have a heart condition, such as changes in the rhythm or rate of the heartbeat, a slow 
heartbeat, or severe heart disease.
if you are allergic  to efavirenz or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice. 
2.  What you need to know before you take SUSTIVA 
Do not take SUSTIVA 

if you have severe liver disease. 
if your doctor has told you that you have high or low levels of electrolytes such as potassium or 
magnesium in your blood.

Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before taking SUSTIVA 
 SUSTIVA must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If SUSTIVA 
is started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another 
medicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time. 
If you are taking any of these medicines, tell your doctor immediately. Taking these 
medicines with SUSTIVA could create the potential for serious and/or life-threatening side-
effects or stop SUSTIVA from working properly. 
bepridil (used to treat heart disease) 
cisapride (used to treat heartburn)

if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. Patients with 
chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher 
risk for severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct 
blood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another 
medicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take SUSTIVA (see section 2, Do not 
take SUSTIVA). 
if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with 
anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are 
taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant 
medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking SUSTIVA. Your 
doctor may give you a different anticonvulsant. 
if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol 
abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have 
strange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects). 
 You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking SUSTIVA. 

 Tell your doctor: 
 This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection, and you may continue to develop infections or other 
illnesses associated with HIV disease.  
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called prolongation 
of the QT interval. 
 Once you start taking SUSTIVA, look out for: 
87
- 
- 
signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or 
abnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment and 
usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. 
- 
- 
any signs of skin rash. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop 
taking SUSTIVA and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another 
NNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with SUSTIVA. 
bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a 
bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to 
the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be 
some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint 
stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in 
movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. 
any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection 
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation 
from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed 
that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, enabling 
the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.  
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs 
when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start 
taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may 
occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or 
other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and 
moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please 
inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

SUSTIVA may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba
extracts. As a result, the amounts of SUSTIVA or other medicines in your blood may be affected. This 
may stop the medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases, 
your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: 
Other medicines and SUSTIVA 
You must not take SUSTIVA with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take 
SUSTIVA, at the start of Section 2. They include some common medicines and an herbal remedy (St. 
John’s wort) which can cause serious interactions.

SUSTIVA with food and drink 
Taking SUSTIVA on an empty stomach may reduce the undesirable effects. Grapefruit juice should be 
avoided when taking SUSTIVA. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Women should not get pregnant during treatment with SUSTIVA, and for 12 weeks thereafter. 
Your doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting 
treatment with SUSTIVA.  
If you could get pregnant while receiving SUSTIVA, you need to use a reliable form of barrier 
contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or 
other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Efavirenz may remain in your blood 
for a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as 
above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking SUSTIVA.

Serious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with 
efavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during 
pregnancy. If you have taken SUSTIVA or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, 
and tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic 
tests to monitor the development of your child. 
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are 
pregnant, you should take SUSTIVA only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.

medicines (see Other medicines and SUSTIVA).  
SUSTIVA is for oral use. SUSTIVA is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach 
preferably at bedtime. This may make some side effects (for example, dizziness, drowsiness) 
less troublesome. An empty stomach is commonly defined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal.  
It is recommended that the capsule be swallowed whole with water. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
For children who are not able to swallow the capsules, the doctor may recommend opening the hard 
capsule and mixing the contents with a small amount (1-2 teaspoons) of food (e.g., yogurt ). The 
capsules must be opened carefully so that the contents do not spill or escape into the air. Hold the 
capsule with the cap facing up and pull the cap away from the body of the capsule. Use a small 
container for mixing. Give the mixture to the child as soon as possible, but no more than 30 minutes 
after mixing. Make sure the child eats the full amount of the mixture of food and capsule contents. 
Add another small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of the food to the empty mixing container, 
stirring to make sure there is no drug residue remaining in the container, and have the child eat the full 
amount again. The child should not be given any additional food for 2 hours. The doctor may also 
recommend this method of taking SUSTIVA for adults who cannot swallow capsules.

Possible side effects 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  
If you forget to take SUSTIVA 
Try not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose, take the next dose as soon as possible, but do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you need help in planning the best times to take your 
medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are 
caused by SUSTIVA or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease 
itself. 
If you stop taking SUSTIVA 
When your SUSTIVA supply starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is 
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a 
short time. The virus may then become harder to treat. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
The nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is first started, but generally decrease in 
the first few weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours 
after taking a dose. If you are affected your doctor may suggest that you take SUSTIVA at bedtime 
and on an empty stomach. Some patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the 
ability to think clearly. Some patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur 
more often in those who have a history of mental illness. Always notify your doctor immediately if 
you have these symptoms or any side effects while taking SUSTIVA. 
You should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most 
cases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with SUSTIVA. Rash was more 
common in children than in adults treated with SUSTIVA. 
The most notable unwanted effects reported with SUSTIVA in combination with other anti-HIV 
medicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms.

SUSTIVA, which contains the active substance efavirenz, belongs to a class of antiretroviral 
medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It is an antiretroviral 
medicine that fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection by reducing the amount of 
the virus in blood. It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 months of age and older and 
weighing at least 3.5 kg.  
Your doctor has prescribed SUSTIVA for you because you have HIV infection. 
SUSTIVA taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in 
the blood. This will strengthen your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked 
to HIV infection.  
    if any member of your family (parents, grandparents, brothers or sisters) has died suddenly due 
to a heart problem or was born with heart problems.  
    if you have a heart condition, such as changes in the rhythm or rate of the heartbeat, a 
slow heartbeat, or severe heart disease.

if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with 
anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are 
taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant 
medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking SUSTIVA. Your 
doctor may give you a different anticonvulsant. 
if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. Patients with 
chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher 
risk for severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct 
blood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another 
medicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take SUSTIVA (see section 2, Do not 
take SUSTIVA). 
if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol 
abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have 
strange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects). 
 SUSTIVA must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If SUSTIVA 
is started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another 
medicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time. 
 You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking SUSTIVA. 

 Tell your doctor: 
 This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection, and you may continue to develop infections or other 
illnesses associated with HIV disease.

signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or 
abnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment and 
usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. 
- 
- 
- 
any signs of skin rash. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop 
taking SUSTIVA and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another 
NNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with SUSTIVA. 
bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a 
bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to 
the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be 
some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint 
stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in 
movement. If you notice any of these symptoms, please inform your doctor. 
any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection 
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation 
from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed 
that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, enabling 
the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.  
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs 
when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start 
taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may 
occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or 
other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and 
moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please 
inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: 
Other medicines and SUSTIVA

If you could get pregnant while receiving SUSTIVA, you need to use a reliable form of barrier 
contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or 
other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Efavirenz may remain in your blood 
for a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as 
above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking SUSTIVA.  
Serious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with 
efavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during 
pregnancy. If you have taken SUSTIVA or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, 
and tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic 
tests to monitor the development of your child. 
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are 
pregnant, you should take SUSTIVA only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.

For children who are not able to swallow the capsules, the doctor may recommend opening the hard 
capsule and mixing the contents with a small amount (1-2 teaspoons) of food (e.g., yogurt ). The 
capsules must be opened carefully so that the contents do not spill or escape into the air. Hold the 
capsule with the cap facing up and pull the cap away from the body of the capsule. Use a small 
container for mixing. Give the mixture to the child as soon as possible, but no more than 30 minutes 
after mixing. Make sure the child eats the full amount of the mixture of food and capsule contents. 
Add another small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of the food to the empty mixing container,

Possible side effects 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are 
caused by SUSTIVA or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease 
itself. 
If you forget to take SUSTIVA 
Try not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose, take the next dose as soon as possible, but do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you need help in planning the best times to take your 
medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you stop taking SUSTIVA 
When your SUSTIVA supply starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is 
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a 
short time. The virus may then become harder to treat.

The nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is first started, but generally decrease in 
the first few weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours 
after taking a dose. If you are affected your doctor may suggest that you take SUSTIVA at bedtime 
and on an empty stomach. Some patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the 
ability to think clearly. Some patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur 
more often in those who have a history of mental illness. Always notify your doctor immediately if 
you have these symptoms or any side effects while taking SUSTIVA. 
You should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most 
cases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with SUSTIVA. Rash was more 
common in children than in adults treated with SUSTIVA. 
The most notable unwanted effects reported with SUSTIVA in combination with other anti-HIV 
medicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms.

SUSTIVA, which contains the active substance efavirenz, belongs to a class of antiretroviral 
medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It is an antiretroviral 
medicine that fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection by reducing the amount of 
the virus in blood. It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 months of age and older and 
weighing at least 3.5 kg.  
Your doctor has prescribed SUSTIVA for you because you have HIV infection. 
SUSTIVA taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in 
the blood. This will strengthen your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked 
to HIV infection.  
   if any member of your family (parents, grandparents, brothers or sisters) has died suddenly due 
to a heart problem or was born with heart problems.  
    if you have a heart condition, such as changes in the rhythm or rate of the heartbeat, a 
slow heartbeat, or severe heart disease.

if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with 
anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are 
taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant 
medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking SUSTIVA. Your 
doctor may give you a different anticonvulsant. 
if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. Patients with 
chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher 
risk for severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct 
blood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another 
medicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take SUSTIVA (see section 2, Do not 
take SUSTIVA). 
if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol 
abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have 
strange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects). 
 SUSTIVA must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If SUSTIVA 
is started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another 
medicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time. 
 You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking SUSTIVA. 

 Tell your doctor: 
 This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection, and you may continue to develop infections or other 
illnesses associated with HIV disease.

- 
signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or 
abnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment and 
usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. 
- 
- 
- 
any signs of skin rash. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop 
taking SUSTIVA and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another 
NNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with SUSTIVA. 
bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a 
bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to 
the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be 
some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint 
stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in 
movement. If you notice any of these symptoms, please inform your doctor. 
any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection 
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation 
from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed 
that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, enabling 
the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.  
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs 
when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start 
taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may 
occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or 
other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and 
moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please 
inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

SUSTIVA may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba
extracts. As a result, the amounts of SUSTIVA or other medicines in your blood may be affected. This 
may stop the medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases, 
your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: 
Other medicines and SUSTIVA 
You must not take SUSTIVA with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take 
SUSTIVA, at the start of Section 2. They include some common medicines and an herbal remedy (St. 
John’s wort) which can cause serious interactions.

avoided when taking SUSTIVA. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Women should not get pregnant during treatment with SUSTIVA, and for 12 weeks thereafter. 
Your doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting 
treatment with SUSTIVA.

If you could get pregnant while receiving SUSTIVA, you need to use a reliable form of barrier 
contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or 
other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Efavirenz may remain in your blood 
for a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as 
above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking SUSTIVA.  
Serious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with 
efavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during 
pregnancy. If you have taken SUSTIVA or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, 
and tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic 
tests to monitor the development of your child. 
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are 
pregnant, you should take SUSTIVA only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible
You should not breast feed your baby if you are taking SUSTIVA. 
Driving and using machines 
SUSTIVA contains efavirenz and may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and drowsiness.
If you are affected, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines.

SUSTIVA is for oral use. SUSTIVA is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach 
preferably at bedtime. This may make some side effects (for example, dizziness, drowsiness) 
less troublesome. An empty stomach is commonly defined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal.  
It is recommended that the capsule be swallowed whole with water.

capsules must be opened carefully so that the contents do not spill or escape into the air. Hold the 
capsule with the cap facing up and pull the cap away from the body of the capsule. Use a small 
container for mixing. Give the mixture to the child as soon as possible, but no more than 30 minutes 
after mixing. Make sure the child eats the full amount of the mixture of food and capsule contents. 
Add another small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of the food to the empty mixing container, 
stirring to make sure there is no drug residue remaining in the container, and have the child eat the full

4. 
Possible side effects 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are 
caused by SUSTIVA or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease 
itself. 
If you forget to take SUSTIVA 
Try not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose, take the next dose as soon as possible, but do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you need help in planning the best times to take your 
medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you stop taking SUSTIVA 
When your SUSTIVA supply starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is 
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a 
short time. The virus may then become harder to treat. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
The nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is first started, but generally decrease in 
the first few weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours 
after taking a dose. If you are affected your doctor may suggest that you take SUSTIVA at bedtime 
and on an empty stomach. Some patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the 
ability to think clearly. Some patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur 
more often in those who have a history of mental illness. Always notify your doctor immediately if 
you have these symptoms or any side effects while taking SUSTIVA. 
You should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most 
cases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with SUSTIVA. Rash was more 
common in children than in adults treated with SUSTIVA. 
The most notable unwanted effects reported with SUSTIVA in combination with other anti-HIV 
medicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms.

SUSTIVA, which contains the active substance efavirenz, belongs to a class of antiretroviral 
medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It is an antiretroviral 
medicine that fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection by reducing the amount of 
the virus in blood. It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 months of age and older and 
weighing at least 3.5 kg.  
Your doctor has prescribed SUSTIVA for you because you have HIV infection. 
SUSTIVA taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in 
the blood. This will strengthen your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked 
to HIV infection.

with SUSTIVA could create the potential for serious and/or life-threatening side-effects or stop  
SUSTIVA from working properly.

if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. Patients with 
chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher 
risk for severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct 
blood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another 
medicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take SUSTIVA (see section 2, Do not 
take SUSTIVA). 
if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with 
anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are 
taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant 
medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking SUSTIVA. Your 
doctor may give you a different anticonvulsant. 
if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol 
abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have

any signs of skin rash. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop 
taking SUSTIVA and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another

bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a 
bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to 
the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be 
some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint 
stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in 
movement. If you notice any of these symptoms, please inform your doctor. 
any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection 
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation 
from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed 
that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, enabling 
the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.  
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs 
when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start 
taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may 
occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or 
other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and 
moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please 
inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:

or pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor will give you instructions for proper dosing. 
The dose for adults is 600 mg once daily.  
The dose for SUSTIVA may need to be increased or decreased if you are also taking certain 
medicines (see Other medicines and SUSTIVA). 
SUSTIVA is for oral use. SUSTIVA is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach 
preferably at bedtime. This may make some side effects (for example, dizziness, drowsiness) 
less troublesome. An empty stomach is commonly defined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal. 
It is recommended that the tablet be swallowed whole with water. 
SUSTIVA must be taken every day.
SUSTIVA should never be used alone to treat HIV. SUSTIVA must always be taken in 
combination with other anti-HIV medicines.

If you stop taking SUSTIVA 
When your SUSTIVA supply starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is 
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a 
short time. The virus may then become harder to treat. 
If you forget to take SUSTIVA 
Try not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose, take the next dose as soon as possible, but do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you need help in planning the best times to take your 
medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are 
caused by SUSTIVA or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease 
itself. 
If you take more SUSTIVA than you should 
If you take too much SUSTIVA, contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. 
Keep the medicine container with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  
Possible side effects 
4. 
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. 
The most notable unwanted effects reported with SUSTIVA in combination with other anti-HIV 
medicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms.  
121
You should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most 
cases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with SUSTIVA. Rash was more 
common in children than in adults treated with SUSTIVA.

The nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is first started, but generally decrease in 
the first few weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours 
after taking a dose. If you are affected your doctor may suggest that you take SUSTIVA at bedtime 
and on an empty stomach. Some patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the 
ability to think clearly. Some patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur 
more often in those who have a history of mental illness. Always notify your doctor immediately if 
you have these symptoms or any side effects while taking SUSTIVA.

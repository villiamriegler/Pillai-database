contraindication ‘initiation of treatment in pregnancy’ 
The SmPC section 4.6 has been updated as follows:  
Pregnancy 
 A large amount of data (more than 1000 pregnancy 
outcomes) from interferon beta registries, national 
registries and post-marketing experience indicates no 
increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-
conception exposure or exposure during the first trimester 
of pregnancy. However, the duration of exposure during 
the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected 
when interferon beta use was contraindicated during 
pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when 
pregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with 
exposure during the second and third trimester is very

Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly 
increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The risk of 
spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to 
interferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated based on 
the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an 
increased risk so far. 
If clinically needed, the use of Betaferon may be considered 
during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon 
beta-1b into breast milk, together with the chemical / 
physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests 
that levels of interferon beta-1b excreted in human milk 
are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed 
newborn/infant are anticipated. 
Betaferon can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
No investigations on fertility have been conducted (see 
section 5.3). 
The PL has been updated accordingly.

interferons and thrombotic microangiopathy, and that the 
PI should be updated accordingly. Furthermore, the CHMP 
concurred that a warning about the risk of thrombotic 
microangiopathy, including recommendations for 
monitoring of early symptoms, prompt treatment and 
discontinuation of interferon beta products when the 
reaction occurs, should be added to the Product 
Information.

In order to adapt Betaferon Product Information to the 
the following adverse reactions identified during 
post-marketing surveillance: weight increased, 
menorrhagia, arthralgia, dizziness, vasodilatation, 
diarrhoea and the following terms which are 
described in section 4.4: capillary leak syndrome, 
hepatic injury and hepatic failure. Table 2 in section 
4.8 (i.e. adverse drug reaction listing based on 
reports from post marketing surveillance) was 
amended such that reaction frequencies are based 
on pooled clinical trial data. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
an editorial modification in Labelling and to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
Labelling and 
current Corporate Core Data Sheet, the MAH proposed to 
PL 
update section 4.8 of the SmPC with adding adverse 
reactions based on the post-marketing reporting. The CHMP 
considered the MAH´s assessment of causality for 
arthralgia, diarrhoea, dizziness, menorrhagia, 
vasodilatation and weight increased and concluded that 
adding these reactions into section 4.8 of the SmPC was 
justified, since these events were considered as “possibly 
related”. The CHMP was also of the view that “weight 
decreased” can be moved from section “Investigation” to 
section “Metabolism and nutrition disorder” and that the 
following terms: capillary leak syndrome, hepatic injury and 
hepatic failure, already captured in section 4.4, can also be 
listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Following a request from 
the CHMP, adverse reaction frequencies in table 2 were 
updated based on incidence rates of the pooled clinical trial

composed of two parts. First a 24 month two-armed, 
placebo-controlled randomised, double-blind part, then an

immediate (after the first clinical event) versus delayed 
(after development of clinically defined multiple sclerosis 
[CDMS], or 24 months after the first clinical event). Out of 
437 patients that qualified for the follow-up part, a total of 
418 patients entered the study.  
The 5-year integrated analysis showed a sustained efficacy 
of Betaferon treatment in patients with Clinically Isolated 
Syndrome (CIS) based on a significant delay in the 
progression to CDMS, whereas the other primary endpoints 
related to disability and quality of life failed to support the 
benefit of immediate vs. delayed treatment. The 
development of neutralising activity in patients during the 5 
year treatment was associated with a significant increase in 
newly active lesions and T2 lesion volume on magnetic 
resonance imaging. However, this did not seem to be 
associated with a reduction in clinical efficacy (with regard 
to time to CDMS, time to confirmed EDSS progression and 
relapse rate). The long-term safety data from this trial did 
not raise any specific concern. Based on the submitted data 
the CHMP approved amendments  to sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.1 of the SPC.

controlled, randomised BENEFIT study in patients with a 
single demyelinating event and the first year of the open 
label BENEFIT follow-up study. After 3 years, a pre-planned 
interim analysis showed that confirmed disability 
progression (measured by EDSS; confirmed increase in 
EDSS scale of greater than or equal 1.0 compared to 
baseline) occurred in 24% of the patients in the delayed 
treatment group compared to 16% in the immediate

of confirmed disability progression in the majority of 
patients receiving 'immediate' treatment.  Follow-up of 
patients is continuing in order to provide additional data. 
No benefit, attributable to Betaferon, in quality of life (as 
measured by FAMS - Functional Assessment of MS: 
Treatment Outcomes Index) was seen.

so far by the MAH in the paediatric multiple sclerosis 
population. The CHMP has reviewed published data on the 
use of interferon beta in paediatric patients, mostly in the 
range of 12 to 16 years of age. The information available 
on efficacy and safety of interferon beta in children is 
limited. Efficacy cannot be considered specifically 
demonstrated in children but there are no signals of specific 
safety issues in paediatric patients. Although the data are 
scarce, the CHMP recommended that the available 
information is reflected in the product information of all 
beta-interferons.

treatment of patients with a single demyelinating 
event with an active inflammatory process if it is 
severe enough to warrant treatment with 
intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses 
have been excluded, and if they are determined to 
be at high risk of developing clinically definite

generated by the variation. Furthermore, the 
package leaflet was amended accordingly.

This variation relates to the revision of section 4.2 of

01/06/2006 
SmPC and PL 
In order to evaluate the longer-term safety and efficacy of 
the SPC to reflect 5 year clinical data gathered in 
relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). In 
addition, this variation consists of changes to 
sections 4.3, 4.4,   4.6, 4.8 and 5.3 to align the SPC 
with the most updated company reference safety 
datasheet and with the SPC guideline. These changes 
notably include the downgrading of several contra-
indications and the consequential revision of the 
special warnings and precautions for use. The 
Package Leaflet has also been updated accordingly. 
IFNB-1b treatment of RRMS, the subjects enrolled in the 
original pivotal RRMS studies were given the choice of 
continuing their treatment, in a blinded fashion for up to 5 
years. Betaferon treated patients showed significant 
reduction in the number of relapses over the 5 year period 
with supportive magnetic resonance imaging data. Section 
4.2 of the SPC was  revised to reflect these 5 year data.  
The contra-indications in pregnancy, patients with a history 
of severe depressive disorders and/or suicidal ideation, any 
patients with epilepsy not adequately controlled by

treatment were also reviewed, with consequential 
amendments of sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6. As these 
contraindications are common to all interferons beta, the 
CHMP Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) 
performed a class review of all interferons beta authorised 
to provide recommendations on the need for and the 
nature of changes to the current contraindications. Based 
on the data submitted by the MAH (clinical trial, post-
marketing data and literature) and the PhVWP 
recommendations, the CHMP agreed on the following 
changes: 
- 
Removal of the absolute contraindication in 
patients with epilepsy not adequately controlled with 
treatment and revision of section 4.4 of the SPC to indicate 
that interferon beta should be used with caution in patients 
with epilepsy, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately 
controlled 
- 
Revision of the contraindication in pregnancy to 
indicate that initiation of treatment in pregnancy is 
contraindicated but leave some room for clinical judgement 
as to whether a patient who becomes pregnant while taking 
interferon beta should continue or stop treatment. 
Consequential changes were made to section 4.6 of the 
SPC. 
- 
Revision of the contraindication in patients with a 
history of severe depressive disorders and/or suicidal 
ideation, to indicate that treatment of patients with current

patients with a history of thyroid dysfunction. In 
addition, the MAH applied for a minor update of

"bilirubin increase". The Package Leaflet has been

data and literature provided by the MAH, the following 
warnings were added to section 4.4 of the SPC: 
“Thyroid function tests are recommended regularly in 
patients with a history of thyroid dysfunction or as clinically 
indicated. 
Asymptomatic elevations of serum transaminases, in most 
cases mild and transient, occurred very commonly in 
patients treated with Betaferon during clinical trials. As for 
other beta interferons, severe hepatic injury, including 
cases of hepatic failure, has been reported rarely in 
patients taking Betaferon. The most serious events often 
occurred in patients exposed to other drugs or substances 
known to be associated with hepatotoxicity or in the 
presence of comorbid medical conditions (e.g. 
metastasizing malignant disease, severe infection and 
sepsis alcohol abuse). 
Patients should be monitored for signs of hepatic injury.”

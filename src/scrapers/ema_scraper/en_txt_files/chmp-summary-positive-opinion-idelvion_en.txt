Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
IDELVION  
albutrepenonacog alfa 
On 25 February 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product IDELVION, 
intended for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with Haemophilia B. IDELVION was 
designated as an orphan medicinal product on 04 February 2010. The applicant for this medicinal product 
is CSL Behring GmbH. 
IDELVION will be available as 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU and 2000 IU Powder and solvent for solution for 
injection. The active substance of IDELVION is albutrepenonacog alfa, an antihaemorrhagic, blood 
coagulation factor IX, (ATC code: B02BD04). It works as replacement therapy and temporarily increases 
plasma levels of factor IX, helping to prevent and control bleeding. 
The benefits with IDELVION are its ability to stop the bleeding when given on demand and prevent 
bleeding when used as routine prophylaxis or for surgical procedures. The most common side effects are 
injection site reaction and headache. 
The full indication is: "the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with Haemophilia B 
(congenital factor IX deficiency)". Idelvion can be used in all age groups. It is proposed that IDELVION be 
prescribed by physicians experienced in the treatment of haemophilia B.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This post-licensure study has been requested by the Korean Food and Drugs Administration (KFDA) to 
GSK, to provide additional local clinical data on immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of the HRV 
vaccine.  The  design  is  a  placebo-controlled  clinical  trial  in  healthy  infants  in  Korea  to  evaluate  the 
immunogenicity,  reactogenicity  and  safety  of  HRV.  Two  oral  doses  of  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo  were 
administered starting at 6-12 weeks of age according to 0, 1-2 months schedule. 
Study  results  show  high  immunogenicity  results,  which  are  in  line  with  the  seroconversion  rates 
observed  in  studies  conducted  in  the  same  region  with  similar  setting.  The  safety  profile  was  similar 
between  the  HRV  vaccine  and  the  placebo  group,  and  the  frequency  of  Grade  3  solicited  and 
unsolicited AEs were low and in line with other studies. 
This paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Rotarix.  
No SmPC and PL changes are proposed.

Dose  (CCID50)  of  RIX4414  Live  Attenuated  HRV  strain  lyophilised  with  active  substance:  9  milligrams 
(mg) of sucrose, 18 mg of Dextran, 13.5 mg of sorbitol, 9 mg of amino acids, 2.25 mg of Dulbecco’s 
Modified  Eagle  Medium  (DMEM)  reconstituted  with  liquid  diluent  containing  60  mg  of  calcium 
carbonate,  2.5  mg  of  xanthan  and  1  mL  of  water  for  injection.  Lot  number  of  the  HRV  vaccine: 
DROTA024A, Lot numbers of the diluent: AD05A471C and AD05A598B. 
Clinical aspects 
1. Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report(s) for: 
-  Clinical Study Report for Study 112269 (Rota-068): Immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety 
study  to  evaluate  two  doses  of  the  lyophilised  formulation  of  the  human  rotavirus  (HRV) 
vaccine when administered to healthy Korean infants previously uninfected with HRV. 
This post-licensure study has been requested by the Korean Food and Drugs Administration (KFDA) to 
provide additional local clinical data on immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of the HRV vaccine, 
as the data in the pre-licensure study Rota-041 was considered insufficient due to the small number of 
subjects in the ATP cohort (N=72).  
2. Clinical study 
  Description 
This  Phase  IV,  double-blind  randomised  study  involved  two  parallel  treatment  groups  (HRV  vaccine 
immunogenicity,  reactogenicity  and  safety  of 
group  and  Placebo  group)  to  evaluate  the 
Rotarix

GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  Biologicals’  oral  live  attenuated  HRV  vaccine  in  healthy  infants  previously 
uninfected with HRV (see figure).  
The study was conducted in 19 centres in Korea, from 25 August 2009 to 23 July 2010. 
  Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
Primary: 
- 
Secondary: 
To demonstrate at least 40% increase in seroconversion rate, in the HRV vaccine group at 
Visit 3 (i.e. one month post-Dose 2) as compared to Placebo group. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
To  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  the  HRV  vaccine  in  terms  of  serum  anti  Rotavirus  (RV) 
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody concentrations at Visit 3 (i.e. one month post-Dose 2). 
To  assess  the  reactogenicity  of  HRV  vaccine  in  terms  of  occurrence  of  solicited  adverse 
events (AEs) within the 8-day follow-up period after each vaccine dose. 
To assess the safety of HRV vaccine in terms of occurrence of unsolicited AEs within a 31-
day follow-up period after any vaccine dose. 
To assess the safety of HRV vaccine in terms of serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout 
the study period. 
To assess the presence of RV in gastroenteritis (GE) stools collected up to Visit 3. 
To  evaluate  non-inferiority  in  terms  of  seroconversion  rate  from  the  Rota-068 
(112269/068) study as compared to that of the seroconversion rate observed in the Rota-
023 (444563/023) study. 
•  Study design 
The study was a Phase IV, double-blind, randomised (3:1), placebo controlled study with two parallel 
treatment groups (HRV  vaccine group and Placebo group). Two oral doses of  HRV  vaccine or placebo 
were administered starting at 6-12 weeks of age according to 0, 1-2 months schedule. Subjects were 
allowed to receive routine infant vaccines concurrently with the study vaccine. All concomitant vaccines 
received  were  to  be  recorded  in  the  electronic  Case  Report  Forms  (eCRF).  Blood  samples  were  to  be 
collected  from  all  the  subjects  at  Visit  1  and  Visit  3  and  stool  samples  were  to  be  collected  from 
subjects with report of GE between Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or Placebo and Visit 3. Data collection was 
done by Remote Data Entry (RDE) using eCRFs.

•  Statistical Methods 
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS® version-9.11 on Windows XP Professional 
and  StatXact-8.0  procedure  on  SAS®.  The  analyses  were  performed  as  planned  in  the 
protocol and reporting and analysis plan (RAP). The range was not calculated for height in cm 
and weight in kg per group and overall. 
Analysis of demographics 
V. 
The mean and standard deviation (SD) of height in centimetre (cm) and weight in kilograms 
(kg)  were  calculated  per  group  and  overall  at  Visit  1.  The  mean,  range  and  SD  of  age  in 
weeks  were  calculated  per  group  and  overall,  at  each  dose.  The  racial  and  gender 
composition, per group and overall were also presented. The distribution of subjects enrolled 
among the study centres was tabulated as a whole and per group. 
Analysis of immunogenicity 
VI. 
VII. 
- 
VIII. 
The primary analysis was based on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. 
For each treatment group, at each time point that a given antigen was measured: 
Seropositivity/ seroconversion rates, GMCs and their exact 95% CI were tabulated. 
The  asymptotic  standardised  95%  CI  for  difference  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  who 
seroconverted  for  anti-RV  IgA  antibody  concentrations  at  Visit  3  between  the  HRV  vaccine 
group and the Placebo group were computed. The primary objective was reached if the LL of 
the  two-sided  asymptotic  standardised  95%  CI  for  the  difference  in  seroconversion  rate 
between two treatments (HRV vaccine minus placebo) was ≥ 40%. Non-inferiority in terms of 
seroconversion  rate  observed  between  the  Rota-068  (112269/068)  study  and  the  Rota-023 
(444563/023)  study  was  reached  if  the  LL  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  for  the  difference  in 
seroconversion  rate  between  the  Rota-068  (112269/068)  study  and  (minus)  the  Rota-
023(444563/023) study was above -20%.

Analysis of safety 
IX. 
X. 
The primary analysis was based on the TVC. 
The overall incidence, with exact 95% CI, of any AEs (solicited or unsolicited) during the 8-
day  (Day  0-Day  7)  solicited  follow-up  period  was  tabulated  by  group,  for  each  dose,  for 
overall doses and per subject. The percentage of AEs reported by subjects within the 31-day 
(Day  0-Day  30)  follow-up  period  after  vaccination  with  its  exact  95%  CI  was  tabulated  by 
group.  The  incidence,  with  exact  95%  CI,  of  each  individual  solicited  general  AE,  was 
calculated by group, over the solicited follow-up period, after each dose, for all doses and per 
subject.  The  same  calculations  were  done  for  each  individual  solicited  general  AE  rated  as 
Grade 3 and for each individual solicited general AE related to the vaccination. The incidence, 
with exact 95% CI, of any Grade 2 or Grade 3 fever, vomiting or diarrhoea was calculated by 
group, over the solicited follow-up period, after each dose, for all doses and per subject. The 
verbatim  reports  of  unsolicited  AEs  were  reviewed  by  a  physician  and  the  signs  and 
symptoms  were  coded  according  to  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA). Every verbatim term was matched with the appropriate Preferred Term (PT). The 
percentage  of  subjects  with  unsolicited  AEs  occurring  within  the  31-day  (Day  0-Day  30) 
follow-up period with its exact 95% CI was tabulated by PT. Similar tabulation was done for 
vaccination  and  for  unsolicited  AEs  rated  as  Grade  3.  The  percentage  of  subjects  with 
presence  of  RV  in  GE  stool  samples  collected  from  Dose  1  of  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo  up  to 
Visit 3 was tabulated by group. The percentage of subjects reporting GE episodes from Dose 
1  of  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo  up  to  Visit  3  was  tabulated  by  group.  The  percentages  of 
subjects  who  received  at  least  one  concomitant  medication  during  the  8-day  (Day  0-Day  7) 
solicited  follow-up  period  after  vaccination  and  during  the  study  period  were  tabulated  by 
type of medication. SAEs reported during the study period were summarised by group.

The mean age of the subjects in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 8.8 weeks (range: 6 
to 12 weeks) at the time of the first dose of HRV vaccine or placebo and 16.2 weeks (range: 
10  to  24  weeks)  at  the  time  of  the  second  dose  of  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo.  Majority  of  the 
subjects (98.8%) were of East Asian heritage; 47.7% of the subjects were female and 52.3% 
of  the  subjects  were  male.  Demographic  characteristics  were  similar  in  the  two  groups 
(Rotarix and placebo). 
The  percentage  of  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  concomitant  vaccination  was  87.7% 
and 87.6% at Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo respectively, and 64.6% and 66% at Dose 2 
of HRV vaccine or placebo respectively. The proportion of subjects receiving each concomitant 
vaccine was relatively similar between the Rotarix and the placebo groups, but no statistical 
test was provided.

month  after  Dose  2  between  the  HRV  vaccine  group  and  (minus)  the  Placebo  group  was 
77.26%, which is above the pre-defined clinical limit of 40% (criteria specified for fulfilling the 
primary objective). 
The  LL  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  difference  in  the  seroconversion  rate  observed  in  the  Rota-068 
(112269/068) study and (minus) the Rota-023 (444563/023) study was 5.64% which is above 
the pre-defined clinical limit of-20% (criteria specified for fulfilling the secondary objective). 
•  Safety results (total vaccinated cohort):

XIV. 
The incidence of the overall symptoms (solicited or unsolicited) was 72.6% [95% CI: 68.5%; 
76.5%]  in  the  HRV  vaccine  group  and  76.7%  [95%  CI:  69.8%;  82.7%]  in  the  Placebo  group. 
There  was  no  increase  in  the  incidence of  the  symptoms  (solicited  or  unsolicited)  from  Dose  1 to 
Dose 2 of HRV vaccine or placebo. 
XV. 
Solicited AEs during the 8-day follow-up period: 
-  The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  Grade  2  or  Grade  3  solicited  symptoms  (fever, 
vomiting or diarrhoea) was 14.8% [95% CI: 11.8%; 18.2%] in the HRV vaccine group 
and 12.5% [95% CI: 8%; 18.3%] in the Placebo group. 
-  Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom in both the HRV 
vaccine  group  and  the  Placebo  group.  It  was  reported  for  47.4%  [95%  CI:  43%; 
51.9%] of the subjects in the HRV vaccine group and 50.6% [95% CI: 42.9%; 58.2%] 
of the subjects in the Placebo group after Dose 1 and 33.5% [95% CI: 29.2%; 38%] of 
the  subjects  in  the  HRV  vaccine  group  and  36.4%  [95%  CI:  29%;  44.3%]  of  the 
subjects in the Placebo group after Dose 2. 
-  Grade 3 solicited symptoms were reported for less than 2.8% of the subjects after each 
dose  in  both  groups.  Vomiting  was  the  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3  solicited 
symptom in both groups. 
-  Irritability  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  symptom  as  assessed  by  the 
investigator  to  be  causally  related to  the  vaccination  reported  after  each  dose in  both 
groups. 
XVI. 
Unsolicited AEs during the 31-day follow-up period after any vaccination: 
-  At least one unsolicited symptom was reported for 29.1% [95% CI: 25.2%; 33.3%] of 
the  subjects  in  the  HRV  vaccine  group  and  33.5%  [95%  CI:  26.6%;  41%]  of  the 
subjects  in  the  Placebo  group.  Nasopharyngitis  was  the  most  frequently  reported 
unsolicited symptom in both groups. 
XVII.  GE Episodes: 
-  The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  GE  episodes  from  Dose  1  of  HRV  vaccine  or 
Placebo  up  to  Visit  3  was  8.3%  in  the  HRV  vaccine  group  and  9.7%  in  the  Placebo 
group. 
-  None of the stool samples tested were positive for RV either with the vaccine strain or 
the wild type strain. 
XVIII.  SAEs: 
-  There were no fatal events reported in this study. 
-  Non-fatal  SAEs  were  reported  for  3.3%  of  the  subjects  in  the  HRV  vaccine  group  and 
7.4% of the subjects in the Placebo group from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo up to 
Visit 3. Bronchitis was the most frequently reported non-fatal SAE in both groups. None 
of  the  SAEs  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  study 
vaccination. 
-  One subject (subject no.672 in the HRV vaccine group) was withdrawn from the study 
due to an SAE-Malignant  Lymphoma. The decision to withdraw this subject was taken 
by both investigator and parents. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
The seroconversion rate observed for the HRV vaccine group in this study was 88.1% [95% CI: 84%; 
91.4%] at Visit 3, and is in line with the seroconversion rates observed in the studies conducted in the 
same region with similar setting. The primary objective for this study was met, as the LL of the 95% CI 
Rotarix 
P46 064 
Page 6/7 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
for the treatment difference (HRV vaccine and (minus) placebo) was above the pre-defined clinical limit 
of 40%. 
One  of  the  objectives  in  this  study  was  to  evaluate  non-inferiority  in  terms  of  seroconversion  rate 
observed in this study as compared to that of the seroconversion rate observed in the Rota-023 study. 
This  objective  was  met  since  the  LL  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  difference  in  the  seroconversion  rate 
between this study and (minus) the Rota-023 (444563/023) study was above the pre-defined clinical 
limit of-20%. 
The reactogenicity profiles of the HRV vaccine and the placebo in terms of occurrence of any, Grade 3 
or related AEs were similar. There was no clinically meaningful difference observed in the incidence of 
unsolicited AEs and SAEs  between both the groups. The safety data observed in this  study  were also 
similar  to  that  of  the  Rota-041  study  with  irritability  being  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited 
symptom  after each  dose and  the  frequency  of  the  Grade  3  solicited  and  unsolicited  AEs  were  low  in 
both the studies. There were no fatal SAEs reported in both studies.  
Among the subjects who reported GE; none of the stool samples tested positive for RV either with the 
vaccine strain or the wild type strain. These findings seem surprising since most pre-licensure studies 
of  HRV  using  ELISA  found  that  approximately  50%  of  infants  shed  vaccine  strain  after  the  first  dose 
(range 35–80%, depending on the dose and study parameters).1,2 The peak time of HRV shedding has 
not been well assessed but it begins to decrease between 7 and 15–21 days after vaccination. There 
might be two explanations for the absence of HRV strain in the stools of vaccinated subjects: 
- 
Stools  were  only  tested  if  gastro-enteritis  (GE)  was  present;  these  GE  episodes  may  have 
occurred after the first 7 days post-vaccination, when HRV shedding is less frequent. The MAH 
has provided no aggregate data on the GE timing, besides the time between doses and visits. 
-  Of all the GE episodes reported in the HRV vaccine group, stool results were not available for 
31.4% of the GE episodes, as either the stool samples were not collected or the stool samples 
were collected but the results were not available. Results were thus available for only 35 stool 
samples in the HRV group. 
However, no explanation is provided in the report since the MAH is not discussing this finding. 
Overall, the results of this study provides evidence that GSK Biologicals’ HRV vaccine is immunogenic, 
well tolerated and displays a good safety profile in a population of infants in Korea.

RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
  Overall conclusion 
This  placebo-controlled  clinical  trial  of  HRV  vaccine  among  infants  in  Korea  showed  high 
immunogenicity  results,  which  are  in  line  with  the  seroconversion  rates  observed  in  the  studies 
conducted  in  the  same  region  with  similar  setting.  The  safety  profile  was  similar  between  the  HRV 
vaccine  and  the  placebo  group,  and  the  frequency  of  Grade  3  solicited  and  unsolicited  AEs  were  low 
and in line with other studies.  
This  paediatric  study  does  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for  Rotarix.  No  SmPC  and  PL  changes  are 
proposed and there is no regulatory action. 
  Recommendation  
No further action is required.

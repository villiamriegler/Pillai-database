SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR TECARTUS (AUTOLOGOUS 
ANTI-CD19-TRANSDUCED CD3+ CELLS) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Tecartus. The RMP details important 
risks of Tecartus, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Tecartus’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Tecartus’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Tecartus should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Tecartus should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Tecartus’s RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What is it Used for 
Tecartus is authorized for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell 
lymphoma (MCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy including a Bruton’s tyrosine 
kinase (BTK) inhibitor and for the treatment of adult patients 26 years of age and above with 
relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (see SmPC for the 
full indication). It contains autologous anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)19-transduced CD3+ 
cells as the active substance and it is given as a single infusion product for autologous and 
intravenous use only. 
Further information about the evaluation of Tecartus’s benefits can be found in Tecartus’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage link to the EPAR summary landing page: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tecartus. 
II. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of Tecartus, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Tecartus’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
 
In the case of Tecartus, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed (eg, via the periodic safety update report [PSUR]) so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Tecartus is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Tecartus are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Tecartus. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
Tecartus has been assigned the legal status of a medicine subject to medical prescription in the 
European Union (EU), whereby therapy must be administered in a qualified clinical setting, and 
be initiated by a doctor experienced in the management of haematological malignancies (as 
described in section 4.2 of the SmPC).

Serious Neurologic Events including Cerebral Edema 
Although neurologic toxicity/immune effector cell-associated 
neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is associated with KTE-X19, the 
mechanisms underlying the neurologic events remain unclear. 
Results of ZUMA-2 showed that 68% of the subjects experienced 
neurologic events, with 33% of the subjects experiencing grade 3 or 
higher neurologic events. No subject experienced a Grade 5 
neurologic event. Results of ZUMA-3 showed that 68% of the 
subjects experienced neurologic events, with 32% experiencing 
grade 3 or higher neurologic events. One subject had a grade 5 event 
of brain herniation. 
Multiple groups have found anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T 
cells (CAR T) and CD14+ myeloid cells in the cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) of patients, and elevated interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the CSF 
have been observed in patients experiencing neurotoxicity {Brudno 
2016a}. Correlative analyses were performed for Cohort 1 of 
ZUMA-2 only. The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level in 
blood was 8.27-fold higher in subjects with Grade 3 or higher 
neurologic events relative to the median peak level in subjects with 
Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic events (361.50 versus 43.71 
cells/μL; nominal p = 0.0001). Of the 17 key analytes statistically 
evaluated, the median peak serum levels for the following analytes 
were higher (nominal Wilcoxon rank-sum p value ≤ 0.05) among 
subjects who experienced Grade 3 or higher neurologic events 
versus Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic events after infusion of 
KTE-X19: granzyme B, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-6, IL-
10, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and granulocyte macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). 
In ZUMA 2, compared with subjects ≥65 years of age, subjects <65 
years of age had a similar incidence of neurologic events (70% vs 
67%). Compared with males, females had a higher incidence of 
serious neurologic events (50% vs 28%). The majority of subjects 
were male (68 subjects, 83%), which limits the interpretation of 
these results. 
Compared with subjects who had a baseline Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, subjects who had 
a performance status of 1 had a ≥ 10% higher incidence of Grade 3 
or higher neurologic events (45% vs 25%), and serious neurologic 
events (39% vs 27%). 
In ZUMA-3, compared with subjects ≥65 years of age, subjects <65 
years of age had a numerically lower incidence of neurologic events 
(73% vs 67%). Males and females had a similar incidence of 
neurologic events (69% vs 67%).    
Compared with subjects who had a baseline ECOG performance 
status of 0, subjects who had a performance status of 1 had a 
numerically lower incidence of Grade 3 or higher neurologic events 
(28% vs 41%), and serious neurologic events (24% vs 34%).

Risk factors and risk

Cytokine Release Syndrome 
Cytokine release syndrome is induced by activated anti-CD19 CAR 
T cells after engagement with the CD19 target and may involve a 
generalised and reversible inflammatory process. In ZUMA-2, 91% 
of the subjects experienced CRS; 15% had severe CRS. In ZUMA-3, 
91% of subjects experienced CRS; 25% had severe CRS. CRS is 
considered an important identified risk due to its frequency and 
seriousness and the potential for severe outcomes if left untreated. 
Patient factors 
In some reports, the severity of CRS and elevation of serum 
cytokines have been related to disease burden, with higher disease 
burden predicting more toxicity presumably because this leads to 
higher levels of T-cell activation {Almasbak 2016, Brudno 2016a}. 
 
Maude et al. reported that the baseline disease burden (the 
percentage of blast cells in bone marrow before infusion) correlated 
with the severity of the CRS; a higher disease burden was 
significantly associated with severe CRS (P =0.002) {Maude 2014}. 
CRS associated with adoptive T-cell therapies has been consistently 
associated with elevated IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, and 
increases in IL-2, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-8, IL-5, and fractalkine 
{Davila 2014, Grupp 2013, Kalos 2011, Kochenderfer 2012}. 
In ZUMA-2, compared with subjects who were < 65 years old, 
subjects who were ≥ 65 years old had a higher incidence of Grade 3 
or higher CRS (19% versus 8%).   
The majority of subjects were male (68 subjects, 83%), which limits 
interpretation of gender comparative analysis. However, compared 
to male subjects, females had a ≥ 10% higher incidence of KTE-X19 
Grade 3 or higher CRS (43% versus 9%).   
Compared with subjects who had a baseline ECOG performance 
status of 0, subjects who had a performance status of 1 had a higher 
incidence of Grade 3 or higher CRS (16% versus 14%).  
In ZUMA-3, compared to subjects who were < 65 years old, subjects 
who were ≥ 65 years old had a numerically higher incidence of 
Grade 3 or higher CRS (33% versus 24%). Compared to male 
subjects, females had a numerically higher incidence of KTE X19 
Grade 3 or higher CRS (29% versus 22%). Subjects with a baseline 
ECOG performance status of 0 and subjects with a baseline ECOG 
performance status of 1 had a numerically comparable incidence of 
Grade 3 or higher CRS (24% versus 25%). 
CRS has been known to be associated with end organ dysfunction 
(e.g., hepatic, renal, cardiac, pulmonary). Worsening of underlying 
organ pathologies can occur in the setting of CRS. In addition, 
haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/ macrophage activation 
syndrome may occur in the setting of CRS.

groups 
Risk Minimization 
Measure(s) 
Cytopenias are consistent with the known toxicities of the 
conditioning regimen of chemotherapy. In addition, KTE-X19 may 
cause myelosuppression by a cytokine mediated mechanism. In 
ZUMA-2, 85%, 66%, and 70% of the subjects had neutropenia, 
anaemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively; 84%, 51% and 51% of 
these cases were Grade 3 or higher, respectively. 56%, 50% and 
48% of subjects experienced neutropenia, anemia and 
thrombocytopenia respectively; 56%, 46%, and 43% of these cases 
were Grade 3 or higher respectively. There were no reported adverse 
events of aplastic anaemia. Cytopenias are considered important 
identified risk due to their frequency, seriousness and severity which 
could lead to important clinical manifestations such as infection or 
bleeding. 
A systematic review of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy 
showed that older age, poor performance status, female gender, 
comorbidities, and low body mass index are risk factors for the 
development of febrile neutropenia {Lyman 2014}. The risk of 
febrile neutropenia increases in direct proportion to the severity and 
duration of neutropenia {Lyman 2010}. Bone marrow involvement 
was found to be a risk factor for chemotherapy induced neutropenia 
and fever {Kitay-Cohen 1996}.

Risk  
Infections 
 
 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Infections, especially serious infections, are consistent with the 
known toxicities of the conditioning regimen of chemotherapy. In 
addition, KTE-X19 can cause depletion of B-cells. In ZUMA-2, 
56% of the subjects had any infection, regardless of grade. In 
ZUMA-3, 44% of subjects had any infection, regardless of grade. 
Infections are considered important identified risk due to their 
frequency, seriousness and severity if left untreated. Thus, further 
evaluation of frequency, severity, seriousness and outcome of this 
risk in the post-marketing period is warranted. 
Factors that predispose to infection are divided into those that are 
host associated and those that are treatment associated.  
Patient factors 
Host-associated factors include underlying immune deficiencies, 
medical comorbidities, past infections, poor nutritional status, and 
psychological stress. The type of malignancy and status of the 
malignancy (i.e., active or in remission) are important factors in 
determining infection risk. Patients with acute lymphoma who are 
neutropenic, either due to their underlying disease or due to 
cytotoxic chemotherapy, are at risk for a different set of infections 
than those who are not neutropenic {Zembower 2014}. 
Additive or synergistic factors 
Treatment-associated factors include surgery, radiation, 
immunosuppressant therapies, antimicrobial use, and invasive 
procedures are important factors in the risk of infections {Zembower 
2014}.

Hypogammaglobulinaemia 
 
 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Hypogammaglobinemia is caused by B-cell aplasia. In ZUMA-2, 
16% of the patients experienced hypogammaglobinemia.At Month 3, 
the first time point at which B cells were measured after KTE-X19 
infusion in Cohort 1 subjects, median B-cell levels declined to 
0.090% (range: 0.017% to 96.147%). Median B-cell levels 
demonstrated recovery by Month 18 in evaluable subjects (median: 
10.624%, range: 3.967% to 15.992%).In ZUMA-3, 7 subjects (7%) 
experienced hypogammaglobulinaemia. Hypogammaglobinemia is 
considered an important identified risk due to the risk of infections if 
left untreated. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Prior treatment with rituximab and concomitant use of other drugs 
(e.g., steroids) that can induce hypogammaglobulinaemia.

Secondary Malignancy 
Secondary malignancy is consistent with the known outcomes of 
immunosuppression and/or genotoxicity resulting from 
chemotherapy. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are 
known to be at risk for developing secondary malignancies 
{Smeland 2016, Tward 2006}. Secondary malignancy is serious, 
potentially life-threatening and would require medical intervention 
and hence it is an important potential risk. 
Patient factors 
Age is a risk factor for secondary malignancy {Andre 2004, Moser 
2006}. A meta-analysis showed that NHL patients experience a 
higher risk for secondary malignant neoplasms than the general 
population (pooled relative risk of 1.88 overall and 1.32 for solid 
tumors) {Pirani 2011}. 
Additive or synergistic factors 
Use of any type of chemotherapy alone was associated with higher 
risk for secondary malignant neoplasms. A similar result was 
 
observed in the sub-analysis on patients treated only with alkylating 
agents, while the pooled relative risk of secondary malignant 
neoplasms for patients who underwent treatment with 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone 
(CHOP) or CHOP-like or radiotherapy alone was raised but not 
statistically significant. A combined modality of treatment was 
significantly associated with the risk for overall secondary malignant 
neoplasms but not for solid tumors {Pirani 2011}.

Immunogenicity 
Antibodies can reduce the efficacy of KTE-X19 and can cause safety 
issues like anaphylaxis, CRS, infusion reactions etc. that may require 
medical intervention and hence it is an important potential risk. 
Immunogenicity was identified by the development of 
antibodies that tested positive for reactivity against the murine 
monoclonal antibody FMC63 (parent antibody for the single-chain 
variable region fragment [scFv] used for production of the anti-
CD19 CAR in KTE-X19) as measured by enzyme linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). No KTE-X19 related confirmed 
cases of immunogenicity were seen in ZUMA-2 in this cell-based 
assay. In ZUMA-3, 2 subjects were confirmed to have antibodies to 
the anti-CD19 CAR after KTE-X19 infusion. One of these subjects 
was confirmed to be antibody-positive after retreatment with 
KTE-X19.

important potential risk due to the risk of genotoxicity that may lead 
to secondary malignancy. Thus, further evaluation in the post-

TLS 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
TLS occurs as a result of massive tumour cell death and thus it is 
consistent with the potential effects of conditioning chemotherapy 
and KTE-X19 treatment. 
In ZUMA-2, 1 subject had Grade 3 tumour lysis syndrome that was 
assessed as non-serious and related to KTE-X19. In ZUMA-3, 2 
subjects had a Grade 3 event of TLS. One event was assessed to be 
serious and unrelated to KTE-X19, and one was assessed as 
nonserious and related to KTE-X19. 
TLS is considered an important potential risk due to the seriousness 
of the condition.

Aggravation of GvHD 
The evidence of GvHD or aggravation of GvHD after administration 
of engineered CAR T cells in patients with a previous allogenic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) is limited. As noted 
previously, Kochenderfer et al reported results from a study using 
donor derived leukocytes (from prior allo-HSCT donor) expressing a 
CD19 CAR to patients with persistent B-cell malignancies following 
allo-HSCT {Kochenderfer 2013}; updated data presented by Brudno 
et al {Brudno 2016b} demonstrated that of 20 patients with either B-
cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or NHL, no patients developed acute 
GvHD and 2 patients developed chronic GvHD after CAR T-cell 
infusion. In another clinical study, however, 2 patients with relapsed 
or refractory B-ALL who received allogeneic CD19 CAR T cells 
developed GvHD 3 to 4 weeks after CAR T-cell infusion. One 
patient presented with grade 2 liver GvHD, whereas the other 
developed grade 2 skin and liver GvHD. One of these patients died 
of relapse 8 weeks after T-cell infusion, whereas the other developed 
a hematologic complete response as well as partial regression of 
extramedullary leukemic disease {Dai 2015}. Maude et al {Maude 
2014}, Lee et al {Lee 2015}, and Park et al {Park 2018} reported on 
the administration of recipient derived CAR T cells for patients with 
relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or NHL 
and observed no GvHD following CD 19 CAR T infusion {Smith 
2018}. It is important to note that subjects with a history of 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation were excluded from the ZUMA-
2 study. Subjects were eligible for participation in ZUMA-3 if they 
had relapsed/refractory disease after allo-SCT provided it had been 
at least 100 days from transplant at the time of enrollment and they 
had been off immunosuppressive medications for at least 4 weeks 
prior to enrollment. 
 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk Minimization 
Measure(s) 
As GvHD can be life threatening or cause chronic comorbidities, it 
is considered an important potential risk. 
Patients who had undergone a prior allo-HSCT and then received

be at an increased risk of developing aggravation of GvHD or 
GvHD.

Committee for medicinal products for human use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
RoActemra 
tocilizumab 
On 22 April 2010 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product RoActemra. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Roche 
Registration Limited. They may request a re-examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they 
notify the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the 
opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows2: 
RoActemra, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of moderate to 
severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have either responded inadequately to, or 
who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. In these patients, RoActemra can be given as 
monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate. 
RoActemra has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured 
by X-ray and to improve physical function when given in combination with methotrexate. 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the commission decision, which will normally be issued 
within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion. 
2 The text in bold represents the new or the amended indication.

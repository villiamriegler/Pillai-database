SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1.  Introduction 
Human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  infection  is  currently  the  most  common  sexually  transmitted  disease 
worldwide. By 5 years after sexual debut, ~50% of young women will have been infected with at least 
one of the 40 HPV types that preferentially infect the genitals. Thirteen of these HPV types are highly 
carcinogenic. Although a consistent picture of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of genital infections 
in  women  has  developed  during  the  past  two  decades,  less  is  known  about  these  infections  in  men. 
However, studies suggest a similar infection pattern in men, who are the most important vectors for 
transmission of HPV disease to women. The peak incidence of HPV infection occurs in young adults 
between the ages 16 and 23 years.  
Human  papillomaviruses  are  double-stranded  DNA  viruses  that  infect  epithelial  cells  and  are 
significantly associated with low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), genital condyloma and 
cervical cancer. HPVs are judged to be the primary cause of cervical cancer, which is the second most 
common  type  of  cancer  causing  deaths  in  women  worldwide.  Other  HPV-related  cancers  in  young 
women  include  vulvar  and  vaginal  cancers,  which  are  preceded  by  dysplastic  lesions  (vulvar 
intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN). In men anal cancer is the 
most  common  HPV-related  cancer.  The  virus  is  also  related  to  penile  and  certain  oropharyngeal 
cancers.  Other  benign  HPV-associated  conditions  include  condyloma  acuminata  (genital  warts) 
located  in  the  genital  or  perianal  region  and  juvenile  recurrent  respiratory  papillomatosis  (JRRP) 
primarily located in the larynx. JRRP is thought to occur by transmission of the virus from an infected 
mother to her child. 
HPV  types  are  classified  into  different  categories  based  on  their  association  with  cancer  in  humans. 
Epidemiological studies on the prevalence of HPV types in cervical cancer show some geographical 
differences. However, all over the world the majority of cervical cancers are related to two types, HPV 
16 (~55%) and HPV 18 (~15%). The contributions of HPV 16 and HPV 18 to high-grade CIN and to 
HPV-related vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers are similar to those found in cervical cancer. HPV 6, 11, 
16  and  18  together  cause  ~35%  of  CIN  1  cases.  HPV  6  and  HPV  11  cause  approximately  90%  of 
genital warts and RRP and 10% and 20% of CIN 1 lesions, respectively, but are not associated with 
cervical or anal carcinoma. These data provide the basis for the selection of the four HPV types 6, 11, 
16 and 18 in the current HPV vaccine.  
Mechanism of action 
There are no animal models for human papillomavirus infection. In animal models vaccination with LI 
Virus-like  Particles  (VLPs)  derived  from  species-specific  papillomaviruses  protected  against 
acquisition of infection and disease. Successful passive transfer experiments have also been performed 
suggesting that type-specific antibody responses are virus-neutralizing. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine 
was developed based on these animal data that suggest that a systemic neutralizing anti-HPV response 
by  vaccination  with  type-specific  HPV  L1  VLPs  result  in  protective  immunity  against  type-specific 
HPV infection and disease.  
The  vaccine  also  elicits  cell-mediated  responses  as  detected  by  in  vitro  stimulation  of  PBMCs,  Th1 
and Th2 cytokines and immunoglobulin subclasses. The LI responses are not expressed in the cellular 
department and therefore it is not expected CTLs will assist in vaccine-induced protective immunity. 
The  induced  T-cell  responses  may  play  an  important  role  in  establishing  long-lived  B-cell  immune 
memory. 
The exact role of various immune mechanisms in the protective efficacy of the HPV L1 VLP vaccine 
remains to be determined. It is believed that the vaccine provides protection by inducing type-specific 
antibodies that interfere with transmission by binding to and neutralizing contaminating HPV prior to 
entry into basal cells.  
Sanofi  Pasteur  MSD  SNC  submitted  a  Marketing  Authorization  Application  for  Gardasil  in 
accordance with Article 8.3(i) of Directive 2001/83/EC as a complete application.

The  approved  indications  are  as  follows:  “Gardasil  is  a  vaccine  for  the  prevention  of  high-grade 
cervical dysplasia (CIN 2/3), cervical carcinoma, high-grade vulvar dysplastic lesions (VIN 2/3), and 
external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 
6, 11, 16 and 18. The indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Gardasil in adult females 
16  to  26  years  of  age  and  on  the  demonstration  of  immunogenicity  of  Gardasil  in 9- to 15-year old 
children and adolescent. Protective efficacy has not been evaluated in males”. 
2. Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Gardasil  contains  virus-like  particles  (VLPs)  of  the  recombinant  major  capsid  (L1)  protein  of  HPV 
types 6, 11, 16, and 18 as active substance. The recombinant proteins forming the VLPs are produced 
by separate fermentation in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae. VLPs of each type are adsorbed 
on  amorphous  aluminium  hydroxyphosphate  sulfate  adjuvant,  and  the  formulation  also  includes 
sodium chloride, L-histidine, polysorbate 80, sodium borate, and water for injection. The final product 
is  presented  as  a  sterile  suspension  either  in  a  single-dose  vial  or  in  a  prefilled  syringe  for 
intramuscular injection.   
Active Substance  
The drug substance consists of the four Monovalent Bulk Adsorbed Products (MBAPs), one for each 
of the four human papillomavirus (HPV) types included in the final product. The active components in 
each MBAP are virus-like particles (VLPs) made up of the recombinant major capsid (L1) protein for 
that HPV type, produced in recombinant S. cerevisiae. L1 is the major structural protein of the human 
papillomavirus viral capsid.  
Native papillomavirus virions have an icosahedral symmetry consisting of 72 pentamers of L1 protein, 
and  are  nearly  spherical  with  an  approximate  diameter  of  60 nm.  The  pentamers  are  stabilized  by 
intra-  and  inter-L1  disulfide  bonds,  and  there  is  also  evidence  of  interpentamer  disulfide  bonds 
stabilizing the capsid. The HPV VLPs mimic the structure of the virion capsid.  
•  Manufacture 
Genetic Development  
The  pGAL110  yeast  expression  vector  was  used  for  expression  of  all  four  HPVL1  proteins.  
Differences in the cell substrates among the HPV types were introduced when cloning the particular 
HPVL1  open  reading  frame  (ORF),  when  inserting  the  ORF  into  the  pGAL110  vector,  and  when 
transforming  the  yeast  host  strain  with  the  resulting  vector.    Plasmid  or  phage  libraries  were 
constructed from DNA obtained from human clinical specimens or cell lines positive for HPV types 6, 
11, 16, or 18.  The L1 genes were derived by a direct cloning protocol.  However, the coding sequence 
for HPV11L1 was synthetically rebuilt based on HPV6L1 nucleotide sequences that supported good 
VLP  expression  in  yeast  and  that  were  appropriately  changed  to  encode  the  HPV11L1  polypeptide.  
Following  sub-cloning  of  either  the  whole  HPV  genomes  or  parts  thereof  into  standard  cloning 
vectors, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to subclone the L1 genes into the yeast expression 
vector  pGAL110,  which  contains  the  divergent  yeast  GAL1-GAL10  promoter  and  the  yeast  ADH1 
terminator (ADH1t) for transcription termination and polyadenylation.     
The pGAL110-related yeast expression vectors for each of the four HPV types were used to transform 
spheroplasts of the recombinant S. cerevisiae. Transformations were conducted independently for each 
of the HPV types by a published method.    
Based on analyses of HPV VLP expression productivity, one high-producing isolate of each type was 
selected as the source seed for preparation of a premaster seed.

Four  cell  substrates  were  derived  from  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae,  which  were  transformed  by 
pGAL110  based  yeast  expression  vectors,  each  containing  the  gene  of  interest  coding  for  HPVL1 
types 6, 11, 16, or 18 respectively.  A clone for each type was selected to establish the four MCBs.  
All cGMP master seed stocks were prepared using a two-stage expansion.  Optical density, pH, and 
residual dextrose were monitored to assure consistency of growth among all cGMP seed stocks.   
A  series  of  characterization  tests  have  been  performed  on  the  MCB  to  verify  culture  purity,  species 
identity, host strain identity, viable count, plasmid identity and integrity by restriction mapping, DNA 
sequencing of the L1-encoding genes and junctions, and specific productivity. 
Working Cell bank (WCB)
Master seed vials are used to inoculate the HPV Shakeflask Medium.  Future working seeds will be 
manufactured using the same process steps and similar equipment used for the original working seed.  
Following freezing, seed supplies are stored at ≤-60 °C.  
End of Production Cells (EOP) 
The  genetic  stability  has  been  analysed  for  one  full-scale  fermentation  for  each  type  of  end  of 
production  cells  (culture  purity,  species  identity,  host  strain  identity,  restriction  endonuclease 
mapping, plasmid retention and DNA sequencing).   
Fermentation 
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  drug  substance  consists  of  two  main  steps:  1)  fermentation  and 
harvest  of  the  recombinant  yeast  cell  slurry,  and  2)  purification  of  the  VLPs  and  adsorption  of  the 
purified VLPs onto aluminium-containing adjuvant to form the MBAP. 
The fermentation process consists of a seed fermentation and a production fermentation. 
During the seed fermentation process all HPV types use the same Seed Fermentation Medium. Culture 
growth  and  dextrose  utilization  are  monitored.  Upon  completion  of  this  stage,  the  seed  culture  is 
transferred to the production fermentor, which contains the HPV Production Fermentation Medium. 
Following  fermentation,  the  cells  are  then  harvested  by  microfiltration  to  produce  the  cell  slurry, 
which is dispensed and frozen for storage.  
Purification 
The downstream processing is initiated by thawing the frozen cell slurry and releasing the VLPs from 
yeast cells by homogenization/microfiltration run. The cell lysates are then incubated. The VLPs are 
purified by cross-flow membrane filtration, chromatography and ultrafiltration.   The final steps in the 
purification  process  for  all  four  types  are  buffer  exchange  and  sterile  filtration  to  produce  the  final 
aqueous  product  (FAP).  The  FAP  for  each  type  is  then  adsorbed  onto  amorphous  aluminium 
hydroxyphosphate  sulfate  to  produce  the  MBAP.  The  MBAP  for  each  type  is  then  filled  into  bulk 
storage containers and stored at 2-8°C. 
The amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate adjuvant used in the manufacture of the MBAP 
is manufactured Merck & Co. at the same site as the drug substance. The adjuvant is manufactured by 
adding sodium hydroxide to a solution of aluminium potassium sulfate and collecting the precipitate.  
Process control and validation  
The validation studies were executed according to prospectively approved protocols.  
Selection of Critical process parameter (CPP) and Critical quality attribute (CQA) and their respective 
ranges  were  established  based  on  data  at  lab,  pilot,  and  full  scale,  including  data  from  laboratory 
experiments specifically designed to test process parameter ranges. Some of the CPPs and CQAs were 
later defined as “critical controls”. 
Separate validation studies for filters and column sanitization and reuse are presented. Validation of 
the  aseptic  processing  is  described.  Bulk  media  challenges  have  been  performed  by  simulating  all 
steps in the manufacturing of the MBAP, including holding times, after the sterile filtration. After the 
initial  qualification  consisting  of  three  consecutive  media  challenges,  the  aseptic  process  is  re-
qualified by one yearly media challenge.

Manufacturing process development 
Initial  clinical  trials  focused  on  monovalent  Type  11  or  16  VLP  vaccines,  because  Type  11  had  the 
only  known  assay  for  neutralising  antibody  and  type  16  is  the  HPV  type  predominantly  associated 
with cervical cancer. Type 6 and 18 VLPs were added later.  
Process  development  proceeded  in  parallel  with  clinical  development,  culminating  in  the  Final 
Manufacturing  Processes  (FMPs),  which  were  validated.  Most  clinical  trials  of  the  quadrivalent 
vaccine  (trials  No.  011,  012,  015,  016,  and  018)  used  the  final  manufacturing  process  for  both 
fermentation and purification.  
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics 
Testing  was  carried  out  on  the  Final  Aqueous  Product  (FAP),  Monovalent  Bulk  Adsorbed  Product 
(MBAP), and in some cases, intermediate. The characterization testing was performed on a minimum 
of three full-scale lots per HPV type for each assay. 
Monomers were analyzed by peptide map (LysC + AspN) followed by MALDI-MS, Reduced SDS-
PAGE  (intact  monomer),  Isoquant  (deamidation),  free  thiol  groups,  circular  dichroism,  and  FT-IR 
spectroscopy.  Size  exclusion  chromatography  was  used  to  analyse  oligomers  of  L1  proteins.  No 
evidence has been found of N-linked glycosylation. 
Virus-like  particles  were  analyzed  by  CD  and  FT-IR  spectroscopies,  Transmission  Electron 
Microscopy  (TEM),  Cryo-electron  microscopy  (cryoEM),  Dynamic  Light  Scattering  (DLS),  epitope 
mapping,  inhibitory  concentration  at  50%  response  (IC50)  by  competitive  ELISA  and  affinity  of 
monoclonal Antibody (mAb) to the different epitopes.  
Epitope  mapping  was  performed  on  the  different  HPV  types  prior  assembly  and  after  reassembly 
(FAP)  using  a  surface  plasmon  resonance  (SPR)  technique  with  a  panel  of  monoclonal  antibodies 
(mAbs) that recognizes conformational or linear epitopes.   
Adsorbed VLPs (MBAP) were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), mouse potency, 
and  In-Vitro  Relative  Potency  (IVRP).  It  has  been  concluded  that  adsorption  to  the  aluminium 
adjuvant does not result in significant changes in VLPs structure.  
The  mouse  potency  assay  was  performed  on  BALB/c  mice  in  which  anti-HPV  antibodies  were 
measured using an ELISA based assay four weeks post-immunisation. This in vivo potency assay was 
used  to  establish  the  immunogenicity  of  MBAP  in  mice  and  the  assay  was  used  to  release  early 
clinical lots and to characterise the stability of MBAP. 
The  IVRP  assay  is  the  proposed  potency  assay  for  release.  It  is  a  sandwich-type  ELISA  used  to 
measure the antigenicity of drug substance and was shown to be specific for the four types. 
Impurities   
Non-L1  protein  impurities  originated  from  yeast  host  cells  were  analyzed  by  SDS-PAGE,  Western 
blot,  and  protease  activity.  These  assays  are  typically  performed  on  FAP.    Purity  results  show 
successive clearance of protein impurities through the process.  
•  Specification  
The tests applied for release of the cell slurry are as follows: culture purity and host strain ID.  
The release specifications for drug substance (MBAP) include tests for protein concentration, percent 
purity  (SDS-PAGE),  percent  intact  monomer  (SDS-PAGE),  in  vitro  relative  potency  (ELISA), 
identity,  sterility,  endotoxin,  aluminium  and  pH.  Satisfactory  validation  of  the  analytical  procedures 
has been performed in accordance with current ICH guidelines. 
The drug substance batch analysis was provided for at least 4 batches of each type produced with the 
final manufacturing process.  The tests parameters applied are the ones retained in the drug substance 
specification, completed with the analysis of polysorbate 80 for FAP, and completeness of adsorption, 
freezing point, mouse potency and calculated protein concentration for MBAP.

The proposed IVRP limits are based on the variability of the manufacturing process and the variability 
of the analytical method, and they represent the lower bounds on IVRP values expected to be observed 
at release under routine manufacturing and testing conditions.  
The reference standard used for the routine IVRP testing is a batch of drug product (quadrivalent final 
container product: QFCP) stored at 2-8 °C. In addition to this working standard, four FAPs, one per 
type, have been implemented as primary standards and stored at -60°C.     
•  Stability 
Stability studies were performed on cell slurry (one batch per type) and three full-scale lots of MBAP 
per  type  under  long-term  storage  conditions  (2-8 °C)  and  on  MBAP  under  accelerated  conditions  at 
23-27 °C. An additional study was initiated using one lot of MBAP per type manufactured by the full 
manufacturing  process.  Results  of  stability  studies  performed  on  cell  slurry  support  the  proposed 
holding time for cell slurry when stored frozen.  
For  the  MBAP,  results  are  provided  on  three  lots  per  HPV  type  stored  at  2−8 °C.  No  change  in 
physical appearance, pH, or completeness of adsorption is observed. A certain degree of variability is 
observed  by  IVRP,  mouse  potency  and  percent  intact  monomer,  but  no  clear  and  consistent 
degradation trend was observed for all types.  
All tests in the release specification for drug substance were included in the stability studies, except 
for protein concentration, percent purity, identity, and aluminium. In addition, the following tests were 
included: physical appearance, completeness of adsorption, and mouse potency. 
Finished Product  
The vaccine is a sterile liquid suspension prepared from the Type 6, Type 11, Type 16, and Type 18 
Monovalent Bulk Adsorbed Products (MBAPs) combined with a histidine buffer and a suspension of 
the  aluminium-containing  adjuvant.  It  is  filled  into  single-dose  vials  or  syringes  with  a  minimum 
recoverable volume of 0.5 mL.  
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
Formulation development 
The early clinical studies were made with monovalent vaccines, however, the majority of the studies 
on quadrivalent vaccine (011, 012, 015, 016, 018) were all made with the final formulation described 
in this application. 
The choice of adjuvant was based on preclinical studies showing that vaccine formulations containing 
this  adjuvant  induce  substantially  higher  anti-HPV  responses  than  vaccine  formulations  without 
adjuvant.  The  other  excipients  and  their  respective  concentrations  were  selected  based  on  stability 
considerations. 
Manufacturing process development 
The most significant changes to the manufacturing process were changes to the filling process from a 
manual  to  an  automated  process  (Type  6  study,  Protocol  004)  and  introducing  the  quadrivalent 
formulation  (Quadrivalent  study,  Protocol  007).  Only  minor  modifications  were  made  upon  transfer 
from the research pilot facilities to full manufacturing scale. 
There are no overages. An overfill is provided to ensure that a minimum recoverable volume of 0.5 
mL/dose is achieved. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process consists of two main steps: formulation and aseptic filling. 
The  Quadrivalent  Bulk  Adsorbed  Product  (QBAP)  formulation  is  prepared  from  six  sterile 
ingredients:  histidine  buffer,  adjuvant  diluent,  and  the  four  MBAPs  (Types  6,  11,  16,  and  18).  The 
5/40 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
QBAP  is  then  mixed  to  ensure  homogeneity,  aseptically  sampled  to  test  sterility  and  aluminium 
concentration.  The  portable  formulation  tank  is  maintained  under  positive  pressure  before  it  is 
transferred to the appropriate fill line for subsequent filling.  
Aseptic filling and stoppering of QFCP in vials or syringes occurs in a barrier isolator system. Before 
filling,  homogeneity  is  ensured  by  mixing  the  QBAP  by  agitation  and  recirculation.  The  QBAP  is 
aseptically filled into vials or syringes such that each vial or syringe contains a minimum recoverable 
volume of 0.5 ml. After each vial or syringe is filled, it exits the isolator and is inspected for defects. 
Quality  control  samples  for  in  vitro  relative  potency  (IVRP),  identity,  sterility,  pH,  endotoxin, 
aluminium,  package  identity,  and  recoverable  volume  are  taken  during  the  fill.  After  inspection,  the 
vials are placed into trays and stored at 2-8°C until they are labeled and packaged.  
Process Controls and validation 
For the purpose of process validation, six formulation lots were manufactured to prepare three lots of 
QFCP in vials and three lots of QFCP in syringes. All validation lots satisfied the validation criteria 
and met all release tests for both QBAP and QFCP. 
Control of Excipients 
The  vaccine  contains  the  following  excipients:  amorphous  aluminium  hydroxyphosphate  sulfate 
adjuvant, sodium chloride, L-histidine, polysorbate 80, sodium borate and water for injection. 
The  adjuvant  amorphous  aluminium  hydroxyphosphate  sulfate  is  a  non-compendial  insoluble 
aluminium  based  precipitate  to  which  the  VLPs  are  adsorbed.  This  adjuvant  has  been  used  in  HPV 
VLP vaccine clinical lots and in four other licensed vaccines manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. 
All  other  excipients  comply  with  the  Ph.Eur.  None  of  the  excipients  are  of  animal  origin,  and  no 
animal-derived materials are used in the manufacture of any excipient. 
•  Product Specification  
The specifications for drug product include tests for in vitro relative potency (IVRP, same assay as for 
drug  substance),  identity,  sterility,  endotoxin,  aluminium,  pH,  package  identity,  recoverable  volume 
and syringeability (syringes only). 
The  acceptance  criteria  for  IVRP  at  release  and  end-expiry  for  the  drug  product  take  into  account 
process capability, as well as assay variability and stability data. The results from a clinical substudy 
of Protocol 016 (designed to place in context these limits with respect to immunogenicity) support the 
proposed limits, all of which are the lowest dose evaluated in clinical trials. 
An upper IVRP specification for individual type is not proposed; a limit has been established for the 
Total  IVRP  and  is  a  safety  limit  derived  from  the  highest  dose  used  in  clinical  studies  (Clinical 
Protocol 007).  
Batch analysis data for both the Quadrivalent Bulk Adsorbed Product (QBAP) and the Quadrivalent 
Final Container Product (QFCP) in vials and in syringes are provided and analyzed according to the 
drug product specification. 
The reference standard used for routine testing is a quadrivalent final container product (QFCP) lot, 
which  is  referred  to  as  the  working  standard.  The  same  standard  is  used  for  both  IVRP  and 
completeness of adsorption. The same reference standard is used to test the drug substance lots. 
•  Stability of the Product  
The proposed shelf-life for both container type is considered acceptable. No difference in the product 
stability  profile  has  been  observed  among  the  different  final  contained  images,  including  both  vials 
and  syringes.  No  change  in  physical  appearance,  sterility,  endotoxin,  pH,  or  completeness  of 
adsorption is anticipated during the proposed shelf-life.  
A  photostability  study  was  performed  to  assess  the  stability  of  the  drug  product  to cool, white light 
and UV radiation.

•  Adventitious Agents 
Nonviral Adventitious Agents (TSE aspects) 
D-galactose, which is used in the fermentation culture medium, is the only raw material identified as 
being of ruminant origin using in the manufacturing process. D-galactose is obtained from bovine milk 
sourced  from  healthy  animals  in  the  same  manner  as  milk  for  human  consumption,  and  no  other 
ruminant material are used in its production. It is thus compliant with the EMEA Note for Guidance on 
Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  via  Human  and 
Veterinary  Medicinal  Products  (EMEA/410/01  rev 2,  July 2004).  Other  materials  used  in  the

2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
There is no animal model for human papillomavirus infection, however there are other species-specific 
papillomaviruses  that  have  been  studied  in  animal  models.  Cottontail  rabbit  papillomavirus  (CRPV) 
induce tumours, which are cutaneous rather than mucosal. Canine oral papillomavirus (COPV) infects 
and  induces  lesions  at  a  mucosal  site  (oral  mucosa).  These  studies  with  species-specific 
papillomaviruses have demonstrated the possibility to vaccinate against infection and development of 
tumour lesions using virus-like particles formed by recombinant viral capsid proteins (Breitburd et al 
1995, Jansen et al 1995, Suzich et al 1995) and have been used as models for vaccine development. 
African  green  monkeys  were  immunised  with  HPV-11  VLPs.  Sera  from  immunised  monkeys 
neutralised HPV-11 in an ex vivo model for HPV infection (human foreskin tissue was infected with 
HPV  and  then  implanted  into  athymic  mice).  Significant  levels  of  HPV-11-neutralising  antibodies 
were observed in cervicovaginal secretions (Lowe et al 1997). 
GLP 
Pharmacology  studies  were  not  performed  under  GLP  conditions.  All  5  toxicology  studies  were 
carried out under GLP conditions.   
Pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
A series of studies which were performed to determine the immunogenicity of the monovalent HPV 6, 
11,  16  and  18  L1  VLP  vaccines  and/or  the  quadrivalent  HPV  6,  11,  16  and  18  L1  VLP  vaccine 
(Gardasil) in non-human primates were submitted. The monovalent L1 VLP and quadrivalent Gardasil 
vaccine  formulations  tested  in  these  studies  were  made  by  the  same  manufacturing  process  as  the 
GMP  lots  and  are,  therefore,  similar  to  lots  that  were  used  in  the  clinic.  Monovalent  HPV  VLP 
vaccines  or  Gardasil  were  administered  by  intramuscular  injection  on  3  or  4  occasions  during  the 
course  of  52  weeks  followed  by  an  immunogenicity  assessment  of  antibody  titres  raised  against  the 
relevant  HPV  types.  Studies  were  conducted  in  rhesus  macaques,  chimpanzees,  and  African  Green 
monkeys. 
In each of the 3 non-human primate species tested, the intramuscular administration of Gardasil, or it’s 
monovalent components, was found to elicit immune responses resulting in production of antibodies 
against  the  HPV  VLP  types  present  in  the  vaccine.  These  studies  showed  that  Merck’s  aluminium 
adjuvant  is  necessary  to  induce  an  increased  immune  response  against  the  vaccine  antigens.  Serum

antibodies to all 4 HPV types were shown to neutralize pseudovirus infection of a cervical carcinoma 
cell line (C33A) indicating the potential of HPV VLP vaccines to protect against HPV infection. High 
titres  of  total  IgG  are  induced  in  addition  to  noteworthy  IgA  levels  and measurable IgM, IgG1, and 
IgG4. The isotype of the antibodies were indicative of a TH2 response.

Safety  pharmacology  studies  were  not  performed.  However  in  the  toxicological  studies  safety  daily 
monitoring  for  physical  signs  did  not  reveal  any  notable  respiratory  problems.  This  approach  is  in 
accordance  with  Note  for  guidance  on  preclinical  pharmacological  and  toxicological  testing  of 
vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95). 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Such  studies  are  not  required  according  Note  for  guidance  on  preclinical  pharmacological  and 
toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95). 
Pharmacokinetics 
Experimental studies to demonstrate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the active 
ingredients in Gardasil have not been performed for any of the component viruses. This is in line with 
testing  of  vaccines 
Note  for  guidance  on  preclinical  pharmacological  and 
(CPMP/SWP/465/95).    
toxicological 
The  Merck  Aluminium  Adjuvant  (aluminium  hydroxyphosphate  sulphate  adjuvant)  is  used  in  other 
vaccines,  which  are  approved  in  Europe,  and  it  is  agreed  that no further studies on the adjuvant are 
required according Guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use (CHMP/VEG/134716/2004). 
Toxicology 
•  Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose  toxicity  of  Gardasil  was  assessed  in  2  GLP  studies  in  mice  and  rats.  The  dose 
administered intramuscular represents approximately 1200-fold excess in mice and 300-fold excess in 
rats of the human dose. The vaccine was well tolerated and there were no treatment-related effects on 
mortality, physical signs, or body weight over a 14-day observation period. 
•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
A 10-week repeat-dose toxicity study was performed in BALB/c mice. Vaccine-treated mice received 
1 or 3 doses of Gardasil at a concentration of 160/160/80/160 μg/ml of the HPV types 6/11/16/18 L1 
VLPs. Control mice received 1 or 3 doses of Merck’s aluminium adjuvant placebo control. For each 
dose, approximately 50 μl of the vaccine or placebo control was administered. On a body weight basis, 
the dose of the vaccine administered to mice was approximately 1450-fold the projected human dose. 
All animals were dosed with either vaccine or placebo on Day 1. Necropsy was performed at day 8, 
29, 57 and 60.   
There  were  no  treatment-related  changes  in  physical  signs,  body  weight  gain,  food  consumption, 
haematology,  or  serum  biochemistry.  There  was  a  treatment-related  enlargement  of  the  iliac  lymph 
nodes.  Treatment-related  microscopic  changes  were  noted  in  lymph  nodes  (hyperplasia)  and  in  the 
muscle  at  the  injection  sites  (inflammation).  Despite  the  slightly  increased  severity  of  the  cellular 
infiltration  in  the  muscle  in  some  vaccine-injected  animals,  the  overall  damage  at  the  injection  sites 
was not more severe in these animals as compared to controls. 
•  Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were conducted, and this is in line with CPMP/SWP/465/95.

•  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted, and this is in line with CPMP/SWP/465/95. 
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
The reproductive and developmental toxicity was assessed in a study in female Sprague-Dawley rats 
addressing all phases of reproduction and foetal development.  
An immune response to the vaccine was observed, and antibodies were shown to be transferred to the 
offspring during gestation and also lactation. There were no adverse findings in the study. 
•  Local tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed by intramuscular administration of the vaccine in rabbits. Intramuscular 
administration  of  Gardasil  caused  minimal  irritation  at  injection  site  and  the  changes  observed  were 
similar  in  severity  to  those  produced  by  the  injection  of  the  Merck  aluminium  adjuvant  as  placebo 
control. 
•  Other toxicity studies 
Two  non-GLP  exploratory  immunogenicity  studies  were  performed  in  rats.  The  purpose  of  these 
studies  was  to  confirm  that  Gardasil  induced  an  immune  response  in  the  animal  model  used  for 
reproductive and developmental toxicology testing. 
There  were  no  deaths  or  treatment-related  physical  signs  during  the  study.  All  animals  mounted 
specific antibody responses to all 4 HPV VLPs. The immune response was consistent with a typical 
prime-boost effect. The highest HPV type-specific antibody titres were observed with a regimen which 
included 3 initial administrations of the vaccine, 3 weeks apart, followed by a fourth administration 10 
weeks after the third dose. 
A second exploratory immunogenicity study was carried out in order to confirm the immune response 
in rats. In both exploratory studies, it was demonstrated that the vaccine was immunogenic in rats and 
that an anti-HPV antibody response was seen for each HPV type present in the vaccine. These results 
show that the rat is an appropriate animal model for investigating the potential toxic effects related to 
administration of Gardasil. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
It is anticipated that the environmental impact of the Gardasil vaccine would be minimal to none for 
the following reasons: 
(cid:190) The  vaccine  is  comprised  of  Virus-like  Particles  (VLPs)  and  therefore  does  not  contain  any 
live or attenuated virus. The VLPs are simply protein sub-units found in the virus capsid. 
(cid:190) The VLP vaccine is not capable of replicating. Therefore, there is no risk of transmission from 
an immunised host to a susceptible host. 
(cid:190) The  VLP  vaccine  is  specific  for  humans  and  will  not  impact  the  organisms  of  a  sewage 
treatment plant or the effluent receiving stream. 
The environmental risk assessment has shown that there is no environmental risk associated with the 
use of Gardasil. 
4. Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The clinical development programme to support licensure of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine consisted 
of  12  clinical  studies.  Approximately  21,514  subjects  (11,813  HPV  vaccine/9,701  placebo)  were 
included and vaccinated.  
Initial phase I/IIa studies evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of monovalent vaccine precursors 
in  3,160  study  subjects.  Monovalent  HPV  11  LI  VPL  vaccine  was  evaluated in one study (Protocol 
9/40 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
001), HPV 16 L1 VPL vaccine in four studies (Protocols 002, 004, 005 and 012) and HPV 18 L1 VPL 
vaccine in one study (Protocol 006). Anti-HPV responses were followed up for 1.5 to 3.5 years. 
The quadrivalent HPV vaccine programme was divided into 2 sets of studies based on the age range of 
enrolled subjects: 1) efficacy studies were performed in female subjects 16 to 26 years of age and 2) 
studies to bridge efficacy, immunogenicity and safety in 16- to 23-year old female subjects to younger 
age  cohorts.  Seven  phase  II/III  studies  evaluated  the  quadrivalent  HPV  L1  VLP  vaccine  (Protocols 
007, 011, 012, 013, 015, 016 and 018). Protocols 011 and 012 were sub-studies of Protocol 013. 
(cid:190) Immunogenicity  of  the  quadrivalent  HPV  vaccine  was  evaluated  in  Protocols  007  (dose 
selection study), 011 (concomitant hepatitis B vaccine), 012 (monovalent HPV 16 bridging), 
015V1  (consistency  lots),  016V1  (adolescent  bridging), 016V2  (end-expiry  dose)  and  018 
(preadolescent /adolescent) and involved a total of 12,345 subjects.  
(cid:190) Efficacy  was  assessed  in  4  randomised  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies  including  a  total 
number of 20,541 subjects. There were two phase II studies, 005 (n=2,391) that evaluated the 
HPV  16  component  and  007  (n=551)  that  evaluated  the  quadrivalent  HPV  (types  6,  11,  16, 
18) LI VPL vaccine. The two pivotal phase III studies, termed FUTURE (Female United To 
Unilaterally  Reduce  Endo/Ectocervical  Disease)  I  (Protocol  013;  n=5,442)  and  FUTURE  II 
(Protocol 015; n=12,157) evaluated the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the prevention of HPV 
6/11/16/18-related CIN/external genital lesions (EGLs) and HPV 16- or HPV 18-related CIN 
2/3 or AIS (Cervical Adenocarcinoma In situ), respectively. The efficacy trials recruited 16- to 
26-year-old adolescent and young adult women, who were mostly HPV naïve, but were at risk 
for HPV infection. The Phase II and Phase III studies did not have screening phases; women 
were enrolled regardless of their baseline HPV status and Pap test (Papanicolau’s test) result.  
(cid:190) Safety  of  the  different  HPV  vaccine  formulations  has  been  evaluated  in  a  total  of  16,041 
subjects. Of these 11,813 received quadrivalent HPV vaccine and the remaining monovalent 
vaccine  formulations.  All  studies  were  placebo  controlled  and  the  total  population  that 
received placebo included 9,701 subjects (the placebo was aluminium adjuvant in all studies 
except  study  018  (pre-/adolescent  safety  study)  which  used  a  non-aluminium-containing 
placebo). 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic  studies  were  not  performed  in  accordance  with  the  Note  for  guidance  on  clinical 
evaluation of new vaccines (CPMP/EWP/463/97). 
Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of the vaccine relate to its interaction with the immune system. Therefore, this 
section will discuss the data on the systemic immune response to vaccination.

-Persistence of anti-

The immunogenicity of the HPV vaccines was measured using three methods:  
• 
• 
• 
A competitive radio-immunoassay (cRIA) 
A competitive Luminex-based immunoassay (cLIA) and  
A xenograft based HPV 11 neutralization (NT) assay.  
During the development programme, the early cRIA assay was transitioned to cLIA assay, which was 
subsequently  used  during  the  phase  III  trials.  The  immune  response  to  each  vaccine  HPV  type  was 
measured separately. 
Primary study population was the per-protocol immunogenicity (PPI) population defined as: 
• 
Subjects who were seronegative and PCR negative to the relevant HPV type(s) at Day 1, 
remained HPV PCR negative through 1 month post dose 3 (month 7), received all 3 
vaccinations within pre-specified time intervals, and no deviation from the study protocol. 
The following immunogenicity objectives were focused on: 
• 
To evaluate vaccine-induced serum anti-HPV responses during the vaccination regimen, 4 
weeks following the completion of a the 3-dose regimen as well as persistence of antibody 
response for up to 3.5 years  
To define impact of base-line covariates (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity) and deviations from 
vaccination regimen at 4 weeks post-dose 3

• 
To bridge the efficacy data obtained in female subjects aged 16 to 26 years of age at enrolment 
to subjects 10 to 15 years of age at enrolment by demonstrating that the post dose 3 anti-HPV 
responses in the younger age group are non-inferior to those observed in the older group  
For HPV 11 to demonstrate that immune responses are virus neutralizing 
To establish that vaccine-induced responses are comparable or superior to immune responses to 
natural infection 
To establish that the HPV vaccine can generate memory responses in subjects seropositive for 
one or more HPV types at baseline 
To investigate potential immune correlates of vaccine efficacy 
The phase III trials also compared immune responses between treatment groups to address 
questions of concomitant administration of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (P011), consistency 
of manufacturing process (P015) and evaluation of partial-dose formulations (P016) 
Primary immunological endpoints were: 
• 
Geometric mean titres (GMTs) of anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18, 4 
weeks after the third dose (Month 7)  
Proportion of subjects who seroconverted to each of the four antigens 4 weeks after the third 
dose.   
• 
Since the minimum anti-HPV levels associated with protection from acquisition of HPV is not known, 
the cut-off value of validated assays was used as a surrogate for seropositive level. The cLIA cutoffs 
for  seropositivity  were  as  follows:  >20  mMU/ml  for  HPV  6  and  16,  >16  mMU/ml  for  HPV  11 and 
>24 mMU/ml for HPV 18.  
• 
Monovalent HPV vaccines (n=3,160 subjects)  
Initial phase I/IIa studies evaluated the immunogenicity of monovalent vaccine precursors in 3,160 16- 
to  26-year-old  female  subjects  (1,842  vaccine/1,318  placebo).  All  studies  were  randomised,  double 
blind  and  placebo-controlled  and  all  vaccine  candidates  were  given  in  a  3-dose  schedule  (0,  2,  6 
months). Monovalent HPV 11 LI VPL vaccine was evaluated in one study (P001).   
The HPV 11 L1 VLP vaccine was chosen as the first vaccine for evaluation in humans, since it was 
possible  to  use  the  nude  mouse  xenograft  model  for  HPV  11  infection  to  determine  if  the  vaccine 
could 
induce  neutralizing  antibodies.  A  correlation  was  demonstrated  between  functional 
(neutralizing) antibodies and cRIA/cLIA antibodies. The vaccine proved immunogenic with 90-100% 
of  subjects  reaching  the  pre-specified  cRIA  level  of  >200  mMU/ml  4  weeks  postdose  3.  Anti-HPV 
levels were shown to decline after Month 7, but were still detectable at Month 36 at levels above those 
induced by natural infection. A fourth dose at Month 12 was shown to induce higher anti-HPV levels 
than postdose 3, but the differences dissipated after one year and therefore it was decided to use the 3-
dose regimen in subsequent trials. Anti-HPV levels in cervicovaginal mucosa was measured in lavage, 
but proved difficult to standardise due to intrinsic problems encountered in accurate sampling of the 
mucosal surface. Therefore, it was determined not to include this assay in subsequent studies. 
The other phase I/IIa studies (P002, P004 and P006) confirmed the immunogenicity results obtained in 
P001.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  pre-specified  cRIA  cut-off  levels  varied  by  study.  The  kinetics  of 
vaccine-induced anti-HPV responses were evaluated, demonstrating a priming effect of 2 doses with 
peak titres achieved at Month 7, after which titres declined rapidly by around 1 log to reach a plateau 
at Month 24, which remained stable to Month 36. Based on dose-ranging data from P002 and P004, 
the 40mcg-dose for the HPV 16 vaccine was selected for the first efficacy trial (P005).  
Mode of action 
A substudy in an early monovalent HPV 11 L1 VLP vaccine clinical trial was conducted to measure 
HPV  11  L1-VLP  vaccine  priming  of  humoral  and  cellular  immune  responses  in  seronegative,  HPV 
DNA-negative, college-age women. The results of this study were consistent with those observed in 
the non-human primate study; Th1 or Th2 cytokines (IFN-γ or IL-5) were detected in response to HPV 
11 L1 VLP in vitro re-stimulation for all vaccine recipients and none of the placebo recipients tested.  
The  predominant  T-cell  population  with  detectable  IFN-γ  and  IL-5  production  was  the  T-cell 
subpopulation depleted of CD8+ T-cells. The overall HPV-specific T-cell activity was observed as a 
discrete proliferative response consistent with homeostasis in memory T-cell responses. In addition the

immunoglobulin isotype and subclass profiles elicited by vaccination demonstrated the generation of 
both Th1 and Th2 responses (IgG1 and IgG2). 
In a separate sub study several cohorts, including a cohort of 10- to 15-year-old virgin females who 
participated  in  one  of  the  quadrivalent  HPV  vaccine  trials  were  evaluated  for  Th1  T-cell  immunity. 
The results demonstrated no response prior to vaccination, however post-vaccination strong HPV 16 
L1 peptide-specific T-cell responses were observed in all subjects. Vaccination of young females with 
the  quadrivalent  HPV  L1  VLP  vaccine  resulted  in  induction  of  a  strong  L1  peptide-specific  IFNγ-
associated T-cell response and a concomitant B-cell response producing L1 VLP-specific antibodies.

Study 012 
This substudy to study P013, aimed at bridging anti-HPV 16 responses between the monovalent HPV 
16  vaccine  used  in  the  first  efficacy  trial  005  (Pilot  Manufacturing  Material,  PMM)  and  the 
quadrivalent  HPV  vaccine  (Final  Manufacturing  Process,  FMP)  used  in  the  pivotal  efficacy  trials. 
Non-inferiority  of  the  anti-HPV  16  GMTs  and  seroconversion  responses  at  Month  7  in  the  FMP 
quadrivalent  HPV  vaccine  group  relative  to  the  PMM  HPV  16  vaccine  was  demonstrated.  This 
allowed including the P005 trial in the pooling of efficacy data from all efficacy trials. 
Study 015V1 
Study  P015V1,  a  substudy  to  study  015,  was  a  lot  consistency  study.  The  primary  objective  was  to 
demonstrate that 3 separate lots of the quadrivalent vaccine induced similar GMTs to HPV types 6, 11, 
16 and 18 at Week 4 postdose 3. Based on the non-inferiority criteria defined, consistency of the anti-
HPV responses in the 3 vaccine lot groups was demonstrated.  
Study 016 
This  study  consisted  of  two  immunogenicity  studies,  the  adolescent  substudy  and  the  end-expiry 
substudy that partly used the same study participants.  
The adolescent study 016V1 was designed to bridge the efficacy findings in the older age groups to 
virginal  aged  15  years  and  younger  by  demonstrating  that  10-  to  15-year-old  subjects  had  immune 
responses to a 3-dose regimen that were non-inferior to those observed in the 16- to 23-year olds. In 
the  absence  of  an  immune  correlate  of  efficacy,  immune  responses  in  the  demographic  groups  were 
compared using GMTs and the proportion of subjects who were naïve to HPV vaccine types and who 
became seropositive to the relevant HPV types at Month 7.

For each of the 4 HPV types the vaccine induced numerically higher GMTs 4 weeks postdose 2 and 3 
in adolescents than in adult females. Postdose 2 anti-HPV 6/11/16/18 levels among adolescents were 
comparable  to  those  observed  postdose  3  among  16-  to  23-old  females.  Numerically  higher  GMTs 
were  also  observed  in  the  male  adolescent  group  compared  with  the  female  adolescent  group 
consistently across the HPV vaccine types. The results of the statistical analyses demonstrated that the 
quadrivalent HPV vaccine induced non-inferior immune responses in the 10- to 15-year-old females 
and 10- to 15-year-old males compared with 16- to 23-year-old females. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  end-expiry  study  016V2  was  to  identify  the  minimum  partial-dose 
formulation of quadrivalent HPV vaccine among the 20, 40, 60% partial-dose formulations, given in a 
3-dose  regimen,  that  induced  immune  responses  non-inferior  to  administration  of  100%  full-dose 
formulation.  The  key  assumption  in  this  study  was  that  testing  partial  doses  of  the  vaccine  could 
approximate the impact of manufacturing process loss in addition to vaccine potency loss over time on 
the immunogenicity of the vaccine. The primary immunogenicity hypothesis compared GMTs within 
3  pairs  of  vaccination  groups  20%  formulation  vs.  100%  formulation,  40%  vs.  100%  and  60%  vs. 
100%. The criteria for declaring success required success on at least 1 of the 3 comparisons. A nested 
testing procedure was performed in 3 stages using an alpha level of 0.025 (1-sided) at each stage. In 
the first stage the 20% partial-dose formulation of the HPV vaccine was compared with the full-dose 
formulation. Since this comparison fulfilled the criteria for non-inferiority, testing stopped at this stage 
and  all  partial-dose  formulations  were  declared  non-inferior  to  the  100%  formulation.  All  lower 
confidence bounds exceeded 0.5 and correspondingly, all p-values were <0.025.  
Study 018 
This  study  was  conducted  to  further  define  the  safety and immunogenicity of the quadrivalent HPV 
vaccine  in  9-  to  15-year-old  subjects.  Study  P018  also  provided  a  comparison  to  non-aluminium-
containing  placebo.  Enrolment  was  stratified  by  gender  and  age  (1:1  male/female;  2:1  9-12  year-
old/13-15 year-old). The study population contained almost 700 subjects aged 9 to 12 years.  
Primary  objective  was  to  assess  safety,  but  the  study  also  included  secondary  immunogenicity 
objectives to demonstrate that the 4-week postdose 3 anti-HPV 6/11/16/18 immune responses (GMTs 
and  percentage  of  subjects  who  seroconvert)  in  pre-/adolescent  boys  were  non-inferior  to  the 
responses  observed  in  pre-/adolescent  girls  All  subjects  demonstrated  a  strong  antibody  response  to 
the HPV vaccine. GMTs at Month 7 were higher among boys than girls. The Month 7 GMTs for all 
vaccine types were higher among 9- to 12-year-old subjects than among 13- to 15-year-old subjects. 
The  statistical  criteria  for  non-inferiority  with  respect  to  both  GMTs  and  seroconversion  rates  were 
met.

Dose response study 
Study 007  
Study  007  was  designed  as  a  dose-ranging  study  evaluating  immunogenicity  (cRIA)  of  3  vaccine 
formulations. The dose ranging concerned HPV 6 and HPV 18, whereas HPV 11 was tested only at a 
higher  dose  (80mcg)  in  one  formulation.  The  dose  of  HPV  16  (40mcg)  was  fixed,  based  on  results 
from previous phase I/II trials. The primary objective of P007 was to select a dose for the phase III 
trials, which was performed in a pre-planned interim analysis after 50% of the subjects had received 
Dose 3. Antibody kinetics was also evaluated and demonstrated a priming effect of the first 2 doses. 
All  3  doses  were  demonstrated  to  induce  high  anti-HPV  levels  without  any  clear  dose  response 
pattern,  which  favoured  the  lowest  dose  20/40/40/20mcg.  Moreover,  a  modest  increase  in  injection-
adverse events was observed with the higher dose formulations. 
Preliminary  data  on  an  extension  of  study  P007  up  to  5  years  were  provided.  Subjects  in  the 
quadrivalent  HPV  vaccine  20/40/40/20-mcg  dose  formulation  group  and  placebo  subjects  who  were 
enrolled  in  Europe  and  Brazil  (n=241)  were  followed  through  Month  60.  The  plateau  of  anti-HPV 
GMTs reached at Month 24 was shown to remain stable through the follow-up period up to Month 60. 
Administration  of  a  pre-planned  fourth  dose  (booster  dose)  at  Month  60  was  evaluated  in  78-87 
subjects.  A  strong  anamnestic  response  was  observed  for  all  4  HPV  types  included  in  the  vaccine, 
suggesting that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine induces an immune memory. The booster dose appeared 
well tolerated.  
Co-administration 
Study 011 
This  substudy  of  study  013  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  the  HPV 
vaccine  when  administered  alone  or  concomitantly  with  the  recombinant  hepatitis  B  vaccine.  The 
primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  that  concomitant  administration  of  the  two  vaccines  did  not 
interfere  with  the  immune  response  to  either  vaccine.  Non-inferiority  of  the  anti-HPV  responses 
(GMTs  and  seroconversion  rates)  after  the  third  dose  in  the  concomitant  group  relative  to  the  HPV 
vaccine  only  group  was  demonstrated.  Also  with  regard  to  the  anti-HBV  seroprotection  rates  in  the 
concomitant  group  relative  to  hepatitis  B  vaccine  alone,  non-inferiority  criteria  were  met.  However, 
with respect to the anti-HBs GMTs, lower titres were observed in the concomitant group (535 vs 792 
mIU/ml). Thus, the HPV vaccine appears to have a negative impact on the hepatitis B GMTs, although 
the  clinical  significance  of  these  lower  titres  is  not  known.  Overall,  the  anti-HBs  responses  seemed 
lower than would be expected in this group of young healthy females, which might be associated with 
the low immunogenicity of the hepatitis B component. Additional analyses of the data were provided, 
which did not add further concern.  
A  statement,  regarding  the  reduced  anti-HBs  titres  following  the  concomitant  vaccination  with 
Gardasil  is  included  in  the  SPC  section  4.5.  The  applicant  was  strongly  recommended  to  perform  a 
non-inferiority  study  with  the  new  upgraded  hepatitis  B  vaccine  and  also  include  an  additional  arm 
with the other recombinant hepatitis B vaccine available on the EU market.

A total of 20,887 subjects were enrolled in studies 005, 007, 013, and 015. This includes 304 subjects 
who  received  monovalent  HPV  16  L1  VLP  vaccine  in  study  012,  a  sub-study  of  study  013.  The 
subjects were enrolled from 5 continents and 22 countries, with Europe well represented. 
Study 005 was the proof-of-concept study, evaluating efficacy of a monovalent HPV 16 L1 VLP 40 
mcg vaccine in preventing persistent HPV 16 infection.  
Study 007 was the dose-ranging study of the quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine, 
and  involved  551  female  subjects  evaluated  for  efficacy  of  the  phase  III  formulation  (20/40/40/20 
mcg) in preventing persistent HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection or disease.  
Studies 013 and 015 are the pivotal studies of the efficacy of the quadrivalent vaccine against vaccine 
HPV-related  EGL  and  CIN and enrolled 5,746 and 12,157 female subjects, respectively. All studies 
were  double-blind,  randomised  and  placebo-controlled.  The  study  subjects  were  healthy  16-  to  23 
(26)-year-old women.  
METHODS 
Study Participants  
The  study  subjects  were  healthy  16-  to  23  (26)-year-old  women.  The  studies  did  not  include  a 
screening phase. Thus, both naïve individuals and individuals who had been exposed to HPV prior to 
enrolment were included. All subjects had at inclusion: 
(cid:153) Serum anti-HPV testing 
(cid:153) Pap test 
(cid:153) Cervicovaginal sampling for HPV typing  
(cid:153) Colposcopy if Pap test showed some abnormalities 
Irrespectively  of  results  of  these  examinations,  subjects  were  randomised  to  either  HPV  vaccine  or 
placebo. Five populations were considered for HPV-specific efficacy analysis:  
17/40 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Per-protocol efficacy (all studies):  
(cid:153) Received all 3 doses of study vaccine  
(cid:153) Were seronegative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) at Day 1 
(cid:153) Were PCR negative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) Day 1 to Month 7 
(cid:153) Did not have general protocol violations 
(cid:153) Cases counted starting 30 days postdose 3 (Month 7). 
Since  subjects  were  not  pre-screened  for  HPV  and  were  included  regardless  of  HPV  status  and  Pap 
test at baseline, only 64% to 84% (depending on HPV type) of all study subjects were included in the 
primary per-protocol efficacy (PPE) cohort. 
The Per-Protocol Efficacy (PPE) population was used as the primary efficacy population. 
MITT-populations (modified Intend to Treat Populations): 
(cid:153) MITT-1 population included protocol violators, but was otherwise similar to the PPE  
(cid:153) MITT-2 included HPV-vaccine-type naïve subjects who received at least 1 dose  
(cid:153) MITT-4 included HPV-vaccine-type naïve subjects who received at least 2 doses (only P013) 
MITT-3 population (all studies)  
(cid:153) Received at least 1 injection 
(cid:153) Pap test: normal or abnormal at Day 1 
(cid:153) Regardless of HPV serology /PCR status at Day 1 
The MITT-3 population represents the general (female) population in this age group. 
For the analyses that were not HPV-vaccine-type specific (population benefit analyses) the following 
populations were defined: 
Restricted MITT-2 population (P013, P015)  
(cid:153) Received at least 1 injection 
(cid:153) Were seronegative to all 4 vaccine HPV types at Day 1 
(cid:153) Were PCR negative to all 4 vaccine HPV types at Day 1 
(cid:153) Pap test: normal at Day 1 (used as a surrogate for non-vaccine HPV types) 
This population represents virginal HPV-naïve adolescents. 
Restricted MITT-3 population (P013, P015, combined analysis)  
(cid:153) Received at least 1 injection 
(cid:153) Pap test: normal at Day 1 
(cid:153) Regardless of HPV serology/PCR status at Day 1 
For  potential  therapeutic  benefit  of  the  vaccine  (P013,  P015)  the  following  subpopulations  were 
evaluated: 
(cid:153) Subjects who were seronegative and PCR positive at Day 1 to the relevant vaccine HPV type 
(cid:153) Subjects who were seropositive and PCR negative at Day 1 to the relevant vaccine HPV type 
(cid:153) Subjects who were seropositive and PCR positive at Day 1 to the relevant vaccine HPV type 
Treatments 
All subjects received either quadrivalent HPV VLP vaccines (HPV LI VLP vaccine 40 mcg in study 
005) or placebo at day 0, month 2 and month 6. 
All  subjects  underwent  Pap  testing  and  cervicovaginal  sampling  for  HPV  testing  every  6  months 
(studies 005, 007, and 013) or every 12 months (study 015). Referral to colposcopy was based on Pap 
18/40 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
test  diagnosis.  All  colposcopies  were  to  be  performed  at  study  site  by  an  experienced  colposcopist. 
Referral to definitive therapy during the trial (surgical ablation and histological assessment) was based 
on  Pap  test  (repeated  CIN  1,  high-grade  squamous  intraepithelial  lesions  (HSIL))  +/-abnormal 
colposcopy. 
Objectives 
The  study  objectives  of  the  clinical  program  for  the  HPV  vaccine  were  to  demonstrate  that 
administration of the HPV vaccine would reduce the incidence of: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
HPV  16/18-related  high-grade  cervical  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (CIN  2/3)  or  cervical  adeno-
carcinoma in situ (AIS) as surrogate for cervical cancer 
HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN of any grade 
HPV 6/11/16/18-related external genital lesions (EGLs) - condyloma acuminata (genital warts) 
vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) 
HPV 16/18-related VIN 2/3 or VaIN 2/3 as surrogates for vaginal cancer and vulvar cancer  
And that administration of the HPV vaccine will reduce the overall incidence of HPV-related cervical 
and genital disease. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The Applicant defined two types of endpoints: 
Persistent HPV infection: used in study 005 (primary endpoint) and study 007, defined as: 
• 
• 
• 
Persistent vaccine-type HPV infections without confirmed CIN: detection of vaccine-type HPV 
DNA by PCR on at least 2 consecutive visits spaced for at least 4 months 
Detection  of  vaccine-type  HPV  DNA  by  PCR  on  the  last  visit  without  confirmation  of 
persistence 
Vaccine-type HPV infection with confirmed CIN: histologically confirmed CIN 1, 2, 3, AIS, or 
cervical carcinoma due to vaccine-type HPV  
Disease endpoints: were included in all efficacy studies 
• 
• 
• 
The incidence of HPV 16-related CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3 or worse (study 005) 
The combined incidence of CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3 or worse and combined incidence of external 
genital lesions related to HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 (study 007) 
The combined incidence of CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3 or worse related to HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 and 
combined  incidence  of  condyloma  acuminata  VIN  1,  VIN  2/3,  VaIN  1,  VaIN  2/3  or  worse 
related to HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 (two co-primary endpoints: external genital lesion endpoint and 
cervical lesion endpoint) (study 013) 
• 
The incidence of AIS, CIN 2/3 or worse related to HPV 16 or HPV 18 (study 015). 
Study 005 used a primary virological endpoint, whereas histological endpoints were used in study 007 
and the two phase III trials (P013 and P015).  
Disease endpoint definitions differed among the studies due to differences in the vaccines tested, i.e. 
005  evaluating  the  HPV  16  vaccine,  007  evaluating  different  quadrivalent  HPV  vaccine  doses  and 
013/015  evaluating  the  quadrivalent  HPV  vaccine.  Endpoint  definitions  also  differed  among  studies 
005, 007, 013, and 015 due to the evolution of the method used to assess the causal HPV type within a 
lesion.  
All HPV endpoints were histologically classified. The primary CIN and EGL endpoints of the studies 
were based on biopsies and required HPV DNA to be detected in the same tissue specimen by thin-
section  PCR.  An  independent  blinded  Pathology  Panel  was  used  for  adjudication  of  all  study 
endpoints.  A  comprehensive  testing  program  was  used  for  HPV-related  disease.  The  results  of  the 
ThinPrep  Pap  test  were  used  to  identify  subjects  with  cervical  HPV  disease  and  thorough  genital

inspection to identify subjects with EGLs. The protocol-specified genital examinations and mandatory 
guidelines  for  triage  of  abnormal  Pap  test  to  colposcopy  ensured  consistency  and  standardised 
ascertainment of HPV-related lesions among study sites.  
Sample size / Statistical methods 
Neither  study  013  nor  study  015  was  individually  powered  to  provide  substantial  evidence  to 
demonstrate  that  the  HPV  vaccines  reduce  the  incidence  of  HPV  16/18-related  CIN  2/3  or  AIS, 
efficacy data were to be combined from all 4 studies in a pre-specified analysis. 
Studies 013 and 015 were designed as fixed-case studies. The vaccine efficacy (VE) evaluations were 
to  be  performed  when  a  pre-specified  number  of  endpoint  cases  had  been  observed.  Final  efficacy 
analyses were to be performed at the end of studies. The requisite numbers of endpoint cases for both 
studies were obtained in August 2005, when the majority of subjects had been followed for at total of 
2  years  (1.5  years  after  completion  of  the  3-dose  regimen).  Data  available  at  this  time  point  were 
unblinded and analysed and form the basis of this application. Study 013 and study 015 are currently 
ongoing and vaccine efficacy is to be re-estimated at the end of the 4-year follow-up.  
RESULTS 
Overall 19,321 subjects (93% of subjects who received at least 1 one vaccine dose) continued in the 
study  from  the  time  of  enrolment  through  the  date  at  which  the  database  was  closed  (Aug  2005). 
Except for the study 005, where 84.6% of patients received the 3 injections (in the vaccine group), in 
other studies 93 to 98% of patients received 3 injections.  
There  were  regional  differences  between  studies.  Study  005  was  recruiting  subjects  only  in  the  US; 
study 013 had the largest recruitment in Latin America (41%) and study 015 in Europe (65%).  
Overall  13%  of  the  combined  population  had  a  test  compatible  with  CIN  at  Day  1  and  27%  of  the 
combined population was either seropositive or PCR positive to a vaccine HPV type at baseline.  
The median durations of follow-up were 4.0, 3.0, 2.0 and 2.0 years for P005, P007, P013 and P015, 
respectively. 
Baseline data 
The  demographic  characteristics  were  generally  comparable  between  vaccine  and  placebo  groups 
regarding  the  age,  race,  geographic  region,  smoking  status,  alcohol  consumption,  and  history  of 
sexually transmitted diseases at enrolment.  
Sexual  demographics  differed  by  geographic region. Age at sexual debut occurred at a mean age of 
16.7 years. Hormonal contraception was the most common form of contraception (59%) and highest in 
Europe (68%). 
The  demographic  profile  of  subjects  in  the  PPE  population  was  general  comparable  to  the  overall 
population.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy results of individual studies 
Study 005: The primary efficacy endpoint of study 005 was the incidence of new persistent HPV 16 
infection. Two efficacy analyses were performed, a fixed-case analysis and a final analysis at the end 
of  the  4-year  study  follow-up.  In  the  first  analysis  in  the  PPE  population,  all  41  cases  of  persistent 
HPV 16 infection were in the placebo group. At end-of-study, 7 cases in the vaccine group had HPV 
16 detected at the last study visit (without confirmed persistence). There were no cases of HPV-related 
CIN in the vaccine group in the fixed-case or end-of-study analyses versus 9 and 24, respectively in 
the placebo group. The MITT-2 results supported those of the PPE analyses.

In  the  MITT-3  population,  at  the  end  of  study,  there  was  a  significant  reduction  of  HPV  16-related 
persistent infection and CIN in the vaccine group as compared to placebo; out of 67 cases of persistent 
HPV infection in the vaccine group, 9 patients had HPV 16-related CIN. In the placebo group, out of 
217 cases of persistent HPV infection, 44 patients had HPV 16-related CIN. There was a significant 
reduction  of  HPV  16-related  CIN  2/3  or  worse  in  the  vaccine  group  as  compared  to  placebo  (VE: 
77.9% (95% CI: 40.6; 93.4)). 
A re-analyses using the appropriate WHO  definition of persistent infection (>6-12 and >12 months) 
were provided for study 005. It was demonstrated that one-third to one-fourth of the observed HPV 
infections  were  of  shorter  duration  than  6  months.  Including  only  cases  >6  months  in  the  MITT-2 
analysis reduced the estimates of efficacy, but vaccine efficacy still remained high (5 vaccine vs. 88 
placebo cases). For the >12 month definition there were 3 vs. 43 placebo cases (VE: 93.3% (95%CI: 
79.1, 100).  
Study  007:  In  the  dose-ranging  study  007,  the  20/40/40/20mcg  dose  was  selected  for  the  phase  III 
studies and only this dose was formally evaluated for vaccine efficacy. The primary endpoint was the 
incidence of new HPV6/11/16/18-related persistent infection, CIN and/or EGL. The efficacy estimate 
at the end of study (2.5 years follow-up) was 89.5% in the PPE population.

Of  the  4  endpoint  cases  in  the  vaccine  group  there  were  3  infections  without  confirmed  persistence 
and 1 case of confirmed persistent HPV 18 infection. There were no cases of CIN or external genital 
disease  in  the  vaccine  group  versus  5  cases  in  the  placebo  group.  In  the  two  higher  vaccine  groups 
(40/40/40/40 mcg, 80/80/40/80 mcg), the incidence rates of persistent HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 infection 
or related disease were comparable to those observed with the final formulation. Only results for PPE 
population  were  provided  for  the  higher  dose  groups.  There  were  7  cases  of  persistent  infection  (2 
confirmed) and 3 cases (1 confirmed) in the higher dose groups, of which two were HPV 18-related 
and one was HPV 16-related. 
In  the  MITT-3  population  there  were  23  patients  with  persistent  infection  in  the  vaccine  group,  of 
whom 3 had HPV-related CIN (two were HPV 16-related CIN 3, one was HPV 18-related CIN 1). In 
the  placebo  group,  there  were  61  patients  with  persistent  HPV  infection,  of  whom  4  had  external 
genital  lesions  (three  were  condyloma  (one  HPV  6-related,  one  HPV  6/16-related,  one  HPV  11-
related),  and  one  was  a  VIN  2/3  (HVP  16-related))  and  12  had  HPV-related  CIN  (one  was  HPV  6-
related CIN 3, one was HPV 18-related CIN 2, two were HPV 16-related CIN 1, three were HPV 16-

related CIN 2, three were HPV 16-related CIN 3, one was HPV 18-related CIN 1, one was HPV 18-
related CIN 2). 
Preliminary efficacy data through a study 007 extension up to 5 years were provided. After the end of 
study  007  (Month  36),  subjects  were  re-evaluated  at  Month  54  and  60.  Results  at  Month  60  are 
presented in the table below and suggest persistence of efficacy. Sensitivity analyses were performed 
to assess impact of the gap of 18 months (between month 36 and 54) during which no scheduled visits 
occurred. A supplementary analysis was also performed restricted to the subjects that participated in 
the 5-year extension (n=204).

A re-analyses using the appropriate WHO  definition of persistent infection (>6-12 and >12 months) 
were  provided  for.  It  was  demonstrated  that  one-third  to  one-fourth  of  the  observed  HPV  infections 
were  of  shorter  duration  than  6  months.  Including  only  cases  >6  months  in  the  MITT-2  analysis 
reduced  the  estimates  of  efficacy,  but  vaccine  efficacy  still  remained  high  (1  vs.  23).  For  the  >12 
month definition there were 0 vs.11 cases (VE: 100% (95%CI: 43.3, 100). However, vaccine efficacy 
was only established for persistent HPV 16 infection, whereas for persistent HPV 18 infection there 
were  too  few  cases  to  obtain  significant  results.  Since  according  to  the  WHO  expert  statement 
(Vaccine 23, (2004) 569-578) this virological endpoint is not considered as a valid primary efficacy 
endpoint for HPV vaccines, the claim for persistent infection in the indication cannot be accepted. 
Study 013 (Future I): Study 013 covered the entire spectrum of clinical genital disease and had 2 co-
primary  efficacy  endpoints,  one  EGL  endpoint  (incidence  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  genital  warts, 
VIN,  VaIN,  vulvar  or  vaginal  cancer),  and  one  cervical  endpoint  (incidence  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-
related CIN (1,2,3), AIS or cervical cancer). Only the results of the fixed case analysis were provided 
in this application.  At this time point, the majority of patients have completed 2 years of follow-up. 
The results of the primary efficacy analysis in the PPE population are shown below.

Primary efficacy was also analysed by HPV type and CIN lesion and demonstrated that most endpoint 
cases  were  HPV  16-related  (~59%).  Approximately  half  of  subjects  with  a  CIN  lesion  had  a 
pathological diagnosis of CIN 2 or worse. Vaccine efficacy (VE) against CIN 3/AIS was 100% with 
the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  of  55%.  No  cases  of  invasive  cervical  cancer  were  detected  among 
subjects in any population. In the MITT-2 population, VE was 96.5% with 2 cases of CIN detected in 
the vaccine group versus 57 in the placebo group.

The cumulative incidence of HPV vaccine type-related CIN was 4.3% in the placebo and 2.5% in the 
vaccine group. The vaccine reduced the risk of diagnosis with HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN from 1 in 
23 to 1 in 40 over the 2-year mean duration of follow-up.  
Efficacy against external genital lesions 
In the primary analysis of the PPE population, all cases of EGL and of VIN/VaIN 2/3 occurred in the 
placebo  group  (see  below).  In  the  MITT-2  population  VE  against  HPV6/11/16/18-related  EGL  was 
94.9% (95% CI: 84.4, 99.0).

In  the  MITT-3  population,  further  EGL  cases  were  observed,  but  vaccine  efficacy  (VE)  against  the 
combined  incidence  was  still  significant  (68%,  lower  bound  of  95%  CI  >20%).  VE  was  non-
significant  against  VIN/VaIN  2/3  (lower  bound  of  95%  CI  <0%).  Cumulative  incidence  of  HPV 
6/11/16/18-related  EGL  was  3%  in  the  placebo  group  and  1%  in  the  vaccine  group.  Vaccination 
reduced the risk of EGL diagnosis from 1 in 33 to 1 in 103 over the 2 years of follow-up.

The efficacy in the MITT-2 population (VE: 97%) was supportive of the PPE results. The additional 
13 placebo cases and one vaccine case (HPV 16) observed in the MITT-2 were subjects who became 
infected with vaccine HPV types during the vaccination period prior to Month 7.  
The  magnitude  of  efficacy  was  substantially  lower  in  the  MITT-3  population,  but  still  significant 
against  CIN  2  (VE:  51%)  and  CIN  3/AIS  (VE:  44%).  Compared  with  MITT-2,  there  were  141 
additional cases (66 vaccine, 75 placebo). The great majority of these cases occurred among subjects 
who were HPV 16 and 18 PCR positive and/or seropositive at baseline. Over a 2-year follow-up the 
cumulative incidence of HPV16/18-related CIN 2/3 in the placebo and vaccine group were 1.9% and 
1.1%, respectively with a total of 1 in 54 subjects and 1 in 89 subjects, respectively, developing such a 
lesion.

In the secondary efficacy analysis the vaccine was demonstrated to reduce the incidence of EGLs in all 
populations studied with VE of 99% (95% CI: 91.8, 100) in the PPE population and 71% (95% CI: 
58.8, 79.9) in the MITT-3 population. With respect to VIN/VaIN 2/3, there were 0 cases in the vaccine 
group versus 6 cases in the placebo group in the PPE population (VE 100% (95% CI: 15.2, 100)) and 
4 versus 18 cases, respectively, in the MITT-3 population (VE 78% (95% CI: 32.2, 94.5)).  
Ancillary analyses 
•  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The data on the separate EGL diseases were given for separate studies only in the PPE population but 
for  the  integrated  efficacy  dataset  (P007,  P013,  and  P015)  in  the  PPE-,  MITT-2  and  MITT-3 
populations. In the PPE combined analyses statistically significant vaccine efficacy was demonstrated 
against both vulvar and vaginal condyloma acuminata, VIN 1, VIN 2/3 and VaIN 1. VE against VaIN 
2/3 was not established due to very few cases. However for single studies only efficacy against genital 
warts (P013, P015) and VIN 1 (P015) was established. The majority of condyloma was HPV 6 and 11-
related and located in the vulva.

Integrated summary of efficacy –HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN and EGL of all grades 
An integrated summary of vaccine efficacy with respect to CIN and EGL outcomes in studies 007, 013 
and study 015 was pre-planned. Data from study 005 contributed only with respect to HPV 16-related 
CIN.  A  total  of  20,887  women  were  included  in  this  analysis.  The  summary  report  focused  on  the 
incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN and EGL of all grades. 
The  integrated  data  from  all  efficacy  studies,  with  regard  to  CIN  endpoints,  demonstrated  that  the 
vaccine in the PPE population: 
• 
• 
• 
Reduced the incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN/AIS (4 vs. 83 placebo cases; VE: 95.2% 
(95% CI: 87.2, 98.7)  
Reduced the incidence of CIN 1 caused by vaccine HPV types (4 vs. 58 placebo cases; VE: 93.1 
% (95% CI: 81.4, 98.2))  
Prevented the development of International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 
Stage  0  (non-invasive)  cervical  cancer  (CIN  3/AIS)  caused  by  vaccine  HPV  types  (0  vs.  26 
placebo cases; VE: 100% (95% CI: 84.8, 100))  
The  vaccine  efficacy  against  CIN  endpoints  in  the  MITT-3  population  was  46.4%  (95%  CI:  35.2, 
55.7) (170 vs. 317 placebo cases), 54.4% (95% CI: 41.8, 64.5) (97 vs. 213 placebo cases) and 33.1% 
(95% CI: 11.1, 49.8) (84 vs. 126 placebo cases), respectively.  
The vaccine efficacy appeared comparable with respect to each HPV type included in the vaccine.

The  integrated  data  from  all  efficacy  studies  in  the  PPE  population  with  regard  to  EGL  endpoints 
provided evidence that prophylactic administration of the HPV vaccine:  
• 
• 
Reduced  the  incidence  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  EGLs  (1  vs.  113  placebo  cases;  VE  99.1% 
(95% CI: 95.0, 100)) and most importantly  
Prevented  the  development  of  VIN  2/3  or  VaIN  2/3  caused  by  vaccine  HPV  types  (0  vs.13 
placebo cases; VE: 100% (95% CI: 67.2, 100)).  
The vaccine efficacy against EGL endpoints in the MITT-3 population was 70.4% (95% CI: 61, 77.7) 
(68 vs. 229 placebo cases) and 73.3% (95% CI: 40.3, 89.4) (8 vs. 30 placebo cases), respectively.  
The  majority  of  the  VIN/VaIN  2/3  were  caused  by  HPV  16/18  (PPE:  10  of  13  and  MITT-3:  all  8 
vaccine and 26 of 30 placebo). 
Genital  warts  predominated  among  EGLs.  The  vaccine  was  efficacious  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-
related genital warts (+ VIN/VaIN 1) (VE 99% (95% CI: 94.4, 100), and those caused by HPV 16/18 
(VE 100% (95% CI: 83.4, 100) in the PPE population. In the MITT- 3 population VE was 70.1% and 
69.1%, respectively.  
The vaccine efficacy appeared comparable with respect to each type included in the vaccine, although 
there were few HPV 18-related EGLs (95% CI lower bound at 50%). 
• 
Combined interim efficacy analysis - HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3  
The composite endpoint of HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 and AIS was chosen as the primary surrogate 
clinical outcome against which the efficacy of Gardasil in preventing cervical cancer was evaluated. 
To increase the precision of vaccine efficacy estimate, a combined analysis of data from all 4 efficacy 
trials was pre-planned. This study population included in this analysis was 20,541 subjects. Data from 
study 005 contributed only to the analysis of HPV 16-related CIN. The primary efficacy analysis was 
based on 53 CIN 2/3 cases and all occurred in the placebo group; vaccine efficacy was 100% in the 
PPE population.

demonstrated for HPV 18. The results in relevant MITT-1 and MITT-2 populations were supportive of 
the primary PPE conclusion. Various sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of data.  
•  Therapeutic efficacy  
There was no evidence that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine has early therapeutic efficacy against CIN 
and EGL vaccine HPV-type endpoints in subjects who were baseline seronegative/PCR positive or 
serpositive/PCR positive.   
•  Population benefit integrated summary of efficacy 
The  population  benefit  of  the  HPV  vaccine  was  measured  in  terms  of  the  vaccine’s  impact  on  the 
overall rates of CIN and EGL disease due to any HPV type, incidence of Pap test abnormalities, and 
cervical  procedures.  Three  MITT  populations  were  defined  to  evaluate  these  parameters:  RMITT-2 
(HPV  naïve  and  negative  Pap  test  at  Day  1  that  received  at  least  1  vaccine  dose),  RMITT-3  (all 
subjects  regardless  of  baseline  HPV  status  with  negative  Pap  test  at  Day  1  that  received  at  least  1 
vaccine dose) and MITT-3 (all subjects regardless of HPV status that received at least 1 vaccine dose).  
Among the RMITT-2 population a significant reduction in the risk of CIN 2 and worse (37.9%) and 
CIN 3 or worse (45.5%) and EGL (66%) due to any type was demonstrated.  
In  the  RMITT-2  population  there  was  a  reduction  in  patients  vaccinated  with  Gardasil  compared  to 
placebo  with  respect  to  number  of  colposcopies  (15%),  cervical  biopsies  (17.2%)  and  cervical 
definitive  therapies  (28.1%).  Results  observed  in  the  MITT-3  population  were  consistent,  but  the 
impact of the vaccine was lower. 
In  the  RMITT-3  and  MITT-3  population  no  vaccine  efficacy  against  CIN  2  and  worse  could  be 
established.  Regarding  Pap  test  abnormalities  a  modest  reduction  in  the  overall  incidence  was 
observed in the vaccine group compared to placebo.  
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Clinical data demonstrate the prophylactic efficacy of Gardasil in 16- to 23-year old female subjects in 
preventing  the  incidence  of  HPV16/18-related  CIN  2/3  or  AIS,  as  surrogate  markers  for  cervical 
cancer  and  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  external  genital  warts.  Based  on  the  similarities  between  the 
efficacy  studies  with  regard  to  design,  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  and  detection  system  for  HPV-
related CIN, the combined efficacy analysis is acceptable. 
The efficacy results were consistent among studies and showed that the vaccine was highly efficacious 
against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  and  EGLs  in  the  PPE  population.  Consistent  results  were 
obtained  in  three  MITT  populations.  However,  in  the  MITT-3  population  that  included  subjects 
already infected at baseline, vaccine efficacy was much lower. Robustness of data was confirmed in 
various sensitivity analyses. Individual endpoints were also evaluated in all studies, such as efficacy 
by HPV type and by lesion type, which is commented on further below. Data on the MITT-2 and -4 
populations indicated that the vaccine was efficacious already after 2 doses. However, only 0.3% of 
study  subjects  received  less  than  3  doses  (n=39  vaccinees)  and  therefore  no  meaningful  efficacy 
analyses after 2 vaccine doses could be made. 
Immunogenicity was evaluated in pre-/adolescent females. It was shown that the anti-HPV responses 
increased as the age at which vaccination was initiated decreased. For each 4 HPV types, the vaccine 
induced numerically higher GMTs 4 weeks postdose 2 and 3 in 9- to 15-year-old females than in 16- 
to  26-year  old  females.  Immunogenicity  was  related  to  age  and  Month  7  anti-HPV  levels  were 
significantly  higher  in  younger  individuals  below  12  years  of  age  than  in those above that age. The 
results of the statistical analyses demonstrated that the vaccine induced non-inferior immune responses 
as measured by GMTs and seroconversion rates in the adolescent cohort compared with young adult 
women.  Since  efficacy  of  the  HPV  vaccine  cannot  be  evaluated  in  virginal  subjects,  these  data  are 
considered acceptable to allow the bridging of efficacy data from the young adult women to the pre-
/adolescent  girls.  However,  the  durability  of  response  in  this  target  group  as  well  as  long-term 
persistence of efficacy and immunogenicity requires close monitoring for 10 to 15 years. This will be 
critical  for  the  decision  of  the  optimal  age  to  vaccinate  sexually  naïve  subjects.  Long-term 
immunogenicity  will  be  monitored  in  the  target  adolescent  population  during  the  post-authorisation

period. The applicant also outlines a structured booster program. These issues are addressed in the risk 
management plan.  
The maximum health benefits of the HPV vaccine would be obtained if both genders are vaccinated to 
break the cycle of transmission of HPV infection and induce herd immunity. The immunogenicity of 
Gardasil was assessed in male pre-/adolescents 9 to 15 years of age. Anti-HPV responses at Month 7 
among  9-  to  15-year-old  boys  were  non-inferior  to  anti-HPV  responses  in  16- to 26-year-old young 
women for whom efficacy was established in the phase III studies.  
Males were not included in the initial efficacy studies. An ongoing clinical study in 16- to 26-year-old 
male subjects is evaluating the impact of Gardasil on the incidence of persistent infection as well as 
precancerous penile and anal lesions and will be completed in the coming years.   
With regard to the serotype replacement issue, it was shown that the incidence of disease due to non-
vaccine types were 5.5% higher overall in the vaccine group compared to placebo. However time to 
event curves did not reveal any trend of an increasing event rate in the vaccine group compared with 
the placebo group. The issue of type replacement is addressed in the Risk Management Plan. 
Potential therapeutic effects of the vaccine must be re-analysed at the completion of the 4-year follow-
up.  At  this  early  stage  no  beneficial  effect  could  be  seen  in  seronegative/PCR  positive  subjects.  It 
would also be important to evaluate whether the vaccine could be used to boost natural immunity to 
maintain or augment protection. This issue will be further addressed at the time of the final analysis of 
studies 013 and 015. 
Results  of  the  population  benefit  analyses  appear  promising,  but  have  to  be  further  evaluated  on  a 
longer-term basis. The primary analyses of population benefit are planned for later in the course of the 
phase III trials and will give more reliable estimates of the impact of the HPV vaccine on public health 
parameters. The analyses performed illustrated that the burden of HPV disease is substantial in these 
young adult women and that a large amount of disease is caused by non-vaccine HPV types.  
Clinical safety 
•  Patient exposure 
The  safety  of  Gardasil  and  its  monovalent  precursors  was  assessed  in  12  trials.  Of  these,  7  trials 
evaluated  the  quadrivalent  HPV  (types  6,  11,  16,  18)  L1  VLP  vaccine  (P  007,  P011,  P012,  P013, 
P015, P016 and P018). P011 and P012 are substudies of P013.  
The  data  presented  on  the  use  of  HPV  vaccine  comprises  16,014  subjects.  The  overall  exposure 
database  includes:  2146  subjects  receiving  monovalent  HPV  L1  VLP  vaccines;  11,813  subjects 
receiving Gardasil; 1524 subjects receiving quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine 
formulations  containing  VLP  doses  lower  than  those  in  Gardasil  and  552  subjects  receiving 
quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine formulations containing VLP doses higher 
than those in Gardasil. 
•  Adverse events  
Overall more subjects that received Gardasil reported an adverse event, which primarily was due to a 
higher incidence of injection site reactions.

reported  were  generally  similar  between  the  2  vaccination  groups.  Pyrexia,  respiratory  disorders, 
infections  and  infestations  and  nervous  system  disorders  prevailed.  However,  most  of  these  adverse 
events  were  not  serious.  The  proportions  of  subjects  reporting  any  systemic  clinical  adverse 
experience or a vaccine related such event were comparable between the vaccination groups.

A higher number of the subjects in the Gardasil group reported bronchospasm or wheezing. However, 
only one subject in each vaccination group had a study-vaccine related adverse event. The number of 
subjects  who  reported  urticaria  was  higher  in  the  placebo  group.  The  proportions  of  subjects  with 
urticaria that was considered study vaccine related were comparable in both groups.

vaccination  groups  within  the  safety  population.  The  types  of  serious  adverse  experiences  reported 
between  the  vaccination  groups  were  also  comparable.  The  most  common  serious  adverse  events  in 
both  vaccination  groups  were  infections  and  pregnancy.  Overall  6  serious  adverse  experiences  were 
determined to be possibly, probably or definitively related to the study vaccine/placebo.

Eight  subjects  in  the  Safety  Population  group  that  received  Gardasil  (0.07%)  and  6  subjects  in  the 
placebo group (0,06%) died during the course of trials. Three subjects died within 15 days and 11 died 
following  any  vaccination.  None  of  the  deaths  was  considered  to  be  related  to  vaccine/  placebo  or 
procedure.  Five  deaths  were  due  to  trauma,  3  were  due  to  intentional  overdose  (non-study 
medications) or suicide, and 2 were due to pulmonary embolus; most likely related to use of hormonal 
contraceptives.  There  was  1  case  each  of  cancer,  infection,  and  complication  of  Caesarean  section, 
asphyxia and arrhythmia. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Few subjects (0.1% in each vaccination group) discontinued due to an adverse experience.

•  Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy, lactating women, infants to lactating women, adolescent boys and girls 
The numbers of subjects who reported an injection-site adverse event were higher in the groups that 
received  Gardasil  compared  with  the  placebo  groups;  and  the  number  of  subjects  who  reported 
systemic  clinical  adverse  events  were  comparable  between  vaccination  groups.  The  adverse  event 
profiles in 18- to 26-year-old women, 9- to 17-year-old girls and 9- to 15-year-old boys who received 
Gardasil  showed  that  the  proportions  of  subjects  who  experienced  a  serious  adverse  event  or  who 
discontinued  due  to  an  adverse  event  were  comparable  among  the  3  groups.  The  proportions  of 
subjects  who  reported  an  adverse  event  over  all,  an  injection-site  event,  and  a  systemic  event  were 
highest among 18- to 26-year-old women and lowest in 9 to 15 year old boys. Among subjects who 
received Gardasil, the proportions of subjects who reported a fever were comparable. 
Pregnancy 
Although  HPV  is  not  a  teratogenic  and  there  were  no  theoretical  concerns  or  experimental  data  to 
suggest  that  HPV  L1  VLPs  or  aluminium  adjuvant  are  teratogenic,  the  clinical  studies  within  the 
clinical development program prohibited vaccination of pregnant subjects. Thus, there are no studies 
that directly randomized pregnant women to receive Gardasil or placebo. 
In  order  to  evaluate  the  interaction  of  vaccination  and  pregnancy  outcomes,  the  outcomes  of 
pregnancy were summarised according to whether the ECDn (Estimated Day of Conception) occurred 
within  30  days  of  a  study  vaccination  or  whether  it  occurred  beyond  this  time  period.  The 
methodology used to determine the estimated date of conception was based on data described in the 
literature, and ranked source data in order of accuracy in the ability to estimate the gestational age and 
from this the EDCn. 
During the course of immunisation with Gardasil, overall 2,266 women (vaccine: 1,115 vs. placebo: 
1,151) reported at least one pregnancy. Among these pregnancies outcomes were known for 78.1% of 
all  pregnancies.  With  few  exceptions,  the  pregnancies  with  unknown  outcomes  represented  either 
ongoing pregnancies or subjects that discontinued or were lost to follow-up.  
(cid:190) Live born infants   
The proportion of live births that were accompanied by other medical conditions was slightly higher in 
the  group  that  received  Gardasil  than  in  the  placebo  group.  The  most  common  medical  condition 
observed during the neonatal period other than congenital anomaly were prematurity (9 and 8 infants, 
of mothers that received Gardasil and placebo, respectively) neonatal respiratory distress symptom (2 
and 5 infants of mothers who received Gardasil or placebo, respectively), and neonatal jaundice (6 and 
4 infants of mothers who received Gardasil or placebo, respectively). 
(cid:190) Congenital anomalies 
The proportion of live births that resulted in congenital anomalies was slightly higher in the group that 
received Gardasil compared with the placebo group. However, the number of pregnancies that resulted 
in  a  congenital  anomaly  was  small  and  well  within  the  3-4%  incidence  reported  in  studies  of 
pregnancy in large-scale health care systems. If pregnancies resulting in foetal loss due to a congenital 
anomaly  and  pregnancies  with  live  birth  in  which  congenital  anomaly  was  detected  after  the 
immediate neonatal period are included, a total of 13 pregnancies in the group that received Gardasil 
and 12 in the group that received placebo, resulted in a congenital anomaly. 
Further sub-analyses were done to evaluate pregnancies with estimated onset within 30 days or more 
than  30  days  from  administration  of  a  dose  of  Gardasil  or  placebo.  For  pregnancies  with  estimated 
onset within 30 days of vaccination, 5 cases of congenital anomaly were observed in the group that 
received  Gardasil  compared  to  0  cases  of  congenital  anomaly  in  the  group  that  received  placebo. 
Conversely, in pregnancies with onset more than 30 days following vaccination, 8 cases of congenital 
anomaly  were  observed  in  the  group  that  received  Gardasil  compared  with  12  cases  of  congenital 
anomaly in the group that received placebo. No trend of specific effect on any organ system in relation 
to the week of gestational development could be observed. An independent expert in Teratology and 
in  the  impact  of  environmental  pregnancy  outcomes  concluded  that  the  congenital  anomaly  events 
were not associated with exposure to Gardasil or to aluminium-placebo.

Congenital anomalies not detected at birth were also found in 3 infants of mothers given placebo and 
in one infant born to a mother given Gardasil. 
(cid:190) Spontaneous abortion 
Analyses were also performed to evaluate pregnancies with estimated onset within 30 days or beyond 
30 days from administration of Gardasil or placebo. For pregnancies with estimated onset within 30 
days  of  vaccination,  the  proportion  of  pregnancies  that  resulted  in  spontaneous  pregnancy  loss  was 
lower  in  subjects  who  received  Gardasil  (23.1%)  as  compared  to  subjects  who  received  placebo 
(28.3%).  The  opposite  pattern  was  seen  in  pregnancies  with  onset  beyond  30  days  from  any 
vaccination.  The  proportion  of  pregnancies  with  spontaneous  pregnancy  loss  was  higher  in  subjects 
who received Gardasil (34.2%) compared with subjects who received placebo (31.9%).  
(cid:190) Adverse events reported by study subjects during pregnancy 
Overall  40  and  41  subjects  in  the  group  that  received  Gardasil  or  placebo,  respectively  (4.2%  and 
4.3%  of  all  subjects  who  reported  a  pregnancy  in  respective  vaccine  group)  experienced  an  adverse 
event.  The  most  common  events  reported  were  conditions  that  can  result  in  Caesarean  sections, 
premature  onset  of  labour  and  pregnancy  related  medical  problems.  The  proportions  of  pregnant 
subjects who experienced such events were comparable between the vaccination groups. 
(cid:190) Other adverse events in infants of study subjects 
Overall, 9 and 13 infants born to women who received Gardasil or placebo experienced such adverse 
event. None of these, however, had a causal relationship to the vaccine or placebo. 
Administration of Gardasil to lactating women 
Lactating women were also included in the studies. Medical events meeting criteria for serious adverse 
events were collected in both mother and her infant(s) from the time of the possible exposure of the 
infant to the vaccine via breast milk until the child was weaned. 
A total of 995 subjects (500 and 495, who received Gardasil and placebo, respectively) in the safety 
population  group  were  breastfeeding  during  the  vaccination  period.  In  the  subjects  with  serious, 
vaccine  related  clinical  adverse  events,  4  subjects,  2  subjects  and  1  subject  had  at  least  1  serious 
adverse experience that was determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the vaccine, 
respectively. 
(cid:190) Infants to the lactating mothers 
A total of 17 (3.4%) and 9 (1.8%) infants of subjects, respectively, who were breast-feeding during the 
period  when  they  received  vaccine  or  placebo,  experienced  a  serious  adverse  event.  None  of  these 
were judged to be related to the vaccine 
Male Subjects 
All male subjects in the clinical development program for Gardasil were 9 to 15 years of age at study 
enrolment. In boys the proportion of subjects reporting any adverse experience and any injection-site 
adverse  event  were  higher  in  the  group  that  received  Gardasil  compared  with  the  non-aluminium-
containing placebo group.

Serious  adverse  event  and  discontinuations  due  to  an  adverse  event  were  rare,  but  all  these  events 
occurred  in  boys  who  received  Gardasil.  Boys  who  received  Gardasil  reported  somewhat  more 
systemic  clinical  adverse  experiences  compared  with  boys  who  received  non-aluminium-containing 
placebo. The serious adverse event profile was similar to those seen in the other age cohorts and the 
incidence of injection site adverse event and fever predominated in this group. 
More boys who received Gardasil reported specific injection-site adverse event. Somewhat more male 
subjects reported systemic clinical adverse event in the group who received Gardasil compared with 
the  placebo  group.  The  most  common  systemic  reactions  were  headache,  pyrexia,  diarrhoea  and 
pharyngolaryngeal  pain.  A  higher  proportion  of  male  subjects,  who  received  Gardasil,  reported 
pyrexia compared with subjects in the non-aluminium containing placebo group.

Nine  to  15  years  old  male  subjects  who  received  Gardasil  reported  fewer  adverse  events  compared 
with  18  to  26  year  old  female  subjects.  The  proportions  of  male  and  female  subjects  who  reported 
serious adverse experiences were comparable. 
Fewer  male  subjects  who  received  Gardasil  reported  injection-site  reactions  or  systemic  clinical 
adverse events compared with 9- to 17-year-old female subjects. The proportions of 9- to 15-year-old 
subjects  who  reported  elevated  temperature  were  comparable  to  those  reported  by  9-  to  17-year-old 
female subjects. 
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  significant  difference  in  reactogenicity  and  safety  was  seen  between  subjects  receiving  Gardasil 
co-administered  with  hepatitis  B  vaccine  (recombinant)  and  subjects  receiving  placebo  co-
administered with hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant). The use of Gardasil concomitant with vaccines 
other  than  hepatitis  B  vaccine  has  not  been  studied.  The  safety  profile  for  the  concomitant

administration  of  Gardasil  and  hepatitis  B  vaccine  was  not  different  from  that  generally  seen  in  the 
safety summary for other studies and no safety concerns can be raised.  
In  clinical  studies,  57.5%  of  women  (age  16  to  26  years)  who  received  Gardasil  used  hormonal 
contraceptives.  Use  of  hormonal  contraceptives  did  not  appear  to  affect  the  immune  responses  to 
Gardasil. 
•  Post marketing experience 
Not applicable 
•  Discussion on clinical safety  
There was no major increase in the reactogenicity following Gardasil vaccination as compared to the 
placebo (aluminium-containing) administration. Pyrexia, pain, erythema and swelling at the injection 
site were the most common symptoms observed in both groups. Of note, local pain was less frequent 
after  non-aluminium-containing  placebo  administration.  Moreover,  the  data  from  the  studies  do  not 
indicate that the vaccine gives rise to anaphylactic reactions. 
All  fatalities  were  assessed  as  not  related  to  the  study  vaccines  by  the  investigators.  Most  of  the 
fatalities  can  be  explained  by  the  underlying  medical  condition  of  the  subject.  Five  fatalities  were 
caused by accidental events. 
Regarding the outcome of pregnancy occurring during the vaccination period it could be considered 
that  administration  of  Gardasil  had  no  impact  on  fertility.  The  rate  of  spontaneous  abortions  was 
higher in the group of 16 to 26 years of age compared with the placebo group. The elective abortions 
performed in recipients of Gardasil appeared not to be induced by any effects of the vaccine. There 
was no evidence that Gardasil reduced the proportion of pregnancies that resulted in a live birth of a 
normal  infant.  The  rate  of  late  foetal  deaths  was  not  different  in  the  Gardasil  group  compared  with 
placebo.  Congenital  anomalies  were  in  expected  ranges.  Although  there  were  differences  in 
distribution of congenital anomalies between the vaccination groups with EDCn within and not within 
30  days  from  any  vaccination,  respectively  the  overall  proportions  were  comparable  between  the 
vaccination groups. Furthermore, the recorded anomalies were all different and no prediction for any 
specific organ system could be identified. 
The  data  on  Gardasil  administered  during  pregnancy  did  not  indicate  any  safety  signal.  However, 
these  data  are  insufficient  to  recommend  use  of  Gardasil  during  pregnancy.  Vaccination  should, 
therefore, be postponed until after completion of pregnancy.

6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
During  the  evaluation  of  Gardasil,  no  major  objections  were  identified.  Minor  concerns  have  been 
adequately addressed, however several commitments are made by the applicant, and several follow-up 
measures are defined to provide further information post-approval. In conclusion all quality issues are 
resolved. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Studies in animal models with species-specific papillomaviruses have demonstrated the possibility to 
vaccinate  against  infection  and  development  of  tumour  lesions  using  virus-like  particles  formed  by 
recombinant  viral  capsid  proteins.  Protection  could  be  transferred  with  serum,  suggesting  that  the 
efficacy of Gardasil is mediated by development of humoral immune response.  
A  limited  toxicological  program  has  been  performed  with  Gardasil.  There  are  no  toxicological 
concerns arising from the non-clinical studies with the vaccine. Theoretically, the vaccine could give 
rise  to  antibodies,  which  cross-react  to  self-structures,  resulting  in  autoimmune  events.  Such 
possibility is not readily studied in experimental animal models, but can only be studied in the clinical 
situation. 
A reproductive toxicity study was performed in female rats, addressing all phases of reproduction and 
development.  An  immune  response  to  the  vaccine  was  observed,  and  antibodies  were  shown  to  be 
transferred  to  the  offspring  during  gestation  and  possibly  also  lactation.  There  were  no  adverse 
findings in the study. 
Efficacy 
The  clinical  development  program  for  the  Gardasil  vaccine  included  adequately  sized  studies  and 
involved altogether more than 20,000 women.

The  goal  of  the  clinical  development  program  for  Gardasil  was  to  prevent  cancer  lesions  related  to 
HPV  16  and  18.  High-grade  cervical  lesion  CIN  2/3  was  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  used  as  a 
surrogate marker for cervical cancer. Gardasil was administered without pre-screening for presence of 
HPV  infection.  The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  evaluated  in  the  per-protocol  efficacy  population 
(PPE),  consisting  of  subjects  who  received  all  3  vaccinations,  did  not  have  protocol  deviations  and 
were  naïve  to  the  relevant  HPV  type(s)  through  1  month  postdose  3.  In  the  two  pivotal  trials 
(FUTURE I and II) including over 17,500 young women aged 16 to 26 years, Gardasil was shown to 
prevent  100%  of  high-grade  cervical  precancers  (CIN  2/3)  and  non-invasive  cervical  cancers  (CIN 
3/adenocarcinoma  in  situ  (AIS))  associated  with  HPV  types  16  and  18  in  the  PPE  population.  The 
vaccine  also  proved  efficacious  against  low-grade  cervical  lesions  (CIN  1).  Several  modified-
intention-to-treat analyses including study participants who violated the protocol, received at least one 
dose or received at least two vaccine doses, supported the primary results. Efficacy was demonstrated 
for each of the 4 vaccine HPV types. In the ITT population (MITT-3), representing the general female 
population with or without HPV disease at enrolment, vaccine efficacy was substantially lower, 51% 
against CIN 2 and 44% against CIN 3/AIS. 
The  vaccine  was  also  evaluated  for  the  prevention  of  persistent  HPV  infection,  HPV  6/11/16/18-
related  vulvar  and  vaginal  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (VIN  and  VaIN)  and  genital  warts.  For  genitals 
warts, vaccine efficacy was shown in all study populations. With regard to HPV 16/18-related VIN 2/3 
and VaIN 2/3, there were too few cases in the per-protocol population to establish protective efficacy, 
but all cases occurred in the placebo group. In the MITT-2 population, representing the primary target 
population  in  clinical  practice,  consistent  and  statistically  significant  results  were  obtained  in  the 
combined  study  dataset  for  VIN  2/3  and  VaIN  2/3  (VE:  100%  with  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  at 
>20%). For VIN 2/3, vaccine efficacy was also established in several other relevant study populations, 
whereas there were too few cases of VaIN 2/3 to obtain significant results. In the MITT-3 population 
vaccine  efficacy  against  vulvar  and  vaginal  dysplastic  lesions  was  substantially  lower.  The  vaccine 
was  also  demonstrated  to  prevent  low-grade  lesions,  VIN  1  and  VaIN  1  (VE:  86%-100%)  although 
these  are  not  considered  clinically  relevant  endpoints.  Vaccine  efficacy  against  persistent  HPV 
infection was established for HPV 16 but not for HPV 18 due to too few cases. It can be concluded 
that with regard to external genital lesions, Gardasil was shown to be highly efficacious against genital 
warts  and  VIN  2/3.  For  VaIN  2/3  there  were  very  limited  number  of  cases,  but  taken  all  data  into 
consideration there was sufficient evidence supporting vaccine efficacy also against these lesions. 
Since the efficacy of HPV vaccines cannot be evaluated in sexually naïve subjects, immunogenicity 
was  studied  in  2800  virginal  boys  and  girls  aged  9  to  15  years  to  provide  a  basis  for  bridging  the 
efficacy of Gardasil obtained in young adult women. Anti HPV responses at Month 7 among 9- to 15-
year-old girls were non-inferior to anti-HPV responses in 16- to 26-year-old young women for whom 
efficacy was established in the phase III studies. At Month 18 GMTs remained 2- to 2.5-fold higher in 
adolescents compared with GMTs in adult women. The kinetics of immune responses up to Month 18 
were similar in both groups. Modelling demonstrated a strong positive relationship between Month 7 
GMTs  and  Month  18  GMTs,  and  for  women  Month  60  GMTs,  suggesting  that  anti-HPV  levels  in 
adolescents will remain higher than those associated with protective efficacy in adults over the long-
term.  Five-year  follow-up  of  adult  women  in  Protocol  007  showed  sustained  efficacy  with  no 
breakthroughs due to waning immunity. A booster administered at Month 60 to young women resulted 
in a strong anamnestic response suggesting that the vaccine induces an immune memory. Furthermore, 
mathematic  modelling  predicted  long-term  persistence  of  detectable  anti-HPV  levels.  The  Applicant 
has  agreed  to  perform  a  long-term  post-marketing  follow-up  of  immunogenicity  and  safety  in  an 
Adolescent  Sentinel  Cohort.  Taking  all  these  data  into  consideration  efficacy  bridging  from  adult 
women to girls is considered justified.  
Bridging immunogenic data to males is less obvious since there is no efficacy bridge to adult males. 
There  are  no  data  on  the  possible  correlation  between  immunogenicity  and  efficacy  of  Gardasil  in 
males.  Ongoing  efficacy  studies  in  males  will  address  this.  Although  HPV-related  infection  and 
disease  in  men  and  women  share  many  similarities  there  are  some  differences,  such  as  lower 
prevalence  of  specific  HPV  types  and  lower  antibody  response  to  natural  HPV  infection  in  men.  
However, the data from the clinical trials demonstrate that the HPV vaccine is immunogenic and well 
tolerated  in  boys.  Anti-HPV  responses  at  Month  7  among  9-  to  15-year  old  boys  were  higher  than 
those in girls of the same age group and non-inferior to the anti-HPV responses in 16- to 26 -year old 
females for whom efficacy was established in the phase III studies. Genital warts affect males at the 
same age-related rates as females, which could justify bridging. Furthermore, men are perceived as the

most  important  vectors  for  transmission  of  HPV  infection  to  women.  To  break  the  cycle  of  sexual 
transmission and attain herd immunity, males will have to be included in an immunisation program. At 
this stage it was deemed acceptable to mention in the SPC sections 4.1 and 5.1 that immunogenicity 
and  safety  of  Gardasil  has  been  shown  in  boys,  but  that  there  are  no  data  on  protective  efficacy  in 
males. 
The efficacy of Gardasil has only been demonstrated against diseases that are caused by HPV types 6, 
11, 16 and 18 and not against high-grade dysplastic genital lesions and cancers caused by non-vaccine 
types.  Therefore  routine  cervical  screening  remains  critically  important  and  should  follow  local 
recommendations. It was considered important to include this information in the SPC section 4.4 with 
a statement that vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. 
Safety 
The  general  safety  profile  of  Gardasil  is  considered  favourable.  The  methodologies  used  for  safety 
evaluation are established and appropriate. The safety database is large although for some separate age 
cohorts it might not sufficiently detect possibly precluded unexpected adverse reactions.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Specific studies of the vaccine in pregnant women were not conducted. However, during the clinical 
development  program,  2,266  women  (vaccine:  1,115  vs.  placebo:  1,151)  reported  at  least  one 
pregnancy. Overall, the numbers of pregnancies with an adverse outcome were comparable in subjects 
who  received  Gardasil  and  subjects  who  received  placebo.  For  pregnancies  with  estimated  onset 
within 30 days of vaccination, 5 cases of congenital anomaly were observed in the group that received 
Gardasil compared to 0 cases of congenital anomaly in the group that received placebo. Conversely, in 
pregnancies with onset more than 30 days following vaccination, 10 cases of congenital anomaly were 
observed  in  the  group  that  received  Gardasil  compared  with  16  cases  of  congenital  anomaly  in  the 
group  that  received  placebo.  The  types  of  anomalies  observed  were  consistent  with  those  generally 
observed in pregnancies in women aged 16 to 26 years. 
The  data  on  Gardasil  administered  during  pregnancy  did  not  indicate  any  safety  signal.  However, 
these  data  are  insufficient  to  recommend  use  of  Gardasil  during  pregnancy.  Vaccination  should, 
therefore, be postponed until after completion of pregnancy. 
A total of 995 breastfeeding mothers were given Gardasil or placebo during the vaccination period of 
the  clinical  trials.  The  rates  of  adverse  reactions  in  the  mother  and  the  breastfed  infant  were 
comparable between the vaccination and the placebo groups. In addition, vaccine immunogenicity was 
comparable  among  breastfeeding  mothers  and  women  who  did  not  breastfeed  during  the  vaccine 
administration. Gardasil can be given to breastfeeding women. 
Gardasil  has  not  been  studied  in  children  below  9  years  of  age.  Thus  the  use  of  vaccine  should  be 
avoided in that age group. There is need for more safety data in boys aged 9 to 16 years and also in the 
older group (16 to 23 years) of men. The safety profile of the adolescent group of boys was, however, 
comparable with the two female groups. 
Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. 
•  User consultation 
The  applicant  performed  readability  testing  (“user  consultation”)  and  a  satisfactory  report  has  been 
provided. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that: 
39/40

Pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were  needed  to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns.  
No  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
information. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Gardasil in “the prevention of high-grade cervical dysplasia 
(CIN  2/3),  cervical  carcinoma,  high-grade  vulvar  dysplastic  lesions  (VIN  2/3),  and  external  genital 
warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18. 
The indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Gardasil in adult females 16 to 26 years of 
age  and  on  the  demonstration  of  immunogenicity  of  Gardasil  in  9-  to  15-year  old  children  and 
adolescents.  Protective  efficacy  has  not  been  evaluated  in  males”  was  favourable  and  therefore 
recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

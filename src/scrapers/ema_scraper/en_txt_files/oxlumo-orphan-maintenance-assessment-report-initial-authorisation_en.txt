2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2016 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing synthetic double-stranded 
siRNA oligonucleotide directed against hydroxyacid oxidase 1 mRNA and covalently linked to a 
ligand containing three N-acetylgalactosamine residues was considered justified based on results 
from valid preclinical in vivo disease models showing that the product can reduce deregulated 
urinary oxalate levels; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent nephrolithiasis and 
progressive nephrocalcinosis leading to renal damage. The majority of the patients develop end 
stage renal disease during the 3rd to 5th decade of life; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.05 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
the sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment that has 
been authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The approved therapeutic indication “Treatment of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1) in all age 
groups” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of primary 
hyperoxaluria”. 
Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is an ultra-rare, progressive, serious and life-threatening, autosomal 
recessive inborn error of metabolism, resulting in increased endogenous hepatic production of oxalate, 
the key toxic metabolite responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. In addition to PH1, 
two other types of primary hyperoxaluria have been identified that result from different enzymatic 
defects; PH1 accounts for approximately 80% of PH cases and is the most clinically severe (Hoppe 
2012). 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP (see 
EPAR).

Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There have been no changes to the life-threatening and chronically debilitating nature of the condition 
since the granting of the orphan drug designation in 2016 and there have been no newly approved 
therapies since that time. 
PH1 can affect patients of all ages, but the serious and life-threatening aspects of the disease, 
including end stage renal disease (ESRD) and systemic oxalosis, often affect children under 18 years of 
age despite current standard of care. Approximately one quarter of all PH1 cases present as a severe 
infantile form of the disease, which is associated with a 5-fold higher risk of death compared to older 
patients with PH1 (Harambat, Fargue et al. 2010). Approximately one-third of PH1 patients experience 
recurrent kidney stones during childhood or early adulthood that require urologic procedures and 
hospitalizations that can have a serious impact on quality of life. 
The condition remains chronically debilitating and life threatening.  
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor performed a new calculation of prevalence of PH. The prevalence and sources of 
information collected for the frequency of Primary Hyperoxaluria included: Orphanet, 2013, van der 
Hoeven et al, 2012, van Woerden et al, 2003, Cochat et. al, 1995, Hoppe et al, 2005, Cochat et. al, 
1995, Kopp and Leumann 1995, van Woerden et al, 2003, Cochat et. al, 1995, Kopp and Leumann 
1995, Harambat et al, 2010 and Milliner, 2005. 
In summary, the prevalence of PH and PH1 remain unchanged since the orphan designation was 
granted in 2016.  Based on published literature, it is estimated that in the European Union PH affects a 
maximum of 0.05 in 10,000 people and PH1 affects a maximum of 0.04 in 10,000 people. This 
estimate is acceptable given the paucity of data and lack of indication that the prevalence changed. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Currently, there are no approved therapies for PH. As PH is a heterogeneous disease, management is 
guided by the stage of disease and associated complications. The goals of treatment in PH are to 
reduce levels of urinary and plasma oxalate, which directly cause the renal and extra-renal 
manifestations of this disease, respectively. The European Hyperoxaluria Consortium (OxalEurope) was 
established in 2008 to bring together European clinicians and scientists with the intent to provide 
diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients with PH (Cochat, Hulton et al. 2012). Some 
standard approaches for disease management include hyperhydration and inhibitors of crystallization, 
use of pyridoxine, use of dialysis and eventually kidney transplantation. 
Significant benefit 
Significant benefit is not applicable in this case.

4.  COMP position adopted on 19 October 2020 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of primary hyperoxaluria (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated 
to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.05 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent nephrolithiasis and 
progressive nephrocalcinosis leading to renal damage. Majority of the patients develop end stage 
renal disease during the 3rd to 5th decade of life; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method for the treatment that has been authorised in the 
European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Oxlumo, synthetic double-
stranded siRNA oligonucleotide directed against hydroxyacid oxidase 1 mRNA and covalently linked to 
a ligand containing three N-acetylgalactosamine residues, lumasiran, for treatment of primary 
hyperoxaluria (EU/3/16/1637) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal 
Products.

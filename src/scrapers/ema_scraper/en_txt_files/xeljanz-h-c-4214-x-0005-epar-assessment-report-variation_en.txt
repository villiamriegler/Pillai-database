2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication for the product which was proposed by the company was: Xeljanz is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an 
inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
UC is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disease of the colon characterized by alternating episodes of 
remission and spontaneous relapse. The prevalence has been estimated to range from 38 to 249 cases per 
100,000 persons in North America and 5 to 505 cases per 100,000 persons in Europe. It is most commonly 
diagnosed in late adolescence and early adulthood, with the peak incidence occurring between 20 to 39 years 
of age. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The precise pathogenesis of UC is presently unknown; however, the prevailing paradigm is dysregulation of 
the enteric immune response in genetically susceptible individuals.  This leads to upregulation of 
macrophages and type-2 T helper (Th2) lymphocytes in UC, as a result of inability to appropriately 
downregulate both innate and adaptive immune responses to endogenous luminal antigens. This produces an 
excess of cytokines, interleukins (ILs) and chemokines, all of which can lead to enhanced inflammation and 
tissue damage. Evidence has shown that upregulation of some of the common gamma chain cytokines may 
play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), of which the 2 main forms are UC and 
Crohn’s disease. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
The hallmark clinical presentations for UC include diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, passage of mucus, tenesmus, 
urgency, and abdominal pain. Patients may also experience fatigue, fevers, weight loss, and dehydration, 
particularly in more severe cases. Mortality is not increased in UC in general, but the disease may present as 
life-threatening fulminant colitis. Most patients follow a chronic intermittent course with periods of increased 
disease activity separated by periods of disease remission. After the initial diagnosis, approximately half of 
patients will have active disease at any single point in time and approximately 90% will have a disease 
course characterized by intermittent flares. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Current therapy for the treatment of UC includes 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), systemic and/or topical 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants such as azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and cyclosporine, and 
tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFis), and recently approved α4β7 integrin antagonist vedolizumab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 13/161 
  
  
A significant proportion of UC patients still require colectomy for refractory or severe fulminant disease, or in 
some cases for cancer prevention. Although patients with UC are often considered to be cured by restorative 
proctocolectomy, the quality of life may be poor and the surgery can be associated with short term and long-
term complications, including a decreased female fecundity and the development of pouchitis. At present, no 
current pharmacological therapy can provide a cure for UC. The primary treatment goal is to induce remission 
and then to maintain this state. 
About the product 
Tofacitinib is a selective JAK inhibitor, with a high degree of selectivity against other kinases in the human 
genome. In kinase assays, tofacitinib inhibits JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser extent tyrosine kinase 2 
(TYK2). In cellular settings where JAK kinases signal in pairs, tofacitinib preferentially inhibits signalling by 
heterodimeric receptors associated with JAK3 and/or JAK1 with functional selectivity over receptors that 
signal via pairs of JAK2. Accordingly, tofacitinib may result in modulation of the adaptive and innate immune 
response in IBD and may, therefore, be effective in interrupting the chronic cycle of GI inflammation. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This is an application for a Grouped Type II Variation (new indication) / Line Extension (10 mg new tablet 
strength) for Xeljanz (tofacitinib) in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC).   
No new clinical pharmacology studies or in vitro studies are included in this UC application. A population PK 
analysis and DER was performed of plasma tofacitinib concentration-time data from 1 Phase 2 and 2 identical 
Phase 3 induction studies, and 1 Phase 3 maintenance study in UC patients. Additionally, reference is made 
to population PK in RA and psoriasis (PsO) patients. 
Clinical efficacy and safety data are derived from one Phase 2 and three Phase 3 studies, and the MAH has 
submitted an interim clinical study report from an ongoing open-label, long-term extension study of 
tofacitinib in patients with UC. 
The applicant sought CHMP scientific advice in 2011 EMEA/H/SA/1219/4/2011/II. Follow-up advice regarding 
the UC program was sought in 2017 EMEA/H/SA/1219/4/FU/1/2016/II. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film coated tablets containing tofacitinib citrate, equivalent to 10 mg 
tofacitinib as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium and magnesium 
stearate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 14/161 
  
  
 
Film coating: hypromellose 6cP  (E464), titanium dioxide (E171), lactose monohydrate, macrogol 3350, 
triacetin (E1518), FD&C Blue #2/Indigo Carmine Aluminium Lake (E132),  and FD&C Blue #1/Brilliant Blue 
FCF Aluminium Lake (E133). 
The product is available in HDPE bottles with silica gel desiccant and child-resistant caps, and aluminium 
foil/PVC backed aluminium foil blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used in the manufacture of the new strength is the same as that used in the 
manufacture of the currently authorised Xeljanz 5 mg film-coated tablets (EU/1/17/1178/001-004). 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as blue, film coated, round tablet, debossed with“Pfizer” on one side and 
“JKI 10” on the other. 
Apart from the film coating, the composition of the proposed 10 mg tablet is qualitatively identical and 
quantitatively proportional to the approved 5 mg tablets. 
Both 5 mg and 10 mg tablets come from a common blend and are manufactured by the same conventional 
dry granulation process.  The quality target product profile (QTPP) for the proposed 10 mg strength was 
defined as blue, round, immediate release film-coated tablets containing 10 mg of tofacitinib that meet 
compendial and other relevant quality standards, packaged in blisters and bottles,  suitable for oral 
administration, twice daily, to adult patients. The formulation and process development was based on the 
Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) that is linked to the quality attributes. 
The critical quality attributes (CQAs) identified were appearance, identification, assay, degradants, uniformity 
of dosage units, disintegration, microbial limits, and water content. 
The active substance is classified as BCS Class III (high solubility and low permeability) compound. Due to 
the high-solubility, the particle size of the active substance is not restricted by dissolution considerations. The 
particle size distribution specification was established primarily based on the consideration of the finished 
product content uniformity. Mathematical modelling of content uniformity, small scale multivariate 
experiments and actual manufacturing experience were employed to establish the active substance particle 
size specification. 
A formulation containing microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate 
was selected. This was based on the results of an excipient compatibility study and desired mechanical 
properties. Chemical compatibility studies were performed with the active substance and excipients typically 
used for dry granulation formulations to identify a suitable formulation. The selection of the excipients was 
based on data from a 6-week open dish accelerated stability study using different blends of excipients and 
active substance.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards except the coating and printing ink which comply with in-house standards. There are no novel

excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
A material attributes risk assessment was conducted to identify which active substance and excipient 
properties could potentially impact the finished product quality or the manufacturing process. The active 
substance particle size, raw material water content, and excipient batch-to-batch variability were identified as 
potentially important formulation factors. 
A three arm study was used to demonstrate the bioequivalence among 10 mg commercial tablet, 5 mg Phase 
3 tablet, and 5 mg Phase 2 tablet. Since the 5 mg and 10 mg commercial tablets use a common blend and 
share the same manufacturing process, the equivalence between the 5 mg and 10 mg commercial tablets 
was demonstrated by the in vitro dissolution test. The results of the bioequivalence study demonstrated that 
the 10 mg commercial tablet, 5 mg Phase 3 tablet, and 5 mg Phase 2 tablet are bioequivalent.  
The in vitro dissolution test demonstrated similar dissolution profiles between the 5 mg and 10 mg 
commercial tablets. 
A  dissolution  method  is  performed  in  accordance  with  the  following  standard  dissolution  test  conditions: 
Apparatus I (baskets) at 100 RPM, 0.1N HCl, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. In order to 
select the the optimum dissolution conditions standard media screening (0.1N HCl, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and 
pH 6.8 phosphate buffer) was performed using Apparatus I (basket) at 100 RPM and Apparatus II (paddles) 
at 50 and 75 RPM. The conclusions from the method screening study are: the dissolution profiles generated 
under  same  agitation  conditions  are  consistent  across  pH,  the  dissolution  profiles  using  50  RPM  paddle 
showed slower onset release, which is attributed to the coning effect, no coning effect was observed with 75 
RPM paddles and 100 RPM basket, rapid dissolution was achieved for both conditions.  
Further  evaluation  of  aberrations  in  the  formulation  was  performed,  including  changes  in  the  composition 
including the lubricant amount, disintegrant content and also an increase in tablet hardness. The results have 
been  presented.  Due  to  the  nature  of  Xeljanz  tablets,  appropriate  discrimination  using  dissolution  is  not 
feasible.  Although  Apparatus  I  at  100  rpm  in  0.1  N  HCl  showed  no  ability  to  discriminate  the  aberrant 
formulations, it was chosen as the most suitable dissolution method for comparison between the two tablet 
strengths (5 mg and 10 mg). 
The rapid release characteristics of the proposed product has been demonstrated on the development and 
registration stability batches. For the 10 mg tablets, disintegration has shown to be able to detect differences 
in the high hardness tablets versus the control. Since disintegration offers slightly better discriminatory 
capability against the aberrant formulations, disintegration is considered a more suitable performance 
method for evaluating tablets than dissolution. The same approach had also been adopted for the approved 5 
mg tablets. 
The tablets are manufactured by a conventional dry granulation process that includes blending, milling, blend 
lubrication, roller compaction and milling, blend lubrication, compression, and aqueous based film coating.  
A staged risk assessment was conducted to evaluate the quality attributes and process parameters 
associated with the manufacturing process. Initially, a failure-mode effect-criticality analysis (FMECA) was 
conducted to establish the critical and non-critical quality attributes of the finished product. This assessment 
considered the quality target product profile (QTPP), the biopharmaceutical properties of finished product, 
and prior manufacturing experience. Focus areas (FA) were then defined, and a cause-and-effect analysis 
was performed on each focus area to assess the potential impact of the process parameters and upstream 
material properties on the quality attributes listed in the QTPP. Following each risk assessment, a

comprehensive experimental plan was developed to study selected process parameters in each of the focus 
areas utilizing multivariate and univariate experiments, as well as engineering models. The goal of these 
studies was to generate the knowledge space that could be used to establish the design space (see below in 
Manufacture of the product and process controls). A summary of the process parameters and quality 
attributes evaluated was presented and considered satisfactory. 
Uniformity of dosage units and the level of degradants observed during stability studies were identified as the 
critical quality attributes (CQA) that could be impacted by the formulation or manufacturing process. A series 
of statistically designed studies sought the functional relationships between the process parameters and 
these two CQAs. The knowledge gained from these studies, in conjunction with prior experience, provided the 
basis for a 3-tier system for designating the criticality of all parameters as follows: 1) critical process 
parameters (CPP), 2) key process parameters (KPP), and 3) non-critical process parameters (non- CPP). The 
3-tier system was later changed to a 2-tier system (CPPs /non-CPPs only) to be aligned with the terminology 
defined by ICH Q8. 
Process knowledge and process design space were established through univariate, multivariate and modelling 
studies performed for initial blending, dry granulation and compression, film coating and packaging process 
steps. The manufacturing process design space described for the 10 mg strength is identical to that of the 
already authorised 5 mg tablets which has been evaluated and accepted. Overall, the knowledge space has 
been systematically investigated to identify the relationship of process parameters to the quality attributes. 
The proven acceptable range for each process parameter has been established and the target values are 
appropriately specified. 
The primary packages are HDPE bottles with silica gel desiccant and child-resistant caps or aluminium 
foil/PVC backed aluminium foil unit dose blisters. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 10 main steps. In summary, the excipients are blended, dry 
granulated and then compressed to form the tablet core.  The core is then film-coated with Opadry and 
packed into the proposed container closure system. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
Design spaces have been proposed for the following steps of the manufacturing process of the medicinal 
product: dry granulation and milling. The design space has been developed at commercial scale. The 
available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale 
batches fully support the proposed design space. The available development data, the proposed control 
strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. The 
manufacturing process design space described for the 10 mg strength is identical to that of the already 
authorised 5 mg strength which has been evaluated and accepted. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.

Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications,  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance/identification  (visual),  identification  (UV,  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units 
(HPLC), degradation products (HPLC, disintegration (Ph Eur), water content (KF), microbial limits. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. No additional reference standards or materials are used for the testing of the finished 
product other than those of the active substance. 
The rationale for the performance of disintegration testing instead of dissolution has been adequately 
discussed and is accepted. The limit of disintegration time is set at 7 minutes which is supported by the batch 
data. 
A risk assessment of the elemental impurities in the finished product has been conducted in line with the 
requirements of the ICH Q3D guideline (EMA/CHMP/ICH/353369/2013). The potential sources of EIs from the 
active substance, excipients, manufacturing equipment and utilities, and packaging components were 
evaluated and based on these evaluations as well as batch testing no additional control is deemed necessary. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 7 commercial and pilot scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of the finished product packaged in high density polyethylene 
(HDPE) bottles with desiccant and in foil/foil blisters stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions 
(25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  intermediate  conditions  (30oC/75  %)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  are  identical  to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in both types of primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
The samples were tested for appearance, assay and degradation products, as well as water content, 
dissolution, chiral purity, disintegration and microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. The data from the long term and accelerated stability studies demonstrated that there 
were no significant trends observed in any of the measured parameters.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. The exposed samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation 
products, water content, dissolution, disintegration and hardness. No significant changes were observed in 
any of the parameters measured. It is therefore concluded that the tablets are stable to light and no 
precautionary packaging/labelling is required. 
An open dish in use stability study was carried out. Samples were removed from the package and stored in 
an open dish at 30oC/75 % RH and tested after 2 and 4 weeks for appearance, assay and degradation 
products, water content, dissolution and disintegration.  The results showed that the exposed tablets 
absorbed moisture; however, this did not impact the stability, quality and performance of the product as 
measured by the other test attributes.

The foil/foil blister is actively tested for all lots. A bracketing design is applied to the testing for the HDPE 
bottle packages. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its manufacturing 
process. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the manufacture of the finished product. The 
design spaces have been adequately verified. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Tofacitinib (compound number: CP-690,550-10 [citrate salt]) is an oral, potent, selective inhibitor of Janus 
kinase (JAK) family of kinases with a high degree of selectivity against other kinases in the human genome.  
In kinase assays, tofacitinib inhibits JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser extent tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). In 
cellular settings where JAK kinases signal in pairs, tofacitinib preferentially inhibits signalling by heterodimeric 
receptors associated with JAK3 and/or JAK1 with functional selectivity over receptors that signal via pairs of

Page 19/161 
  
  
 
JAK2.  The modulatory effects of JAK inhibition on multiple cytokine pathways central to the pathogenesis of 
UC could provide a scientific rationale for developing tofacitinib in the treatment of UC.   
No new non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics or toxicology data were generated since the original 
application for RA was completed.  All reports that support either 5 or 10 mg dosing were previously provided 
and are therefore have not been revisited.  The applicant has provided updated discussions in the non-clinical 
overview, and new information not previously submitted to the RA dossier.  An updated environmental risk 
assessment (ERA) is provided.   
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The primary pharmacology, secondary pharmacology and safety pharmacology section have previously been 
reviewed in the submission for RA and so are not reviewed again here.  A brief summary to support the proof 
of concept of utilising tofacitinib in the treatment of OC is provided.   
Multiple functions behind the cellular response in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are thought to be 
regulated by multiple cytokines, which in turn would signal to a variety of JAKs.  The γ-common cytokines, 
IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, all signal through the activation of JAK1/JAK3 and are associated with 
modulation of the adaptive immune function, including B-cell maturation and Th1, Th2, and Th17 
differentiation (Hofmann et al, 2002).  Tofacitinib is a potent inhibitor of the JAK kinase family, with a high 
degree of selectivity within the human kinome (Karaman et al, 2008).  As a result, tofacitinib will block the 
signalling pathways of the γ-common cytokines by inhibiting JAK1 and JAK3.  
It is predicted that tofacitinib will modestly inhibit IL-12 and IL-23 signalling through the combination of JAK2 
and TYK2 and regulate innate immune responses, differentiation of Th1 and Th17, and production of pro-
inflammatory cytokines (Langrish et al, 2004).   
IL-13 signals through JAK1 and either JAK2 or TYK2 and is an important effector cytokine associated with 
impaired barrier function in IBD (Heller et al, 2005).  As a result, JAK pathways are central to both innate and 
adaptive immune responses in IBD, playing critical roles in T-cell differentiation, B-cell development, and 
production of mucus and antibodies required to maintain anti-viral and anti-bacterial defenses at the mucosal 
surface (Heneghan et al, 2013). 
Due to the combination of these factors, tofacitinib may result in modulation of the adaptive and innate 
immune responses found in IBD and therefore may be effective in interrupting the chronic cycle of 
gastrointestinal inflammation (Sandborn et al, 2012). 
No nonclinical pharmacology models of IBD were conducted to evaluate tofacitinib since the overall clinical 
predictability of these models is low. 
The applicant has presented a number of literature articles suggesting the contribution of the range of JAKs 
on the possible immune modulation involved in the pathogenesis of IBD.  Tofacitinib is an identified inhibitor 
of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser extent tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), so it is plausible that it may have 
activity in treating conditions such as UC.  No new non-clinical pharmacology studies have been performed.  
The applicant has argued that animal models of UC are not predictive of the clinical disease, although this has 
not been elaborated to any extent.  Clinical efficacy studies have been completed and an overall judgement 
on its effectiveness to treat UC will be clinically determined.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic studies were provided in this submission.  Reference is made to the earlier 
submission and to studies completed during the assessment of RA application.  Although no new data is 
presented, new exposure margins based upon the increased dosage for UC patients has been supplied.  This 
is based upon exposures generated during the non-clinical development programme for tofacitinib, however 
using unbound free plasma concentrations determined in clinical study PMAR-00178.  Comparison is made 
between the 5 mg BID and10 mg BID, with exposure margins approximately halving in line with increasing 
exposure in humans.  Overall there is no distinct change in the non-clinical assessment of this data, 
conclusions on exposure margins are similar to that made for the original application for RA. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The applicant has not provided any new toxicological study data, reference is made to studies completed in 
support of the RA submission.  The scope and range of studies previously supplied are extensive and 
sufficient to support the change in indication and the subsequent change in posology, 5 mg BID to 10 mg 
BID.  Safety margins reveal no additional non-clinical concern.   
Tofacitinib was teratogenic (visceral and skeletal abnormalities) in rats and rabbits, with evidence of 
decreased pregnancy rates, decreases in corpora lutea, implantation sites, and viable fetuses, and an 
increase in early resorptions.  There is also reduced pup survival and number in the peri/post-natal 
development study in rats.  Tofacitinib is contraindicated in use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, in line 
with other indications of use.  Sections 4.3, 4.6 and 5.3 are acceptable. 
The drug substance, tofacitinib citrate has previously been assessed as part of the RA submission.  Seven 
drug substance impurities are specified and have been qualified from toxicity batches used in the non-clinical 
testing programme.  The applicant has supplied sufficient information regarding each of these impurities, all 
are non-genotoxic and each are sufficiently qualified. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has provided a full ERA in support of this line extension and change in treatment indication.  
Approval of the new strength and to a new treatment population would be expected to increase the overall 
exposure, hence this updated document is required in line with the CHMP guidance EMEA/CHMP/ 
SWP/4447/00 entitled; “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
Use”.  
The study on transformation in water sediment system (OECD 308) shows that the active ingredient 
tofacitinib citrate is very persistent in sediment considering the DT50 values of 273 d and 350 d at 12°C (128 
d and 164 d at 20°C) and persistent in water with DT50 of 65.7 d at 12°C (30.8 d at 20°C). These values are 
based on recalculations by DE-UBA using the degradation kinetic model Modelmaker 4.0.  This is included in 
the table below.  
Tofacitinib is already used as an existing marketed product and although an increase in environmental 
exposure is anticipated with the added new treatment population, considering the above data, tofacitinib is 
not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  The compound is considered as P in water, and vP in 
sediment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Tofacitinib is potent, selective JAK inhibitor, with a high degree of selectivity against other kinases in the 
human genome.  It is already orally administered to treat RA, and given its novel mechanism of action in 
inhibiting of the JAK family of kinases it has potential to have effect on immune modulatory effects linked 
with the pathogenesis of UC.  The applicant has not provided any new non-clinical data to support this 
application, reference is made to completed studies submitted in support of XELJANZ 5 mg tablets to treat 
RA.   
The applicant’s position for providing no new non-clinical data to support the 10 mg tablet and change in 
treatment population (ulcerative colitis) in this grouped line extension and Type II variation is acceptable.   
Impurities in the drug substance have been adequately qualified.  
An environmental risk assessment has been provided for tofacitinib, this does not highlight any significant 
risk posed to the environment, although shows evidence of persistence in water and in sediment.   
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical perspective, the marketing authorisation of XELJANZ 10 mg tablets to treat ulcerative 
colitis is supported. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The applicant has conducted 1 Phase 2 and 3 Phase 3 studies, and has submitted an interim clinical study 
report from an ongoing open-label, long-term extension study of tofacitinib in patients with UC.  
The phase 2 dose finding study evaluated a 30-fold dose range (0.5, 3, 10, and 15 mg BID) in moderately to 
severely active UC patients. 
The pivotal phase 3 studies consisted of two identically conducted studies to investigate efficacy in induction 
of remission (studies A3921094 and A3921095) and one examining efficacy in maintenance of remission 
study A3921096). 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The following Phase 1 and in vitro studies were previously submitted as part of the Marketing Authorization 
Application (MAA) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA): Nineteen in vitro studies with human biomaterials relevant to 
PK processes and Twenty-Five Phase 1 studies comprising 20 clinical pharmacology and 5 biopharmaceutics 
studies. No new clinical pharmacology studies or in vitro studies are included in this UC application. A

population analysis and DER was performed of plasma tofacitinib concentration-time data from 1 Phase 2 and 2 
identical Phase 3 induction studies, and 1 Phase 3 maintenance study in UC patients. 
A summary of the ADME properties is provided: 
• 
• 
Following oral administration, systemic exposure of tofacitinib increases in an approximately dose 
proportional manner in healthy subjects 
The apparent terminal half-life (t½) of tofacitinib is approximately 3 hours 
•  Steady-state PK is predictable from single dose data. Upon multiple dosing, steady-state is achieved 
within 24-48 hours with negligible accumulation 
• 
Tofacitinib is rapidly absorbed and has an absolute bioavailability of 74% after oral administration 
•  Approximately 39% of circulating tofacitinib is bound to plasma proteins 
•  Clearance mechanisms for tofacitinib are approximately 70% hepatic metabolism and 30% renal 
excretion of the parent drug 
• 
The metabolism of tofacitinib is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 with minor contribution from CYP2C19 
•  All human circulating and excreted metabolites have been observed at <8% of total radioactivity and 
have been observed in animal species and are predicted to have ≤10% of the potency of tofacitinib 
for Janus Kinase (JAK) 1/3 inhibition 
For the POPPK model, a 1-compartment model parameterised in terms of apparent oral clearance (CL/F), 
apparent volume of distribution (V/F), and first-order absorption adequately described the plasma 
concentration-time profile of tofacitinib in UC patients.  Plasma clearance (23.7 L/h) is slightly higher than 
that estimated for RA patients and similar to that in PsO patient, however the exposures are expected to be 
similar and within 20% of the exposure in RA patients. Inter-subject variability (percent coefficient of 
variation [%CV]) in AUC 24 was generally similar across UC, RA and PsO patients (23%, 27% and 28%, 
respectively). Based on the demonstrated lack of time-dependence of tofacitinib clearance, plasma tofacitinib 
exposure at a given dose in individual UC patients is expected to be stable (ie, not change significantly) 
during the course of induction and maintenance treatment. Dose modification or restrictions for age, body 
weight, sex, race, ethnicity, or baseline disease severity (eg, baseline Mayo score and baseline albumin), to 
account for differences in exposure, are not required. There was <20% estimated difference in AUC or 
maximum concentration (Cmax) between a reference patient with a typical value and those with values at 
the tails of the distributions of patient-specific factors that were statistically significant in the PK model. 
Based on the overall comparability of tofacitinib PK profile between UC and RA patients, the proposed dosing 
adjustment recommendations derived for RA patients, primarily based on Phase 1 clinical pharmacology 
studies, are also applicable in patients with UC. Consistent with the current Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) for RA, it is recommended that: In UC patients with severe renal impairment or 
moderate hepatic impairment: 
• 
the recommended dose is XELJANZ 5 mg BID when the indicated dose in the presence of normal 
renal and hepatic function is XELJANZ 10 mg BID, 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 26/161 
  
  
 
 
 
• 
• 
the recommended dose is XELJANZ 5 mg QD when the indicated dose in the presence of normal renal 
and hepatic function is XELJANZ 5 mg BID 
In UC patients receiving potent inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or 
one (1) or more concomitant medications that result in both moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 and 
exhibit potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (eg, fluconazole): the recommended dose is half the daily dose 
indicated for patients not receiving these CYP inhibitors, ie, in patients already taking: 
•  XELJANZ 10 mg BID, reduce the dose to XELJANZ 5 mg BID or 
•  XELJANZ 5 mg BID, reduce the dose to XELJANZ 5 mg QD. 
Tofacitinib has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh 
classification system. Tofacitinib is contraindicated in UC patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Co-administration of tofacitinib to UC patients with potent inducers of CYP3A4, such as rifampin, may result 
in loss of or reduced clinical response. 
Phase 1 drug-drug interaction studies and in vitro studies indicate the potential for tofacitinib to affect the PK 
of other drugs, including those metabolized by CYP450 isoforms, is low. The drugs evaluated for interactions 
included midazolam, oral contraceptives, methotrexate and metformin. 
In vitro data indicated that tofacitinib does not inhibit or induce the CYP450 system, which was confirmed in a 
Phase 1 drug interaction study with midazolam, a highly sensitive CYP3A substrate. There was no effect of 
tofacitinib on the PK of oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel) or metformin (an organic 
cation transporter [OCT] substrate). 
In vitro studies also indicate: There is low potential for tofacitinib to influence the metabolism of co-
administered drugs that are metabolized by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. The 
potential for tofacitinib to inhibit transporters such as P-glycoprotein, organic anion transporting polypeptide 
(OATP) 1B1 or 1B3 (OATP1B1 or OATP1B3), or OCT-2 is low. Tofacitinib is not a substrate for breast cancer 
resistance protein, OCT1 or OCT2, or OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
Exposure-Response Relationships for Efficacy 
Using pooled data from Phase 3 induction studies (A3921094 and A3921095), predicted placebo-adjusted 
probability of remission (primary endpoint) and mucosal healing (key secondary endpoint) were 12.7% and 
17.8%, respectively, at 10 mg BID. 
Comparison of predicted probability of remission and mucosal healing in the induction studies at the expected 
Cavg values for 5 mg and 10 mg BID indicated lower efficacy at 5 mg BID. The predicted placebo-adjusted 
probability of remission of 6.36% at 5 mg BID is not likely to be clinically meaningful. Although 15 mg BID 
was initially included in the induction studies, this dose was discontinued soon after study initiation as it was 
not considered an optimal induction dose. Therefore, E-R characterization of efficacy in the induction studies 
supports 10 mg BID as the induction dose for moderate to severe UC patients.  Covariate evaluation 
indicated that baseline Mayo score and prior tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) failure status were 
significant predictors of response, in addition to tofacitinib exposure, in the E-R models for remission and

mucosal healing. Predicted placebo-adjusted probability for remission and mucosal healing at Week 8 were 
inversely related to baseline Mayo score. Predicted placebo adjusted probability for remission and mucosal 
healing were generally similar between subjects who had previously failed TNFi and those who had not failed 
TNFi previously. Longitudinal E-R analysis of partial Mayo scores at Week 2, 4, and 8 indicated that onset of 
efficacy was rapid, with 68% of Week 8 effect achieved by Week 2. 
Relative increase in model predicted efficacy response at Week 52 between 5 mg and 10 mg BID was 27% 
for remission among patients in remission at the maintenance baseline (ie, those who achieved remission 
during induction), and 30% for remission among non-remitters at baseline; 41% and 44%, respectively, for 
mucosal healing among patients in mucosal healing, and those who were not in mucosal healing, at baseline; 
and 34% for sustained steroid free remission among remitters at baseline. Therefore, predicted response at 
the 10 mg BID maintenance dose was 27% to 44% higher relative to 5 mg BID in the overall population, 
across the primary and key secondary endpoints.  Estimated EC50 from base Markov models for remission, 
mucosal healing, and steroid free remission were 16.2, 40.3, and 14.3 ng/mL, respectively. The EC50 for 
remission was similar to the geometric mean Cavg at 5 mg BID (16.8 ng/mL), indicating that 5 mg BID is the 
approximate ED50 for remission. The geometric mean Cavg at 10 mg BID (33.6 ng/mL) corresponds to ED68 on 
the E-R curve for remission. In the subgroup of patients who previously failed TNFi, the relative increase in 
predicted probability of remission at Week 52 between 5 mg and 10 mg BID was 41%. Among those who had 
not failed TNFi previously, the increase was 19%, indicating that these patients were more likely to derive 
greater benefit from the 10 mg BID maintenance dose than patients who had not previously failed TNFi. 
Placebo-adjusted probability of remission at Week 52 was 29% and 41% among baseline remitters at Cavg 
values corresponding to 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively. Among baseline non-remitters, the Week 52 
placebo-adjusted probability of remission from the Markov E-R model was 18% and 26% at 5 mg and 10 mg 
BID, respectively. This indicates higher maintenance efficacy among patients more responsive (ie, achieving 
remission) to induction treatment. Based on the longitudinal logistic regression model that included the effect 
of prior TNFi failure, predicted placebo-adjusted probability of remission at Week 52 among prior TNFi failures 
was 14% and 24% at 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively. Among patients who had not failed TNFi previously, 
predicted placebo-adjusted remission probability was 29% and 36% at 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, 
indicating higher efficacy at both doses in this less refractory population.  
Covariate evaluation using a multivariate analysis approach indicated that baseline Mayo score, age, and oral 
steroid use at baseline of maintenance were significant predictors in the final models for remission and 
mucosal healing. Prior TNFi failure status was not a significant covariate in the final models possibly due to 
correlation with other predictors. Probability of remission and mucosal healing was inversely correlated with 
baseline Mayo score. Oral steroid use at maintenance baseline was associated with lower probability of 
remission and mucosal healing at Week 52. There was a small positive correlation between probability of 
remission and age.

Exposure-Response Relationships for Safety 
Overall, there was a trend for increase in estimated incidence rates (IR) of AEs with increasing tofacitinib 
exposure. However, except for HZ, the estimated IR at 10 mg and 5 mg BID were not significantly different, 
based on the ratio of IR (risk ratio) and 95% confidence interval (CI): The estimated risk ratio of 10 mg BID 
versus (vs) 5 mg BID doses of tofacitinib and 95% CI, from models using mean Cavg (MCAV) as predictor, 
were 1.12 (95% CI: 0.642, 1.95) for SI, 1.85 (95% CI: 0.857, 3.98) for OI, 1.84 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.79) for 
HZ, and 2.33 (95% CI: 0.863, 6.28) for NMSC. 
E-R for ALT and AST indicated a small increase in enzyme concentration with tofacitinib exposure. The 
estimated mean (95% CI) difference from placebo for ALT was 1.86 (0.84, 2.88) IU/L and 3.72 (1.68, 5.76) 
IU/L at the geometric mean Cavg values in the 5 mg and 10 mg BID dose groups, respectively. Similarly, 
estimated mean (95% CI) difference from placebo for AST was 1.98 (1.21, 2.75) IU/L and 3.96 (2.41, 5.50) 
IU/L at the geometric mean Cavg values in the 5 mg and 10 mg BID dose groups, respectively. There was a 
trend for a small decrease in Hgb with increasing tofacitinib exposure, which was not statistically significant in 
maintenance. There was no significant change in NEU as a function of tofacitinib exposure during induction or 
maintenance. There was no statistically significant change in ALC with time or tofacitinib exposure during 
induction, and a trend for a decrease in ALC over time was observed during the maintenance phase, 
consistent with such decreases observed in the RA and PsO programs following long term treatment. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The scientific rationale behind the use of Xeljanz in UC is based on its ability to block the signalling pathways 
of the γ -common cytokines by inhibiting JAK1 and JAK3. Cellular functions associated with the immune 
response in IBD are believed to be regulated by multiple different cytokines, which, in turn, signal through 
different combinations of JAKs. The primary and secondary pharmacology of tofacitinib has been well 
described and reviewed in the initial application. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No specific drug interaction studies have been submitted in this variation application. Co-administration with 
the more commonly used UC drugs (e.g., 5-ASA and corticosteroids) was not studied. In clinical practice co- 
administration with these drugs is likely. The MAH considered that the routes of elimination of 5-ASA and 
corticosteroids render the likelihood of interaction to be low. Tofacitinib is not expected to impact on the PK 
of 5-ASA, based on the lack of overlap in elimination pathways. No CYP-mediated metabolism by 5-ASA or its 
metabolite is reported, and no effect of 5-ASA co-administration on tofacitinib exposure is expected. For 
corticosteroids, no clinically relevant inhibition or induction of CYP enzymes have been reported, and the lack 
of effect of tofacitinib on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a probe CYP3A4 substrate, was demonstrated. 
Therefore, concomitant administration of these corticosteroids is not expected to impact the PK of tofacitinib, 
and no impact of tofacitinib on the PK of corticosteroids is expected.  Evaluation of concomitant corticosteroid

use as a covariate in the population PK analysis of tofacitinib in UC patients, using pooled data from Phase 2 
and Phase 3 studies, indicated that there was no effect of corticosteroid co-administration on the PK of 
tofacitinib.  Concomitant corticosteroid use at baseline of Phase 3 induction studies in UC patients was 
evaluated as a covariate in exposure-response models for efficacy and safety (adverse events [AEs] of 
special interest).  Concomitant corticosteroid use was not found to be a significant predictor of AEs such as 
serious infections, opportunistic infections, or herpes zoster in UC patients. However, in other indications 
such as RA, increase incidence of AEs have been observed with concomitant corticosteroid use as may be 
expected based on the immunosuppressant effects of steroids.  Corticosteroid use was also not a significant 
predictor in the exposure response model for the primary induction efficacy endpoint of remission, but was 
significant for some secondary efficacy endpoints, as may be expected based on the pharmacodynamic (PD) 
activity of corticosteroids.  
It is reported that genetic polymorphisms in the JAK/STAT pathway have been associated with UC in humans. 
The MAH provided details of a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes associated with 
inflammatory bowel disease that may be considered candidate loci to query when looking for differential 
effects of tofacitinib in UC.  In study A3921063 samples were taken for pharmacogenomic studies to examine 
the genetic basis of drug response,  and the MAH has confirmed that DNA samples from patients collected in 
the UC trial programme are currently being genotyped via SNP arrays, and data derived may be useful for 
future identification of differential efficacy/safety effects of tofacitinib. 
Extensive DER modelling has been performed and this supports the dose of 10 mg for efficacy for induction 
and the 5mg for maintenance of remission. There is an increased risk of some of the safety parameters 
studied e.g. HZ and opportunistic infections at the higher dose however this is not statistically significant. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics have been well described in previous applications.  Phase 3 data was used to further 
investigate important covariates on the PK and these were found to be consistent with other findings.  The 
primary and secondary pharmacology of tofacitinib has been well described and reviewed in the initial 
application. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From a pharmacological perspective, the application for marketing authorisation of XELJANZ 10 mg tablets to 
treat ulcerative colitis is supported. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study A3921063 was a randomised, placebo controlled study conducted to evaluate a 30-fold dose range 
(0.5, 3, 10, and 15 mg BID) in moderately to severely active UC patients. The study was subject-, 
investigator-, and sponsor-blinded. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate efficacy of CP-690,550 in inducing a clinical response in subjects 
with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 30/161 
  
  
responders at Week 8. Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in Mayo score of at least 3 
points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1 
point or an absolute sub-score for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1. 
The study design and length of the study of 8 weeks, which although is at the lower end of the acceptable 
length, is acceptable. Randomisation was stratified according to disease activity which was appropriate.  
The primary efficacy point utilised did not include a separate evaluation on endoscopic subscore and this 
limits clinical interpretation of the results as both clinical symptom improvement and mucosal healing are 
imperative in assessing clinical response. This was not considered to be a significant concern as this was an 
exploratory phase 2 dose finding study. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, which was clinical response 47.5%, 29.6%, 51.6%, 63.3%, and 80% of 
subjects (FAS) in the placebo and CP-690,550 0.5 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg treatment groups, 
respectively, achieved a clinical response at Week 8. The lower doses of 0.5mg and 3mg were substantially 
less efficacious than the 10mg and 15mg doses.  
The secondary efficacy endpoint of clinical remission was defined as a total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, 
with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and as such did encompass both aspects of symptomatic and 
endoscopic remission. For the secondary efficacy endpoints, 12.2%, 7.4%, 35.5%, 50%, and 42.2% of 
subjects (FAS) in the placebo and CP-690,550 0.5 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg treatment groups, 
respectively, were in clinical remission at Week 8. Based on the primary and secondary endpoints there was 
evidence of statistically significant effect for the 10mg and 15 mg but not the 0.5 and 3mg. 
Based on the linear mixed-effects model analysis of the partial Mayo scores, a statistically significant 
difference from placebo was observed at Week 2 in the tofacitinib 10 mg and 15 mg BID treatment groups. 
The tofacitinib doses evaluated in the Phase 3 induction studies (A3921094 and A3921095) were selected 
based on dose-response modelling of efficacy data from the Phase 2, study A3921063. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The main studies were from the phase 3 program, which consisted of  2 completed, identically designed 8-
week induction studies (A3921094 and A3921095) with tofacitinib 10 mg BID or placebo, 1 separate 
completed 52-week maintenance study (A3921096) with tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID or 
placebo, and 1 ongoing open-label LTE study (A3921139) with tofacitinib 5 mg BID and tofacitinib 10 mg 
BID.

STUDIES A3921094 and A3921095 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Subjects were selected based on a diagnosis (endoscopic or radiographic and histological) of UC >4 months 
prior to entry into the study, with a histological confirmation. Moderately to severely active disease was 
defined by a total Mayo score of >6, with a rectal bleeding score of >1, and an endoscopic subscore of >2 on 
the Mayo score determined within 10 days of baseline visit. Appropriate measures of diagnosis and disease 
severity were utilised for subject selection.  
Subjects had failed or been intolerant of at least 1 of the oral or intravenous (IV) corticosteroids; 
Azathioprine, 6-MP; or TNFi therapy: infliximab or adalimumab. 
The enrolled population is representative of the anticipated UC treatment population for tofacitinib in the 
proposed indication. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized to either tofacitinib 10 mg BID or placebo BID, with a treatment allocation ratio of 
4:1. Subjects were stratified by previous treatment with TNFi therapy, oral corticosteroid use at baseline, and 
geographic region. Active treatment in the study continued for 8 weeks which was an acceptable length of 
time. 
At entry into the induction studies, subjects were permitted to continue oral corticosteroids or 5-ASA for UC. 
The continuation of background therapy was acceptable, considering the proposed indication and is consistent 
with CHMP guidance CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the 
treatment of Ulcerative Colitis. Chronic treatment for UC with antibiotics was permitted, it would be expected 
that antibiotic use would be excluded, per the Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for

the treatment of ulcerative colitis, which states that “Antibiotics should normally be excluded and in severe 
disease, anti-cholinergic, anti-diarrhoeal, NSAID and opioid drugs should not be allowed as they may 
contribute to worsening of the relapse.” The MAH has clarified that the number of patients who received 
concomitant antibiotics for UC treatment was 6/905 (0.7%) of the patients receiving tofacitinib 10mg BID in 
the induction studies and has provided adequate justification for the inclusion of these few patients. It is 
accepted that these few subjects are unlikely to have had a significant effect on the overall results of the 
studies.The enrolled population is representative of the anticipated UC treatment population for tofacitinib in 
the proposed indication. 
Patients were stratified depending on their previous treatment and efficacy sub-analysis for each sub-
population was evaluated separately.

Sample size 
The sample size, planned to be enrolled into the study and randomized in a 4:1 ratio to either tofacitinib 10 
mg BID or placebo, was estimated based on the primary endpoint of remission at Week 8 and the key 
secondary endpoint of mucosal healing at Week 8. This sample size was proposed to give at least 90% power 
to detect a treatment difference assuming a difference of 17.5% between treatment groups in the proportion 
of subjects in remission at Week 8 using Chi-square test at the significant level of 5% (2-sided) under the 
assumption of a placebo rate of 15%. The sample size also provided at least 90% power to detect a 
treatment difference assuming a difference of 17.5% between treatment groups in the proportion of subjects 
achieving mucosal healing at Week 8 using Chi-square test at the significant level of 5% under the 
assumption of a placebo rate of 35%. 
Randomisation 
Subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria at the baseline visit were randomly assigned to receive 
either tofacitinib 10 mg BID or matching placebo BID at a 4:1 allocation ratio. This reflected a change 
resulting from a protocol amendment which discontinued further enrolment into the tofacitinib 15 mg group. 
Subjects were stratified based on the status of prior treatment with TNFi therapy, corticosteroid use at 
baseline, and geographic region. 
Subjects enrolled prior to Protocol Amendment 3 were randomized into 1 of the 3 treatment groups of 
tofacitinib 10 mg or 15 mg BID, or placebo BID with an allocation ratio of 2:2:1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 35/161 
  
  
The subject was randomized to trial medication via the tele-randomization system, according to a computer 
generated pseudo random code using the method of permutated blocks balanced within each randomization 
strata. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was subject-, investigator-, and sponsor-blinded.  Blinding was achieved by the use of placebo 
tablets matching tofacitinib 5mg tablets. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The primary analysis population for efficacy endpoints was the FAS, defined as all subjects randomly assigned 
to either tofacitinib 10 mg BID or placebo. Additional analyses were performed for the PPAS, defined as a 
subset of subjects from the FAS population who had no major protocol violations that could have potentially 
had a significant impact on efficacy analyses, as determined by the sponsor prior to database lock. The safety 
analysis set included all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. 
Multiple Testing Procedure 
The family-wise Type I error rate was controlled at the level of 0.05 across the primary endpoint remission at 
Week 8, and the key secondary endpoint mucosal healing status at week 8, using a fixed sequence testing 
procedure: the superiority of tofacitinib 10 mg BID over placebo for the primary endpoint at Week 8 was 
tested first, and if the test p-value was less than 0.05, then the superiority of tofacitinib 10 mg BID over 
placebo for the key secondary endpoint was tested. Statistical significance could be claimed for the key 
secondary endpoint only if the treatment effect for the primary efficacy endpoint was also significant. All 
other efficacy endpoints were evaluated at the 0.05 level of significance, without adjustments for multiple 
comparisons. 
Analysis of Binary Efficacy Endpoints 
For all binary endpoints including the primary efficacy endpoint remission at Week 8 and the key secondary 
efficacy endpoint mucosal healing at Week 8, the Cochran-Mantel Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test stratified 
by prior TNFi exposure, corticosteroid use at baseline and geographic region was pre-specified for the 
comparisons of tofacitinib 10 mg BID versus the placebo group. The number of subjects and the proportion of 
responders are presented for each treatment group. The difference between treatment groups is presented 
along with the 95% CI using the normal approximation for the difference in binomial proportions. Subjects 
with missing data were treated as non-responders (referred to as the non-responder imputation [NRI] 
method). 
Analysis of Continuous Efficacy Endpoints 
For continuous endpoints that were measured repeatedly over time, such as partial Mayo score, the change 
from baseline was analysed using a linear mixed-effects model with baseline, treatment group, prior TNFi 
exposure, corticosteroid use at baseline, geographic region, visit, and treatment group-by-visit interaction as 
fixed effects, and subject as a random effect. The adjusted estimates of the differences and associated 95% 
CIs for the comparison of tofacitinib 10 mg BID to placebo were computed at each visit. For continuous 
endpoints that were only measured at baseline and Week 8, such as Mayo score, the change from baseline at 
Assessment report

Week 8 was analysed using an ANCOVA model with treatment group, prior TNFi exposure, corticosteroid use 
at baseline, and geographic region as factors, and baseline as a covariate.  No imputation was performed for 
missing data and analyses were performed on observed-case databased. Estimates of the differences and 
associated 95% CIs for the comparison of tofacitinib 10 mg BID to placebo were computed.  
Subgroup Analyses in the Individual Studies 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary efficacy 
endpoint. Results are presented for the subgroups defined by prior TNFi status, corticosteroid use at baseline, 
and geographic region. Prior failure or intolerance to TNFi agents, as assessed by the investigator, included 
the following reasons: (1) adverse event (AE), (2) lack of efficacy with failure to achieve a response, (3) lack 
of efficacy with failure to maintain a response, (4) lack of efficacy with failure to achieve a response and AE, 
and (5) lack of efficacy with failure to maintain a response and AE. TNFi failure was further analysed by 
primary non-response, defined as categories 2 or 4, and secondary non-response, defined as categories 3 or 
5. 
Pooled Analyses 
The data from the 2 pivotal induction studies, A3921094 and A3921095, were pooled to obtain the estimates 
of the treatment effects in the pooled FAS population. The purpose of the pooled analyses was to provide 
more precise estimates of the treatment effects overall and within subgroups. The same analysis methods as 
described above for the individual studies were used for the pooled analyses of binary and continuous 
endpoints except that study was also included as a stratum or factor. Analyses were also performed for 
various subgroups based on the pooled data, including demography, geographic region, baseline clinical 
characteristics, prior UC treatments, and corticosteroid use at baseline. 
Results induction study A3921094 
Participant flow 
A total of 614 subjects were randomized to study treatment. Of these, 598 subjects were randomized to 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID (476) or placebo (122), and comprised the FAS. All randomized subjects received at 
least 1 dose of study drug.  
There were 16 subjects who were randomized to and received tofacitinib 15 mg BID prior to Protocol 
Amendment 3; subjects who were assigned to the tofacitinib 15 mg BID dose group were not included in the 
analysis sets.

Conduct of the study 
There were a number of amendments and the most significant was Protocol Amendment 3 (Dated 30 
November 2012); this amendment removed the tofacitinib 15 mg BID arm from the study.  
The most frequent cause for a protocol deviation was that the subject did not have screening endoscopy 
performed within the protocol specified window (11.9%), which occurred in 12.8% of the tofacitinib 10 mg 
BID group, and in 8.2% of placebo group.  
Baseline data 
Overall, demographic characteristics were similar between treatment groups. For all subjects included in the 
FAS, there were more male (354/598, 59.2%) than female subjects (244/598, 40.8%), and the majority 
were white (82.4%). For the subjects who indicated their race as Asian (11.4%), Other (3.0%) or Unspecified 
(2.2%), the most frequent racial designation was Japanese (10.4%). Overall, the mean age of subjects was 
41.6 years (range: 18 to 81 years); the mean weight of subjects was 72.8 kg (range: 37.0 to 156.5 kg), and 
the mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.6 kg/m2 (range: 15.6 to 48.1 kg/m2 
Overall, enrolment within geographical areas was similar across treatment groups. The majority of subjects 
were enrolled at sites in Europe (59.7%) and North America (22.1%).

Overall, the median duration of disease was 6.3 years (range: 0.3 to 42.5). The median time since start of 
the most recent UC flare was 3.1 months (range: 0.0 to 154.4). 
For all subjects, the mean total Mayo score at baseline was 9.0 (SD: 1.4), with similar scores observed 
across treatment groups. The overall mean partial Mayo score at baseline was 6.4 (SD: 1.2), with similar 
scores across treatment groups. The extent of disease at baseline was similar across treatment groups. 
Overall, 53.3% of subjects had extensive colitis or pancolitis, including 53.1% in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID 
group and 54.1% in the placebo group. Extra-intestinal manifestations at baseline were reported in 23.7% of 
subjects overall.

treatment from Study A3921094 or Study A3921095. These subjects had achieved a clinical response in 
Study A3921094 or Study A3921095. 
Subjects were ineligible to participate in this study if any of the following criteria were met: 
1. Subjects who had a major protocol violation (as determined by the sponsor) in Study A3921094 or Study 
A3921095. 
2. Presence of indeterminate colitis, microscopic colitis, ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, or clinical findings 
suggestive of Crohn’s disease. 
3. Subjects who had surgery for UC or who, in the opinion of the investigator, were likely to require surgery 
for UC during the study period. 
4. Subjects who were expected to receive any prohibited concomitant medications, including medications that 
were either moderate to potent cytochrome P450, Family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) inducers or inhibitors, 
during the study period 
5. Subjects who were expected to receive live or attenuated virus vaccination during the study period and for 
6 weeks after the last dose of study drug. 
6. Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the study period. 
7. Baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrated clinically relevant abnormalities which may 
have affected subject safety or interpretation of study results 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018

8. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator or Pfizer, were uncooperative or unable to comply with 
study procedures. 
9. Subjects who were investigational site staff members or relatives of those site staff members or subjects 
who were Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the study. 
10. Any other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may 
have increased the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may 
have interfered with the interpretation of study results and in the judgment of the investigator, would have 
made the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.  
11. Subjects who were participating in or interested in participating in other investigational studies during 
Study A3921096. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments: tofacitinib 10 mg twice a day (BID), 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID, or the matching placebo BID, with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. for up to 53 weeks, the 
study drug was taken orally BID (approximately every 12 hours).  
Subjects were dispensed 2 bottles; either both containing 5 mg tofacitinib tablets; one containing 5mg 
tablets and one containing placebo; or both containing matching placebo tablets. Subjects took one tablet 
from each bottle for each treatment administration. 
Subjects were required to remain on stable doses of their concomitant medications for UC during the study 
treatment period, with the exception of corticosteroids. For subjects taking corticosteroids at the baseline 
visit of this study, tapering of the corticosteroids was to commence from Week 0.  
Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of tofacitinib as maintenance therapy in subjects with 
UC. 
Secondary Objectives 
Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tofacitinib as maintenance therapy in 
subjects with UC; to evaluate the efficacy of tofacitinib maintenance therapy in achieving mucosal healing in 
subjects with UC; to evaluate the tofacitinib pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure during maintenance therapy in 
subjects with UC; and to evaluate the effect of tofacitinib as maintenance therapy on quality-of-life in 
subjects with UC.

Sample size 
Sample size estimations were based on the assumptions regarding clinical response and remission rates in 
subjects receiving tofacitinib or placebo induction treatment in Study A3921094 and Study A3921095. These 
assumptions led to an estimate of 654 subjects eligible and 315 subjects in remission at baseline of Study 
A3921096. This sample size would have provided at least 90% power to detect a treatment difference 
between tofacitinib and placebo in the primary endpoint and the first key secondary endpoint and 
approximately 72% power to detect a treatment difference in the second key secondary endpoint assuming a 
difference of 17.5% between a tofacitinib dose and placebo using the Chi-square test at the significant level 
of 5%. Placebo rates were assumed to be 30% (primary endpoint), 50% (first key secondary endpoint), and 
40% (second key secondary endpoint).  
Once induction studies (A3921094 and A3921095) were completed, power calculations based on actual 
sample size were possible. There were approximately 594 subjects (198 per group) actually randomized to 
Study A3921096, including approximately 180 subjects (60 per group) in remission at baseline of Study 
A3921096. Based on the actual sample size and the same initial assumptions on placebo rates, there was at 
least 90% power to detect a treatment difference in the primary or first key secondary endpoint at the 
significant level of 5% or 2.5%. There was also an approximately 49% power to detect a treatment difference 
for the second key secondary endpoint. With the same assumptions but at the significance level of 2.5%, the 
estimated power was 38%. 
In addition, the original placebo assumptions were based on limited historical data. However emerging data 
from other UC studies over the years and the assumption of lower rates with central reading compared local 
reading for endoscopic scoring resulted in revised assumptions for the placebo rates. The assumptions for the 
placebo rates were updated to 10% to 15% for remission at Week 52, 15% to 20% for mucosal healing at 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 69/161 
  
  
Week 52, 15% to 20% for sustained steroid-free remission among subjects in remission at baseline of the 
maintenance study. 
Taking into account actual sample size from the induction studies and the revised assumptions for placebo 
rates, the actual sample size provided more than 90% power to detect a treatment difference between 
tofacitinib and placebo in the primary endpoint and the first key secondary endpoint. There was 
approximately 57% to 63% power to detect a treatment difference in the second key secondary endpoint. 
With the same assumptions but at the significance level of 2.5%, the estimated power was 46% to 51%. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were prospectively stratified according to their prior treatment assignments in Study A3921094 and 
Study A3921095 and whether they were in remission, and then randomized according to a computer 
generated pseudo random code using the method of permutated blocks balanced within each randomization 
strata. Subjects were randomized into 1 of the 3 treatment groups: tofacitinib 10 mg BID, tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID, or placebo BID with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was subject, investigator and sponsor-blinded. Blinding was achieved by the use of placebo tablets 
matching tofacitinib 5mg tablets.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The primary analysis population for efficacy endpoints was the FAS, defined as all subjects randomised. 
The modified full analysis set (mFAS) is a subset of the FAS including only subjects who received tofacitinib in 
the induction studies. 
The PPAS, defined as a subset of subjects from the FAS population who had no major protocol violations. as 
determined by the sponsor prior to the study being unblinded.  
The safety analysis set included all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. 
A sequentially rejective Bonferroni-based iterative multiple test procedure was prespecified to control the 
family-wise Type I error rate for the 6 comparisons of tofacitinib 10 mg BID or tofacitinib 5 mg BID versus 
placebo for the primary endpoint of remission and the 2 key secondary endpoints of mucosal healing and 
sustained corticosteroid-free remission among subjects in remission at baseline. 
The primary endpoint of remission at Week 52 was analysed in the FAS population using a stratified Cochran-
Mantel Haenszel (CMH) Chi-square test. The primary analysis was stratified by treatment received in the 
induction study and status of remission (remission or not) at Study A3921096 baseline.  
Non-responder imputation (NRI) was used to handle missing values. The difference in the proportion of 
responders and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were presented for active versus placebo groups 
using the normal approximation for the difference in binomial proportions.

The continuous secondary efficacy endpoints of Mayo score (measured at baseline, Week 24, and Week 52) 
and partial Mayo score (measured repeatedly over time) were analysed using a longitudinal linear mixed-
effects model assuming the mechanism of the missing data were missing at random. The 4 Mayo sub-scores 
were treated as ordered-categorical data. Missing data were not imputed, and descriptive statistics were 
based upon the observed-case data. 
Missing values for the PRO endpoints of WPAI, PRTI, PGIC, and UC-HCRU were not imputed. Analyses of 
these endpoints were based on the observed-case data. For the PRO endpoints of IBDQ, EQ 5D/VAS, and SF-
36, rules suggested by the developers of the questionnaires were followed in calculating the endpoints with 
any missing items. If these rules were not sufficient to impute the missing values, then the missing values 
were handled as following 
-For IBDQ binary endpoints, missing data were treated as non-responder data. 
-For IBDQ, EQ-5D/VAS, and SF-36 continuous endpoints, analyses were performed using a linear mixed-
effects model with repeated measures, where the missing values were assumed to be missing at random. 
Serum hsCRP concentrations were summarized as continuous data. For data analysis, assayed values below 
the limit of quantification (BLQ) were set to 10% less than the given assay lower limit for the specific 
biomarker. In listings, BLQ values were reported as < lower limit of quantification (LLQ) and replaced with 
the LLQ value. Assay values were set to missing if a value was indicated to be not done (ND) or no sample 
(NS). Otherwise, missing data were not imputed. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Overall, 593 subjects were randomized to study treatment (FAS). This included 198 subjects randomized to 
the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group, 197 subjects to the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group, and 198 subjects 
randomized to the placebo group. Of the 593 randomized subjects, 592 subjects received at least 1 dose of 
study drug (safety analysis set).  
Subject 10611004 was randomized but withdrew consent without commencing study drug. Subject 10061001 
was randomized into Study A3921096 in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group in error (the subject did not achieve 
clinical response at Week 8 of the induction study) instead of being enrolled into the open-label extension 
Study A3921139. Based on incorrect information that the subject was not dosed after randomization, the 
subject was permitted to be removed (i.e., de-randomized) from Study A3921096 and enrolled in Study 
A3921139. It was later realized that the subject had taken 6 (out of 8) tablets of tofacitinib 5 mg in Study 
A3921096 before de-randomization. This subject had no AEs reported while taking the Study A3921096 
study drug. This subject was not included in any Study A3921096 analysis sets. Subject 10611004 was 
included in FAS, but Subject 10061001 was not included in FAS.

All randomized subjects in the mFAS received at least 1 dose of study drug and were analysed for efficacy. 
Of the 523 subjects in the mFAS, 272 (52.0%) discontinued, and 251 (48.0%) completed the study. Those 
who discontinued due to reasons related to study drug included 38.1% in the tofacitinib 5 mg group, 31.8% 
in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, and 70.7% in the placebo group; the greater percentage in the placebo group 
was due to more subjects with discontinuation due to insufficient clinical response (tofacitinib 5 mg BID: 
35.8%, tofacitinib 10 mg BID: 27.2%, and placebo: 69.5%).

Recruitment 
First Subject First Visit (FSFV): 20 July 2012 
Last Subject Last Visit (LSLV): 27 May 2016 
Study subjects were enrolled from 196 investigational sites in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and 
South America.  
Conduct of the study 
The most frequent cause for a key protocol deviation was that the subject was randomized according to the 
wrong stratification factor of baseline remission status (34.1%). In this study, subjects were stratified by 
induction study (A3921094 or A3921095) treatment assignment and baseline remission status. Baseline 
remission status was to be determined by the investigator based on the subject’s remission status at the 
Week 8 visit of the induction study. Reasons for this deviation included inaccurate assessment of subjects’ 
status based on protocol-specified clinical response and investigator blinding to Study A3921096 stratification 
factors. In combination, these reasons contributed to delay in implementing corrective actions. This deviation 
occurred in similar proportions of subjects across treatment groups (32.8%, 35.5%, and 33.8%, in the 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and placebo groups, respectively) thereby mitigating the impact 
upon the analyses.

Clinical characteristics for the FAS population were generally similar among the 3 treatment groups, similar 
proportions of subjects across the treatment groups were in remission at the baseline of Study A3921096. 
The mean Mayo score at baseline of Study A3921096 was 3.3 (SD: 1.8), with similar scores observed across 
treatment groups. The overall mean partial Mayo score at baseline was 1.8 (SD: 1.3), with similar scores 
across treatment groups.

Numbers analysed 
The list of subjects to be excluded from the PPAS was defined prior to database lock based on a clinical 
review of the protocol deviations log. The categories of protocol deviations resulting in exclusion from the 
PPAS were consistent with those described in the SAP. All decisions regarding excluding subjects from 
evaluable populations because of protocol violations were made prior to unblinding.  
36 (6.1%) subjects were excluded from the PPAS, including 15 (7.6%) from the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group, 
11 (5.6%) from the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group, and 10 (5.1%) from the placebo group. 
The most common reason for excluding subjects from the PPAS was: subject was discontinued from the 
study for an administrative reason. This occurred in 11 (73.3%) subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group; 7 
(63.9%) subjects in the, tofacitinib 10 mg BID group; and 6 (60.0%) subjects in the placebo group. 
Ten (10) subjects excluded from the PPAS were randomized although they did not demonstrate at least 
clinical response during the induction studies, including 5 (33.3%) subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group, 
2 (18.2%) subjects in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group, and 3 (30.0%) subjects in the placebo group.

Exclusions From the Per Protocol Population by Reason for Exclusion –  FAS 
Outcomes and estimation 
Study A3921096 showed statistically significantly greater treatment effects for both treatment groups 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID versus placebo for remission at Week 52 (primary endpoint), mucosal 
healing at Week 52, and sustained corticosteroid free remission among subjects in remission at baseline (key 
secondary endpoints). Tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID also demonstrated statistically significantly higher 
proportions of subjects with clinical remission and clinical response compared with placebo. The 6 hypotheses 
of no difference from placebo for the primary endpoint and the 2 key secondary endpoints in both dose 
groups are all rejected based on the pre-specified multiple testing procedure.

Summary of Study A3921096 Efficacy Results at Week 52 (FAS, NRI, Central Read):

There were statistically significantly more patients in remission at week 52 in both tofacitinib groups 
compared to placebo. 
The benefit was also seen when looking only at patients in remission at baseline, which is important for a 
maintenance of remission indications.  
Benefit was also seen for those not in remission at baseline, showing that continued treatment of responders 
with tofacitinib can eventually lead to remission.  
Proportion of subjects in sustained corticosteroid-free remission among subjects in remission at 
baseline (key secondary endpoint and guideline recommended primary endpoint) 
This is the primary endpoint recommended in the draft CHMP guideline when assessing a claim for 
maintenance of remission. The results in table 27 show that for patients who achieved remission in the 
induction trials, they are more likely to maintain that remission for 12 months without the use of steroids if 
treated with tofacitinib (either 5mg or 10mg) (p<0.0001).

There were statistically significantly more patients with mucosal healing at week 52 in both tofacitinib groups 
compared to placebo. 
The benefit was also seen when looking only at patients in remission at baseline, which is important for a 
maintenance of remission indications.  
Ancillary analyses 
The efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID as maintenance therapy was supported by all other 
secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints, various analysis populations, sensitivity analyses, and locally-
read endoscopic findings. For all efficacy endpoints, the efficacy results based on the mFAS, which excluded 
subjects who received placebo in the induction studies, were consistent with the results based on the FAS. 
For remission, greater observed treatment effects were demonstrated for both tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 
mg BID versus placebo at Week 52 in subjects with baseline remission than without baseline remission, with 
lower baseline Mayo or partial Mayo score than with higher baseline Mayo or partial Mayo score, with lower 
baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) than with higher baseline CRP, without baseline corticosteroid use than with 
baseline corticosteroid use, and without prior TNFi use or failure than with prior TNFi use or failure. 
At Week 4, which was the first post-baseline timepoint assessed, partial Mayo score worsened in the placebo 
group when compared with both tofacitinib treatment groups. 
Time to treatment failure was statistically significantly different in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID 
treatment groups compared with placebo, with earlier and more frequent events in the placebo group. 
Study A3921096 demonstrated maintenance of statistically significant improvements in the IBDQ, SF-36, and 
WPAI scores for both treatment groups versus placebo from the first measured timepoint through Week 52. 
The proportion of subjects who had treatment failure was lower in both tofacitinib groups compared to the 
proportion of subjects in the placebo group at each timepoint starting from Week 8, the first time point where 
treatment failure was assessed, through the entire 52-week study

Subgroup analyses by prior TNFi status demonstrated that a treatment effect was observed in those with 
prior TNFi failure and even in the most refractory TNFi subgroup, i.e., those with primary non-response to 
TNFi. The magnitude of observed treatment effects was similar for subjects treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
and tofacitinib 10 mg BID in the subgroups of subjects without prior TNFi exposure or failure. In contrast, 
there was a clinically meaningful observed treatment difference between tofacitinib 10 mg BID and 5 mg BID 
in the subgroup of subjects with prior TNFi failure, with differences between the 2 tofacitinib groups ranging 
from 9.7 to 16.7 percentage points across the primary and key secondary endpoints.

Analysis of time to treatment failure (FAS) as an estimated rate (number of treatment failure events/number 
of subjects at risk)  was performed.  By Week 8, there was a statistically significant difference in the rates of 
treatment failure between the placebo group and both of the tofacitinib treatment groups. At Week 8, the 
placebo group had a higher estimated treatment failure rate (23.6%) compared with the tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
and 10 mg BID groups (7.0% and 5.2%, respectively). At Week 52, the rates were 73.0%, 41.9%, and

Patient Related Outcomes 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire: 
Mean observed IBDQ total scores in Study A3921096 were similar among the 3 treatment groups at baseline 
of the study. At the last visit, mean IBDQ total score was 167.8 for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group, 171.6 for 
the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group, and 133.2 for the placebo group. 
Both the tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID groups showed statistically significantly greater improvements 
than placebo in IBDQ total score at all timepoints analysed (Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 52) of Study 
A3921096 (Table 61). A similar result was seen for the 4 domain scores at the timepoints. 
Statistically significantly more subjects in both the tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID groups had IBDQ 
scores ≥ 170 (IBDQ remission) compared with the placebo group at all timepoints analysed (Weeks 8, 16, 
24, 32, 40, and 52). A similar result was seen for IBDQ response (≥16 point increase in IBDQ total score 
from induction baseline) at the timepoints analysed.

Statistically significant improvement was demonstrated at Weeks 24 and 52 for both the tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
and 10 mg BID groups relative to the placebo group for the SF-36 components in Study A3921096. A similar 
result was seen for all SF-36 domains at Weeks 24 and 52. 
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment – Ulcerative Colitis: 
There was a statistically significant difference between each of the tofacitinib treatment groups and placebo 
at Week 52 in presenteeism and non-work activity impairment. The tofacitinib treatment groups also showed 
greater effect on absenteeism and work productivity loss; however, the differences versus placebo were not 
statistically significant. 
Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimensions/Visual Analog Scale: 
EQ-5D Utility Index observed mean scores in Study A3921096 were similar between the treatment groups at 
baseline of each study: 0.87 for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 0.86 for tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and 0.85 for placebo. 
Similarly, EQ-5D VAS observed mean scores at baseline were 76.19 for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 76.19 for 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and 77.23 for placebo. 
There was a statistically significant difference between each of the tofacitinib treatment groups and placebo 
in Utility Index score and VAS score at Weeks 24 and 52. Similar results were observed at other timepoints 
(Weeks 8, 16, 32, and 40).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The data from the 2 pivotal induction studies, A3921094 and A3921095, were pooled to obtain the estimates 
of the treatment effects in the pooled FAS population. The pooled FAS population, which includes the FAS 
from each study, consists of 1139 subjects (598 subjects in Study A3921094 and 541 subjects in Study 
A3921095). Subjects randomized to tofacitinib 15 mg BID prior to the Protocol Amendment 3 for Study 
A3921094 and Protocol Amendment 2 for Study A3921095 are not included in the FAS (16 subjects in Study 
A3921094 and 6 subjects in Study A3921095). In both Studies A3921094 and A3921095, the proportion of 
subjects who were in remission at Week 8 was significantly greater in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group 
compared with the placebo group (p=0.0070 and p=0.0005, respectively) and the treatment effect was 
similar between studies.

Supportive study 
Open-Label, Long-Term Extension Study A3921139 
Study Design 
Study A3921139 was a Phase 3, multicentre, open-label study in subjects who had completed or 
demonstrated treatment failure in the maintenance study (A3921096), or who were non-responders after 
completing 8 weeks of treatment in the induction studies (A3921094 or A3921095). Subjects in remission at 
baseline of Study A3921139 were initially assigned to tofacitinib 5 mg BID; all other subjects were initially 
assigned to tofacitinib 10 mg BID. 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of long-term tofacitinib therapy 
in subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC). The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of 
long-term tofacitinib therapy in subjects with UC and to evaluate the effect of long-term tofacitinib therapy 
on quality of life in subjects with UC. 
Subjects from the induction Studies A3921094 and A3921095 (i.e., non-responders) who failed to 
demonstrate clinical response at Month 2 of Study A3921139 were to be withdrawn from the study. 
This study is currently ongoing and thus an interim report has been presented.  
Disposition of Subjects 
Among subjects eligible for the study (those who completed or demonstrated treatment failure in 
maintenance Study A3921096 or who were non responders after completing induction Studies A3921094 or 
A3921095), a total of 944 subjects were enrolled and assigned to study treatment as of 08 July 2016. Of 
those, 914 subjects were enrolled for at least 2 months prior to 08 July 2016. 156 subjects were assigned to 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 102/161 
  
  
 
 
the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and 758 subjects were assigned to the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group at the 
beginning of Study A3921139. All 914 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in 
the FAS. As of 08 July 2016, the median duration of treatment was 338 days for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
group and 369 days for the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group. 
Of the 914 subjects in the FAS, 381 subjects (41.7%) discontinued and 533 subjects (58.3%) were ongoing 
as of 08 July 2016. Of the subjects who received tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 17/156 (10.9%) discontinued from the 
study, and 364/758 (48.0%) of subjects who received tofacitinib 10 mg BID discontinued. 
Efficacy Results 
Analyses were conducted on data through Month 24, however a relatively small number of subjects had 
reached Month 24 of Study A3921139 as of 08 July 2016; therefore, it is difficult to draw conclusions from 
the Month 24 data. 
In subjects who received tofacitinib 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID and were in remission at the end of the 52-week 
maintenance Study A3921096 (i.e., the maintenance remission subpopulation of the FAS), treatment with 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID in the open-label Study A3921139 showed persistence of tofacitinib efficacy, with 
approximately 75% of subjects maintaining remission at Month 12 (NRI analysis). 
In the subpopulation of subjects with treatment failure on tofacitinib 5 mg BID or placebo in maintenance 
Study A3921096 and who received tofacitinib 10 mg BID in induction Study A3921094 or A3921095 (i.e., the 
maintenance treatment failures subpopulation of the FAS), dose escalation or retreatment with tofacitinib 10 
mg BID in Study A3921139 recaptured tofacitinib efficacy. After 2 months of treatment with tofacitinib 10 mg 
BID in Study A3921139, 34.5% and 40.4% of subjects who received either tofacitinib 5 mg BID or placebo in 
the maintenance study, respectively, achieved remission. At Month 12, 52.1% and 43.4% of subjects, who 
received either tofacitinib 5 mg BID or placebo in the maintenance study, respectively, achieved remission 
(NRI analysis). 
In subjects failing to achieve a clinical response after 8 weeks of blinded tofacitinib 10 mg BID in induction 
Studies A3921094 and A3921095 (i.e., the induction non-responders subpopulation of the FAS), continued 
treatment with tofacitinib 10 mg BID for an additional 2 months in Study A3921139 resulted in clinical 
response in 60.1% (observed case analysis) and 52.9% (NRI analysis) of these subjects. 
Persistence of remission with tofacitinib long-term treatment was shown in the open-label LTE study, 
A3921139. Among the 144 subjects in the subpopulation of Maintenance Remitters that entered Study 
A3921139 (i.e., those subjects who took either tofacitinib 5 mg or 10 mg BID in Study A3921096 and 
completed the study having achieved remission and received tofacitinib 5 mg BID in Study A3921139), only 
15 subjects (10.4%) discontinued from Study A3921139 study as 08 July 2016.   
The potential of retreatment with tofacitinib 10 mg BID to regain treatment efficacy after treatment 
withdrawal was examined in the cohort of subjects who received tofacitinib 10 mg BID during induction and 
who then experienced treatment failure while receiving placebo during the maintenance study, A3921096. 
After 2 months of retreatment with tofacitinib 10 mg BID, of the subjects remaining in the study at that 
timepoint, 40/88 (44.5%) had achieved remission and 56/91 (61.5%) had achieved mucosal healing. The 
corresponding observed proportions of subjects remaining in the study achieving remission and mucosal 
healing at Month 12 were 36/60 (60.0%) and 45/61 (73.8%), respectively.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application for tofacitinib is to include an additional therapeutic indication for the treatment of adult 
patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response, lost 
response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent.  
The Applicant has conducted 3 pivotal Phase 3 studies (2 identical 8-week induction studies [A3921094 and 
A3921095] and one 52-week maintenance study [A3921096]), and an ongoing Phase 3 open-label LTE study 
(A3921139). The phase 3 trials studied both the induction treatment of active disease and maintenance 
treatment; which are in line with the proposed indication and the CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Guideline on the 
development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis. All three studies A3921094, 
A3921095 and A3921096 were multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety 
studies. 
The study designs of a randomised double blind parallel group placebo comparison were acceptable in the 
two inductions and one maintenance studies.  Whilst in the SAWP advice the initial advice was to conduct a 
three-arm active comparator study; the feasibility of this approach was discussed and this was not explicitly 
requested.  Placebo was considered an acceptable comparator in the clinical studies due to the proposed 
indication. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were generally acceptable.  
Subjects were selected based on a diagnosis of UC >4 months prior to entry into the study, with a 
histological conformation. Moderately to severely active disease was defined by a total Mayo score of >6, 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 104/161 
  
  
 
 
with a rectal bleeding score of >1, and an endoscopic subscore of >2 on the Mayo score determined within 
10 days of baseline visit. Appropriate measures of diagnosis and disease severity were utilised for subject 
selection.  
Subjects had failed or been intolerant of at least 1 of the following: oral or intravenous (IV) corticosteroids; 
Azathioprine, 6-MP; or TNFi therapy: infliximab or adalimumab. The applicant has provided sufficient data to 
confirm that subjects received optimum therapy in accordance with guidelines prior to being randomised into 
the tofacitinib trial programme.  
At entry into the induction studies, subjects were permitted to continue oral corticosteroids or 5-ASA for UC. 
The continuation of background therapy was acceptable, considering the proposed indication, and is 
consistent with CHMP guidance CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Guideline on the development of new medicinal 
products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis. Chronic treatment for UC with antibiotics was permitted; 
however it would be expected that antibiotic use would be excluded. The applicant noted that some treating 
clinicians may use antibiotics in select UC patients who have failed to otherwise attain acceptable clinical 
response to their current treatment regimen in the hope of having an effect on the patient’s microbiome and 
attaining potential additional clinical benefit, even if there are no controlled studies supporting this treatment 
regimen. It was clarified that the number of patients who received concomitant antibiotics for UC treatment 
was 6/905 (0.7%) of the patients receiving tofacitinib 10mg BID in the induction studies, and it is accepted 
that these few subjects are unlikely to have had a significant effect on the overall results of the studies.  
Patients were stratified depending on their previous treatment and efficacy sub-analysis for each sub-
population was evaluated separately. This was useful as the studied population was heterogeneous. 
Symptomatic relief was evaluated with patient related outcomes, and the MAH has provided a discussion 
summarising key evidence for the reliability and validity of the SF-36v2, IBDQ and WPAI instruments for UC 
populations. These PRO measures are widely used and are acceptable for use in this setting. 
Disease activity was measured by the Mayo Scoring System to evaluate efficacy in the tofacitinib UC clinical 
development program. Endoscopic appearance was read by both study site investigator (locally read) and by 
a central reader through video recorded during the procedure.  Centrally read endoscopic subscores were 
used for both eligibility and primary efficacy analyses which allowed for adjudication of endoscopic activity.  
The applicant refers throughout the clinical study reports for all the studies to Total Mayo score however in 
the Clinical Efficacy summary there is reference to the point that the Mayo score was adapted to remove the 
physician’s global assessment (PGA) upon scientific advice from the FDA. It was confirmed that the total 
Mayo score was used in the clinical studies, and that additional sensitivity analyses using modified Mayo 
score, excluding PGA, were also performed.  
For the induction studies A3921094 and A3921095 the primary efficacy endpoint in the induction studies was 
remission which was defined by a total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 
1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Ideally the co-primary endpoints on both symptomatic relief and 
endoscopic healing would have been utilised in line with the CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Guideline on the 
development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis. The total Mayo score including 
the PGA is not of primary interest. It is however noted that the chosen definition of remission did refer to all 
sub scores of the Mayo score and as such did encompass both symptomatic and endoscopic evaluation and in 
addition included cessation of rectal bleeding in the definition and as such is acceptable.  
The maintenance Study A3921096 was a separate follow up study from the induction studies. The primary 
analysis population in the maintenance study includes all responders to induction treatments, i.e. both active 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 105/161 
  
  
and placebo; which was endorsed by the SAWP. Subjects who completed either of the induction studies and 
achieved clinical response or remission irrespective of treatment were re-randomized into the maintenance 
study. It is noted that both responders and remitters were included in the trial. The inclusion of responders in 
a maintenance study is useful as it is relevant to study if continued treatment in responders may eventually 
lead to remission. To evaluate a claim of “maintenance of remission” the primary interest is in patients who 
were in remission at baseline. This can be achieved by looking at subgroups analyses for those in remission 
at baseline. The recommended primary endpoint in the draft CHMP guideline CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1 
Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis is steroid free 
remission maintained without surgery throughout at least 12 months. One of the key secondary endpoints is 
sustained corticosteroid-free remission at both Weeks 24 and 52 among subjects in remission at baseline.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Phase 3 Induction Study Treatment: A3921094 and A3921095: 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the induction studies was remission, defined by a total Mayo score of 2 
points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and rectal bleeding subscore of 0. 
Subjects were randomized to either tofacitinib 10 mg BID or placebo BID, with a treatment allocation ratio of 
4:1. Subjects were stratified by previous treatment with TNFi therapy, oral corticosteroid use at baseline, and 
geographic region. Active treatment in the study continued for 8 weeks which was an acceptable length of 
time.  
The chosen study populations were reflective and appropriate to the proposed indication. The study 
populations were well characterised in terms of disease extent, duration, disease activity, prior treatment, 
smoking status, clinical characteristics and prior treatment.  Previous treatment with TNFi agents, 
corticosteroids was similar between treatment group. Prior failure to corticosteroid or TNFi treatment for UC 
was similar across treatment groups. 
Statistically significantly higher proportions of subjects in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group achieved the 
primary endpoint of remission as well as the key secondary endpoint of mucosal healing at Week 8 compared 
with placebo in the induction studies. The tofacitinib 10 mg BID group also had statistically significantly 
higher proportions of subjects with the secondary endpoints of clinical remission, clinical response, and 
endoscopic remission at Week 8 as compared with placebo. In addition, in the exploratory end points of 
Patient Related Outcome which were assessed with IBDQ (total and all individual domains) and SF-36 (all 
component and domain scores) tofacitinib 10 mg BID had significantly greater improvement. 
Symptomatic improvements were observed at an early stage. Tofacitinib 10 mg BID showed significantly 
greater improvement from baseline of partial Mayo score compared with placebo by Week 2. 
The results of the 2 replicate induction studies show consistent and statistically significant findings with 
similar magnitudes of placebo-adjusted treatment effect for tofacitinib 10 mg BID across endpoints.  
Across endpoints, treatment effect was observed in the refractory TNFi subgroups, including subjects with 
prior TNFi exposure or failure, those subjects with prior failure to 2 or more TNFi agents, and those with 
primary non-response to TNFi. The magnitude of observed treatment effect for these endpoints was similar in 
the subgroups of subjects with prior TNFi exposure or failure as compared to those without prior TNFi 
exposure or failure.  
Phase 3 Maintenance Study Treatment A3921096: 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 106/161 
  
  
Subjects were randomized to either tofacitinib 10 mg BID, tofacitinib 5 mg BID or placebo BID with an 
allocation ratio of 1:1:1.  The study was conducted as a 52-week double-blind treatment period followed by a 
4 week safety follow-up for subjects who did not participate in the open-label study (A3921139).   
Subjects were stratified according to their prior treatment assignment in induction study (A3921094 or 
A3921095), and whether they achieved remission status at the end of the induction study. Subjects taking 
oral corticosteroids at baseline were required to taper off the corticosteroids per the protocol-specified 
tapering regimen starting the first week after entering the study.  
It was noted that there were higher rates of discontinuation due to insufficient clinical response, especially in 
the 5mg group, and this was considered of relevance in reference to the proposed posology of the product in 
the maintenance phase. Data were provided that show that for patients treated with tofacitinib, higher 
discontinuation rates due to inadequate clinical response (ICR) were seen in the 5mg BID cohort (35.4%) 
compared to the 10mg BID cohort (27.0%), and particularly driven by the 5mg BID subset of patients with 
prior TNFi failure (41.1%) rather than those without prior TNFi failure (30.6%). The MAH acknowledged that 
the discontinuation rate due to ICR is analogous to the clinical efficacy results, whereby the increment in 
efficacy between 5mg BID and 10mg BID regimens was larger in those with a history of TNFi failure, 
especially for the highly relevant endpoint of sustained corticosteroid-free remission amongst remitters. It is 
considered that the data on discontinuation of therapy are analogous to the efficacy data, and are supportive 
of the recommendation to consider maintenance dosing with 10 mg BID in the sub-population of prior TNFi 
failure. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was remission at Week 52, defined by a Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with 
no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and rectal bleeding subscore of 0. The key secondary endpoints 
were mucosal healing at Week 52, defined by a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1; and sustained 
corticosteroid-free remission at both Weeks 24 and 52 among subjects in remission at baseline defined by a 
Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore 
of 0, in addition to not requiring any treatment with corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks prior to the visit. 
CHMP Draft guidelines CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1 Guideline on the development of new medicinal 
products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis, advise that the primary endpoint should be the number of 
patients in clinical and endoscopic remission in whom steroids could be withdrawn. As such the relevance of 
the second key secondary efficacy endpoint was highlighted and is viewed as a primary endpoint in 
assessment.   
Statistically significantly greater treatment effects were demonstrated for both treatment groups versus 
placebo for the primary endpoint of remission at Week 52, and key secondary endpoints of mucosal healing 
at Week 52. This was seen in the FAS and in the subgroup of patients in remission at baseline. A statistically 
significant benefit was also seen for sustained corticosteroid free remission among subjects in remission at 
baseline. The observed treatment effect was higher in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group than the tofacitinib 5 
mg BID group for primary and key secondary endpoints. According to the draft CHMP guideline 
CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1 Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment of 
Ulcerative Colitis in order to obtain an indication for “treatment of active ulcerative colitis”, efficacy in both 
“induction of remission” as well as “maintenance of remission” should be demonstrated.  
Depending on the properties of the drug (i.e. not suitable for long term treatment or not suitable for acute 
treatment) separate indications for “induction of remission” or “maintenance of remission” may be granted. 
The applicant initially claimed separate indications on induction and maintenance of remission however 
agreed on CHMP request to update the wording to treatment of  adult patients with moderately to severely

active ulcerative colitis (UC) to fulfil the draft EMA UC guideline as well as to be consistent with the wording 
of others biologic therapies. 
Time to treatment failure was statistically significantly different in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID 
treatment groups compared with placebo, with earlier and more frequent events in the placebo group.  
With regards to patient related outcomes, there were statistically significant improvements in the IBDQ, SF-
36, and WPAI scores for both treatment groups versus placebo from the first measured timepoint through 
Week 52. 
Across the primary and key secondary endpoints, treatment effect was observed in the TNFi subgroups, 
including subjects with prior TNFi exposure or failure and those with primary non-response to TNFi. The 
magnitude of observed treatment effects was similar for subjects treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID in the subgroups of subjects without prior TNFi exposure or failure. In contrast, there 
was a clinically meaningful observed treatment difference between tofacitinib 10 mg BID and 5 mg BID in the 
subgroup of subjects with prior TNFi failure, with differences between the 2 tofacitinib groups ranging from 
9.7 to 16.7 percentage points across the primary and key secondary endpoints. Data shows that for endpoint 
of sustained corticosteroid-free remission at both weeks 24 and 52 in study A3921096 among subjects in 
remission at baseline for tofacitinib 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID versus placebo in those with prior TNFi failure 
figures were 22.2%, 38.9% and 4.8% respectively. Compared to 40.4%, 51.4% and 4.3% in those who had 
not failed TNFi previously.  
Sub-group analyses for maintenance of remission were subsequently provided by the applicant for subjects 
by prior TNFi failure. These demonstrated that for the key endpoint of sustained corticosteroid free remission 
in those at remission at baseline, the efficacy of the 10 mg BID maintenance dosing schedule was greater 
than for the 5 mg BID dosing. While a trend toward superiority over placebo was reported for the 5 mg BID 
maintenance posology, the 95% CIs precluded a statistical claim of superiority. For the higher, 10 mg BID 
maintenance posology, superiority was clearly demonstrated over placebo, particularly in the sub-group of 
patients with only 1 prior TNFi failure and in secondary TNFi non-responders, although favourable trends 
were seen in other sub-populations. 
The Applicant has proposed that the recommended dose for induction of patients with moderate to severe UC 
is 10 mg BID for up to 16 weeks. Although this recommendation deviated from the CHMP Scientific Advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/1219/4/FU/1/2016/II), the applicant provided an efficacy and safety justification for this 
extended 10mg BID induction period for patients with an inadequate clinical response to an initial 8-week 
regimen, based upon the results of the open-label LTE study. This indicated an incremental efficacy response 
between 8 and 16 weeks that would not otherwise be achievable with a 12-week cut-off, and no significant 
additional safety risks were evident in the subsequent 8-weeks compared to the initial 8-weeks. 
The design of the UC program included conversion from active (tofacitinib) treatment to placebo in some 
subjects during re-randomization at the time of entry into the maintenance study. There were no reports of 
pharmacological effects of withdrawal or rebound in the UC program.  
The MAH provided a comprehensive evaluation regarding extra-intestinal manifestations in the UC 
programme, including efficacy analyses by prior history or baseline presence of EIMs and also an analysis of 
the effects of tofacitinib on changes from baseline in EIM activity. For the former, no clear difference was 
noted in the efficacy of tofacitinib between EIM subgroups. The clinical efficacy advantage of the 10mg BID 
dosing over the 5mg BID dosing in the maintenance study was more pronounced for the patients with prior 
or active EIMs. Data regarding the numbers of patients with change in status of EIMs during the induction 
and maintenance studies were limited, although it was noted that among subjects with peripheral arthritis at 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 108/161 
  
  
induction baseline, more patients in general improved on tofacitinib treatment than worsened. It is agreed 
that it is not possible to make general conclusions regarding the specific effects of tofacitinib on EIMs and 
there is no evidence to suggest any effects that may alter the outcome of efficacy and safety assessments. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal induction studies A3921094 and A3921095 were appropriately designed. For the primary endpoint 
of remission superiority has been demonstrated to placebo for tofacitinib 10 mg BID for 8 weeks; in induction 
treatment in subjects with moderately to severely active UC who failed or were intolerant to at least 1 
protocol specified UC treatment, either corticosteroids, AZA/6-MP, or TNFi therapy. Statistical significantly 
benefit was also demonstrated for the relevant secondary endpoints. An appropriate justification has been 
provided in support of an extended, 16-week total induction period for patients with inadequate clinical 
response during the initial 8-week induction phase.  
For the pivotal maintenance study A3921096, the primary endpoint presented was remission at 52 weeks. 
However, though sustained corticosteroid steroid free remission in those at remission at baseline was 
presented as a secondary endpoint, in line with the CHMP guidance this should be viewed as a primary 
analysis endpoint. The applicant initially claimed separate indications on induction and maintenance of 
remission however agreed on CHMP request to update the wording to treatment of  adult patients with 
moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) to fulfil the draft EMA UC guideline as well as to be 
consistent with the wording of others biologic therapies. 
The proportion of subjects in sustained corticosteroid-free remission among subjects in remission at baseline 
was statistically significantly greater in both the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and the tofacitinib 10 mg BID 
group compared with the placebo group. Tofacitinib 5 mg BID and Tofacitinib 10 mg BID were also superior 
to placebo for the primary endpoint of remission at Week 52, and other relevant secondary endpoints. The 
incremental benefit of 10 mg BID maintenance dosing over the 5 mg BID maintenance dosing is particularly 
pronounced in patients who have failed previous TNFi therapy, and it is acknowledged that the trial evidence 
supports the posology recommendation that the 10 mg BID maintenance schedule should be considered in 
this sub-group of TNFi-refractory patients.   
Overall the clinical efficacy of tofacitinib in the treatment of UC has been adequately demonstrated. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Tofacitinib is already approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the RA 
program it was identified that Tofacitinib causes neutropenia and lymphopenia, and is associated with a risk 
of serious infections (e.g. pneumonia) and opportunistic infections (OI) (e.g. herpes zoster (HZ)). The 
incidence rate for serious infection was 3.6 per 100 patient year (PY) during the RA programme compared to 
1.7 for placebo; there was a higher incidence in the elderly. Neoplasms represent an important potential risk 
due to the mechanism of action. Common ADRs include headache, URTI, nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, nausea, 
and hypertension.

Patient exposure 
The safety data of the UC program were analysed as 3 cohorts and an induction non-responder (IndNR) 
subgroup: 
Cohort 1 (Phase 2, Phase 3 [P2P3] Induction) consists of 1220 subjects in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 induction 
studies, and evaluates short-term safety of induction therapy with tofacitinib 10 mg BID versus placebo for 
up to 8 weeks. 
Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance) consists of 592 subjects in the Phase 3 maintenance study, and evaluates longer-
term safety of maintenance therapy with tofacitinib 5 mg BID and tofacitinib 10 mg BID versus placebo for 
up to 52 weeks. 
The IndNR subgroup consists of subjects who failed to show clinical response at the end of a Phase 3 
induction study and then entered the LTE Study A3921139 to be treated with open-label tofacitinib 10 mg 
BID. The entire IndNR subgroup, with data captured for up to 53 weeks into Study A3921139, are used to 
supplement the assessment of the safety profile of the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group in Cohort 2 (P3 
Maintenance).  
Cohort 3 (Phase 2, Phase 3, long-term extension [P2P3LTE] Tofacitinib) consists of all 1157 subjects who 
received tofacitinib 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID in the UC development program (including all induction, 
maintenance and LTE studies), and provides assessment of the entire safety experience with tofacitinib for up 
to 4.4 years. For Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib), primary analyses were performed for all subjects who 
received tofacitinib (the Tofacitinib All group), with supplemental analyses performed for the Predominant 
Dose (PD) groups and Post-induction Dose (PInd) groups. Most subjects were categorized to the PD 10 mg 
BID group (84%) in the PD dose groups, and to the PInd 10 mg BID group (78%) in the PInd dose groups. 
External independent adjudication committees were established for reviews of potential AEs of opportunistic 
infections (OIs), malignancies, cardiovascular (CV) events, hepatic events, and gastrointestinal (GI) 
perforations. 
Adverse events 
Cohort 1 (P2P3 Induction) 
In the induction studies, the proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, and severe AEs were similar between the 
placebo group and the tofacitinib group over the 9-week study treatment. The system organ classifications 
(SOCs) in which AEs occurred most frequently (all causality) among tofacitinib-treated subjects were 
Gastrointestinal disorders (17.7%) and Infections and infestations (21.1%; compared to 21.6% and 15.2%, 
respectively, for placebo.

The commonest AEs by preferred term (PT) among tofacitinib-treated subjects were Headache (7.8%) and 
Nasopharyngitis (6.0%) compared to 6.7% and 5.0%, respectively, in placebo. 
In the complete treatment population with tofacitinib, the most commonly reported infection was 
nasopharyngitis, occurring in 18.2% of patients (211 patients). In the entire treatment experience with 
Xeljanz, the overall incidence rate of infections was 60.3 events per 100 patient-years (involving 49.4% of 
patients; total 572 patients). 
Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance) 
In the maintenance study, the proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, and severe AEs were also similar 
among the placebo group and the tofacitinib groups regardless of the tofacitinib dose. In the tofacitinib All 
group in Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance), the SOCs in which AEs most frequently occurred (all causality) were 
Gastrointestinal disorders SOC and Infections and infestations SOC, and the most frequently reported PTs for 
AEs among tofacitinib-treated subjects were Colitis ulcerative and Nasopharyngitis. 
IndNR Subgroup 
The proportions of subjects with AEs, severe AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were generally similar 
between the entire IndNR subgroup (data captured for up to 53 weeks into LTE Study A3921139) and the 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID group in Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance). The proportion of subjects with SAEs was 
numerically higher in the IndNR subgroup than the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group in Cohort 2 (10.0% versus 
5.6%).

In the tofacitinib All group in Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance), the SOCs in which AEs most frequently occurred (all 
causality) were Gastrointestinal disorders SOC and Infections and infestations SOC, and the most frequently 
reported PTs for AEs among tofacitinib-treated subjects were Colitis ulcerative and Nasopharyngitis. 
IndNR Subgroup :The proportions of subjects with AEs, severe AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were 
generally similar between the entire IndNR subgroup (data captured for up to 53 weeks into LTE Study 
A3921139) and the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group in Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance). The proportion of subjects 
with SAEs was numerically higher in the IndNR subgroup than the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group in Cohort 2 
(10.0% versus 5.6%). 
Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (All Causality) Occurring in ≥2% of Subjects in any 
Treatment Group by System Organ Class SOC and Preferred Term PT in Cohort 3: 
AEs were reported in 82.1% of subjects, and the most frequently occurring AEs (all causalities) were in the 
Infections and infestations System Organ Class (SOC) (42.8% of subjects) and GI disorders SOC (38.0% of 
subjects), and the most frequently occurring preferred terms (PTs) for AEs were Colitis ulcerative (19.4% of 
subjects) and Nasopharyngitis 
AEs in Subjects Who Received Induction Treatment with Tofacitinib 15 mg BID 
71 subjects received tofacitinib 15 mg BID for induction therapy (49 in Study A3921063, 16 in Study 
A3921094, and 6 in Study A3921095). There were no deaths, no serious infections, no herpes zoster cases, 
and no malignancies (either NMSC or malignancies [excluding NMSC]). Two (2) of these 71 subjects reported 
SAEs (2 events related to worsening UC in 2 subjects) during induction treatment. In the Phase 3 induction 
Studies A3921094 and A3921095, none of the 22 subjects who received tofacitinib 15 mg BID had AEs 
confirmed to be OI, MACE or GI perforation by external adjudication committees. In the Phase 2 induction

There are no AEs with increased incidence for tofacitinib compared to placebo, which are not already 
considered an ADR of tofacitinib (common or very common), as listed in the current approved SmPC (RA 
indication).  
Dose dependency for the risk of Herpes Zoster (HZ) and opportunistic infections (OIs) (mainly HZ) and NMSC 
was observed in the overall population treated with tofacitinib in the UC program. There was a trend toward 
an increased risk of HZ and NMSC in the TNFi-failure subgroup compared with the non-TNFi-failure subgroup. 
The IR of opportunistic infections (OIs) and Herpes Zoster (HZ) in UC Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib i.e all 
subjects who had received at least 1 dose of tofacitinib in the UC program) was higher than in the RA or PsO 
programs. The MAH reports that subjects in the UC programme differ from subjects in the RA and PsO 
programmes in selected demographics and baseline characteristics (e.g. concomitant medicines), and such 
variations may affect the propensity to develop specific safety events, eg, NMSC in UC patients who received 
prior immunosuppressants , and PsO patients who received prior phototherapy. There may also be other 
differences among patients in the UC, RA, and PsO programs that affect the susceptibility of these patients to 
infections or other adverse events (AEs), eg, differences in systemic inflammatory burdens or comorbidities.  
Such differences among these heterogeneous patient populations may contribute to some degree of 
variability in IRs of AEs of special interest reported across indications.

The differences in IRs for HZ among indications could be attributable to differences in program design and/or 
patient characteristics. For example, the percentage of subjects in the UC program who received tofacitinib 
10 mg BID (rather than tofacitinib 5 mg BID) most of the time during tofacitinib treatment was higher in the 
UC program.  In addition, treatment with corticosteroids is a known risk factor for HZ. The mean dose of oral 
corticosteroids at baseline of UC Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance) was over twice as high as that at baseline of the 
RA randomized Phase 3 studies (14.7 versus 6.7 mg/day prednisone-equivalent among subjects who 
received baseline oral corticosteroids) (S0012 2.7.4 SCS Table 64).  These differences could have contributed 
to the numerically higher IR of HZ reported in the UC program compared with RA and PsO.

The IRs of HZ in UC Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance) demonstrated dose-dependency (placebo 0.97/100 PY, 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID 2.05/100 PY, tofacitinib 10 mg BID 6.64/100 PY), with statistically significant difference 
shown between placebo and tofacitinib 10 mg BID.  This assessment of dose-dependency in the risk of HZ in 
the UC program is consistent with the findings in the RA and PsO programs.  Given the dose-dependency of 
HZ, the risk of HZ with tofacitinib 10 mg BID may be higher than that associated with 5 mg BID. HZ is a 
recognized risk of tofacitinib treatment.   
Despite dose-dependent increase in the risk of HZ, the majority of HZ events in the UC program were limited 
to cutaneous involvement. In Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib), a total of 69 events of HZ occurred in 65 
subjects.  Among these events, 3 were severe AEs, and 4 were SAEs.  Herpes zoster resulted in subject 
discontinuation in 5 (7.7%) of the 65 subjects.  Post-herpetic neuralgia was reported by 3 (4.6%) subjects 
who developed HZ.  Among the 69 HZ events, 66 events (95.7%) were limited to cutaneous involvement. 
Visceral HZ was reported in 1 subject (a case of HZ meningitis/encephalitis), which was reported as resolved 
without neurological sequelae after anti-viral treatment.

The IR of OI in UC Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) was higher than those in the RA and PsO programs (all 
exposure) (Table above).  The higher IR of OI in the UC program was predominantly due to the higher IR of 
HZ events adjudicated to be OIs (ie, HZ OIs) in the UC program (1.04/100 PY) compared with RA/PsO (all 
exposure) (0.24/100 PY and 0.27/100 PY, respectively).  The IR of non-HZ OI was <0.3/100 PY across 
indications in the RA and PsO programs (all exposure). 
The applicant suggests that as the UC program was conducted at a later time than the RA and PsO programs, 
the higher IR of HZ OI reported in the UC program may reflect a period effect.  With the accumulation of 
clinical experience and publications on tofacitinib in RA and PsO studies, there have been increased 
awareness and understanding of the risk of HZ associated with tofacitinib treatment.  Compared with the 
Assessment report

earlier RA and PsO studies, increased vigilance in monitoring and increased frequency and details of reporting 
by study sites the UC studies could also have contributed to the higher reported IR of HZ OI in the UC 
program. Since the risk of developing HZ increased with tofacitinib dose, and most of the OIs were HZ 
events, the IR of OIs also increased with tofacitinib dose in Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance (placebo 0.97/100 PY, 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID 1.36/100 PY, tofacitinib 10 mg BID 2.60/100 PY).  These data are indicative of dose-
dependency in the risk of OI in the UC program, driven by the dose-dependency in HZ OI. 
Non-herpes zoster OIs occurred in 4 subjects in UC Cohort 3, and consisted of 1 event each of pulmonary 
cryptococcosis, pulmonary histoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) hepatitis, and CMV colitis.  The infrequent 
occurrence of visceral HZ and non-HZ OIs is consistent across indications in the broader tofacitinib 
development program. 
The applicant has provided a comparative evaluation of AEs for the subpopulation undergoing the extended 
16-week induction regimen and the 8-week induction cohort. The safety profile of the 2nd 8 weeks (first part 
of the LTE) was very similar to that of the initial 8-week induction period. The safety profile of the cumulative 
16-week extended induction period did report a higher overall rate of AEs (71.9%) compared to the initial 8-
week cohort (54.9%) and a slightly higher rate of SAEs (4.7% vs 3.8%) but a comparable rate of 
discontinuations due to AEs. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
As of 16 December 2016, a total of 4 deaths occurred in the entire UC program. After 16 December 2016, 
death was reported in a subject in the LTE Study A3921139 receiving tofacitinib 10 mg BID. The subject 
developed cutaneous melanoma, death occurred approximately 5 months after the last dose of tofacitinib.

Serious adverse events 
In the Tofacitinib All group of Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib), the proportion of subjects with SAEs was 
14.6%. The proportion of subjects with SAEs was 10.8% for predominant dose (PD) 5 mg BID and 15.3% for 
PD 10 mg BID. The proportion of subjects with SAEs was 8.6% for PInd 5 mg BID and 13.4% for PInd 10 mg 
BID  
The most frequently reported SOC for SAEs in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) was 
Gastrointestinal disorders, occurring in 6.5% of subjects in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE 
Tofacitinib). 
Similar to Cohort 1 (P2P3 Induction) and Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance), the most frequently reported PT for 
SAEs in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) was Colitis ulcerative.

In the placebo-controlled studies (Cohort 1 [P2P3 Induction] and Cohort 2 [P3 Maintenance]), the proportion 
of subject with SAEs were similar among the placebo and the tofacitinib groups. 
In Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance), there was no apparent dose dependency in the risk of developing SAEs in 
tofacitinib-treated subjects. 
In Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib), the most frequently reported SOC for SAE was Gastrointestinal disorders 
SOC, and the most frequently reported PT for SAE was Colitis ulcerative. 
With the exception of the preferred term (PT) Colitis ulcerative, there was no clustering of SAEs into specific 
PTs.  
Adverse events of special interest 
The identified AEs of special interest include, Infections (including serious infections, opportunistic infections 
OIs, herpes zoster [all], and tuberculosis [TB]); Malignancies (excluding NMSC), NMSC, major adverse 
cardiovascular event MACE, Hepatic injury cases, including events adjudicated to be Hy’s law cases and those 
assessed to be potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) cases; GI perforation (all cases) and GI perforation 
(revised definition);  Interstitial lung disease (ILD); Select hematologic events (anaemia, neutropenia, 
lymphopenia); AEs of renal impairment and  AEs of CK elevation and rhabdomyolysis. 
Infections (including serious infections, OIs, herpes zoster [all], and tuberculosis [TB]): 
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are predisposed to infections, due to a number of factors 
including older age and concomitant immunomodulatory therapy. 
There were a smaller number of infection events in the UC program compared with the tofacitinib RA 
program, differences in study design could contribute to differences in findings from risk factor analyses 
between the UC and RA programs. For example, in the RA program, a post-baseline confirmed nadir ALC 
<0.5 × 109/L was identified as a risk factor for serious infections. Due to this finding in the RA program, 
subjects with screening ALC <0.5 × 109/L were excluded from the Phase 3 UC induction studies, and 
subjects with confirmed ALC <0.5 × 109/L during treatment were required to be discontinued from the UC 
studies. This would compromise the ability to observe an association between serious infection risk and 
confirmed ALC <0.5 × 109/L in the UC program.

Continuation of tofacitinib 10 mg BID for up to an additional 2 months beyond the 8-week induction 
treatment duration evaluated in the Phase 3 induction studies was not associated with an increase in the risk 
of serious infection (0.7% [2 subjects] in tofacitinib-induction subset of IndNR subgroup data). 
The IR of serious infections in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 was similar to those reported in the 
placebo group in Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance). These data do not suggest an increasing risk of serious infection 
with longer duration of tofacitinib treatment. 
A risk factor analysis showed that the incidence rate of serious infection was higher in subjects with a 
baseline total Mayo score ≥9, BMI ≥30, average post-baseline ANC 1.5 to <2 × 109/L and baseline ALC <1 × 
109/L

occurred less frequently in the UC program compared to the RA program.  It is noted that in the UC program 
subjects with screening ALC <0.5 × 109/L were excluded from the Phase 3 UC induction studies, and 
subjects with confirmed ALC <0.5 × 109/L during treatment were required to be discontinued from the UC 
studies; this was the case in the RA program.  
Serious infections events 
The IR of serious infection was much higher in the subgroup Average post-baseline ANC 1.5 to <2 ×109/L. 
However, it is noted there were only 4 subjects in this category.  
The current SPC includes a recommendation not to initiate dosing in patients with an absolute lymphocyte 
count (ALC) less than 750 cells/mm3 or an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1,000 cells/mm3. 
Herpes Zoster 
An increased IR of herpes zoster (all) was observed with tofacitinib treatment in the RA and PsO programs. 
This is of relevance since data suggests that IBD patients appear to be at higher risk of developing shingles 
(herpes zoster) than healthy subjects. 
There were higher incidence rates for subjects aged over 65 years; those with Diabetes mellitus at baseline, 
those with a history of prior, TNFi experience (versus the TNFi naïve population) and Asian ethnicity.

Herpes zoster reactivation’ as an important identified risk for tofacitinib. Increased rates were seen in 
subjects of Asian race.  
The MAH has conducted a cross-study comparison which shows that the IR of HZ is higher than those 
reported for biologic agents in UC patients in external observational data. 
Opportunistic Infections OI 
Most of the OIs were herpes zoster infections limited to cutaneous involvement, which accounted for 15 out 
of the 22 OI events. Non-herpes zoster OIs consisted of 1 event each of pulmonary cryptococcosis, 
pulmonary histoplasmosis, CMV hepatitis, and CMV colitis. 
In Cohort 1, OI occurred in 3 (0.3%) subjects in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group compared with none in the 
placebo group. Continuation of tofacitinib 10 mg BID for up to an additional 2 months beyond the 8-week 
induction treatment duration evaluated in the Phase 3 induction studies was not associated with an increase 
in the risk of OI. 
In Cohort 2, the IR of OI in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group (2.60 / 100 PY, 4 subjects) was higher than in 
the placebo group (0.97 / 100 PY, 1 subject) or the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group (1.36 / 100 PY, 2 subjects), 
suggesting dose dependency in the risk of developing OI. 
In Cohort 3, the IR of OI (1.28 / 100 PY, 21 subjects) was within the range observed in Cohort 2 (P3 
Maintenance). These data do not suggest an increasing risk of OI with longer duration of tofacitinib 
treatment.

The IR of OI in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 was higher than that reported in the RA and PsO 
programs.  
There was a trend towards an increased IR of OI, driven by herpes-zoster-related OIs, in the TNFi failure 
subgroup for tofacitinib 10 mg BID compared with the non-TNFi failure subgroup. 
Tuberculosis (TB) 
Subjects in the Phase 3 studies were screened for latent and active tuberculosis (TB) infections 
One event of suspected active TB (PT Tuberculosis) was reported in a subject who received tofacitinib 10 mg 
BID in Study A3921139. The event was reviewed by the Opportunistic Infection Review Committee and was 
not confirmed as a TB event. 
The event TB was assessed to be a SAE based on the criterion of medically significant event. 
Malignancies (Excluding Non-melanoma skin cancer NMSC) 
The risk of colorectal cancer has been reported to increase in UC. Risk factors that have been reported to 
predispose to colorectal cancer in patients with IBD include longer duration of disease, greater anatomic 
extent of colitis, greater degree of inflammation, presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis, and a family 
history of colorectal cancer. An increased risk of lymphoma has been reported to be associated with 
concurrent use of thiopurines in IBD patients. Cervical dysplasia has also been reported at an increased rate 
in women with IBD. In IBD patients, an increased risk of NMSC has been associated with past or concurrent 
thiopurine therapy.

All events identified as potential malignancies were assessed by a Malignancy Adjudication Committee. 
In Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance), there were no malignancies (excluding NMSC) in either the tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID or tofacitinib 10 mg BID group. 
In Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib), malignancies were reported in 11 subjects, including 1 subject with 
lymphoma. The IR from primary analysis of 8 subjects with events was 0.48 / 100 PY, and the IR from 
sensitivity analysis of 11 subjects with events was 0.66 / 100 PY. 
There was no clustering of malignancies (excluding NMSC) in tofacitinib-treated subjects into specific types of 
cancer. 
The IR of malignancies (excluding NMSC) in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) was 
similar to those reported for the RA and PsO programs (all exposure) and for biologic agents in UC patients in 
external observational data.

Proportions and Incidence Rates of Malignancies (Excluding NMSC) in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE 
Tofacitinib) 
Malignancies (1 event of hepatic angiosarcoma and 1 event of AML) were reported to be the cause of death in 
2 tofacitinib-treated subjects. In addition, 1 subject who developed cholangiocarcinoma and metastases to 
the peritoneum died, with the cause of death reported to be pulmonary embolism. All 3 deaths occurred in 
the LTE Study A3921139 in subjects assigned to tofacitinib 10 mg BID.  
Among the 11 subjects with malignancies (excluding NMSC), each of the following primary malignancy cancer 
types and PTs was reported in a subject: 
• Cervical cancer (PT Cervical dysplasia) 
• Soft tissue sarcoma (PT Hepatic angiosarcoma) 
• Gallbladder and extrahepatic bile duct cancer (PT Cholangiocarcinoma) 
• Soft tissue sarcoma (cutaneous leiomyosarcoma) 
• Lymphoma/non-Hodgkin lymphoma (PT Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphoma) 
• Renal cancer (PT Renal cell carcinoma) 
• Myeloproliferative neoplasms (PT Essential thrombocythaemia) 
• AML and related precursor neoplasms (PT Acute myeloid leukaemia) 
• Colorectal cancer (PT Adenocarcinoma of colon) 
• Lung cancer (PT Pulmonary mass) 
• Breast cancer (PT Invasive ductal breast carcinoma) 
A total of 12 malignancy events have been identified for the UC programme. All malignancies occurred in 
subjects in the predominant dose 10 mg BID group. Dose dependency for the risk of malignancies with long-
term tofacitinib treatment in UC patients cannot be excluded. 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 130/161 
  
  
 
Malignancy remains an important potential risk, for which there are additional pharmacovigilance activities in 
place.  
Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) 
Cohort 1 (P2P3 Induction): Two (2) events of NMSC were reported in 2 subjects in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID 
group. 
In Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance): NMSC occurred in 3 subjects in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group and in 1 
subject in the placebo group. 
In Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance), there were no NMSC events in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group, whereas the IR 
for tofacitinib 10 mg BID (1.91 / 100 PY, 3 subjects) was higher than for placebo (0.97 / 100 PY, 1 subject).  
In Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib), the SCC:BCC ratio of 7:6 in the Tofacitinib all group suggested an 
immunomodulatory effect. In addition, all SCC events occurred in the PD 10 mg BID dose group. 
In Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib), 18 NMSC malignancy terms were confirmed by adjudication in 11 subjects, 
including the 5 tofacitinib-treated subjects described above (2 in Cohort 1 [P2P3 Induction], and 3 in Cohort 
2 [P3 Maintenance]). Ten (10) of these 11 subjects were in the PD 10 mg BID group. Among the 18 NMSC 
malignancy terms, 16 were AEs. The remaining 2 NMSC malignancy terms corresponded to excisions 
performed for previously reported NMSC events 
There were trends of an increased incidence rate on NMSC in those subject ≥ 65 years, no oral corticosteroid 
use at baseline, prior TNFi failure, prior immunosuppressant treatment, those from North America region and 
those with a BMI ≥30 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 131/161 
  
  
 
Proportions and Incidence Rates of NMSC in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib): 
The IRs of NMSC observed for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID in Cohort 2 were similar to the IRs 
reported in Phase 3 randomized trials of the RA and PsO programs. The IR of NMSC for tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
in Cohort 2 was similar to those of biologic agents in UC patients in published RCTs, while the IR for 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID in Cohort 2 was numerically higher than those of comparators in published RCTs. 
NMSC is an important identified risk of tofacitinib, and is listed as an uncommon ADR in the SmPC. The 
increased risk of NMSC with the 10 mg BID dosing is reflected in the proposed update to the SmPC. 
Cardiovascular Safety 
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events MACE: 
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) were adjudicated externally. MACE was reported in 2 subjects 
in the PD tofacitinib 5 mg BID group (IR 0.55 / 100 PY) and in 2 subjects in the PD tofacitinib 10 mg BID 
group (IR 0.15 / 100 PY). 
In Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance), the IRs of MACE was 0.68 / 100 PY (1 subject) for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, and 
was 0.64 / 100 PY (1 subject) for tofacitinib 10 mg BID compared with none in the placebo group. There was 
no evidence of dose dependency in the risk of MACE. 
The IR of MACE in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) (0.24 / 100 PY, 4 subjects) was 
within the range reported in Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance). These data do not suggest an increasing risk of 
MACE with longer duration of treatment with tofacitinib. 
Based on medical history, 3 out of the 4 subjects with MACE had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 132/161 
  
  
 
The IRs of MACE in the UC program were similar to the IRs reported in randomized Phase 3 trials of the RA 
and PsO programs. The IR of MACE in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) was similar 
to those reported for the RA and PsO programs (all exposure) and for biologic agents in UC patients in 
external observational data. 
GI Perforations 
In the UC program, GI perforation was reported in 3 tofacitinib-treated subjects and in 2 placebo-treated 
subjects. 
In Cohort 1 (P2P3 Induction), GI perforation occurred in 1 (0.1%) subject in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group 
compared with 1 (0.4%) subject in the placebo group. 
In Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance), GI perforation was not reported in the tofacitinib groups but was reported in 1 
subject (IR 0.97 / 100 PY) in the placebo group. There was no evidence of dose dependency of the risk of GI 
perforation 
Two (2) of the 3 GI perforations reported in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) occurred in subjects at high risk 
for GI perforation. 
The IR of GI perforation in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 (0.18 / 100 PY) was within the range reported 
in Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance). These data do not suggest an increasing risk of GI perforation with longer 
treatment duration with tofacitinib. 
The IR of GI perforation (all cases) in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) was similar 
to that reported for biologic agents in UC patients in external observational data. 
The IRs of GI perforation (all cases) for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID in Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance) 
were similar to the IRs reported in Phase 3 randomized trials of the RA and PsO programs. In Cohort 3 
(P2P3LTE Tofacitinib), the IR of GI perforation was numerically higher than those reported for the RA and PsO 
programs.  
The Gastrointestinal Perforation Review Committee (GI PRC), an external, independent adjudication 
committee assessed the occurrence of GI perforations in the tofacitinib UC program. Examination of the 
clinical details of these cases did not suggest a higher risk of GI perforation with tofacitinib treatment in 
subjects with UC. 
The IR of GI perforation (all cases) in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) was similar 
to that reported for biologic agents in UC patients in external observational data. 
Gastrointestinal perforation is retained as an important potential risk. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Compared with placebo, treatment with tofacitinib was associated with small mean increases in 
transaminases.  There was no apparent effect on total bilirubin.  The proportion of subjects with increases in 
transaminases to AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN was low and similar among the tofacitinib groups and the placebo 
group. There were no confirmed Hy’s law cases or DILI cases that were adjudicated to be probable, highly 
likely or definite. There were no AEs suggestive of hepatic failure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 133/161 
  
  
 
 
Number (%) of Subjects With Peak Liver Function Tests at Multiples of ULN – Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE 
Tofacitinib): 
The current SmPC lists ADRs of Hepatic steatosis (uncommon), Hepatic enzyme increased (common), 
Transaminases increased (uncommon), Liver function test abnormal (uncommon), and Gamma glutamyl 
transferase increased (uncommon). This is appropriate. 
Interstitial lung disease 
No cases of adjudicated ILD were reported for the UC programme. 
Laboratory findings 
The laboratory changes seen in the tofacitinib UC program were consistent with those seen previously. They 
include: 
Haemoglobin 
In Cohort 1 (P2P3 Induction) and Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance), tofacitinib treatment did not appear to be 
associated with an increased risk of decreased haemoglobin compared with placebo. Few subjects required 
early termination due to prespecified discontinuation criteria related to decreased haemoglobin. 
Neutrophils 
At the end of 52 weeks of post-induction therapy, small decreases in absolute neutrophil count (ANC), 
generally similar in magnitude to that observed in the placebo group, were observed in tofacitinib-treated 
subjects. Post baseline confirmed ANC <1.5 ×109/L occurred infrequently in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib). 
Absolute lymphocyte count  
At the end of 52 weeks of post-induction therapy, mean decreases in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in 
tofacitinib-treated subjects were larger than that in the placebo group. In Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib), 
11.1% of subjects had ALC <1.0 ×109/L prior to exposure to tofacitinib (i.e., at baseline). In the Tofacitinib 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 134/161 
  
  
 
 
All group, the proportion of subjects with post baseline confirmed ALC <1.0 ×109/L was 19.3%, and 0.9% of 
subjects met the criterion of discontinuation related to decreased ALC (2 consecutive ALC <0.5 × 109/L). The 
proportion of subjects with post baseline confirmed ALC <1.0 ×109/L in Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance) was 
similar to that observed for tofacitinib in randomized Phase 3 RA studies. 
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
Tofacitinib was associated with increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), total-c, high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and triglyceride levels in a dose dependent manner. However, tofacitinib was 
not associated with clinically relevant changes in the ratios of LDL-c/HDL-c or total-c/HDL-c. Taking into 
consideration the findings for placebo, the effect of tofacitinib on serum lipids in subjects with UC were 
generally similar to that reported for RA patients. 
In the current approved SmPC, dyslipidaemia and hyperlipidaemia are listed as common ADRs, and LDL 
increased is listed as uncommon. A recommendation to monitor lipids is included in section 4.4. ‘Lipid 
elevations and hyperlipidaemia’ remains an important identified risk.  
Creatine kinase 
Treatment with tofacitinib resulted in a dose-dependent increase in mean creatine kinase (CK) levels. The 
increase in CK began within the first 2 weeks of treatment and continued up to Week 8, with little change 
after Week 8. There were no reports of rhabdomyolysis in tofacitinib-treated subjects. 
Blood creatine phosphokinase increased is included in the current SmPC as a common ADR. This remains 
acceptable. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors of age, gender, and race were analysed for all AEs, all SAEs, AEDCs, and AEs of special 
interest in subjects treated with tofacitinib in the UC program.  
Age: 
The proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, or AEDCs were numerically higher in subjects ≥65 years of age 
compared with younger subjects, regardless of whether the subjects received tofacitinib or placebo.  
Increasing age was associated with an increased risk of OIs, herpes zoster (all), and NMSC in exploratory 
multivariate analysis using Cox regression. 
The effect of age on proportion with AEs is similar for active treatment and placebo, reflecting increased 
morbidity in older subjects. The RMP safety specification includes the important potential risk ‘Higher 
incidence and severity of adverse events in the elderly’. Section 4.4 includes the warning ‘The elderly 
population in general has an increased risk of adverse events, of increased severity; caution should be used 
when treating the elderly, see section 4.8’. In addition, the increased frequency of serious infections in the 
elderly is covered in section 4.8. The SmPC wording concerning the elderly remains acceptable. 
Gender: 
The proportion of subjects with AEs was numerically higher in female subjects than in male subjects, 
regardless of whether the subject received tofacitinib or placebo. However, there did not appear to be an 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 135/161 
  
  
 
effect of gender on the proportion of subjects with SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation in tofacitinib-
treated subjects.  
Race and Geographic Region:  
Among subjects in Cohort 1 (P2P3 Induction), the majority (80.7%) were white, reflecting the epidemiology 
of UC. The other racial categories were Asian (11.6%), black (0.8%), other (3.9%), and unspecified (3.0%). 
There did not appear to be an effect of race on the proportion of subjects with AEs, SAEs or AEs leading to 
discontinuation in Cohort 2 (P2P3 Maintenance) or Cohort 3 (P2P3 LTE Tofacitinib). 
Compared with the white race, non-white races appeared to be associated with an increased risk of 
developing herpes zoster (all) in the UC program in exploratory multivariate analysis using Cox regression 
analysis.  
Data from the RA and PsO programs suggest that subjects from Japan and Korea have an increased risk of 
developing herpes zoster (all) compared with subjects enrolled from other geographic regions. 
Pregnancy and Lactation: 
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of tofacitinib in pregnant women. Because 
embryofoetal toxicity, including malformations, occurred in embryofoetal development studies in rats and 
rabbits, females of reproductive potential are advised to use effective contraception during treatment with 
tofacitinib and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose. 
Tofacitinib is contraindicated for use in pregnancy and lactation. Tofacitinib has no effect on male fertility, 
sperm motility, or sperm concentration.   
Exposure during Pregnancy in the UC Program 
In the UC program, there were 25 cases of exposure during pregnancy with tofacitinib in the Phase 3 clinical 
trials. Of these 25 cases, 11 (44%) were cases of maternal exposure and 14 (56%) were cases of paternal 
exposure. 
In all 11 maternal cases, exposure to tofacitinib occurred in the first trimester, and the dose of tofacitinib was 
10 mg BID in 9 cases and 5 mg BID in 2 cases. The outcomes in the 11 cases were: 3 normal newborns 
(27%), 1 premature birth (gestational age at birth 36 weeks with normal newborn) (9%), 2 outcome pending 
(18%), 1 medical termination (9%), 2 spontaneous abortions (18%), 1 elective termination (9%) and 1 
unknown (9%). 
In all 14 cases of paternal exposure, exposure to tofacitinib occurred in the first trimester. The dose of 
tofacitinib was 10 mg BID in 11 cases and 5 mg BID in 3 cases. The outcomes of the 14 cases were 11 
normal newborns (79%), 1 outcome pending (7%) and 2 refused consent for follow-up (14%). 
‘Effects on pregnancy and the foetus’ is included as missing information in the RMP safety specification. Use 
in pregnancy and breastfeeding is contraindicated; this remains appropriate.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new data was submitted this was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance), the proportion of subjects who discontinued from study overall was similar 
between the tofacitinib 5 mg BID and tofacitinib 10 mg BID groups (35.4% and 27.0%, respectively) but 
higher in the placebo group (66.7%). Excluding AEs related to worsening UC, study discontinuation due to 
AEs in placebo-controlled studies (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) occurred in similar proportion (<5%) of subjects 
among the placebo and tofacitinib treatment groups. 
There was no apparent dose dependency in the frequency of discontinuation due to AEs in Cohort 2 (P3 
Maintenance). In Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib), excluding AEs related to worsening UC, most AEDCs had a 
single occurrence  
The most frequent reason for study discontinuation in either Cohort 1 (P2P3 Induction) or Cohort 2 (P3 
Maintenance) was insufficient clinical response (i.e., worsening UC).   
Post marketing experience 
On 06 November 2012, XELANZ® (tofacitinib citrate) received its first regulatory approval in the US (US NDA 
203214) at a dose of 5 mg BID for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who 
have had an inadequate response or intolerance to MTX.  
As of 05 November 2016, cumulatively, there have been approximately 61,043 PY of exposure to tofacitinib 
from marketing experience (tofacitinib periodic safety update report [PSUR] 8, Executive Summary). There 
have been a total of 20,074 case reports received during the 4-year reporting period from 06 November 2012 
through 05 November 2016. A total of 55,462 AEs have been reported, most of which, 54,960, were from 
spontaneous sources. The other 496 AEs were reported from non-interventional studies and other 
noninterventional solicited sources. Of the 55,462 AEs, the majority (45,839, 82.6%) were non-serious and 
the remainder (9623, 17.4%) were SAEs. 
The most frequently reported AEs in the 20,074 cases (≥2%) were drug ineffective (14.0%), headache 
(8.2%), condition aggravated (7.1%), arthralgia (6.5%), pain (6.2%%), fatigue (5.9%), nausea (5.4%); 
diarrhoea (5.4%), pain in extremity (4.8%), product use issue (4.8%), malaise (4.1%), RA (3.9%), 
nasopharyngitis (3.7%), peripheral swelling (3.6%), joint swelling (3.2%), HZ (2.9%), abdominal discomfort 
(2.8%), abdominal pain upper (2.7%), cough (2.7%), dizziness (2.7%), musculoskeletal stiffness (2.5%), 
drug dose omission (2.5%), drug effect incomplete (2.4%), sinusitis (2.3%), pneumonia (2.3%), urinary 
tract infection (2.3%), rash (2.2%), weight increased (2.2%), dyspnea (2.1%), and pyrexia (2.0%). 
The most frequently reported SAEs in the 20,074 cases were RA (3.9%), condition aggravated (3.3%), and 
pneumonia (2.3%).  
The frequencies of headache, arthralgia, pain, fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea and pneumonia are consistent with 
the current SmPC table of ADRs.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As of 16 December 2016, a total of 1240 subjects with moderate-to-severe UC received at least 1 dose of 
placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg BID or tofacitinib 10 mg BID. Among these subjects, 1157 subjects received at least 
1 dose of tofacitinib 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID, with 762 subjects exposed to tofacitinib for at least 6 months, 
and 653 subjects exposed for at least 12 months. In total, the UC program encompasses 1613 patient-years 
(PY) of exposure to tofacitinib, with up to 4.4 years of tofacitinib treatment. The exposure is adequate.  
In the UC tofacitinib treatment group, AEs were reported in 82.1% of subjects, and the most frequently 
occurring AEs (all causalities) were in the Infections and infestations System Organ Class (SOC) (42.8% of 
subjects) and GI disorders SOC (38.0% of subjects), and the most frequently occurring preferred terms (PTs) 
for AEs were Colitis ulcerative (19.4% of subjects) and Nasopharyngitis. 
In the tofacitinib treatment group the proportion of subjects with SAEs was 14.6%. The proportion of 
subjects with SAEs was 10.8% for PD 5 mg BID and 15.3% for PD 10 mg BID. The proportion of subjects 
with SAEs was 8.6% for PInd 5 mg BID and 13.4% for PInd 10 mg BID.  In the placebo-controlled studies, 
the proportion of subject with SAEs were similar among the placebo and the tofacitinib groups. 
In Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance), there was no apparent dose dependency in the risk of developing SAEs in 
tofacitinib-treated subjects. 
The most frequently reported SOC for SAEs in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) was 
Gastrointestinal disorders, occurring in 6.5% of subjects in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE 
Tofacitinib). 
There was no data do not suggest an increasing risk of serious infection with longer duration of tofacitinib 
treatment. The IR of serious infection was much higher in the subgroup average post-baseline Absolute 
Neutrophil Count 1.5 to <2 ×109/L. However, it is noted there were only 4 subjects in this category. 
The safety profile for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID in the UC program (Cohort 3 [P2P3LTE 
Tofacitinib]), was consistent with that of the tofacitinib RA and PsO programs and was similar to that of 
biologic agents approved for treatment of UC. However, the exception was a higher IR of Herpes Zoster (HZ). 
Herpes zoster reactivation is an important identified risk for tofacitinib. Dose dependency for the risk of 
Herpes Zoster (HZ) and opportunistic infections (OIs) (mainly HZ) and NMSC was observed in the overall 
population treated with tofacitinib in the UC program. There was a trend toward an increased risk of HZ and 
NMSC in the TNFi-failure subgroup compared with the non-TNFi-failure subgroup. This is appropriately stated 
in the Product information. 
The IRs of serious infection, HZ, and opportunistic infections (OI) in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 
(P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) were similar to those reported in Cohort 2 (P3 Maintenance). The current data do not 
suggest an increasing risk of developing these safety events of special interest with longer duration of 
tofacitinib treatment and adequate risk minimisation activities are in place. 
A total of 12 malignancy events have been identified for the UC programme. All malignancies occurred in 
subjects in the predominant dose 10 mg BID group. Dose dependency for the risk of malignancies with long-
term tofacitinib treatment in UC patients cannot be excluded. Malignancy remains an important potential risk, 
for which there are additional pharmacovigilance activities in place.  
The IRs of MACE in the UC program were similar to the IRs reported in randomized Phase 3 trials of the RA 
and PsO programs. The IR of MACE in the Tofacitinib All group in Cohort 3 (P2P3LTE Tofacitinib) was similar 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 138/161 
  
  
to those reported for the RA and PsO programs (all exposure) and for biologic agents in UC patients in 
external observational data. 
As of 16 December 2016, a total of 4 deaths occurred in the entire UC program. After 16 December 2016, 
death was reported in a subject in the LTE Study A3921139. 3 of the deaths were related to malignancies. 
The laboratory changes seen in the tofacitinib UC program were consistent with those seen previously. 
In the UC program, there were 25 cases of exposure during pregnancy with tofacitinib, but no definite 
evidence of teratogenicity. Tofacitinib is contraindicated in pregnancy. 
The most frequent reason for study discontinuation was insufficient clinical response.  In maintenance study, 
the proportion of subjects who discontinued due to insufficient clinical response was higher in the placebo 
group than in the tofacitinib groups. Excluding AEs related to worsening UC, study discontinuation due to AEs 
in placebo-controlled studies occurred in similar proportions (<5%) of subjects among the placebo and 
tofacitinib treatment groups suggesting tofacitnib was well tolerated. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The observed safety profile for the UC database is in line with the known safety profile based on the RA 
clinical database and post-marketing experience and was similar to that of biologic agents approved for 
treatment of UC. However, the exception was a higher IR of Herpes Zoster (HZ).  Dose dependency for the 
risk of Herpes Zoster (HZ) and opportunistic infections (OIs) (mainly HZ) and NMSC was observed in the 
overall population treated with tofacitinib in the UC program. 
Malignancy remains an important potential risk, for which there are additional pharmacovigilance activities in 
place.

2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Xeljanz (tofacitinib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The target indication applied for by the MAH is for the induction and maintenance of treatment of adult 
patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response, lost 
response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent.  
UC is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disease of the colon characterized by alternating episodes of 
remission and spontaneous relapse. The primary treatment goal is to induce remission and then to maintain 
this state. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current therapy for the treatment of UC includes 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), systemic and/or topical 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants such as azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and cyclosporine, and 
tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFis), and recently approved α4β7 integrin antagonist vedolizumab. 
A significant proportion of UC patients still require colectomy for refractory or severe fulminant disease, or in 
some cases for cancer prevention. At present, no current pharmacological therapy is able to provide a full 
cure for UC.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted are the pivotal phase 3 studies which consisted of two identically 
conducted studies to investigate efficacy in induction of remission (studies A3921094 and A3921095) and one 
examining efficacy in maintenance of remission study A3921096). All three studies A3921094, A3921095 and 
A3921096 were multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety studies in 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 148/161 
  
  
patients with moderate to severely active disease. Subjects were selected based on a diagnosis of UC for 
more than four months prior to entry into the study, with a histological conformation. Moderately to severely 
active disease was defined by a total Mayo score of >6, with a rectal bleeding score of >1, and an endoscopic 
subscore of >2 on the Mayo score determined within 10 days of baseline visit. Appropriate measures of 
diagnosis and disease severity were utilised for subject selection. 
In studies A3921094 and A3921095 subjects were randomized to either tofacitinib 10 mg BID or placebo 
BID, with a treatment allocation ratio of 4:1. Subjects were stratified by previous treatment with TNFi 
therapy, oral corticosteroid use at baseline, and geographic region. Active treatment in the study continued 
for 8 weeks 
Subjects who completed either of the induction studies and achieved clinical response or remission 
irrespective of treatment were re-randomized into the maintenance study A3921096. Subjects were 
randomized to either tofacitinib 10 mg BID, tofacitinib 5 mg BID or placebo BID with an allocation ratio of 
1:1:1.  The study was conducted as a 52-week double-blind treatment period followed by a 4 week safety 
follow-up for subjects who did not participate in the open-label study (A3921139). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the phase 3 induction studies A3921094 and A3921095 the primary endpoint was remission which was 
achieved in 18.5% in study A3921094 and 16.6% in study A3921095 of subjects on tofacitinib 10mg BID, 
placebo rates were 8.2%; difference 10.3; 95% CI 4.3, 16.3; p-value 0.0070 and 3.6%; difference 13.0; 
95% CI 8.1, 19.7; P-value 0.0005 respectively. The key secondary endpoint was mucosal healing which in 
study A3921094 was achieved in 31.3% in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group and 15.6% of the placebo group 
(difference 15.7, 95% CI 8.1, 23.4, P-value 0.0005). In study A3921095 mucosal healing was achieved in 
28.4% in the 10mg BID tofacitinib group and 11.6% in the placebo group; difference 16.8 95% CI 9.5. 24.1 
p= 0.0002). 
The results of the 2 replicate induction studies show consistent and statistically significant findings with 
similar magnitudes of placebo-adjusted treatment effect for tofacitinib 10 mg BID across endpoints. 
Across endpoints, treatment effect was observed in the refractory TNFi subgroups, including subjects with 
prior TNFi exposure or failure, those subjects with prior failure to 2 or more TNFi agents, and those with 
primary non-response to TNFi. In study A3921094 those with prior TNFi failure remission rates were 11.1% 
in the tofacitinib 10mg BID group compared to 1.6% in placebo. In those without prior TNFi failure remission 
was demonstrated in 26.2% in the treatment group and 15.5% in the placebo group. In study A3921095 
those with prior TNFi failure remission rates were 11.7% in the tofacitinib 10mg BID group compared to 0.0% 
in placebo group. In those without prior TNFi failure remission was demonstrated in 21.7% in the treatment 
group and 7.7% in the placebo group. 
In the phase 3 maintenance study A3921096 the primary endpoint was remission which in the tofacitinib 5mg 
BID group was 34.3%; 10mg BID 40.6% and placebo 11.1%. For the end point of sustained corticosteroid-
free remission 35.4% in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID; 47.3 in tofacitinib 10 mg BID and 5.1 in placebo. Mucosal 
healing was achieved in 37.4 % in the 5mg tofacitinib; 45.7 in the 10mg tofacitinib and 13.1% in the placebo 
group. These three endpoints were all statistically different from placebo p<0.0001.  
Across the primary and key secondary endpoints, treatment effect was observed in the TNFi subgroups, 
including subjects with prior TNFi exposure or failure and those with primary non-response to TNFi. The 
magnitude of observed treatment effects was similar for subjects treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 149/161 
  
  
tofacitinib 10 mg BID in the subgroups of subjects without prior TNFi exposure or failure. In contrast, there 
was a clinically meaningful observed treatment difference between tofacitinib 10 mg BID and 5 mg BID in the 
subgroup of subjects with prior TNFi failure, with differences between the 2 tofacitinib groups ranging from 
9.7 to 16.7 percentage points across the primary and key secondary endpoints. Sustained corticosteroid free 
remission in those at remission at baseline was 22.2% in 5mg BID, 38.9% 10mg BID and 4.8 % placebo in 
those who had failed prior TNFi therapy. Compared to 40.4%, 51.4% and 5.3% in those who had not had 
prior failure to TNFi therapy. 
With regards to patient related outcomes in both induction and maintenance studies there were 
improvements in the EuroQoL 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) and various domains of the Work Productivity and 
Activity Impairment (WPAI-UC) questionnaire. There was also greater improvement compared to placebo 
from baseline in in the total and all 4 domain scores of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) 
for all three clinical studies.  
Data from the ongoing LTE study provided evidence that an extended period of induction of 16 weeks (an 
additional 8 weeks of 10 mg BID dosing beyond the initial 8-week induction phase) is of benefit in patients 
failing to achieve an adequate response to the initial 8-weeks induction regimen. Of these subjects who failed 
to show a clinical response at 8 weeks induction who enrolled in the LTE (295/905 subjects), 51.2% achieved 
clinical response and 8.6% remission at 16 weeks (8 weeks of the LTE). In addition, further data are reported 
that show additional responders at 16 weeks that were not evident at 8 weeks. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
For the induction studies A3921094 and A3921095 the primary efficacy endpoint in the induction studies was 
remission which was defined by a total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 
1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Ideally the co-primary endpoints on both symptomatic relief and 
endoscopic healing would have been utilised in line with the CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Guideline on the 
development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis. The total Mayo score including 
the PGA is not of primary interest. It is however noted that the chosen definition of remission did refer to all 
sub scores of the Mayo score and as such did encompass both symptomatic and endoscopic evaluation and in 
addition included cessation of rectal bleeding in the definition and as such is acceptable. It was noted that the 
remission rates in the induction studies were only 18.5% in study A3921094 and 16.6% in study A3921095.  
For the maintenance study A3921096 the primary efficacy endpoint was remission at Week 52, defined by a 
Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore 
of 0. The key secondary endpoints were mucosal healing at Week 52, defined by a Mayo endoscopic subscore 
of 0 or 1; and sustained corticosteroid-free remission at both Weeks 24 and 52 among subjects in remission 
at baseline defined by a Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a 
rectal bleeding subscore of 0, in addition to not requiring any treatment with corticosteroids for at least 4 
weeks prior to the visit. CHMP Draft guidelines CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1 Guideline on the development 
of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis, advise that the primary endpoint should be 
the number of patients in clinical and endoscopic remission in whom steroids could be withdrawn. As such the 
relevance of the second key secondary efficacy endpoint was highlighted and is viewed as a primary endpoint 
in assessment. In the maintenance study, there were a high number of subjects (51.0%) who discontinued 
the study (including 43.9% of subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group, 35.7% of subjects in the tofacitinib 
10 mg BID group, and 73.2% in the placebo group).  The MAH acknowledged that the discontinuation rate 
due to ICR is analogous to the clinical efficacy results, whereby the increment in efficacy between 5mg BID 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 150/161 
  
  
and 10mg BID regimens was larger in those with a history of TNFi failure, especially for the highly relevant 
endpoint of sustained corticosteroid-free remission amongst remitters. 
There was no direct active comparator in the clinical trials.  There are many challenges of indirect comparison 
of trials in UC with the variability in subject selection, previous therapies, concomitant medications endpoint 
definitions and study methodology, thus only limited conclusions with regards to efficacy or safety of 
tofacitinib with comparison to existing therapies can be made. Taking these limitations into account it could 
be inferred that the observed treatment effect of tofacitinib 10 mg BID in Studies A3921094 and A3921095 
was at least similar to the historical Phase 3 results of Golimumab, Vedolizumab and Adalimumab for clinical 
remission. The treatment effect for tofacitinib was lower than of infliximab, although it should be noted that 
the study populations were different, including differences in prior treatment experience and allowed 
concomitant medicines, thus making clear conclusions difficult.  Clinical remission was defined as a total 
Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point, at week as opposed to the 
remission which included rectal bleeding, i.e. Remission was defined by a total Mayo score of 2 points or 
lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 at week 8. 
Estimated induction treatment effects (difference from placebo) for clinical remission: 
The observed induction treatment effect of tofacitinib 10 mg BID in subjects without prior failure or exposure 
to TNFi agents was considered at least similar to that of the same subgroup of subjects in the comparable 
development programs.  In addition, the observed induction treatment effect for tofacitinib in the 
subpopulation of patients with prior TNFi exposure or failure in the Phase 3 studies was numerically larger 
than that observed for adalimumab and vedolizumab.  There are no placebo controlled data available in this 
Assessment report

subpopulation (those with prior failure of TNFi agents) for infliximab or golimumab.  Furthermore, the 
exclusion of TNFi primary non-responders in the adalimumab trial in effect limited their TNFi failure subjects 
to only TNFi secondary non-responders, who are generally viewed as less refractory than TNFi primary non-
responders. 
In the maintenance study, the observed treatment effect of tofacitinib 5 mg BID and tofacitinib 10 mg BID 
was similar to or greater than the observed treatment effects for the historical Phase 3 results of the 
currently approved treatments. 
Estimated maintenance treatment effects (difference from placebo) for clinical remission: 
As discussed the indirect comparison with second line agents for UC is challenging and only limited inferences 
may be made from the submitted data.  
Similar to the tofacitinib induction studies, the endpoints of remission and clinical remission were nearly 
identical and results based on local reading were numerically higher than those based on central reading.  
The endpoint that is common across the development programs is clinical remission using local read. Among 
the approved therapies, vedolizumab appears to have the best treatment effect in maintenance.  Despite the 
differences in concomitant medications allowed, when tofacitinib is compared to vedolizumab, the difference 
from placebo in the proportion of clinical remitters for tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID was similar to that 
observed with vedolizumab. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
A total of 1,157 patients (Phase 2, 3, and long-term extension study) were treated with at least 1 dose of 5 
mg or 10 mg twice daily with a mean duration of 1.4 years (based on up to 4.4 years of exposure), and 
1,613 patient-years of accumulated total drug exposure to Xeljanz. 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 152/161 
  
  
 
In the UC tofacitinib treatment group, AEs were reported in 82.1% of subjects, and the most frequently 
occurring AEs (all causalities) were in the Infections and infestations System Organ Class (SOC) (42.8% of 
subjects) and GI disorders SOC (38.0% of subjects), and the most frequently occurring preferred terms (PTs) 
for AEs were Colitis ulcerative (19.4% of subjects) and Nasopharyngitis 
In the entire treatment experience with XELJANZ, the most commonly reported infection was 
nasopharyngitis, occurring in 18.2% of patients (211 patients). In the entire treatment experience with 
Xeljanz, the overall incidence rate of infections was 60.3 events per 100 patient-years (involving 49.4% of 
patients; total 572 patients). 
The safety profile for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID in the UC program (Cohort 3 [P2P3LTE 
Tofacitinib]), was consistent with that of the tofacitinib RA and PsO programs and was similar to that of 
biologic agents approved for treatment of UC. However, the exception was a higher IR of Herpes Zoster (HZ). 
Herpes zoster reactivation is an important identified risk for tofacitinib. 
Dose dependency for the risk of Herpes Zoster (HZ) and opportunistic infections (OIs) (mainly HZ) and NMSC 
was observed in the overall population treated with tofacitinib in the UC program. There was a trend toward 
an increased risk of HZ and NMSC in the TNFi-failure subgroup compared with the non-TNFi-failure subgroup. 
Patients with an ALC less than 1,000 cells/mm3 may have an increased risk of herpes zoster.  
A total of 12 malignancy events have been identified for the UC programme. All malignancies occurred in 
subjects in the predominant dose 10 mg BID group. Dose dependency for the risk of malignancies with long-
term tofacitinib treatment in UC patients cannot be excluded. Malignancy remains an important potential risk, 
for which there are additional pharmacovigilance activities in place.  
The IRs of MACE in the UC program were similar to the IRs reported in randomized Phase 3 trials of the RA 
and PsO programs. The IR of MACE in the Tofacitinib All group was similar to those reported for the RA and 
PsO programs (all exposure) and for biologic agents in UC patients in external observational data. 
As of 16 December 2016, a total of 4 deaths occurred in the entire UC program. After 16 December 2016, 
death was reported in a subject in the LTE Study A3921139. 3 of the deaths were related to malignancies. 
The laboratory changes seen in the tofacitinib UC program were consistent with those seen previously. 
Tofacitinib has been shown to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits, and to affect parturition and peri/postnatal 
development. In the UC program, there were 25 cases of exposure during pregnancy with tofacitinib, but no 
definite evidence of teratogenicity. Tofacitinib is contraindicated in pregnancy. 
The most frequent reason for study discontinuation was insufficient clinical response.  In maintenance study, 
the proportion of subjects who discontinued due to insufficient clinical response was higher in the placebo 
group than in the tofacitinib groups. Excluding AEs related to worsening UC, study discontinuation due to AEs 
in placebo-controlled studies occurred in similar proportions (<5%) of subjects among the placebo and 
tofacitinib treatment groups suggesting that tofacitinib was well tolerated. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The risks of tofacitinib beyond 1 year among patients with ulcerative colitis are unknown. The safety profile 
for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID in the UC program (Cohort 3 [P2P3LTE Tofacitinib]), was consistent 
with that of the tofacitinib RA and PsO programs and was similar to that of biologic agents approved for 
treatment of UC. The exception was a higher IR of Herpes Zoster (HZ). Herpes zoster reactivation’ is an 
Assessment report

important identified risk for tofacitinib. The risk of Herpes Zoster is appropriately reflected in the SmPC and 
will be followed up upon in post authorisation registries together with the general long term safety profile of 
tofacitinib in Ulcerative Collitis.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The pivotal induction studies A3921094 and A3921095 were appropriately designed. For the primary endpoint 
of remission superiority has been demonstrated to placebo for Tofacitinib 10 mg BID for 8 weeks; in 
induction treatment in subjects with moderately to severely active UC who failed or were intolerant to at least 
1 protocol specified UC treatment, either corticosteroids, AZA/6-MP, or TNFi therapy. Statistical significantly 
benefit was also demonstrated for the relevant secondary endpoints.  
For the pivotal maintenance study A3921096, the primary endpoint presented was remission at 52 weeks. 
However, though sustained corticosteroid steroid free remission in those at remission at baseline was 
presented as a secondary endpoint, in line with the CHMP guidance this should be viewed as a primary 
analysis endpoint. The applicant initially claimed separate indications on induction and maintenance of 
remission however agreed on CHMP request to update the wording to treatment of  adult patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018 
Page 157/161 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) to fulfil the draft EMA UC guideline as well as to be 
consistent with the wording of others biologic therapies. The proportion of subjects in sustained 
corticosteroid-free remission among subjects in remission at baseline was statistically significantly greater in 
both the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group compared with the placebo group. 
Tofacitinib 5 mg BID and Tofacitinib 10 mg BID were also superior to placebo for the primary endpoint of 
remission at Week 52, and other relevant secondary endpoints. For the refractory sub-group of patients who 
have previously failed TNFi agents, a clear treatment effect of tofacitinib was evident for induction of 
remission, and was particularly evident for maintenance of remission in the 10 mg BID dosing. 
Overall the clinical efficacy has been adequately demonstrated. A clinically relevant benefit for tofacitinib has 
been demonstrated in patients with moderately to severely active UC who failed or were intolerant to at least 
one of the specified UC treatments of either corticosteroids, AZA/6-MP, or TNFi therapy. Tofacitinib offers a 
different mode of action to other targeted treatments in UC. The oral formulation may also be an advantage 
for some patients. The issue of compliance with oral therapy in relapsing/remitting conditions such as UC 
outside of the clinical trial setting is acknowledged. 
The observed safety profile for the UC database is in line with the known safety profile based on the RA 
clinical database and post-marketing experience and was similar to that of biologic agents approved for 
treatment of UC. However, the exception was a higher IR of Herpes Zoster (HZ).  Dose dependency for the 
risk of Herpes Zoster, OI (predominantly due to HZ) and NMSC was observed in the overall population 
treated with tofacitinib in the UC program. 
The risks of serious or opportunistic infections are important. However, these risks are mitigated by the 
precautions and warnings included in the SmPC, and these adverse reactions are generally manageable. The 
potential risk of malignancy continues to be investigated. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits of Xeljanz 5 mg and 10mg film-coated tablets outweigh the risks, for the treatment of adult 
patients with moderately to severely active UC who failed or were intolerant to at least one of the specified 
UC treatments of either corticosteroids, AZA/6-MP, or TNFi therapy. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xeljanz is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of, Xeljanz 10mg and 5mg, film-coated tablets  is favourable in the following indication: 
XELJANZ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis 
(UC) who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy 
or a biologic agent (see section 5.1)  
Assessment report  
EMA/414633/2018

1.  Introduction 
In accordance with the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) Pfizer Limited has applied for an additional one year marketing protection 
period in the framework of Xeljanz procedure (EMEA/H/C/004214/X/0005/G). 
The request was based on the MAH's position that Xeljanz represents a significant clinical benefit in the 
proposed indication of ‘the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a biologic agent’ in comparison with existing therapies. 
2.  Justification of significant clinical benefit as presented by 
the MAH 
2.1.  Demonstration of new therapeutic indication 
The European Commission granted a Marketing Authorisation for Xeljanz on 22 March 2017 in the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with 5 mg film coated tablets. This is an application for a Grouped 
Type II Variation (new indication) / Line Extension (10 mg new tablet strength) for Xeljanz (tofacitinib) 
in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC).   
The MAA for the initial authorisation of Xeljanz comprised the following indication: treatment of 
moderate to severe RA in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to 
one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. 
The MAH now seeks the inclusion of the following proposed indication: for the treatment of adult 
patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate 
response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent. 
The variation application is based on the submission of 1 Phase 2 and 3 Phase 3 studies, and an 
interim clinical study report from an ongoing open-label, long-term extension study of tofacitinib in 
patients with UC. The phase 2 dose finding study evaluated a 30-fold dose range in moderately to 
severely active UC patients. The pivotal phase 3 studies consisted of two identically conducted studies 
to investigate efficacy in induction of remission and one study examining efficacy in maintenance of 
remission. 
2.2.  Details of existing therapies 
Current therapy for the treatment of UC includes 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), systemic and/or topical 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants such as azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and cyclosporine, 
and tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFis), and the α4β7 integrin antagonist vedolizumab.

The MAH states that there are 2 main classes of drugs available to patients in Europe with UC that can 
be used for both induction and maintenance therapy for patients with moderately to severely active 
UC: TNFi and anti-integrin therapy.  
The applicant has discussed the fact that a proportion of patients with moderately to severely active 
UC fail to respond to TNFi agents either initially (primary non-response) or lose their initial response 
(secondary non-response).5,6,7  
Vedolizumab, an anti-integrin, has documented efficacy in induction and maintenance,4,11. The 
induction benefit of vedolizumab in patients who have previously failed TNFi agents is induction 
remission rate 9.8% vedolizumab to 3.2% placebo. 12 
The MAH cites a recent paper which discusses that patients who exhibit primary non-response to one 
TNFi are more likely to show poor response to a different TNFi,15 and that secondary non-responders 
have poor response when switching to another TNFi.15 
The MAH has discussed the oral mode of administration of Xeljanz as a benefit. All currently approved 
therapies for both induction and maintenance of moderately to severely active UC are administered 
either intravenously or subcutaneously.  
2.3.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy 
As supportive data to the justification for significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to 
patient care, the MAH has compared the UC tofacitinib data with historical data from currently 
approved treatments. 
Figure 1 summarizes the treatment effects for clinical remission and their 95% CIs of tofacitinib 10 mg 
twice daily (BID) induction therapy for the overall population and historical Phase 3 data from currently 
approved treatments for patients with moderately to severely active UC. For consistency across 
studies, locally read endoscopy results are presented for tofacitinib.

The observed treatment effect of tofacitinib 10 mg BID in Studies A3921094 and A3921095 was at 
least similar to the historical Phase 3 results of Golimumab, Vedolizumab and Adalimumab. The 
treatment effect for tofacitinib was lower than of infliximab, but the differences in endpoint definition, 
prior treatment experience and allowed concomitant medications are considered too large to ascertain 
whether the differences are due to drug activity or study design.  
The submitted clinical phase 3 trials in the current application demonstrated induction efficacy in those 
with prior TNFi. Similar induction efficacy was shown between those with and those without prior TNFi 
failure. 
Figure 2 summarizes the treatment effects for clinical remission and their 95% CIs of tofacitinib 10 mg 
BID induction therapy for the TNFi failure subpopulation and historical Phase 3 data from currently 
approved treatments for patients with moderately to severely active UC. 
Figure 3 summarizes the treatment effects at 1 year for clinical remission in maintenance and the 95% 
CIs for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID and historical Phase 3 data from currently approved 
treatments for patients with moderately to severely active UC.

Although relatively limited, available results of maintenance clinical remission rates by various 
subgroups were provided for tofacitinib and the biologic agents using local endoscopy for the endpoint 
of clinical remission.  Due to differences in subgroup definitions, interpretation of results based on age 
and concomitant corticosteroid use should be approached with caution.   
With regards to prior TNFi experience, vedolizumab exhibited the best response relative to other 
approved agents both in patients who had TNF failure and those who did not.  As noted above, 
vedolizumab is the development program that most resembles the tofacitinib development program for 
UC, but some differences such as the allowance of use of immunosuppressants with vedolizumab still 
exist.  When clinical remission maintenance results are analysed by prior TNFi experience, the placebo-
adjusted proportion of responders at either dose of tofacitinib was numerically higher than that of 
vedolizumab for patients who had not failed TNFi agents.  For patients with prior TNFi failure, the 
results for tofacitinib 5 mg BID were numerically lower that vedolizumab but numerically higher than 
adalimumab, while the results of tofacitinib 10 mg BID were similar to those observed with 
vedolizumab.

Throughout the maintenance studies of tofacitinib and the biologic agents, the endpoint of remission 
has been assessed based on whether it was sustained and/or based on the ability to achieve steroid-
free remission among subjects receiving steroids at baseline.  Results for these endpoints are included 
in the table below.  Where available, results are presented for the mFAS population for tofacitinib.  As 
previously discussed, the tofacitinib maintenance study was the first to include the endpoint of 
sustained (ie, at both Week 24 and Week 52) steroid-free remission among subjects in remission at 
baseline of the maintenance study. Close to half of the patients who entered into the maintenance 
study in remission achieved this endpoint.  The endpoint of sustained remission was analyzed in the 
maintenance studies for tofacitinib as well as all of the biologic studies.  Although there are differences

in the timepoints evaluated, the treatment effects for both tofacitinib 5 mg BID and tofacitinib 10 mg 
BID were numerically larger than those for the biologic agents. 
There are limitations to comparing results across studies.  The tofacitinib UC development program 
included patients who were highly treatment experienced, were required to taper corticosteroids and 
used more stringent definitions of response.  All these characteristics make the comparison of results 
between tofacitinib and biologics be conservative estimates of the true value of tofacitinib.  Despite all

these considerations, the results observed with tofacitinib for clinical remission (in induction and 
maintenance), based both on the overall population as well as by various subgroups, were generally 
similar to or numerically larger than those of the biologic agents.  Overall, this is relevant for the 
discussion on the potential for tofacitinib to show significant clinical benefit in comparison to available 
therapies in patients who have failed TNF is, as this is a growing population in need of multiple new 
options. 
The observed treatment effect of tofacitinib 5 mg BID and tofacitinib 10 mg BID was at least similar to 
the observed treatment effects for the historical Phase 3 results of the currently approved biologic 
treatments; in the induction and maintenance of treatment.  
2.4.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety 
The safety data from the UC clinical program showed that the safety profile of tofacitinib treatment in 
the UC population appeared to be consistent with tofacitinib treatment in the RA population.  
In general, the IRs of AEs of special interest were similar across the UC, RA and PsO indications, 
except for the IR of opportunistic infection (OI). The IR of OI in the overall tofacitinib UC program was 
higher than in the overall RA or PsO programs, primarily attributable to an increased rate of herpes 
zoster OIs. In the Phase 3 UC maintenance study, there was evidence of a dose response for HZ (all 
cases, OI or non-OI), which was consistent with previous observations in the tofacitinib RA and PsO 
indications.

The MAH has compared external safety data from UC patients in a claims-based comparison cohort 
(Truven Marketscan database) with the safety findings from the UC program. Phase 2, Phase 3 and 
Long-Term Extension study data for tofacitinib were presented alongside data from the Truven 
comparison cohort (Table 4). The IRs of HZ for tofacitinib was higher than that of TNFi agents, 
whereas the IRs of serious infection and Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) for tofacitinib were 
numerically lower than those of TNFi agents. The IRs of other adverse events (AE) of special interest 
were similar between tofacitinib and TNFi agents. 
2.5.  Significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care 
The Applicant states that there is a significant unmet need in patients with moderately to severely 
active UC who have previously failed corticosteroids, AZA/6-MP, or TNFi. And that there is no single 
currently approved therapeutic option that offers both induction and maintenance efficacy, in TNFi 
failure patients.   
A proportion of patients with moderately to severely active UC fail to respond to TNFi agents either 
initially or lose their initial response. For example, only approximately half of patients with moderately 
to severely active UC had a clinical response and less than 20% were in remission after adalimumab 
(Week 8)5 or golimumab (Week 6) induction.6 Even after initially achieving a clinical response, 33%-
50% of patients subsequently lose their response.8,9 Considering the outcome following 1-year 
treatment, approximately one-third of patients were still in clinical remission after 1 year of infliximab 
therapy in their pivotal trials.7 In a real-word setting based on a Spanish IBD registry study of UC 
patients treated with adalimumab, 28% of patients did not have a clinical response at any time during 
the 1-year follow up, and 47% did not achieve clinical remission at any time during the first year of

treatment. More than one-third of patients required dose escalation due to loss of response. In 16% of 
patients, secondary loss of response led to adalimumab discontinuation during follow up.10 
Patients who have failed TNFi, whether primary or secondary non-response, have limited treatment 
options given the limited effectiveness of other TNFi agents or vedolizumab in these patients. For this 
patient population, colectomy may be the only remaining option. It has been reported that 21% of 
subjects required colectomy after 1 year of adalimumab. The rate was significantly higher in TNFi 
exposed (26%) than naïve patients (10%), indicating patients who have previously received TNFi 
therapy may have more difficult-to-treat disease.15 More than half of patients treated with TNFi 
experience treatment failure, either primary or secondary 8,9.  
All currently approved therapies for both induction and maintenance of moderately to severely active 
UC are administered either intravenously (3 infusions over 6 weeks initially) or subcutaneously (3-6 
injections over 2 weeks initially).19,20,21,22 The route of administration of these biologic therapies may 
be undesirable for many patients.  
3.  Assessment of the MAH's justification of significant 
clinical benefit 
3.1.  Demonstration of new therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication for Xeljanz in this application is treatment of adult patients with moderately to 
severely  active  ulcerative  colitis  (UC)  who  have  had  an  inadequate  response,  lost  response,  or  were 
intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent’ in comparison with existing therapies.  
It is agreed that the proposed indication is considered a new indication for Xeljanz, as this indication is 
targeting a new disease target in comparison to the authorised indications.  
3.2.  Details of existing therapies 
The MAH review of existing therapies is satisfactory and agreed upon.  
3.3.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy 
There are no direct comparative studies of tofacitinib against approved biologics in patients with 
moderate to severely active UC. There are many challenges of indirect comparison of trials in 
ulcerative colitis, with the variability in subject selection, previous therapies, concomitant medications 
endpoint definitions and study methodology, thus only limited conclusions with regards to efficacy or 
safety of tofacitinib with comparison to existing therapies can be made. The indirect comparison with 
second line agents for UC is challenging. Taking these limitations into account it could be inferred from 
the presented literature that the efficacy of tofacitinib in the induction and maintenance of remission is 
at least similar to those currently approved.  The results for tofacitinib are comparable in induction and 
maintenance of remission, and compare favourably against approved biologics for clinical remission in 
patients with prior TNFi failure (particularly for the 10 mg BID dosing) and for corticosteroid-free

remission. However, with prior TNFi failure patients the difference in maintenance of clinical remission 
from placebo was 35.2% in tofacitinib and 31.9% in vedolizumab patients, which does not imply 
“exceptional benefit” compared to vedolizumab. Also, for steroid-free remission the difference from 
placebo was 18.8% for tofacitinib, 17.5% for vedolizumab and 16.9% for infliximab (7.6% for 
adalimumab; in “sustained steroid-free remission” also adalimumab was similar to tofacitinib), barely 
representing a significant or exceptional clinical benefit. 
Therefore the CHMP considers that the indirect comparisons submitted by the MAH do not demonstrate 
major differences in efficacy (or “exceptional benefit”) in the the claimed indication for XELJANZ 
compared to currently approved biologic agents. Significant clinical benefit over existing therapies 
based on improved efficacy has not been demonstrated. 
3.4.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety 
The MAH has conducted an indirect comparison between the safety profile of tofacitinib and a claims-
based comparison cohort (Truven Marketscan database). The incidence rates of Herpes Zoster for 
tofacitinib was higher than that of TNFi agents, whereas the incidence rates of serious infection and 
Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) for tofacitinib were numerically lower than those of TNFi agents. 
There is no conclusive direct evidence that there is improved safety with Xeljanz in comparison to 
currently authorised products. However, the safety profile does appear to be similar between 
tofacitinib and TNFi agents from the presented literature indirect comparisons.  
Having considered the data submitted by the MAH, the CHMP does not consider that the claimed 
indication for XELJANZ brings a significant clinical benefit over existing therapies based on improved 
safety compared to currently approved biologic agents.  
3.5.  Significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care 
Tofacitinib does have a novel mechanism of action and as such could be considered a treatment 
alternative to currently authorised products for ulcerative colitis, especially in those patients who have 
not responded to TNFi therapy.  
In contrast to the authorised biologic agents, which each engage a single molecular target, tofacitinib 
has a distinct mechanistic action, inhibiting JAK-dependent cytokines, that have been implicated in UC 
disease pathogenesis and re-establish homeostasis of T-cell signalling, including signalling pathway 
components predictive of disease severity and likely to mediate TNFi resistance. Genetic association 
studies have implicated the JAK/STAT pathway in UC, including loci containing the receptors for IL-2, 
IL-15, IL-12 and IL-23; the shared P40 subunit for IL 12 and IL-23; IL-10; IL-2 and IL-21; IL-13; 
Interferonγ (IFNγ), Oncostatin M (OSM); STATs and suppressors of cytokine signalling. Connecting 
these genetic associations to pathogenesis, infiltrating T cells are activated by IL 7 and IL-15 released 
from damaged epithelial cells and IL-2 and IL-21 can activate T cells in an autocrine manner.   
Dendritic cells and macrophages produce IL-12 and IL-23 leading to the differentiation of T cells to Th1 
cells which produce IFNγ and Th17 cells which produce IL-17a, IL-21 and IL-22.  Pre-clinical UC 
models and observations in humans suggest that the immune response may be skewed away from the 
TH2/IL-13 axis and toward increased TH1 or TH17 response in TNF non-responders.  Therefore, given 
the potential of the TH2/IL-13 axis to promote fibrosis, it may be best to dampen TH1, TH2, and TH17 
responses in unison by JAK inhibition so as to re-establish homeostasis without skewing the T cell 
response in either pathogenic direction.   Tofacitinib can inhibit differentiation to TH1, TH2, and TH17

subsets  and is efficacious in diseases where each of these subsets dominate (eg, TH1 in rheumatoid 
arthritis [RA], TH17 in psoriasis, and TH2 in atopic dermatitis).  
Beyond the concept that it may be useful to target multiple cytokines, high levels of the JAK-
dependent cytokine OSM at baseline in two Phase 3 trials of infliximab and golimumab were predictive 
of disease severity and likely mediate resistance to anti-TNFs.  The OSM receptor is expressed on non-
epithelial intestinal stromal cells and responds to OSM by producing IL-6, adhesion molecules and 
chemokines to attract neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells. Both OSM and IL-6 signalling are inhibited 
by tofacitinib and may explain the activity of tofacitinib in UC patients who have failed TNFi agents. 
Moreover, as a small molecule inhibitor, tofacitinib is less susceptible to formation of anti-drug 
antibodies that may account for decreasing efficacy of biologics with time. This may also account for its 
activity in patients who have experienced failure to TNFi agents and the consistent plasma tofacitinib 
concentrations over time. Thus, on a mechanistic level there is biological plausibility for efficacy of 
tofacitinib, particularly in relation to prior TNFi resistance/failure, relating to its effects on signalling 
pathways implicated in disease pathogenesis. 
The MAH has presented literature data regarding the response rates to TNFi therapy and indeed there 
are a significant number of patients who do fail to respond to this therapy and thus have limited 
treatment options; therefore, a therapy with a different mechanism of action may be considered a 
clinical benefit.   
The evidence for clinical benefit of tofacitinib in relation to currently authorised agents is discussed 
above (under “3.3. Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy). Considering the limitations 
of comparisons across studies, and the more stringent definitions of response in the tofacitinib 
programme, the data for tofacitinib compare favourably against approved biologic therapies. 
All currently approved therapies for moderately to severely active UC are administered either 
intravenously or subcutaneously, requiring repeated hospital admission and trained staff to administer 
and monitot the patients. The route of administration of these therapies and need for refrigeration for 
subcutaneous agents may be undesirable for many patients. As the bulk of disease burden occurs 
during the most productive years of a UC patient’s life and patient preference is an important 
consideration for treatment decision, the current availability of only intravenously or subcutaneously 
administered therapies represents an important limitation in treating UC. Therefore, the oral method of 
administration of Xeljanz may offer an advantage to some patients with regards to putative 
convenience and does introduce a patient choice and as such could be considered a significant clinical 
benefit. 
Data on compliance with oral therapy has been supplied by the MAH, reporting mean compliance of 
99.0% (range 50.9-101.6%) and 99.3% (range 71.1-102.4%) in the two induction studies and 
compliance of 99.1% (range 90.2-100.8%) and 98.8% (range 76.9-106.9%) for the 5mg BID and 
10mg BID dosing, respectively, in the maintenance study. The limitations of calculating compliance 
rates based upon patient records is acknowledged, although in this clinical trial setting the compliance 
rates are considered satisfactory. Compliance rates in the clinical trial setting were high, and the 
helpful day/night labelling of the product blister packs is considered helpful in reducing patient 
forgetfulness for this BID oral dosing product. 
MAH has provided a detailed discussion on factors relating to adherence to medication in patients with 
chronic conditions, including in UC, and a good justification of how tofacitinib can overcome several of 
these factors. In chronic diseases, common barriers to adherence to therapy are related to patients’ 
issues and beliefs.  The only significant barriers related to the medications are a high pill burden, 
beliefs about the medication and concerns about side effects. Tofacitinib offers a therapy with a low pill

burden and good tolerability. In addition, the expected response to therapy and more serious side 
effects are well described.   
Complexity of dosing regimens (large numbers of pills and/or beyond twice daily dosing) and/or the 
need for concomitant medications as well as side effects from these concomitant medications is 
associated with increased non-adherence.   Tofacitinib, as a medication proposed for treatment of UC 
for BID use and as an effective monotherapy allowing for the elimination of corticosteroids and non-
use of concomitant immunomodulators with their own associated unique side effects, may be able to 
address these factors contributing to poor adherence.   
Another factor cited as contributing to non-adherence was lack of knowledge about or belief in the 
efficacy of the medication.  In moderately to severely ill patients, prompt onset of therapeutic benefit 
may help to reassure patients that the medication prescribed will provide meaningful therapeutic 
benefit.  Given tofacitinib’s early onset of benefit for many patients, as demonstrated in the replicate 
induction studies by the first assessment of benefit by Week 2, it is likely that this rapid onset of 
meaningful benefit could encourage the large subset of patients who experience this rapid onset of 
benefit to adhere to their treatment regimen in order to accrue additional therapeutic benefit.  
Additionally, especially for those subjects who had prior failure to TNFi, the induction efficacy results 
showing that tofacitinib provides significant efficacy regardless of prior TNFi status might provide some 
confidence and reassurance to patients regarding tofacitinib’s efficacy in this difficult to treat patient 
population. 
An important finding from recent systematic reviews of adherence in treating immune-mediated 
inflammatory diseases including IBD in general is the central importance of psychological factors in 
patient adherence. Assessments of quality of life in patients with IBD have shown significant deficits, 
comparable to subjects with chronic kidney disease and cancer. The significant improvements provided 
by treatment with tofacitinib in both physical and emotional component measurements of quality of life 
by the SF-36 and IBDQ instruments, particularly with potential for rapid onset of clinical benefit 
discussed above, may mitigate the negative effect on treatment adherence noted for depression in 
patients with UC 
Having considered the data submitted by the MAH, the CHMP considers that the claimed indication for 
XELJANZ brings a significant clinical benefit over existing therapies based on a major contribution to 
patient care compared to currently approved biologic agents.  
4.  Conclusion 
With a novel mechanism of action compared to established products for moderate to severely active 
UC, and evidence of clinical efficacy in patients with prior failure on TNFi agents for whom few or no 
other medical options are available, together with a more convenient oral dosing presentation 
regarded to be of benefit to patients, it is considered that a significant clinical benefit is demonstrated 
on the following grounds:

1.  Introduction 
On  February  19,  2015,  the  MAH  submitted  an  English  summary  of  the  clinical  study  report  of  a 
completed Japanese study including one paediatric patient for Zometa, in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006  requires  that  any  marketing  authorisation  holder 
sponsored study which involves the use in the paediatric population of a medicinal product covered by 
a marketing authorization, whether or not they are conducted in compliance with an agreed paediatric 
investigation plan, is to be submitted to the competent authority. 
In  a  recent  review  of  the  requirements  of  the  Paediatric  Regulation,  Novartis  has  prepared 
aremediation action to ensure that all paediatric data is submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the 
Paediatric Regulation.  In this context and in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation we 
would  like  to  submit  the  data  of  a  paediatric  patient  included  in  study  CZOL446DJP01  which  was 
conducted  solely  in  Japan.  Study  CZOL446DJP01  is  a  Novartis-sponsored  Japanese  study  and  was 
conducted  for  purposes  of  providing  postmarketing  surveillance  data  in  Japanese  patients  to  comply 
with  post-marketing  reuirements.  One  patient  in  the  study  was  a  paediatric  patient  <  18  years.  The 
study is not linked to other paediatric studies which have been or will be the subject of other Article 46 
submissions. 
As  this  study  has  only  been  conducted  in  Japan  with  limited  contribution  of  paediatric  patients  a 
complete English translation of the clinical study report has not been submitted. 
Also, as only one paediatric patient was included in this post-marketing surveillance study, and that no 
AE was reported for this patient, only a summary of the clinical study report in English and a line listing 
including the single paediatric patient are provided in stead of short critical expert overview as critical 
analysis of the data for the paediatric patient is not warranted.

CZOL446DJP01, The MHLW (Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare) mandated drug use observational 
investigation of Zometa 
Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary  objective  is  to  confirm  the  safety  and  efficacy  for  Zometa(zoledronic  acid)  under  the  actual 
medical practice.  
Secondary objective is to confirm the efficacy of Zometa under the actual medical practice. 
Study design 
Japanese post marketing surveillance. The surveillance is required by the local regulation.  
Multiple institution, un-blind, no-control, multiple dose, all patient surveillance. 
Prior to the initiation of the surveillance, the contract for the surveillance is concluded between NPKK 
(Novartis  Pharma  KK)  and  the  medical  institution.  Drug  is  supplied  to  the  medical  institutions  after 
confirmation  of  the  contract  by  NPKK.  The  investigators  should  send  the  registration  form  for  the 
patients  prescribed  Zometa  to  the  central  enrollment  system  (CRO).  The  investigators  describe  the 
safety and efficacy data into the CRFs as soon as completion of observation period, and NPKK collects 
CRFs  from  the investigators. NPKK carries out the statistical analysis and  prepare  the  interim  report, 
and it is submitted to PMDA (One of health authority) annually. 
Study population /Sample size 
All Patients treated with Zometa for hypercalcemia due to malignant tumor 
Number of planned subjects: All patients (More than 1000 patients）  
Number of subjects registrated: 1111 patients  
Number of subjects for safety analysis: 1073 patients  
Number of subjects for efficacy analysis: 771 patients 
Study period 
From Oct 22nd, 2004 to Mar 22nd, 2007. (From approval date to after 2.5 years)

Results 
Safety results 
The incidence  of side effects in this use-result survey was 8.85%  (95/1073 patients),  and  was  lower 
compared to the incidence of side effects until the approval, 84.62% (22/26 patients). This is probably 
due  to  very  low  number  of  subjects  (26  patients)  in  the  clinical  study,  and  due  to  more  detailed 
findings  collected  as  adverse  events  through  Source  Data  Verification  (SDV)  by  clinical  research 
associates (field monitors), than in general practices.  
The  common  side  effects  by  System  Organ  Classes  and  incidence  were;  Metabolism  and  nutrition 
disorders  in  3.17%  (34/1073  patients),  Investigations  in  2.80%  (30/1073  patients),  and  General 
disorders and administration site conditions in 2.14% (23/1073 patients).  
Although  the  incidence  of  the  System  Organ  Classes  was  lower  compared  to  the  status  until  the 
approval, the trend of side effects was similar.  
Among side effects which are called for attention in the section (1) Clinically significant side effects of 
the package insert, no side effects were notably high in incidence compared to the occurrence until the 
approval.  
The side  effects  found in  this use-result survey  but not found  until the approval  were;  osteomyelitis, 
periodontitis,  pneumonia, 
coagulation, 
cancer  pain,  anaemia,  disseminated 
hypoalbuminaemia,  hypocalcaemia,  hypoproteinaemia,  decreased  appetite,  depression,  eating 
disorder,  optic  neuritis,  pericardial  effusion,  pleural  effusion,  diarrhoea,  rash,  arthralgia,  back  pain, 
pain  in  extremity,  pain  in  jaw,  renal  disorder,  renal  failure,  renal  impairment,  calcinosis,  chest  pain, 
malaise,  Albuminemia  in  blood,  blood  calcium  increase,  blood  creatinine  decreased,  blood  lactate 
dehydrogenase  increased,  blood  potassium  increased,  blood  sodium  increased,  blood  urea  increased, 
C-reactive  protein  increased,  thrombocytopenia,  weight  decreased,  and  leukopenia.  The  incidence  of 
the above side effects was all low (0.09% to 0.37%). While, the side effects found until the approval 
but not found in this use-result survey were: altered state of consciousness, hypoaesthesia, pulmonary 
oedema, blister, eczema, haematuria, polyuria, beta 2 microglobulin urine increased, blood potassium 
decreased,  blood  urine  present,  haemoglobin  decreased,  and  blood  phosphorus  decreased.  The  side 
effects  found  in  this  use-result  survey  which  are  listed  in  Precautions  were;  hypocalcaemia  (2.70%), 
and blood urea increased (1.12%, 12 cases).  
No  notable  issues  were  found  as  change  in  trend  of  side  effects or  common  incidence  of  side effects 
unexpected from Precautions. No remarkable issues were found as incidence of significant side effects 
listed in the package insert are commonly found, compared to the data to the approval.

In patients with renal impairment, no new findings requires attention, however, careful administration 
should be continued while observing their conditions especially in patients with serious renal disorder. 
No other issues were found in side effects in elderly patients or patients with hepatic function disorder 
(data were not collected for pediatric, pregnant or nursing patients). 
Efficacy results 
Investigated  771  patients  as  efficacy  analysis  set,  and  79.90%  of  patients  were  determined  by  the 
investigator  as  to  have  achieved  complete  response  of  corrected  serum  calcium  level.  This  was 
comparable  to  the  efficacy  in  84.0%  of  patients  determined  to  have  achieved  complete  response  of 
corrected serum calcium level in a Phase II study for approval in Japan (Study 1201) in patients with 
hypercalcemia of malignancy. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on clinical aspects 
1091 patients were enrolled in the surveillance.  
Main  side  effects  were  Hypocalcaemia  2.70%  (29  cases),  Blood  urea  increased  1.12%  (12  cases), 
Blood creatinine increased 1.03% (11 cases), and Pyrexia 1.77% (19 cases).  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Only one paediatric patient (age: 16 years, male) was included in the post-marketing surveillance 
study above. No AEs were reported for this patient. 
Thus the results from this study does not change the benefit-risk profile for paediatric patients  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Ilumetri is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
This medicinal product is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced 
in the diagnosis and treatment of plaque psoriasis.  
Posology 
The recommended dose is 100 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, and 4 and every 12 weeks 
thereafter.  
At the physician’s discretion, in patients with  high disease burden or in patients above 90 kg of body 
weight a dose of 200 mg may provide greater efficacy.

Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after 
28 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initial partial response may subsequently improve with 
continued treatment beyond 28 weeks.  
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, dosing should be 
resumed at the regular scheduled time.  
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).  
Renal or hepatic impairment  
Ilumetri has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. For 
further information on elimination of tildrakizumab, see section 5.2. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Ilumetri in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not yet 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
This medicinal product is administered by subcutaneous injection. Injection sites should be alternated. 
Ilumetri should not be injected into areas where the skin is affected by plaque psoriasis or is tender, 
bruised, red, hard, thick, or scaly. The syringe or the pen must not be shaken. Each syringe or pen is for 
single use only. 
After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Ilumetri if a physician 
determines that it is appropriate. However, the physician should ensure appropriate follow-up of patients. 
Patients should be instructed to inject the full amount of tildrakizumab according to the instructions 
provided in the package leaflet. Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package 
leaflet.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Clinically important active infection, e.g. active tuberculosis (see section 4.4). 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Infections 
Tildrakizumab has the potential to increase the risk of infection (see section 4.8). 
Caution should be exercised when considering the use of tildrakizumab in patients with a chronic infection 
or a history of recurrent or recent serious infection. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of a clinically 
relevant chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection, the patient should be 
closely monitored and tildrakizumab should not be administered until the infection resolves (see 
section 4.3). 
Pre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis  
Prior to initiating treatment, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients 
receiving tildrakizumab should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after 
treatment. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating treatment in patients with a past history 
of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. 
Hypersensitivity 
If a serious hypersensivity reaction occurs, administration of tildrakizumab should be discontinued 
immediately and appropriate therapy initiated (see section 4.3).  
Vaccinations 
Prior to initiating treatment with tildrakizumab, consider completion of all appropriate immunisations 
according to current immunisation guidelines. If a patient has received live viral or bacterial vaccination it 
is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with tildrakizumab. Patients treated 
with tildrakizumab should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for at least 17 weeks after 
treatment (see section 4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Vaccines 
No data are available on the response to live or inactivated vaccines. Live vaccines should not be given 
concurrently with tildrakizumab (see section 4.4). 
Interactions with cytochrome P450 
Concomitant medicinal products affecting tildrakizumab pharmacokinetics are not expected since it is 
cleared from the body by general protein catabolism processes with no contribution of cytochrome P450 
(CYP450) enzymes, and it is not eliminated by renal or hepatic pathways. Furthermore, tildrakizumab 
does not impact the pharmacokinetics of concomitant medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 
enzymes either through direct or indirect mechanisms (see section 5.2). 
Interactions with other immunosuppressive agents or phototherapy 
The safety and efficacy of tildrakizumab in combination with other immunosupressive agents, including 
biologics, or phototherapy has not been evaluated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential  
Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for 
at least 17 weeks after treatment.

Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of tildrakizumab 
in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effect with respect to 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
Ilumetri during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether tildrakizumab is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in 
cynomolgus monkey have shown negligible levels of Ilumetri in milk on postnatal day 28 (see 
section 5.3). In humans, during the first few days after birth antibodies may be transferred to the newborns 
through milk. In this short period, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be 
made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Ilumetri therapy taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
The effect of Ilumetri on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ilumetri has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reaction 
Immunogenicity 
In pooled Phase 2b and Phase 3 analyses, 7.3% of tildrakizumab-treated patients developed antibodies to 
tildrakizumab up to week 64. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to tildrakizumab, 38% (22/57 
patients) had neutralizing antibodies. This represents 2.8% of all subjects receiving tildrakizumab.  
In pooled phase 3 analyses, 8.3% of tildrakizumab-treated patients developed antibodies to tildrakizumab 
up to 420 weeks of treatment. Of the tildrakizumab-treated patients who developed antibodies to 
tildrakizumab, 35% (36/102 patients) had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing, which represents 
2.9% of all tildrakizumab-treated patients.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 10 mg/kg intravenously have been safely administered in clinical trials.  
In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of 
adverse reactions and that appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC17 
Mechanism of action 
Tildrakizumab is a humanised IgG1/k monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the p19 protein 
subunit of the interleukin-23 (IL-23) cytokine without binding to IL-12 and inhibits its interaction with the 
IL-23 receptor. 
IL-23 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. 
Tildrakizumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
The multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 
studies enrolled a total of 1,862 patients 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis who had a 
minimum body surface area involvement of 10%, a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of ≥ 3 in 
the overall assessment (plaque thickness, erythema, and scaling) of psoriasis on a severity scale of 0 to 5, a 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≥ 12, and who were candidates for phototherapy or 
systemic therapy. 
In these studies, patients were randomised to either placebo or tildrakizumab (including 200 mg and 
100 mg at 0, 4 and every twelve weeks thereafter [Q12W]), up to 52 or 64 weeks. In the active comparator 
study (reSURFACE 2), patients were also randomised to receive etanercept 50 mg twice weekly for 
12 weeks, and weekly thereafter up to 28 weeks.  
Overall demographic and baseline characteristics in reSURFACE1 and reSURFACE2 studies were 
consistent across individual trials. Patients were 18 to 82 years old, with a mean age of 45.9 years old. The 
median baseline PASI score ranged from 17.7 to 18.4 across treatment groups. Baseline PGA score was 
marked or severe in 33.4% of patients. Of all patients, 35.8% had received prior phototherapy, 41.1% had 
received prior conventional systemic therapy, 16.7% had received prior biologic therapy for the treatment 
of plaque psoriasis. A total of 15.4% of study patients had a history of psoriatic arthritis. Mean baseline 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) ranged from 13.0 to 14.8. 
Studies reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 assessed the changes from baseline at Week 12 in the two co-
primary endpoints: 1) PASI 75 and 2) PGA of “0” (cleared) or “1” (minimal), with at least a 2-point 
improvement from baseline. Other evaluated outcomes included the proportion of patients who achieved 
PASI 90, PASI 100, the proportion of patients with DLQI 0 or 1, and maintenance of efficacy up to 
52/64 weeks.  
Results obtained at weeks 12, 28 and beyond (up to week 64 in reSURFACE 1 and up to week 52 in 
reSURFACE 2) are presented in Table 2 and Table 3.

Patients randomised to tildrakizumab 100 mg or tildrakizumab 200 mg in Part 1 who were PASI 75 responders at week 28 
(reSURFACE1). 
*No imputation of missing data. 
**These patients were switched to placebo at week 28. 
Quality of life/patient-reported outcomes 
At week 12 and across studies, tildrakizumab was associated with statistically significant improvement in 
health-related quality of life as assessed by the DLQI (Table 2). Improvements were maintained over time 
with at week 52, 63.7% (100 mg) and 73.3% (200 mg) in reSURFACE 1, and 68.8% (100 mg) and 72.4% 
(200 mg) in reSURFACE 2 of patients who were PASI 75 responders at week 28 having a DLQI of 0 or 1.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Ilumetri 
in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of plaque psoriasis (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).

5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The subcutaneous formulation of tildrakizumab showed an absolute bioavailability ranging from 73% 
(90% CI: 46% - 115%, 200 mg subcutaneous vs. 3 mg/kg intravenous) to 80% (90% CI: 62% - 103%, 
50 mg subcutaneous vs. 0.5 mg/kg intravenous) in healthy subjects, as a result of cross study single dose 
comparison. Maximum concentration was reached at 6.2 days after injection. Population pharmacokinetic 
analysis indicated a 31% higher bioavailability in healthy subjects compared to patients. 
At steady state, following administration of 100 mg of tildrakizumab in subjects with moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis geometric means (% coefficient of variation [%CV]) of AUC0-τ and Cmax values were 
respectively 305 μg·day/mL (41%) and 8.1 μg/mL (34%), whereas they were 612 μg·day/mL (40%) and 
16.3 μg/mL (33%) following administration of 200 mg.  
Distribution 
Tildrakizumab has limited extravascular distribution with volume of distribution (Vd) values ranging from 
76.9 to 106 mL/kg. 
Biotransformation 
Tildrakizumab is catabolised into component amino acids by general protein degradation processes. 
Small-molecule metabolic pathways (e.g., CYP450 enzymes, glucuronosyltransferases) do not contribute 
to its clearance. 
Elimination 
Clearance values range from 2.04 to 2.52 mL/day/kg and the half-life was 23.4 days (23% CV) in subjects 
with plaque psoriasis.  
Linearity/non-linearity 
Tildrakizumab exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in subjects with plaque psoriasis over a dose 
range from 50 mg to 400 mg following subcutaneous administration, with clearance being independent of 
dose. 
Steady-state is achieved by 16 weeks with the clinical regimen of 0, 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter, with 
1.1-fold accumulation in exposure between week-1 and week-12 independent of dose. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Elderly 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age did not have a clinically significant influence on 
the clearance of tildrakizumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following administration of 100 mg 
or 200 mg of tildrakizumab, subjects who are 65 years or older (n=81 and n=82, respectively) had a 
similar tildrakizumab clearance as compared to subjects less than 65 years old (n=884). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No formal trial of the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tildrakizumab was 
conducted. Tildrakizumab is catabolised into component amino acids by general protein degradation 
processes and is not eliminated by renal or hepatic pathways.  
Body weight 
Population pharmacokinetic modelling indicated that exposure decreased as body weight increased. The 
geometric mean exposure (AUC0-τ at steady state) in adult patients weighing > 90 kg following a 100 mg 
or 200 mg subcutaneous dose was predicted to be about 30% lower than in an adult patient weighing 
≤90 kg (see section 4.2).  
Drug interactions 
Results from a drug-drug interaction study conducted in plaque psoriasis subjects suggest that 
tildrakizumab had no clinically relevant effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. 
Therefore, tildrakizumab does not impact the pharmacokinetics of concomitant medicinal products 
metabolised by CYP enzyme (see section 4.5). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, and repeated dose toxicity. 
Animal mutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with tildrakizumab. Studies in 
mouse tumor models showed that selective inhibition of IL-23p19 does not increase carcinogenic risk. 
In cynomolgus monkeys, there was negligible secretion of the product into breast milk. One month after 
birth, the milk/serum ratio was ≤ 0.002. Tildrakizumab was shown to distribute across the placental 
barrier. After repeated dosing to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, serum concentrations were quantifiable 
in the fetus, but the reproduction toxicity studies did not reveal any untoward effects. 
No effects on fertility parameters such as reproductive organs, menstrual cycle length, and/or hormones 
were observed in male and female cynomolgus monkeys that were administered tildrakizumab at doses 
resulting in > 100 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose based on AUC. 
In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study in monkeys, no related increase in pregnancy loss was 
observed at exposures up to 85 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. No harmful effects 
were noted in neonates at maternal exposures up to 9 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. 
Two neonatal deaths from monkeys administered tildrakizumab at maternal exposure of 85 times the 
human exposure at the recommended dose were attributed to possible viral infection and considered of 
uncertain relationship to the treatment. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. What Ilumetri is and what it is used for 
Ilumetri contains the active substance tildrakizumab. Tildrakizumab belongs to a group of medicines 
called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. 
This medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-23, a substance found in the body 
which is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses and which is present at increased levels 
in diseases such as psoriasis. 
Ilumetri is used to treat a skin condition called plaque psoriasis, in adults with moderate to severe disease.  
Using Ilumetri will benefit you by improvements of skin clearance and reducing your symptoms. 
2. What you need to know before you use Ilumetri 
Do not use Ilumetri: 
- 
- 
If you are allergic to tildrakizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you have an infection which your doctor thinks is important, for example, active tuberculosis 
which is an infectious disease affecting mainly the lungs. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ilumetri: 
- 
- 
- 
If you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, swelling of 
the face, lips or throat do not inject more Ilumetri and contact your doctor immediately. 
If you currently have an infection or if you have long-term or repeated infections. 
If you have recently had or plan to have a vaccination.  
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using 
Ilumetri. 
Look out for infections and allergic reactions 
Ilumetri can potentially cause serious side effects, including infections and allergic reactions. You must 
look out for signs of these conditions while you are taking Ilumetri. 
Stop using Ilumetri and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs 
indicating a possible serious infection or an allergic reaction (see section 4. Possible side effects).  
Children and adolescents 
Ilumetri is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because it 
has not yet been evaluated in this group of patients. 
Other medicines and Ilumetri  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
These include vaccines and immunosuppressants (medicines that affect the immune system). 
You should not be given certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) while using Ilumetri. No data are 
available with the concomitant use of Ilumetri and live vaccines. 
Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility 
It is preferable to avoid the use of Ilumetri in pregnancy. The effects of this medicine in pregnant women 
are not known. 
If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use an 
effective method of contraception whilst having treatment with Ilumetri and for at least 17 weeks after 
treatment. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  
Driving and using machines 
Ilumetri has no or little effect on the ability to drive and use machines. 
3. How to use Ilumetri 
Ilumetri is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the diagnosis 
and treatment of psoriasis. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. This medicine is for single use only. 
The recommended dose of Ilumetri is 100 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, and 4 and every 
12 weeks thereafter.  
If you are a patient with high disease burden or with a body weight above 90 kg, your doctor may decide 
that a dose of 200 mg is recommended for you.  
Your doctor will decide for how long you need to take Ilumetri. 
After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, you may inject Ilumetri yourself if your doctor 
determines that it is appropriate. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For instructions on how to inject Ilumetri yourself, see ‘Instructions for use’ at the end of this leaflet. 
Talk to your doctor about when you will have your injections and follow-up appointments. 
Use in children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy of Ilumetri in children and adolescents under 18 years of age has not yet been 
established and therefore Ilumetri is not recommended for use in children or adolescents. 
If you use more Ilumetri than you should 
If you have administered more Ilumetri than you should or the dose has been administered sooner than 
according to your doctor’s prescription, tell your doctor. 
If you forget to use Ilumetri 
If you have forgotten or missed an Ilumetri injection, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, 
resume dosing at the regularly scheduled interval. 
If you stop using Ilumetri 
The decision to stop using Ilumetri should be discussed with your doctor. Your symptoms may return 
upon discontinuation.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

1. What Ilumetri is and what it is used for 
Ilumetri contains the active substance tildrakizumab. Tildrakizumab belongs to a group of medicines 
called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. 
This medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-23, a substance found in the body 
which is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses and which is present at increased levels 
in diseases such as psoriasis. 
Ilumetri is used to treat a skin condition called plaque psoriasis, in adults with moderate to severe disease.  
Using Ilumetri will benefit you by improvements of skin clearance and reducing your symptoms. 
2. What you need to know before you use Ilumetri 
Do not use Ilumetri: 
- 
- 
If you are allergic to tildrakizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you have an infection which your doctor thinks is important, for example, active tuberculosis 
which is an infectious disease affecting mainly the lungs. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ilumetri: 
- 
- 
- 
If you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, swelling of 
the face, lips or throat do not inject more Ilumetri and contact your doctor immediately.

If you have recently had or plan to have a vaccination.

look out for signs of these conditions while you are taking Ilumetri. 
Stop using Ilumetri and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs 
indicating a possible serious infection or an allergic reaction (see section 4. Possible side effects).  
Children and adolescents 
Ilumetri is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because it 
has not yet been evaluated in this group of patients. 
Other medicines and Ilumetri  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
These include vaccines and immunosuppressants (medicines that affect the immune system). 
You should not be given certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) while using Ilumetri. No data are 
available with the concomitant use of Ilumetri and live vaccines. 
Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility 
It is preferable to avoid the use of Ilumetri in pregnancy. The effects of this medicine in pregnant women 
are not known. 
If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use an 
effective method of contraception whilst having treatment with Ilumetri and for at least 17 weeks after 
treatment. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  
Driving and using machines 
Ilumetri has no or little effect on the ability to drive and use machines.

you are not sure. This medicine is for single use only. 
The recommended dose of Ilumetri is 100 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, and 4 and every 
12 weeks thereafter.  
If you are a patient with high disease burden or with a body weight above 90 kg, your doctor may decide 
that a dose of 200 mg is recommended for you.  
Your doctor will decide for how long you need to take Ilumetri. 
After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, you may inject Ilumetri yourself if your doctor 
determines that it is appropriate. 
40

Step 2: Inject 
2A Remove Needle Cap 
•  Remove the gray needle cap from the pre-
filled pen by pulling it straight off (see 
Figure K). 
It may take some force to remove the cap.  
• 
DO NOT touch the yellow needle guard.

•  You will hear the 1st “Click” that lets you know the injection has started (see Figure M). 
•  A 2nd‚ “Click” lets you know the injection is almost complete (see Figure N). Hold the pre-filled 
pen for a total of 15 seconds after the injection has started to make sure that all the medicine has 
been injected. Count slowly to fifteen seconds an ensure the second “click” has been heard.  
•  Check the viewing window. The color of the viewing window will be filled yellow.  
•  Lift the pre-filled pen straight up from the skin (see Figure O).

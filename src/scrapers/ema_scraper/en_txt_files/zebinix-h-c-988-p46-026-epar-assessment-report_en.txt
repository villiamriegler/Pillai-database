1.  Introduction 
Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL; BIA 2-093, Zebinix®) was developed by BIAL-Portela & Cª., S.A. (BIAL) 
as an antiepileptic drug (AED). ESL is authorized as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset 
seizures (POS), with or without secondary generalisation, in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy and 
as adjunctive therapy in adults, adolescents and children aged above 6 years, with POS with or without 
secondary generalisation. The clinical development of ESL for monotherapy in the paediatric population 
as well as adjunctive therapy is ongoing. 
Zebinix® is approved as immediate release tablets containing 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg of ESL and 
as an oral suspension (50 mg/mL). 
Pursuant to Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 as amended, BIAL submitted to the EMA on 
22 September 2014 an application for modification of the agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP) 
with a deferral and a waiver as set out in the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA)decision P/213/2011 
issued on 2 September 2011, the decision P/0058/2012 issued on 26 March 2012, the decision 
P/0284/2012 issued on 23 November 2012 and the decision P/0197/2013 issued on 2 September 2013 
and the decision P/0015/2015 issued on 30 January 2015. The last modification of the PIP (EMEA-
000696-PIP02-10-M06) submitted on 21 March 2019 was approved by EMA decision P/0272/2019 on 
14 August 2019. 
With this post-authorisation measure (PAM) BIAL - Portela & Cª S.A. (Bial) is hereby submitting final 
study results and report related to paediatric population in line with Article 46 of paediatric regulation 
1901/2006 for Study BIA-2093-211. Study BIA-2093-211 is an open-label, 2-dose level trial to 
evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) as adjunctive 
therapy in infants with refractory epilepsy with partial-onset seizures aged from 1 month to <2 years. 
Study BIA-2093-211 was conducted with the aim of evaluating, as a primary objective, the PK profile 
of ESL in children, and as secondary objectives, to assess the safety of the ESL doses used in these 
infants, and to make exploratory analyses of efficacy. 
All patients have now completed the trial with the last ongoing patient completing the study on 03 April 
2020. The CSR is dated 11 September 2020. The due date for the submission of this study is 3 October 
2020 (i.e. 6 months from the completion of study). This study is part of the eslicarbazepine acetate 
PIP. A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study BIA-2093-211, an open-label, 2-dose level trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, 
and tolerability of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) as adjunctive therapy in infants with refractory 
epilepsy with partial-onset seizures aged from 1 month to <2 years. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
This is a Phase II, multinational, open-label study to evaluate up to 4 doses of ESL in infants 
(≥1 month to <2 years of age) with refractory partial-onset seizures (POS). Subjects were stratified 
and assigned to different dose groups based on their age (Age cohort A: ≥1 to <6 months; Age cohort 
B: ≥6 to <24 months). Up to 24 subjects will be enrolled at an estimated 22 centres in approximately 
12 to 13 countries in Europe (including Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Russia, 
Serbia, and Ukraine). Other countries may be added as needed. 
ESL was given for 5 days in Group 1 Age cohort A, for 10 days in Group 1 Age cohort B, and for 15 
days in Group 2 Age cohorts A and B. The study design is presented in Figure 1 below.

Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary: To evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ESL. 
Secondary: To assess the safety and tolerability of ESL in the defined patient population at the doses 
used and to perform exploratory analyses of efficacy. 
Study design 
The design chosen for this study is considered the most appropriate to evaluate the PK profile and 
safety of ESL as adjunctive treatment for refractory epilepsy in infants. Because the PK profile in 
children may vary with age, it is essential to collect sufficient information on the PK of ESL in children. 
The study follows current regulatory guidelines with regards to the study design, age group, sample 
size, the need to minimise distress, and the scientific data required before testing in infants. Safety 
data from previous children and adult human exposure are available, as well as repeat-dose studies, 
reproductive toxicity studies, and the standard battery of genotoxicity tests. More detailed information 
on safety results is presented in the clinical Investigator’s Brochure 
Study population / Sample size 
The study plans to include at least 16 subjects and possibly up to 24 subjects. Subjects will be enrolled 
in 22 centres in approximately 12 to 13 countries in Europe (including Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy, 
Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine). 
According to a draft guidance issued by the FDA, the standard PK approach is also appropriate for 
paediatric PK evaluation. This involves administering a drug to relatively small groups of subjects. The 
guidance mentions 6 to 12 subjects as an example of an appropriate sample size. 
Based on this recommendation, this study may have up to 24 evaluable subjects, to provide a 
sufficient sample size to adequately assess the PK in 2 age categories: 
Up to 16 evaluable subjects in total for the doses in Group 1: 
-  8 subjects ≥1 month to <6 months of age (Age cohort A). 
-  8 subjects ≥6 months to <24 months of age (Age cohort B). 
Up to 8 evaluable subjects in total for the doses in Group 2 (only if applicable): 
-  4 subjects ≥1 month to <6 months of age (Age cohort A). 
-  4 subjects ≥6 months to <24 months of age (Age cohort B). 
A preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed for each age cohort after at least four 
patients have completed the PK sampling in the respective cohort. More patients might be included in 
this analysis if available. If the starting dose is deemed to be the optimal dose based on the 
preliminary PK analysis, recruitment of subjects for Group 1 will be completed as planned and no 
subjects will be recruited for Group 2.  
If the PK data collected in Group 1 indicates that exposure may not be optimal at that dose, a second 
dose will be evaluated in Group 2. The maximum dose allowed for the adapted evaluation dose is 
20 mg/kg/day for Age cohort A and 30 mg/kg/day for Age cohort B. This was determined based on the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/42324/2021

outcome of a population PK analysis. In addition, ongoing patients in BIA-2093-211/EXT can be treated 
with the optimal dose according to results of the preliminary PK analysis and do not have to wait until 
the other cohort has recruited sufficient patients. The present study design thus complies with the 
available recommendations. 
Treatments 
Up to 4 doses of ESL will be given in this study: all subjects in both Age cohorts in Group 1 will begin 
treatment at 5 mg/kg/day and in Age cohort B, this will be used as a titration dose and will be 
increased to 10 mg/kg/day for the Evaluation Period (Table 1). If Group 2 is needed to further 
optimise the dose, subjects will begin on 5 mg/kg/day and then increase to potentially 2 evaluation 
doses of up to 20 mg/kg/day in Age cohort A and 30 mg/kg/day in Age cohort B. For all subjects that 
have an Up-titration Period, there will be a Downtitration Period beginning on Day 6 if they do not 
continue in the extension study. During the Titration/Evaluation Periods, each dose of the ESL is to be 
administered once daily in the morning by study staff to ensure full intake of the dose. If the infant 
vomits during the first 30 minutes after dosing, the dose is to be administered again. Treatment with 
ESL in this study will be given for 5 days in Group 1, Age cohort A; for up to 15 days in Group 1, Age 
cohort B, and Group 2, Age cohort A; and for up to 25 days in Group 2, Age cohort B (if a second Up-
titration Period is needed). 
Table 1 –Doses of ESL to be used in each group 
The starting dose of ESL was selected on the basis of data collected from a group of adult subjects 
participating in an open-label extension trial of Phase III add-on studies, who underwent frequent 
blood sampling during a dosing interval at steady state, and a previous add-on Phase II multiple-dose 
study performed in children between 2 and 17 years, which determined the following: 
• In the Phase III add-on studies in adult subjects, the effective doses were 800 mg and 1200 mg QD 
(corresponding to an average of approximately 20 mg/kg/day in children). 
• In the Phase II add-on study in children, CL/F of the active metabolite BIA 2-194 was faster in 
younger children, when normalised by body weight.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Demography and Baseline Characteristics: 
For a total of 23 of 24 enrolled subjects, 8 in age cohort A and 15 in age cohort B, ESL concentration 
data were received and all 23 subjects were included in the PK analysis: 4 in Group 1 Age cohort A, 10 
in Group 1 Age cohort B, 4 in Group 2 Age cohort A, and 5 in Group 2 Age cohort B. No subjects 
discontinued from the study. All 23 subjects completed the study and continued in the 1-year 
extension study. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics within each age cohort were balanced across the 2 treatment groups. For Age 
cohort A, mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 3.8 (0.50) months in Group 1 and 3.8 (1.50) 
months in Group 2. For Age cohort B, mean (SD) age was 14.7 (6.75) months in Group 1 and 16.2 
(5.81) months in Group 2. All subjects were Caucasian, 12 (52.2%) were male and 11 (47.8%) 
female. The mean (SD) height, body weight and head circumference were 71.7 (9.7) cm, 8.2 (2.1) kg 
and 42.3 (3.8) cm), respectively. Treatment groups were also balanced in terms of epilepsy history 
and baseline disease characteristics, apart from a higher frequency of complex partial seizures prior to 
study entry in Group 2 Age cohort B. The median (range) number of complex partial seizures was 15.0 
(0 to 121) in Group 1 Age cohort A, 0.0 (0 to 205) in Group 1 Age cohort B, 3.5 (0 to 41) in Group 2 
Age cohort A, and 90 (0 to 900) in Group 2 Age cohort B. 
Exposure: 
The mean treatment duration during the Evaluation Period was consistent across treatment groups: 
5.0 days in Group 1 Age cohort A, 5.0 days in Group 1 Age cohort B, 5.0 days in Group 2 Age cohort A, 
and 4.8 days in Group 2 Age cohort B. As expected by study design, the total mean treatment duration 
was 5.0 days in Group 1 Age cohort A, 10.0 days in Group 1 Age cohort B, 15.0 days in Group 2 Age 
cohort A, and 14.8 days in Group 2 Age cohort B. The mean daily doses and dose regimen received in 
the Evaluation Period were in accordance with the planned evaluation doses for each treatment group 
(Table 3).

Table 3 Mean Daily Dose (mg/kg) – Safety Set 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy data were analysed in an exploratory manner based on the Safety set.  
A slight increase from baseline in the proportion of seizure-free subjects in the Evaluation Period was 
observed in Group 2 Age cohort A (0% to 25%) and in Group 1 Age cohort B (10% to 30%) while the 
proportion was maintained in Group 1 Age cohort A (25% to 25%) and Group 2 Age cohort B (20% to 
20%). 
The mean relative change from baseline in standardised seizure frequency was higher at 20 mg/kg 
than at the lower dose: -37.35% and -75.74% in Groups 1 and 2 of Age cohort A, and -8.67% and -
30.38% in Groups 1 and 2 of Age cohort B, respectively. 
The proportion of subjects with a relevant reduction from baseline (≥50%) in standardised seizure 
frequency in Age cohort A was higher at 20 mg/kg (50% had a 50% to 75% reduction and 50% had a 
> 75% reduction) than at 5 mg/kg (25% had a >75% reduction). In Age cohort B, there was no 
indication of a dose response relationship with ESL in the proportion of subjects with a relevant 
reduction from baseline in standardised seizure frequency (Table 4).

Table 4 Categorised Relative Change from Baseline in Standardised Seizure Frequency by 
Study Period – Safety Set 
At the 20 mg/kg dose, a relevant reduction from baseline in standardised seizure frequency appeared 
to occur more frequently in male than in female subjects. All male subjects in Group 2 (3 in Age cohort 
A and 2 in Age cohort B) had a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline compared with 1 of 4 female subjects in 
Group 2 (1 of 1 subject in Age cohort A and none of 3 subjects in Age cohort B). 
Overall, efficacy results for Group 2 were in general higher than for Group 1 that was initiated at the 
lower dose of 5 mg/kg QD in Age cohort A and 10 mg/kg QD in Age cohort B; however, the interim 
analysis results indicated that these starting doses were not optimal in either age cohort. 
Therefore, Group 2 was included in the study, in which subjects were treated at 20 mg/kg QD in both 
age cohorts. In addition, the subjects from Group 1 who continued in the 1-year extension study could 
receive a dose increment of up to 20 mg/kg QD at the discretion of the Investigator after completion of 
the 6-day Evaluation Period. 
Seizure Frequency by Seizure Type 
The most common seizure type reported during the study was complex partial, followed by partial 
evolving to secondarily generalised, simple partial, and unclassifiable. No subjects experienced 
generalised or other seizure types. Noteworthy changes from baseline in standardised seizure 
frequency were primarily observed for complex partial seizures and partial evolving to secondarily

generalised seizures, which were also the most frequent seizure types reported during the study and 
which reflected an overall pattern of improvement (i.e. reduction in standardised seizure frequency). 
The mean relative change from baseline in standardised seizure frequency of complex partial seizures 
in both age cohorts showed a clear reduction at the 20 mg/kg dose compared with the lower dose  
(-8.96% and -82.25% in Groups 1 and 2 of Age cohort A, and 42.66% and -35.69% in Groups 1 and 2 
of Age cohort B, respectively). A reduction from baseline in standardised seizure frequency was also 
observed for partial seizures evolving to secondarily generalised but there was no indication of a dose 
relationship with ESL (mean relative change from Baseline: -76.67% and -69.23% in Groups 1 and 2 
of Age cohort A and -74.67% and -14.44% in Groups 1 and 2 of Age cohort B, respectively). 
Simple partial seizures were only reported in Group 1, in both age cohorts. Only 2 subjects had 
available data in the Evaluation Period: a reduction from baseline of -15.85% was observed in 1 
subject in Group 1 Age cohort A, and an increase from baseline of 50.0% was observed in 1 subject in 
Group 1 Age cohort B. 
Unclassifiable seizures were only reported in Group 2 Age cohort A, and only 1 subject had available 
data in the Evaluation Period: this subject had no unclassifiable seizures during the Evaluation Period 
(100% reduction from baseline). 
Pharmacokinetic Results: 
Using the bioequivalence module of the Phoenix WinNonlin program, geometric mean ratios (age 
cohort B/age cohort A) for Cmax and AUCτ and their 90% confidence interval were calculated. Hence, 
geometric mean ratios for Cmax and AUCτ were calculated with age cohort A as reference. 
A high inter-individual variability was found in the pharmacokinetics of ESL in both age cohort A (≥1 to 
< 6 months) and age cohort B (≥6 to <24 months) at the dose levels tested. Values for tmax and t1/2 
were similar in both age cohorts and were not affected by dose. Median tmax varied from 1.50 to 2.25 
hours, whereas the elimination phase, which appeared to be monophasic, was characterised by a 
geometric mean apparent t1/2 that varied between 6.36 and 7.37 hours. 
With increasing dose, the exposure to ESL, as based on both Cmax and AUCτ, increased. This increase 
appeared dose proportional in age cohort B whereas in age cohort A the increase appeared less than 
dose proportional. At a dose of 20 mg/kg, the geometric mean ratio (90% CI) was 2.12 (1.33; 3.37) 
for Cmax and 2.25 (1.30; 3.91) for AUCτ, indicating higher exposure to ESL in Age cohort B than in Age 
cohort A. No apparent effect of gender on the PK of ESL was found in these age groups. Descriptive 
statistics of PK parameters by age cohort and dose are presented in the following Table 5.

Safety results 
The relevance of any observed differences in safety results must be considered in the context of the 
small sample size, different ESL treatment durations between the groups, and lack of placebo control. 
Overall, 6 subjects (26.1%) experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study: 1 subject (25%) in Group 1 
Age cohort A, 3 (30%) in Group 1 Age cohort B, 2 (50%) in Group 2 Age cohort A, and none in Group 
2 Age cohort B. All TEAEs were assessed as mild except for 1 TEAE of moderate intensity reported in 
Group 1 Age cohort B. No subjects experienced a TEAE leading to death, a serious TEAE, a TEAE 
leading to discontinuation of study drug, or an adverse event of special interest. There were no 
clinically relevant differences between the treatment groups in the incidence of TEAEs by system organ

class (SOC) and preferred term, and there was no relationship with age or increasing dose. The overall 
pattern of TEAEs reflected the known safety profile of ESL.  
Overall, the most common SOCs in which TEAEs were reported were nervous system disorders 
(13.0%), gastrointestinal disorders (8.7%), and investigations (8.7%). The most common TEAE was 
somnolence, reported by 2 subjects (20%) in Group 1 Age cohort B, 1 subject (25%) in Group 2 Age 
cohort A, and no subjects in both Group 1 Age cohort A and Group 2 Age cohort B. All other TEAEs 
were each reported in 1 subject overall. The most common treatment-related TEAE was somnolence, 
reported by 2 subjects (20%) in Group 1 Age cohort B and 1 subject (25%) in Group 2 Age cohort A.  
There were no clinically meaningful changes over time or differences between treatment groups in 
haematology, biochemistry, or urinalysis parameters. Overall, 1 subject (Group 2 Age cohort A) had 
clinically significant low sodium values on Day 2 (Visit 3) and Day 6 of the Evaluation Period, which 
was reported as a mild TEAE of hyponatraemia that was assessed by the investigator as related to the 
study drug. 
ESL at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg QD does not cause a clinically relevant prolongation of the QTc 
interval in infants with refractory epilepsy with partial-onset seizures aged from 1 month to <2 years. 
The mean absolute change from baseline in QT interval corrected for heart rate using Bazett’s formula 
(QTcB) values ranged between -9.2 and 1.5 milliseconds (ms) in the 4 treatment groups, which were 
not clinically relevant. The mean absolute change from baseline in QT interval corrected for heart rate 
using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) values ranged between -6.2 and 0.3 ms in the different treatment 
groups, which were not clinically relevant. Categorical observations for QTcB and QTcF values were 
reviewed and quantified according to the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products 
(CPMP/ICH/2711/99) and International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use E14 guidelines. No subjects had absolute or change from baseline 
values in the pre-specified categories for QTcB and QTcF.  
No clinically significant changes were observed in heart rate (HR), PR interval, or QRS duration in any 
dose group on by-time-point analysis. No subjects had treatment-emergent arrhythmias that would 
suggest a potential pro-arrhythmic effect. All these findings suggest that ESL at doses of 5, 10 and 20 
mg/kg QD does not cause a clinically relevant prolongation of the QTc interval in infants with refractory 
epilepsy with partial-onset seizures aged from 1 month to <2 years. 
No clinically meaningful changes over time or differences between treatment groups were observed in 
ECG findings as evaluated by the investigator. One subject in Group 1 Age cohort B had a clinically 
relevant abnormal ECG (prolongation of the PR interval, 173 ms; normal range for gender and age: PR 
interval ≤ 147 ms) at EOT, which was reported as a mild TEAE of ECG PR prolongation that was 
assessed by the investigator as related to the study drug. 
No clinically meaningful changes over time or differences between treatment groups were observed in 
vital sign parameters and physical and neurological examinations. No deaths occurred during the 
study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the PK profile of ESL in infants at different doses, to 
assess the safety of ESL in these infants, and to make exploratory analyses of efficacy. The design 
chosen for this study is considered appropriate to evaluate the PK profile and safety of ESL as 
adjunctive treatment for refractory epilepsy in infants. Because the PK profile in children may vary with 
age, it is essential to collect sufficient information on the PK of ESL in children.

Overall, a high inter-individual variability was found in the PK of ESL both in age cohort A (≥ 1 to 
< 6 months) and B (≥ 6 to <24 months) at the dose levels tested. Values for tmax and t1/2 were similar 
in both age cohorts. At a dose of 20 mg/kg, the geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) for 
Cmax and AUCτ were 2.12 (1.33, 3.37) and 2.25 (1.30, 3.91), respectively, indicating higher exposure 
to ESL in cohort B (older infants) when compared to cohort A. Geometric mean ratios for Cmax and 
AUCτ were calculated with age cohort A as reference as described more detailed further above 
(pharmacokinetic results). 
Regarding the proportion of subjects with a relevant reduction from baseline (≥ 50%) in standardised 
seizure frequency in Age cohort A, the reduction in standardized seizure frequency was higher at 
20 mg/kg than at 5 mg/kg. In Age cohort B (older patients), there was no indication of a dose 
response relationship with ESL in the proportion of subjects with a relevant reduction from baseline in 
standardised seizure frequency. Moreover, at the 20 mg/kg dose a relevant reduction from baseline in 
standardised seizure frequency appeared to occur more frequently in male than in female subjects. 
Inter- and intra-individual variability in the PK characteristics of ESL and reduction in seizure frequency 
depend on both age-related and genetic factors (gender) in infants which should be considered in the 
process of finding an appropriate dosing schedule.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In this study all children received ESL oral suspension (50 mg/ml) as test medication in addition to 
their current treatment with one or two anti-epileptic medications. The daily dose of the children was 
chosen depending on age, body weight and the allocated treatment group. Starting dose was 5 mg/kg 
for all infants. The adapted target dose was determined based on the pharmacokinetic analyses of 
group 1 and should not exceed 20 mg/kg/day in age cohort A (younger infants) and 30 mg/kg/d in age 
cohort B (older infants) with a maximal duration of 15 or 25 days respectively including up- and down 
titration. 
Due to the small sample size, different ESL treatment durations between the groups, and lack of 
placebo control a definite conclusion cannot be drawn regarding the optimal ESL dose based on the 
totality of PK, safety, and efficacy data from this open-label phase 2 study.  
The study does not yield any new efficacy aspects of ESL in children. There were no new safety signals 
observed, and the safety profile reflected the known safety profile for ESL. The applicant does not 
propose any amendment of the product information.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The currently approved indication is TAKHZYRO is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of 
hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older. 
The proposed new indication is TAKHZYRO is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of 
hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 2 years and older. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by unpredictable recurrent 
episodes of subcutaneous or submucosal oedema typically affecting the skin, upper airway, and 
gastrointestinal tract.  
The estimated prevalence of HAE in the general population is one individual per 50,000, with reported ranges 
from 1:10,000 to 1:150,000 (Ghazi A, Grant JA. Biologics. 2013;7:103-13). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Hereditary angioedema is caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene coding for C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-
INH), resulting in deficiency (HAE type I) or dysfunction (HAE type II) of C1-INH protein. 
C1-INH is the major serine protease inhibitor of the early complement proteases as well as the contact 
system proteases, plasma kallikrein and coagulation factor XIIa. Deficiency of C1-INH within the kallikrein-
kinin (contact system) is believed to result in the loss of inhibition of plasma kallikrein (pKal) activity leading 
to the increased bradykinin release from high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) and vascular leak 
mediated by bradykinin binding to the B2 receptor (B2-R) on the surface of endothelial cells. 
Assessment report 
EMA/440820/2023 
Page 8/64 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Acute angioedema attacks in HAE are characterized by painful, non-pruritic swelling of the face, larynx, 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, limbs, and/or genitalia, which may last up to 5 or more days. Most patients suffer 
multiple attacks per year and most patients with HAE experience attacks at multiple sites. Abdominal attacks 
are often associated with nausea, vomiting, and severe pain; intestinal symptoms resembling abdominal 
emergencies may lead to unnecessary surgery (Zuraw, 2008). 
Approximately 50% of all patients with HAE will experience a potentially life-threatening laryngeal attack in 
their lifetime (Bork et al., 2006). The incidence of death due to untreated laryngeal attacks is 30% to 40% 
and the risk of death is 3-fold greater in undiagnosed vs diagnosed patients (Bork et al., 2012; Bork et al., 
2000). An audit conducted in the United Kingdom identified 55 HAE-related deaths in 33 families (Jolles et 
al., 2014). One death secondary to laryngeal oedema was recorded among 10 HAE patients included in a 
recent French study (Javaud et al., 2015). 
The reported median age of first symptom onset varies in the literature, but symptoms often begin in 
childhood or adolescence (Maurer et al. 2018) with angioedema episodes usually beginning between 5 and 11 
years of age (Farkas 2010). Per the WAO/EAACI guidelines revised in 2017, the median age of symptom 
onset is approximately 12 years of age. The mean age for first symptom onset reported from large studies is 
6 to 12 years of age (Bork et al, 2006; Bygum et al, 2011; Farkas 2010; Roche et al, 2005). Limited 
information on cases of HAE attacks is available in the literature on children younger than 3 years of age 
(Bygum et al, 2011; El-Hachem et al, 2005; Nanda et al, 2015; Roche et al, 2005. While the prevalence of 
patients who have HAE attacks is low in the paediatric population <6 years, abdominal and cutaneous attacks 
have been reported in children as young as 1 year of age (Agostini et al, 2004; Bork et al, 2006), and 
laryngeal attacks have been reported in children as young as 3 years of age (Craig et al, 2012; Farkas 2010). 
The diagnosis of hereditary angioedema is made by clinical evaluation, patient history, and blood tests that 
detect decreased levels of complement proteins. In instances of high clinical suspicion and recurrent episodic 
angioedema of uncertain aetiology, genetic testing is indicated. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Current available treatment options for subjects aged 2 to <12 years are summarised in Table 1.

c 
Approved in patients >18 years in the US 
Only approved for on-demand use in the US 
Approved in patients ≥13 years in the US 
In the EU, only Cinryze, Orladeyo and Takhzyro are currently approved for routine prevention of HAE attacks; 
Cinryze in subjects ≥6 years, and Takhzyro and Orladeyo in subjects ≥12 years. Cinryze is administered 
intravenously every 3-4 day. Intravenously administered Berinert is indicated for pre-procedure prevention 
only and not for routine prophylaxis in the paediatric population, whereas subcutaneously administered 
Berinert is authorised for prevention of recurrent hereditary angioedema attacks in adolescents and adults.  
Furthermore, antifibrinolytic agents (mainly tranexamic acids) are indicated as HAE prophylaxis. In clinical 
practice, tranexamic acid seems to be mainly used in subjects in which C1-INH replacement therapy is not 
available or not approved, e.g., children and pregnant women. 
2.2.  About the product 
Lanadelumab is a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin G (IgG) monoclonal antibody that inhibits 
plasma kallikrein (pKal) proteolytic activity without binding prekallikrein, the inactive precursor found in the 
circulation.  
Increased pKal activity leads to angioedema attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) through 
the proteolysis of high-molecular-weight-kininogen (HMWK) to generate cleaved HMWK (cHMWK) and 
bradykinin, a potent vasodilator that increases vascular permeability resulting in swelling and pain associated 
with HAE. It has been demonstrated that patients with HAE due to C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency or 
dysfunction have increased pKal activity, as indirectly measured by amount of cHMWK, both during and in 
between HAE attacks.

2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
Lanadelumab was first approved under the trade name of Takhzyro for routine prophylaxis to prevent attacks 
of hereditary angioedema in patients 12 years and older in the United States (23 Aug 2018), Canada (19 Sep 
2018), and European Union (22 Nov 2018). Currently, lanadelumab is approved in over 50 countries globally.  
The initial approval was based on results from 4 registrational trials: 2 Phase 1 studies (Study DX-2930-01 
and Study DX-2930-02); 1 pivotal Phase 3 study (Study DX-2930-03 [HELP Study]); and 1 Phase 3 open 
label extension (OLE) study (Study DX-2930-04 [HELP Study Extension]). 
Study SHP643-301 is part of the PIP (“Study 3”). According to the Compliance report (EMEA-C-001864-
PIP01-15-M07; PIP decision number P/0214/2022), compliance with the PIP for this study was confirmed. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an extension application to add a new strength of 150 mg for lanadelumab solution for injection in 
pre-filled syringe (PFS) and to extend the indication to include paediatric use (2 to <12 years). The new 
indication is only applicable to the new 150 mg strength presentations. 
The finished product is presented as a sterile preservative-free solution for injection for subcutaneous 
administration containing 150 mg of lanadelumab as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: disodium phosphate dihydrate, citric acid monohydrate, histidine, sodium chloride, 
polysorbate 80, and water for injections. 
The lanadelumab 150 mg PFS finished product formulation is identical to the formulation in the commercial 
finished product presentations (300 mg vial and 300 mg PFS). 
The product is available in a pre-filled glass (Type I) syringe with bromobutyl stopper. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
As the active substance is the same as for the 300 mg vial presentation and the 300 mg PFS presentation, no 
new information was submitted. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Lanadelumab finished product is a sterile preservative-free solution for subcutaneous administration of 
lanadelumab at a concentration of 150 mg/mL and is provided as a pre-filled syringe for a dosage strength of 
150 mg. 
Each pre-filled syringe is filled to deliver a nominal volume (1.0 mL) of 150 mg lanadelumab finished product. 
No formula overages are included. 
Assessment report 
EMA/440820/2023 
Page 11/64 
 
 
Besides the active ingredient, lanadelumab, the composition comprises only compendial components - 
disodium phosphate dihydrate, citric acid monohydrate, histidine, sodium chloride, polysorbate 80, water for 
injections.  
Excipients are the same as for the 300 mg vial presentation and the 300 mg PFS presentation. The excipients 
and their functions in the finished product are provided. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. No novel excipients or excipients of human 
or animal origin are used.  
The finished product is manufactured by sterile filtration and aseptic filling of the active substance into 
syringes after thawing, pooling, mixing, and bioburden reduction filtration. 
The primary container closure system consists of a 1 mL format pre-filled Type I glass syringe for 150 mg 
dosage, fitted with a bromobutyl rubber stopper. Each syringe is intended for single administration.  
Compatibility of lanadelumab with the excipients has been demonstrated. There is no difference in the 
formulation between the finished product in the vial and in the PFS. 
Manufacturing process development 
Comparability 
An overview of the changes between the 150 mg PFS and 300 mg PFS processes are described. Since there 
was no change in the active substance manufacturing process or the finished product formulation, the risk to 
product quality was expected to be minimal. To confirm the minimal impact from the process and container 
closure system changes on product quality for 150 mg PFS, an analytical comparability assessment was 
performed between lanadelumab finished product vials and 150 mg PFS. The results are highly similar and 
comparability can be concluded.  
Container closure system 
The container closure system is a pre-filled syringe consisting of a glass barrel with staked-in needle, a 
rubber stopper, a plunger rod and a backstopper. The container closure complies with the Ph. Eur. 
Requirements, as applicable. The information regarding control of the container closure parts is considered 
sufficient.  
The 150 mg (1 mL) lanadelumab PFS for injection is a single integral product and a Notified Body opinion was 
provided. 
The integrity of the container closure system was evaluated and considered appropriate. Based on the results 
from extractables and leachables studies, it is concluded that the container closure materials do pose a 
negligible safety risk to patients. The syringe materials are biocompatible as tested per relevant guidelines, 
and compatible with the finished product.  
The proposed primary packaging material is considered suitable for its intended use.  
Also, the ability of the secondary packaging to provide protection for lanadelumab finished product from light 
has been evaluated. The secondary packaging carton was shown to be effective in blocking out light and 
mitigating the light sensitivity. Compatibility 
The biocompatibility of contacting materials was tested and all device constituent parts have been shown to 
be biocompatible.

2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturer(s) 
Lanadelumab PFS is manufactured under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions on a pre-
filled syringe line in a multi-product manufacturing facility. 
The 150 mg ml PFS finished product is prepared by thawing and pooling of Lanadelumab active substance, 
mixing, bioburden reduction and sterile filtration, aseptic filling into syringes, shipping to labeling and final 
assembly, secondary packaging and storage. 
The manufacturing process and process controls are summarised in flow charts and tables. The purpose of 
each step is clearly stated, and a brief description is provided.  
The lanadelumab PFS manufacturing process is controlled by process parameters (critical and non-critical) 
and in-process controls that have been established to ensure consistent process performance and product 
quality. 
The control strategy for the 150 mg lanadelumab PFS manufacturing process was established in the same 
manner as the lanadelumab vial manufacturing process and the 300 mg PFS manufacturing process. The 
control strategy was developed based on current product and process understanding, which provides 
assurance of required process performance and final finished product quality. 
A list of critical quality attributes (CQA) is provided, together with a summary of the control strategy.  
It can be concluded that the descriptions of the proposed manufacturing process and process controls are 
acceptable. In summary, the lanadelumab 150 mg PFS finished product process is under control.  
The critical process parameters (CPPs) acceptable ranges described are the proven acceptable ranges (PARs). 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
The 150 mg lanadelumab PFS finished product program took an integrated risk-based approach to process 
validation. Characterization studies were performed using small-scale models which supported the criticality 
assessment of CPPs and establishment of PARs and NORs. The consistency, robustness, and control of full-
scale manufacturing were demonstrated through the PPQ campaign. 
An extensive set of studies for process validation is presented. The process validation data provided comprise 
PPQ data, hold time studies, validation of aseptic processing and shipping validation. 
The PPQ was successfully executed, and the study results met acceptance criteria, thus validating the 
commercial manufacturing process.  
The process validation of the finished product manufacturing steps is adequately described and reported.

2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The release and shelf-life specification for lanadelumab finished product PFS has been established to ensure 
the identity, strength, purity, quality, and safety of the product throughout its shelf life. 
The specification is consistent with the ICH Guideline Q6B. The release acceptance criteria for the finished 
product in syringes are the same as those for the active substance, except for the inclusion of extractable 
volume, attributes related to the container closure system, and device functionality. 
No new product-related impurities or degradation products have been identified. 
The levels of elemental impurities found (ICH Q3D) demonstrated to be acceptable to ensure the safety of 
lanadelumab finished product. 
For the 150 mg PFS, and in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) no risk evaluation concerning the 
presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product is necessary. 
Analytical procedures 
The test methods used for testing lanadelumab active substance are applicable for 150 mg and 300 mg PFS.  
Validation of analytical procedures 
The analytical procedures used for release and stability testing of 150 mg lanadelumab finished product PFS 
have been qualified or validated as appropriate. 
All non-compendial analytical test procedures for lanadelumab have been validated according to the ICH 
guideline Q2 (R1). 
Batch analysis 
The finished product lots were manufactured as part of process performance qualification for 150 mg PFS from 
the active substance lots manufactured using the commercial manufacturing process. Release test results are 
presented and all results met the commercial release specification for 150 mg PFS and demonstrate batch-to-
batch consistency. 
Reference standards or materials 
As the reference standards used are the same as for the 300 mg vial and 300 mg PFS presentation, no new 
information has been submitted. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The stability studies have been conducted in accordance with ICH guidelines. It is agreed that the proposed 
analytical test methods are stability indicating.  
A commercial shelf life for lanadelumab finished product of 24 months at the recommended long-term 
storage condition of 5 ± 3 °C is proposed. Other studies further support the proposed shelf life and the 
suitability of the secondary packaging. 
The proposed 24 months storage at long-term conditions (5 ± 3 °C) and the proposed in-use storage up to 
14 days ≤ 25 °C are found acceptably supported by data.

2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Lanadelumab is a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin subclass 1 (IgG1) kappa light chain monoclonal 
antibody targeting plasma kallikrein (pKal) and is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of 
hereditary angioedema in patients aged 12 years and older. Lanadelumab is a potent inhibitor of the 
proteolytic activity of active pKal for human, rat, and cynomolgus monkey. The drug substance 
manufacturing process uses a recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line grown in suspension 
culture. 
The Applicant has provided a justification for not performing ERA studies. The drug product is composed of 
naturally occurring amino acids; therefore lanadelumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
This application concerns an extension for the expanded use of lanadelumab for routine prophylaxis to 
prevent attacks and control the symptoms of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in pediatric patients 2 to <12 
years of age. TAKHZYRO was first approved for routine prophylaxis to prevent attacks of HAE in patients 12 
years and older in the EU on 22 November 2018.  
No new nonclinical studies of relevance have been submitted with this extension. However, the Applicant has 
submitted information on 4 nonclinical studies that have been conducted since submission of the original 
marketing authorisation application. These additional non-GLP pharmacology and pharmacokinetics studies 
were conducted to evaluate a different indication with a different route of administration. As they do not 
provide with new meaningful information for the present extension, they have not been assessed. The 
following information is selected from the EPAR from the initial marketing authorisation application:  
‘Repeat-dose studies evaluating once weekly SC injection in both rats (up to 28 days) and cynomolgus 
monkeys (up to 6 months) evidenced that lanadelumab was well-tolerated at doses of up to and including 50 
mg/kg (highest dose tested) with no organs of toxicity identified. Exposures in cynomolgus monkeys 
following 6 months of administration were approximately 23-fold greater than that noted at 300 mg q2 wks 
based on AUC. 
Lanadelumab is not expected to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material, as it is made up 
entirely of naturally occurring amino acids and contains no inorganic or synthetic linkers or other nonprotein 
portions; therefore no genotoxicity evaluation has been conducted.  
Carcinogenicity has not been evaluated in animals as based on the weight of evidence approach, 
lanadelumab is considered to have a low risk for carcinogenicity.  
The effects of lanadelumab on fertility were evaluated in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys. In a 13 week 
study, once weekly SC administration of lanadelumab had no effects on male or female fertility at doses of 10 
or 50 mg/kg (highest dose tested). Exposures in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys in the fertility study 
were approximately 21 fold greater than that noted at 300 mg q2 wks based on Cmax and AUC, respectively.  
In the ePPND study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys administered once weekly doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg 
(highest dose tested), there were no lanadelumab-related effects on pregnancy and parturition, embryo 
foetal development, survival, growth, and/or postnatal development of offspring. Exposures in the ePPND 
study were approximately 32 fold greater than that noted at 300 mg q2 wks based on AUC.’’

The MAH refers to the nonclinical safety studies evaluating SC administration of lanadelumab for up to 6 
months in cynomolgus monkeys and considers this to support use in the paediatric patient population aged ≥
2 to <12 years. The nonclinical program conducted to date indicated no safety signal or toxicity with 
subcutaneously administered lanadelumab at doses of up to and including the highest tested dose (50 
mg/kg, once weekly) for 6 months in cynomolgus monkeys 2.7 to 3.3 years old at initiation of dosing. This 
corresponds to juvenile (undefined lower limit to 12 years old) to adolescent (12 to 16/18 years old) aged 
humans (Morford et al, 2011). No specific target organ toxicity or toxicity relevant for developing organ 
systems was observed in the cynomolgus monkeys. This reasoning is acknowledged, albeit it could be 
questioned whether cynomolgus monkeys 2.7 to 3.3 years old represent children down to the age of two 
years. 
Further, as part of the application, reference was made to the results from the non-clinical ePPND study on 
pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys. At the maternal dose of 50 mg/kg prior to 
parturition. the neonates were potentially exposed to lanadelumab through placental transfer in utero, and 
through breast milk (at 0.20% of maternal plasma concentration), yielding plasma concentrations in 
neonates exceeded both the IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of the IC90 (90% inhibitory 
concentration) of 18,777 ng/mL for the formation of the cHMWK in a population pharmacokinetics model. The 
lanadelumab plasma concentration at postnatal Day 90 still exceeds the cHMWK IC50 level. There was not 
any evidence of adverse maternal or infant findings. The ePPND study in cynomolgus monkeys did not 
identify lanadelumab-related effects on pregnancy and parturition, embryo foetal development, survival, 
growth, and/or postnatal development of offspring with a margin of toxicity to NOAEL of 32x. Therefore, an 
update of the PI is not considered needed.  
In accordance with ICH S11, the existing non-clinical data did not identify findings which would warrant 
additional toxicity studies (i.e., JAS studies) to support the extension to include pediatric patients from the 
age of 2. The general toxicology studies performed in rats (up to 28 days) and monkey (up to 6 months 
duration) did not identify any target organs of toxicity and was overall well tolerated.  
As regards the environmental risk, lanadelumab is already used in existing marketed products and no 
significant increase in environmental exposure is anticipated as the drug product is composed of naturally 
occurring amino acids. Therefore, lanadelumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The extension is approvable from a non-clinical perspective. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Plasma concentrations of lanadelumab were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
with a validated range between 3.13 and 400 ng/mL. Serum samples were tested for ADA to lanadelumab 
using an electrochemiluminescence assay with an assay sensitivity of 46.62 ng/mL. Serum samples were also 
evaluated for the presence of NAbs to lanadelumab using an electrochemiluminescence assay. Plasma 
concentrations of cHMWK activity were tested on a Western blot assay and measured on a chemiluminescent 
Western blot scanner. 
ADME 
There are no new specific biopharmaceutic studies performed with lanadelumab.  
The intended to-be-marketed presentation will be a 1 mL prefilled syringe (PFS), which has an identical 
product formulation to the study drug used in Study SHP643-301. 
Population Pharmacokinetic analysis 
The population PK dataset consisted of 278 subjects (3476 post-dose samples), which included 21 (7.6%) 
paediatric patients with HAE (from study SHP643-301; 4 subjects aged 2 to < 6 years and 17 aged 6 to <12 
years) who had at least one PK and PD sample in Study SHP643-301 and were included in the analysis. In 
addition, 24 (8.6%) healthy subjects (DX-2930-01) and 233 (83.8%) patients with HAE (DX-2930 02, DX-
2930-03 and DX-2930-04) were included in the analysis. Study DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04 included a total 
of 22 adolescent patients with HAE (unique IDs), respectively, who received at least one dose of 
lanadelumab. A total of 2.3% of samples were BQL. 
A previously developed one-compartment model with linear elimination and first-order rate of absorption (Ka) 
was used to characterize the concentration-time profiles of lanadelumab. Model parameters were re-
estimated, including any covariate effects which were estimated as part of the most recent model. The final 
model (Table 3) included the effect of body weight of CL/F and V/F using fixed exponents (i.e. 0.75 and 1,

respectively) and the effect of health status (healthy volunteers and patients with HAE) on the CL/F of 
lanadelumab. 
The final population PK model was used to derive post hoc parameters as well as simulate the exposure in 
children aged 2 -12 years (10-53 kg).

Special populations 
Children 
Given the sparsity of the PK sampling, population PK modelling was used to provide post hoc parameter 
estimates for this study. Body weight was the main identified factor that affects the distribution and 
elimination lanadelumab. Following lanadelumab administration of 150 mg q2wks in subjects 6 to <12 years, 
the model-based median [range] time to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax) at steady state was 86 
[66-137] hours and the model-based median [range] half-life was 12.6 [9.59-27.3] days. The model-based 
means (SD) of Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and Cavg,ss were 41.6 (14.6), 26.2 (8.76), and 35.2 (11.8), respectively.  
Following lanadelumab administration of 150 mg q4wks in subjects 2 to <6 years, the model-based median 
[range] Tmax at steady state was 122 [108-135] hours and the model-based predicted median [range] half-
life was 11.7 [10.2-13.9] days. The model-based means (SD) of Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and Cavg,ss were 39.0 
(12.1), 12.0 (5.34), and 25.7 (8.92), respectively. Descriptive statistics of steady-state exposure parameters 
of lanadelumab in both age groups are presented in Table 4. 
Table 4: Descriptive Statistics of Steady-State Exposure Parameters of Lanadelumab 
Based on the popPK post hoc parameters, rich concentration-time profiles of lanadelumab for paediatric 
patients in the population PK analysis were simulated following repeated administration of lanadelumab, and 
exposure parameters under steady state conditions were derived.

Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Lanadelumab is a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa light chain monoclonal antibody 
that inhibits plasma kallikrein (pKal) proteolytic activity without binding prekallikrein, the inactive precursor 
found in the circulation. Increased pKal activity leads to angioedema attacks in patients with hereditary 
angioedema (HAE) through the proteolysis of high-molecular-weight-kininogen (HMWK) to generate cleaved 
HMWK (cHMWK) and bradykinin, a potent vasodilator that increases vascular permeability resulting in 
swelling and pain associated with HAE. It has been demonstrated that patients with HAE due to C1-inhibitor 
(C1-INH) deficiency or dysfunction have increased pKal activity, as indirectly measured by amount of 
cHMWK, both during and in between HAE attacks. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamic effect in the paediatric study (SHP643-301) was assessed by pKal activity, measured 
as cleaved high molecular weight kininogen (cHMWK) levels. These levels were used in the pooled population 
PK/PD modelling analysis. 
Plasma kallikrein activity in study SHP643-301 is summarised in Table 5. Corresponding data for the 
adult/adolescent study DX-2930-03 are given for comparison.

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
A population PK/PD analysis based on studies DX-2930-01 (healthy subjects), DX-2930-02 (patients, Multiple 
Ascending Dose-Study), DX-2930-03 (patients, “HELP” study) and DX-2930-04 (“HELP” extension study) was 
previously developed based on the 120-safety data cut-off (01-Jan-2018). An indirect-response Imax model 
was used to model the relationship between lanadelumab concentrations and cHMWK levels (%). This 
previously developed final model was considered as the new base model for the current analysis, which also 
included study SHP643-301 (paediatric study). The PK/PD dataset was constructed by including observed 
concentrations of lanadelumab (PK) and cHMWK levels (%) (PD). The mean Cmin,ss associated with the 150 
mg q4w (2 to < 6 years) and 150 mg q2w (6 to < 12 years) dosing were approximately 1.3- and 2.8-fold 
higher than the model estimated IC50 of cHMWK, respectively. 
Exposure-response analysis of efficacy was performed based on data collected in studies DX-2930-03, DX-
2930-04 and SHP643-301. For the longitudinal exposure-response analysis, longitudinal secondary exposure 
parameters (Cmax, Cmin and Cave) (i.e., for each month) were derived with the population PK model. The 
time to first HAE attack was explored as a function of the Cave,ss of lanadelumab in paediatric subjects 
(SHP643-301) and non-paediatric subjects (DX-2930-03). Cox-proportional hazard regression models were 
developed for the probability of a first HAE attack based on Cave,ss and/or Cmin,ss. 
Exposure-response analysis of safety was previously performed based on data collected in study DX-2930-03. 
The data was updated by including data from Study DX-2930-03, Study DX-2930-04 and SHP643-301. An 
exploratory exposure-response analysis was performed to assess the relationships between steady state 
exposure to lanadelumab (Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and Cave,ss) and selected laboratory parameters. The strength 
of the relationship was assessed using statistical estimator (r2, slope, and p-value for slope of 0). No 
significant relationship was noted in this pooled analysis.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The purpose of this application is to seek approval for the use of lanadelumab in paediatric patients 2 to <12 
years of age for routine prophylaxis to prevent attacks and control the symptoms of HAE. Study SHP346-301 
included 21 children aged 2 to <12 years. Data in children aged <5 years is limited (four subjects, 10-20 kg). 
There are no indications that the pathogenesis of HAE is different in the paediatric versus the adult and 
adolescent populations. Therefore, extrapolation of efficacy to the paediatric population using model-based 
analysis and simulation is considered an acceptable approach. Efficacy in the paediatric population 2 to <12 
years was supported by PK exposure matching and extrapolation of efficacy from adolescents and adults. 
Population PK modeling served as the primary basis of estimating lanadelumab PK parameters (ie, the 
primary endpoint) for Study SHP643-301. 
There is no new information regarding biopharmaceutics and analytical methods relevant to the clinical trial 
material used in Study SHP643-301.  
The analytical methods were previously validated and found acceptable. Lanadelumab plasma concentration 
data were obtained using an ELISA.  
The ADA and NAb assays were clearly described and adequately validated. In the initial MAA, it was agreed 
that, using either 0.1% or 1% cut-off, presence of neutralising anti-lanadelumab antibodies did not have any 
apparent effect on lanadelumab exposure, efficacy or reported AEs. All ADAs reported were of low titer. It is 
agreed to use the 0.1% cut point in the NAb assay instead of the usual 1% rejection threshold. 
The intended to-be-marketed presentation will be a 1 mL prefilled syringe (PFS), which has an identical 
product formulation to the study drug used in Study SHP643-301. The commercial 1 mL PFS presentation will 
have the same dosage, volume of injection and SC route of administration as the SHP643-301 study drug 
delivered with a disposable syringe at each injection time point in the study. As the formulation is identical 
between the two presentations, it is agreed that a dedicated PK study is not required for the transition from 
the vial product to the PFS product.  
The methods used to evaluate the population PK model are adequate. The conducted covariate analysis, and 
reasoning regarding not re-testing covariate that are known to have significant impact, is supported. The 
presented goodness-of-fit plots and prediction corrected visual predictive checks indicate that the model can 
adequately describe the data in the HAE population. It is of importance that the PK in children is adequately 
described as simulations are required to determine the adequacy of the proposed posology. For children aged 
≥2 years of age, it is not expected that factors other than body weight, affect the distribution or elimination 
of monoclonal antibodies compared to adults.  
The BLQ-samples were set to zero in the dataset. The MAH states that overall, 2.3% of all samples were BQL. 
Children 2 to <6 years have a lower Cmin compared to older children, however, the percent BQL samples 
was low in children 2-<6 years old as well (2.1%, pre-first dose samples excluded). The model parameters 
are estimated with low uncertainty. The MAH has presented figures stratified on study, age and body weight 
which indicate that the model can capture the paediatric data adequately.  
The adult target exposure range for different exposure parameters Q2W was based on the post hoc 
exposures derived from the model-based empirical bayes estimates (EBEs) for HAE subjects enrolled in 
Studies DX-2930-03 and 04 using the current population PK model that included Study SHP643-301 to derive 
the EBEs for both adults and children. It is considered not appropriate to change the model used to derive the 
target exposure, from the model used when the drug was approved in the target population (i.e., when the 
Assessment report 
EMA/440820/2023 
Page 26/64 
 
 
B/R was shown to be positive) as the target exposure then becomes a “moving target” with each new 
population/application. However, the model appears to be similar to the previous model (based on parameter 
estimation with and without study 301). Therefore, as there is minimal difference between the model 
developed based on adults and adolescents’ data only and the current model, no reanalysis was requested by 
CHMP.  
The MAH compared the simulated and observed exposure in children to the range in adults (≥18 years) from 
Study DX-2930-03 and -04.  The exposure matching consisted of matching the Cavg between 
adults/adolescents and paediatric subjects based on an exposure-response analysis.  However, the 
conclusions that Cavg is the driving parameter for efficacy including the dosing regimen cannot be 
determined with certainty with the data submitted and the possible clinical importance of Cmin cannot be 
dismissed. Therefore, it was concluded that Cmin must also be considered when determining the appropriate 
posology. To evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed posology, the MAH presented figures comparing 
the simulated exposure parameters to adult exposure stratified on weight (simulated with uniform weight 
distribution). The BLQ-concentrations were not removed for any population in the simulations. As weight, 
rather than age, is the main underlying factor determining the exposure, a dosing based on weight-bands, 
irrespective of age, has been implemented in the SmPC for children <12 years of age. For subjects aged 12 
and older, 300 mg Q2W was already approved, and this recommendation is maintained, however, a starting 
dose of 150 mg Q2W may be considered if the subjects weigh <40 kg which has also been implemented in 
section 4.2 of SmPC. 
cHMWK was accepted as a pharmacodynamic marker for pKal activity at time of initial marketing 
authorisation of lanadelumab. In study SHP643-301 at day 182 cHMWK had decreased to 59% of the 
baseline value in subjects receiving 150 mg q4w and to 40% with 150 q2w. Corresponding values for the 
adult study DX2930-03 were 40-53% (three dosing levels) and an increase to 115% in the placebo arm. 
Therefore, the decreased percentage of cHMWK reflects the inhibitory effect of lanadelumab on pKal activity 
supporting efficacy of lanadelumab.  
The MAH pooled the paediatric data with the adult and adolescent data and has conducted a concentration-
cHMWK analysis, a concentration-average monthly HAE attacks and time to first HAE attack analysis, and a 
concentration-safety analysis. One aspect of the exposure-time to first HAE attack model was to assess which 
exposure parameter drives the efficacy. However, due to several limitations the approval must be based on 
extrapolation of efficacy from the paediatric data with the data observed in adults and adolescents A PK/PD 
model to describe the relationship between lanadelumab concentrations and cHMWK levels (%) was 
developed. The goodness-of-fit indicate that there may be some model misspecification (trend in CWRES vs 
time plot) and the model maybe does not fully capture the change in %cHMWK over time. The pcVPC 
indicates a fairly well capture of the decrease of the median cHMWK (%) vs concentration, however, there is 
a slight overprediction by the model in Study SHP643-301. The model included weight on Kout and health 
status on Kin (healthy volunteer vs patient). Further, after inclusion of body weight, the MAH investigated 
age as a covariate; however, as weight was already included in the model and is correlated to age the results 
are confounded.  
The main issue with the exposure-response analysis of HAE attacks model is that patients in study DX-2930-
03 received lanadelumab 150 mg q4w, 300 mg q2w and 300 mg q4w. Due to the selected doses in each arm, 
Cavg and Cmin are expected to be correlated to a considerable degree and it is not possible to differentiate if 
it is Cavg or Cmin that drives the efficacy. In addition, although Cavg performed better than Cmin based on 
AIC, the difference in objective function value (OFV) was rather limited. Furthermore, it was concluded by the 
Assessment report 
EMA/440820/2023 
Page 27/64 
 
 
MAH that children have fewer HAE attacks compared to adults which may further complicates the analysis 
and conclusions. This relative difference has not been discussed by the MAH. 
In summary, the conclusion that Cavg is the driving parameter for efficacy and that Cmin has no impact on 
efficacy has not been convincingly demonstrated. Therefore, Cmin should be taken into consideration as a 
driving PK parameter for efficacy in the exposure-response analysis to determine the posology.  
The exposure-safety analysis was conducted by pooling the data from the 21 paediatric patients (<12 years 
old) with the data from 187 adult and adolescent subjects (unique ID’s) and performed a regression analysis 
of exposure versus selected safety parameters. No significant relationship was noted in this analysis, 
however, there is a limited number of paediatric subjects limiting the conclusion (see Clinical Safety section). 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Due to the rarity of the disease in younger children, the approval is based on extrapolation of efficacy from 
adults to children using a model-based approach. The population PK model is considered to adequately 
capture the exposure in children and to be adequate for simulation of exposure to be used for extrapolation.  
Body weight is the main covariate with greatest impact on exposure of lanadelumab, and therefore the 
posology is based on this.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program supporting the use of lanadelumab for routine prophylaxis to prevent 
attacks of HAE in paediatric patients consists of a single Phase 3 trial (Table 6)

Title of study 
Study SHP643-301: An Open-Label, Multicenter, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, 
and Pharmacodynamics of Lanadelumab for Prevention Against Acute Attacks of Hereditary Angioedema 
(HAE) in Pediatric Subjects 2 to <12 years of Age (SPRING STUDY) 
Methods 
Study SHP643-301 was an open-label, multicentre study (Figure 4) 
Figure 4: Study Design Schematic 
Subjects who experienced ≥1 angioedema attack during the observational period and who remained eligible 
per study criteria were to enter the lanadelumab treatment period for 52 weeks. Subjects were to stay in the 
observation period for a minimum of 4 weeks, but the observational period could be prolonged up to 12 
weeks if necessary. Subjects who reported more than 2 HAE attacks (confirmed by the investigator and 
agreed with the sponsor’s medical monitor) within the first 2 weeks of the observation period could exit the 
observational period and enter the treatment period early. 
The attack rate in the observation period served as the baseline for the study.

•  Study Participants  
Main eligibility criteria included paediatric patients (2 to <12 years) of both sexes with a diagnosis of HAE 
(Type I or II) and a historical baseline HAE attack rate of ≥1.0 angioedema attack per 3 months (12 weeks). 
•  Treatments 
The lanadelumab dose regimens were:   
•  150 mg q2wks for subjects 6 to <12 years old; total of 27 doses administered over the 52-week 
treatment period.  
•  150 mg q4wks for subjects 2 to <6 years old; total of 14 doses administered over 52-week treatment 
period 
Subjects 6 to <12 years of age could switch to a dosing regimen of 150 mg q4wks in Treatment Period B at 
the investigator’s discretion and sponsor’s medical monitor approval, if they were well controlled (e.g., 
attack-free) for 26 weeks with lanadelumab treatment in this study.  
The fixed age-based dosing regimens in Study SHP643-301 were selected based on population PK simulations 
using a model generated from adult data. For details, please refer to the Pharmacokinetic section. 
The new pre-filled syringe with 150 mg lanadelumab in 1 ml for paediatric use under assessment in the 
current procedure was not used during the study. Instead, a ready-to-use solution with a lanadelumab 
concentration of 150 mg/mL provided in a single-use 2-mL glass vial (150 mg/ 1 mL) identical to the 
commercially available product was used. 
Acute HAE attacks during the study were to be managed in accordance with the investigator’s usual care of 
their patients, including use of individualized acute therapy that the investigator deemed as medically 
appropriate. Use of C1-INH was permitted as acute therapy but not as long-term prophylaxis. Short-term 
prophylactic treatment for HAE was permitted if medically indicated, i.e., to avoid angioedema complications 
from medically indicated procedures. 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and PK of lanadelumab in paediatric subjects 
(2 to <12 years of age) with HAE. Efficacy was a secondary objective.

•  Sample size 
The sample size for this paediatric study was driven by feasibility considerations as enrolment of paediatric 
subjects 2 to <12 years old was expected to be difficult. The primary emphasis was to assess the safety and 
PK of lanadelumab in this age group but also to generate data on clinical outcomes if subjects had sufficient 
baseline attack frequency for evaluation.  
At least 20 paediatric subjects (2 to <12 years of age) with at least 5 subjects in each age group of 2 to <9 
years of age and 9 to <12 years of age were planned for enrolment to ensure that a minimum of 15 subjects 
complete 1 year (52 weeks) of treatment on the study. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable since the study was single-armed and open-label. 
•  Statistical methods 
Due to the limited population and the lack of comparator in the study, only descriptive statistics applied. 
All safety and efficacy analyses were based on the safety set, which was defined as all subjects who received 
any dose of lanadelumab

Characteristics of Investigator-confirmed HAE Attacks 
The mean (SD) investigator-confirmed HAE attack duration (excluding no attacks) was 15.05 (16.540) hours 
during the Overall Treatment period, compared to 29.8 (22.01) hours during the baseline observation period.  
The mean (SD) HAE attack severity (categorized as 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe) was 1.99 (0.397) 
(excluding no attacks) during the Overall Treatment period, compared to 1.70 (0.404) during the baseline 
observation period. 
The most frequent maximum HAE attack severity was no attack during the Overall Treatment period (16 
[76.2%] subjects), compared to moderate during the baseline observation period (14 [66.7%] subjects). One 
subject experienced a severe HAE attack during the study treatment period compared to 3 subjects during 
the baseline observation period. 
Time to First Attack 
During the Overall Treatment period, 5 (23.81%) subjects had an investigator-confirmed HAE attack. The 
median time to first investigator-confirmed HAE attack was not calculable, because less than 50% of subjects 
experienced attacks during the given study period.

Five subjects had 23 investigator-confirmed HAE attacks (1 [9.1%] subject with 5 HAE attacks in the q4wks 
group and 5 [27.8%] subjects with 18 HAE attacks in the q2wks group). Two of the 5 subjects who had HAE 
attacks had events that required rescue medication. For the majority of events (22 events), the subjects did 
not require supportive treatment; 1 event required antiemetic as supportive treatment.

C1-inhibitor Cinryze and the pKal inhibitor Orladeyo, are indicated for routine prophylaxis of HAE in the EU. 
For this indication, Cinryze is approved from the age of 6 years and Orladeyo from the age of 12 years.  
The scopes of the current application are to extend the indication for Takhzyro to paediatric subjects from the 
age of two years and to include the 150 mg in 1 ml pre-filled syringe as a new strength for paediatric use. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study for the paediatric indication, Study SHP643-301, was an open-label, multicentre study, 
uncontrolled study. The study design was in accordance with the PIP.  
At the time of the orphan designation (2015), HAE was reported to affect less than 0.5 in 10,000 people in 
the European Union (EU). Furthermore, angioedema episodes usually begin between 5 and 11 years of age 
(Farkas 2010), leading to diagnosis a couple of years later. The number of paediatric subjects eligible for the 
study was thus limited.  
Main eligibility criteria included paediatric patients (2 to <12 years) of both sexes with a diagnosis of HAE 
(Type I or II) and a historical baseline HAE attack rate of ≥1 angioedema attack per 3 months.  
The baseline HAE attack rate was evaluated during a run-in period of 4-12 weeks. To be eligible to enter the 
treatment period, subjects were to have a baseline attack rate of at least one attack per 4 weeks. Subjects 
with frequent attacks could exit the run-in period early. The decision to start treatment before the end of the 
four-week run-in period may overestimate the baseline HAE attack rate. Upon request, the MAH has clarified 
that no subject exited the run-in period early, i.e., before the end of the protocol-defined 4-week run-in. 
In the pivotal study for marketing authorisation of Takhzyro in adults and adolescents, Study DX-2930-03, a 
baseline HAE attack rate of 1 attack per 4 weeks was requested. The approved indication does however not

include any restrictions on disease severity. Taking the mechanism of action into account, it was considered 
by CHMP that the kallikrein-kinin system probably is involved in angioedema formation also in HAE of other 
types, supporting a broad HAE indication despite the fact that only patients with HAE Type I and II were 
included in Study DX-2930-03. Likewise, in the present study, only subjects with HAE Type 1 and Type 2 
were studied.  
Overall, the eligibility criteria are considered to reflect the target population.  
The study comprised of two 26-weeks long treatment periods, Treatment Period A and Treatment Period B. 
During Treatment Period A, dosing was age based (6 to <12 years of age: lanadelumab 150 mg q2wks; 2 to 
<6 years of age: 150 mg q4wks). In Treatment Period B, subjects 6 to <12 years of age could switch to150 
mg q4wks if they had been well controlled (e.g., attack-free) for 26 weeks.  
The main objectives of the study were safety and pharmacokinetics. There was thus no primary efficacy 
endpoint in the study. The main efficacy outcome, assessed as a secondary endpoint, change in number of 
investigator-confirmed HAE attacks for the Overall Treatment period, is considered clinically relevant and was 
also accepted as the primary endpoint in Study DX-2930-03.  
The sample size was driven by feasibility considerations as enrolment of paediatric subjects 2 to <12 years 
old was expected to be difficult. At least 20 paediatric subjects (2 to <12 years of age) with at least 5 
subjects in each age group of 2 to <9 years of age and 9 to <12 years of age were planned for enrolment to 
ensure that a minimum of 15 subjects complete 52 weeks of treatment on the study.  
Due to the limited population and the lack of comparator, only descriptive statistics applied. 
Given the rarity of the disease in general and in the paediatric population in particular, study design and 
conduct are considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study Population 
The planned sample size was reached. In total, 24 subjects were screened, and 21 subjects enrolled in the 
study (age cohort 2-<6 years: n=4, age cohort 6-<12 years: n=17).  
Of the 21 subjects treated in the study, 20 subjects completed study treatment (Treatment Period A and B; 
52 Weeks). The remaining subject discontinued the study prematurely at day 32 due to withdrawal by the 
parent/guardian, leaving the 2-<6-year age cohort with only 3 subjects from Week 5.  
The mean age in the 2-<6-year cohort was 4.45 years and in the 6-<12-year cohort 8.68 years. The 
youngest subject enrolled was 3.5 years old and the lowest weight was 15.8 kg. The older age cohort is 
considered acceptable in age distribution with a substantial representation of subjects in the lower part of the 
age interval. Albeit formally fulfilling the planned sample size with 5 subjects in the age group of 2 to <9 
years of age, the representation of the 2-<6-year cohort is very scarce and non-existing below the age of 3.5 
years.  
Both sexes were represented in the study. Participants were recruited from EU and North America (US, 
Canada). Of 21 subjects in the study, 6 subjects (28%) were from the EU. In Study DX-2930-03, a 
comparable fraction (21%) of the subjects were from Europe.  
The mean number of historical HAE attacks was similar in the two age cohorts (e.g., 17 HAE attacks during 
the last 12 months on the younger age cohort versus 15.2 in the older age cohort) but markedly lower than 
in study DX-2930-03 (36 HAE attacks during the last 12 months). The same pattern was seen during the run-
in period (1.86, 1.84 and 3.48 attacks/month for younger and older age cohort in Study SHP643-301, and 
Assessment report 
EMA/440820/2023 
Page 42/64 
 
 
DX-2930-03, respectively). A difference in attack rate between that paediatric and adult studies was 
anticipated, as the attack rate often increases in children with HAE reaching puberty.  
Altogether, the study populations in studies DX-2930-03 and SHP643-301 are considered comparable with 
the exception of age.  
In both the 2-<6 and 6-<12 age cohorts, there were subjects with over 50 HAE attacks during the last 12 
months before the study, supporting the need for a prophylactic treatment also in younger children. 
Seven subjects switched from q2wks to q4wks dosing during Treatment Period B. In addition, one subject (2-
<6-years of age) switched dosing from q4wks to q2wks in Treatment Period B due to recurrent attacks at the 
q4wks dose. At the q4w dosing (210 days), this subject experienced a HAE attack rate of 0.7 attacks/month, 
decreasing to 0.2 attacks/month after the switch (152 days).  
In the approved posology for adults and adolescents, there is a wording reflecting the possibility of reducing 
the dose in asymptomatic subjects. A similar wording is proposed for the paediatric population. This measure 
to avoid unnecessarily high dosing is appreciated. No subject switching to a lower dose in Treatment Period B 
returned to the higher dose due to recurrence of symptoms. 
Results 
The main efficacy outcome was Number of Investigator-confirmed HAE Attacks results for the Overall 
Treatment Period (Day 0 through Day 364) as expressed as mean number of HAE attacks/month (HAE attack 
rate). Baseline HAE attack rate was established during the run-in period.  
No comparative statistical analyses were planned or performed in Study SHP643-301. There was however a 
marked numerical decrease in HAE attack rate from 1.84 attacks/month at baseline to 0.08 through Day 364 
(change from baseline: 95%), supporting a positive and clinically relevant effect on the rate of HAE attacks in 
the overall study population.  
Given the very low number of subjects in the younger age cohort (n=4 of which one discontinued the study 
at Day 32 and one switched to q2W dosing day 211), no conclusions could be drawn from this population. 
Data from Treatment Period A does however suggest a similar treatment effect in both age cohorts (2-<6: 
1.72 to 0.15 attacks/month [95% reduction]; 6-<12: 1.84 to 0.08 attacks/month [93% reduction]). A 
subgroup analysis per age group for the Overall Treatment period also indicate a positive effect in the 
younger age cohort (1.86 to 0.18 attacks/month [94% reduction]). This data should however be interpreted 
with very large caution.  
The results from the main efficacy outcome are supported by other secondary efficacy endpoints, for example 
attack-free subjects. During the Overall Treatment period, 16/21 (76%) of the subjects were attack-free 
compared to none during the baseline observation period. Of note, the baseline observation period was up to 
84 days long compared to the 364 days of the Overall Treatment period, further emphasising a positive effect 
on HAE Attack rate. There was a numerically higher percentage of attack-free subjects in the lanadelumab 
150 mg q4w versus the 150 mg q2w cohort (91% and 72%, respectively). This is anticipated since subjects 
treated with lanadelumab 150 mg q2w through Day 182 were allowed to switch to the 150 mg q4w posology 
if attack-free. 
Altogether, the limited efficacy data from Study SHP643-301 is fully in line with the data from study DX-
2930-03 and its extension study DX-2930-04, and in support of a consistent and clinically relevant positive 
effect of lanadelumab in children 6-12 years of age.  
Assessment report 
EMA/440820/2023

A similar positive treatment effect was seen also in the age cohort 2-<6 years; however, the data should be 
interpreted with caution due to this very limited population (n=3 after treatment week 5). Additional data in 
particular from the PD popPK analysis would support extrapolation in this young age group. (see below). 
Additional aspects related to extrapolation of data 
Due to the rareness of HAE in pre-pubertal children, approval of Takhzyro in the paediatric population is 
based on clinical data from Study SHP643-301 in combination with extrapolation of data from the pivotal 
adult and adolescent study DX-2930-03. 
There are no indications that the pathogenesis of HAE is different in the paediatric versus the adult and 
adolescent populations. This is supported by the pharmacodynamic marker cHMWK as detailed in the 
discussion on clinical pharmacology (section 2.6.3.). Furthermore, as discussed above, the study populations 
in studies DX-2930-03 and SHP643-301 are considered comparable with the exception of age. 
The median age for first symptom onset reported from large studies is generally greater than 6 years of age. 
Overall, 21 subjects received at least 1 dose of lanadelumab in Study SHP643-301 and were included in the 
safety and PK datasets, however most subjects (n=17) were in the 6 to <12 years age group. Given that 
there are no known differences in the clinical presentation (other than a lower frequency and severity of 
attacks) in children <12 years or differences in the underlying pathophysiology of HAE between adult and 
paediatric subjects with HAE, efficacy in the paediatric population 2 to <12 years was supported by PK 
exposure matching and extrapolation of efficacy from adolescents (12 to <18 years) and adults (≥18 years). 
Population PK modelling served as the primary basis of estimating lanadelumab PK parameters (i.e., the 
primary endpoint) for Study SHP643-301.  
Dosing recommendations 
The fixed age-based dosing regimens in Study SHP643-301 were selected based on population PK simulations 
using a model generated from adult data and exposure-response analysis. The results show that children 2-5 
years old have a low Cmin with the posology initially proposed by the MAH, based on age-bands, compared 
to the target exposure in adults. Further, concluding that Cavg is the driving parameter for efficacy and that 
Cmin has no impact on efficacy has not been convincingly demonstrated. Therefore, based on the totality of 
evidence submitted, it was concluded that Cmin must also be considered when determining the appropriate 
posology. Further information is provided in discussion on clinical pharmacology (see section 2.6.3). 
Given that weight is a more relevant factor to exposure than age (see section 2.6.3), a posology based on 
weight bands has therefore been introduced in subjects 2 - <12 years of age in section 4.2 of SmPC. Taking 
the PK parameters Cmax, Cmin and Cavg into account, an acceptable posology could be identified for all 
weight bands except for patients weighing 10 - <20 kg. The posology proposed, 150 mg q4w, is expected to 
yield a too low Cmin in a majority of children weighing 10- <20 kg compared to adults given 300 mg Q2W, 
whereas Cmax is expected to exceed adult Cmax with approximately 38% (geometric mean). This is similar 
to the Cmax accepted for adolescents given 300 mg q4w at Takhzyro marketing authorisation. With a dosing 
of 75 ug q2w, this population is expected to have similar Cmax, Cavg and Cmin as adults on the approved 
dose. However, there is no prefilled syringe available for administration of 75 mg. Finally, 150 mg q3w in 
children weighing 10 - <20 kg would yield an acceptable Cmin and Cavg but a Cmax approximately 55% 
higher than in adults (geometric mean) with 42% of the population expected to exceed the 95th percentile for 
adults. There are no signals indicating any safety issues associated with this. Nevertheless, it is considered 
more prudent to start with a more conservative dosing, thereby also avoiding an unnecessary high dosing 
frequency in the smallest children. Therefore, a starting dose of 150 mg Q4W for children weighing 10 - <20 
Assessment report 
EMA/440820/2023 
Page 44/64 
 
 
kg, with a possibility to switch the dosing interval to 150 mg Q3W if necessary due to insufficient attack 
control, is considered an acceptable dosing strategy as detailed in section 4.2 of SmPC. 
A weight band-based dosing was discussed also for adult and adolescent subjects. However, in order to avoid 
the trouble and potential risk for medicinal error with changing an established posology, keeping the age-
based posology in adults and adolescents is accepted. Further, a wording informing on the handling of dosing 
when switching from paediatric to adult/adolescent posology and a notion that the “paediatric dosing” may 
also be considered as starting dose in adults and adolescents with a body weight < 40 kg have been 
introduced in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Further, recommendations for missed doses recommendations have 
been added in section 4.2 of SmPC.  
Based on this, extrapolation of efficacy from the adult and adolescent populations in Study DX-2930-03 to 
support the limited clinical data from Study SHP643-301 is considered adequate as the MAH has provided an 
acceptable posology for children 2 to < 12 years of age rendering similar levels of drug exposures as for the 
approved populations. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease, which is normally even more rare and milder in 
children. Nevertheless, pre-treatment data from Study SHP643-301 supports the need for a prophylactic 
treatment also in younger children. 
With only 21 subjects enrolled in the study, of which 17 were 6-<12 years of age and four 3.5-<6 years of 
age, Study SHP643-301 is considered to mainly provide supportive data.  
The limited efficacy data from Study SHP643-301 is in support of a positive effect of lanadelumab in children 
6-12 years of age. A similar positive treatment effect was seen also in the age cohort 2-<6 years; however, 
no firm conclusions can be drawn from this very limited population (n=3 after treatment week 5).  
In view of the scarcity of paediatric data, the rarity of the disease and the common pathogenesis of HAE 
between children and adults/adolescents, extrapolation of efficacy from the adult and adolescent populations 
in Study DX-2930-03 to support the limited clinical data from Study SHP643-301 is considered adequate. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
Study SHP643-301, which was a single arm study, is the only study within the clinical development program 
to include paediatric subjects (2 to <12 years). The safety profile of lanadelumab was previously established 
in adult and adolescents (12 to <18 years) from the pivotal Phase 3 study (Study DX-2930-03) and the OLE 
study (Study DX-2930-04) (EMEA/H/C/4806). 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
After the 26-week Treatment Period A, subjects were allowed to change dose regimen. In Treatment Period 
B, 7 subjects 6 to <12 years switched to the q4wks dose regimen, and 1 subject (6 to 12 years of age) 
switched to the q2wks dose regimen.  
The overall treatment exposure is summarised in Table 17.

Approximately half of the doses (46.3%) were administered by study staff in the clinic while approximately 
the other half of the doses were administered by a parent/caregiver either at home (26.6%) or in the clinic 
(20.9%).

Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Overall, 4 (19.0%) subjects reported a total of 7 non-HAE attack TEAEs of SMQ-defined hypersensitivity, 
including one subject who developed antidrug antibodies (ADAs) during the study. The most frequently 
reported SOC in this category was skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders with 2 (9.5%) subjects reporting 5 
events, and the most frequently reported PT was erythema with 1 (4.8%) subject reporting 2 events.  
None of the 7 non-HAE attack TEAEs of SMQ-defined hypersensitivity were considered related to 
lanadelumab, and none of the events were severe in intensity. 
The subject who developed ADAs and had an SMQ-defined hypersensitivity reaction experienced 1 non-HAE 
attack TEAE of eosinophil count increased, which was mild in severity. The event did not occur at the time the 
subject tested ADA positive and resolved without any action taken. 
Bleeding Events  
Overall, 3 (14.3%) subjects reported a total of 4 non-HAE attack TEAEs of SMQ-defined bleeding events. The 
most frequently reported SOC in this category was vascular disorders with 1 (4.8%) subject reporting 2 
events; both events were for the PT of hematoma. All other non-HAE attack TEAEs of SMQ-defined bleeding 
events were reported once by 1 (4.8%) subject overall.

None of the 4 non-HAE attack TEAEs of SMQ-defined bleeding events were considered related to 
lanadelumab, and none of the events were severe in intensity. 
Hypercoagulability Events 
No AESIs of hypercoagulation were reported by the investigators, and no non-HAE attack TEAEs of SMQ-
defined hypercoagulation were recorded in Study SHP643-301. 
Injection Site Reactions  
Overall, 7 (33.3%) subjects reported a total of 123 TEAEs of ISRs; 121 of which were considered related to 
lanadelumab, and 20 were considered related and severe in 1 subject.  
All 123 ISR TEAEs reported were within the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions. The 
most frequently reported ISR TEAEs overall by PT were injection site pain (6 [28.6%] subjects reported 88 
TEAEs with a rate of 4.40), and injection site erythema (3 [14.3%] subjects reported 29 TEAEs with a rate of 
1.45). 
2.6.8.4.  Supportive Safety Findings 
The safety profile of lanadelumab was previously established in adult and adolescents (12 to <18 years) from 
the pivotal Phase 3 study (Study DX-2930-03) and the OLE study (Study DX-2930-04). Overall, the 
occurrence of commonly reported AEs in paediatric subjects in Study SHP643-301 was generally consistent 
with that previously reported in adults and adolescents from Studies DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (excluding HAE attack reported events) by system organ class (SOC) in 
lanadelumab-treated subjects in Study DX-2930-03 were general disorders and administration site conditions 
(54.8%), and infections and infestations (51.2%). The most frequently reported TEAEs by preferred term 
(PT) were injection site pain (42.9%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (23.8%), headache (20.2%), 
injection site erythema (9.5%), injection site bruising (7.1%), and dizziness (6.0%). 
In Study DX-2930-04, TEAEs (excluding HAE attack reported events) were most frequently reported within 
the SOCs of infections and infestations (79.7%), and general disorders and administration site conditions 
(61.8%). The most frequently reported TEAEs by PT were injection site pain (47.2%), viral upper respiratory 
tract infection (42.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (25.9%), and headache (24.5%). 
Overall, the occurrence of injection site reactions (ISRs) in paediatric subjects in StudySHP643-301 was 
generally consistent with the occurrence reported in adults and adolescents in Studies DX-2930-03 and DX-
2930-04. 
In Study DX-2930-03, 84 lanadelumab-treated subjects received 2118 injections and had 398 ISRs (18.8%). 
There were no serious or severe ISRs reported in lanadelumab-treated subjects, and most of the ISRs were 
mild in severity. The most frequent ISRs reported by PT were injection site pain (42.9%), injection site 
erythema (9.5%), and injection site bruising (7.1%). The majority of ISRs were considered related to 
lanadelumab treatment and resolved within 30 minutes. 
During the treatment period of Study DX-2930-04, 117 (55.2%) subjects had a total of 2287 ISRs. These 
ISRs occurred across a collective 11899 doses. The most frequent ISRs reported by subjects overall by PT 
during the treatment period were injection site pain (47.2%), injection site erythema (17.0%), injection site 
bruising (12.3%), and injection site swelling (8.0%). None of the ISRs were serious or severe, and most were

mild in severity. The majority of ISRs were related to lanadelumab treatment and resolved within a day 
(70.2% resolved within an hour) 
2.6.8.5.  Laboratory findings 
According to the MAH, the majority of subjects had normal clinical laboratory values throughout study 
SHP643-301. Overall, no clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed for either treatment 
group for any of the laboratory parameters. This is further reviewed in the Discussion on Clinical Safety.  
Two subjects were reported with clinically significant abnormal laboratory results. One subject who switched 
from the q2wks to q4wks treatment regimen experienced 2 postbaseline clinically significant abnormal 
chemistry values, both of which were during the q2wks treatment regimen at Visit 16 (Day 112); the subject 
had a low chloride value and a high sodium value on this day. In addition, one subject in the q2wks group 
had 1 event of eosinophil count increased, which was considered clinically significant at Visit 1; this event 
was reported as a TEAE and was considered mild in severity.

2.6.8.7.  Safety in special populations 
The safety database in the paediatric population consists of 21 subjects aged 3.5 to 12 years. No subgroup 
analyses of safety in different ages, gender or race are considered meaningful.  
No new safety data for adolescents, adults or elderly were provided in the current procedure. 
2.6.8.8.  Immunological events 
The methodology for measuring ADAs (ie, anti-lanadelumab antibodies) is discussed in detail in the Clinical 
Pharmacology section. 
At baseline, no subjects in either treatment group were positive for ADAs. 
During the Overall Treatment period, 3 (15.0%) subjects were ADA positive; all of which were in the q2wks 
group and were 6 to <12 years of age. Of these, one (33.3%) subject had neutralizing antibodies on one 
occasion. For further details, please refer to Clinical Pharmacology section/Pharmacokinetic AR.   
The subject with neutralizing antibodies experienced one non-HAE attack TEAE of SMQ-defined 
hypersensitivity and 2 non-HAE attack TEAEs of injection site reactions. All three of these events resolved, 
and none of the events occurred at the time the subject tested ADA positive. 
The formation of ADAs and neutralizing antibodies had no impact on clinical outcomes, PK, PD, or the safety 
of lanadelumab over the 52-week treatment period. The three subjects who were ADA positive were attack-
free during the study, had similar lanadelumab concentrations and cleaved high molecular weight kininogen 
levels to subjects who were ADA negative, and had no differences in hypersensitivity related events or TEAEs 
from ADA negative subjects.

2.6.8.9.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific interactions are anticipated in the paediatric population. 
2.6.8.10.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no TEAEs leading to discontinuation reported in the study. 
2.6.8.11.  Post marketing experience 
Worldwide Marketing Experience 
Patient exposure is roughly estimated on the basis of worldwide sales figures and shipment data. It is 
estimated that 6,345 patient-year exposures to lanadelumab have occurred cumulatively in the post-
marketing setting since first market launch (2018) through 22 Feb 2022. 
Post-marketing Safety 
Overview of Case Reporting 
Overall, post-marketing safety data are consistent with the safety profile observed in clinical trials of 
lanadelumab. No new safety issues have been identified in the post-marketing environment. 
Adverse drug reactions from post-marketing sources were most frequently reported in the SOCs of 
congenital, familial and genetic disorders; general disorders and administration site conditions; infections and 
infestations; and injury, poisoning and procedural complications. 
Similar patterns of reporting were observed for both healthcare professional and non-healthcare (ie, 
consumer) reports. 
As with all sponsor-marketed products, the safety profile of lanadelumab is closely monitored and evaluated 
on a continual basis, as per the Risk Management Plan. 
Overview of Cases in Adults and Adolescents 
A cumulative review of cases reported from post-marketing sources up to and including 22 Feb 2022, 
identified a total of 2111 cases (3740 events) reported in adults and adolescents aged >12 years.  
Of these, 1540 events were from solicited non-interventional sources (all of which were serious), and 2200 
events were spontaneous (including worldwide competent authorities and scientific literature). Of the 2200 
spontaneous events, 247 events were serious, and 1953 events were nonserious.  
Among the serious cases, the most commonly reported events, in descending order of frequency, were HAE, 
hospitalization, and pneumonia. Among the nonserious cases, the most commonly reported events, in 
descending order of frequency were HAE, product dose omission issue, and inappropriate schedule of product 
administration. These events are primarily consistent with the clinical presentation of the underlying HAE, 
and the TEAEs observed during the clinical development program of lanadelumab.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database for the paediatric population is very limited and comprises of a total exposure of 20 
patient-years (PY); 5.6 PY with the q4W dosing and 14.5 PY with the q2W dosing. 
In total, 81% of the study population reported at least on TEAE (54% with the q4w regimen and 83% with 
the q2w regimen). The differences between the groups could reflect the discrepancy in exposure between the 
regimens and/or that the risk of injection site reactions is higher with more frequent administration.  
In Study DX-2930-03, 91% of the subjects reported at least one TEAE. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (excluding HAE attack reported events) by SOC in lanadelumab-treated 
subjects in Study DX-2930-03 were “general disorders and administration site conditions” (55% of the 
subjects), and “infections and infestations” (51%). In Study SHP643-301, the corresponding frequencies 
were 38% and 52% respectively for “general disorders and administration site conditions” and “infections and 
infestations”. However, more events were reported in the SOC “general disorders and administration site 
conditions” (6.34 events per PY), mainly representing injection site reactions.  
One single subject reported a total of 20 severe non-HAE attack TEAEs, all within the SOC of “general 
disorders and administration site conditions” and for the PT of injection site erythema. Of these events, 16 
were considered “life threatening”. Nevertheless, this subject completed study treatment. The MAH has 
clarified that according to the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Disease (DMID) Paediatric Toxicity table 
presented in appendix to protocol for SHP643-301, a local reaction larger than 50 mm is per definition 
labelled as “grade 4”, i.e., “life threatening”. 
There were no deaths, discontinuations due to adverse events or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported 
during the study. No TEAEs of hypercoagulation were reported. 
It is agreed that there were few clinically relevant changes in laboratory values during the study. However, 
many of the subjects had very similar laboratory aberrations both at screening and during the study. These 
included low creatinine, low bicarbonate, high magnesium, and high serum albumin. Low creatinine may 
reflect low muscle volume in a paediatric population with chronical illness, but the general pattern of 
laboratory chemical aberrations is not fully understood. Notwithstanding, since the laboratory aberrations 
where often seen at screening and/or before treatment Day 0, and since there were seemingly no trends in 
laboratory values over time during treatment, this is not further pursued. 
Moreover, the flagging for clinical significance made by the Investigators seems somewhat arbitrary. For one 
subject, sodium 154 mEq/L (ref 133-145 mEq/L) was flagged as clinically significant at one visit, whereas 
sodium 176, 173, and 156 mEq/L at other visits in the same subject were not. Furthermore, no low 
bicarbonate value in any subject was flagged as clinically relevant, even though levels of 9-15 mEq/L were 
reported in several subjects (ref 20-28 mEq/L). These low levels of serum bicarbonate are normally 
considered relevant in clinical praxis and medical action would normally be expected. The MAH has clarified 
that abnormal laboratory values, which were unexpected or not explained by the subject’s clinical condition, 
may have, at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor, been repeated as soon as possible until confirmed, 
explained, or resolved. Therefore, abnormal laboratory values detected in the study were not always 
reported. For example, the highly abnormal laboratory sodium 176 mEq/L and bicarbonate 9 mEq/L were 
repeated and found erroneous. 
Three subjects (14%) reported new-onset transient anti-drug antibodies (ADA), all but one with non-
neutralising antibodies at a very low titre (20). For comparison, in Study DX-2930-03, the overall incidence of 
ADA in lanadelumab treated subjects was 10 of 84 (11.9%).  
Assessment report 
EMA/440820/2023 
Page 53/64 
 
 
One subject in Study SHP643-301 had neutralising ADA at Visit 20 and non-neutralising at the next 
measurement (Visit 26). This subjects also reported one hypersensitivity TEAE and two injections site 
reactions, however not coinciding with the ADA positivity. The hypersensitivity event (eosinophils increased) 
was reported at Day 0 and all events resolved without any action taken. It is therefore agreed with the MAH 
that these events are not causally associated with positive ADA. 
Two subjects in Study DX-2930-03 (lanadelumab 150 mg q4wks arm) tested positive for low titre antibodies 
classified as neutralising. 
It is considered reassuring that all three subjects with transient ADA-positivity in Study DX-2930-03 were 
attack-free during the study, had similar lanadelumab concentrations and cleaved high molecular weight 
kininogen levels as subjects who were ADA negative, and had no differences in hypersensitivity related 
events or TEAEs from ADA negative subjects.  
No new and unexpected safety finding were identified in Study SHP643-301. Overall, the safety profile in 
paediatric subjects in Study SHP643-301 was generally consistent with that previously reported in adults and 
adolescents in the pivotal Phase 3 study and the OLE study (Studies DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04). The data 
have been reflected in section 4.8 of SmPC. 
As pointed out earlier, the safety data base for the lanadelumab treated paediatric population is very scarce, 
especially in children below the age of six years. As discussed for efficacy, extrapolation from the adult and 
adolescent populations are warranted. 
The MAH refers to the nonclinical safety studies evaluating SC administration of lanadelumab for up to 6 
months in cynomolgus monkeys and considers this to support use in the paediatric patient population aged ≥
2 to <12 years. Please refer to non-clinical discussion section for further details.   
Extrapolation of safety from adults and adolescents to the paediatric population 
The MAH provided additional argumentation for extrapolation of safety data from adults and adolescents to 
young children, based on e.g., the specificity of the antibody, data from subjects with an inborn genetic 
prekallikrein deficiency and additional non-clinical data.  
In summary, lanadelumab did not inhibit a panel of 20 different serine proteases, a class of proteases that 
includes pKal and share catalytic mechanism and key active site amino acids, at a dose three times higher 
than Cmax in adults. Furthermore, the binding of the antibody only to epitopes present in the active form of 
the enzyme (pKal) and not to prekallikrein, allowing regulation of pKal activity to generate a basal level of 
bradykinin prior to reversible binding by lanadelumab. It is agreed that this diminishes the risk of off-target 
effects of relevance for juvenile development.  
The MAH also presented data from a publication describing 111 cases of prekallikrein deficiency from 89 
families (Barco et al, 2015). Most cases of prekallikrein deficiency are not identified until adulthood and are 
incidental to testing for a different condition, for example prolonged APTT (activated partial thromboplastin 
time) without bleedings discovered during work-up prior to routine surgery. In the article, which represents 
the largest study performed on subjects with severe prekallikrein deficiency, there were no indication of any 
impact on juvenile development in this cohort which is reassuring.  
Finally, the MAH referred to the results from the non-clinical ePPND study on pre- and postnatal 
developmental toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys which showed potential exposure to lanadelumab through 
placental transfer in utero and through breast milk. There was no adverse maternal or infant findings in the 
study. This is considered to support the safety of lanadelumab in young children. Further details can be found 
in the non-clinical discussion section.  
Altogether, it is agreed that there is no indication that inhibition of kallikrein is associated with specific safety 
Assessment report

concerns in young children compared to adults and adolescents during long-term treatment. However, there 
is a need to monitor the safety in children post-approval through routine pharmacovigilance activities 
considering the very limited dataset.  
Furthermore, there were no signals indicating any safety issue associated with the various dosing regimen 
including the posology of 150 mg every 3 weeks for children weighing 10 to less than 20 kg for which the 
Cmax would be approximately 55% higher than in adults (geometric mean) with 42% of the population 
expected to exceed the 95th percentile for adults in the limited clinical data.  
In light of the above, it is considered acceptable to monitor long-term safety in children on lanadelumab 
treatment via routine pharmacovigilance.  
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No new and unexpected safety finding were identified in Study SHP643-301. Overall, the safety profile in 
paediatric subjects in Study SHP643-301 was generally consistent with that previously reported in adults and 
adolescents in the pivotal Phase 3 study and the OLE study (Studies DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04). 
As the safety data base for the lanadelumab treated paediatric population is very scarce, especially in 
children below the age of six years, there is a need to continue monitoring of safety post approval to 
characterise the safety profile in the paediatric population in particular the youngest age group through 
routine pharmacovigilance activities (i.e., adverse reactions reporting and signal detection).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
HAE is a rare hereditary disease usually beginning between 5 and 11 years of age (Farkas 2010) with 
diagnosis a couple of year later. HAE is thus even rarer in prepubertal children. Nevertheless, the historical 
mean HAE attack rate was 16 attacks during the 12 months before treatment in the paediatric study 
presented in this application, supporting an unmet medical need for routine prophylaxis also in children below 
the age of 6 years. Furthermore, albeit HAE attacks often are milder in children, the medical and social 
consequences of frequent HAE attacks in children and adolescents are large.  
Acute angioedema attacks in HAE are characterized by painful, non-pruritic swelling of the face, larynx, 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, limbs, and/or genitalia, which may last up to 5 or more days, leading to a negative 
impact on health (e.g., failure to thrive in young children with nausea due to GI-attacks) and social situation 
(e.g., social stigmata, time away from school, etc). In addition, laryngeal attacks may be life-threatening. 
The HAE attack rate is therefore considered highly clinically relevant. 
TAKHZYRO is currently indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) 
in patients aged 12 years and older. 
The scope of this procedure is to extend the indication to paediatric patients from 2 years of age. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are three categories of treatment available for subjects with hereditary angioedema (HAE): acute 
treatment of ongoing HAE attacks, pre-procedural prevention, and routine prophylaxis. Pre-procedural 
prevention is usually a single dose of medication given within 24 hours before a medical, dental, or surgical 
procedure known to increase the risk of HAE attacks, whereas routine prophylaxis is intended as long-term 
prevention. 
As per January 2023, beside Takhzyro two products, the C1-inhibitor Cinryze and the pKal inhibitor Orladeyo, 
are indicated for routine prophylaxis of HAE in the EU. For this indication, Cinryze is approved from the age of 
six years, and Takhzyro and Orladeyo from the age of 12 years.  
Assessment report 
EMA/440820/2023 
Page 57/64 
 
 
Furthermore, antifibrinolytic agents (mainly tranexamic acids) are indicated as HAE prophylaxis. In clinical 
practice, tranexamic acid seems to be mainly used in subjects in which C1-INH replacement therapy is not 
available or not approved, e.g., children and pregnant women.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical study for extending the indication to the paediatric population was Study SHP643-301. 
Study SHP643-301 was an open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre study. The main eligibility criteria were 
paediatric patients (2 to <12 years) of both sexes with a diagnosis of HAE (Type I or II) and a historical 
baseline HAE attack rate of ≥1 angioedema attack per 3 months. The baseline HAE attack rate was evaluated 
during a run-in period of 4-12 weeks. 
The main objective of Study SHP643-301 was PK, PD, and safety. Due to the limited population and the lack 
of comparator in the study, only descriptive statistics applied. 
In total, 21 subjects (2-<6 years: 4 subjects; 6-<12 years: 17 subjects) were enrolled in the study. One 
subject (age cohort 2->6 years) discontinued the study at Day 32 due to withdrawal of consent. All other 
subjects completed study and study treatment.  
The younger age cohort was administered lanadelumab 150 mg every fourth week (q4w) and the older age 
cohort lanadelumab 150 mg q2w. The Overall Treatment Period was 52 weeks. During the first 26 weeks of 
the study (Treatment Period A), all subjects were given their assigned age-based dose. During Treatment 
Period B (weeks 27-52), subjects aged 6-<12 years could switch to the q4w-dosing provided they were 
attack free for 26 weeks. Seven subjects ages 6-<12 years were administered lanadelumab q4w during at 
least a part of Treatment Period B. One subject aged 2-<6 years switched from the q4w to the q2w dosing 
after due to poor efficacy.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
There was no primary efficacy endpoint in the study. All clinical efficacy outcome endpoints were secondary 
or tertiary (exploratory) endpoints since safety and PK were the primary objectives of this open-label study.  
The main efficacy outcome (normalized number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks for the Overall 
Treatment Period) was the primary endpoint in Study DX-2930-03 performed in adults and adolescents, 
albeit with a shorter observation period (DX-2930-03: 182 days).

## Of note, the baseline observation period was up to 3 months long compared to the 364 days of the Overall 
Treatment Period. In addition, the difference in the proportion of attack-free subjects between the treatment 
arms may be explained by the switch of attack-free subjects from the q2w to the q4w dosing. 
A reduction of HAE attacks during lanadelumab treatment was reported in study SHP643-301 in all analysis 
periods. A 95% reduction of HAE attack rate (decrease in HAE attack rate from 1.84 attacks/month at 
baseline to 0.08) in the total population was reported during the Overall Treatment period (364 days). This is 
in line with the data from study DX-2930-03 in adults and adolescents, in which HAE attack rate reductions of 
84-91% (three dosing levels) were seen during 182 days. 
A similar treatment effect was seen in children in the two age cohorts 6-<12 years and 2-<6 years during the 
first 26 weeks (i.e., Day 0 through Day 182) of Study SHP643-301. A decrease in HAE attack rate from 1.84 
attacks/month at baseline to 0.10 attacks/month in the total population was observed. However, the overall 
number of subjects in the study was low. In total, 21 subjects, of which 17 were 6-<12 years and 4 were 2-
<6 years, entered the study. Furthermore, one subject (2 to<6 years of age) discontinued the study 
prematurely at day 32, leaving the 2-<6-year age cohort with only 3 subjects from Week 5.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The overarching limitation for the clinical efficacy data is the open-label, uncontrolled design of the main 
study, SHP643-301, in combination with the small sample size (21 patients), in particular in subjects below 
the age of 6 years (only 4 subjects included). Therefore, only descriptive statistics were applied. This renders 
the study largely supportive. These data are further supported by PopPK /PD data and extrapolation from 
data from the pivotal adult and adolescent study DX-2930-03. PopPK data and exposure-response analysis 
were also supportive of achieving levels of concentration similar to the adolescents and adult population. 
For children aged ≥2 years of age, it is not expected that factors other than body weight affect the 
distribution or elimination of monoclonal antibodies compared to adults. 
One limitation to the data is that only 4 children aged <5 years (10-20 kg) were included in the study; 
however, as the disease is rare, especially in children <6 years of age, it is considered acceptable to 
extrapolate below 15 kg. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In total, 81% of the study population reported at least on TEAE (54% with the q4w regimen and 83% with 
the q2w regimen). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (excluding HAE attack reported events) by SOC in lanadelumab-treated 
subjects in Study SHP643-301 were “general disorders and administration site conditions” (38% of the 
subjects), and “infections and infestations” (52%). However, more events were reported in the SOC “general 
disorders and administration site conditions” (6.34 events per PY versus 0.9 events/PY for “infections and 
infestations”), mainly representing injection site reactions.  
One single subject reported a total of 20 severe non-HAE attack TEAEs, all within the SOC of “general 
disorders and administration site conditions” and for the PT of injection site erythema. Of these events, 16 
were considered “life threatening”. Nevertheless, this subject completed study treatment. No other severe 
non-HAE attack TEAEs were reported. 
There were no deaths, discontinuations due to adverse events or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported 
during the study. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database for the paediatric population is very limited and comprises of a total exposure of 20 
patient-years (PY); 5.6 PY with the q4W dosing and 14.5 PY with the q2W dosing. The absence of a control 
group hampers assessment of causal relation of adverse events with lanadelumab.  
As for efficacy, the safety of lanadelumab treatment in the paediatric population is supported by the clinical 
data from Study SHP643-301 together with extrapolation of data from the pivotal adult and adolescent study 
DX-2930-03.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The MAH is applying for a paediatric indication including children from the age of 2 years. The application is 
based on a small clinical study (SHP643-301) and on extrapolation of efficacy and safety from adolescents 
and adults (Study DX-2930-03). 
Given the rarity of the disease in general and in the paediatric population in particular, study design and 
conduct are considered acceptable. However, the robustness of Study SHP643-301 is limited by the open-
label, uncontrolled study design and the small sample size. Due to these limitations, the study results are 
seen as supportive together with extrapolation considerations.  
The HAE attack rates during the run-in period versus during lanadelumab treatment was the primary 
endpoint in the pivotal study in the adult and adolescent population, Study DX-2930-03, and the main 
efficacy outcome in the paediatric study SHP643-301.  
A reduction of HAE attacks during lanadelumab treatment was reported in study SHP643-301 in all analysis 
periods. The magnitude of this treatment effect is considered meaningful from a clinical perspective. The 
benefit of lanadelumab in the paediatric population is further supported by the relatively large number of 
attack-free subjects that was observed across all groups during treatment. 
A similar treatment effect was seen in children in the two age cohorts 6-<12 years and 2-<6 years during the 
first 26 weeks of Study SHP643-301. However, the overall number of subjects in the study was low. 
Therefore, subgroup analyses, especially in the younger age cohort 2-<6 years, need to be interpreted with 
great caution. 
As a result, it is considered that the limited efficacy data from Study SHP643-301 is in support of a positive 
effect of lanadelumab in the paediatric population.  
In view of the scarcity of paediatric data, the rarity of the disease and the common pathogenesis of HAE 
between children and adults/adolescents, extrapolation of efficacy, based on a population PK model and 
exposure-response analysis, from the adult and adolescent populations in Study DX-2930-03 to the 
paediatric population is considered adequate and warranted to support the limited clinical data from Study 
SHP643-301.  
No new and unexpected safety finding were identified in Study SHP643-301. The safety profile in paediatric 
subjects in Study SHP643-301 was generally consistent with that previously reported in adults and 
adolescents in the Studies DX-2930-03 and the extension study DX-2930-04. Overall, the safety profile is 
considered benign and manageable. The majority of treatment emergent adverse events were in the SOC 
“general disorders and administration site conditions”, mainly representing injection site reactions. There 
were no deaths, discontinuations due to adverse events or serious adverse events reported during the study. 
As the safety dataset for the paediatric population is very scarce, especially in children below the age of six 
years, data should be interpreted with great caution. 
With regard to extrapolation of safety to the paediatric population, it is acknowledged that there is no 
indication that inhibition of kallikrein is associated with specific safety issues in young children compared to 
adults and adolescents during long-term treatment. This is also supported by the non-clinical data, and 
therefore, extrapolation of safety from the approved populations to children 2- <12 years of age is in 
principle acceptable.

Overall, the efficacy and safety results from study SHP643-301 were consistent with the results from 
adolescents and adults population in study DX-2930-03. The population pharmacokinetic (PK) model is 
generally adequate to capture and simulate the exposure in children 2-<6 years of age for extrapolation.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Clinical data from study SHP643-301 together with extrapolation of efficacy data from study DX-2930-03 are 
considered to support a beneficial treatment effect of Takhzyro on routine prevention of HAE attacks in 
children 2-<12 years of age as the posology results in similar levels of drug exposure in children and adults. 
The safety profile in study SHP643-301 was in line with study DX-2930-03 and overall considered benign. 
Nevertheless, the safety data base for the lanadelumab treated paediatric population is very scarce, 
especially in children below the age of six years. Extrapolation of safety data from adults to children could in 
principle be acceptable as the paediatric posology results in similar drug exposure as the adult posology 
Furthermore, it is not expected that the safety profile differs between children aged 2-<12 years and 
adolescents and adults. 
The MAH has implemented a dosing regimen based on weight-bands for subjects 2-<12 years of age. It is 
considered acceptable to keep the age-based posology for subjects >12 years of age since a wording 
informing on the handling of dosing when switching from paediatric to adult/adolescent posology and a notion 
that the “paediatric dosing” may also be considered as starting dose in adults and adolescents with a body 
weight <40 kg have been introduced in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Taking the totality of evidence into account, the data submitted support the approval of Takhzyro for routine 
prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema in children 2 to less than 12 years of age. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of TAKHZYRO is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of, TAKHZYRO 150 mg, solution for injection in pre-filled syringe is favourable in the 
following indication: 
TAKHZYRO is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients 
aged 2 years and older. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for TAKHZYRO subject to 
the following conditions:

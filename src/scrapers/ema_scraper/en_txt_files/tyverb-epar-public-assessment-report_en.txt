SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer-related 
death in Western Europe. The world-wide incidence of breast cancer in the year 2002 was estimated at 
1,151,298  cases;  mortality  in  the  same  year  was  estimated  at  410,712  deaths  [Parkin,  2005].  In  the 
European Union, the incidence of breast cancer is increasing, although the mortality rate from breast 
cancer has decreased in some European countries since 1990. It is estimated that in the year 2000 there 
were 350,000 new breast cancer cases in Europe, while the number of deaths from breast cancer was 
estimated at 130,000. Breast cancer is responsible for 26.5% of all new cancer cases among women in 
Europe, and 17.5% of cancer deaths. Despite improvements in early diagnosis, almost all patients with 
metastatic  disease,  and  up  to  40%  of  patients  receiving  adjuvant  therapy, eventually relapse and die 
from their disease [Ring, 2003] 
Therapeutic  approaches  to  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer  (MBC)  are  based  on  endocrine 
therapy,  biological  therapy  or  chemotherapy,  depending  on  the  hormonal  status  of  the  tumour.  The 
treatment goals in MBC are mainly to prolong survival, palliate symptoms and improve quality of life. 
Cure in MBC is rare and median survival extents between 18 and 36 months. In recent years, several 
new agents alone or in combination have contributed to the improvements in the treatment outcome, 
including taxanes, anthracyclines, antimetabolites, aromatase inhibitors, and antibodies. 
About the product: 
Lapatinib  is  a  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  which  dually  inhibits  the  growth  factor  receptors  ErbB1 
(epidermal  growth  factor  receptor,  EGFR)  and  ErbB2  (HER2).  Lapatinib  is  a  member  of  the 
4-anilinoquinazoline class of kinase inhibitors. Members of this class of molecules have been shown 
to bind to the ATP binding site of protein kinases and compete with the ATP substrate [Denny, 1996; 
Shewchuk,  2000].  This  blocks  receptor  phosphorylation  and  activation,  preventing  subsequent 
downstream signalling events. 
ErbB2  is  one  of  four  members  of  a  family  of  genes  encoding  transmembrane  receptors  for  growth 
factors, the other three being ErbB1 (EGFR or HER1), ErbB3 (HER3) and ErbB4 (HER4). There is 
evidence  in  the  literature  that  induced  overexpression  of  ErbB1  or  ErbB2  receptors  in  cells  in  vitro 
produces phenotypes associated with oncogenic transformation, such as the ability to grow in soft agar 
and formation of tumours in nude mice.  In vivo, overexpression of ErbB1 or ErbB2 has been reported 
in  a  variety  of  human  tumours  and  has  been  associated  with  poor  prognosis  and  reduced  overall 
survival in patients with cancer. Several therapeutic strategies have been employed to block the ErbB2 
signalling  pathways  as  a  means  to  improve  the  therapeutic  efficacy  of  hormonal  and  chemotherapy 
regimens.  The  rationale  for  lapatinib  use  as  an  anticancer  entity  is  that  the  blockade  of  the  tyrosine 
kinase  activity  of  ErbB1  or  ErbB2  is  expected  to  block  the  transforming  activity  that  results  from 
overexpression of these receptors. 
2.2  Quality aspects

•  Manufacture 
The  synthesis  of  lapatinib  ditosylate  is  a  multi-stage  process  including  a  final  crystallization 
purification  step.  The  process  has  been  sufficiently  detailed  including  operating  conditions  and 
quantities. 
No  quality  critical  process  parameters  have  been  identified,  but  a  number  of  quality  process 
parameters are defined. 
Adequate  specification  has  been  provided  for  all  starting  materials  (reagents,  solvents  and  auxiliary 
materials) and intermediates have been satisfactorily controlled.  
Impurities  and  degradation  products  have  been  extensively  investigated  and  fully  justified  by 
toxicological studies. 
The  chemical  structure  of  lapatinib  ditosylate  is  supported  by  the  route  of  synthesis  and  fully 
elucidated  by  1H  NMR,  13C NMR,  Mass  Spectrometry,  IR,  elemental  analysis  and  X-ray  diffraction 
analysis. 
No materials of human or animal origin have been used for the synthesis of lapatinib. 
•  Specification 
Specification  of  the  active  substance  includes  parameters  such  as  description,  identification  (IR), 
identification  of  p-toluenesulfonate  (HPLC),  assay  of  lapatinib  ditosylate  monohydrate  (HPLC), 
related  substances  (HPLC),  specific  impurity  (LC/MS/MS),  water  content  (Karl-Fischer),  residual 
solvents (GC), residue on ignition (PhEur sulfated ash), residual metals by inductively coupled plasma 
with  optical  emission  (ICP-OES).  Analytical  methods  have  been  described  and  validated  in 
accordance with ICH requirements. 
Specification  is  appropriate  and  in  accordance  with  ICH  requirements.  In  particular,  the  impurity 
limits have been justified by toxicology studies. 
Analyses of batches manufactured according to the commercial synthesis have been presented. All the 
results were found within the specification in particular for the impurities and the residual solvents.  
The  active  substance  is  stored  in  metal,  plastic  or  fibreboard  containers  lined  with  low-density 
polyethylene  (LDPE)  bags,  food-grade  quality  and  sealed  with  metal  or  plastic  ties.  The  packaging 
provides adequate protection against moisture and light during storage and transport. 
•  Stability 
In line with ICH requirements, primary production scale batches of lapatinib ditosylate monohydrate 
have  been  manufactured  and  placed  on  stability.    These  primary  batches  were  manufactured  with  a 
slightly  different  final  purification  process  than  the  commercial  one.  Batches  were  kept  in 
polyethylene  bags,  under  ICH  conditions  (36  months  at  30°C/65% RH  and  6  months  at  40°C/75% 
RH). Parameters tested were: appearance, content of lapatinib ditosylate, water content, impurities, X-
6/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ray  powder  diffraction.  Results  showed  that  no  significant  changes  could  be  observed  and  all  the 
results remained within the specification. 
Production  scale  batches  of  lapatinib  ditosylate  monohydrate,  kept  in  the  same  packaging  as  for 
primary  studies,  and  manufactured  by  the  commercial  process  have  been  placed  on  confirmatory 
stability studies.  Studies were carried out under ICH conditions (results available after 12 months at 
25°C/60% RH and 30°C/65% RH, and 6 months at 40°C/75% RH). The parameters tested were the 
following: appearance, content of lapatinib ditosylate, water content, and related substances and X-ray 
powder diffraction. No significant change could be observed after storage and all the results remained 
within the specification. 
Photostability  studies  according  to  ICH  option  2  have  been  carried  out  on  1  batch.  Lapatinib  was 
found to be sensitive to light. In addition, forced degradation studies carried out on solid state and in 
solution have shown that lapatinib was sensitive to oxidation, and hydrolysis. 
The analytical methods used during the stability studies are the same as those used for testing lapatinib 
ditosylate. 
Stability data justify the proposed re-test period when the active substance is stored at not more than 
25°C and protected from light.  
Medicinal Product 
Lapatinib 250 mg film-coated tablets contain 405 mg lapatinib ditosylate monohydrate, corresponding 
to 250 mg of lapatinib free base. The product is packaged in PA/Alu/PVC/Alu blisters.  
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
The objective was to develop an immediate release tablet with high dissolution characteristics due to 
poor water solubility.  
The pharmaceutical development has been adequately detailed. The choice of the salt (ditosylate) has 
been justified based on crystalline properties and good bioavailability. Since dissolution is considered 
a  critical  quality  attribute  because  of  its  impact  on  bioavailability,  the  particle  size  was  thoroughly 
discussed. It was convincingly demonstrated that it did not significantly impact dissolution.  
Based  on  the  active  substance  properties,  the  process  retained  was  a  fluid  bed  granulation.  The 
manufacturing process development has been described in great detail and the main focus has been on 
the critical steps granulation and compression. 
The  formulations  used  in  clinical  trials  included  the  same  excipients  as  used  in  the  final  medicinal 
product. 
The  excipients  selected  are  conventional  for  this  dosage  form.  All  the  excipients  are  compendial 
except  the  film-coating  colourants  (which  are in accordance with EC Directive 95/45/EC relating to 
colourants  used  in  foodstuffs).  The  excipients  of  the  core  tablet  are:  microcrystalline  cellulose  as 
diluent,  povidone  as  binder,  sodium  starch  glycolate  as  disintegrant,  and  magnesium  stearate  as 
lubricant. Non-compendial analytical methods have been detailed and validated. 
Certificates of analysis for each excipient have been provided. 
•  Adventitious Agents 
None of the ingredients used in the manufacture or in the composition is of human or animal origin. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  fully  described.  The  process  is  a  conventional  fluid  bed 
granulation  process  followed  by  compression  of  the  tablet  cores.  Finally,  the  tablet  cores  are  film-
coated and packaged into blisters. 
There  are  no  intermediate  products  in  the  manufacture  of  Lapatinib  film-coated  tablets,  250  mg  but 
there  are  critical  steps.  Granulation  and  compression  have  been  identified  as  critical  parameters  and 
adequate in-process controls have been applied. No overage has been used. 
7/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The manufacturing process is considered standard and has been satisfactorily validated on production 
scale batches and a process validation scheme has been included. It should ensure the consistency and 
the reproducibility of the manufacture. 
•  Product Specification 
Adequate  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  are  presented  for  the  medicinal  product  and  include 
parameters  such  as:  appearance,  identification  of  lapatinib  (HPLC,  UV),  identification  of  colorants 
(colour reactions), assay of lapatinib (HPLC), related substances (HPLC and LC/MS/MS), uniformity 
of dosage units (PhEur), dissolution (PhEur) and microbiological quality (PhEur). Tablet hardness has 
not been included in the specification and this has been justified. Impurities have been appropriately 
controlled and their limits justified by toxicological studies. 
Analytical  methods  have  been  sufficiently  described  and  non-compendial  methods  validated  in 
accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data have been provided for production-scale batches kept in the commercial packaging 
and results comply with the proposed specification demonstrating the consistency of the process. 
The  medicinal  product  is  kept  in  blisters  made  of  polyamide/aluminium/polyvinylchloride  (PVC) 
laminate  sealed  with  an  aluminium  foil  lidding  with  a  vinyl  acrylic  seal  coating.  Suitability  of 
packaging  material  was  demonstrated  during  pharmaceutical  development  and  stability  studies.  The 
packaging  materials  (in  compliance  with  Directive  2002/72/EC  and  section  3.1.11  of  PhEur)  have 
been suitably characterised and certificates of analysis provided. 
•  Stability of the Product 
Primary stability studies have been carried out on laboratory and pilot batches kept in the commercial 
packaging under ICH conditions (24 months at 30°C/65% RH and 6 months at 40°C/75% RH). 
Confirmatory  stability  studies  have  been  started  with  3  production  batches  (using  lapatinib obtained 
by the commercial synthesis) and results are available after 12 months at 30°C/65% RH and 6 months 
40°C/75% RH.  
All  results  reported  were  within  the  proposed  specification  and  no  significant  change  could  be 
observed. 
Photostability studies indicated that the product was not light-sensitive. 
Based on the stability data, the proposed shelf-life can be granted when the medicinal product is kept 
under the precautions as defined in the SPC. 
Both  primary  and  confirmatory  stability  studies  will  continue  up  to  60  months.  Three  production 
batches of Lapatinib film-coated tablets, 250 mg will be placed on long-term and accelerated stability 
studies. 
Discussion on chemical and pharmaceutical aspects 
Generally,  satisfactory  documentation  has  been  provided.  The  active  substance  lapatinib  is  well 
characterised  and  the  retained  specification  including  the  impurities  levels  have  been  justified  by 
toxicological  studies.  Lapatinib  is  stable  and  stability  data  support  the  proposed  re-test  period  of  18 
months providing that it is kept in the commercial packaging protected from light and not above 25°C.  
Regarding the finished product, the manufacturing process is a standard fluid bed granulation process. 
It  is  adequately  described  and  controlled.  It  should  ensure  a  consistent  quality  for  the  product. 
Appropriate specification has been selected for these film-coated tablets. Stability studies under ICH 
conditions  have  demonstrated  the  good  stability  of  the  finished  product.  Stability  data  support  the 
proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

2.3  Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
General  toxicity  studies  and  range  finding  studies  were  declared  by  the  applicant  to  have  been 
conducted in accordance with accepted scientific practice and in general agreement with the principles 
of  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP).    All  pivotal  safety  studies  were  stated  to  be  carried  out  in  full 
compliance with GLP regulations. 
Pharmacology 
The primary pharmacodynamic actions of lapatinib have been assessed in vitro and in vivo respect to 
treatment of various cancers. 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics 
In vitro studies 
Intracellular  domains  of  human  ErbB1  and  ErbB2  were  produced  using  the  baculovirus  expression 
system. Lapatinib was shown to inhibit phosphorylation of an exogenous peptide substrate with IC50 
values of 9.2 nM (ErbB1) and 10.8 nM (ErbB2).  Lapatinib acts as a reversible inhibitor with a slow 
dissociation  rate  (half-life  ≥300  minutes).  As  a  result  of  the  slow  dissociation  rate,  inhibition  of 
receptor phosphorylation recovered only slowly after a 4 hour treatment of ErbB1 expressing tumour 
cells  (15%  of  control  levels  at  96  hours  post-washout).  The  crystal  structure  of  the  lapatinib/ErbB1 
complex was elucidated. Lapatinib binds to the ATP binding cleft in a manner similar to that of other 
quinazoline  TK  inhibitors  (such  as  erlotinib  and  gefitinib).  Unlike  the  other  agents,  lapatinib  has  a 
bulky  aniline  substituent  that  reaches  deep  into  an  opened  back  pocket  and  the  COOH  terminal  is 
shifted to a position that partially blocks the opening of the inhibitor binding site. Thus dissociation of 
lapatinib  may  require  a  conformational  change  in  ErbB1  resulting  in  the  slow  dissociation  rate  for 
ErbB1 and ErbB2. 
The specificity of lapatinib was studied by examining the effects on 18 other protein kinases. ErbB4 
was  inhibited  with  an  IC50  of  0.36  µM  (36-fold  higher  than  for  ErbB2)  and  c-Src,  a  non-receptor 
tyrosine kinase was inhibited with an IC50 of 3.5 µM (300-fold higher). IC50 values for all other tested 
enzymes were >1000-fold than for ErbB1/ErbB2. 
A number of studies were performed to analyse the consequences of tyrosine kinase inhibition in cell 
lines, derived from both transformed and normal cells. 
• 
•  Lapatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of ErbB1 and ErbB2 as well as the downstream mediators 
Akt,  Erk1  and  Erk2  in  tumour  cell  lines  overexpressing  ErbB1  or  ErbB2.  IC50  values  were 
between 0.1 µM and 3 µM. 
In S1 tumour cells, expressing high levels of phosphorylated ErbB2, inhibition of ErbB2 tyrosine 
phosphorylation by lapatinib was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells. 
In the non-tumour cell line Hb4a, lapatinib reduced baseline phosphorylation of ErbB1 and ErbB2 
and  blocked  the  stimulatory  effect  of  EGF  on  ErbB1  tyrosine  phosphorylation.  In  the  same  cell 
line, EGF stimulated cell growth by 20% while treatment with lapatinib inhibited cell growth by 
50%. Growth inhibition by lapatinib was not reversed by EGF. 
Increased  expression  of  survivin,  an  inhibitor  of  apoptosis,  is  associated  with  poor  prognosis  in 
breast  cancer  patients.  Lapatinib  treatment  of  ErbB2-overexpressing  breast  cancer  cell  lines 
resulted in reduced levels of survivin and an increased frequency of apoptotic cells. 
• 
•  Combining lapatinib with anti-ErbB2 antibodies (polyclonal antisera or the monoclonal antibody 
trastuzumab) resulted in an additive or synergistic effect on tumour cell apoptosis. 
•  Lapatinib  retained  significant  activity  in  trastuzumab  conditioned  tumour  cell  lines,  suggesting 
non-cross-resistance between lapatinib and trastuzumab. 
9/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Chronic exposure of tumour cells to lapatinib resulted in resistance. Inhibition of estrogen receptor 
expression was associated with less resistance development. 
•  Lapatanib  inhibited  the  phosphorylation  of  the  NH2-terminally  truncated  ErbB2  receptor 
(p95ErbB2), the expression of which correlates with metastatic disease progression in breast cancer. 
•  The  effects  of  lapatinib  on  cell  growth  were  examined  in  four  human  transformed  cell  lines 
overexpressing ErbB1 and/or ErB2, one human transformed cell line overexpressing mutant Ras 
and in normal human foreskin fibroblasts. Marked inhibition of growth was noted in the four cell 
lines overexpressing ErbB1 and/or ErbB2 (BT474, HN5, N87 and Hb4a c5.2), while only minimal 
growth  inhibition  was  observed  in  the  Ras  overexpressing  cell  line  (Hb4a  r4.2)  and  human 
foreskin  fibroblasts.  It  was  also  shown  that  lapatinib  dihydrochloride  and  lapatinib  ditosylate 
monohydrate exhibited a similar growth inhibitory activity on a molar basis. 
•  A panel of 49 human normal or transformed cell lines was tested for sensitivity to lapatinib. The 
cell lines responded with IC50 values ranging from 0.025 to 11.5 µM. The most sensitive cell lines 
were derived form breast, gastric, lung and head/neck tumour tissue. 
•  Four human tumour cell lines with low levels of ErbB2 expression and a relatively weak response 
to  lapatanib  as  a  single  agent  were  tested  for  their  response  to  lapatinib  in  combination  with  5-
fluorouracil. The cell lines showed a response to the combination that was approximately additive. 
•  The two metabolites GW690006A and GSK342393A were compared to lapatinib for tumour cell 
growth  inhibition.  The  potency  of  GW690006A  was  similar  to  lapatinib  in  one  the  ErbB1 
dependent  cell  line  (HN5)  but  was  less  potent  on  the  ErbB2  dependent  cell  line  BT474. 
GSK342393A had much lower potency in all cell lines tested. 
In vivo studies

The compatibility with conventional anti-cancer therapy was investigated. Studies were conducted to

doses in combination. 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Lapatinib was examined in a standard battery of 38 various physiological receptors and ion channels. 
At 30 µM, lapatinib did not significantly (≥50%) alter the binding of any of the radioligands to their 
respective  binding  sites,  with  the  exception  of  the  sigma  receptor,  noradrenergic  and  dopamine 
transporters, and L-type calcium and sodium channel sites. At the catecholamine transporters and the 
calcium channel, the concentration-response curves of lapatinib displayed a weak binding profile with 
submaximal  inhibition  of  radioligand  binding  (<70%)  and  IC50values  of  9-26  µM.  At  the  sigma 
receptor and the sodium channel, the compound displayed typical concentration-response curves, with 
IC50 values of 1 and 3 µM, respectively. Functional activity of the compound at sigma receptors and 
sodium channels was evaluated using isolated field-stimulated guinea pig left atrial and vas deferens 
preparations, respectively. No functional activity was observed at a lapatinib concentration up to 100 
µM. 
•  Safety pharmacology programme 
Central Nervous System 
No behavioural or overt effects were observed in rats (3 females) and dogs (2 males) following single 
oral doses of 50, 150 or 500mg/kg Lapatinib leading in rats to Cmax values of 6, 10 and 27 fold the 
Cmax at clinical dose of 1250mg/day, and in dogs to 1.6, 1.8 and 3.1 the Cmax at the same clinical 
dose. 
Respiratory System 
In guinea pigs (4 males) single oral doses of Lapatinib of 50, 150 or 500mg/Kg were well tolerated 
without  effect  on  lung  compliance,  airway  resistance,  respiration  rates  or  clinical  observations.  The 
mean  Cmax  values  were  only  0.14,  0.14  and  0.27  fold  the  Cmax  to  be  obtained  with  the  proposed 
clinical dose.  With such a low exposure the value of the study is questionable. 
Cardiovascular System 
In vitro studies 
Lapatinib inhibited hERG channels in stably transfected human embryonic kidney cells with IC25 and 
IC50  values  of  0.181  and  1.11  µM,  respectively.  No  treatment-related  effects  were  noted  on  action 
potential  parameters  in  isolated  canine  cardiac  Purkinje  fibers  following  treatment  with  lapatinib  at 
concentrations  up  to  2560 ng/mL,  slightly  in  excess  of  the  expected  human  Cmax  of  2430 ng/mL.  In 
addition, no direct chronotropic effects were noted in isolated guinea pig field stimulated atria. 
In vivo studies (Rat and Dog) 
In  conscious,  telemetered  rats  and  dogs,  no  treatment-related  effects  were  noted  on  clinical 
observations, body temperature, body weights, heart rate, systemic blood pressure or tracheal inflation 
pressure  following  single  oral  doses  of  lapatinib  at  up  to  500 mg/kg  or  50 mg/kg,  respectively.  In 
addition,  there  were  no  treatment-related  effects  on  electrocardiograms  (ECG)  at  doses  up  to 
500 mg/kg  in  rats  or  dogs  (approximately  2-fold  the  human  Cmax).  Very  slight  increases  in  mean 
systolic,  mean  diastolic  and  mean  arterial  pressure  were  noted  in  dogs  at  doses ≥150 mg/kg  6  to  14 
hours after dosing while values for control and 50 mg/kg groups declined. All values remained within 
the historical control range for these parameters. Although these changes are considered very slight, 
their relationship to treatment cannot be ruled out. Maximum plasma concentrations at the 500 mg/kg 
and  50 mg/kg  doses  represent  2-fold  and  approximately  0.5-fold  the  expected  human  Cmax  of 
2430 ng/mL. No significant blood pressure changes have occurred in patients receiving lapatinib.

•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been performed that are relevant 
to the claimed indication. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics,  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  elimination  of  lapatinib  were 
investigated through a series of oral, intravenous and in vitro studies in the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and 
human  using  unlabelled  and  14C-labelled  drug.  The  concentration  of  lapatinib  in  plasma  and  serum 
samples  was  determined  using  high  performance  liquid  chromatography  with  tandem  mass 
spectrometry  (HPLC/MS/MS).  Determination  of the radiolabeled material in biological samples was 
carried  out  by  liquid  scintillation  counting  or  autoradiography.  The  profiling  and  identification  of 
metabolites  of  lapatinib  were  performed  by  HPLC  with  radiochemical  and  UV  detection,  liquid

Plasma protein binding of 14C-lapatinib was very high (>99%) in all species tested and independent of 
the concentration used. Erythrocyte binding of  14C-lapatinib was species dependent, being low in the 
mouse, rat and human (blood to plasma ratio <1) whereas in the rabbit and the dog blood to plasma 
ratio was close to 1. 
In  vitro  studies  using  Madin-Darby  canine  kidney  (MDCK)  type  II  cells  heterologously  expressing 
different efflux transporters demonstrated that lapatinib was a substrate for the human P-glycoprotein 
(Pgp, ABCB1) and murine breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp, ABCG2) transporters. Lapatinib, at 
concentrations  comparable  to  the  human  Cmax  (up  to  2.4  µg/mL  [4.1  µM]),  inhibited  human  Pgp, 
murine Bcrp and human organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1) in vitro. At a single test 
concentration of 30 µM, lapatinib inhibited human organic anion transporter (OAT) hOAT3 by 59.8% 
whereas  there  was  less  than  50%  inhibition  of  the  uptake  via  hOAT1,  hOAT2,  hOAT4,  hOCT1, 
hOCT2, hOCT2-A, hOCT3 and hURAT1. Studies using Wistar Han rats dosed with a Pgp inhibitor 
(GF120918)  or  in  Pgp-deficient  mice  indicated  that  CNS  penetration  but  not  gut  absorption  of 
lapatinib was attenuated by Pgp. 
Tissue distribution was studied using whole body autoradiography in albino and pigmented male rats 
that had received a single oral dose of 14C-lapatinib at 10 mg/kg. The absorbed radioactivity was well 
12/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distributed  into  the  tissues  in  most  instances  at  concentrations  above  that  in  blood,  with  peak 
concentrations generally at 4 hours post-dose and largely cleared from most tissues by 24 hours after 
dosing.  In  pigment-containing  tissues,  particularly  the  uveal  tract,  radioactivity  was  retained  at  168 
hours suggesting that drug-related material was bound to melanin. 
•  Metabolism 
The in vitro metabolism of 14C-lapatinib was compared in mouse, rat, monkey and human hepatocytes. 
The main biotransformations common to all of the species in 4 hour incubations were: oxidation, N- 
and  O-dealkylation  and  sulfate  conjugation.  Mouse,  rat,  monkey  and  human  hepatocytes  gave 
qualitatively similar metabolite profiles, differing primarily in the extent of metabolism. 
Metabolism of lapatinib was assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively in the plasma and excreta 
of rats (10 mg/kg), dogs (10 mg/kg), mice (30 mg/kg) and humans (250 mg) following a single oral 
administration  of  14C-lapatinib.  In  general,  14C-lapatinib  was  primarily  metabolized,  secreted  in  the 
bile  and  eliminated  in  the  faeces.  In  the  nonclinical  and  clinical  metabolism  studies,  urine  samples 
were  not  analyzed  due  to  the  low  percentage  of  the  dose  excreted  by  this  route.  In  plasma,  14C-
lapatinib  represented  the  largest  single  component  in  all  species.  Lapatinib  was  more  extensively 
metabolised in male rats than in female rats, however the metabolic profiles were similar. In dogs and 
humans, 14C-lapatinib was the only quantifiable peak present. In humans, lapatinib accounted for only 
approximately half of the radioactivity in the plasma. The remaining radioactivity was attributed to at 
least  8  metabolites  detected  by  LC-MS  but  below  the  limit  of  radiochemical  quantification  (~5%  of 
the total radioactivity in pooled plasma). These metabolites were attributed to the N-oxidation cascade 
that was also observed in vitro as well as in rats and mice. In both mice and rats, only a few of these 
metabolites  were  quantifiable  in  plasma  by  radiochemical  detection,  but  all  were  characterized  by 
mass spectrometry. Thus, no unique circulating metabolites were observed in humans 
The oxidation of  14C-lapatinib by the CYP and flavin containing monooxygenase (FMO) enzymes in 
human liver microsomes, or by individual recombinant CYPs showed that CYP3A4/5 was the primary 
route of metabolism. To a lesser extent CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19 oxidized lapatinib, while 
FMO, CYP2A6, CYP2B6 or CYP2E1 did not appear to be involved. CYP3A4 activity was inhibited 
by lapatinib by competitive as well as non-competitive mechanisms (mixed type inhibition) in human 
liver microsomes with an apparent Ki of 4 µM (2.3 µg/mL). CYP2C8 activity was also inhibited by 
lapatinib in human liver microsomes with an apparent Ki of 0.6µM (0.3 µg/mL). Lapatinib inhibited 
the metabolism of paclitaxel by CYP3A4 (Ki = 1.1 µM). Lapatinib had only a modest effect (<2-fold) 
on the microsomal half-life of docetaxel and vinorelbine.  
The potential of lapatinib to induce CYP enzymes via activation of the human Pregnane X Receptor 
(PXR)  in  a  reporter  gene  assay  was  found  to  be  low.  In  primary  cultures  of  human  hepatocytes, 
lapatinib did not increase the catalytic activity of CYP1A2, 2C9 or 3A4. 
•  Excretion 
After  administration  of  a  single  oral  dose  of  14C-lapatinib,  the  predominant  route  of  elimination  of 
drug-related  material  in  the  mouse,  rat  and  dog  was in  the  faeces, with very little urinary excretion. 
Most of the dose was eliminated within 48 hours post-dose. 
•  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
There are no non-clinical studies on drug interactions. A potential for kinetic interactions is suggested 
from the facts that lapatinib is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and 3A5, is a substrate for the human 
Pgp and murine Bcrp efflux transporters and that lapatinib at relevant human concentrations inhibits 
3A4 and other CYPs and inhibits the transporters human Pgp, murine Bcrp and OATP 1B1.

NOAEL: 10 mg/kg 
In conclusion, the repeat-dose toxicity studies have not revealed any important safety concerns others 
than what would be expected from the mode of action (epithelial effects mainly in skin and GI tract), 
effects which have been well characterised in the clinic.

Lapitinib showed no effects on mating, fertility or gonadal function in male and female rats. There was 
reduced  fetal  body  weight  and  increased  embryo-lethality  in  rats  exposed  to  lapatinib  during  early 
embryonic development. 
There were no evidence for teratogenicity from studies in rats and rabbits. Lapatinib was associated 
with growth retardation and developmental variations in rats at 4-fold clinical exposure and in rabbits 
at 8 to 23% of the clinical exposure. 
In a peri & postnatal toxicity study in rats, reduced post-natal survival and body weight was observed 
in the offspring. A non-GLP cross-fostering study showed that the lethality was due to exposure of the 
dam, while growth retardation was seen in pups which were exposed via milk.  
•  Local tolerance 
Dermal  and  ocular  irritancy  studies  were  performed  in  New  Zealand  white  rabbits,  and  skin 
sensitization  studies  were  performed  in  Hartley  guinea  pigs.  All  studies  were  performed  using  the 
ditosylate monohydrate salt of lapatinib. Lapatinib did not act as a local irritant, in the skin or in the 
eye and also did not appear to be a dermal sensitizer. 
•  Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
A sensitisation study was performed in guinea pigs. Lapatinib was not a dermal sensitiser. 
Immunotoxicity 
A study was conducted to determine the effect of lapatinib on the immune function of Wistar Han rats 
administered oral doses for 4 weeks. The rats were immunised with KLH on day 14 and the antibody 
response to KLH was determined on day 19 and day 29. No significant effect of lapatinib on the IgM 
or IgG resonse to KLH was observed. 
Other studies 
In  a  whole  body  autoradiography  study  in  rats,  radioactivity  was  retained  in  the  uveal  tract  of 
pigmented  rats,  suggesting  binding  to  melanin.  In  the  absorption  spectrum  for  lapatinib,  there  are 
peaks in the UVA/UVB region with a λmax at approximately 200 nm and smaller peaks at 260, 320 
and 360 nm. No studies have been conducted to specifically assess the photoxic potential of lapatinib. 
No ocular toxicity has occurred in studies up to 9 months duration in dogs and 6 months duration in 
albino rats.

applicable the sediment are needed. 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Lapatinib is an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase on the  growth factor receptors ErbB1 (epidermal growth 
factor  receptor,  EGFR)  and  ErbB2  (HER2).  In  vivo  lapatinib  showed  therapeutic  potential  in  the 
treatment  of  tumours  where  ErbB1  and/or  ErbB2  are  of  importance  for  tumour  growth.  Lapatinib 
showed  similar  activity  on  rat,  dog  and  human  ErbB1.  Based  on  sequence  considerations,  it  is 
predicted  that  lapatinib  binds  to  rat  and  dog  ErbB2  with  similar  potency  as  the  human  receptor. 
However, to provide further insight on the pharmacology in animal species compared to humans the 
applicant will perform measurements with recombinant rat and dog ErbB1 and ErbB2 as a follow-up 
study. Safety pharmacology studies in rats and dogs showed no important safety concerns. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  and  bioavailability  of  lapatinib  were  moderate.  There  were  no  important  differences  in 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  between  the  tested  animal  species  and  humans.  A  pronounced  gender 
difference  was  observed  in  rats,  with  higher  exposures  in  females.  This  is  likely  to  be  due  to  lower 
levels of CYP3A in female rats. 
Binding to plasma proteins was high (>99%) with no observed species differences. Lapatinib was well 
distributed  into  tissues.  Lapatinib  was  retained  in  pigment-containing  tissues,  particularly  the  uveal 
tract.  Placental  transfer  of  lapatinib  has  not  been  addressed.  Although  acceptable  for  the  current 
indication, such data are of importance for the evaluation for developmental toxicity and if lapatinib is 
developed for more benign indications, such data should be presented. 
Lapatinib  was  metabolised  mainly  by  CYP3A4/5.  No  important  differences  in  metabolism  between 
the animal species and humans were observed. No unique human metabolite was observed. Lapatinib 
was a substrate for efflux transporters (Pgp and Brp) and an inhibitor of human Pgp and murine Bcrp 
in vitro. Lapatinib also inhibited CYP3A and CYP2C8 in vitro at relevant concentrations. Lapatinib 
showed no potential for CYP induction. 
Toxicity 
The major findings in repeat dose toxicity studies were attributed to exaggerated pharmacology, most 
importantly epithelial effects in the skin and the gastrointestinal tract. These toxic events occurred at 
exposures close to the human exposure at the recommended dose. Repeat-dose toxicity studies have 
not  revealed  any  important  safety  concerns  others  than  what  would  be  expected  from  the  mode  of 
action (epithelial effects mainly in skin and GI tract), effects which have been well characterised in the 
clinic. 
Carcinogenicity studies were not considered necessary for the current indication, refractory advanced 
or metastatic breast cancer, where the life expectancy of the patient is short. However, carcinogenicity 
studies  are  currently  being  conducted  to  determine  the  tumorigenic  potential  of  lapatinib  when 
administered  by  the  oral  route  to  CD-1  mice  and  Wistar  Han  rats  and  they  will  be  provided  as  a 
follow-up measure. 
A  cross-fostering  study  showed  that  the  lethality  was  due  to  exposure  of  the  dam,  while  growth 
retardation  was  seen  in  pups  which  were  exposed  via  milk.  These  data  suggest  that  milk  from 
lapatinib-treated  mothers  may  have  negative  effects  on  the  child.  Section  5.3  of  the  SPC  warns 
regarding  use  during  pregnancy,  and  a  strong  recommendation  is  stated  against  use  during  breast 
feeding. 
No studies have been conducted to specifically assess the phototoxic potential of lapatinib. According 
to the CPMP Note for Guidance on Photosafety Testing (CPMP/SWP/3989/01), photosafety testing is 
warranted  for  those  chemicals  that  absorb  light  in  the  wavelength  of  290-700  nm  and  are  either 
topically/locally  applied  or  reach  skin  or  eyes  following  systemic  exposure.  Since  lapatinib  absorbs 
20/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
light  320  and  360  nm  and  it  has  been  show  to  be  retained  in  pigment  containing  tissues,  a  study 
program  on  photosafety  according  to  the  mentioned  guideline  will  be  provided  as  a  follow-up 
measure. 
A revised ERA presenting the PBT assessment and PEC/PNEC ratios for the aquatic, terrestrial, and if 
applicable the sediment compartment will be provided as a follow-up measure. 
2.4  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Lapatinib, in combination with capecitabine, is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced 
or  metastatic  breast  cancer  whose  tumours  overexpress  ErbB2  (HER2)  and who have received prior 
therapy  including  trastuzumab.  The  recommended  doses  of  the  combination  are:  lapatinib,  1250  mg 
once daily continuously plus capecitabine, 2000 mg/m2/day taken in 2 doses 12 hours apart on days 1-
14 in a 21 day cycle. The proposed commercial formulation of lapatinib ditosylate monohydrate is the 
same as the 250 mg tablet used in the pivotal clinical study. 
The clinical development of lapatinib includes a Phase I clinical trial in cancer patients in which the 
‘optimally  tolerated  regimen’  (OTR)  of  lapatinib  plus  capecitabine  was  identified,  two  phase  II 
monotherapy studies in breast cancer, and one pivotal Phase III study in patients with ErbB2 receptor 
over-expressing  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer,  using  the  OTR  of  the  drug  combination.  In 
addition,  the  safety  profile  of  lapatinib  as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  other  treatments  has 
been evaluated in several completed or ongoing Phase I and II studies in patients with various types of 
cancer and in healthy volunteers. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
Clinical Pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  clinical  pharmacology  studies  with  lapatinib  include  eight  studies  in  healthy  volunteers,  five 
studies in subjects with solid tumours and one study in subjects with hepatic impairment. The highest 
doses administered to healthy volunteers are single doses of 250 mg or repeated doses of 175 mg for 8 
days. Patients have received multiple doses of up to 1800 mg daily. There are no apparent differences 
in pharmacokinetics between healthy subjects and patients with cancer. 
Four different HPLC-MS/MS assays were developed and validated for the determination of lapatinib 
in plasma. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental methods. 
•  Absorption  
Absorption  has  been  evaluated  in  3  bioavailability  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  and  two  studies  in 
patients,  including  food  effect.  Lapatinib  absorption  is  characterized  by  low  solubility,  low 
permeability and affinity for intestinal efflux transporters. Oral absorption of lapatinib is incomplete 
and  variable  likely  due  to  poor  aqueous  solubility  with  peak  concentrations  occurring  on  average  4 
hours after dosing. After dosing, a lag time in absorption is observed averaging 15 minutes. 
Lapatinib  absorption  is  affected  if  administered  with  food.  A  study  performed  in  cancer  patients 
(highest  dose  tested  at  1500 mg) evaluated the effect of a low-fat as well as a high-fat meal. In this 
study, the AUC∞ was 2.67-fold higher when lapatinib was dosed with a low-fat meal, and 4.25-fold 
higher with a high-fat meal. Cmax was 2.42-fold and 3.03-fold higher, respectively. Tmax was 1.09 hours 
later and 2.53 hours later, respectively. Lapatinib bioavailability also reflects extensive metabolism in 
the gut and liver by CYP3A5 and 3A4. 
21/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The absolute bioavailability of lapatinib has not been determined because of difficulty in formulating 
the  product  for  IV  administration.  The  results  of  food  effect  studies  suggest  that  mean  absolute 
bioavailability in the fasting state must be lower than 25%. However, the variability was large. In the 
dose ranging studies, when lapatinib was administered in the fasted state, coefficient of variation (CV) 
ranged between 45% and 99% for AUC (inter-individual variability). The estimated intra-individual 
variability was 30-36% for AUC based on e.g. a bioequivalence study where repeated administration 
was performed.  
The  solubility  of  lapatinib  in  vitro  declines  dramatically  at  pH  values  above  4.  The  possibility  of 
interaction  with  proton-pump  inhibitors  (PPI)  or  histamine-2-  receptor  antagonists  (H2RA)  was 
explored  by  reviewing  concomitant  medications  reported  in  8  patients  undergoing  pharmacokinetic 
assessment. Results were not sufficient to exclude the possibility of an interaction.  
In  a  mass-balance  study,  single  250mg  doses  of  14C-labelled  lapatinib  administered  to  6  healthy 
volunteers  produced  serum  concentrations  of  radio-labelled  material  representing  parent  drug  and 
metabolites  that  peaked  4  hr  after  the  dose  and  declined  with  a  median  half-life  of  6  hr.  Plasma 
concentrations  of  lapatinib  declined  with  a  half-life  of  14  hours.  In  plasma,  lapatinib  accounted  for 
approximately 50% of radio-labelled material, the remainder being comprised of metabolites, none of 
which achieved a plasma concentration of more than 10% of parent drug.  
The ditosylate monohydrate salt has better solubility than the free lapatinib base. In an early study in 
healthy volunteers, the free base was shown to have 33% lower bioavailability than the ditosylate salt 
in  the  fasted  state.  In  the  fed  state,  however,  there  was  no  significant  difference  in  bioavailability 
between  the  salt  and  the  free  base.  Apart  from  this  early  study,  the  lapatinib  ditosylate  salt  was 
administered  in  all  clinical  studies.  The  commercial  tablet  is  the  same  formulation  as  that  used  in 
pivotal clinical trials and therefore does not require bioequivalence studies. 
•  Distribution 
The  distribution  of  lapatinib  is  influenced  by  interactions  with  several  proteins.  It  is  highly  bound 
(>99%)  to  human  serum  proteins  in  vitro  (albumin  and  α1-acid  glycoprotein).  Lapatinib  is  also  a 
substrate  and  inhibitor  of  the  efflux  transporters  P-glycoprotein  (Pgp,  ABCB1)  and  breast  cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2). 
•  Elimination 
Plasma  concentrations  of  lapatinib  decline  with  measured  half-lives  of  up  to  14  hours.  However, 
accumulation with daily dosing achieves steady-state in 6-7 days, suggesting an effective half-life of 
24 hours. In the mass-balance study, plasma and faeces samples were collected prior to dosing and for 
168 hours following dosing. Overall recovery of total radioactivity accounted for 61.6% to 99.7% of 
the dose in this study. Recovery of total radioactivity in urine accounted for less than 2% of the dose 
for all subjects. Unchanged lapatinib was not quantified in urine. Recovery in faeces accounted for a 
median of 92% (60-98%). Unchanged lapatinib in faeces accounted for a median of 27% (3-67%) of 
the dose. 
Lapatinib undergoes extensive metabolism in humans to numerous oxidated and N- and O-dealkylated 
products.  In  vitro  studies  using  human  hepatocytes  and  microsomes  indicated  that  lapatinib  is 
primarily  metabolised  by  CYP3A4  and  CYP3A5,  with  smaller  contributions  from  CYP2C8. 
Additional studies indicated that CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19 may also be involved, but to a lesser 
extent.  The  most  prominent  metabolites  are  the  carboxylic  acid  GW42393  and  the  O-dealkylated 
phenol GW690006. N-oxidation of the secondary aliphatic amine produced a cascade of about 8 minor 
metabolites.  Relative  to  parent  drug,  GW690006  produced  approximately  equipotent  inhibition  of 
ErbB1-dependent tumour cell growth in vitro, but was approximately 100-fold less potent in ErbB2-
dependent  tumour  cells.  GW342393  was  found  to  be  approximately  40-fold  less  potent  than  parent 
drug  in  both  ErbB1-  and  ErbB2-dependent  tumour  cells.  They  are  unlikely  to  contribute  to  the 
biological activity of lapatinib.

•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose-escalation  was  studied  in  healthy  volunteers  administered  with  single  doses  of  lapatinib  up  to 
250 mg. The half-life appeared to increase with dose from 6 hours at 10 mg to 9 hours at 250 mg. The 
Cmax and AUC increased in a slightly more than dose-proportional manner, with the dose-normalised 
AUC of the 250 mg dose being 1.6 times that of the 10 mg dose. In a study in patients with higher, 
multiple  Day  14  steady-state  AUCτ  and  Cmax  increased  in  a  less  than  proportional  manner  at  once 
daily as well as bid dosing. 
In a multiple-dose study in healthy volunteers, doses of up to 175 mg were administered once daily for 
8 days. Steady state was reached in 6-7 days. The increase in AUC was suggested to exceed the degree 
of  accumulation  expected  from  the  observed  half-life.  Higher  doses  were  administered  in  a  dose-
escalating study in patients with solid tumours. They received either 175-1800 mg once daily or 500-
900 mg twice daily. After once daily dosing, lapatinib appeared in plasma after lag times of up to 1.1 
hours and thereafter increased to achieve peak concentrations at medians of 3-8 hours (range 0.8-16 
hours).  Accumulation  was  observed  at  each  dose  with  geometric  mean  accumulation  ratios  ranging 
from  1.32-  to  2.42-fold.  BID  dosing  led  to  approximately  4-fold  accumulation  and  a  systemic 
exposure  that  was  approximately  2-fold  higher  than  that  observed  at  an  equivalent  total  daily  dose 
when given once daily 
Also, in a PK/PD study where cancer patients received multiple daily doses of 500 to 1600 mg, AUCτ 
increased with increasing dose in a less than proportional manner. Accumulation based on AUCτ was 
observed  at  all  doses,  with  geometric  mean  accumulation  ratios  ranging  from  1.13-  to  3.13-fold, 
indicating  an  alteration  in  pharmacokinetics  (increased  bioavailability  or  decreased  clearance)  over 
time at all doses.  
In healthy subjects, overall variability from bioequivalence studies ranged from 39 to 79%, for Cmax, 
from 31 to 90% for AUC and from 15 to 96% for Thalf. 
•  Special populations 
A specific study was performed to evaluate the effect of moderate and severe hepatic impairment on 
lapatinib  pharmacokinetics  after  a  single  dose  of  100  mg.  The  study  included  eight  subjects  with 
moderate  impairment  (Child-Pugh  7-9),  4  subjects  with  severe  impairment  (Child-Pugh  >9)  and  8 
healthy subjects. Based on comparison of log-transformed data, the exposure (AUC) increased by 56% 
and 85% in the moderate and severe impairment groups, respectively. Cmax increased in the moderate 
impairment group, but there was no effect on t1/2. In the severe impairment group there was no effect 
on Cmax, but t1/2 was prolonged. Variability was high in the severe hepatic impairment group. 
No specific studies have been performed for gender, weight, race, or elderly. Overall analysis across 
clinical pharmacology studies did not indicate an effect of any of them on lapatinib pharmacokinetics. 
Due  to  the  minor  importance  or  renal  excretion  for  the  elimination  of  lapatinib,  a  relevant  effect  of 
renal impairment on lapatinib pharmacokinetics is not expected. There is no pharmacokinetic data in 
children.

•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effects of other substances on lapatinib: 
In vitro, the major enzyme catalysing lapatinib metabolism is CYP3A4/5 with smaller contribution of 
CYP2C8 and potentially CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. Therefore, mainly CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and 
inducers  would  be  expected  to  affect  lapatinib  elimination.  Lapatinib  is  also  a  substrate  for  the 
Pgp/ABCB1  and  Bcrp/ABCG2  transporters.  Inhibitors  of  these  transporters  may  affect  lapatinib 
distribution. In addition, the metabolism of lapatinib was inhibited by docetaxel at clinically relevant 
concentrations (IC50 = 1.3 µM = 1.05 µg/mL).  
The  dependence  of  lapatinib  metabolism  on  CYP3A4  was  assessed  in  vivo  in  two  drug-drug 
interaction  studies  in  healthy  volunteers.  The  effect  of  potent  inhibition  was  examined  after 
administration of ketoconazole 200mg twice daily for 7 days, which resulted in a 3.6-fold increase in 
AUC and a 1.7-fold increase in t½ of lapatinib. Administration of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, 
was also examined when administered at 100mg twice daily for 3 days and 200mg twice daily for 17 
days.  In  this  case  lapatinib  concentrations  (AUC∞)  were  reduced  72%  after  CYP3A4  induction  by 
carbamazepine. No in vivo drug-drug interactions have been detected with concomitant therapy with 
capecitabine and trastuzumab. 
Effects of lapatinib on other substances: 
Clinically relevant concentrations of lapatinib inhibit in vitro CYP3A4 (Ki values of 1.1 to 4 µM=0.6 
to  2.3  µg/mL)  and  CYP2C8  (Ki  =  0.6  µM=0.3  µg/mL)  but  not  CYP1A2,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6  or  UGT  activity.  Lapatinib  modestly  inhibits  its  own  metabolism  by  CYP3A4.  Lapatinib 
does  not  induce  CYP  enzymes.  Lapatinib  also  inhibited  the  efflux  transporters  Pgp/ABCB1  (IC50  = 
3.91 µM=  2.3 µg/mL)  and  Bcrp/ABCG2,  and  the  hepatic  uptake  transporter  OATP  1B1  (IC50  = 
4.02 µM=  2.3  µg/mL).  At  a  single  test  concentration  of  30  µM,  lapatinib  inhibited  human  organic 
anion transporter (OAT) hOAT3 by 59.8%. 
Pharmacodynamics 
•  Mechanism of action 
No clinical studies investigating the mechanism of action have been conducted. 
•  Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Biological activity in terms of inhibition of ErbB1/2 activation and down stream signalling has been 
demonstrated  in  tumour  biopsies  from heavily pre-treated patients. No obvious relationship between 
dose/concentration  and  biological  activity  was  identified,  but  the  sample  size  was  small  and  the 
population heterogeneous. Despite signs of biological activity, the response rate was low. 
A relatively extensive biomarker programme is underway, but until now no markers predictive of anti-
tumour activity or resistance to lapatinib have been identified. 
From a repeat-dose dose finding study combining capecitabine and lapatinib including 45 patients, the 
recommended  phase  III  dose  was  lapatinib  1250  mg/d  OD  and  capecitabine  1000  mg/m2/day  BID 
14/21 days. The dose-limiting toxicity was determined to be diarrhoea and rash. An additional study 
including  patients  with  breast  cancer  and  other  solid  tumours  was  also  pertinent  for  the  analysis  of 
dose-response. A total of 81 subjects were randomized in this study and received at least one dose of 
lapatinib. In this study once daily administration of lapatinib at doses ranging from 175 to 1800 mg 
resulted in approximately a 2-fold accumulation, while twice daily administration of lapatinib at doses 
ranging from 500 to 900 mg resulted in approximately 4-fold accumulation. Systemic exposure was 
approximately 2-fold higher after twice daily dosing compared to once daily dosing at the same total 
daily dose.  
24/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  skin  and  the  intestinal  mucosa  were  the  main  non-tumoral  targets  for  lapatinib  action,  with 
diarrhoea being prominent as dose-limiting in dose-finding studies. 
Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology 
Discussion on clinical PK 
Lapatinib  displays  high  pharmacokinetic  variability,  which  is  not  unexpected  considered  the 
physicochemical properties and the different mechanisms involved in its absorption and elimination. 
Administration of lapatinib with food results in an average 3- to 4-fold increase in systemic exposure 
at  clinically  relevant  doses.  This  increase  appears  to  be  positively  related  to  the  fat  and/or  caloric 
content  of  the  meal.  A  further  pharmacokinetic  study  will  be  provided  as  a  follow-up  measure  to 
characterise  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lapatinib  administration  according  to  the  currently  proposed 
recommendations with different types of meals. Until results are available, it is agreed to maintain the 
recommendation  that  lapatinib  should  be  taken  1  hour  before  or  1  hour  after  food  and  it  has  been 
properly stated in section 4.2 of the SPC. A warning of possible interactions with food and drink has 
also been included in section 4.5 of the SPC. 
The  solubility  of  lapatinib  is  pH-dependent,  but  no  clinical  study  has  been  performed  to  evaluate 
whether  changes  in  gastric  pH  due  to  anti-acidic  treatment  may  alter  lapatinib  bioavailability.  The 
Applicant  has  committed  to  perform  a  study  as  a  follow-up  measure;  until  results  are  available  a 
warning has been included in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC. 
From  the  mass  balance  study  it  is  apparent  that  biliary  excretion  plays  an  undetermined  role.  The 
recovery of unchanged lapatinib in faeces may be due mainly to biliary excretion of unchanged parent 
compound  rather  than  to  incomplete  absorption,  which  seems  plausible.  Biliary  excretion  may 
therefore be a relatively important route of elimination for lapatinib. 
It  has  not  been  considered  possible  to  give  clear  dose  adjustment  recommendations  based  on  the 
results of the study in hepatic impairment. That study was performed at a much lower dose than the 
proposed  dose  for  Tyverb  and,  due  to  non-linear  pharmacokinetics,  the  results  of  the  study  (i.e.  the 
observed  increase  in  exposure)  cannot  readily  be  extrapolated  to  the  clinical  dose.  There  was  also a 
large  variability  in  the  study,  as  will  be  expected  also  in  clinical  practice  due  to  different  types  of 
heptatic disease. The impact of the type of hepatic impairment (e.g. metabolic impairment, cholestasis 
etc.) and whether the included subjects had hepatic disease that would be expected to have a marked 
effect on lapatinib pharmacokinetics have not been addressed. 
Lapatinib pharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in patients with renal impairment or in 
patients  undergoing  haemodialysis.  Available  data  suggest  that  no  dose  adjustment  is  necessary  in 
patients with mild to moderate renal impairment however caution is advised if lapatinib is prescribed 
to patients with severe renal impairment as stated in section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SPC. 
Lapatinib is a substrate for the transport proteins Pgp and BCRP and has been shown to inhibit both of 
them  in  vitro  as  well  as  the  hepatic  uptake  transporter  OATP1B1.  Inhibitors  (ketoconazole, 
itraconazole,  quinidine,  verapamil,  cyclosporine,  erythromycin)  and  inducers  (rifampin,  St  John’s 
Wort)  of  these  proteins  may  alter  the  exposure  and/or  distribution  of  lapatinib.  A  warning  has  been 
included in section 4.5 and 5.2 of the SPC. 
Due  to  lapatinib  inhibitory  effect  on  CYP3A4,  coadministration  of  lapatinib  with  strong  CYP3A4 
itraconazole,  voriconazole, 
inhibitors  (e.g.  ritonavir,  saquinavir, 
posaconazole,  nefazodone)  or  inducers  (e.g.  rifampicin,  rifabutin,  carbamazepine,  phenytoin  or 
Hypericum  perforatum  [St  John’s  wort])  should  be  avoided.  Coadministration  of  lapatinib  with 
moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 should proceed with caution and clinical adverse reactions should be 
carefully monitored. A warning has been included in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC. 
telithromycin,  ketoconazole, 
The  Applicant  has  suggested  making  a  dose  recommendation  if  concomitant  use  of  a  CYP3A4 
inhibitor cannot be avoided, and that the dose should be monitored based on tolerability. The latter is, 
25/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
however, not considered possible for the currently indicated patient population, since lapatinib should 
be co-administered with capecitabine, which has overlapping toxicity. It might therefore be difficult to 
identify  potential  under-  or  over-exposure  of  lapatinib  at  a  decreased  dose.  Moreover,  the 
ketoconazole interaction study was performed with a dose of lapatinib within the low dose range (100 
mg)  where  non-linearity  was  in  the  opposite  direction  compared  with  at  higher  doses,  and  the 
magnitude  of  the  effect  might  possibly  be  different  at  the  clinical  dose.  The  effect  of  different 
inhibitors  might  be  highly  variable.  The  proposed  recommendation  has  not  been  tested,  and  the 
variability  in  the  resulting  exposure  is  unknown.  Thus,  combination  with  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors 
should be avoided.  
The effect of 1500 mg OD lapatinib on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam administered orally and 
intravenously will be provided. The final clinical study report for this study is planned for completion 
in  June  2008.  Preliminary  results  indicate  that  lapatinib  decreased  midazolam  clearance  18%  and 
increased midazolam bioavailability 19%, resulting in AUCIV increasing 22% after IV and 45% after 
PO  administration.  Based  on  these  findings,  co-administration  of  lapatinib  with  drugs  that  are 
substrates of CYP3A4 and have narrow therapeutic windows should be undertaken with caution. This 
is addressed in Section 4.5 of the SPC. 
Clinical efficacy  
The  main  clinical  efficacy  trial  was  a  phase  III  trial  comparing  lapatinib  in  combination  with 
capecitabine with capecitabine alone in the treatment of women with ErbB2 overexpressing advanced 
or metastatic breast cancer who had received prior anthracyclines, taxanes and trastuzumab. 
•  Main study  
Study EGF100151 
This was a phase III, randomized, open-label, multicentre study comparing lapatinib plus capecitabine 
versus capecitabine alone in women with ErbB2 overexpressing advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
who had received prior treatment with anthracyclines, taxanes and trastuzumab. 
METHODS 
Study Participants 
The key inclusion criteria were: 
1.  Histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IIIb or stage IIIc with T4 lesion, or 
stage IV disease. Subjects were required to have measurable disease as defined by RECIST, an 
Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1 and a life expectancy 
of ≥12 weeks. 
2.  ErbB2 overexpression (immunohistochemistry IHC 3+ or IHC2+ with fluorescence in situ 
hybridization FISH confirmation). 
3.  Documented progressive advanced or metastatic breast cancer, defined as appearance of any new 
lesion or increase of 25% or more in existent lesions.  
4.  Refractory breast cancer defined as progression or relapse within 6 months of completing adjuvant 
therapy. Prior therapies must have included, but were not limited to anthracyclines, taxanes and 
trastuzumab. Prior treatment with capecitabine was not permitted. 
The  study  was  conducted  by  246  investigators  at  128  centres  in  the  following  countries:  Argentina, 
Australia,  Brazil,  Canada,  Finland,  France,  Germany,  Greece,  Hong  Kong,  Ireland,  Israel,  Italy, 
Poland,  Portugal,  Russia,  Republic  of  South  Africa,  Spain,  Switzerland,  United  Kingdom,  and  the 
United States.  
26/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatments 
Subjects  were  randomized  to  one  of  two  treatment  groups,  to  receive  either  lapatinib  1250mg/day 
daily  continuously  and  capecitabine  2000mg/m2/day  on  Days  1-14  of  a  21-day  treatment  cycle  or 
single-agent capecitabine 2500mg/m2/day on Days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle.  
Treatment was administered until disease progression or withdrawal from study due to unacceptable 
toxicity or other reasons. Treatment could have been delayed up to 2 weeks or a single reduction in the 
lapatinib  dose  was  allowed  to  1000 mg/day  to  allow  for  resolution  of  toxicity.  A  delay  for  up  to  2 
weeks and dose reductions to 50% of the starting dose were also permitted for capecitabine. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  and  compare  time  to  progression  (TTP)  in  subjects  with 
refractory  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  treated  with  lapatinib  and  capecitabine  versus 
capecitabine alone. 
Secondary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  and  compare  the  two treatment arms with respect to: Overall 
survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (complete and partial responses), 
clinical  benefit  response  rate  (complete  response,  partial  response  or  stable  disease  for  at  least  6 
months) and change in quality of life (QOL) status. They also included comparison of the qualitative 
and  quantitative  toxicity,  comparison  of  the  tumour  response  rates  and  on-treatment  serum 
concentrations of ErbB1 and ErbB2, to further characterize the patient population by determination of 
intra-tumoral  expression  of  ErbB1,  ErbB2  and  downstream  biomarkers  and  to  determine  the  intra-
tumoral  genetic  changes  (i.e.,  mutations,  copy  number  variability,  expression  levels)  that  may 
correlate with response to lapatinib. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Time to progression (TTP, disease progression or death due to breast cancer prior to progression), was 
established  by  an  independent  review  committee  (IRC),  who  were  blinded  to  study  treatment,  after 
radiological assessment including a chest CT (or MRI) scan including liver or alternatively, separate 
chest  and  abdominal  CT  (or  MRI)  scan  and  a  bone  scan.  As  secondary  assessment,  physicians 
involved in the trial also evaluated the subject’s tumour response/disease status. Pelvic scan and MRI 
(CT) of the head were performed when clinically indicated. 
Radiographic  disease  assessments  were  obtained  every  6  weeks  for  the  first  24  weeks,  followed  by 
every  12  weeks  (within  7  days  +/-  window)  or  sooner  if  clinically  indicated.  The  same  physician 
evaluated  the  subject’s  tumour  response/disease  status  when  possible.  If  the  lesion(s)  noted  at 
screening were not evaluated at the end of the efficacy evaluation interval, this will be noted as ‘not 
done’ (ND) in the CRF. 
The response confirmation requirements were a confirmatory disease assessment no less than 4 weeks 
after the criteria for response are first met, a disease evaluation (e.g. radiologic, medical photography) 
on all sites with lesions present at the baseline assessment, and a bone scan to rule out the presence of 
new bone lesions or progression of existing bone lesions. 
The clinical benefit response rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with evidence of complete 
or partial tumour response or stable disease for at least 6 months (24 weeks). 
For  subjects  who  had  CR  or  PR,  the  duration  of  response  was  defined  as  the  time  from  first 
documented evidence of PR or CR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due 
to breast cancer. 
Sample size 
The study was originally designed with 90% power and Type I error of 0.05 to detect a 50% increase 
in  median  TTP  in  subjects  who  received  lapatinib+capecitabine  assuming  a  median  time  to 
progression of 3 and 4.5 months in the capecitabine and lapatinib plus capecitabine arms, respectively. 
The study was subsequently amended so it was also powered to detect a difference in overall survival 
(a  secondary  study  endpoint).  A  maximum  of  457  deaths  were  required  for  the  analysis  of  overall 
27/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
survival to have an 80% chance of successfully detecting a 30% increase in median survival time in 
subjects  who  received  lapatinib  plus  capecitabine,  based  on  median  survival  times  of  8  and  10.4 
months  in  the  capecitabine  and  lapatinib  plus  capecitabine  arms,  respectively,  i.e.  a  hazard  ratio  of 
0.769. To achieve the 80% power an estimated total of 528 subjects would have been required. 
Randomisation 
Subjects  were  randomized  to  receive  lapatinib  plus  capecitabine  or  capecitabine  alone  and  were 
assigned to study treatment in accordance with a 1:1 randomization schedule. 
Randomization was stratified according to three categories based on stage and site of disease: 
(cid:131)  Disease Stage IIIb or IIIc with T4 lesions; 
(cid:131)  Disease Stage IV / Visceral site (any visceral); and 
(cid:131)  Disease Stage IV / Non-visceral site. 
Blinding (masking) 
No blinding performed (open-label study). 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  population  for  the  analysis  of  the  efficacy  results  was  the  Intent  to  Treat  (ITT) 
population,  which  included  all  randomized  subjects  whether  they  received  study  medication  or  not. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) population was composed of all randomized and treated subjects who had no 
major protocol deviations. The PP population was used to provide a supplementary analysis of time to 
progression only. 
The  Safety  population  was  composed  of  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
randomized therapy and was based on the actual treatment received, if this differed from that to which 
the subject was randomized. 
For TTP, there were a maximum of two interim analyses planned, to occur at approximately equally 
spaced  numbers  of  events:  133  and  266  investigator-determined  events.  O'Brien-Fleming  stopping 
boundaries  with  one-sided  2.5%  significance  level  were  used.  All  p-values  presented  are  two-sided 
unless otherwise stated.

Patients were enrolled between the 29th March 2004 and the 3rd April 2006. The interim analysis was 
performed after 146 investigator-identified events (321 subjects) (disease progression or death due to 
breast cancer prior to progression) were observed with a clinical cut-off date of 15 November 2005. 
The independent review committee (IRC) who were blinded to study treatment identified 114 events. 
As the primary analysis of TTP was based on events determined by the IRC, the power of the interim 
analyses  was  decreased.  As  a  result  of  the  lower  number  of  events,  new  O'Brien-Fleming  stopping 
boundaries were calculated based on 114 events and one-sided p-values - the futility boundary for 114 
events was crossed if the log-rank test resulted in p ≥0.4516, (for 133 events, the futility boundary was 
crossed  if  p  ≥0.3308)  and  the  superiority  boundary  for  114  events  was  crossed  if  the  log-rank  test 
resulted in p ≤0.0014, (based on 133 events, the boundary for superiority was crossed if the log-rank 
test resulted in p≤0.0028). 
After  review  by  the  Independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (IDMC)  the  applicant  was 
recommended  to  halt  further  enrolment  into  the  study.  GlaxoSmithKline  decided  to  terminate  study 
enrolment  and  subjects  in  the  control  arm  were  given  the  opportunity  to  cross-over  and  receive  the 
combination of lapatinib and capecitabine. 
After the interim analysis there have been three further database freezes as summarized in Table 8: 
Table 8 - Database freezes for Study EGF100151 
Conduct of the study 
There were in all 7 amendments to the protocol. None of them constitutes a concern as regards study 
integrity.  
Major  protocol  deviations  occurred  in  17  (10%)  patients  in  the  experimental  arm  and  in  31  (19%) 
patients in the control arm. No major imbalances were detected between arms on this regard. Due to a 
technical  problem  with  the  randomization  system,  seven  subjects  were  randomized  to  the 
lapatinib+capecitabine  group  but  received  capecitabine  monotherapy  and  nine  subjects  were 
randomized to the capecitabine group but received lapatinib+capecitabine (see Table 12).

•  Secondary endpoints: 
Progression Free Survival (PFS) 
At the cut-off point for interim analysis (15 November 2005), the independently assessed median time 
for  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  was  36.7  weeks  in  the  lapatinib+capecitabine  group  and  17.9 
weeks in the capecitabine group; hazard ratio of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.67, p-value: 0.000023) 
Up  to  3  April  2006  the  independently  assessed  median  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  was  27.1 
weeks  in  the  lapatinib+capecitabine  group  and  17.6  weeks  in  the  capecitabine  group  with  a  hazard 
ratio of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.74, two-sided p=0.000033).  
Sensitivity  analyses  fell  in  between  the  results  reported  by  IRC  and  investigators.  Results  from  the 
“Earliest Date” analysis are shown in Table 14. The median difference is 5.8 weeks, which is a likely 
underestimate since the median difference is about 6 weeks in the investigator analysis. 
Table 14 - Progression-free Survival, Independent review (ITT Population, 3 April 2006) 
Response Rate (RR) 
At the cut-off point for interim analysis (15 November 2005), independently reviewed response rate 
(complete  or  partial  response)  was  22%  in  the  lapatinib+capecitabine  group  versus  14%  in  the 
34/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
capecitabine group. The odds ratio was 1.7 (95% CI: 0.9, 3.2, p-value: 0.091). This compares to the 
investigator  assessment  of  response  rate  for  the  lapatinib+capecitabine  group  (29%)  and  the 
capecitabine group (17%). This odds ratio was 2.1 (95% CI: 1.2, 3.7; p-value: 0.011)  
Up to 03 April 2006, independently reviewed response rate (complete or partial response) was 24% in 
the lapatinib+capecitabine group versus 14% in the capecitabine group. The odds ratio was 1.9 (95% 
CI: 1.1, 3.4, p=0.017). 
Overall Survival 
The results of overall survival analysis at 4 different cut-off time points are shown in Table 15. At the 
time of the latest analysis (28 Sept 2007), 148 subjects (71%) in the lapatinib+capecitabine group and 
154  subjects  (77%)  in  the  capecitabine  group  had  died.  At  this  time  point  25%  of  subjects  in  the 
lapatinib+capecitabine group and 20% of subjects in the capecitabine group were still being followed 
for  survival  and  were  censored  for  these  analyses.  In  addition,  3%  of  subjects  in  the  both  the 
lapatinib+capecitabine group and the capecitabine group were no longer being followed for survival 
but were alive when their follow-up ended.

Clinical Benefit Rate 
Using the independent assessment a greater proportion of subjects in the lapatinib+capecitabine group 
(29%)  than  in  the  capecitabine  group  (17%)  achieved  clinical  benefit  (odds  ratio:  2.0,  95%  CI:  1.2, 
3.3,  two-sided  p-value:  0.008;  cut-off  date  3  April  2006).  Using  the  investigator  assessment  of  the 
clinical  benefit  response  rate  a  greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  lapatinib+capecitabine  group 
(37%) than in the capecitabine group (21%) achieved clinical benefit (two-sided p-value: 0.001).  
Duration of Response 
For  subjects  who  responded  to  treatment,  the  median  duration  of  response  was  32.1 weeks  in  the 
lapatinib+capecitabine group and 30.6 weeks in the capecitabine group (cut-off date 3 April 2006) 
Ancillary analyses 
1.  Cox regression analyses on overall survival 
A stepwise model-building approach using Cox Regression was employed to evaluate the effects of 
baseline disease history and prognostic factors on the overall survival (see Table 16). Treatment was 
retained in the model, while the prognostic factors (number of sites of disease, ECOG performance 
status and liver metastases) were evaluated using stringent criteria for inclusion using entry/exit 
criteria of α ≤ 0.05.

Terms Including Liver Metastases ITT Population (15 March 2007)

The same prognostic covariates identified were included in Cox regression analyses using the three 
cut-off datasets (see Table 17). 
Table 17 - Comparison of Cox Regression Survival Analyses Over Time 
2.  Analyses addressing the effect of cross-over 
Out of 39 patients “at risk” for cross over, a total of 36 patients did cross over from monotherapy to 
combination  therapy  after  April  2006.  Of  these  36  patients,  (at  least)  29  crossed  over  prior  to 
progression on monotherapy. Median time to cross-over was 17.8 weeks to be compared with time to 
progression being 18.6 weeks in the capecitabine arm (IRC). 
In order to address the possible confounding effect of cross-over different approaches were undertaken 
by  the  sponsor  (censoring  of  cross-over  patients  at  baseline,  at  time  of  cross-over,  or  as  time-
dependent covariate) (See Figure 3):

Over (ITT Population, 28th September 2007) 
3.  Effect of next-line therapies 
Other  subsequent,  ‘next-line’  anticancer  therapy  was  received  by  277  subjects  (141  subjects  treated 
with  lapatinib  +  capecitabine  and  136  subjects  treated  with  capecitabine).  Administration  of  these 
subsequent  therapies  was  balanced  between  the  two  treatment  groups.  Trastuzumab-containing 
regimens  (monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  vinorelbine,  taxanes,  gemcitabine,  bevacizumab, 
capecitabine, or cisplatin) were the most common next-line regimens in follow-up treatment (26% of 
patients  randomised  to  lapatinib  +  capecitabine,  and  21%  patients  randomised  to  capecitabine).  The 
next most common regimens for first follow-up treatment were vinorelbine, gemcitabine, capecitabine, 
hormonal  agents,  anthracycline,  and  taxanes.  Other  treatments  included  radiotherapy,  surgery, 
experimental agents, CMF, liposomal doxorubicin, carboplatin, and cisplatin, either as monotherapy, 
or in combinations other than with trastuzumab. 
4.  Q-TWiST analysis 
There  was  no  significant  difference  between  groups  in  mean  duration  of  grade  3/4  AEs  prior  to 
progression (lapatinib + capecitabine 1.7 weeks, capecitabine 1.5 weeks). A threshold utility analysis 
(using utility weights of 0.5 for both TOX and REL, i.e. counting 2 days of TOX or REL as equivalent 
to  1  day  of  TWiST)  resulted  in  a  clinically  meaningful  difference  in  quality-adjusted  survival 
favouring  lapatinib  +  capecitabine  (p=0.0013)  of  approximately  7  weeks.  The  Q-TWiST  difference 
was significant across a broad range of possible utility weights and results were robust in sensitivity 
analyses including all AEs or only treatment-related AEs.

EGF30001: Lapatinib plus Paclitaxel in First-Line Metastatic Breast Cancer 
A multicentre, multinational, double-blind Phase III study of lapatinib plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel 
alone in the first-line treatment of subjects with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) whose ErbB2 receptor 
status  at  entry  was  either  unknown  or  negative.  Subjects  were  randomised  to  paclitaxel  175  mg/m2 
q3w and oral lapatinib 1500 mg OD or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 q3w and placebo OD. Preliminary data 
are shown in Table 18:

Table 18 - Efficacy Data in ErbB2+ Population 
EGF105084: Lapatinib Therapy in Patients with Brain Metastases 
This study was a phase II single-arm, open-label, multicentre trial of lapatinib monotherapy (750 mg 
BD)  in  patients  with  recurrent  brain  metastases  from  ErbB2-positive  breast  cancer.  Eligible  patients 
had  radiographic  evidence  of  progressive  brain  metastases  at  study  entry,  and  had  received  prior 
trastuzumab and cranial radiotherapy. All subjects had undergone prior cranial radiotherapy, received 
extensive  prior  systemic  therapy,  and  must  have  had  radiographic  evidence  of  CNS  disease 
progression  upon  study  entry.  A  total  of  242  patients  were  enrolled.  High  resolution  brain  MRI 
scanning was performed every 8 weeks to precisely measure the volume of the tumours in the brain. 
At  disease  progression  with  lapatinib  monotherapy,  patients  could  continue  into  an  extension 
treatment arm and receive lapatinib + capecitabine (the same regimen as used in study EGF100151). 
Altogether 16/242 (monotherapy) and 10/49 (combination) experienced ≥ 50% volumetric reduction. 
PFS data is shown in Table 19: 
Table 19 - Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) (Study EGF105084) 
Study EGF103659 and the ATU (Authorisation Temporaire d’Utilisation) in France 
These studies were started after enrolment to EGF100151 was stopped. Both used the same lapatinib + 
capecitabine  regimen  as  in  EGF100151,  and  patient  eligibility  criteria  were  similar.  Globally, 
EGF103659 has enrolled 2570 patients at 198 sites and in Europe, the study is being conducted in 27 
countries and has enrolled 1137 patients (September 2007). The French ATU has enrolled 760 patients 
in 250 sites (to the same cut-off date). 
Of 1189 patients enrolled at these sites, 137 (12%) entered EGF103659/ATU with brain metastases at 
baseline.  Data  regarding  progressive  CNS  metastases  upon  entry,  method  of  CNS  evaluation,  dates 
and  response  of  CNS  evaluations,  dates  and  response  of  any  non-CNS  disease,  presence  of  tumour 
related neurological symptoms at entry, and change in symptomatology were collected. The results are 
shown in Table 20: 
38/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 20 - Best Response for EGF103659 / ATU Subjects with Progressive CNS Metastases at 
Baseline 
There were 92 subjects with available treatment start date and date of response assessments, for whom 
the  median  time  on  treatment  was  13  weeks  (range:  1  week  to  107  weeks).  Of  these  92  subjects, 
treatment  is  ongoing  for  54  (59%)  subjects.  For  reference,  the  median  duration  of  therapy  with 
lapatinib + capecitabine therapy in EGF100151 was 19 weeks with 23% of subjects on therapy at the 
time  of  the  analysis  (03rd  April  2006  data  set).  In  addition,  improvement  in  neurological  signs  and 
symptoms  (NSS)  was  observed  in  at  least  one  quarter  of  subjects,  with  few  subjects  requiring  an 
increase in steroids. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This  submission  relies  on  a  single  pivotal  Phase  III  randomised,  open  label,  active  controlled  trial 
conducted  in  breast  cancer  patients  with  good  performance  status,  essentially  normal  cardiac,  renal 
and hepatic function. Patients eligible for enrolment were ErbB2 over-expressing, locally advanced or 
metastatic  breast  cancer,  progressing  after  prior  treatment  that  included  taxanes,  anthracyclines  and 
trastuzumab. 
The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP) as assessed by an independent review panel. The 
study was halted based on the results of a pre-specified interim analysis that showed an improvement 
in  TTP  (51 %  reduction  in  the  hazard  of  disease  progression)  for  patients  receiving  lapatinib  plus 
capecitabine. Various estimates of treatment effect are available, according to different adjudications 
(investigator, IRC) and analysis updates. Estimates based on IRC assessment are likely to overestimate 
the  difference  between  study  arms  in  terms  of  TTP  due  to the consequences of non-confirmation of 
investigator assessed events of progression and absence of follow-up imaging. A reasonable estimate 
in terms of HR and based on several sensitivity analyses is most likely slightly below 0.7 and about 6 
to 8 weeks difference in median time to progression. 
Generally, when survival is expected to be short and if there are no evidence-based next-line therapies 
available, confirmatory studies should be designed to show a survival benefit. The pivotal study was 
designed to demonstrate a survival benefit but as a secondary endpoint. Due to premature termination 
of  enrolment  based  on  the  first  interim  analysis  of  PFS,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  whether  the 
combination  of  lapatinib  plus  capecitabine  is  significantly  different  from  capecitabine  in  terms  of 
overall survival. An updated analysis of the overall survival data to 28 September 2007 (proportion of 
events observed >70%) indicated that there was a trend to improved survival in the combination arm. 
The median overall survival was 74.0 weeks in the lapatinib + capecitabine group and 65.9 weeks in 
the  capecitabine  alone  group  (Hazard  Ratio:  0.9  [95 % CI:  0.71,  1.12]).  No  bias  related  to  next line 
therapies  was  identified  and  cross-over  to  lapatinib  appeared  unlikely  to  constitute  a  major 
confounding factor. In this patient population however, the expected median survival in the reference 
arm (8 months according to the protocol), turned out to be about 20 weeks longer and time to death 
after  progression  about  40  weeks  longer.  Longer  survival  after  progression  might  reflect  a  longer 
effect of previous trastuzumab therapies. 
In  addition,  a  reduced  incidence  of  CNS  metastases  has  been  observed  in  secondary  analyses  in the 
pivotal  study  which  was  just  statistically  significant  although  no  clear  effect  was  seen  in  other 
39/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analyses.  On  the  combination  arm,  there  were  9/207  (1.5  %)  progressions  in  the  central  nervous 
system as first site of progression as compared with 18/201 (9.0%) progressions on the capecitabine 
alone  arm  (investigator  assessment,  cut-off  date  of  March  2007).  There  is  a  need  to  prospective 
confirmation of the effect on reducing the incidence of CNS metastases. 
Clinical safety 
The  Safety  population  was  composed  of  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
randomized therapy and was based on the actual treatment received, if this differed from that to which 
the subject was randomized.

•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The SAEs related to study medication are summarized for Study EGF100151 in Table 25 (for a cut-off 
3 April 2006). Preliminary SAE data are available from the lapatinib clinical programme (all phases) 
up to a cut-off date of 30 April 2007. No significant changes were found at this later cut-off, where a 
total  of  7859  subjects  were  enrolled  in  phase  I,  II  and  III  studies  (approximately  5975  subjects 
receiving lapatinib). This figure is approximate since some studies are ongoing and remain blinded. A 
total  of  2986  SAEs  were  reported  from  1595  individual  subjects  (see  ten  most  frequently  reported 
drug-related SAE in Table 26).

program (cut-off date of 30 April 2007) 
. 
Deaths 
Deaths  within  30  days  of  the  last  dose  were  reported  for  11  (6%)  subjects  in  the  lapatinib  plus 
capecitabine  group  and  12  (6%)  subjects  in  the  capecitabine  group  (up  to  the  3  April  2006  cut-off 
date). 
Hepatic safety 
From a combined dataset of clinical trials and post-marketing data, there were 216 reports of hepatic 
events retrieved from the GlaxoSmithKline safety database as of 31 December 2007. A total of 11551 
subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  lapatinib  clinical  trials  programme,  of  which  it  is  estimated  that  8702 
subjects had received lapatinib and exposure to marketed products was estimated as 1318 patient-years 
as of September 2007, based on a 1250 mg daily dose. From the resulting subset of assessable reports, 
39 ‘key’ cases were identified (see Table 27 for a summary of reasons for exclusion). This yields an 
approximate incidence of 0.4% (32/8702) of hepatobiliary events in the lapatinib clinical programme 
and 0.5% (7/1318 patient-years) from the post-marketing surveillance data. Of these 39 key cases: 22 
recovered  upon  discontinuation  of  treatment,  5  improved  conditions,  9  unresolved  and  3  were  fatal. 
The  median  time  to  event  was  49  days,  being  transaminase  elevations  the  most  frequently  reported 
hepatic event. The data is suggestive of a drug-related effect.

Due  to  the  confounding  effect  of  liver  metastasis,  data  from  adjuvant  trials  were  analysed.  As  of 
December 2007, approximately 2593 subjects have been enrolled in two adjuvant studies (EGF106708 
ALTTO  and  EGF105485  TEACH).  Overall  it  is  estimated  that  approximately  1354  of  these  2593 
adjuvant  subjects  will  have  received  lapatinib.  There  were  no  hepatic  events  reported  from  study 
EGF106708 as of 31 December 2007. A sub-set of 9 adjuvant hepatic cases were identified from study 
EGF105485  (see  laboratory  abnormalities  in  Table  30).  Of  these  9  cases,  6  were  identified  as  ‘key’ 
cases.  Lapatinib  was  discontinued  at  the  time  of  the  hepatic  event  in  all  6  subjects.  Five  subjects 
recovered (positive de-challenge), the sixth subject improved. A total of 4 (in the fifth case according 
to the table above, there was underlying progressive disease) subjects were identified as potential Hy’s 
Law  cases.  All  four  subjects  had  received  prior  chemotherapy  which  included  drugs  such  as 
anthracyclines  (e.g.  epirubicin),  cyclophosphamide  and  tamoxifen  which  have  been  associated  with 
hepatotoxicity.  The  crude  incidence  of  hepatobiliary  events  in  the  adjuvant  programme  was 
estimated as 0.4% (6/1354).

Cardiac Safety 
A summary of the decreased LVEF reports from the lapatinib clinical program (all phases) up to a cut-
off date of 30 April 2007 is shown in Figure 4. The mean time to onset of decreased LVEF in the 83 
lapatinib-treated subjects was 17 weeks (range: 2 weeks to 1 year). The mean LVEF decrease relative 
to  baseline  value  was  28.3%  (range:  20%  to  66.7%).  This  corresponded  to  a  mean  absolute  LVEF 
decrease of 18.4% from baseline (range: 11% to 46%). None of the cases was fatal.

Figure 4 - Summary of Reports of Decreased LVEF which met the Protocol Specific Definition 
(as of 30 April 2007) in 5975 lapatinib Subjects. 
From the data collected from Study EGF100151 up to the 15 March 2007 cut-off, 2.1%s subjects both 
in the lapatinib plus capecitabine group and capecitabine group experienced decreased LVEF during 
the  study.  A  total  of  241  subjects  received  lapatinib  +  capecitabine  (including  patients  who  crossed 
over) and 191 subjects received capecitabine monotherapy. 
Diarrhoea 
From  the  3  April  2006  dataset,  diarrhoea  was  reported  as  an  AE  among  65%  of  subjects  in  the 
lapatinib  plus  capecitabine  group  and  40%  of  subjects  in  the  capecitabine  group.  The  severity  of 
diarrhea was grade 1 or 2 in most subjects; however, grade 3 diarrhea was reported for approximately 
12%  of  the  subjects  in  the  lapatinib  plus  capecitabine  group  and  11%  of  the  subjects  in  the 
capecitabine group. 
Rash 
Rash was reported as an AE among 28% of subjects in the lapatinib plus capecitabine group and 14% 
of  subjects  in  the  capecitabine  group  (3  April  2006  cut-off,  Study  EGF100151).  Most  cases  of  rash 
were considered drug related and not serious (grades 1 or 2). Approximately two-thirds of subjects had 
one occurrence. Rash resolved in most cases in either group and did not lead to discontinuation from 
the study; no action was taken with respect to study medication in the majority of cases. 
Palmarplantar erythrodysaethesia (PPE) 
Approximately half the subjects in the study (3 April 2006 cut-off, Study EGF100151) had PPE (53% 
for lapatinib+capecitabine, 51% for capecitabine); most events were considered by the investigator to 
be drug related. The majority of these events were grade 1 or 2 and resolved without treatment or with 
dose adjustment.   
The median time of onset was longer in the lapatinib plus capecitabine group than in the capecitabine 
group  (median,  40  days  versus  21  days)  and  the  median  duration  was  greater  in  the  lapatinib  plus 
capecitabine group than in the capecitabine group (median, 25.5 days vs. 17 days). 
48/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Few subjects in either treatment group withdrew from treatment because of PPE events (lapatinib plus 
capecitabine: 3%, capecitabine: 3%).  Similar results were observed regardless of age group.

There  were  no  apparent  differences  in  haematologic  abnormalities  at  baseline  or  during  therapy 
between  treatment  groups.  Only  neutropenia  was  slightly  more  commonly  reported  for  the 
capecitabine monotherapy arm (grade 2 14 vs. 7%). 
Hepatic Laboratory Abnormalities: 
See hepatic safety section. 
•  Safety in special populations 
Age: About 85% of the patients in the pivotal study were below 65 years of age and 1% above 75. 
Hepatic  impairment:  About  50%  of  the  patients  in  the  pivotal  study  had  liver  metastases,  but  data 
from  patients  with  more  than  mild  impairment  are  sparse.  Lapatinib  is  metabolised  by  the  liver  and 
moderate impairment increased systemic exposure about 50%. 
Ethnicity:  No  specific  analysis  was  presented.  About  90%  of  the  patients  in  the  pivotal  study  were 
Caucasians. Ethnicity might be of importance with respect to pulmonary safety.

Renal  impairment:  No  specific  analysis  was  presented.  Estimated  creatinine  clearance  >50  was 
required for inclusion in the pivotal study.  
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No studies have been submitted. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse  events  that  led  to  discontinuation  from  the  study  were  reported  for  24%  of  subjects  in  the 
lapatinib plus capecitabine group and 23% of subjects in the capecitabine group from the 3 April 2006 
dataset. The most common reason for discontinuation from the study medication was diarrhoea (7% in 
the lapatinib plus capecitabine group and 6% in the capecitabine group) as shown in Table 32:

•  Post marketing experience 
As  of  31st  May  2007,  105  adverse  events  have  been  received  from  33  subjects  in  the  French 
nominative ATU ("temporary authorisation for use") programme for lapatinib and capecitabine in the 
treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Overall enrolment for the ATU programme was 403 patients as 
of 31 May 2007. Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, erythema and fatigue were the most frequently reported 
events. 
50/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There  were  ten  (10)  deaths  reported  from  the  ATU  programme.  All  were  indicated  to  be  associated 
with  the  advance  clinical  condition  and  cancer  progression  in  these  subjects.  There  have  been  no 
reports of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction or interstitial pneumonitis from the ATU as of 31 
May 2007. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The  most  common  adverse  reactions  (>25%)  during  therapy  with  lapatinib  plus  capecitabine  were 
gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting) or dermatologic (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
[PPE]  and  rash).  Diarrhoea  was  the  most  common  adverse  reaction  resulting  in  discontinuation  of 
treatment  (lapatinib  plus  capecitabine:  5%,  capecitabine:  3%).  The  incidence  of  PPE  was  similar  in 
both lapatinib plus capecitabine and capecitabine alone treatment arms. 
Left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  decreases  have  been  reported  in  approximately  2.1  %  of 
patients  receiving  lapatinib  and  were  asymptomatic  in  more  than  90%  of  cases.  LVEF  decreases 
resolved  or  improved  in  more  than  60%  of  cases  on  discontinuation  of  treatment  with  lapatinib. 
Symptomatic  LVEF  decreases  were  observed  in  approximately  0.1%  of  patients  who  received 
lapatinib  monotherapy.  Observed  symptoms  included  dyspnoea,  cardiac  failure  and  palpitations.  All 
events resolved promptly on discontinuation of lapatinib. LVEF decreases were reported at the same 
frequency  in  patients  who  received  lapatinib  in  combination  with  capecitabine,  as  compared  to 
patients  receiving  capecitabine  alone.  Warnings  addressing  this  risk  have  been  included  in  sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC. 
Hyperbilirubinemia  is  a  common  event  for  this  patient  population  (EGF100151,  EGF30001).  In 
addition, available results from the adjuvant setting (TEACH study), e.g. with respect to symptomatic 
events  (4  per  1000+),  are  clearly  compatible  with  an  overall  hepatic  event  rate  higher  than  1%.  As 
add-on to paclitaxel, ALT and ALP events also increased with more than 1%. Hepatotoxicity has been 
included as a “common” adverse event in section 4.8 of the SPC. In addition a warning addressing this 
risk has been included in the SPC in section 4.4.  
Diarrhoea  occurred  in  approximately  58%  of  patients  who  received  lapatinib  monotherapy.    Most 
cases of diarrhoea were grade 1 or 2 and did not result in discontinuation of treatment with lapatinib, 
however, warnings have been included in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC. 
Rash  occurred  in  approximately  37%  of  patients  who  received  lapatinib  monotherapy.    Rash  was 
generally  low  grade  and  did  not  result  in  discontinuation  of  treatment  with  lapatinib  (risk  stated  in 
section 4.8 of the SPC.

2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of this medicinal product is considered satisfactory when used with the conditions defined 
in  the  SPC.  The  documentation  provided  for  the  active  substance  lapatinib  is  comprehensive  and 
adequately  detailed.  The  pharmaceutical  development  is  adequate  for  this  oral  formulation  and  took 
into  consideration  properties  such  as  particle  size  and  the  stability  of  the  active  substance.  The 
excipients  are  those  typically  used  for  tablets.  Similarly,  the  packaging  material  is  well  documented 
and  no  incompatibility  has  been  noticed.  The  validation  of  the  manufacturing  process  ensures 
consistency and reproducibility of the finished product.  The finished product has been satisfactorily 
controlled  and  stability  studies  conducted  under  ICH  conditions  showed  that  the  product  is  stable 
throughout the proposed shelf life. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Lapatinib  was  studied  in  pregnant  rats  and  rabbits  given  oral  doses  of  30,  60,  and  120 mg/kg/day. 
There were no teratogenic effects; however, minor anomalies (left-sided umbilical artery, cervical rib 
and  precocious  ossification) occurred in rats at ≥60 mg/kg/day (4 times the expected human clinical 
exposure).  In  rabbits,  lapatinib  was  associated  with  maternal  toxicity  at  60  and  120 mg/kg/day  (8% 
and 23% of the expected human clinical exposure, respectively) and abortions at 120 mg/kg/day. At 
≥60 mg/kg/day there were decreased foetal body weights, and minor skeletal variations. In the rat pre- 
and postnatal development study, a decrease in pup survival occurred between birth and postnatal day 
21 at doses of 60 mg/kg/day or higher (5 times the expected human clinical exposure). The highest no-
effect dose for this study was 20 mg/kg/day.   
There  were  no  effects  on  male  or  female  rat  gonadal  function,  mating,  or  fertility  at  doses  up  to 
120 mg/kg/day (females) and up to 180 mg/kg/day (males) (8 and 3 times the expected human clinical 
exposure, respectively). The effect on human fertility is unknown. 
Lapatinib  was  not  clastogenic  or  mutagenic  in  a  battery  of  assays  including  the  Chinese  hamster 
chromosome aberration assay, the Ames assay, human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay and 
an in vivo rat bone marrow chromosome aberration assay.   
Efficacy 
This submission relies on a pivotal Phase III randomised, open label, active controlled trial conducted 
in ErbB2 over-expressing, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients, who were progressing 
after prior treatment that included anthracyclines, taxanes and trastuzumab. Patients were randomized 
to  receive  either  lapatinib  1250 mg  once  daily (continuously) plus capecitabine (2000 mg/m2/day on 
days  1-14  every  21  days),  or  to  receive  capecitabine  alone  (2500 mg/m2/day  on  days  1-14  every  21 
days).  The  primary  endpoint  was  time  to  progression  (TTP)  as  assessed  by  an  independent  review 
panel. A delay of the median time to progression in the order of 6 to 8 weeks was observed for the 
combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine compared to capecitabine alone.  
No  statistically  significant  effect  has  been  observed  on  overall  survival  for  the  combination  of 
lapatinib plus capecitabine compared to capecitabine alone.  
A reduced incidence of CNS metastases has been observed in secondary analyses. On the combination 
arm, there were 9 (1.5 %) progressions in the central nervous system as compared with the 18 (9%) 
progressions on the capecitabine alone arm. 
54/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety 
Overall,  the  tolerability  of  the  combination  regimen  proposed  for  licensing  appears  rather  similar  to 
capecitabine monotherapy at the licensed, slightly higher dose intensity (2500 versus 2000 mg/m2/day 
in  combination  with  lapatinib).  An  increased  incidence  of  diarrhoea  is  observed  (58%  of  patients), 
while  fatigue  is  less  frequently  reported.  Rash  occurred  in  approximately  37%  of  patients  who 
received lapatinib monotherapy. Rash was generally low grade and did not result in discontinuation of 
treatment with lapatinib 
With respect to severe and serious adverse reactions there is no overall difference, but similar to what 
is reported for trastuzumab, there were cardiac events, the cumulative incidence of decreased LVEF in 
the  lapatinib  clinical  programme  being  about  2%,  with  few  patients  experiencing  symptomatic 
decreases.  The  majority  of  the  LVEF  decreases  were  reversible.  The  incidence  of  hepatotoxicity  is 
estimated to be about 1% or higher. Other events with putative casual relationship to lapatinib include 
interstitial pneumonitis. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. 
•  User consultation 
The user testing report submitted is adequate and in accordance with current recommendations. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
Lapatinib treatment was associated with an increased time to progression. Although reduced incidence 
of CNS metastases has been suggested it needs to be confirmed prospectively and no survival benefit 
has  been  demonstrated  for  this  patient  population.  On  the  other  hand,  treatment  with  lapatinib  was 
associated with mild toxicity including frequent low grade diarrhoea, skin toxicity, hepatotoxicity and 
infrequent cardiac and possibly pulmonary toxicity. These concerns do not constitute blocking issues 
for an anti-cancer compound and therefore, the benefit-risk is concluded to be favourable. However, 
there  is  a  need  to  gain  more  understanding  about  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  the  lapatinib  plus 
capecitabine combination and it is important to further confirm the effect on reducing the incidence of 
CNS metastases and the effect on overall survival. 
As  per  CHMP  request,  an  oncology  Scientific  Advisory  Group  (SAG)  meeting  was  convened  on  5 
September 2006 to provide advice on the following questions raised by the Committee 
The first question related to the discrepancy between TTP/PFS data and survival, especially in relation 
to the most mature data set, i.e. the first 2x100 patients enrolled in the pivotal study. The experts were 
asked  if  based  on  their  experience  and  the  data  presented,  is  it  likely  that  imbalances  as  regards 
prognostic  factors  can  explain  this  imbalance  or  if  it  is  more  likely  that  differential  activity  of 
administered next-line therapies is an explanation; alternatively it was asked if a difference in TTP in 
this study population a poor predictor of a difference in survival, taking into account also that TTP and 
survival  in  the  capecitabine  alone  arm  were  better  than  expected  based  on  historical  data.  The  SAG 
agreed  unanimously  that  the  data  presented  by  the  applicant,  both  TTP/PFS  and  OS  have  been 
properly  analysed  and  that  possible  imbalances  arising  from  cross-over,  baseline  characteristics  or 
next line therapies are unlikely to affect the overall conclusions. The sensitivity analyses provided by 
the  applicant  proved  consistency  in  the  results  and  possible  sources  of  bias  have  been  taken  into 
account. The SAG expressed its concerns about the lack of a statistically significant overall survival 
data for the patients following the treatment with Tyverb. The SAG acknowledged that the prolonged 
time  to  death  after  tumour  progression  seen  in  this  particular  trial  might  have  diluted  the  apparent 
treatment  effect,  however,  due  to  the  short  survival  expectancy  in  this  group  of  patients,  OS  would 
have been a more adequate primary endpoint. 
55/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  SAG  was  also  asked  if  the  estimated  benefit  in  terms  of  TTP  for  lapatinib  as  add-on  to 
capecitabine of about 6 weeks was considered clinically meaningful. By majority, the SAG was of the 
opinion  that  6  weeks  improvement  in  median  TTP  is  not  clinically  meaningful  in  the  context  of 
treatment  of  advanced  breast  cancer  in  late  lines  of  treatment.  The  SAG  considered  that  additional 
evidence of efficacy should be presented by the applicant in order to justify a positive benefit for the 
treatment, especially considering that overall survival could not be demonstrated in the pivotal trial. 
Following  the  SAG  advice  the  CHMP  considered  that  further  data  was  needed  in  order  to  further 
clarify the clinical meaningfulness of the efficacy seen in terms of TTP and that additional evidence 
should  be  provided  confirming  the  effect  on  reducing  the  incidence  of  CNS  metastases  and  overall 
survival.  The  applicant  presented  an  updated  overall  survival  analysis  showing  a  trend  to  improved 
survival in the combination arm. In addition a reduced incidence of CNS metastases was observed in 
secondary analyses (see clinical efficacy). The applicant presented a number of arguments at an oral 
explanation  with  the  CHMP.  In  summary,  the  applicant  argued  that  there  are  no  approved  ErbB2-
directed therapy after trastuzumab, that treatment with lapatinib plus capecitabine was associated with 
a number of important clinical benefits in terms of TTP, response rate, overall survival, incidence of 
brain metastasis as 1st site of recurrence, time without symptoms as measured by QTWiST, and that it 
has  a  number  of  favourable  characteristics  in  that  it  is  an  oral  treatment,  that  does  not  prolong 
hospitalizations  or  impair  health-related  quality  of  life.  Furthermore,  treatment  with  lapatinib  plus 
capecitabine  was associated with minimal severe or life-threatening toxicity, low cardiotoxicity, and 
minimal lung toxicity. The applicant concluded that the observed benefits of the combination largely 
exceeded the risk for the patients in the target indication, and that unmet needs will be met. 
The  CHMP  considered  all  the  new  evidence  submitted  by  the  applicant  and  the  argumentation  put 
forward by the applicant and the SAG experts. The CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance for 
the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine was positive. There is a need however to obtain further 
data on the incidence of CNS metastases and the effect on overall survival. Thus, the CHMP proposed 
a  conditional  marketing  authorisation,  after  having  consulted  the  applicant.  The  CHMP  considered 
that  lapatinib  is  a  medicinal  product  which  aims  at  the  treatment  of  a  life-threatening  disease,  and 
therefore falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, and that fulfils the requirements of 
Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 based on the following grounds: 
a.  Efficacy in terms of TTP prolongation has been demonstrated in a pivotal Phase III randomised, 
open  label,  active  controlled  trial  conducted  in  ErbB2-overexpressing,  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic breast cancer patients, who were progressing after prior treatment that included taxanes, 
anthracyclines and trastuzumab. Overall, a delay of the median time to progression in the order of 
6  to  8  weeks  was  observed.  A  favourable  effect  of  lapatinib  plus  capecitabine  combination 
compared  to  capecitabine  alone  was  also  observed  in  terms  of  secondary  endpoints  including 
progression-free survival, response rate and duration of response. In addition a reduced incidence 
of  CNS  metastases  has  been  observed  in  secondary  analyses.  Treatment  with  lapatinib  was 
associated  with  mild  toxicity  including  frequent  low  grade  diarrhoea  and  skin  toxicity  and 
infrequent  cardiac  and  possibly  pulmonary  toxicity.  These  concerns  do  not  constitute  blocking 
issues  for  an  anti-cancer  compound  in  this  indication.  Therefore,  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  the 
medicinal product, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 2001/83/EC, is positive. 
b.  There  is  a  need  to  gain  more  understanding  about  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  the  lapatinib  plus 
capecitabine combination. To this end, it is important to further confirm the effect on reducing the 
incidence  of  CNS  metastases  and  the  effect  on  overall  survival.  The  applicant  will  provide 
comprehensive clinical data in a new Phase III randomised, controlled clinical study to evaluate a 
decreased  incidence  of  brain  metastases  as  a  site  of  relapse  with  a  lapatinib-containing  therapy 
compared with an appropriate, trastuzumab-containing control arm. The applicant has provided a 
detailed proposal about this study and estimated timelines for completing the trial. In addition the 
applicant  will  perform  and  submit  an  updated  analysis  of  survival  data  for  study  EGF100151. 
Thus, it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data.   
c.  Currently  there  are  only  few  treatment  options  approved  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  or 
metastatic breast cancer patients, who were progressing after prior treatment that included taxanes, 
56/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anthracyclines and trastuzumab. Lapatinib in combination with capecitabine has shown to prolong 
time to progression and this effect was clinically significant in this patient population. Lapatinib 
may  in  addition  have  a  positive  effect  on  the  incidence  of  brain  recurrence,  although  this  effect 
will need to be confirmed. In accordance to the definition of Article 4, paragraph 2, of Regulation 
(EC)  No 507/2006,  the  medicinal  product  concerned  will  be  of  major  therapeutic  advantage  to 
those affected. Therefore, unmet medical needs will be fulfilled. 
d.  In view of the favourable benefit-risk profile, the immediate availability on the market outweighs 
the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that: 
(cid:131)  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed 
to investigate further some of the safety concerns.  
(cid:131)  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
majority decision that the risk-benefit balance of Tyverb in combination with capecitabine in the 
treatment of: 
Patients  with  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  whose  tumours  overexpress  ErbB2 
(HER2).  Patients  should  have  progressive  disease  following  prior  therapy  which  must 
include anthracyclines and taxanes and therapy with trastuzumab in the metastatic setting 
was  favourable,  and 
authorisation. 
therefore  recommended 
the  granting  of  a  conditional  marketing 
Divergent opinions were based on the following considerations: 
•  No  clear  effect  has  been  shown  in  terms  of  overall  survival  and  other  clinical  benefit 
endpoints.  The  activity  observed  in  terms  of  TTP  or  PFS  is  low  and  it  is  highly 
questionable  whether  this  constitutes  a  meaningful  clinical  benefit  for  ErbB2  over-
expressing,  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  patients,  who  were  progressing 
after prior treatment that included taxanes, anthracyclines and trastuzumab. 
•  Treatment  with  lapatinib  was  associated  with  frequent,  low  grade  diarrhoea  and  skin 
toxicity and infrequent but significant cardiac and possibly pulmonary toxicity. 
•  The  activity  observed  for  lapatinib  was  too  low  to  outweigh  the  risks  associated  with 
treatment with lapatinib.

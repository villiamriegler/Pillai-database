1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, AstraZeneca AB submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 12 March 2018 an application for a variation.  
The following variation was requested:

C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition

Extension of indication to include the use of Lynparza tablets as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with BRCA1/2-mutated HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer who have previously been 
treated with chemotherapy; these patients could have received chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, 
adjuvant or metastatic setting. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC for 
Lynparza tablets are updated.  Section 4.8 of the SmPC for the Lynparza capsules and relevant sections 
of the package leaflet have been updated accordingly. Furthermore, RMP version 16 has also been 
provided. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant requested Scientific Advice to the CHMP related to clinical aspects of the dossier. 
The MAH received scientific advice pertaining to clinical aspects of the dossier from the CHMP on 
21/01/2010 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/61318/2010) related to an early study design that the MAH did not 
pursue and follow-up scientific advice on 25/07/2013 (EMEA/H/SA/1215/2/FU/1/2013/II) in regard to 
new design of the study.

In the second scientific advice, the CHMP advised that HER2-positive patients be excluded from this trial 
as there are other therapeutic options that have a demonstrated survival benefit in the relapsed setting 
and the proportion of patients with BRCA 1/2-mutated and HER2-positive breast cancer is considered 
very small, to which the applicant agreed.  Only hormone receptor positive patients who failed at least 
one hormonal treatment or were unsuitable for hormonal therapy were allowed into the trial.  The MAH 
proposed to include ER and/or PgR+ patients after progression on one or more lines of endocrine 
treatment. Including ER/PR positive patients after progression on one endocrine treatment while 
subsequent anti-hormonal agents can be active, was considered acceptable at the discretion of the 
treating physician, as a switch to another anti-hormonal agent was not considered feasible due to short or 
no response to 1st-line treatment, although this could be subjective. 
The Applicant was asked to define in more detail in the protocol “suitable for single-agent chemotherapy”, 
e.g. in relation to different lines of chemotherapy. In the first-line metastatic setting, for example, this 
could mean poor tolerability or early relapse on prior adjuvant anthracycline/taxane therapy. 
The CHMP highlighted the need to study a homogenous population for ease of assessment, such as 
limiting to second and third line patients.  However, feasibility to do as such was considered challenging 
and therefore, applicant also included first line patients.   
Regarding the physician’s choice of capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin as a comparator arm in the 
OlympiAD study, the CHMP questioned the absence of a platinum therapy as a treatment option. In the 
first-line metastatic setting, and especially in case of BRCA1 mutations, it was considered likely that many 
clinicians would opt for cisplatin or carboplatin alone or in combination with gemcitabine or paclitaxel, 
especially in symptomatic or early progressive disease. Enrolment criteria would exclude these patients.  
Whilst resistance to prior platinum-based therapy as exclusion criterion was accepted due to expected 
cross-resistance to PARP inhibitors, it was harder to accept, and not understood, that platinum therapy is 
not an option as a comparator. 
The use of the more common dose of capecitabine of 1000 mg/m2 was recommended.  However, a dose 
of 2500 mg/m2 was used in OlympiAD, to be consistent with the prescribing information. 
PFS as a primary endpoint for OlympiAD was proposed due to the relatively small target population and 
the expected crossover to alternative PARP inhibitors after progression in the control arm, and due to 
other sequential treatment options.  The CHMP recommended that patients be followed for PFS2; PFS2 as 
assessed by investigators is a secondary endpoint in OlympiAD.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The  claimed  indication  is  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  BRCA1/2-mutated  HER2  negative 
metastatic breast cancer who have previously been treated with chemotherapy.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Breast cancer is a life-threatening disease and is the second leading cause of cancer death among women 
and the fourth leading cause of cancer death overall1.  
In 2018, it is estimated that there will be 268,670 newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in the US, and 
approximately 41,400 people will die from breast cancer1. Across 40 European countries, the estimated 
age-adjusted annual incidence in 2012 was 92.8/100,000 and the mortality 23.1/100,0002. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Approximately 5% of breast cancers are associated with a germline mutation in the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 
gene with approximately 3% associated with the BRCA2 gene (generally hormone receptor positive). The 
presence of BRCA1 mutations is associated with a lifetime risk of breast cancer ranging from 60% to 70% 
(Antoniou et al 2003). BRCA2 mutations are associated with a lifetime risk of breast cancer between 40% 
to 60% in women and 5% to 10% in men. 
Approximately 70% of BRCA1 mutated breast cancer present as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). In 
contrast, breast cancer patients carrying mutations in the BRCA2 gene are more likely to be positive for 
expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and PgR and only approximately 20% are TNBC3. 
Although there are phenotypic differences in breast cancers resulting from gBRCA1 or gBRCA2 mutations, 
their important commonality is that mutations in either gene could result in development of tumours that 
are deficient in homologous recombination.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The diagnosis of breast cancer is based on clinical examination in combination with imaging, and 
confirmed by pathological assessment. Disease stage is assessed according to the TNM system (ESMO 
clinical practice guideline). Although treatable, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains an incurable 
disease with a median overall survival (OS) of approximately 3 years and a 5-year survival of only 
approximately 25%4,5.

2.1.5.  Management 
The  selection  of  appropriate  therapy  for  advanced  breast  cancer  comprising  locally  advanced  and 
metastatic breast cancer is complex because of the many treatment options and biologic heterogeneity of 
the disease (ABC4 consensus guidelines). The potential treatment options are determined in accordance 
with ER and PR and HER2 status of the tumour. Treatment options for patients presenting with metastatic 
breast  cancer  may  also  be  influenced  by  what  adjuvant  therapy  was  used,  how  soon  after  adjuvant 
therapy the patient relapses, and by sites of metastasis.  
For patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, there is no preferred first-line chemotherapy. 
Sequential monotherapy with single agent capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin are among the preferred 
choices in metastatic breast cancer patients previously treated with an anthracycline and a taxane in the 
adjuvant  or  metastatic  setting  and  for  whom  further  hormonal  treatments  are  not  indicated6.  Additional 
choices  include  gemcitabine,  platinum  agents,  taxanes  and  liposomal  anthracyclines7.  Combination 
chemotherapy is reserved for patients with rapid clinical progression, life-threatening visceral metastases, 
or need for rapid symptom and/or disease control6,7.  
Currently,  single  agent  chemotherapy  after  previous  exposure  to  anthracyclines  and  taxanes  has  a 
median progression free survival (PFS) of approximately 4 months and an overall survival (OS) of 9 to 16 
months when given early in the metastatic setting. 
There is no targeted therapy available to date for the treatment of TNBC. The prognosis for patients with 
TNBC  and/or  those  who  carry  gBRCA1  mutations  with  metastatic  disease  may  even  be  worse  than  the 
overall metastatic breast cancer population. According to current NCCN guidelines (2018), carboplatin is 
considered  as  one  of  recommended  regimens  for  recurrent  or  metastatic  disease.  In  advanced  TNBC 
patients (regardless of BRCA status) previously treated with anthracyclines with or without taxanes in the 
(neo)adjuvant  setting,  carboplatin  showed  comparable  efficacy  and  a  more  favourable  toxicity  profile, 
compared  with  docetaxel,  and  is  considered,  therefore,  an  important  treatment  option.  However  in 
patients with BRCA-associated advanced TNBC or endocrine-resistant advanced breast cancer a platinum 
regimen is considered as a preferred option, if not previously administered7. 
For  the  treatment  of  hormone  receptor  (HR)-positive,  HER2-negative  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
breast cancer, CDK4/6 inhibitors have been recently approved in combination with an aromatase inhibitor 
or fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or in women who have received prior endocrine therapy.   
Everolimus,  an  mTOR  inhibitor,  is  also  approved  for  the  treatment  of  hormone  receptor-positive,  HER2 
negative  advanced  breast  cancer,  in  combination  with  exemestane,  in  postmenopausal  women  without 
symptomatic  visceral  disease  after  recurrence  or  progression  following  a  non-steroidal  aromatase 
inhibitor. 
There are currently no treatments approved in the European Union (EU)  specifically for BRCAm patients 
with  metastatic  breast  cancer  and  these  patients  are  treated  according  to  their  hormone  receptor  and

Olaparib  is  a  potent  inhibitor  of  human  poly  (ADP-ribose)  polymerase  enzymes  (PARP-1,  PARP-2,  and 
PARP-3),  and  has  been  shown  to  inhibit  the  growth  of  selected  tumour  cell  lines  in  vitro  and  tumour 
growth in vivo either as a standalone treatment or in combination with established chemotherapies. 
PARPs are required for the efficient repair of DNA single strand breaks and an important aspect of PARP-
induced repair requires that after chromatin modification, PARP auto-modifies itself and dissociates from

the DNA to facilitate access for base excision repair (BER) enzymes. When olaparib is bound to the active 
site of DNA-associated PARP it prevents the dissociation of PARP and traps it on the DNA, thus blocking 
repair. In replicating cells this also leads to the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) when 
replication forks meet the PARP-DNA adducts. In normal cells, homologous recombination repair (HRR) 
pathway is effective at repairing these DNA DSBs. In cancers that lack functional components of HRR 
such as BRCA1 or 2, DNA DSBs cannot be repaired accurately or effectively. Instead, alternative and 
error-prone pathways are activated, such as the classical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, 
leading to increased genomic instability. After a number of rounds of replication, genomic instability can 
reach insupportable levels and result in cancer cell death, as cancer cells already have a high DNA 
damage load relative to normal cells. In the absence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, HRR pathway may be 
compromised by other mechanisms, although the causative aberrancy and penetrance are not fully 
elucidated. Absence of fully functional HRR pathway is one of the key determinants of platinum sensitivity 
in ovarian and other cancers. 
Lynparza,  50  mg  capsule  formulation,  was  approved  on  16  December  2014  in  monotherapy  for  the 
maintenance  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  platinum-sensitive  relapsed  BRCA-mutated  (germline 
and/or somatic) high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are 
in response (complete response or partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy.  
Subsequently a tablet formulation (100 mg and 150 mg) was approved on 8 May 2018 as monotherapy 
for  the  maintenance  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  platinum-sensitive  relapsed  high-grade  epithelial 
ovarian,  fallopian  tube,  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer  who  are  in  response  (complete  or  partial)  to 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The proposed target patient population in this application is focused on BRCAm HER2-negative metastatic 
breast cancer. The pivotal study included patients with gBRCAm TNBC as well as BRCAm ER and/or PgR+ 
patients. 
The  applicant  claimed  the  use  of  the  already  approved  tablet  formulation  in  the  following  proposed 
indication:  “Lynparza  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  BRCA1/2-
mutated HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer who have previously been treated with chemotherapy. 
These patients could have received chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting.” 
The recommended indication is: 
“Lynparza  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  germline  BRCA1/2-
mutations,  who  have  HER2  negative  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer.  Patients  should  have 
previously  been  treated  with  an  anthracycline  and  a  taxane  in  the  (neo)adjuvant  or  metastatic  setting 
unless patients were not suitable for these treatments (see section 5.1). 
Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer should also have progressed on or after prior 
endocrine therapy, or be considered unsuitable for endocrine therapy” 
The  recommended  dose  of  Lynparza  is  300  mg  (two  150  mg  tablets)  taken  twice  daily,  equivalent  to  a 
total daily dose of 600 mg. The 100 mg tablet is available for dose reduction. 
It  is  recommended  that  treatment  be  continued  until  progression  of  the  underlying  disease  or 
unacceptable toxicity. There are no data on retreatment with Lynparza following subsequent relapse (see 
section 5.1). 
Patients  must  have  confirmation  of  a  deleterious  or  suspected  deleterious  gBRCA1/2  mutation  before 
Lynparza  treatment  is  initiated.  gBRCA1/2  mutation  status  should  be  determined  by  an  experienced 
laboratory using a validated test method. Data demonstrating clinical validation of tumour BRCA1/2 tests 
in breast cancer are not currently available.

GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Table 2: Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new clinical PK study was submitted to support the proposed indication in BRCAm patients with HER2-
negative metastatic breast cancer. A population PK analysis (Olaparib MS-05) performed using an earlier 
developed model and including sparse data collected in patient with breast cancer OlympiAD was 
provided.

Population PK analysis (Olaparib-MS-05) 
Objectives 
The  objectives  of  this  analysis  were  to:  1)  characterise  olaparib  PK  in  patients  with  metastatic  breast 
cancer  in  OlympiAD  study;  2)  obtain  individual  PK  parameter  estimates  with  plasma  concentrations 
available;  3)  explore  and  model  (if  feasible)  the  relationship  between  olaparib  plasma  exposure  and 
selected efficacy and safety variables. 
Methods 
A  total  of  302  patients  were  randomised  2:1  (olaparib:  physician’s  choice  chemotherapy)  into  the 
OlympiAD study.  Plasma samples for PK were collected in a sub-group of patients randomised to olaparib 
treatment  group,  at  Day  1  Cycle  2  at  following  time  window,  Pre-dose,  between  0  and  0.5  hour  post-
dose,  between  0.5  and  1.5  hour  post-dose,  between  3  and  6  hours  post-dose,  and  between  6  and  12 
hours post-dose.  The final PK data sets comprised 174 olaparib plasma concentrations from 36 olaparib-
treated subjects. Of 36 subjects, 7 subjects had dose reduction from 300 mg bd to 250, 200 and 50 mg 
during the course of olaparib treatment. 
The  population  PK  model  from  Olaparib-MS-02  and  Olaparib-MS-03  served  as  basis  for  the  model 
development,  but  was  further  refined  where  deemed  necessary.    Patient  covariate  relationships  were 
examined in a stepwise procedure to examine the impact of individual patient characteristics on olaparib 
PK.  Individual  PK  parameters  as  well  as  exposure  estimates  for  subsequent  exposure-response 
assessment were derived based on the final PK model.  The average AUC, Cmax, Cmin of 2 olaparib dose 
administrations  during  the  safety  event  day,  abbreviated  as  dAUC,  dCmax,  dCmin,  respectively,  were 
used as exposure on the safety event day for the safety exposure- response analysis.  Since efficacy or 
safety events may associate with exposure from the beginning of olaparib treatment to the event day, an 
overall measure of exposure in mean AUC was used, using average olaparib concentration from the start 
of olaparib dose administrations to the efficacy or safety event day multiplied by dose interval (12 hours), 
abbreviated  as  average  cumulative  AUC  (acAUC),  was  used  for  exposure-response  analysis  for  both 
safety and efficacy events.  The exposure metric acAUC is similar to steady state AUC, but considers the 
dose interruption and reduction over the period of olaparib treatment. 
The  relationship  between olaparib  exposure  and  safety/efficacy  was  explored graphically  and  modeled  if 
supported by data.  
Results 
The  exposure  to olaparib in  the  Phase  III  study  OlympiAD  was  determined  using  population  PK  analysis 
(N=36) and the estimated Gmean (coefficient of variation %) for Cmax,ss, AUCss and Cmin,ss after 300 
mg tablet bd were 6.41 μg/mL (41%), 41.2 μg.h/mL (42%) and 1.17 (87%) μg.h/mL. 
The model structure for plasma concentration data from OlympiAD was the same as the previous models 
(Olaparib-MS-02 and Olaparib-MS-03): a linear 2-compartment model with sequential zero and first-order 
absorption  rates  and  first-order  elimination.  Covariates  including  age,  body  weight,  gender,  race,  tablet 
strength, hepatic and renal function markers were evaluated in the population analysis, and none of them 
were identified as significant covariates impacting olaparib PK.  The estimates of geometric mean steady-
state exposure in AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss in patients with metastatic breast cancer were similar to 
those from patients with ovarian cancer in SOLO2 study. 
The  relationships  between  exposure  and  efficacy  (progression  free  survival  [PFS],  overall  survival  [OS] 
and  time  from  randomisation  to  second  progression  or  death    [PFS2])  was  examined  with  Kaplan-Meier

plots stratified by tertiles of exposure and showed no pattern that would suggest response differs at the 
exposures analysed in this study.  No testing via modelling was performed. 
Graphical  exploratory  analyses  were  conducted  to  explore  the  exposure-safety  analysis  for  anaemia, 
fatigue  and  haemoglobin  (Hb).  No  significant  exposure-safety  relationship  was  found,  except  a  weak 
relationship  between  olaparib  exposure  in  acAUC  and  Hb  levels.    A  relationship  was  observed  between 
olaparib  exposure  in  acAUC  and  haemoglobin  concentrations,  and  can  be  described  by  an  indirect 
response model.  The model predicted a small decrease in haemoglobin concentrations with the increase 
in  olaparib  exposure  and  model  simulation  indicated  a  negligible  change  haemoglobin  concentration  for 
the majority of olaparib exposures observed.  
A comparison of steady state olaparib exposure for the capsule and tablet formulations determined using 
population PK analysis is provided below.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Olaparib  is  a  potent  inhibitor  of  human  poly  (ADP  ribose)  polymerase  enzymes  (PARP  1,  PARP  2,  and 
PARP  3),  and  has  been  shown  to  inhibit  the  growth  of  selected  tumour  cell  lines  in  vitro  and  tumour 
growth in vivo either as a standalone treatment or in combination with established chemotherapies.  
PARPs are required for the efficient repair of DNA single strand breaks and an important aspect of PARP 
induced repair requires that after chromatin modification, PARP auto modifies itself and dissociates from 
the DNA to facilitate access for base excision repair (BER) enzymes. When olaparib is bound to the active 
site of DNA associated PARP it prevents the dissociation of PARP and traps it on the DNA, thus blocking 
repair. In replicating cells this leads to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) when replication forks meet the

PARP  DNA  adduct.  In  normal  cells,  homologous  recombination  repair  (HRR),  which  requires  functional 
BRCA1 and 2 genes, is effective at repairing these DNA DSBs. In the absence of functional BRCA1 or 2, 
DNA DSBs cannot be repaired via HRR. Instead, alternative and error prone pathways are activated, such 
as  the  non-homologous  end  joining  (NHEJ)  pathway,  leading  to  increased  genomic  instability.  After  a 
number  of  rounds  of  replication,  genomic  instability  can  reach  insupportable  levels  and  result  in  cancer 
cell death, as cancer cells have a high DNA damage load relative to normal cells (See SmPC Section 5.1). 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Effect of olaparib on the QT interval 
The relationship between QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) and plasma concentrations was 
evaluated in Studies 04 and 07. Following the 300 mg bd tablet dose olaparib had no clinically significant 
effect on QT interval (QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s correction [QTcF] and QT 
interval corrected for heart rate using individual-specific correction [QTcI]). 
Germline BRCA diagnostic testing  
Patients were required to have documented evidence of a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation 
in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 to be enrolled into the OlympiAD study. Evidence of a qualifying BRCA 
mutation could be from either an existing BRCA mutation result generated by local testing or from 
prospective testing performed by BGI or by Myriad using either the Integrated BRACAnalysis test (also 
referred to as the Myriad CLIA gBRCA test) or the BRACAnalysis CDx test (also referred to as the Myriad 
CDx gBRCA test). 
Table 4: Number of samples in analysis sets in OlympiAD 
In total, 2126 subjects were screened for entry into OlympiAD. Within patients meeting the clinical study 
eligibility criteria, 167 subjects were randomised based on an existing local gBRCAm result, 65 based on a 
Myriad gBRCAm CLIA result, 29 based on a Myriad gBRCAm CDx result and 41 based on a gBRCAm result 
from BGI testing. Among 302 randomised patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations, the gBRCAm status was 
confirmed by the Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx assay in 297 patients. 
Previously reported data have shown an association between the mutated gBRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and 
disease histology, with gBRCA1 mutations being associated with TNBC and BRCA2 mutations being 
associated with HR+ disease8.  These reported associations were also seen in the HR+ and TNBC patients 
in OlympiAD. The mutation types as gBRCAm by Myriad testing were reported.

Exploratory analysis of tumour samples 
Patients  who  entered  screening  part  2  of  the  OlympiAD  study  were  requested  to  provide  tumour  tissue 
material  for  exploratory  analyses  if  such  material  was  available.  There  was  no  mandatory  re-biopsy 
required  in  cases  where  patients  did  not  have  tumour  material  available.  Only  161  of  the  overall  302 
patients (53%) were able to provide a tumour sample.  
A comparison between gBRCA and tBRCA results identified that the deleterious or suspected deleterious 
mutation  present in  the  germline  was  detected  in  the  tumour  in  141/143  cases  (in  1  case,  2  mutations 
were reported in the germline and both mutations were also reported in the tumour sample).  
Locus-specific LOH data were reported in 125 of the 143 tBRCA tested patients (87.4%). Overall, tumour 
LOH was observed for 118/125 (94.4%) deleterious mutations observed in the germline. 
BRCA  analysis  using  the  Myriad  myChoice  HRD  plus  test  generated  a  valid  homologous  recombination 
deficiency (HRD) score in 130 samples. Of these, 108 (83.1%) had a HRD score ≥ 42 and the HRD scores 
<42  were  seen  in  16.3%.  A  higher  proportion  of  negative  HRD  scores  in  the  hormone  receptor  positive 
(HR+)  patients  (13/59  [22%])  versus  the  triple  negative  breast  cancer  (TNBC)  patients  (8/70  [11%]) 
was reported. A higher proportion of patients with TNBC  had mutations in TP53 (86%) than with HER2-
/HR+ (22%).  
2.3.4.  PK/PD relationship and modelling 
Analysis of tumour samples 
Study 07, a Phase I open-label study to identify an effective biological dose to be used for further clinical 
studies of olaparib by using biomarkers of PARP activity to delineate a PARP inhibitory concentration 
response curve for the selected doses of olaparib in breast tumour, was submitted with the initial MA 
application.  
Intermediate and high risk breast cancer patients were randomly allocated to 1 of 5 dose cohorts (10 mg 
bd, 30 mg bd, 100 mg bd, 200 mg bd, and 400 mg bd) and received treatment for 4 or 5 days prior to 
surgery. Overall, 60 patients were randomized, 12 in each dose cohort, and all patients completed 
treatment.

Tumour biopsy samples were obtained before surgery from 60 intermediate and high risk breast cancer 
patients. Determination of concentrations of olaparib in tumour biopsies showed that measurable 
concentrations (>40 ng/g) were present in all but one of the samples collected from patients dosed at 30, 
100, 200 and 400 mg bd. The extent of PARP inhibition in tumour samples ranged from about 20% to 
80% compared with baseline and no clear relationship with dose could be showed. 
Exposure/response (E-R) analysis for efficacy event in OlympiAD trial (DCO (25 September 2017)) 
The  final  E-R  analysis  data  set  for  efficacy  events  included  36  subjects.  There  were  only  12,  11  and  13 
patients at the lower, middle and upper tertiles of acAUC exposure. 
Kaplan-Meier survival estimate plots stratified by tertiles of acAUC for PFS2 and OS are shown below.

The PKPD analysis in Olaparib-MS-02 did not show any significant exposure-safety relationship, except for 
haemoglobin  (Hb)  level  where  increased  olaparib  exposure  was  associated  with  a  reduction  in  Hb  level.  
The PKPD analyses of OlympiAD and SOLO2 in the  Phase III studies also showed an exposure response 
relationship for Hb. In Olaparib-MS-05, the simulations from the Hb model indicated a very small change 
in mean Hb concentration time course until olaparib exposure approached the upper bound of 95% CI of 
predicted AUCss (100 µg.h/mL).  The predicted mean Hb concentrations around the upper bound of 95% 
CI  of  the  predicted  AUCss  were  still  above  10g/dL.  No  significant  concentration  dependent  relationship 
was found for nausea, vomiting, platelet count, dysguesia, constipation, dyspepsia, or neutropenia. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant claims the use of olaparib tablets in the treatment of patients with BRCA-Mutated HER2-
Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer metastatic breast cancer. 
With regards to PK data, the MAH submitted an overview of the pharmacokinetics of the tablet 
formulation and a population PK analysis (Olaparib MS-05) performed using an earlier developed model 
and including sparse data collected in patient with breast cancer OlympiAD. The PK properties (ADME) of 
olaparib were presented and assessed satisfactorily in previous applications related to the use of olaparib 
in the treatment of ovarian cancer. The biopharmaceutical performances of the capsule and tablet 
formulation were elucidated. The tablet showed higher bioavailability (approximately doubled) and less 
variablebehaviour. In the pivotal phase 3 study supporting the breast cancer indication, only the currently 
approved tablet formulation was used. No formal PK study was performed in the target population 
(claimed indication). However, sparse sampling data were collected for the purpose of population-PK 
analysis. The results of the population PK analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the small 
number of evaluable patients (N=36) in this analysis. 
The exposure to olaparib following administration of 300mg bd tablet formulation observed in the Phase 
III  study  OlympiAD  (Olaparib-MS-05,  N=36)  was  comparable  to  that  in  SOLO2  (Olaparib-MS-03,  N=94) 
and was within the range previously predicted for the capsule formulation at 400mg bd (Olaparib-MS-01). 
However, it was slightly lower (AUCss was 32% lower) than the one observed in the pooled Phase I tablet 
population  PK  analysis  due  to  study  variability  (Olaparib-MS-02).  A  comparison  of  steady-state  olaparib 
exposure for the capsule and tablet formulations determined using the population PK analysis (Olaparib-
MS-01, Olaparib-MS-02 and Olaparib MS-03) was provided. In addition, potential causes of the apparent 
differences  in  olaparib  exposure  between  the  SOLO2  study  and  the  pooled  tablet  analysis  were  further 
investigated and it appeared that this difference was due to variability between studies. Section 5.2 of the 
SmPC has been updated to reflect that patient gender was also not a significant covariate. 
For  the  applied  indication  i.e.  germline  breast  cancer  susceptibility  genes  (gBRCA1/2)  mutated  human 
epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2  (HER2)-negative  metastatic  breast  cancer,  patients  must  have 
confirmation  of  a  deleterious  or  suspected  deleterious  gBRCA1/2  mutation  before  Lynparza  treatment  is 
initiated. gBRCA1/2 mutation status should be determined by an experienced laboratory using a validated 
test  method  (see  SmPC  section  4.2).  Genetic  counselling  for  patients  tested  for  mutations  in  gBRCA1/2 
genes should be performed according to local regulations. 
Data in regard to analytical and clinical validation in breast cancer patients of the in-vitro diagnostic tests 
proposed  to  be  used  for  the  detection  of  deleterious  or  suspected  deleterious  BRCA1/2  mutations  in 
tumours  have  not  been  provided.  It  is  reflected  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC  that  data  demonstrating 
clinical validation of tumour BRCA1/2 tests in breast cancer are not currently available.  
Exploratory  analysis  of  tumour  samples  in  study  OlympiAD  showed  that  a  higher  proportion  of  patients 
with  TNBC  had  mutations  in  TP53  (86%)  than  with  HER2-/HR+  (22%)  which  is  consistent  with  results 
from  other  studies  and  suggest  a  potential  mechanistic  rationale  for  investigating  TP53  mutation  in

patients  with  BRCAm  tumours.  In  high-grade  serous  ovarian  cancer  (HGSOC),  mutations  in  TP53  are 
nearly  universal  and  exploratory  analysis  of  results  from  the  Study  19,  the  phase  II  double-blind, 
randomised,  placebo-controlled,  multicentre  study  conducted  in  advanced  platinum-sensitive  HGSOC, 
suggested a role of disruptive p53 mutations in predicting OS in patients treated with olaparib.  
The  MAH  is  recommended  to  further  investigate  the  prognostic  and  predictive  value  of  tests  that  would 
allow  quantitative  assessment  of  genomic  instability  and  homologous  recombination  deficiencies  in 
patients  with  different  histological  types  of  breast  tumours,  including  those  with  specific  mutations  and 
large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1, BRCA2 and other HRR-related genes. 
In terms of exposure-efficacy relationship no definitive conclusion can be made due to a limited number 
of samples. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No new biopharmaceutical or clinical pharmacology study were provided to support the proposed 
indication in BRCAm in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer which is considered 
acceptable. Available pharmacology data on olaparib provides sufficient characterisation of the key PK 
characteristics of olaparib and provides sufficient data in support of an adequate labelling for special 
populations and DDI. 
The germline BRCA1/2 mutation status was centrally confirmed in blood samples in the majority of 
patients randomised in the pivotal study and exploratory analyses of available tumour samples were 
conducted. The MAH is recommended to further investigate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.

Treatments 
Olaparib 
The  planned  dose  of  300  mg  bd  comprised  two  150  mg  tablets  bd.  The  100  mg  tablets  were  used  to 
manage dose reductions.  
Chemotherapy 
Dosing and treatment regimen information for capecitabine, vinorelbine and eribulin were included in the 
local package inserts supplied with the drug.  
-Oral  capecitabine  2500  mg/m2  to  be  taken  daily  (divided  in  2  doses)  for  14  days,  repeated  every  21 
days 
-Intravenous (IV) vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 8, repeated every 21 days 
-Intravenous eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m2 or eribulin (active substance) 1.23 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 8, 
repeated every 21 days. 
Study centre personnel were instructed to follow the prescribing information for toxicity management and 
dose  reduction.  Standard  or  reduced  doses  of  capecitabine  could  be  used  after  the  first  cycle  as  per 
standard clinical practice. No switch to olaparib was permitted in this study. 
Other  medication  considered  necessary  for  the  patient’s  safety  and  well-being  could  be  given  at  the 
discretion  of  the  Investigator(s).  The  administration  of  all  medication  (including  study  drugs)  was 
recorded in the eCRFs until 30 days following the last CSP treatment. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  single  agent  olaparib  versus 
physician’s choice chemotherapy (capecitabine, vinorelbine or eribulin) by progression-free survival (PFS) 
using  blinded  independent  central  review  (BICR)  data  assessed  by  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid 
Tumors (RECIST version 1.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 26/124 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Secondary objectives 
1. To compare the efficacy of single agent olaparib versus physician’s choice chemotherapy (capecitabine, 
vinorelbine or eribulin) by assessment of OS, time to second progression or death (PFS2) and ORR using 
BICR data assessed by RECIST version 1.1. 
2.  To  assess  the  effect  of  olaparib  on  the  Health-related  Quality  of  Life  (HRQoL)  as  measured  by  the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30-item 
module (EORTC QLQ-C30) global quality of life (QoL) scale. 
3. To assess the efficacy of olaparib in patients identified as having a deleterious or suspected deleterious 
variant  in  either  of  the  BRCA  genes  using  variants  identified  with  current  and  future  BRCA  mutation 
assays (gene sequencing and large rearrangement analysis). 
4. To determine the exposure to olaparib in patients receiving olaparib monotherapy. 
5.  To  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  single  agent  olaparib  versus  physician’s  choice  chemotherapy 
(capecitabine, vinorelbine or eribulin). 
Exploratory objectives 
1.  To  explore  the  impact  of  olaparib  on  symptoms  and  HRQoL  as  measured  by  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30 
disease related multi-item symptom and functional scales. 
2. To explore patients’ treatment satisfaction (as measured by the Satisfaction with Therapy scale of the 
Cancer  Therapy  Questionnaire  [CTSQ]  and  the  other  subscales  and  items  of  the  CTSQ)  with  olaparib, 
compared to physician’s choice chemotherapy. 
3.  To  investigate  the  health  economic  impact  of  treatment  and  the  disease  on  hospital  related  resource 
use. 
4. To explore methods of estimating OS adjusting for the impact of the physician’s choice chemotherapy 
group  receiving  subsequent  PARP  inhibitors  or  imbalances  between  the  treatment  arms  for  other 
potentially active agents. 
5.  To  explore  whether  resistance  mechanisms  to  olaparib  can  be  identified  through  analysis  of  tumour 
and blood samples – archival tumour (mandatory if available), blood samples at baseline and on disease 
progression (mandated) and serial biopsies at baseline and disease progression (optional). 
6. To determine the frequency of and describe the nature of BRCA mutation(s) in tumour samples and to 
compare this with gBRCA mutation status. 
7. Future exploratory research into factors that may influence development of cancer and/or response to 
treatment (where response is defined broadly to include efficacy, tolerability or safety) may be performed 
on the collected and stored archival tumour samples (mandatory if available), blood samples at baseline 
and on disease progression (mandated) and serial biopsies at baseline and disease progression (optional). 
8. To collect and store DNA according to each country’s local and ethical procedures for future exploratory 
research into genes/genetic variation that may influence response (ie, distribution, safety, tolerability and 
efficacy) to study treatments and/or susceptibility to disease (optional). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
PFS: the time from randomisation until the date of objective radiological disease progression according to 
RECIST  version  1.1,  or  to  death  (by  any  cause  in  the  absence  of  disease  progression),  regardless  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 27/124 
 
  
  
 
whether  the  patient  withdraws  from  randomised  therapy  or  receives  another  cancer  therapy  prior  to 
disease progression.  
Secondary endpoints 
OS: the time from the date of randomisation until death due to any cause. 
PFS2: the time from the date of randomisation to the earliest of the progression event subsequent to that 
used for the primary variable PFS or death.  
ORR: the number of responders (CR or PR) divided by the number of patients in the treatment group in 
the EFR analysis set (ITT population with measurable disease at baseline). 
EORTC  QLQ-C30:  A  30-question  patient  reported  outcome  measure  of  HRQoL  commonly  used  in 
oncology. 
Global QoL scale: A measure of overall health and QoL consisting of 2 items from the QLQ-C30. 
TFST and TSST were also analysed as supportive endpoints for PFS and PFS2, respectively: 
Time  to  first  subsequent  therapy  (TFST):  the  time  from  randomisation  to the  earlier of  first  subsequent 
cancer therapy start date following study treatment discontinuation or death. 
Time  to  second  subsequent  therapy  (TSST):    the  time  from  randomisation  to  the  earlier  of  the  second 
subsequent therapy start date following study treatment discontinuation, or death. 
Sample size 
The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  PFS.  Approximately  310  patients  were  to  be  randomised.  The 
study  was  sized  assuming  a  true  treatment  effect  was  a  PFS  HR  of  0.635,  assuming  90%  power  and 
2.5% alpha (1-sided), with 2:1 randomisation (olaparib: physician’s choice of chemotherapy). Assuming 
PFS  was  exponentially  distributed,  a  PFS  HR  of  0.635  equated  to  a  2.3-month  improvement  in  median 
PFS over an assumed 4-month median PFS for the control arm. 
Assuming  that  the  study  accrual  period  was  approximately  22  months,  230  progression  events  were 
anticipated to be observed approximately 27 months after the first patient was randomised in the study. 
Patients  were  planned  to  be  followed  until  the  final  analysis  of  PFS2  and  OS  (when  approximately  190 
death  events  occurred).  This  was  anticipated  to  be 39  months  after  the  first  patient  was  randomised  in 
the study. 
Randomisation 
First patient enrolled: 27 March 2014 
Data cut-off date: 9 December 2016 
Prior  to  randomisation  to  olaparib  or  chemotherapy,  the  Investigator  was  required  to  declare  his  or  her 
choice  of  chemotherapy  (capecitabine,  vinorelbine,  or  eribulin).  Randomisation  was  performed  via  an 
interactive  voice  response  system/interactive  web  response  system  (IVRS/IWRS)  Centralised 
Randomisation Centre.  
Moreover, randomisation was stratified by whether patients:  
- had received prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic breast cancer (yes/no),  
- were ER and/or PgR positive versus ER and PgR negative,  
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 28/124 
 
  
  
- had prior platinum treatment for breast cancer (yes/no).  
Blinding (masking) 
Due to different routes and schedules of administration of the treatment options in the physician’s choice 
of chemotherapy arm as well as their different toxicity profiles, this study could not be blinded. Given the 
open label design of the study, rigorous methodology was employed to ensure robustness of the primary 
endpoint  assessment,  with  a  primary  analysis  of  radiological  PFS  based on  BICR  of  all  patient  screening 
and on-study scans. 
Statistical methods 
In OlympiAD, the primary population defined in the protocol for analysis of all efficacy endpoints included 
all  randomised  patients  (ie,  the  full  analysis  set  [FAS]).  Thus,  all  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  and 
HRQoL data were summarised and analysed on an intention to treat (ITT) basis. 
In  addition,  subset  analyses  to  the  main  analyses  of  PFS,  PFS2,  OS,  and  ORR  were  performed  in  those 
patients whose gBRCAm status was confirmed by the Myriad CDx test. 
Sensitivity analyses 
The  sensitivity  analyses  included  assessments  of  possible  evaluation  time  bias  (if  scans  were  not 
performed at the protocol scheduled time points), attrition bias (the possibility that the rate and nature of 
censoring  resulted  in  bias),  and  ascertainment  bias  (assessing  discrepancies  between  investigator 
assessed vs BICR assessment of PFS; hereafter referred to as investigator assessment of PFS). 
Multiplicity adjustments 
In an effort to control the type I error at 2.5% (1-sided) for key label claims, a multiple testing procedure 
(MTP) was employed across primary (PFS) and key secondary (PFS2 and OS) endpoints. 
Specifically,  PFS2  was  tested  only  after  statistical  significance  was  shown  for  PFS.  OS  was  tested  only 
after  the  null  hypotheses were  rejected  for  PFS  and  PFS2.  The  MTP  was  to  recycle  the test  mass to the 
endpoint not yet rejected in the hierarchy. 
Interim analysis of OS was carried out at the time of the primary analysis of PFS, and final OS was tested 
again  when  64%  of  deaths  occurred,  given  that  significant  PFS  and  PFS2  results  were  observed  at  the 
primary analysis. 
Primary analysis of progression-free survival 
The primary analysis of PFS was based on the BICR of the radiological scans. A sensitivity analysis of PFS 
based on Investigator-recorded assessments was also to be carried out. Progression-free survival was to 
be analysed when approximately 230 progression events had occurred, based on the BICR data. Patients 
who  had  not  progressed  or  died  at  the  time  of  analysis  were  censored  at  the  time  of  the  latest  date  of 
assessment from their last evaluable RECIST version 1.1 assessment.  
Progression-free survival was analysed using a log-rank test stratified by whether a patient had received 
prior  chemotherapy  regimens  for  metastatic  breast  cancer  (yes/no),  ER  and/or  PgR  positive  versus  ER 
and PgR negative, and prior platinum for breast cancer (yes/no), for generation of the p-value and using 
the Breslow approach for handling ties.  
Although  it  was  expected  that  there  would  be  enough  PFS  events  in  each  strata  to  allow  a  meaningful 
analysis, if a stratum for either treatment arm contains less than 5 events, then a pooling strategy had to 
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 29/124 
 
  
  
 
be employed to remove one or more stratification factors from the primary analysis. Stratification factors 
were  to  be  removed  in  the  following  order  until  were  at  least  5  events  in  each  stratum  for  either 
treatment  arm:  prior  platinum  for  breast  cancer  (yes/no),  ER  and/or  PgR  positive  versus  ER  and  PgR 
negative, prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic breast cancer (yes/no). 
The HR (olaparib versus chemotherapy), 95% CI and p-value were to be presented (an HR of less than 1 
favoured olaparib). A Kaplan-Meier plot of PFS was to be presented by treatment arm. Summaries of the 
number  and  percentage  of  patients  experiencing  a  PFS  event  and  the  type  of  event  (RECIST  or  death) 
were  to  be  provided  along  with  median  PFS  for  each  treatment  arm.  The  assumption  of  proportionality 
was  assessed.  Proportionality  was  to  be  tested  firstly  by  producing  plots  of  complementary  log-log 
(survival  function)  versus  log  (time)  and  if  these  raised  concerns,  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model 
including  a  time-dependent  covariate  would  be  fitted  to  assess  the  extent  to  which  this  represents 
random variation. 
The  estimated  PFS  rates  at  6  months  and  12  months  were  to  be  summarised  (using  the  Kaplan-Meier 
curve) and presented by treatment arm. 
Patient reported outcome (PRO) 
PRO endpoints in this open-label trial were not included in the multiplicity adjustment hierarchy so there 
is no hypothesis specified.  
The  primary  assessment  of  HRQoL  focused  on  comparing  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  the  global 
quality  of  life  (QoL)  score  (EORTC  QLQ-C30)  between  the  treatment  arms  in  the  FAS  (ITT)  set.    A  visit 
response  of  deterioration  was  defined  as  a  decrease  of  10  points  or  more  from  baseline,  or  where  the 
patient was too heavily affected by symptoms of the disease under investigation to complete the HRQoL 
at the visit. Data were descriptive and plots were used to visualise the adjusted mean global QoL/health 
status  score  over  time  for  each  treatment  arm.    95%  CI  and  p-value  were  presented  for  the  overall 
adjusted mean estimate. 
A supportive analysis of time to deterioration of HRQoL was also performed, using the same methodology 
and model as for the analysis of the primary endpoint (PFS) A Kaplan-Meier plot of time to deterioration 
of HRQoL and a summary of median time to deterioration of HRQoL were presented by treatment arm. 
To support the primary assessment of HRQoL other items of interest, data from the CTSQ-16 scores of 
treatment satisfaction (as measured by the ‘Satisfaction with Therapy’ scale and the other sub-scales and 
items of the CTSQ-16) and well as overall compliance rate were summarised. 
For  each  subscale,  if  less  than  50%  of  the  subscale  items  were  missing,  then  the  subscale  score  was 
divided by the number of non-missing items and multiplied by the total number of items on the subscales 
(Fayers et al 1999). If at least 50% of the items were missing, then that subscale was treated as missing.  
Missing  single  items  were  treated  as  missing.  If  there  was  evidence  that  the  missing  data  were 
systematic, missing values were handled to ensure that any possible bias was minimised. 
Results 
Participant flow 
This study included a 2-part screening. In Part 1, 1918 patients with unknown BRCA status were screened 
using the Myriad test to determine their BRCA status prior to enrolment. In Part 2, all other patients who 
had known BRCA status underwent a confirmatory test post-randomisation.

At the time of DCO for the primary analysis (9 December 2016), 36 (17.6%) and 3 (3.3%) patients in the 
olaparib  arm  and  physician’s  choice  of  chemotherapy  arm,  respectively,  were  still  receiving  study 
treatment. 
In the FAS, the majority of patients who discontinued study treatment did so due to disease progression. 
A  small  proportion  of  patients  discontinued  treatment  due  to  an  AE  (4.9%  on  the  olaparib  arm  versus 
7.7% on the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm).

Protocol deviations 
Overall, the proportion of patients with at least 1 important protocol deviation was 4.0%, and balanced 
between the treatment arms: 3.9% on olaparib and 4.1% on physician’s choice of chemotherapy. In 
total, 14 important protocol deviations were reported (9 and 5 in the olaparib arm and physician’s choice 
of chemotherapy arm, respectively). The most common important deviation observed in both treatment 
arms was exclusion criteria met: 5 patients (2.4%) in the olaparib arm and 4 (4.1%) in the physician’s 
choice of chemotherapy arm. 
Table 9: Important protocol deviations (FAS) 
None of the important protocol deviations were considered to have the potential to influence the overall 
study conclusions in a relevant way. The study conclusions are considered robust and representative of 
the overall study data.

Physician’s choice of chemotherapy consisting of either capecitabine, eribulin or vinorelbine. 
Patients with Missing status were not confirmed as gBRCAm using the Myriad CDx gBRCA test. Within the olaparib 
arm all 3 cases were determined as BRCA1 by local or CLIA testing and within the physician’s choice of 
chemotherapy arm 1 patient was BRCA1 and 1 patient was BRCA2. 
Metastatic disease at time of initial diagnosis of breast cancer. 
According to the electronic case report form data, 68 patients in the olaparib arm and 31 patients in the 
physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm had not received prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic breast 
cancer.  
According to the electronic case report form data, 102 patients in the olaparib arm and 47 patients in the 
physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm were ER and/or PgR positive.  Patient E2806008 did not have PgR status 
assessed but was stratified to the ER negative and PgR negative subgroup for randomisation.  The patient was 
excluded from summaries of eCRF data. 
According to the electronic case report form data, 55 patients in the olaparib arm and 21 patients in the 
physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm had prior use of platinum for breast cancer.

Six (5.8%) patients in olaparib arm and 4 (8.2%) in chemotherapy arm did not receive prior endocrine 
therapy while they were HR+. Among these patients, 4 were mis-stratified as HR+ instead of TNBC, 5 
were considered to have a disease inappropriate for endocrine therapy by the investigator (not specified 
for 1 patient, progressive breast cancer during the neoadjuvant therapy for 1 patient, low HR expression 
for 2 patients, luminal B for 1 patient), 1 were not justified. 
Previous disease-related cytotoxic chemotherapy  
The  taxanes  (docetaxel  and  paclitaxel)  were  the  most  commonly  used  followed  by  capecitabine  or 
gemcitabine for metastatic disease. Regarding prior platinum therapy, 43 (21.0%) patients in the olaparib 
arm and 14 (14.4%) in the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm had received platinum for metastatic 
disease; 15 (7.3%) patients in the olaparib arm and 7 (7.2%) in the physician’s choice of chemotherapy 
arm  had  received  platinum  for  localised  disease.  The  median  number  of  regimens  of  previous  disease-
related chemotherapy at baseline was 1.0 in both treatment arms. The number of regimens of previous 
disease-related chemotherapy at baseline (FAS) is summarized Table 13.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary variable: PFS by BICR (FAS, DCO 9 December 2016, 77.5% maturity) 
Table 18: Progression status at time of PFS analysis (DCO 9 December 2016) 
Table 19: Progression-free survival, stratified log-rank test (DCO 9 December 2016) 
a Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomisation until date of RECIST progression or death. 
Patients who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis, or who progressed or died after 2 or more missed visits, were censored

within 2 visits of baseline). 
Note: A hazard ratio of <1 favours olaparib 300 mg bd. The p-value was determined using log-rank test stratified by received previous 
chemotherapy  regimens  for  metastatic  breast  cancer  (yes/no),  and  ER  and/or  PgR  positive  versus  ER  and  PgR  negative.  The  hazard 
ratio  and  CI  were  estimated  from  the  stratified  log-rank  test  statistics.  This  analysis  was  based  on  independent  central  review  of 
radiological scans. Modified RECIST version 1.1 as per Section 5.1. Although patients were required to enter the study with at least one 
lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable) based on investigator assessment, independent reviewers may conclude NED at baseline.

Time to second progression or death (PFS2; FAS) 
In both treatment arms, of the patients who had a second progression or died, the majority were based 
on investigator-assessed radiological assessment. At the time of the primary analysis, 32.7% of olaparib-
treated patients and 24.7% of comparator-treated patients had no second progression or death event.

Patients who have not had a second disease progression or died at the time of analysis, or who have second 
progression or die after two or more missed visits, are censored at the latest evaluable assessment where they are 
known to be alive and without a second disease progression.

Patient reported outcomes/health-related quality of life (FAS) 
The  EORTC  QLQ-C30  questionnaires  were  completed  at  baseline  (prior  to  randomisation)  and  every  6 
weeks  until  disease  progression.  Baseline  compliance  rate  (99.0%  for  olaparib;  95.9%  for  physician’s 
choice of chemotherapy) and overall compliance rate (93.2% for olaparib; 77.3% for physician’s choice of 
chemotherapy) of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire were >75%. 
Change from baseline global health status/QoL score (average across all visits) was nominally statistically 
significant  in  favour  of  olaparib  treated  patients  compared  to  the  physician’s  choice  of  chemotherapy 
patients.  The  differences  in  changes  from  baseline  were  observed  across  all  visits  with  the  maximum 
difference  at  Visit  12  of  12.7  (95%  CI  5.45,  19.95).  The  overall  estimated  mean  difference  in  change 
from  baseline  global  health  status/QoL  score  was  7.5  measured  on  a  100-point  scale  (95%  CI  2.48,

Cancer therapy satisfaction questionnaire 
The primary objective of the CTSQ-16 was to assess satisfaction with the therapy and the questionnaire 
was  administered  every  6  weeks  from  baseline  and  at  treatment  discontinuation.  The  compliance  rates 
were relatively high throughout the study and never fell below 50%. 
The CTSQ-16 is scored on 0-100 scale and higher scores are associated with better therapy expectations, 
feeling  less  impact  of  side  effects,  and  greater  satisfaction  with  therapy.  Across  the  majority  of  visits, 
satisfaction  with  therapy  mean  scores  were  higher  in  the  olaparib  arm  (range  71.6  to  89.3)  compared 
with  the  physician’s  choice  of  chemotherapy  arm  (range  62.5  to 77.8).  Similar  patterns  of  higher  mean 
scores for therapy expectations and feeling less impact of side effects were observed for olaparib patients 
compared with physician’s choice of chemotherapy patients.

Additional efficacy results in patients with non-progressive disease 
There  were  70  (46  olaparib,  24  chemotherapy)  patients  enrolled  in  OlympiAD  with  non-progressive 
disease  at  randomisation  of  which,  38  patients  received  chemotherapy  other  than  platinum.    In  the  32 
patients (24 olaparib, 8 chemotherapy) with non-progressive disease at randomisation who had received 
a  prior  platinum,  20  of  the  24  olaparib-treated  patients  had  received  a  prior  platinum  in  the  metastatic 
setting and were a subset of the patients that were heavily pre-treated.

Supportive studies 
Supportive data were provided from three Phase II studies (Studies 20, 42 and D0810C00008) and two 
Phase I studies (Studies 24 and 02) in advanced cancer (one Phase II study  only included patients with 
gBRCAm  advanced  breast  cancer  [Study  D0810C00008],  and  the  other  4  studies  included  patients  with 
breast cancer as well as other solid tumours) (see Table 2). Some of the supportive studies investigated 
different  doses  and  formulations of  olaparib  and  none  included  comparators.  The  majority  of  patients  in 
the supportive studies were more heavily pre-treated compared with those in OlympiAD. 
PFS 
PFS was a secondary or exploratory efficacy outcome in Study D0810C00008, Study 24, Study 20, Study 
42 and time to progression (TTP) was a secondary efficacy outcome in Study 02. In Study D0810C00008, 
in  patients  with  gBRCAm  breast  cancer,  median  PFS  was  6.5  months  with  the  400  mg  bd  capsule  dose 
(Table  9),  which  compared  favourably  to  the  results  in  the  literature  for  an  unselected  population.  In 
Study  42,  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  gBRCAm  breast  cancer,  the  median  PFS  was  3.7  months.  In 
Study 20 and Study 02, median PFS and median TTP, respectively were longer with olaparib in patients 
with  gBRCAm  breast  cancer  compared  with  unselected  breast  cancer.  In  Study  24,  approximately  one 
third  of  patients  had  gBRCAm  breast  cancer  and  median  PFS  was  between  5  and  7  months.  Thus, 
accounting  for  the  different  degrees  of  pre-treatment  and  considering  the  limitations  of  cross-study 
comparisons  in  general,  the  PFS  on  olaparib,  as  observed  in  the  Phase  II  studies,  supports  the  results 
observed in OlympiAD. 
OS 
OS  was  a  secondary  endpoint  in  Study  42.  Median  OS  in  Study  42  was  11.01  months  (Table  9)  on 
olaparib,  which  is  shorter  than  the  median  OS  observed  in  OlympiAD.  Subsequent  therapy  use  was 
documented for 38/62 (61.3%) of patients with gBRCAm breast cancer in Study 42 and 179/298 (60.1%) 
overall. 
Other efficacy endpoints – ORR and DoR 
Results  for  ORR  for  olaparib  appeared  generally  consistent  between  the  Phase  II  studies  and  OlympiAD 
when  accounting  for  differences  in  study  populations,  such  as  different  degrees  of  pre-treatment.  As 
shown  in  Table  48,  the  majority  of  these  studies  showed  that  olaparib  had  activity  in  patients  with 
gBRCAm breast cancer and other solid tumours. In Study D0810C00008, in patients with gBRCAm breast 
cancer,  the  ORR  was  42.3%  with  the  400  mg  bd  capsule  dose.  Although  no  breast  cancer  patients  in 
Study  20  had  an  objective  response,  a  decrease  in  target  lesion  size  was  observed  in  6/8  patients  with 
gBRCAm breast cancer and only 1/14 patients with non-gBRCAm breast cancer.

Table 48: Summary of efficacy across olaparib studies: other supportive studies 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application for an extension of indication for the treatment of adult patients with BRCA1/2-mutated 
HER2-negative  metastatic  breast  cancer  is  based  on  the  results  of  the  pivotal  Phase  III,  randomised, 
controlled, open-label, multicentre study OlympiAD.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The 300 mg bd tablet dose was chosen as the recommended Phase III monotherapy dose based on 
tolerability and tumour shrinkage data from Study 24 in an advanced gBRCA mutated ovarian cancer 
population. Study 24 explored the safety data and tumour shrinkage data across a number of different 
doses and schedules of olaparib tablet or capsule in an advanced gBRCA mutated ovarian cancer 
population. This exploration resulted in the recommendation of 300 mg bd tablet dose for Phase III 
studies. This dosing regimen is expected to maintain plasma concentrations above the estimated mouse 
90% inhibitory concentration ([IC90]; and its upper 95% CI) for tumour PARP inhibition across the full 
dosing interval, i.e., 12 hours.  The recommended dose is acceptable. The exposure to olaparib following 
Assessment report

administration of 300mg bd tablet formulation observed in the Phase III study OlympiAD (Olaparib-MS-
05, N=36) was comparable to that in SOLO2 (Olaparib-MS-03, N=94) and was within the range 
previously predicted for the capsule formulation at 400mg bd (Olaparib-MS-01). In addition, in the pivotal 
phase 3 study supporting the breast cancer indication, only the currently approved tablet formulation was 
used. 
This  pivotal  study  OlympiAD  is  a  2:1  randomised,  open-label,  controlled,  multi-centre  phase  III  study 
evaluating  olaparib  monotherapy  versus  Physician’s  Choice  Chemotherapy.  The  selection  of  appropriate 
therapy  for  metastatic  breast  cancer  is  complex  because  of  the  many  treatments  options,  biologic 
heterogeneity  of  the  disease  and  prior  treatments  received  in  the  neo/adjuvant,  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  settings.  In  addition,  solid  evidence  is  lacking  as  regards  the  most  appropriate  regimens  for 
the  treatment  of  germline  BRCA  1/2  mutation  positive  breast  cancer.  The  appropriateness  of  a 
comparison with Physician’s Choice Chemotherapy is therefore endorsed.  
Physician’s  Choice  Chemotherapy  included  capecitabine,  vinorelbine  or  eribulin  as  single-agent  regimen 
used  according  to  their  marketing  authorisation  conditions.  In  patients  who  have  received  a 
taxane/anthracycline-based  regimen,  either  neo/adjuvant  or  as  first-line  treatment  for  metastatic 
disease,  it  is  accepted  from  a  regulatory  perspective  that  a  single-agent  regimen  is  used  as  reference 
mainly because of the absence of relevant data comparing sequential versus combination therapy.  
Patients with platinum resistant tumours were excluded from the study due to expected cross-resistance 
to PARP inhibitors. The absence of a platinum therapy as a treatment option is questioned as previously 
discussed  during  the  scientific  advice  procedure.  Although  carboplatin  is  mentioned  in  the  ESMO 
recommendations 
for  the  treatment  of  BRCA  mutation  positive  and  negative  mTNBC  after 
taxane/anthracycline,  the  applicant  considered that  there  were  insufficient  data  to  recommend  platinum 
agents  over  standard  chemotherapy  in  advanced  breast  cancer  (Byrski  et  al  2012).  However  the  TNT 
study  (Tutt  et  al  2014)  has  shown  a  superiority  of  carboplatin  compared  to  ‘standard’  docetaxel  in  the 
subgroup  of  patients  with  gBRCA  mutated  TNBC  with  a  significantly  better  toxicity  profile  making  it  a 
treatment  option  recommended  in  clinical  practice  guidelines  in  this  population  (3rd  ESO–ESMO 
International Consensus Guidelines for Advanced Breast Cancer). It is also acknowledged that the results 
of  TNT  study  were  not  available  at  the  start of  the  study.  Although the  absence  of  platinum  agent  as  a 
comparator  option  in  OlympiAD  study  is  considered  a  deficiency  in  the  design  of  the  study,  it  could  be 
considered as acceptable considering the timing of the study. It is noted that it is not possible to conclude 
for  the  time  being  whether  platinum  would  be  more  effective  in  first  instance  or  after  PARPi  in  this 
setting. 
The  study  population  is  heterogeneous  as  patients  could  have  received  between  0  and  2  prior  lines  of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were excluded 
from the study because of the existing therapeutic options in this population.  
Patients with ER and/or PgR positive disease were required to have received and progressed on at least 1 
endocrine  therapy  (adjuvant  or  metastatic),  or  had  disease  that  the  treating  physician  believed  to  be 
inappropriate for endocrine therapy. This inclusion criterion is not aligned with the current clinical practice 
and  recommendations  since  it  does  not  specify  if  patients  could  have  received  targeted  anticancer 
therapies such as mTOR inhibitors or CDK4/6 inhibitors. It is acknowledged that CDK4/6 inhibitors were 
not available at the time of study initiation. However, this would have been important to understand the 
place  of  olaparib  therapy  in  the  treatment  sequence  of  patients  with  gBRCA  HR+  metastatic  breast 
cancer.   
Patients with ECOG status ≥2 were excluded from the study.  This is a standard selection criterion for all 
olaparib  studies  to  safeguard  patients  who  are  in  poor  health,  as  the  need  to  attend  repeated  clinic 
appointments  and  undergo  additional  testing  associated  with  study  participation  may  be  detrimental  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 75/124 
 
  
  
their  health.  Low  numbers  of  breast  cancer  patients  with  ECOG  PS2  scores  have  received  olaparib 
treatment in earlier clinical studies. This is adequately reflected in the section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
To  be  enrolled  into  the  OlympiAD  study,  subjects  were  required  to  have  documented  evidence  of  a 
deleterious  or  suspected  deleterious  gBRCA1  or  gBRCA2  mutation.  The  presence  of  germline  BRCA1  or 
BRCA2 mutations was assumed to result in homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and sensitivity to 
olaparib  in  all  the  subgroups  (independent  on  histology,  hormone  receptor  status  or  line  of 
therapy).Evidence  of  a  qualifying  BRCA  mutation  could  be  from  either  an  existing  BRCA  mutation  result 
generated by local testing or from prospective testing performed by BGI (Chinese patients) or by Myriad 
using  either  the  Integrated  BRACAnalysis  (Myriad  CLIA  gBRCA  test)  or  BRACAnalysis  CDx  test  (non-
Chinese patients).  
Although germline BRCA1/2 mutations are neither necessary not sufficient for conferring HR-deficiency in 
breast  cancer  patients,  for  the  time  being  there  is  no  validated  biomarker  for  determining  patients  with 
homologous-recombination  deficient  tumours  and  the  development  of  tumours  in  BRCA1/2  carriers  is 
thought  to be  due to  alterations  of the  second  allele  in  BRCA1  or  2  locus  and consequently  a  functional 
deficiency  of  BRCA1  or  BRCA2  proteins  leading  to  homologous  recombination  deficiency  and  genomic 
instability.  From  this  mechanistic  point  of  view,  the  determining  factor  for  selection  of  patients  is  a 
particular genotype, namely a presence of germline BRCA mutations.  
At the time of study initiation, the inclusion of patients with a somatic mutation was not possible because 
an  appropriate  diagnostic test  based  on tissue  analysis  was  not  available.  Thus,  patients  with  a  somatic 
mutation  were  excluded  from  this  study  and  there  is  currently  no  clinical  data  available  on  the 
responsiveness  of  breast  tumours  with  somatic  BRCA  mutation  to  PARPi.  The  difficulty  to  conduct  a 
clinical  trial  only  in  patient  with  somatic  BRCA  mutated  breast  cancer  is  acknowledged  due  to  low 
prevalence.  Several  ongoing  clinical  trials  including  TAPUR,  VIOLETTE  and  LUCY  studies  in  patients  with 
either  germline  or  somatic  BRCA1/2  mutations  might  provide  relevant  data  in  this  regard.  The 
extrapolation  of  results  from  patients  with  germline  BRCA  mutations  that  developed  breast  cancer  to 
patients  with  sporadic  breast  cancers  that  harbour  somatic  BRCA  mutations  in  their  tumours  is  not 
justified  for  the  time  being  in  the  absence  of  any  clinical  data  and  other  data  supporting  the  proposed 
mechanistic  rationale  (see  also  SAG  consultation  below  in  this  regard).  Considering  the  CHMP 
assessment,  the  MAH  has  withdrawn  its  request  for  an  indication in  somatic breast  cancer  susceptibility 
genes  mutated  HER2-negative  metastatic  breast  cancer.  Data  in  patients  with  somatic  BRCA  mutations 
and  deficiencies  in  other  homologous  recombination  related  genes  are  expected  to  be  collected  in  MAH 
sponsored  and  other  studies  (TAPUR,  LUCY  and  VIOLETTE  and  new  planned  study  to  be  conducted  in 
patients with only somatic BRCAm). The MAH is recommended to provide the results of these studies.  
It  is  agreed  that  double-blind  design  is  not  an  option  due  to  obvious  differences  in  tolerability  and 
treatment schedules between the therapeutic options in the study. Measures included independent review 
and conduct of sensitivity analyses (for ascertainment bias, for deviation bias and evaluation time bias if 
scans are not performed at the protocol scheduled time points) to limit potential bias related to the open-
label nature of the trial.    
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  PFS  (supported  by  TFST).  Progression  was  assessed  by  the  blinded 
independent  central  review  (BICR)  using  RECIST  1.1.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  supported  by 
OS, PFS2 (investigator assessment), TFST, TSST and ORR (by BICR) as secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Primary and efficacy endpoints were in line with recommendations from EMA ‘Guideline on the evaluation 
of  anticancer  medicinal  products  in  man’  (EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.5)  since  when  PFS  is  the  selected 
primary endpoint, OS should be reported as a secondary endpoint.  
PFS  as  primary  efficacy  endpoint  instead  of  OS  was  discussed  during  scientific  advice  and  is  considered 
acceptable.  The  study  was  intended  to  be  performed  in  the  1st,  2nd  and  3rd  line  in  metastatic  setting 
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 76/124 
 
  
  
meaning  that  time  from  progression  on  study  therapy  to  death  will  vary.  Also,  next-line  therapies  may 
influence OS. In this context, result on PFS2 (supported by TSST) will be useful. 
The  study  was  adequately  powered  to  observe  a  2.3  months  improvement  in  median  PFS  assuming  4-
month median PFS for the control arm taking into account that median PFS for the selected comparators 
(eribulin,  vinorelbine  and  capecitabine)  varied  depending  on  agents,  line  of  therapy  and  previous 
treatments received.  
Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints were based on the ITT population [= all randomised patients 
defined as the time from randomisation to the earliest date of assessment of objective progression (per 
RECIST  criteria)  or  death  by  any  cause  (in  the  absence  of  disease  progression)]  and  included  the 
stratified  2-sided  log-rank  test  for  PFS,  PFS2  and  OS  analysis,  the  Kaplan-Meier  method  to  estimate 
median  survival  and  the  extended  Cox  regression  model  for  the  estimation  of  HR.  In  order  to  strongly 
control  the  type  I  error  at  2.5%  1-sided,  a  multiple  testing  procedure  was  also  employed  across  the 
primary endpoint and secondary endpoints intended for key label claims (i.e. PFS2 and OS).  
The  proposed  analysis  methods  for  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  are  standard  methods  in  this 
fields  in  line  with  recommendations  from  EMA  ‘Guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  anticancer  medicinal 
products in man’ (EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.5) and are therefore considered acceptable. 
Cross-over  was  not  allowed  in  this  study  as  not  considered  appropriate  since  there  were  a  number  of 
active  compounds  available  for  most  patients  and  it  could  have  a  confounding  effect  on  OS  and  PFS2. 
However, it is acknowledged that patients were able to access PARPi outside of the study. As subsequent 
therapy,  0.5%  and  8%  of  patients  have  received  a  subsequent  PARP  inhibitor  in  the  treatment  and 
comparator arm respectively, whereas 29% and 42% of patients received subsequent platinum therapy, 
respectively. 
Of the 302 patients included in the FAS, the majority were female (97.7%), white (65.2%) with a median 
age  44  years  (range  22  to  76),  ECOG  PS  0  (69.5%).  A  slightly  higher  percentage  of  patients  with  an 
ECOG  PS  1  in  the  physician’s  choice  of  chemotherapy  arm  (36.1%)  compared  with  the  olaparib  arm 
(27.8%) was observed.  
All  patients  had  metastatic  disease  as  per  protocol  requirement  with  at  least  2  metastatic  sites  in 
approximately ¾ of patients. A majority had a poorly differentiated tumour grade (54%).  
167 patients (55.3%) had a known locally confirmed gBRCA mutation: 99 BRCA1 mutations (32.8%), 67 
BRCA2 (22.2%), 1 BRCA1/2 (0.3%) and not reported for 135 patients (44.7%). 
Approximately  half  of  patients  (50.3%)  were  HR+/HER2-  and  half  of  patients  (49.7%)  were  TNBC  at 
baseline.  
The mean time from original diagnosis to randomisation in the study was approximately 5 years and 38 
days from the most recent disease progression. 
Twenty four (24) patients (11.7%) in the olaparib arm and 6 (6.2%) in the physician’s choice of 
chemotherapy received disallowed concomitant medication, mainly for treatment of bone diseases [19 
(9.3%) in the olaparib arm and 5 (5.2%) in the physician’s choice of chemotherapy]. The use of 
disallowed concomitant medication did not raise concerns about the conduct of the study.  
The  patients  randomised in  the  study  were  representative  of  the intended target  population  of  gBRCAm 
patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. The demographic and disease characteristics in the 
FAS  population  were  generally  well  balanced  between  the  two  treatment  arms.  Stratification  factors  by 
receipt of prior chemotherapy, hormone receptor status, and receipt of prior platinum therapy were also 
well balanced between the treatment arms.

At DCO for the primary analysis (9 December 2016), there was ~15% reduction risk of discontinuations 
in  olaparib  arm.  Discontinuations  were  mainly  due  to  the  disease  progression,  including  deaths.  These 
discontinuations  were  rather  well  balanced  between  both  arms  (72.7%  vs  74.7%  for  PD  and  45.9%  vs 
47.4%  for  deaths).  In  the  contrary,  there  were  66%  and  26%  reduction  risk  of  discontinuation  due  to 
patients decision and AEs respectively in olaparib arm. 
Since  ethnic/physical  characteristics  were  reported  in  the  trial,  it  was  noticed  that  very  few  Black  or 
African-American included in the trial (1.7%). The mutations rates in this population seem to be similar to 
other  populations  included  in  the  study.  The  low  recruitment  rate  was  partly  explained  by  a  lack  of 
recommendation to undergo BRCA1/2 testing in the US. The SmPC mentions in section 4.2 that there are 
limited data available in non-Caucasian patients. 
Overall, the proportion of patients with at least 1 important protocol deviation was 4.0%, and balanced 
between the treatment arms: 3.9% on olaparib and 4.1% on physician’s choice of chemotherapy. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
OlympiAD met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically relevant 3-
months improvement in PFS based on BICR in the FAS population treated with olaparib compared to 
physician’s choice of chemotherapy (HR 0.58; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.80; p<0.0001; median 7.03 vs 4.17 
months) which was supported by sensitivity analysis by investigator assessment (HR 0.50; 95% CI: 0.36, 
0.68; p=0.0009; median 7.8 vs 3.8 months).  
The improvement in PFS in the olaparib arm compared with the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm 
was  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant,  as  evidenced  by  the  magnitude  of  effect:  a  42% 
reduction in risk of progression or death. There was clear separation of curves in favour of olaparib. This 
separation appeared to start with the first radiologic assessment scheduled at 6 weeks. 
The robustness of the primary analysis is supported by sensitivities analysis (eg, ascertainment bias, 
evaluation time bias, attrition bias) demonstrating a consistent and favourable treatment benefit for 
olaparib. Discordance between BICR and investigator review for progression assessment was relatively 
low, 9% and not suggestive for major bias. Only 1 patient (0.5%) in the olaparib arm and 2 patients 
(2.1%) in the comparator arm missed ≥ 2 RECIST assessment with no impact of differential censoring 
between the 2 treatment groups.  
Following  the  subgroup  analyses  of  PFS,  no  subgroups  derived  a  differential  benefit  compared  with  the 
overall  population.  Regarding  subgroup  analyses  of  PFS,  consistent  results  were  observed  across  all the 
pre-specified subgroup. 
The design of the OlympiAD study does not allow making definitive conclusions in terms of comparison of 
efficacy of olaparib in HR+ BC vs TNBC but allows making conclusions in terms of consistency of results. 
PFS subgroup analysis results in TNBC and HR+ patients have been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Consistent  benefit  was  seen  in  both  ER  and/or  PgR  positive  and  ER  and  PgR  negative  patients  in  all 
efficacy outcomes, including PFS2 and ORR.  
gBRCA mutations are found in 10% of male breast cancer patients. Male breast cancer patients generally 
have gBRCA2 mutation. In study OlympiAD, 7 male patients were randomised (5 olaparib and 2 
comparator). At the time of the PFS analysis, 1 patient had a confirmed partial response with a duration 
of response of 9.7 months in the olaparib arm. There were no confirmed responses in the comparator 
arm. Three of the male subjects on the olaparib arm had stable disease at the DCO for the primary 
analysis and 1 male on the olaparib arm had progressive disease. While the proportion of men in the 
study program is very low, it is still considered possible to extrapolate results to men, based on the 
common biological and pharmacological rationale.

At  the  time  of  DCO  for  primary  analysis  (DCO  9  December  2016),  a  statistical  significance  on  PFS2 
improvement in the olaparib arm (HR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 – 0.87; p=0.0033) with a median second PFS 
13.17 months in the olaparib arm and 9.26 months in the comparator arm.  
Post-hoc analysis with the DCO 25 September 2017 of PFS2 (65% maturity, DCO 25 September 2017) 
was consistent (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39-0.77) with the results for PFS2 at the primary analysis. PFS2 
event rate was 63% (130/205) with a median time of 12.8 months in the olaparib arm and 67% (65/97) 
with a median time of 9.4 months in the comparator arm. The nominal p value was 0.0005, this test was 
not pre-specified under the multiplicity testing procedure. 
Final  OS  analysis  was  conducted  at  64%  maturity  of  the  FAS  population  (DCO  25  September  2017). 
There was no suggestion of an OS detriment, with the HR numerically favouring olaparib. The results of 
the  final  OS  analysis  were  consistent  the  interim  analysis  (46%  maturity  of  FAS  population).  Even  if 
switch to olaparib was not permitted within the study design OlympiAD, it is acknowledged that patients 
were  able  to  access  PARPi  outside  of  the  study.  This  has  the  potential  to  confound  interpretation  of  OS 
data.  However,  the  number  of  patient  who  received  PARPi  as  subsequent  therapy  is  relatively  low  (2 
patient (1%) in the olaparib arm and 8 (8.2%) in the comparator arm). Thus, the impact on OS analysis 
from  subsequent  PARPi  therapy  would  be  minor  and  did  not  favour  olaparib.  Subsequent  platinum 
therapy was reported in 29% of patients in the olaparib arm and in 42% of patients in the chemotherapy 
arm. There is no evidence of a differential subgroup effect on OS. 
A statistically and clinically longer TSFT and TSST in the olaparib arm than the comparator arm have been 
observed. ORR in the olaparib arm (59.9%) was doubled compared with the comparator arm (28.8%).  
Efficacy  outcomes  in  the  Myriad  CDx  gBRCAm  subgroup  (297  patients  overall;  202  in  the  olaparib  arm 
and 97 in the comparator arm) were consistent with the FAS. 
The statistically significant improvement of HRQoL (mean difference in change from baseline = 7.5 out of 
100  points  scale  95%CI  2.5,  12.4;  p=0.0035)  and  difference  in  time  to  HRQoL  deterioration  (HR  0.44; 
95%  CI  0.5,  0.77; p=0.0043) in  favour  of  olaparib  were  supported by  sensitive  analyses. However,  the 
data  from  this  open  label  are  not  considered  robust  enough  to  be  included  in  the  SmPC  based  on  the 
review of the pre-planned analyses and hypotheses for PROs including the handling of missing data.  
Only 32.5% of patients received endocrine therapy in metastatic disease and 38.4% in 
adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting while 152 patients (50.3%) were HR+ in OlympiAD study. Among the HR+ 
patients, 103 (50.2%) were treated with olaparib and 49 (50.5%) with physician’s choice of 
chemotherapy. Six (5.8%) patients in olaparib arm and 4 (8.2%) in chemotherapy arm did not receive 
prior endocrine therapy while they were HR+.  
Treatment options for patients with hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer have changed over 
the last few years, with the introduction of new endocrine therapies (new first line treatment options and 
combination therapies with CDK4/6 inhibitors) after the start of OlympiAD study. Even if eCRF in the 
OlympiAD study, did not capture how many patients had progressed on, or after, being treated with 
hormonal therapy, it is expected that all HR+ patients have a progressive disease at the time of olaparib 
initiation and HR+ patients with non-progressive disease should be excluded from the indication. Overall, 
it is considered that the indication should reflect that patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast 
cancer should also have progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy or be considered unsuitable for 
endocrine therapy in line with the studied population. 
The median of previous chemotherapy received for metastatic disease was 1 for each treatment arm.  
As required for eligibility in the study, nearly all patients had received prior treatment with anthracycline 
(unless contraindicated) and a taxane in either the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting. Patients 
had  received  prior  treatment  with  anthracycline  (unless  contraindicated)  in  the  localised  (81%)  or 
Assessment report

metastatic (19%) setting and a taxane in the localised (70%) or metastatic setting (49%). Prior therapy 
with  platinum  was  allowed  in  the  (neo)adjuvant  setting  provided the  last  dose  was  received  at  least  12 
months  prior  to  randomisation  and  in  metastatic  setting  if  there  had  been  no  evidence  of  disease 
progression during platinum treatment. Patients have received platinum either for localised disease (7% 
of  patients  in  the  olaparib  arm  and  7%  in  the  chemotherapy  arm)  or  for  metastatic  disease  (21%  of 
patients  in  the  olaparib  arm  and  14%  in  the  chemotherapy  arm)  with  the  exception  of  3  patients  (2 
olaparib and 1 comparator) who had received platinum in both settings. 
According to eligibility criteria, patients must have completed previous courses of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
more than 21 days of randomisation. Absence of progressive disease at the time of randomisation was 
reported for 46 patients in olaparib arm and 24 patients in chemotherapy arm.  
It is expected that median PFS varied depending on line of therapy and the nature of physician’s choice 
chemotherapy. The results for each of the individual chemotherapy regimens are considered as 
exploratory and showed that the treatment effects observed in individual chemotherapies were similar to 
that observed in the ITT set, with slight variations. 
Additional analyses of PFS were provided in patients who received 0 line, 1 line and 2 lines of previous CT 
in metastatic setting. HR greatly varied between subgroups of patient who received <2 prior lines of 
chemotherapy [no prior line: HR 0.50 (0.30, 0.84); one prior line: HR 0.50 (0.33, 0.76)] and subgroup of 
patients who received 2 prior lines of chemotherapy: HR 1.21 (0.69, 2.27).  
Patients who received 2 prior lines of chemotherapy for mBC treated with olaparib (57 patients) 
experienced more progression or death (87.7%) than in chemotherapy arm (24 patients; number of 
events: 58.3%) with no numerical difference in median PFS (5.7 months versus 5.1 months). Resistant 
mechanisms of PARP inhibitors should have been further investigated to better determine the optimal 
sequence of use for PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy for breast cancer and to elaborate on more 
effective therapeutic strategies in metastatic BRCAm breast cancer. Given the data indicating a lower 
response to olaparib treatment after several lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy, the efficacy outcomes in 
subgroups of patient who received no prior line vs one or 2 prior lines of chemotherapy have been 
reflected in the SmpC section 5.1.  
It is considered that anthracycline and taxane should be specified prior regimens in the indication, based 
on the proven OS benefit in the breast cancer setting for these drugs and the risk of loss of chance if not 
included. The study was performed under these conditions and no data have been produced to justify the 
extrapolation. Therefore, the indication reflects patients should have previously been treated with an 
anthracycline and a taxane in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable 
for these treatments (see SmPC sections 4.1 and 5.1). 
Absence of progressive disease at the time of randomisation was reported for 46 patients in olaparib arm 
and 24 patients in chemotherapy arm. Of the 70 patients with non-progressive disease at randomisation, 
38 patients received chemotherapy other than platinum.  In the provided post-hoc analysis of the 
subgroup of patients that had not progressed on chemotherapy other than platinum, the median PFS in 
the olaparib arm (n=22) was 8.3 months (95% CI 3.1-16.7) and 2.8 months (95% CI 1.4-4.2) in the 
chemotherapy arm (n=16) with a HR of 0.54 (95% CI 0.24-1.23). However, the number of patients is too 
limited to make meaningful conclusions on the efficacy in this subgroup (see SmPC section 5.1).  
The currently available data do not provide sufficient level of evidence whether platinum would be more 
effective in first instance or after PARPi. Data in patients with prior platinum exposure are limited and it is 
not known whether olaparib would have activity in platinum-resistant breast cancers since these patients 
have not been enrolled in the OlympiAD trial. Information on prior and subsequent platinum therapy is 
considered relevant for the prescribers and has been included in the SmPC section 5.1.

Other  chemotherapeutic  options  than  platinum  are  suggested  to  have  activity  in  HRD  tumours.  In 
particular, ‘anthracycline-sensitive’ tumours might be responsive to PARP inhibitors and/or induce cross-
resistance  diminishing  further  responsiveness  to  PARPi.  The  MAH  provided  data  on  type  of  response  to 
anthracycline  in  localised  disease  for  patients  enrolled  in  OlympiAD  trials  in  order  to  estimate  the  initial 
responsiveness of tumours to anthracyclines that have a similar mechanism of action as platinum agents 
and might be considered, similarly to platinum, as potential treatment option to target tumours with HRD 
(data not shown).  
Response  rate  for  patients  who  received  prior  anthracycline  in  localised  setting  was  13.2%  in  the 
population of patients enrolled and well balanced between arm (13.7% in the olaparib arm and 12.4% in 
the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm. However, 3 patients (1.5%) on the olaparib arm reported a 
complete response to prior anthracycline. The response rate and duration of response for patients with a 
response to prior anthracycline by platinum treatment was also presented (data not shown). Patients who 
received both prior anthracycline and platinum appear to have numerically worse outcomes than patients 
without prior exposure to platinum, indicating plausible resistance mechanisms. 
Overall, except prior platinum therapy that is known to share a similar mechanism of action supported by 
clinical  data,  it  is  not  known  whether  other  type  of  prior  chemotherapy  could  have  an  impact  on  the 
response to PARP inhibitors in progressive BRCAm metastatic breast cancer. Anthracyclines are suggested 
to have similar mechanism of action but supporting data are still limited and OlympiAD trial results do not 
allow making conclusions on the role of anthracyclines in predicting HRD in tumours or in inducing cross-
resistance when used prior to olaparib. 
The  Applicant  is  recommended  to  investigate  tumour  heterogeneity  and  mechanisms  of  resistance  to 
DNA-damaging agents that could impact the efficacy of Lynparza in different lines of therapy in patients 
with  BRCA1-  and  BRCA2-mutated  tumours  and  breast  tumours  of  particular  histological  and  molecular 
subtypes.  The  investigation  of  efficacy  in  platinum-resistant  tumours  and  comparative  efficacy  to 
platinum agents is recommended. 
Patients  with  locally  advanced  disease  with  a  generally  better  prognosis  have  not  been  included  in  the 
pivotal trial, but the extrapolation to this patient population was considered acceptable by the CHMP given 
a similar clinical management for locally advanced and metastatic disease and based on a biological and 
pharmacological rationale. 
Despite the relatively small sample size and the more advanced stage of disease of the patients included 
in the supportive studies, the data collected in patients with gBRCAm breast cancer from these studies is 
considered supportive.  
Results  reported  in  early  phase  trials  with  capsule  formulation  of  olaparib  appear  to  be  inconsistent  in 
terms of ORR reported in patients with germline BRCA mutations (varying from no response to 42.3% of 
ORR).  
Additional expert consultation 
The SAG Oncology was consulted on the following aspects. 
1.  Can the efficacy of olaparib, demonstrated by selecting patients through gBRCA 
mutations in blood samples, be extrapolated to patients with tumors exhibiting only 
sBRCA mutations? 
The majority of the SAG agreed that the validity of extrapolating the efficacy associated with PARP 
inhibitors observed in patients with germline BRCA mutations to patients with tumours with somatic 
BRCA mutations is only a hypothesis. Clinical data are lacking and extrapolating from the experience 
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019

in ovarian cancer mainly based on the mechanism of action may not be appropriate in view of 
potential different tumour biology in terms of tumour microenvironment, immune system 
involvement, etc., between gBRCA- and sBRCA-associated breast cancers, and also considering that 
previous exposure to platinum differs in ovarian and breast cancer. Even if the BRCA-mutation is 
likely to be of great biological importance, the BRCA mutations per se may not be a sufficient “driver” 
for tumorigenesis in sBRCA-associated breast cancer. Other factors are probably involved, such as the 
extent of tumour heterogeneity and if somatic BRCA loss is an early or late event, TP53 
abnormalities, etc. Thus, the effect of olaparib in tumours harbouring only a somatic mutation, 
although an effect is biologically plausible, might be qualitatively or quantitatively different from the 
effect in gBRCA-associated breast cancer. In conclusion, there is uncertainty about both the 
treatment effect and a potentially differential side effect profile for sBRCA-associated breast cancer in 
comparison with gBRCA-associated disease. 
According to a minority of SAG members, however, although acknowledging the challenges expressed 
above, given that the effect of somatic mutation is in terms of phenotype is similar to what is seen 
with a germline mutation, it seems counter-intuitive that the response would be different for somatic 
v. germline BRCA mutated breast cancer. Safety advantages might also be hypothesized as the drug 
would act more specifically on cancer cells (albeit not observed in ovarian cancer).  
The SAG agreed that further clinical studies, even just looking at response rate and duration in 
patients with tumours harbouring somatic mutations, are needed in order to support the hypothesis 
of sBRCA as a treatment predictive factor in patients with breast cancer. Observational studies 
(registries) might also be useful to explore this hypothesis. Studies should also investigate the 
incidence of MDS and AML. 
The SAG further noted that the control group of the pivotal clinical study excluded the use of a 
platinum-containing regimen, which is considered more efficacious than the physician’s choice 
monotherapies used in the pivotal trial. Thus, a smaller effect of PARP-inhibition would be expected 
compared to current standard treatments (although the toxicity profile is likely improved compared to 
platinum-containing regimen). Furthermore, the compliance in the physician’s choice arm indicated 
problems. Whether a PARP-inhibitor is more efficacious than platinum-containing regimens in the 
population of gBRCA-associated metastatic breast cancer has not been established. 
2.  Can efficacy be extrapolated from patients with gBRCA mutations to those with 
tumours displaying germline/somatic mutations in other genes potentially impacting 
HRD status? 
Given the challenges expressed above regarding extrapolation to tumours harbouring somatic 
mutations and the less clear role for other mutations and other mechanisms causing HRD, further 
extrapolation is not considered justified. 
3.  What methods for establishing the HRD status of breast cancers are appropriate and 
available? 
Currently, multiple different HRD assays have been explored. No studies of the effect of PARP-
inhibitors using HRD as a treatment predictive marker has been presented. Thus, no HRD assay can 
be considered having clinical validity and utility for predicting PARP inhibitor sensitivity.   
4.  What methods for establishing the BRCA1/2 locus-specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 
are appropriate and available? Is there an established relationship between the extent 
of LOH and the degree HRD in BRCA1/2 germline mutation-associated and sporadic 
breast tumours?

There are methods available in a research setting, to test for BRCA1/2 locus-specific loss of 
heterozygosity; however, the SAG could not confirm to what extent any particular test is well-
established. Furthermore, the relationship between LOH and HRD in germline mutation-associated 
and sporadic breast tumours is unclear, and mechanisms apart from LOH do operate in gBRCA-
associated breast cancer as a mechanism for biallelic inactivation of BRCA1 and BRCA2, so the clinical 
utility of such tests over BRCA testing is not likely to be important in the context of treatment effect 
with PARP inhibition. 
5.  What is the likelihood of non-HRD tumours in patients with gBRCA mutations and HER2-
/hormone-receptor positive disease? Does this possibility give rise to further diagnostic 
considerations?  
There are no data to quantify the rate of “sporadic” cancer in germline mutation carriers, i.e. non-
hereditary breast cancers occurring as a consequence of other mechanisms apart from the BCRA 
mutation in a germ line mutation carrier. Such cancers certainly exist, but in general, this is not 
considered to be of such clinical importance as to warrant further diagnostic considerations. 
6.  Could other genotype/phenotype features of breast tumours (e.g. molecular subtype, 
tumour grade, concomitant mutations, platinum/other chemotherapy sensitivity) 
indicate HRD, similarly to ovarian cancers? 
The SAG was not aware of any patient, tumour, or treatment characteristics that could be used as a 
present valid indication of HRD; further clinical data are required. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the different efficacy outcomes in the pivotal OlympiAD study support efficacy of olaparib 
for the treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA1/2-mutations who have HER2 negative metastatic 
breast  cancer.  There  was  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  PFS,  with  supportive  data  for  PFS2, 
TFST  and  TSST  in  favour  of  olaparib  at  the  time  of  primary  analysis.  There  was  no  indication  on  a 
detrimental  effect  on  OS  at  interim  and  final  analysis  at  64%  maturity,  with  HR  numerically  favouring 
olaparib. 
For  the  time  being,  there  is  no  clinical  data  available  on  the  responsiveness  of  breast  tumours  with 
somatic BRCA mutation to PARPi and the extrapolation is not supported in the context of different types 
of breast cancer. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Across  the  entire  clinical  programme,  as  of  15  December  2017,  8319  patients  are  estimated  to  have 
received treatment with olaparib.  
The OlympiAD study provides the main safety data for the use of olaparib 300 mg bd therapy in patients 
with HER2-negative metastatic gBRCAm breast cancer. The OlympiAD data are supported by safety data 
from  patients  receiving  olaparib  monotherapy  at  300  mg  bd  (as  a  continuous  dose)  in  an  additional  10 
studies, corresponding to a total of 759 patients with advanced solid tumours.  
The  majority  of  patients  in  the  300  mg  bd  pool  had  either  ovarian,  fallopian  tube  or  primary  peritoneal 
cancer  (335/759  [44.1%]  patients)  or  breast  cancer  (268/759  [35.3%]  patients).  Patients  with  other 
advanced solid tumours, including colon/colorectal (n=23), pancreas (n=12) or prostate (n=11) cancers

were also treated in these studies. Patients were also being treated for different stages of their disease. 
Data are summarised regardless of BRCA mutation status.

A total of 302 patients were randomised in OlympiAD, 205 were randomised to the olaparib arm and 97 
to  the  physician’s  choice  of  chemotherapy  arm.  All  of  the  205  patients  randomised  to  olaparib  received 
study  treatment.  Of  the  91  patients  who  received  treatment  in  the  physician’s  choice  of  chemotherapy 
arm,  41  (42.3%)  patients  received  capecitabine,  34  (35.1%)  patients  received  eribulin  and  16  (16.5%) 
patients received vinorelbine. Six patients randomised to the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm did 
not receive any treatment and were therefore excluded from the SAS.

Other significant events 
Important potential risks 
MDS/AML, pneumonitis and new primary malignancies are important potential risks (see RMP).Reports for 
events of MDS/AML and new primary malignancies continue to be collected beyond 30 days after the last 
dose of olaparib, by use of targeted safety questionnaire, and can be reported at any point in OS follow-
up.Since  MDS/AML,  pneumonitis  and  new  primary  malignancies  occur  at  low  frequency,  to  improve  the 
sensitivity and precision of estimates to characterise these important potential risks, information has been 
drawn from larger pools of olaparib studies: 
Olaparib  monotherapy  combined  therapeutic  dose  pool  (n=1525  patients)  consists  of  all  patients  who 
have  received  olaparib  as  a  monotherapy  treatment  (tablet  or  capsule  formulation)  at  the  therapeutic 
dose  (ie,  300  mg  bd  tablet  formulation  or  400  mg  bd  capsule  formulation  as  a  continuous  dose).  All 
patients  from  the  300  mg  bd  pool  are  included  in  the  olaparib  monotherapy  combined  therapeutic  dose 
pool.  
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 101/124 
 
  
  
 
Olaparib monotherapy all doses pool (n=1957 patients) consists of all patients who have received at least 
1 dose of olaparib as a monotherapy treatment (tablet or capsule formulation) at any dose. In addition, 
66 patients from Study 41 are included. All patients from the olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic 
dose pool are included in the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool. 
Entire clinical programme as of 15 December 2017 (n=8319 patients): This pool includes all the studies 
shown  in  Table  1,  any  studies  where  olaparib  is  given  in  combination  with  other  anticancer  treatments, 
investigator-sponsored studies (ISSs) and data from the managed access programme (MAP).

New primary malignancies 
In the OlympiAD study, there was 1 event of new primary malignancy reported in the olaparib arm (0.5% 
of  patients)  compared  with  no  event  in  physician’s  choice  of  chemotherapy  arm.  The  olaparib-treated 
patient  had  an  AE  of  malignant  melanoma  in  situ  of  CTCAE  Grade  1;  this  was  a  non-serious  event  in  a 
patient  who  had  a  medical  history of  melanoma  and  which  was  reported  as  resolved  after  a  duration  of 
one day.

Analysis of other adverse drug reactions (OlympiAD SAS) 
Hematologic toxicities 
Anaemia 
AEs of anaemia were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm (40.0%) compared 
with the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm (26.4%). These events were predominantly Grade 1 or 
2 in severity, rarely led to permanent discontinuation of treatment (2.0%), were manageable by standard 
supportive therapies, and generally resolved whilst on treatment. 
CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 anaemia was reported in 33 (16.1%) patients in olaparib arm vs. 4 (4.4%) patients in 
the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm. 
Onset  of  anaemia  was  early,  generally  in  the  first  3  months  of  starting  olaparib  (median  time  to  onset 
was 1.45 months), although the risk of developing anaemia remained fairly constant throughout exposure 
with  no  evidence  of  cumulative  effect;  the  majority  (64  of  82  patients)  of  first  events  with  olaparib 
resolved (median duration of resolution 1.36 months).  
In  total,  37  (18.0%)  patients  in  the  olaparib  arm,  and  5  (5.5%)  patients  in  the  physician’s  choice  of 
chemotherapy arm had blood transfusions. 
Approximately  half  of  the  patients  in  the  olaparib  arm  with  anaemia  (38  [46.3%]  of  82  patients)  were 
treated  for  the  AE  compared  with  approximately  one  third  of  patients  in  the  physician’s  choice  of 
chemotherapy arm (7 [29.2%] of 24 patients). 
Gastrointestinal toxicity 
Nausea and vomiting 
AEs of nausea and vomiting were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm (58.0% 
and 32.2% respectively) compared with the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm (35.2% and 15.4% 
respectively)  in  OlympiAD.  These  events  were  predominantly  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity  and  none  led  to 
permanent discontinuation of treatment in the olaparib arm. 
A total of 54 (26.3%) olaparib-treated patients reported both nausea and vomiting. Approximately half of 
the olaparib-treated patients with nausea (63 [52.9%] of 119 patients) were treated for the AE and one 
third (22 [33.3%] of 66 patients) with vomiting received treatment. 
Events  of  nausea  and  vomiting  were  generally  reported  early  in  the  treatment  period  (median  time  to 
onset was 0.16 months and 0.87 months, respectively) and the majority (109 of 119 AEs of nausea and 
63 of 66 AEs of vomiting) of first events with olaparib resolved (median duration of 1.12 months and 0.07 
months, respectively). 
Cough 
AEs  of  cough  (grouped  term  consisting  of  cough  and  productive  cough)  were  reported  for  a  higher 
percentage  of  patients  in  the  olaparib  arm  (18.0%)  than  the  physician’s  choice  of  chemotherapy  arm 
(7.7%).  There  was  no  association  between  the  reporting  of  AEs  of  cough  and  the  length  of  time  on 
olaparib  treatment.  In  the  OlympiAD  study,  AEs  of  cough  in  the  olaparib-treated  arm  were  reported 
throughout the study period (median time to first onset was 3.12 months [range 0.20 to 19.45 months]); 
the majority (28 of 37 patients) of first events with olaparib resolved (median duration of 1.02 months).

Laboratory findings 
In  OlympiAD,  the  changes  in  haematological  laboratory  parameters  reported  were  generally  mild  or 
moderate in severity. 
No patients in OlympiAD had CTCAE Grade 4 haemoglobin values during the study in both arms; 16.6% 
of olaparib-treated patients had decreases to CTCAE Grade 3 haemoglobin values compared with 3.3% of 
patients in the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm. 
A  low  proportion  of  olaparib-treated  patients  (9  patients  [4.4%])  had  CTCAE  Grade  ≥3  reductions  in 
platelet count during the study; no patients in the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm had a CTCAE 
Grade ≥3 reduction in platelet count. 
The  majority  of  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  in  OlympiAD  had  a  maximum  CTCAE  Grade  of  ≤  2 
reported for leukocyte laboratory values thoughout treatment. 
The  majority  of  olaparib-treated  patients  in  OlympiAD  had  a  maximum  grade  of  ≤2  reported  for 
neutrophil  laboratory  values.  Moreover,  9.9%  of  olaparib-treated  patients  had  decreases  to  CTCAE 
Grade≥3  neutrophil  values  whereas  approximately  one-third  of  patients  in  the  physician’s  choice  of 
chemotherapy arm had CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 absolute neutrophil count (ANC) during the OlympiAD study. 
The majority of patients in OlympiAD had a maximum CTCAE Grade of ≤2 reported for lymphocyte 
laboratory values throughout treatment. The proportion of patients with CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 reductions in 
lymphocyte count during the study was higher for the olaparib arm (36 of 165 patients [21.8%]) than for 
the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm (2 patients [2.8%]). 
Potential for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) 
There were no confirmed or suspected Hy’s Law cases. 
In  the  OlympiAD  study,  the  majority  of  patients  in  the  olaparib  arm  and  the  physician’s  choice  of 
chemotherapy  arm  had  AST  (188/205  [91.7%]  and  84/91  [92.3%]  patients,  respectively)  and  ALT 
(191/205  [93.2%]  and  79/91  [86.8%]  patients,  respectively)  below  3  ×  ULN.  The  majority  of  patients 
with  AST  or  ALT  values  above  3  ×  ULN  in  OlympiAD  had  values  ≥3  ×  ULN  to  <5  ×  ULN,  both  for  the 
olaparib arm and the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm. ALT and AST values in the range of ≥10 × 
ULN to <20 × ULN were each reported for 1 olaparib-treated patient; no patients in the physician’s choice 
of  chemotherapy  arm  had  values  outside  the  range  of  ≥5  ×  ULN  to  <10  ×  ULN.  No  patient  in  either 
treatment arm had an AST or ALT value of ≥20 × ULN. 
There were 6 (3.0%) patients in the olaparib arm who had a laboratory value of AST elevation of CTCAE 
Grade  3  (worst  grade),  and  4  (2.0%)  patients  with  CTCAE  Grade  3  elevated  ALT  (worst  grade)  during 
treatment. In general, AST and ALT elevations in all 6 patients were transient in nature and resolved on 
continued treatment. 
An  assessment  of  ALT,  AST  maximal  elevations  during  treatment  by  maximal  total  bilirubin  elevations 
showed that 1 (0.5%) patient in the olaparib arm and 2 (2.2%) physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm 
had  concurrent  elevation  of  bilirubin  and  either  ALT  or  AST.  The  olaparib-treated  patient  had  transient 
concurrent elevated AST (CTCAE Grade 2) and bilirubin (> 2 x ULN) at Visit 10 (Day 129). No AEs were 
reported  for  this  patient  at  the  time  of  these  laboratory  findings.  There  were  no  dose  interruptions  or 
dose  reductions  and  AST  and  ALT  values  were  both  normal  at  the  next  visit.  The  patient  had  hepatic 
metastases at screening. 
In the 300 mg bd pool, the majority (695 [91.8%] patients) had combined AST or ALT below 3 × ULN. 
AST  or  ALT  values  above  3  ×  ULN  were  reported  infrequently  (37  [4.9%]  patients  had  values  of  >3  × 
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019

ULN to ≤5 × ULN; 17 [2.2%] patients had values >5 × ULN to ≤10 × ULN; 7 [0.9%] patients had values 
>10 × ULN to ≤20 × ULN, and 1 [0.1%] patient had a value of >20 × ULN). 
In the 300 mg bd pool, the proportion of patients who had an AST or an ALT laboratory value of CTCAE 
Grade 3 is similar to that in the olaparib arm of the OlympiAD study (3.0% and 2.0% respectively). 
An assessment of combined elevations of ALT and bilirubin was conducted for all patients in the 300 mg 
bd pool. Of these 759 patients, 15 (2.0%) reported elevations of both AST and ALT >3 × ULN and total 
bilirubin >2 × ULN, irrespective of ALP, at any point during their study treatment. A detailed evaluation of 
medical history, progression of disease, temporal association with elevated ALP (>2 × ULN for 8 patients 
and <1 × ULN for 1 patient) and other factors showed that all 9 patients had alternative explanations for 
elevations of ALT and bilirubin, generally suggestive of obstructive causes, or cancer disease progression, 
including disease progression in the liver. 
Increase in creatinine 
In the olaparib arm of OlympiAD, 96.1% of olaparib-treated patients had normal creatinine levels at 
baseline, 3.4% had CTCAE Grade 1 at baseline and 0.5% had CTCAE Grade 2 at baseline. A total of 
31/204 (15.2%) patients had a single change in CTCAE Grade (most changes were normal to Grade 1) 
and no patients had 2 grade shifts in CTCAE Grade for creatinine; 1 patient had a shift from normal at 
baseline to CTCAE Grade 3 on treatment (this patient had hydronephrosis at baseline; no patients had a 4 
grade shift. 
Data from all patients in the 300 mg bd pool showed that a higher proportion of patients in the tablet 
pool had CTCAE grade shifts in creatinine, compared with OlympiAD. In the 300 mg bd pool, 90.0% of 
olaparib-treated patients had normal creatinine at baseline, 9.2% had CTCAE Grade 1 at baseline and 
0.7% had CTCAE Grade 2 at baseline. A total of 594/757 (78.5%) patients had a single change in CTCAE 
Grade (changes were normal to Grade 1 in 568 of the 591 patients) and 96/757 (12.7%) had 2 CTCAE 
grade shifts (all were normal to Grade 2); one patient (0.1%) had a 3 grade shift in creatinine (from 
Grade 0 to Grade 3). 
Safety in special populations 
Effect of age 
Table 71 shows the distribution of AEs by patient age.

An analysis of AEs by the SOCs most relevant to elderly patients, and age is provided in Table 71. For the 
majority of the AEs, there were no differences in frequency of AEs by PT in patients aged <65 years when 
compared with patients aged 65 to 74 years and patients aged 75 to 84 years. ALT increased, leukopenia, 
headache and nausea were the only AEs that occurred at a higher incidence (≥5% difference) in the <65 
years category compared with 65 to 74 and 75 to 84 year categories. For the 65 to 74 years age 
category, AEs that occurred at a higher incidence (≥5% difference) when compared with <65 years age 
category were: fatigue, oedema peripheral and urinary tract infection. For the 75 to 84 years age 
category, AEs that occurred at a higher incidence (≥5% difference) when compared with <65 years were:

Effect of race 
Safety data are presented for the 168 non-White patients who received the proposed dose of 300 mg bd 
as a monotherapy across the clinical programme. The majority of these patients 155 (92.3%) were of 
Asian origin, 5 (3.0%) patients were of Black or African American origin and 8 (4.8%) were of other racial 
origin.

and non-White patients) in the 300 mg bd pool 
AEs  that  occurred  at  a  higher  incidence  in  non-White  patients  (≥5%  difference)  compared  with  White 
patients  were:  ALT  increased,  anaemia,  AST  increased,  malaise,  neutrophil  count  decreased,  platelet 
count decreased, upper respiratory tract infection and WBC count decreased. 
AEs with a CTCAE Grade ≥3 that occurred at a higher incidence in non-White patients (≥5% difference) 
compared  with  White  patients  were:  anaemia,  neutrophil  count  decreased,  and  WBC  count  decreased. 
Anaemia and WBC count decreased were the only AEs that resulted in a dose modification that occurred 
at a higher incidence in non-White patients (≥5% difference) compared with White patients.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were similarly low in OlympiAD and in the 300 mg bd 
pool, and were reported for 4.9% and 6.6% of patients respectively.  In the physician’s choice 
chemotherapy arm, AEs leading to discontinuation of the study treatment were reported in 7.7% of 
patients. The most common SOCs reported for AEs leading to discontinuation were blood and lymphatic 
disorders. Anaemia was the most common AE leading to discontinuation in OlympiAD and in the 300 mg 
bd pool. 
Dose reductions/interruptions due to adverse events 
Dose interruptions or delay and dose reductions were reported respectively in 50.7% and 26.8% patients 
on olaparib and respectively in 38.5% and 30.8% patients on physician's choice of chemotherapy. A 
numerically higher proportion of patients in the olaparib arm (35.1%) had a dose interruption due to an 
AE compared with the proportion of patients in the physician's choice of chemotherapy arm (26.4%). 
However, a numerically lower proportion of patients in the olaparib arm (25.4%) compared to the 
physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm (30.8%) had a dose reduction due to an AE. 
AEs leading to dose reductions were reported for 134 (17.7%) of patients for the 300 mg bd pool and AEs 
leading to dose interruption were reported for 239 (31.5%) of patients for the 300 mg bd pool.  
The types of AEs leading to dose modifications (anaemia, vomiting, neutropenia, nausea and fatigue) 
were comparable with those observed in OlympiAD. 
Post marketing experience 
The capsule formulation of olaparib is currently approved in more than 50 countries worldwide for the 
treatment of patients with ovarian cancer. The tablet formulation is approved in the US and Japan for 
patients with PSR ovarian cancer and was recently approved in the US for patients with gBRCAm HER2-
negative metastatic breast cancer. The reports received do not change the benefit-risk profile of olaparib.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Across the entire clinical programme, as of 15 December 2017, an estimated 8319 patients are estimated 
to have received treatment with olaparib. The safety of olaparib 300 mg bid tablet is mainly based on the 
phase III OlympiAD study. The OlympiAD data have been pooled with the data from patients receiving 
olaparib 300 mg bid tablet in additional 10 monotherapy studies providing a pooled safety database of 
about 759 patients (268 of whom had breast cancer). These safety data are considered supplementary to 
the presentation of data from the OlympiAD study. 
The majority of patients exposed to olaparib reported adverse events (AEs), which were generally mild to 
moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation. The toxicity of olaparib was manageable, 
including by dose interruptions, dose reductions and standard supportive treatment as required. The 
safety findings in olaparib arm of OlympiAD were consistent with the 300 mg bid pool. 
In study OlympiAD, the median total treatment duration was more than twice as long in the olaparib arm 
(approximately 8.2 months) compared with the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm (approximately 
3.4 months). 27.8% of patients in the olaparib arm remained on treatment for ≥1 year compared with 
9.9% of patients in the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 110/124 
 
  
  
The most common AEs in the olaparib arm were: nausea (58.0%), anaemia (39.5%), vomiting (32.2%), 
fatigue (29.8%), diarrhoea (20.5%), headache (20.5%), neutropenia (18.0%), cough (17.1%), 
decreased appetite (17.1%), WBC decreased (16.1%), pyrexia (14.6%), back pain (14.6%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (13.2%), constipation (12.7%), neutrophil count decreased (11.2%), ALT 
increased (11.7%), arthralgia (11.2%) and leukopenia (11.2%). 
It can be noticed than in OlympiAD, anaemia, nausea and vomiting were reported at a significantly higher 
frequency in olaparib arm than in the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm whereas neutropenia, PPE 
syndrome and alopecia were reported at a significantly higher frequency in the physician’s choice of 
chemotherapy arm than in olaparib arm.  
In OlympiAD, approximately 40% of patients in either treatment arm of the OlympiAD study had AEs 
leading to either dose reduction or dose interruptions/delays. The proportion of patients who had AEs 
leading to either dose reduction or dose interruptions were similar for OlympiAD and the 300 mg bd pool.  
The proportion of patients who reported AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment was low in both 
treatment arms. 
Grade ≥3 AEs had a higher incidence in the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm (49.5% of patients) 
than in the olaparib arm (38.0%). Anaemia and neutropenia were the only AEs Grade ≥3 reported in 
≥5% of patients in the olaparib arm (respectively 15.6% and 5.4% in the olaparib arm vs. 4.4% and 
13.2% in the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm). AEs of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher were similar and 
occurred at similar frequencies in olaparib between treatment arm of OlympiAD and the 300 mg bid pool. 
SAEs were reported in a similar proportion of patients in the olaparib arm (16.6%) compared with the 
physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm (16.5%). The highest frequency of reported SAEs at the system 
organ class (SOC) level was blood and lymphatic system disorders (2.9% olaparib vs. 6.6% physician’s 
choice of chemotherapy). The most common SAE in both arms was anaemia (2.4% olaparib vs 2.2% 
physician’s choice of chemotherapy). The only SAEs considered by the Investigator to be causally related 
to olaparib in >1 patient was anaemia (5 [2.4%] patients). The only other SAEs reported in ≥2 patients 
in olaparib arm only were: dyspnoea (1.5%), pyrexia (1.5%), neutrophil count decreased (1.0%) and 
platelet count decreased (1.0%). The majority of SAEs had resolved with either no action taken or 
following a temporary dose interruption or delay/dose change, or were recovering. SAEs were reported at 
a similar frequency in OlympiAD and in the 300 mg bd pooled dataset. 
Most deaths occurring on study were related to the disease under investigation with only one patient in 
the olaparib arm with an AE leading to death (sepsis) which was not considered related to study 
treatment by the Investigator. The frequency of deaths for any reason was similar for olaparib-treated 
patients over patients in the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm (63.4% vs. 63.9% respectively). 
The frequency of deaths for any reason was twice as large as for olaparib-treated patients (63.4%) in 
OlympiAD over the 300 mg bd pool (27.0%). But the majority of deaths concern death related to disease 
under investigation which was twice as many in the olaparib arm than in the physician’s choice of 
chemotherapy arm (respectively 58.5% and 25.0%). 
The adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified for olaparib tablets are the same as previously described in 
the SmPC of olaparib. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been revised to reflect updated frequencies based on 
pooled data from 1525 patients with solid tumours treated with lynparza monotherapy in clinical trials at 
the recommended dose. The most frequently observed adverse reactions across clinical trials in patients 
receiving Lynparza monotherapy (≥ 10%) were nausea, fatigue (including asthenia), vomiting, anaemia, 
diarrhoea, decreased appetite, headache, cough, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, neutropenia, dizziness, and 
leukopenia. 
Back pain was the only AE not listed as an ADR that occurred at a frequency of 10% in the olaparib 300 
mg bd arm and a 5% or greater frequency compared with the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 111/124 
 
  
  
However, back pain is a common disease-related symptom in metastatic breast cancer patients and the 
event rate data suggests that the difference in crude incidence observed in OlympiAD is likely due to 
differences in exposure/observation time between arms. 
The adverse events of special interest (AESIs) for olaparib are myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/AML, 
pneumonitis and new primary malignancies. These adverse events have been classified in the RMP as 
important potential risks supported by pharmacovigilance activities. 
Investigators in OlympiAD were required to record MDS/AML and new primary malignancies events 
beyond 30 days after the last dose of olaparib at any point in OS follow-up. A causal relationship between 
olaparib treatment and the development or acceleration of MDS/AML, new primary malignancies and 
pneumonitis has not been established. 
There were no reports of MDS or AML in either treatment arm of OlympiAD, either on treatment, or within 
the 30-day follow-up period.  
In  the  OlympiAD  study,  there  was  1  event  of  new  primary  malignancy  (malignant  melanoma  in  situ  of 
CTCAE  Grade  1)  reported in  the  olaparib  arm  (0.5%  of  patients)  compared  with  no  event  in  physician’s 
choice  of  chemotherapy  arm.  The  incidence  of  new  primary  malignancies  in  the  pool  of  patients  who 
received olaparib in monotherapy studies (tablet and capsule formulations; all doses of olaparib) is 1.23% 
for  olaparib  (24  patients  in  a  total  of  1957 patients,  of  whom  13 patients  had  skin  cancers).There  have 
also  been  reports  of  new  primary  malignancies  from  post  marketing  surveillance,  consistent  with  the 
characterisation  of  the  events  reported  from  monotherapy  clinical  studies.  Patients  enrolled  into  the 
olaparib  clinical  studies  had  already  received  prior  chemotherapy  with  multiple  cycles  of  platinum 
containing chemotherapy. Whilst it is not possible to exclude a contribution of olaparib, there were other 
contributory factors for all reports. 
In the OlympiAD study, there were no pneumonitis cases reported. There were 8 patients with events of 
pneumonitis in the pool of patients who received olaparib in monotherapy studies (tablet and capsule 
formulations; all doses of olaparib) giving an incidence rate of 8 in 1525 patients (0.52%). 
Regarding laboratory parameters, changes in haemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and mean 
corpuscular volume were the only significant haematological parameters with clinically relevant changes; 
these parameters are recognised ADRs for olaparib. Anaemia is the only one important identified risk in 
the  RMP,  whereas  neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia  are  no  longer  considered  as  important  identified 
risk in the RMP. 
Additional  safety  measures  have  been  incorporated  into  the  Phase  III  programme  and  these  measures 
have  also  been  implemented  where  olaparib  is  marketed:  specified  haematological  values  are  required 
before inclusion into the studies or treatment and regular monitoring is continued while on treatment to 
detect haematological abnormalities early. In case of, prolonged cytopenias, patients are to be referred to 
a  haematologist  and  bone  marrow  analysis  should  be  considered.  If  a  diagnosis  of  MDS  is  confirmed, 
olaparib treatment must be discontinued and the event, treatment, course and outcome must be reported 
as  an  SAE.  Based  on  the  updated  analysis  of  MDS/AML,  with  a  DCO  date  of  15  December  2017,  these 
measures  are  considered  to  remain  appropriate  for  minimization  of  the  risk  for  MDS/AML,  and  do  not 
require  any  further  amendment.  Section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  has  also  been  updated  to  reflect  that  the 
incidence of MDS/AML cases was similar among gBRCA1m and gBRCA2m patients (1.4% versus 1.6%). 
At the exception of anaemia and neutropenia (see above, paragraph on AEs grade ≥ 3) the changes in 
the laboratory values for the haematology parameters in the olaparib arm were generally reported in low 
numbers of patients with a maximum CTCAE Grade of 3 or 4 (leukopenia 2.4%, neutrophil count 4.9%, 
%, WBC decreased 3.4% and platelet count decreased 2.4%). These changes in haematological 
parameters are generally mild or moderate, manageable, and reversible. 
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 112/124 
 
  
  
The  only  significant  change  in  clinical  chemistry  parameters  occurred  for  creatinine:  increase  in  blood 
creatinine  is  a  recognised  ADR  for  olaparib  and  is  no  longer  considered  important  identified  risk  in  the 
RMP.  AEs  of  increased  creatinine  were  predominantly  Grade  1  in  severity  and  none  led  to  permanent 
discontinuation  of  treatment.  The  laboratory  observations  of  elevated  serum  creatinine  were  not 
associated with renal impairment and had apparently no clinical sequelae. The changes in creatinine are 
consistent with the finding that olaparib is known to be an inhibitor of organic cation-transporter (OCT)-2 
and multi-drug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE)-1. 
No hepatobiliary or renal safety concerns were identified from a review of laboratory and AE data. 
Regarding  special  populations,  although  there  are  limited  data  in  elderly  patients  ≥75  years  of  age, 
assessment of the safety of olaparib in patient subgroups showed an acceptable safety profile regardless 
of age, race, gender, or body weight. No dose adjustment is required on the basis of patient age, racial 
origin, gender or body weight.  
Based  on  the  mode  of  action  of  olaparib,  women  of  childbearing  potential  should  not  become  pregnant 
while  on  Lynparza  and  not  be  pregnant  at  the  beginning  of  treatment.  A  pregnancy  test  should  be 
performed on all women of childbearing potential prior to treatment and considered regularly throughout 
treatment. 
Women  of  childbearing  potential  must  use  two  forms  of  reliable  contraception  before  starting  Lynparza 
therapy,  during  therapy  and  for  1  month  after  receiving  the  last  dose  of  Lynparza,  unless  abstinence  is 
the chosen method of contraception (see section 4.4). Two highly effective and complementary forms of 
contraception are recommended. 
Since it cannot be excluded that olaparib may reduce exposure to substrates of CYP2C9 through enzyme 
induction, the efficacy of some hormonal contraceptives may be reduced if co-administered with olaparib. 
Therefore, an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method should be considered during treatment (see 
section  4.5).  For  women  with  hormone  dependent  cancer,  two  non-hormonal  contraceptive  methods 
should be considered. 
Olaparib has clastogenic potential it is not known whether olaparib or its metabolites are found in seminal 
fluid.  Therefore,  male  patients  must  use  a  condom  during  therapy  and  for  3  months  after  receiving  the 
last  dose  of  Lynparza  when  having  sexual  intercourse  with  a  pregnant  woman  or  with  a  woman  of 
childbearing  potential.  Female  partners  of  male  patients  must  also  use  highly  effective  contraception  if 
they  are  of  childbearing  potential.  Male  patients  should  not  donate  sperm  during  therapy  and  for  3 
months after receiving the last dose of Lynparza (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Additional expert consultations 
See under discussion on clinical efficacy. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  olaparib  including  patients  from  OlympiAD  is  generally  consistent  with  the  known 
safety profile of olaparib. It includes gastrointestinal AEs, hematologic toxicity and general disorders. No 
new  safety  signals  were  identified  from  patients  with  gBRCAm  HER2-negative  metastatic  breast  cancer. 
AEs  associated  with  olaparib  are  generally  mild  or  moderate,  manageable  with  dose  modification  or 
standard supportive treatment and rarely requiring treatment discontinuation.  
Regarding MDS/AML, pneumonitis and new primary malignancies, a causal relationship between olaparib 
treatment  and  these  adverse  events  has  not  been  established.  Therefore,  they  are  still  considered  as 
important potential risk for olaparib with ongoing surveillance activities detailed in the RMP.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC of 
Lynparza tablets have been updated. Particularly, the warning with regard to women of childbearing 
potential/contraception in females has been modified to the product information. The SmPC of Lynparza 
capsule has been revised accordingly to reflect updated safety information. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the SmPC guideline and excipients guideline 
which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication is for Lynparza in monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA1/2-
mutations,  who  have  HER2-negative  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer.  Patients  should  have 
previously  been  treated  with  an  anthracycline  and  a  taxane  in  the  (neo)adjuvant  or  metastatic  setting  
unless  patients  were  not  suitable  for  these  treatments.  Patient  with  hormone  receptor  (HR)-positive 
breast  cancer  should  also  have  progressed  on  or  after  prior  endocrine  therapy,  or  be  considered 
unsuitable for endocrine therapy.  
Breast cancer is a life-threatening disease and is the second leading cause of cancer death among women 
and the fourth leading cause of cancer death overall (American Cancer Society 2018).  
Approximately 5% of breast cancers are associated with a germline mutation in the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 
gene  with  approximately  3%  associated  with  the  BRCA2  gene  (generally  hormone  receptor  positive).  In 
the general population, BRCA1/2 mutation carriers have an increased relative risk of breast cancer. The 
presence  of  gBRCA1  mutations  is  associated  with  a  lifetime  risk  of  breast  cancer  ranging  from  60%  to 
70%.  gBRCA2  mutations  are  associated  with  a  lifetime  risk  of  breast  cancer  between  40%  to  60%  in 
women and 5% to 10% in men. Rare individuals carry deleterious mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 
genes. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The  selection  of  appropriate  therapy  for  advanced  breast  cancer  comprising  locally  advanced  and 
metastatic breast cancer is complex because of the many treatment options and biologic heterogeneity of 
the disease (ABC4 consensus guidelines). The potential treatment options are determined in accordance 
with ER and PR and HER2 status of the tumour. Treatment options for patients presenting with metastatic 
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 117/124 
 
  
  
breast  cancer  may  also  be  influenced  by  what  adjuvant  therapy  was  used,  how  soon  after  adjuvant 
therapy the patient relapses, and by sites of metastasis.  
Currently,  single  agent  chemotherapy  after  previous  exposure  to  anthracyclines  and  taxanes  has  a 
median progression free survival (PFS) of approximately 4 months and an overall survival (OS) of 9 to 16 
months when given early in the metastatic setting. 
For  patients  with  HER2-negative  metastatic  breast  cancer,  there  is  no  one  preferred  first-line 
chemotherapy.  Sequential  monotherapy  with  single agents  such  as  capecitabine,  vinorelbine,  or  eribulin 
are  among  the  preferred  choices  in  metastatic  breast  cancer  patients  previously  treated  with  an 
anthracycline  and  a  taxane  in  the  adjuvant  or  metastatic  setting  and  for  whom  further  hormonal 
treatments  are  not  indicated  (NCCN  2018).  Combination  chemotherapy  is  reserved  for  select  patients 
with high tumour burden, rapid clinical progression, life-threatening visceral metastases, or need for rapid 
symptom and/or disease control. 
There  is  no  targeted therapy  available to  date  for  a treatment of  TNBC.  The  prognosis  for  patients  with 
TNBC  and/or  those  who  carry  gBRCA1  mutations  with  metastatic  disease  may  even  be  worse  than  the 
overall metastatic breast cancer population. According to current NCCN guidelines (2018), carboplatin is 
considered as one of recommended regimens for recurrent or metastatic disease.  
For  the  treatment  of  hormone  receptor  (HR)-positive,  HER2-negative  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
breast  cancer,  CDK4/6 inhibitors  have  recently  been  approved  in  combination  with  endocrine therapy  in 
first line and in women who have received prior endocrine therapy. Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, is also 
approved  for  the  treatment  of  hormone  receptor-positive,  HER2  negative  advanced  breast  cancer,  in 
combination  with  exemestane,  in  postmenopausal  women  without  symptomatic  visceral  disease  after 
recurrence or progression following a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor.  
There are currently no treatments approved in the European Union (EU) specifically for gBRCAm patients 
with  metastatic  breast  cancer  and  these  patients  are  treated  depending  on  the  hormone  receptor  and 
HER2 status determined in their tumours. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is based on results from the pivotal Phase III, randomised, controlled, open-label, 
multicentre study D0819C00003 (OlympiAD) (n=302), in which gBRCAm patients who had previously 
received chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting (no more than 2 prior lines of 
chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer) and were HER2-negative were randomised 2:1 to receive 
either olaparib (300 mg bd, tablet formulation) or physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, 
eribulin, or vinorelbine). Patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer should have been treated 
with a prior endocrine therapy or should be patients for whom endocrine therapy is not an appropriate 
option.  
Patients with somatic BRCA1/2-mutated tumours were not eligible and have not been included. 
The primary endpoint was PFS as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR). OS, PFS2 
(investigator assessment) and ORR (by BICR) were secondary endpoints. TFST and TSST were also 
analysed as supportive endpoints for PFS and PFS2, respectively. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
OlympiAD met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically relevant 3-
months improvement in PFS based on BICR in the FAS population treated with olaparib compared to 
physician’s choice of chemotherapy (HR 0.58; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.80; p<0.0001; median 7.03 vs 4.17 
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 118/124 
 
  
  
months) which was supported by investigator assessment (HR 0.50; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.68; p=0.0009; 
median 7.8 vs 3.8 months).  
Following the subgroup analyses of PFS, no subgroups appeared to derive a differential benefit compared 
with the overall population. The treatment effects observed in individual chemotherapies (capecitabin, 
vinorelbin or eribulin) were similar to that observed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) set. 
A statistical significant improvement on PFS2 was observed in the olaparib arm (HR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 – 
0.87; p=0.0033) with a median second PFS 13.17 months in the olaparib arm compared to 9.26 months 
in the comparator arm. Final post-hoc PFS2 analysis was consistent with PFS2 at the DCO for primary 
analysis.  
Final OS analysis was conducted at 64% maturity of the FAS population. There was no suggestion of a 
detrimental effect on OS, with the HR numerically favouring olaparib [HR 0.90 (95% Cl: 0.66, 1.23; 
p=0.5131; median OS 19.3 months in the olaparib arm versus 17.1 months in the physician’s choice of 
chemotherapy arm].  
Confirmed ORR (CR or PR) in patients with measurable disease was 52 % (87/167) in the olaparib arm 
and 23% (15/66) in the chemotherapy arm. A complete response was observed in 13 patients (8%) in 
the olaparib arm and 1 patient (1.5%) in the comparator arm.  
The median DoR was 6.9 months (95%CI 4.2, 10.2) in the olaparib arm and 7.9 months (95%CI 4.5, 
12.2) in the chemotherapy arm.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Due to the lack of a direct comparison with platinum chemotherapy, the relative efficacy of olaparib with 
such  treatment  has  not  been  defined.  Furthermore,  the  efficacy  of  olaparib  has  not  been  evaluated  in 
patients  defined  as  resistant  to prior  platinum  therapy.  Patients  who  had  received  platinum  (cisplatin  or 
carboplatin, either as monotherapy or in combination) for advanced breast cancer were eligible to enter 
the study provided there had been no evidence of disease progression during the platinum chemotherapy 
in  metastatic  setting  or  as  (neo)adjuvant  treatment  at  least  12  months  before  the  randomisation.  Thus 
there  is  a  general  uncertainty  about  the  optimal  sequence  of  treatment  with  olaparib  in  a  treatment 
context  where  platinum  based  chemotherapy  is  an  option.  Information  about  prior  and  subsequent 
platinum therapy received is considered relevant for the prescribers and has been included in the section 
5.1 SmPC.  
Resistance  mechanisms  to  DNA-damaging  agents  including  PARP  inhibitors  has  not  been  sufficiently 
investigated to date and would be of value to determine the optimal sequence of use for PARP inhibitors 
and  chemotherapy  for  breast  cancer  and  to  elaborate  more  effective  therapeutic  strategies  in  advanced 
BRCAm  breast  cancer.  The  investigation  of  efficacy  in  platinum-resistant  tumours  and  comparative 
efficacy to platinum agents is recommended 
3.1.  Unfavourable effects 
The  most  common  ADRs  in  the  olaparib  arm  were:  nausea  (58.0%),  anaemia  (39.5%),  vomiting 
(32.2%), fatigue (29.8%), diarrhoea (20.5%), headache (20.5%), neutropenia (18.0%), cough (17.1%), 
decreased  appetite  (17.1%),  WBC  decreased  (16.1%),  neutrophil  count  decreased  (11.2%)  and 
leukopenia  (11.2%).  These  were  generally  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  did  not  lead  to 
discontinuation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/208498/2019 
Page 119/124 
 
  
  
Gastrointestinal  toxicity  (nausea,  vomiting  and  diarrhoea),  hematologic  toxicity  (anaemia),  fatigue, 
headache  are  considered  the  main  risks  with  olaparib.  Nausea  and  vomiting  were  reported  at  a 
significantly higher frequency in olaparib arm than in the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm.  
The toxicity of olaparib was manageable by dose interruptions, dose reductions and standard supportive 
treatment  as  required.  Discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  occurred  for  4.9%  of  the  patients  in 
olaparib  arm  and  7.7%  of  the  patients  in  the  physician’s  choice  of  chemotherapy  arm.  In  olaparib  arm 
and  in  the  physician’s  choice  of  chemotherapy  arm,  anaemia  was  the  most  common  AE  leading  to 
discontinuation (2.0% and 2.2% respectively). 
AEs of anaemia were reported for a higher proportion of patients in the olaparib arm (40.0%) compared 
with the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm (26.4%). These events were predominantly Grade 1 or 
2  in  severity  and  approximately  half  of  the  patients  in  the  olaparib  arm  and  one  third  in  the 
chemotherapy  arm  have  been  treated  for  this  AE.  CTCAE  Grade  ≥   3  anaemia  was  reported  in  16.1% 
patients  in  olaparib  arm  vs.  4.4%  patients  in  the  physician’s  choice  of  chemotherapy  arm.  In  total, 
18.0%  patients  in  the  olaparib  arm,  and  5.5%  patients  in  the  physician’s  choice  of  chemotherapy  arm 
had blood transfusions.  
Grade ≥3 AEs had a higher incidence in the physician’s choice of chemotherapy arm (49.5% of patients) 
than in the olaparib arm (38.0%).  
There were no reports of MDS/AML or pneumonitis in the study.  A new primary malignancy was reported 
for  1  patient  (0.5%)  in  the  olaparib  arm.  This  was  a  non-serious,  CTCAE  grade  1  event  of  malignant 
melanoma in situ.  The patient also had a medical history of melanoma. 
Most  deaths  occurring on study  were  related to the disease  under  investigation  with  only one  patient  in 
the  olaparib  arm  with  an  AE  leading  to  death  (sepsis)  which  was  not  considered  related  to  study 
treatment by the investigator. 
The  safety  profile  of  olaparib  in  patients  with  gBRCA  mutations  in  the  OlympiAD  trial  was  generally 
consistent with the known safety profile of olaparib.  
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Available  long-term  safety  data  are  still  limited.  Long-term  exposure  to/potential  toxicity  to  olaparib 
remains  classified  as  missing  information  in  the  risk  management  plan  supported  by  pharmacovigilance 
activities. MDS/AML and NPM will also continue to be closely monitored as reflected in the RMP. 
There was no report of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/AML. The causality of olaparib in occurrence of 
these events has not been established. Long-term exposure to/potential toxicity to olaparib are currently 
classified  in  the  risk  management  plan  as  important  potential  risks  addressed  by  pharmacovigilance 
activities.  MDS/AML  and  the  risk  of  new  primary  malignancies  will  continue  to  be  closely  monitored  as 
reflected in the RMP.

3.4.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  benefits  of  olaparib  in  germline  BRCA  mutated  metastatic  breast  cancer  are  supported  by  a 
statistically  significant  improvement  in  PFS  supported  by  consistent  results  in  PFS2  and  ORR  compared 
with  chemotherapy.  There  was  no  suggestion  of  a  detrimental  effect  on  OS  with  the  HR  numerically 
favouring  olaparib.  Results  appear  robust  and  consistent  in  the  different  sensitivity  and  subgroup 
analyses  provided.  The  magnitude  of  the  improvement  in  the  ITT  population  (3-months  for  median  PFS 
translating into a 67% relative prolongation of median PFS) is of potential clinical relevance in both HER2 
negative/ER and/or PgR positive breast cancer and TNBC.  
The  safety  profile  of  olaparib  including  patients  from  OlympiAD  is  generally  consistent  with  the  known 
safety  profile  of  olaparib.  No  new  safety  signals  were  identified  from  patients  with  gBRCAm  HER2-
negative  metastatic  breast  cancer  and  safety  findings  in  olaparib  arm of  OlympiAD  were  consistent  with 
the 300 mg tablet pool. The toxicity of olaparib was manageable with dose interruptions, dose reductions 
and standard supportive treatment as required. However, it should be highlight that nausea and vomiting 
were  reported  at  a  significantly  higher  frequency  in  olaparib  arm  than  in  the  physician’s  choice  of 
chemotherapy arm. Among haematological toxicities, anaemia is the most prominent. It was reported at 
higher  frequency  in  the  olaparib  arm,  lead  to  discontinuation  in  some  patients  and  resulted  in  blood 
transfusions in 18% of patients in the olaparib arm. 
3.4.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In view of the poor prognosis of the germinal BRCAm HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in patients 
previously treated with an anthracycline and a taxane in the adjuvant /neoadjuvant or metastatic setting 
and  for  whom  hormonal  treatments  are  not  indicated,  the  results  of  the  pivotal  OlympiAD  trial  are 
considered  of  clinical  relevance.  The  observed  3  months  gain  in  median  PFS,  supported  by  consistent 
improvement  in  PFS2  and  no  detriment  to  OS  compared  with  chemotherapy,  is  considered  of  clinical 
benefit  and  able  to  outweigh  the  treatment  related  toxicity  which  compares  favourably  with 
chemotherapy-related toxicity.

3.4.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Patients with locally advanced disease with a generally better prognosis have not been included in the 
pivotal trial, but the extrapolation to this patient population was considered acceptable by the CHMP given 
a similar clinical management for locally advanced and metastatic disease and based on a biological and 
pharmacological rationale. 
There are no clinical data available on the responsiveness of breast tumours with somatic BRCA mutation 
to PARPi. The MAH is recommended to collect clinical data in this population. In line with the SAG 
Oncology advice, extrapolation of results from patients with germline BRCA mutations that developed 
breast cancer to patients with sporadic breast cancers that harbour somatic BRCA mutations in their 
tumours is not justified for the time being in the absence of any clinical data and other data supporting 
the proposed mechanistic rationale. Although the mechanistic theoretical rationale is acknowledged, the 
magnitude of the potential effect in the context of breast cancer is uncertain. The indication has therefore 
been restricted to gBRCAm patients only until clinical outcome data for sBRCAm patients become 
available.  
Substantial  clinical  benefit  including  OS  benefit  has  been  shown  for  anthracyclines  and  taxanes  that  are 
current  standard  of  care.  As  per  eligibly  criteria,  nearly  all  patients  enrolled  in  the  study  had  prior 
anthracycline  and  taxane  therapy.  It  is  therefore  considered  that  anthracycline  and  taxane  should  be 
specified  prior  regimens  in  the  indication  unless  patients  were  not  suitable  for  these  treatments.  In  line 
with  the  studied  population,  the  indication  also  reflects  that  HR+  breast  cancer  patients  should  have 
progressed on a prior endocrine therapy or be considered unsuitable for endocrine therapy.  
gBRCA mutations are found in 10% of male breast cancer patients with the majority with mutations in 
BRCA2. Despite the limited number of male patients included in the OlympiAD study (n=7), the CHMP 
considers that the extrapolation to a very rare population of male breast cancer patients with germline 
BRCA mutations, predominantly BRCA2 and characterised by high grade and aggressive phenotype 
(Silvestri et al, 2016) is acceptable based on the common biological and pharmacological rationale. 
3.5.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lynparza is positive for the following indication: Lynparza in monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA1/2-mutations, who have HER2-negative locally advanced 
or metastatic breast cancer. Patients should have previously been treated with an anthracycline and a 
taxane in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments. 
Patient with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer should also have progressed on or after prior 
endocrine therapy, or be considered unsuitable for endocrine therapy. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Extension of indication to include the use of Lynparza tablets as monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with germline BRCA1/2-mutations, who have HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer; patients should have previously been treated with an anthracycline and a taxane in the 
(neo)adjuvant or metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments. Patient with 
hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer should also have progressed on or after prior endocrine 
therapy, or be considered unsuitable for endocrine therapy. As a consequence of this new indication, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC of Lynparza tablets have been updated. The 
SmPC of Lynparza capsule has been revised to reflect updated safety information and the Package Leaflet 
has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, RMP version 16.3 has also been accepted. Changes were 
also made to the PI to bring it in line with the SmPC guideline and excipients guideline which were 
reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

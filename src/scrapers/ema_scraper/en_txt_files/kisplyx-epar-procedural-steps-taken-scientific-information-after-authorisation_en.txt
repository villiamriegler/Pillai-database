cell carcinoma treated with Kisplyx in combination 
with pembrolizumab, based on the final analysis for 
the overall population and by risk prognosis 
subgroups from study E7080-G000-307/CLEAR; this 
is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 
study comparing the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib 
in combination with either pembrolizumab or 
everolimus versus sunitinib alone in first-line 
treatment of subjects with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC). This application was submitted to 
fulfil the EMA Recommendation (REC) following the 
assessment of procedure II/0045. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
The median PFS for lenvatinib in combination with 
pembrolizumab was 23.9 months (95% CI: 20.8, 27.7) 
compared with 9.2 months (95% CI: 6.0, 11.0) for 
sunitinib, with HR 0.47 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.57; P value 
<0.0001). For OS, HR was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.99; P 
value 0.0424). The ORR for lenvatinib in combination with 
pembrolizumab was 71.3% (95% CI: 66.6, 76.0) vs 36.7% 
(95% CI: 31.7, 41.7) P value <0.0001 for sunitinib. 
The final OS analysis was not adjusted to account for 
subsequent therapies, with 195/357 (54.6%) patients in 
the sunitinib arm and 56/355 (15.8%) patients in the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm receiving subsequent 
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.

paclitaxel has no significant impact on the 
pharmacokinetics of any of these 3 substances. 
Additionally, in patients with RCC the pharmacokinetics of 
lenvatinib was not significantly affected by concomitant 
everolimus. 
A clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in cancer 
patients showed that plasma concentrations of midazolam 
(a sensitive CYP3A and Pgp substrate) were not altered in 
the presence of lenvatinib. Additionally, in patients with 
RCC the pharmacokinetics of everolimus was not 
significantly affected by concomitant lenvatinib. No 
significant drug-drug interaction is therefore expected 
between lenvatinib and other CYP3A4/Pgp substrates.

In addition, pneumothorax has been reported with and

with tumour regression or necrosis. Prior surgery and 
radiotherapy may be contributing risk factors. Lung 
metastases may also increase the risk of pneumothorax.

A clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in cancer

Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC to include that 
there is no significant drug-drug interaction risk with 
midazolam, based on the results of study E7080-
A001-109 (A Phase 1 Study to determine DDI of 
lenvatinib and midazolam, a cytochrome P450 3A4

patients showed that plasma concentrations of midazolam 
(a sensitive CYP3A and Pgp substrate) were not altered in 
the presence of lenvatinib.  No significant drug-drug 
interaction is therefore expected between lenvatinib and 
other CYP3A4/Pgp substrates.

of lenvatinib.  
No formal studies of the effect of lenvatinib on wound 
healing have been conducted.  Impaired wound healing has 
been reported in patients receiving lenvatinib.  Temporary 
interruption of lenvatinib should be considered in patients 
undergoing major surgical procedures.  There is limited 
clinical experience regarding the timing of reinitiation of 
lenvatinib following a major surgical procedure.  Therefore, 
the decision to resume lenvatinib following a major surgical 
procedure should be based on clinical judgment of 
adequate wound healing.

adverse events “cholecystitis” with frequency 
common, and the adverse events “pancreatitis”, 
“amylase Increased” and “lipase increased” with 
frequencies uncommon, common and common, 
respectively. The Package Leaflet is updated

products and to combine the Kisplyx SmPC. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

All subjects were managed using dose interruption as 
recommended in the protocol and there were no dose 
reductions or treatment discontinuations as a result of 
events of cholecystitis. During the clinical trials the overall 
frequency of cholecystitis including cholecystitis with 
gallstones was “common”, i.e., it occurred in between 
1/100 and 1/10 of the patients. The table 4 of the section 
4.8 of the SmPC is updated accordingly. 
Serious pancreatitis and pancreatitis related events (lipase 
increased and amylase increased) were observed in clinical 
trials and in post marketing experience in association with 
lenvatinib dosage, the majority being associated with the 
24 mg daily dose. All subjects were managed using dose 
interruption, dose reduction and discontinuations (0.3% of 
all subjects) as recommended in the protocol. During the 
clinical trials pancreatitis occurred at a frequency of 0.9% 
and high grade pancreatitis at a frequency of 0.7%.  Lipase 
Page 19/21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and amylase elevations were reported at frequencies of 
3.8% and 2% respectively with high grade frequencies of 
2.1% and 1.1% respectively. Amylase and lipase elevations 
are frequently reported with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors and 
may result from a class effect. The table 4 of section 4.8 of 
the SmPC is updated accordingly. No case of death has 
been linked to lenvatinib regimen.

reported in post marketing experience. In post marketing 
surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery haemorrhages 
were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic 
thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than in DTC or other tumour 
types. The degree of tumour invasion/infiltration of major 
blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery) should be considered 
because of the potential risk of severe haemorrhage 
associated with tumour shrinkage/necrosis following 
lenvatinib therapy. Some cases of bleeding have occurred 
secondarily to tumour shrinkage and fistula formation, e.g. 
tracheo-oesophageal fistulae. Cases of fatal intracranial 
haemorrhage have been reported in some patients with or 
without brain metastases. Bleeding in sites other than the 
brain (e.g. trachea, intra-abdominal, lung) has also been 
reported. In the case of bleeding, dose interruptions, 
adjustments, or discontinuation may be required (for more 
information, please refer to the SmPC).  
Patients may be at increased risk for the development of 
fistulae when treated with lenvatinib. Cases of fistula

formation or enlargement that involve other areas of the 
body than stomach or intestines were observed in clinical 
trials and in post-marketing experience (e.g. tracheal, 
tracheo-oesophageal, oesophageal, cutaneous, female 
genital tract fistulae). Prior surgery and radiotherapy may 
be contributing risk factors. Lenvatinib should not be 
started in patients with fistula to avoid worsening and 
lenvatinib should be permanently discontinued in patients 
with oesophageal or tracheobronchial tract involvement and 
any Grade 4 fistula, limited information is available on the 
use of dose interruption or reduction in management of 
other events, but worsening was observed in some cases 
and caution should be taken. Lenvatinib may adversely 
affect the wound healing process as other agents of the 
same class.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) are the most common forms of Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
(CTCL) a rare, heterogeneous group of mature T-cell lymphomas with primary cutaneous involvement. The 
current definition of CTCLs follows the 2016 revision of the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification of 
tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues.  
In lymphoma classifications, CTCL is considered a subtype of the primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCLs), defined 
as non-Hodgkin lymphoma that presents in the skin with no evidence of extra-cutaneous disease at diagnosis. 
The term CTCL does not refer to a single disease entity, but to a group of diseases with different clinical 
behaviour, therapeutic requirements, and prognosis. For many years mycosis fungoides and Sézary's syndrome 
(SS) were the only known types of CTCL. In the last decade, based on a combination of clinical, histological, and 
immunophenotypical criteria, new types of CTCL have been defined and new classifications for this group of 
primary cutaneous lymphomas have been formulated.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
PCLs are the second most common group of extranodal non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas with an estimated annual 
incidence of 1/100,000 in Western countries. CTCL constitutes ~75-80% of all PCLs in the western world, with 
mycosis fungoides (MF) as the most common type of CTCL (50-60%). The peak age of classic MF is between 55 
and 60 years with an increased frequency in males compared to females (M/F ratio 2.2:1) and the incidence is 
between 1/350.000 and 1/110.000 (Orphanet). SS is the second most common CTCL type, accounting for 3-5% 
of all CTCL cases (Swerdlow et al, 2016.)  
A group of primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) account for around 15% of CTCLs. 
This group mainly constitutes of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) and lymphomatoid 
papulosis (LyP). Other more rare CTCL subtypes (exact incidence unknown) are a.o. primary cutaneaous 
gamma-delta T cell lymphoma (<1% of PCLs), subcutaneous pannuculitis-like-T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL), and 
extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (Swerdlow et al, 2016, NCCN Guidelines Insights: T-Cell Lymphomas, Version 
2.2018)  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
MF and SS arise from mature T-cells (Campbell et al, 2010), and the clonal nature of neoplastic lymphocytes can 
be demonstrated by the PCR characterisation of the T-cell receptor. Phenotype abnormalities (such e.g. lack of 
CD7 and CD26 expression) that can vary across different CTCL subtypes and disease stages are frequently 
observed on neoplastic T-cells.  
Cytogenetic analyses have demonstrated that chromosomal abnormalities are frequent in advanced stage 
MF/SS, and molecular patterns related to P53, LYRT-10 (a member of the NF-kB family), BCL2 and STST3 are 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 9/115 
  
  
frequently involved in disease pathogenesis. In this regard, the BCL2 and MYB oncogenes expression is 
up-regulated by exposure to IL-7 and IL-15, that act as growth factors in MF/SS.  
Certain chemokine receptors are upregulated in CTCL that might play a critical role in the migration dynamics of 
malignant lymphocytes to the skin. The chemokine receptor CCR4 has been associated with skin-homing of T 
cells. CCR4 is overexpressed on the surface of and/or expressed by a high percentage of the cancerous cells in 
T-cell malignancies such as CTCL. In particular, MF and SS are known to frequently display a Th2-like 
phenotype, with an increased expression of CCR4 (Scarisbrick et al, 2018). However, the prevalence of patients 
with CCR4 positive malignant lymphocytes and the percentage of CCR4 positive cells and/or the level of CCR4 
expression seems to vary between the different CTCL subtypes. The extent of CCR4 expression in rarer forms of 
CTCL is poorly characterised. The aetiology of CTCLs remains unknown. No genetic predisposition has been 
demonstrated. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The clinical manifestation of CTCLs is manifold and is characterised by three classic cutaneous phases: patch, 
plaque and tumour. Blood, lymph nodes and viscera are usually involved in later stages. The clinical course and 
prognosis of CTCLs depend on disease type and stage. In the majority of patients with MF, the disease has an 
initial indolent course. Disease progression is usually sequential, from limited skin involvement in the form of 
one or more patches, to plaques, tumours and nodal/visceral involvement (Olsen et al, 2007).  
The hallmark of SS is the diagnostic triad of intensely pruritic erythroderma, lymphadenopathy and abnormal 
T-cells in peripheral blood. In most advanced forms, patients suffer from alopecia, ectropion, leonine facies, 
hyperkeratosis, nail dystrophy, fissuring of the palms and soles, severe pruritus and pain (Kim et al, 2003). 
Early stages MF patients have, in the absence of rapid progression, an almost normal life expectancy. On the 
other hand, advanced stage MF (i.e. subjects with significant nodal/visceral involvement and/or extensive skin 
involvement) and SS are characterized by a relatively short median life expectancy (e.g. 30 to 55 months). 
Prognostic data on rarer CTCL subtypes are sparse, yet some forms, such as the primary cutaneous 
gamma-delta T cell lymphoma, are known to be aggressive malignancies with survival rates between 11% and 
20% at 5 years. Other forms (e.g. the CD30+ primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma) have a more 
benign prognosis. The type of skin involvement, as well as the presence of extracutaneous disease, are 
significant prognostic factors in this patient population. Accordingly, CTCL is staged using the four anatomical 
compartments potentially affected by disease (i.e., skin, lymph nodes, viscera, and blood), as each of the 
compartments has prognostic significance. Survival is related to stage of disease as well as disease type. The 
presence of disease in blood (leukaemia) and/or lymph nodes/viscera (lymphoma) is also correlated with a 
worse overall survival in patientsin MF, SS (NCCN Guidelines Insights: T-Cell Lymphomas, Version 2.2018). 
MF is a disease with a persistent and relapsing course and prognosis is stage dependent. Classic MF is an 
epidermotropic CTCL clinically characterized by the progression from patch stage to plaques stage and in the 
end to tumour stage. MF stage IA or IB has excellent prognosis, however progression to advanced stages occurs 
in around 25% of the patients. MF Stage IIB and III has a median survival of 4-6 years and stage IV has a poor 
prognosis with a median survival of less than 4 years.  
SS is a rare, aggressive, leukaemic form of CTCL that is distinguished from MF primarily by the presence of high 
levels of circulating atypical T cells (Sézary cells), extensive skin erythema and severe pruritus. While SS is 
generally considered separate from MF, progression from MF to SS is occasionally observed. Both MF and SS are 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 10/115 
  
  
defined histologically and staged by the same criteria. In contrast to patch/plaque MF, SS is much more 
symptomatic, has a lower potential for remission, and lower expected survival.  
The prognosis for LPD is good with a ten year survival of 90% for pcALCL and 100% for Lyp. Up to 40% of the 
pcALCL localized lesions show some spontaneous regression. Most patients with pcALCL will attain a CR 
following initial therapy, however, recurrences occur often (>40%) and patients can experience serial relapses. 
Extra-cutaneous spread occurs in up to 13% at time of relapse. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The early stages of MF can be managed with skin direct therapies (e.g. topical steroids, PUVA, UVB, topical 
cytostatic agents, local EBT). In advanced stages (IIB-IV) recommended options include, in combination or 
alone: total skin EBT (CR44-74%), PUVA (CR 30-70%), interferon (RR30-60%) and retinoids (RR45-55%) 
including second line option bexarotene (RR30-50%). Many clinicians administer oral methotrexate in refractory 
(RR ±35%) or in advanced stage disease (RR30-50%), however methotrexate is currently not recommended for 
MF by the ESMO. In advanced refractory disease gemcitabine or liposomal doxorubicin (RR 40-80%) could be 
considered. Multi-agent chemotherapy is only indicated in patients with extensive disease (stage IV). 
With SS, being a systemic disease by definition (i.e. leukaemia), systemic treatment is required. Skin-directed 
therapies like PUVA or potent topical steroids may be used as adjuvant therapy. Extracorporeal photopheresis 
(ECP), either alone or in combination with other treatment modalities such as interferon alpha retinoids, total 
skin electron beam and PUVA, has been suggested as treatment of choice in SS and erythrodermic MF. Low dose 
methotrexate, bexarotene, denileukin difitox, alemtuzumab (low-dose) and multiagent chemotherapy have 
been recommended as second-line treatment of SS. Comparison of treatment results between the different 
studies is extremely difficult due to differences in diagnostic criteria used for SS (Olsen et al, 2007). 
Due to the heterogeneity and rarity of PCL, controlled trials are rare, there is no standard initial therapy, and 
treatment options are diverse. Systemic agents approved in the EU are interferon, which is approved in only 
some EU countries, and bexarotene; in the US methotrexate, bexarotene, vorinostat, and romidepsin are 
approved as systemic treatment of CTCL: 
Although a broad spectrum of therapy regimens has been reported, these have been limited to small cohort 
series or case reports. PcALCL patients with isolated lesions should receive surgical excision or radiation, which 
can be again used in case of recurrence. With multiple recurrences and/or multiple lesions, systemic therapy is 
recommended due to the morbidity of repeated surgery/radiation. First choice is oral methotrexate (RR 87%). 
Patients often have recurrence after discontinuation. In case of progression bexarotene (RR ±50% in CTCL 
patients) and interferon (RR 60% in CTCL patients) are options. In case of wide spread nodal or visceral 
involvement or refractory disease gemcitabine and etoposide are options. Multi-agent chemotherapy is only 
indicated in patients presenting with extra-cutaneous disease or rapidly progressive skin disease (rare). 
Unmet medical need 
Few systemic agents are approved for MF, SS and CTCL in general, the condition often becomes treatment 
resistant. At present, there are no standard therapies for patients with higher stage treatment resistant disease. 
Therefore, a substantial medical need exists to develop new therapies for CTCL that can target all disease 
compartments (skin, blood, lymph nodes, and viscera) and provide a durable response in the treatment of this 
orphan disease.

About the product 
POTELIGEO (mogamulizumab), is a defucosylated humanised IgG1 kappa antibody, that selectively binds to C-C 
chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4), a molecular receptor on lymphocytes that binds CC chemokines involved in 
lymphocyte trafficking to various organs including the skin. Non-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate 
mogamulizumab binding targets a cell and initiates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) resulting in 
depletion of the target cells. In healthy individuals, CCR4 is known to be selectively expressed on a subset of T 
cells, including Type 2 T helper (Th2) T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). CCR4 is overexpressed on the surface 
or expressed by a high percentage of the cancerous cells in T-cell malignancies such as cutaneous T-cell 
lymphoma (CTCL) and adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma (ATL). As a defucosylated antibody, mogamulizumab 
intends to induce enhanced ADCC activity against CCR4-expressing target cells compared with conventionally 
fucosylated antibodies.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Mogamulizumab is a defucosylated humanised IgG1 kappa antibody that selectively binds to C-C chemokine 
receptor type 4 (CCR4).  
Mogamulizumab is a glycoprotein (molecular weight: approximately 149,000) composed of two heavy chain 
(γ1-chain) molecules and two low chain (κ-chain) molecules. Mogamulizumab has secondary and tertiary 
structures that contain considerable β-sheet structure and aromatic amino acids that are located in 
asymmetrical, well-defined environments.

Mogamulizumab was produced using technology developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK), which 
established a cell clone producing a defucosylated mAb. Due to the absence of fucose from the complex type 
oligosaccharide at the constant (Fc) region, mogamulizumab has enhanced antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, but does not exhibit any complement dependent cytotoxic (CDC) activity or 
neutralizing activity of the ligand of CCR4. 
Mogamulizumab has Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) derived from mouse anti-human 
CC-chemokine Receptor 4 (CCR4), which binds to CCR4 antigens on the surface of T-cells and induces 
Antibody-dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). The mechanism of action (MoA) of mogamulizumab is ADCC 
that is established via interactions between the CCR4 antigen on the target cells, the antibody, and the Fc 
gamma Receptor IIIa (FcγRIIIa) on the natural killer (NK) effector cells. The mode of action (MoA) is illustrated 
below.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Figure 1:  Mogamulizumab MoA 
The mogamulizumab active substance is manufactured at Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (Takasaki Plant) in Japan.  
The scale of the active substance manufacturing process is defined by the size of the production bioreactor. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The mogamulizmuab active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. Main steps are 
cell culture expansion starting from a working cell bank (WCB) vial, fed-batch mode production of 
mogamulizumab, harvesting, purification and filtration. The ranges of critical process parameters and the 
routine in-process controls along with acceptance criteria, including controls for microbial purity and endotoxin, 
are described for each step. The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable.

Mogamulizumab active substance can be stored for 36 months at -70 °C. No reprocessed material will be 
released for use without appropriate regulatory notification and approval, as required. 
Validated pool hold times at defined temperatures have been established for in-process pools in the harvest and 
purification processes through validation of the commercial manufacturing process. 
Control of materials 
Specifications of compendial and non-compendial materials used during active substance manufacture are 
provided. No raw materials derived from animal origin are used during active substance manufacture. 
A murine hybridoma monoclonal antibody KM2160 produced by the fusion of the immunized mice spleen cells 
and mouse myeloma cells was selected based on its specific binding activity to the CCR4-expressing human 
cancer cells. The humanized anti-CCR4 antibody, constructed by combining the Complementarity-Determining 
Regions of KM2160 with human framework regions and human IgG1κ constant regions, showed ADCC activity 
against the CCR4-expressing human cutaneous T-cell lymphoma HH cells. The expression plasmid for the 
mogamulizumab production was constructed using a humanized IgG1 expression plasmid by joining the 
humanized anti-CCR4 mogamulizumab VH and VL chain cDNAs with human γ1 and κ constant region cDNAs.  
Mogamulizumab production cell line was constructed by introducing the mogamulizumab expression plasmid to 
the host cell line (CHO), selecting transformants, and amplifying the gene copy number by stepwise increase of 
methotrexate (MTX) concentration. To ensure the clonality and specific productivity of the cells, a single-cell 
cloning was performed twice, and the clone was selected to prepare a master cell bank (MCB).  
The MCB was generated in GMP-like conditions. The vials are maintained in controlled liquid nitrogen freezers in 
limited access facilities in multiple geographic locations. The WCB lot was generated in accordance with GMP. 
The growth medium contained no animal derived materials.The vials are maintained in controlled liquid nitrogen 
freezers limited access facilities in multiple geographic locations. 
Testing and characterization of MCB lot and WCB lot were performed according to the ICH Q5D guideline Quality 
of Biotechnological Products: Derivation and Characterization of Cell Substrates Used for Production of 
Biotechnological/Biological Products. Sterility, mycoplasma testing, isoenzyme analysis, and viral testing were 
performed. The MCB and WCB are sterile and free of detectable mycoplasma and viruses, with the exception in 
the MCB of A-type retrovirus-like particles, which are routinely found in Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell lines.  
Any new WCB will be created from a MCB vial following established manufacturing procedures as described and 
will be qualified to ensure comparability to the existing WCB with respect to safety, genetic stability, cell viability 
after thaw, cell growth, protein production and product quality. 
The MCB, WCB, and LIVCA samples have been shown to be genetically stable. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Process performance is continuously verified by in-process-control (IPC) testing with rejection and/or action 
limit and in-process-monitoring (IPM) for process monitoring and trending purpose with internal alert limits. 
IPCs/IPMs were set taking into consideration the process consistency and controllability of the step as 
demonstrated by the process development and the process performance qualification (PPQ). A number of 
identified steps in the manufacturing process are considered as the critical quality attributes (CQA) of 
mogamulizumab and are controlled through IPC and action limits; the CQAs include non glycosylated species 
and non concensus glysosilated species, fucosylated species, mycoplasma and viruses, aggregates, host cell 
protein (HCP), host cell DNA (HCDNA), protein A, bioburden and endotoxins.

There are no critical intermediates in the mogamulizumab active substance manufacturing process. 
Process validation 
Process performance qualification has been performed at the commercial facility.  Several active substance lots 
were manufactured and complied with the proposed specification. Minor deviations occurred during the PPQ but 
satisfactory root cause analysis has been provided. The PPQ data provided show that the active substance 
manufacturing process has been successfully validated. Holding times of the pools have been established. The 
applicant has described chromatography column cleaning and re-use in an adequate manner. Media hold study 
results, buffer hold study results and uniformity of the filled bulk study results have all been provided. The active 
substance is shipped from the active substance site to the finished product site. Shiping validation has been 
performed.  
Mogamulizumab active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. Consistency in 
production has been shown on full scale commercial batches. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational 
parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the 
purification process consistently produces mogamulizumab active substance of reproducible quality that 
complies with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria.  
Manufacturing process development 
Critical quality attributes, critical performance attributes (CPA) and critical process parameters (CPP) have been 
defined based on risk analysis. An integrated control strategy is discussed. Process characterisation studies were 
performed to evaluate the robustness of the active substance manufacturing process, these included single 
parameter examinations and/or designs of experiments (DoE). Suitable scaled-down models were used for 
these experiments. Justification for parameters which were not studied (due to the applicant’s decision of 
non-criticality) has been provided. 
The applicant has used two processes for the active substance batches, process 1 for several clinical and 
toxicological studies and process 2 for most clinical, toxicological, PPQ and stability studies. Process 2 will be 
used for the commercial process. Comparability data has been provided for active substance batches of process 
1 and 2, showing comparable release analysis data.  
Characterisation 
Primary Structure 
The primary structure of mogamulizumab was determined. The entire amino acid sequence (including 
N-terminal sequence and C-terminal amino acid), the disulfide linkage arrangement, and the location of the 
N-glycosylation site were defined. 
Mogamulizumab contains eleven cysteine residues in each heavy chain and five cysteine residues in each light 
chain, which form twelve intramolecular disulphide bonds and four intermolecular disulphide bonds. There were 
no detectable disulfide mismatches (cross-bonds) or incomplete disulfide formation observed. 
The amino acid at position 299, was identified as Asp residue on deglycosylated peptide (LD1), demonstrating 
that the N-glycosylation site is Asn299 on each heavy chain. 
The main peaks in N-linked oligosaccharide profiling studies are identified as G2F0, G1F0, and G0F0 that 
correspond to the isoforms of asialo-, biantennary, and non-fucosylated complex type structures containing 2, 
1, and 0 galactose residues, respectively.

Physicochemical characteristics 
The molecular weight of mogamulizumab was determined using electrospray ionization time of flight mass 
spectrometry (ESI-TOF/MS).  
Mogamulizumab showed β-sheet structure and regularly secondary and tertiary structures of antibodies. The 
aromatic amino acids were located in asymmetrical, well-defined environments. 
There were two thermal transitions observed for mogamulizumab, derived from unfolding of the Fab domain and 
unfolding of the Fc CH3 domain. 
Biological Characterisation 
The biological properties of mogamulizumab were evaluated using binding and cell-based assays for various 
aspects, including: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the specificity for antigen binding of mogamulizumab against CCR4 was evaluated using flow cytometry; 
the binding affinity between mogamulizumab and CCR4 was also evaluated using an antigen-binding 
ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Mogamulizumab had high binding affinity to CCR4; 
the interaction between mogamulizumab and FcγRIIIa was evaluated using FcγRIIIa-binding ELISA and 
SPR. 
the interaction between the Fc domain and each FcγR (FcγRI, FcγRIIa, and FcγRIIb) were evaluated 
using a SPR 
-  ADCC activity was evaluated using cell-based assays. Mogamulizumab has ADCC activity against HH 
cells expressing CCR4, in a dose-dependent manner; 
- 
binding of the Fc domain to FcRn was evaluated using an ELISA and SPR.  
-  Mogamulizumab binding affinity  to CCR4-derived peptide 
- 
size variants High and Low Molecular Weight Species (HMWS and LMWS) . 
The drug substance was subjected to various stress conditions in order to characterize impurities. 
Impurities 
The applicant distinguishes between product-related impurities (molecular variants of the product arising during 
manufacture and/or storage, which do not have properties comparable to those of the desired product with 
respect to activity, efficacy, and safety), product-related substances (variants that have properties comparable 
to the desired product, are fully active, and have no deleterious effect on the efficacy and/or safety of the 
finished product) as well as process-related impurities (are derived from or introduced during the manufacturing 
process, such as cell substrates and raw materials used during upstream or downstream processing or 
contaminants). 
Product-related impurities were identified based on criticality assessment of each variant’s potential impact to 
the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety.  
The process-related impurities identified in mogamulizumab are HCP, HCDNA, residual protein A from 
purification process, contaminants (bacterial endotoxins, bioburden, mycoplasma and viruses), and cell culture 
media-derived components. The process-related impurities have been shown to be effectively reduced and/or 
controlled by the downstream process as assessed during development for commercial manufacturing process 
and process validation.

Specification 
The specification for the active substance include; appearance, pH (Ph. Eur.), protein concentration (UV), 
identity, HMWS and LMWS, charge variants, host cell protein, oligosaccharide profile, potency, bacterial 
endotoxins and microbial enumeration.   
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The validation of in-house methods is performed in line with 
recommendations as per ICH Q2 and is therefore deemed acceptable.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data from several lots were provided for all the batches manufactured with both process 1  and 
process 2. All the batches were compliant to specification in place at the moment of the release and confirm 
consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
A two-tiered system, comprised of a primary reference standard (PRS) and a working reference standard 
(WRS), is used for the commercial mogamulizumab reference standard.The history of the mogamulizumab 
reference standards (RS) lots has been provided by the applicant. 
The PRS is to be used for qualification of all the future WRS lots. The WRS is used for lot release and stability 
evaluation of the active substance and finished product (FP), and for requalification of the PRS in potency assay. 
Stability 
The Applicant claims an active substance shelf life of 36 months when stored at the designated storage 
condition. 
Long-term stability studies were performed as per the ICH Q1A and Q5C. In addition, stability studies were 
conducted under elevated and stress conditions to evaluate the effect on the active substance quality. The 
stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life in the 
proposed container. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
A comprehensive comparability assessment was performed to ensure the quality, safety, and potency of process 
1 (early clinical) and process 2 (Phase 3 and commercial). Release testing results of process 1 lots and process 
2 lots were provided and considered comparable. In addition, further characterisation has been performed. 
Stability data was also taken into account and no differences were observed for stability trends at accelerated 
and stressed conditions  between batches of process 1 and process 2.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Mogamulizumab finished product is presented as a sterile, single-use, ready-to-use preservative-free, 
practically free of particles and clear to slightly opalescent, colourless solution for intravenous (iv) 
administration.  
Each 10-mL vial contains 5 mL deliverable volume of mogamulizumab (20 mg) at a concentration of 4 mg/mL. 
The FP is provided in a 10-mL, Type I glass vial, sealed with a  rubber stopper, and clamped with an aluminium 
seal with a polypropylene flip-off cap. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
The excipients include polysorbate 80, glycine, citric acid monohydrate, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, 
and Water for Injection (WFI).  
Excipients comply with European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur.) and Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) and United States 
Pharmacopeia (USP). 
There are no excipients of human or animal origin and no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation.  
The choice of the formulation (glycine, citric acid, polysorbate) is mainly based on prior experience with other 
monoclonal antibodies. The formulation development studies support the chosen pH and concentrations of citric 
acid monohydrate, glycine and polysorbate 80. The amount of each excipient in the finished product is within the 
amounts commonly used for parenteral administration. From early clinical trials to commercial manufacturing, 
there have been no changes in the formulation and fill volume.  
Development 
During the course of development, mogamulizumab finished product has been manufactured at a number of 
filling facilities.  
Two finished product manufacturing processes were used during the development. Process 1 was the initial 
small scale  process; batches from process 1 were used for early nonclinical and clinical studies. Process 2 is a 
commercial-scale process. Process 2 was used to manufacture Phase 2/3 clinical batches and will be used for the 
commercial finished product manufacture.  
A detailed comparison of process 1 and process 2 has been provided. Several process changes were 
implemented at the time of the switch from process 1 to process 2 and are related to the upscaling of the 
process.  
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined by the route of administration, delivery system, dosage 
level, dosage form, dosage design, strength, container closure system, shelf life, storage temperature and 
finished product quality attributes. 
The overall product development was focused on the following design features: 
•  Product quality attributes are retained during manufacture, transport, and shelf life. 
•  Product is manufactured by a robust and reproducible process that provides a high assurance of quality. 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 18/115 
  
  
•  Product is provided as a sterile, low-endotoxin solution packaged in a container/closure system that is 
non-interactive and ensures product integrity for the intended shelf life. 
The critical quality attributes identified were:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
product related impurities,  
formulation-related attributes (excipient concentration, protein concentration, pH, osmolality),  
process/material - related impurities (impurities from active substance manufacturing process, 
impurities from excipients, impurities from container closure system, bacterial endotoxins and foreign 
particulates),  
general requirements (sterility, sub-visible particles, identity, appearance, potency, volume of the 
container), 
active substance-related quality attributes. 
Compatibility 
To support the use of mogamulizumab during administration to the patient, compatibility of the diluted finished 
product solution with the IV infusion bag and line was confirmed by performing an in-use compatibility study.It 
is demonstrated that the mogamulizumab solution diluted with normal saline can be stored at 25°C for up to 24 
hours in commonly used infusion bags and is compatible with commonly used infusion lines with filter. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The mogamulizumab finished product manufacturing process consists of seven steps: active substance (AS) 
thawing, formulation, sterile filtration, filling, stoppering and capping, inspection, and labelling and packaging. 
The commercial mogamulizumab finished product manufacturing process is described in detail and includes 
materials, process parameters, and IPCs for each process step. The IPCs allow to monitor the process 
performance consistency, and to ensure continuous production of the finished product of appropriate quality. 
There are no reprocessing or reworking steps in the finished product manufacturing process.  
The control strategy of manufacturing process for mogamulizumab finished product was proposed based on the 
results of a Process Characterization studies and confirmed through the PPQ. To continuously verify the process 
performance, critical steps of the manufacturing process were identified. IPCs for each critical step were set and 
will be continuously monitored during commercial production. The IPCs trends will be reviewed according to 
continued process verification protocol to identify potential improvements in the control strategy. 
When a result of an IPC testing does not meet the acceptance criteria for action, it triggers an investigation 
which is conducted in accordance with the internal quality management system, and associated procedures.  
Additional validation and/or evaluation activities, including filter validation, aseptic process simulation, 
manufacturing equipment qualification, and shipping validation, were successfully performed. Continued 
Process Verification (CPV) will ensure that the manufacturing process remains in a constant state of control 
during commercial manufacture. 
Process Performance qualification. 
The PPQ consisted of the primary PPQ and the supplemental PPQ. In the primary PPQ, several full-scale runs 
were conducted using the finished product manufacturing facility for the commercial production. After the 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 19/115 
  
  
completion of the primary PPQ, the supplemental PPQ was conducted to complement the primary PPQ. In the 
supplemental PPQ, full scale runs were performed using the same manufacturing process as in the primary PPQ 
except for some minor process refinements.   
Overall, the PPQ data demonstrated that the commercial manufacturing process has capability to produce 
consistent quality of the finished product. The primary and the supplemental PPQ results met the pre-defined 
acceptance criteria. 
The manufacturing process has been validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls 
are adequate. 
Product specification 
The finished product specifications to be used for the mogamulizumab commercial batch release and shelf-life 
testing include; appearance, pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter in injections (Ph. Eur.), 
volume in container (Ph. Eur.), protein concentration, identity, HMWS and LMWS, charge variants, host cell 
protein, potency, bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur.), sterility (Ph.Eur.) and container closuer integrity (Ph. Eur.).  
Analytical methods 
The analytical procedures used have been adequately described. Analytical methods were verified (compendial 
methods) or validated (non-compendial methods) according to the ICH Guideline Q2 (R2) and the current 
industry standards. Compendial assays such as particulate matter in injections, bacterial endotoxins, sterility, 
microbial enumeration and container closure integrity were evaluated for their suitability for use to control the 
finished product. Due to the differences in the active substance and finished product buffer composition 
specificity evaluation for identity, and potency was performed separately for AS and FP. All analytical procedure 
are deemed suitable for the control of the finished product.  
The justification of each specification is based on several batches which have been manufactured with the 
commercial process 2 (up till 2016). According to the provided information all these batches have been used in 
clinical studies (although not necessarily for the current requested indication: treatment of CTCL).  
Batch analysis 
Tabulated batch information and release testing results for mogamulizumab process 1 and process 2  batches 
are provided. The batch genealogy includes batch information with manufacturing process, manufacturing site, 
manufacturing date, batch size, and lot use. All process 2 batches were manufactured at commercial scale at the 
planned commercial manufacturing facility. The mogamulizumab batches were tested according to the 
specification in place at the time of product release. 
Batch analysis data of several active substance batches were provided. The results are within the specifications 
and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
The reference standard used in the analysis of mogamulizumab finished product is the same as that used for 
mogamulizumab acvtive substance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 20/115 
  
  
Stability of the product 
The long-term stability studies at 5°C were performed per the ICH Guideline Q5C. Stability studies at 
accelerated (25°C) and stress conditions were also performed.  
For the long-term stability study all vials were stored inverted. The commercial container closure system has 
been used.  
Based on the stability data obtained from the 3 primary and 3 supportive lots, the shelf-life of 36 months is well 
justified when the finished product is stored at the recommended condition of 5°C in 10-mL, Type I glass vial 
stoppered with a rubber stopper and clamped by a polypropylene flip-off cap with an aluminium overseal. The 
product should be protected from light. 
Comparability exercise for finished medicinal drug product 
A comprehensive comparability assessment was performed on finished product lots in order to bridge the 
manufacturing process from process 1 to process 2.Comparability of the finished products lots manufactured by 
the two processes was demonstrated using the release and stability accelerated (25°C) storage results. 
A second comparability assessment was performed in order to bridge the finished product manufacturing facility 
change Comparability of the lots manufactured using the two facilities was demonstrated using release testing 
and comparative stability evaluation at accelerated  and stress  storage conditions. 
As demonstrated by the comparative analysis of the release and stability data, both processes produce batches 
of comparable product quality. The results of these comparability assessments met the acceptance criteria in all 
cases, indicating that the product quality was equivalent, regardless of the process and/or facility used. 
Adventitious agents 
Information regarding the raw materials of biological origin used in the manufacturing process of 
mogamulizumab is deemed acceptable. Compliance with the TSE Guideline (EMEA/410/01 – rev. 3) is 
considered sufficiently demonstrated. 
The testing programme of cell banks and unprocessed bulk harvest batches for adventitious agents is adequate 
and in compliance with ICH Q5A. No adventitious agents, mycoplasma, microbial or viral, were detected. The 
presence in the MCB of non-infectious endogenous A-type retrovirus particles can be considered a typical 
feature of murine cell lines. Unprocessed bulk harvest tested negative for bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and viral 
contaminants.  
The mogamulizumab manufacturing process was investigated for its ability to remove/inactivate viruses: 
The manufacturing steps considered for virus validation studies are acceptable. Viral removal/inactivation 
capacity by the mogamulizumab manufacturing process was evaluated. The selected model viruses are 
appropriate, as enveloped and non-enveloped viruses are included. Moreover, XMuLV represents a specific 
model virus for the RVLP produced by the production cell line. Preliminary studies were properly carried out to 
evaluate interference and cytotoxicity.  
Overall, the safety of mogamulizumab towards adventitious agents is considered adequate.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
During the assessment a major objection was raised as two of the manufacturing sites did not have a EU GMP 
certificate. This major objection was subsequently resolved. Confirmation of EU GMP compliance of Kyowa 
Hakko Kirin site in Japan (responsible for active substance manufacturing, master cell bank storage, working cell 
bank storage and QC testing) was provided as part of the response to the D150 list of questions. Confirmation 
of EU GMP compliance for the finished product manufacturing site was received as part of the response to the 
D195 list of questions. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical development for mogamulizumab followed existing regulatory guidance for anticancer, 
biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals, specifically, the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Guidelines S9, S6 (R1), and M3 (R2). 
The nonclinical program included studies examining the anti-tumor activity of mogamulizumab, 
pharmacokinetic parameters after single-dose and repeat-dose intravenous administration, absorption, 
distribution, immunogenicity, immunotoxicity, cross-reactivity, single- and repeat-dose toxicology, and effects 
on embryo-fetal development. Based on comparable binding affinity for cynomolgus monkey and human 
lymphocytes and pharmacological activity (reduction in CCR4 expressing cells in peripheral blood) in 
cynomolgus monkeys and mogamulizumab did not bind to lymphocytes from dog, rat, or mouse, the 
cynomolgus monkey was selected as relevant species for evaluation of mogamulizumab in nonclinical 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology studies.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In Vitro 
Affinity Measurement of mogamulizumab against CCR4 Peptide Using Biosensor (Study d-04-405) 
The binding affinity of 4 different lots of mogamulizumab against CCR4 peptide (N terminal 12th to 29th amino 
acids) was determined by biosensor analysis using a Biacore 2000 instrument. The association rate constant 
(ka) ranged from 1.33 to 1.39 ×105 (mol/L)-1s-1.  
Affinity Measurement of mogamulizumab against FcγRIIIa Polymorphic Variants Using Biosensor (Study 
Number: d-15-0506) 
The binding affinity of mogamulizumab against FcγRIIIa polymorphic variants, 158 phenylalanine (FcγRIIIa (F)) 
or 158 valine (FcγRIIIa(V)), was determined by biosensor analysis using a Biacore T100 instrument. The 
dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) values to FcγRIIIa(F) and FcγRIIIa(V) were 9.95×10-7 and 9.49×10-8 
mol/L, respectively. 
ADCC Activity of mogamulizumab against Murine Thymoma EL-4 cells with Various Expression Levels of Human 
CCR4 (Study Number: d-04-319) 
Expression of human CCR4 on murine thymoma EL-4 (EL-4) cells and four human CCR4 gene transfected clones 
(CCR4/EL-4; KC1055, KC1057, KC1062, and KC1067) were determined by flow cytometry. Expression of 
human CCR4 on EL-4 cells was negative, whereas the CCR4/EL-4 clones expressed CCR4 at various levels as 
reflected by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) ratios (KC1055, 2.5; KC1057, 1.0; KC1062, 4.7 and KC1067, 
1.1). ADCC activity of mogamulizumab against EL-4 cells and CCR4/EL-4 clones was determined using a 
51Cr-release assay with human PBMC as effector cells. Cytotoxicity against EL-4 cells was minimal (2.2%), 
whereas those against CCR4/EL-4 clones were detected at various levels (Cytotoxicities: KC1055, 50.7%; 
KC1057, 11.7%; KC1062, 58.4% and KC1067, 20.6%). The percent cytotoxicity increased in proportion to the 
level of expression of human CCR4 on the target cell surface.

ADCC activity of mogamulizumab (0.0001 to 100 μg/mL) against CCR4 detectable (HH, CCRF-CEM, HuT78, 
TL-Om1, ATN-1, ATL102 and MT-2) and CCR4 undetectable (HUT102) cells was examined by a 51Cr release 
assay using human PBMCs from 3 adult healthy donors as effector cells. Robust ADCC activity was detected 
against CCR4 detectable cells. Maximum cytotoxicities were induced by 0.1 to 100 μg/mL of mogamulizumab 
and ranged from 46% to 79%. In contrast, ADCC activity against cells with undetectable levels of CCR4 
expression ranged from 14% to 23%. 
ADCC Activity of mogamulizumab against Tumor Cells from Patients with ATL (Study Number: NCU-04-002) 
ADCC activity of mogamulizumab was measured by a standard 51Cr release assay using a CD3-positive subset 
as target cells and a CD3-negative subset as effector cells in an autologous setting. The CD3-negative subset 
isolated from PBMCs from a healthy donor was used to provide control allogeneic effector cells. Target cells were 
stained with fluorescence conjugated anti-CD4, CD25 and CCR4 antibodies, and the proportion of CCR4 
expressing ATL cells, which were CD4, CD25 and CCR4 triple expressors, among target cells was analyzed by 
flow cytometry. The proportion of CD16 (FcγRIII) positive cells among effector cells was also analyzed by flow 
cytometry. 
In the allogeneic setting, ADCC activity of mogamulizumab (0.1 to 10 μg/mL) was detected in all cases. In the 
autologous setting, ADCC activity in the presence of 10 μg/mL mogamulizumab was demonstrated with 
cytotoxicities ranging from 14% to 64%. ADCC activity was detected in all but one (IM-11) of the samples.

Effect of mogamulizumab on Binding of CCR4 Ligands, MDC and TARC, to HuT78 Cells (Study Number: 
d-04-348, Report Number:r-08-152) 
To evaluate the potential effect of mogamulizumab on the binding of CCR4 ligands, the effect of mogamulizumab 
on binding of MDC and TARC to HuT78 cells was examined. Under conditions in which the binding of [125I]-MDC 
or [125I]-TARC was competed by unlabeled MDC or TARC, respectively, mogamulizumab (0.01 to 2375 μg/mL) 
did not affect the binding of [125I]-MDC or [125I]-TARC to HuT78 cells.  
Effect of mogamulizumab on CCR4 Expression (Study Number: d-04-316) 
HH cells were incubated with mogamulizumab (50 μg/mL) on ice for 60 minutes, and then further incubated at 
37°C for 0, 5, 15, 30 or 60 minutes. At each time point, residual cell surface expression of CCR4 was determined 
by fluorescence labeled anti-human IgG antibody to detect mogamulizumab using flow cytometry. The cell

surface expression of CCR4 at each time point (0, 5, 15, 30 or 60 minutes) was 100.0%, 96.9%, 87.4%, 85.3% 
or 81.3%, respectively.  
CDC Activity of mogamulizumab against Human T cell Lymphoma Cells (Study Number: d-04-317) 
CDC activity of mogamulizumab (0.0001 to 100 μg/mL) was measured using human serum and T cell lymphoma 
cells (TL-Om1 and HH cells) by a 51Cr release assay. No CDC activity was detected at any concentrations tested. 
Since it has been reported that CDC activity is suppressed by complement regulatory factors, such as CD55 and 
CD59, CDC activity of mogamulizumab was measured in the presence of neutralizing anti-human CD55 and 
CD59 antibodies. However, no CDC activity of mogamulizumab was detected.  
Reactivity of mogamulizumab to Human, Cynomolgus Monkey, Dog, Rat and Mouse Leukocytes (Study Number: 
03-055, Report number: 4566) 
Reactivity of mogamulizumab to human, cynomolgus monkey, dog, rat and mouse peripheral blood leukocytes 
was examined by flow cytometry using biotinylated mogamulizumab. Biotinylated human IgG1 was used as an 
isotype control antibody. Detection of mogamulizumab was done using PE labeled streptavidin. Mogamulizumab 
bound specifically to human and cynomolgus monkey lymphocytes, but not to lymphocytes from dog, rat or 
mouse. In human and cynomolgus monkey lymphocytes, the majority of the specific binding was seen in the 
CD4-positive subset. There was no specific binding of mogamulizumab to monocytes or granulocytes of any of 
the species tested. The reactivity of mogamulizumab to peripheral leukocytes was similar in human and 
cynomolgus monkey.

Lymphocyte 
Peripheral blood was stained with FITC labeled anti-CD4 antibody, biotinylated mogamulizumab or human IgG1 and PE labeled streptavidin, and 
then analyzed by flow cytometry. Three samples in each animal were analyzed and typical ones are shown here. Lymphocytes were gated in 
FS/SS dot plot and further plotted in FITC/PE dot plot.  
In addition, confirmation that the amino acid sequence of the mogamulizumab binding region was identical in 
humans and cynomolgus monkeys was established by CCR4 cDNA cloning.

ADCC Activity of mogamulizumab with Cynomolgus Monkey PBMCs (Study Number: d-04-360) 
ADCC activity of mogamulizumab (0.0001 to 100 μg/mL) against HH cells was examined by a 51Cr release assay 
using cynomolgus monkey PBMCs from 3 animals as the effector cells. ADCC activity was detected with all the 
PBMCs tested, and the cytotoxicity reached a maximum at a concentration of 1 or 10 μg/mL mogamulizumab.

Mogamulizumab was intravenously administered once to male cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels of 
0.0000725, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg (n=3/group). After the administration, CD4/CCR4 expressing cell 
count in peripheral blood was monitored by flow cytometry for 253 days. No mogamulizumab related changes 
were detected in clinical observations, body weight, haematology, blood coagulation parameters or blood 
chemistry. CD4/CCR4 expressing lymphocytes in peripheral blood were decreased by mogamulizumab 
administration at 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg.

Antitumor activity of mogamulizumab in TL-Om1 and HH xenografts was investigated in SCID mouse models. In 
the TL-Om1 xenograft model, mice bearing 101 to 171 mm3 tumors were selected. In the HH xenograft model, 
mice bearing 24 to 55 mm3 tumors were selected. In both models, 10 mice each were assigned to control and 
mogamulizumab treated groups. Saline (as vehicle) or mogamulizumab (20 mg/kg/day) was intravenously

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Effect of mogamulizumab on Human and Cynomolgus Monkey Platelets 
It has been reported that CCR4 is expressed on human platelets and CCR4 ligands (MDC and TARC) induce 
platelet aggregation, raising the potential concern that mogamulizumab may influence platelet function. 
Therefore, the effects of mogamulizumab on human and cynomolgus monkey platelet functions were 
investigated. In all studies in this section, no effects of mogamulizumab altering platelet function were observed. 
Binding of mogamulizumab to Human and Cynomolgus Monkey Platelets (Study Number: d-06-107, d-04-309) 
Binding of mogamulizumab and a commercially available anti-CCR4 antibody, clone 1G1, to human platelets 
was evaluated by flow cytometry. Double staining of human platelets with an anti-platelet marker antibody 
(anti-CD41a or CD41b antibody) and CCR4 antibody (mogamulizumab or 1G1) demonstrated that 1G1 bound 
specifically to human platelets but mogamulizumab did not. Binding of mogamulizumab to platelets was further 
investigated by incubating 0.2, 10 and 500 μg/mL of mogamulizumab with human or cynomolgus monkey whole 
blood. In whole blood, mogamulizumab showed no significant binding to human or cynomolgus monkey 
platelets. 
Effect of mogamulizumab on Human or Cynomolgus Monkey Platelet Aggregation (Study Number: d-04-310) 
The effect of mogamulizumab on platelet aggregation was evaluated using platelet rich plasma (PRP) prepared 
from human or cynomolgus monkey blood. In PRP from both species, mogamulizumab (0.2 to 2000 μg/mL) had 
no effect on platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or collagen. 
Effect of mogamulizumab on Human Platelet Aggregation (Report Number: r-06-300) 
The effect of mogamulizumab and 1G1 on platelet aggregation was also evaluated using TARC and low 
concentration ADP to induce platelet aggregation in human PRP. Both antibodies (100 μg/mL) showed no effect 
on platelet aggregation in this setting.

Effect of mogamulizumab on Platelet Count in Human Whole Blood (Study Number: d-11-054) 
After human whole blood was incubated with mogamulizumab (10 and 100 μg/mL) for a day, platelet count and 
the proportion of CCR4 expressing CD4-positive lymphocytes were measured. While mogamulizumab reduced 
the proportion of CCR4 expressing CD4- positive lymphocytes, there was no effect on platelet count. 
Effect of mogamulizumab on Cytokine Release- Human Whole Blood (Study Number: 06/019-023) 
The effect of mogamulizumab on release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) from whole 
blood obtained from 6 donors (3 atopic and 3 non-atopic) was investigated in vitro. Samples of human whole 
blood were incubated for 4 hours with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), a negative-control antibody (SM3, a 
non-binding variant of anti-CD52 antibody, 100 ng/ml), positive control antibodies (anti-CD52 antibody, 100 
ng/ml, and anti-CD3 antibody, 100 ng/ml) or mogamulizumab (1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 ng/ml). Then 
concentrations of TNF-α and IFN-γ in the supernatants were measured by ELISA. In all donors, mogamulizumab 
did not induce TNF-α release. In 5 of 6 donors, mogamulizumab did not induce IFN-γ release. In blood from one 
donor, a very high concentration (10000 ng/ml) of mogamulizumab induced IFN-γ release, which was a 
comparable to the level of response induced by anti-CD52 antibody. 
Effect of mogamulizumab on Cytokine Release - Human Whole Blood or PBMCs (Study Number: 14GR552) 
The effect of mogamulizumab on TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6 release was further investigated in vitro with a soluble 
phase assay using whole blood and a solid phase assay using PBMCs. In the soluble phase cytokine release 
assay, human whole blood (from 8 healthy donors) was incubated for 24 hours with either PBS (negative 
control), a negative-control antibody (anti-dinitrophenyl [DNP] isotype matched POTELLIGENT® antibody, at 
concentrations of 10, 100 and 500 μg/ml), a positive control (lipopolysaccharide, 1 ng/mL), a positive-control 
antibody (anti-CD3 antibody, 5 and 50 μg/ml) or mogamulizumab (1, 10, 100 and 500 μg/ml). TNF-α, IFN-γ and 
IL-6 concentrations in the supernatants were measured by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) method. In this 
assay, mogamulizumab increased TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6 release in samples from all donors compared to the 
negative-control antibody or PBS, but the cytokine concentrations induced by mogamulizumab were lower than 
those induced by the positive-control antibody. 
In the solid phase cytokine release assay, human PBMCs (from 8 healthy donors) were incubated for 48 hours 
with either PBS (negative control), a negative-control antibody (anti-DNP isotype matched POTELLIGENT® 
antibody, dry-coated at 1, 10, 100 and 250 μg/ml), positive-control antibodies (anti-CD3 antibody, dry-coated 
at 5 μg/mL and anti-CD28 superagonist antibody, dry-coated at 10 μg/mL) or mogamulizumab (dry-coated at 1, 
10, 100 and 250 μg/ml). TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6 concentrations in the supernatants were measured by an ECL 
method. In this assay, all donor PBMC samples that were incubated with mogamulizumab had elevated 
cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and most samples had elevated IFN-γ. In general, TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations 
were similar or equal to those produced by the positive-control antibodies. 
Effect of mogamulizumab on Cytokine Release from Human Whole Blood or PBMCs (Study Number: 
OX-14/128-014) 
The effect of mogamulizumab on TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-6 release was further investigated in vitro with a 
soluble phase assay using whole blood and a wet-coated phase assay using PBMCs. 
In the soluble phase cytokine release assay, human whole blood (from 6 healthy donors) was incubated for 24 
hours with either PBS (negative control), a negative-control antibody (human IgG1, at concentrations of 1 
μg/ml), positive-control antibodies (anti-CD3 antibody, anti-CD52 antibody and anti-CD28 superagonist 
antibody at concentration of 1 μg/ml) or mogamulizumab (6 and 50 μg/ml). Then concentrations of TNF-α, 
IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-6 in the supernatants were measured by Luminex. In this assay, compared to the 
Assessment report

negative-control antibody mogamulizumab produced statistically significant increases in TNF-α and IFN-γ 
release at 6 μg/ml, and IL-6 and IFN-γ release at 50 μg/ml. 
In the wet-coated phase cytokine release assay, human PBMCs (from 6 healthy donors) were incubated for 24 
hours with either PBS (negative control), a negative-control antibody (human IgG1, at concentration of 10 
μg/ml), positive-control antibodies (anti-CD3 antibody, anti-CD52 antibody and anti-CD28 superagonist 
antibody at concentration of 10 μg/mL) or mogamulizumab (10 μg/ml). Then concentrations of TNF-α, IFN-γ, 
IL-2 and IL-6 in the supernatants were measured by Luminex. In this assay, statistically significant elevated 
cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ) were observed in PBMC samples that were incubated with mogamulizumab 
compared to the negative-control antibody.

Effects on the Renal System 
In the single-dose toxicity study (Study QUK00001), there were no effects of mogamulizumab on the renal 
system in terms of serum chemistry (BUN, creatinine and electrolytes). 
Similarly, in the 4-, 13-, and 26-week toxicity studies (Study QUK00003, Study SBL033-033, and Study 
SBL303-139, respectively), no effects of mogamulizumab on the renal system in terms of serum chemistry 
(BUN, creatinine and electrolytes) and urinalysis were evident. In the single-dose iv/sc bridging study (Study 
FIA00527 and Study FIA00561), no effects of mogamulizumab on the renal system were observed with respect 
to serum chemistry (BUN, creatinine and electrolytes). 
Effects on the Central Nervous System 
In the single-dose toxicity study (Study QUK00001), there were no effects of mogamulizumab on the central 
nervous system in terms of clinical observations. In the 4-, 13-, and 26-week toxicity studies (Study QUK00003, 
Study SBL033-033, and Study SBL303-139, respectively), no effects of mogamulizumab on the central nervous 
system were observed with respect to clinical observations. Moreover, no mogamulizumab related changes were 
observed in the neurobehavioral and electrophysiologic assessment performed in the 4-week toxicity study 
(Study QUK00003, only for recovery period). In the single-dose iv/sc bridging study (Study FIA00527 and Study 
FIA00561), no effects of mogamulizumab on the central nervous system were observed with respect to clinical 
observations. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted as no drug-drug interactions were expected 
based on the putative mechanism of mogamulizumab. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of Analysis  
Distribution and absorption is studied by administration and subsequent detection of radioactive labeled 
mogamulizumab. Toxicokinetics of mogamulizumab and development of anti-mogamulizumab antibodies in the 
cynomolgous monkey were analysed using Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) or 
ElectroChemiLuminescence Assay (ECLA). All assays were validated and are in accordance with Guideline on 
bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009) except for the assay 8203-375, measuring 
amount of neutralizing anti–mogamulizumab antibodies, for which the deviations in the inter- and intra-assay 
accuracy and precision are too high. Results may thus be variable. In addition, for this assay it was noted that 
it was insensitive to an excess of drug, while data also show that only in absence of the drug itself, the presence 
of anti-mogamulizumab antibodies gives a positive signal. This means that in the presence of the drug itself, the 
amount of antimogamulizumab antibodies is no longer reliably measured and that the measurement of anti – 
mogamulizumab – antibodies in such circumstances will result in an underestimation of the amount of ADA.  
Absorption 
PK parameters after a single dose of 1 mg/kg [125I] mogamulizumab to cynomolgous monkey shows mean 
half-life (t1/2) of 5.42 days, a total clearance (CL) of 9.86 mL/day/kg and volume of distribution at steady state 
(Vss) of 67.6 ml/kg. Elimination from plasma is biphasic as it is a result of combination of target mediated 
disposition and FcRN mediated clearance. Administration of a single dose mogamulizumab ranging from 0.01 to 
100 mg/kg to male and female cynomolgous monkey reveals elimination half-life (t1/2β, representing the target

mediated disposition) of 3.81 to 20.8 days, a CL of 2.60 to 10.3 ml/day/kg, and a Vss of 48.6 to 90.8 ml/kg. 
Toxicokinetic analyses in the repeated dose toxicology studies indicate absence of sex-related differences and a 
dose proportional increase of Cmax and AUC and suggest a steady state after the tenth administration. In the 
26-week multiple-dose study maximum concentration (Cmax), AUC0-7d, and AUC0-∞ of mogamulizumab were 
higher as the dose level increased, yielding accumulation ratios of 2.6 to 8.2 across all dose groups. 
Mogamulizumab mean plasma concentrations in the pregnant females were similar to those measured in 
non-pregnant females, indicating that pregnancy had little influence on plasma levels of mogamulizumab.  
Detected anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against mogamulizumab appeared to increase clearance of 
mogamulizumab (See section on antigenicity).

radioactive labelled [125I] mogamulizumab. Excluding plasma and blood, the maximum percentage of 
radioactivity distribution among all tissues was in the spleen with 4.86%. Compared to the concentration in 
plasma (100%) this accounts for 26%. Compared to presence of mogamulizumab in plasma and blood, tissue 
distribution of [125I]mogamulizumab was relatively low. As the radioactive label can be removed from the 
antibody upon elimination, it cannot be excluded that a percentage of the label reflects radioactive label instead 
of radioactive labeled mogamulizumab.  
In the fetuses, plasma concentrations on Day 140 of gestation (caesarian sections) were approximately 60% of 
that measured in the dams, indicating that mogamulizumab readily crosses the placenta and distributes to the 
fetus, similar to endogenous IgG1. 
Metabolism 
Studies on the metabolism of mogamulizumab were not conducted. As a monoclonal antibody, the expected 
metabolic pathway occurs via normal catabolic degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
Excretion 
As a monoclonal antibody, no renal excretion is anticipated due to its molecular size. Therefore, studies to 
characterize the excretion routes of mogamulizumab were not conducted. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were conducted as no drug-drug interactions were expected in the 
case of a mAb drug. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
No other pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with mogamulizumab. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose Study in Cynomolgous Monkeys (Study Number: QUK00001, Non-GLP) 
Mogamulizumab was administered by slow bolus iv injection at doses of 0.01, 0.5, 4, 20, and 100 mg/kg to 
cynomolgous monkeys (n=1/sex/group). The monkeys were evaluated for changes in clinical observations, food 
consumption, serum chemistry, haematology (including flow cytometry analysis and coagulation parameters) 
for 14 days after dosing. Toxicokinetics (TK) and anti-mogamulizumab antibody development were also 
assessed. The highest dose level in this study (100 mg/kg) was 100 times higher than the anticipated clinical 
dose (1 mg/kg).

Mean mogamulizumab exposures (AUC0-∞) for the 0.01. 0.5, 4, 20 and 100 mg/kg dose groups were 0.973, 
126, 1310, 8020 and 27000 μg·day/mL, respectively. There were no deaths and no test article-related changes 
were noted in clinical observations, food consumption, serum chemistry, hematology and coagulation 
parameters. Peripheral blood immunophenotyping indicated there were reductions in specific populations 
beginning with the lowest dose tested in this study (0.01 mg/kg). There were decreases in CD3+CD4+CCR4+ 
lymphocytes, CD3+CD8+CCR4+ lymphocytes, and CD3+CD25+ lymphocytes. The reductions in 
CD3+CD4+CCR4+ and CD3+CD8+CCR4+ lymphocytes were anticipated pharmacologic activities of 
mogamulizumab. The reduction in CD3+CD25+ lymphocytes was most likely secondary to the decrease in 
CD3+CD4+CCR4+ lymphocytes. Therefore, mogamulizumab did not induce a toxicological response or 
unanticipated immunological effect at single doses up to 100 mg/kg.

A 4-week Repeat-dose Study in Cynomolgous Monkeys (Study Number: QUK00003, GLP) 
Mogamulizumab at doses of 0 (vehicle), 0.05, 1.2, and 40 mg/kg was administered to male and female 
cynomolgous monkeys per dose by slow bolus iv injection once weekly for 4 weeks to evaluate its potential 
toxicity (5/dose/sex), and assess the reversibility of any possible toxicity during a 3-month recovery period after 
dosing (2/sex/dose).  
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 39/115 
  
  
 
No deaths and no test article-related toxicities were observed in this 4 week, repeat dosing study. 
In peripheral blood immunophenotyping, the anticipated alterations were observed (decreases in 
CD3+CD4+CCR4+ lymphocyte count and CD3+CD8+CCR4+ lymphocyte count) which were related to the 
pharmacological activity of mogamulizumab. These reductions were identified on Day 2 and the lymphocyte 
subset counts continued to decrease up to Day 28. At study termination (Day 130), CD3+CD4+CCR4+ 
lymphocyte count had returned to baseline in the 0.05 mg/kg group but remained lower than baseline in the 1.2 
and 40 mg/kg groups, while CD3+CD8+CCR4+ lymphocytes recovered to baseline in all mogamulizumab 
treated monkeys. Decreases in CD3−CD16+ lymphocytes (NK cell) counts were noted in all dose groups, as 
well, which is probably attributable to an immediate but transient effect of mogamulizumab. IgG responses to 
KLH challenge were similar across all treatment groups. Therefore, humoral responses upon challenge with KLH 
or TT are regarded unaffected by mogamulizumab. Mild to moderate axonal degeneration in the thoracic spinal 
cord and posterior brainstem was identified in five mogamulizumab-treated monkeys (two animals in the 1.2 
mg/kg group and three animals in 40 mg/kg group). A similar finding in a vehicle control group monkey, 
however, was observed at the end of the recovery period in this study suggesting that this lesion may not have 
been attributable to treatment with mogamulizumab. This conclusion was strongly supported by reports that 
monkeys derived from the same shipment at the same test facility were found to have the same spinal cord 
lesion. Moreover, this lesion in nervous tissue was not observed in other repeat-dose toxicity studies we 
conducted in cynomolgous monkeys with mogamulizumab (13-week [Study SBL033-033], 26-week [Study 
SBL303-139], and an additional 4-week study [Study d-04-487]). 
Given that there were no deaths or toxicological findings related to mogamulizumab, the NOAEL under the 
conditions of this study was identified as the maximum dose used in the study, 40 mg/kg/week. 
A 13-Week Repeat-dose Toxicity Study in Cynomolgous Monkeys (Study Number: SBL033-033, GLP) 
Mogamulizumab at doses of 0 (vehicle), 2.5, 10, and 40 mg/kg was administered to male and female 
cynomolgous monkeys by slow bolus iv injection once weekly for 13 weeks to (5/sex/dose) including a 13-week 
recovery period (2/sex/dose). 
There were no deaths and no test article-related toxicities encountered in this study. One male (40 mg/kg) 
showed decreases in neutrophil count, albumin, albumin-to-globulin (A/G) ratio; increases in large unstained 
cell (LUC) count, fibrinogen, total protein, γ-globulin, and total cholesterol. Another male (10 mg/kg) showed 
increased globulin (mainly γ-globulin) and decreased A/G in one male from Week 6 of dosing. As no test 
article-related changes were observed in general condition, body temperature, morphology of leukocytes or in 
histopathology, these effects were not regarded adverse.  
In peripheral blood immunophenotyping, there were no test article-related changes in CD3−CD16+ lymphocyte 
(NK cell) at any dose level throughout the study period. The CCR4-expressing cells in lymphocytes were not 
evaluable appropriately in some animals possibly due to multi-staining.  
The NOAEL of mogamulizumab was considered to be 40 mg/kg under the conditions of this study. 
A 26-Week Repeat-dose Toxicity Study in Cynomolgous Monkeys(Study Number: SBL303-139, GLP) 
Mogamulizumab at doses of 0 (vehicle), 2.5, 10, and 40 mg/kg was administered to male and female 
cynomolgous monkeys by slow bolus iv injection once weekly for 26 weeks to evaluate its potential toxicity 
(3/sex/dose).  
There were no deaths and no test article-related toxicities were observed. In peripheral blood 
immunophenotyping, the anticipated alterations (decreases in CCR4 expressing lymphocyte ratio and count) 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 40/115 
  
  
were observed and related to the pharmacological activity of mogamulizumab. These reductions were identified 
in all males and females at 2.5, 10, and 40 mg/kg groups from Day 28 and throughout the study period.  
Anti-KLH antibody production in animals treated with mogamulizumab were similar to those in control animals 
after KLH sensitization. In the conditions of this 26-week repeat-dose study, the NOAEL of mogamulizumab was 
40 mg/kg. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxic assessment studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Carcinogenicity 
No nonclinical studies were conducted for carcinogenic risk assessment.  
Mogamulizumab has potent cytolytic activity against CCR4-expressing target cells, and has been shown in 
non-clinical studies in vivo to eliminate the CCR4-expressing cells. CCR4 is expressed on the Th2 cells, as well 
as Treg, Th17, and Th22 subsets of T cells, NK cells, macrophages, monocytes and platelets. The relationship 
between tumorigenesis and CCR4 expressing T cells is complex. There are reports suggesting that Th2 cell and 
Treg cells contribute to tumor growth in ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma and 
melanoma. On the other hand, there are also reports in the literature suggesting that Th2 cells and Treg cells 
may exert anti-tumor effects in classical Hodgkin lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. 
It has been reported that CCR4 knockout mice are viable, appear to develop normally, and show no overt 
morphological or behavioral defects. Moreover, tumor incidence in these mice has not been described. Although 
CCR4 expression was associated with increased tumor recurrence and impaired overall survival in patients with 
breast or gastric cancer, it was also reported that the expression of CCR4 does not affect the proliferation of 
breast cancer cells in vitro with or without thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), one of the 
endogenous ligands of CCR4.

Embryo-fœtal development (Study Number: SBL303-049,GLP) 
Mogamulizumab at doses of 0 (vehicle) or 40 mg/kg was administered iv once weekly (total of 18 doses) to 12 
pregnant cynomolgous monkeys in each group from the start of organogenesis (Day 20 of gestation [GD 20]) to 
GD 139 (late 3rd trimester), then animals underwent cesarean sectioning on GD 140, to investigate the effects 
of mogamulizumab on embryo-foetal development. In the 40 mg/kg group, foetal death was found in 1 dam on 
GD 100, and abortion occurred in 1 dam on GD 106. Abortion also occurred on GD 25 in 1 dam in the vehicle 
group. The loss incidence during the foetal development period in the 40 mg/kg group (2 of the 12 dams, 
16.7%) was within the range of the control background data (0.0% to 16.7%). Macroscopic torsion and stenosis 
of the umbilical cord were detected in the dam where fetal death occurred, and microscopic suppurative and 
haemorrhagic placentitis were observed in the dam with the aborted fetus. Both findings observed in the 
mogamulizumab treated group were considered to be incidental and unrelated to mogamulizumab. 
In peripheral blood immunophenotyping, no test article-related changes were noted in dams or fetuses, except 
for a decrease in CCR4 expressing lymphocyte count due to a pharmacodynamics activity of mogamulizumab, in 
both dams and fetuses. 
Following repeated dosing, plasma mogamulizumab concentrations after the 10th and last dosing increased 
compared with the concentration at the first dosing. The mean plasma mogamulizumab concentration in 
foetuses removed by cesarean sectioning on G 140 was 983340.0 ng/mL and the mean ratio of mogamulizumab 
concentration in fetuses to that in dams at 24 hours after the last dosing was 0.6. Anti-mogamulizumab 
antibodies were not detected in any maternal or fetal samples. Under the conditions of this study, a dose level 
of 40 mg/kg is considered the NOAEL of mogamulizumab for general toxicity in dams, reproductive function of 
dams, and embryo-foetal development.

bridging studies (Study FIA00527 and Study FIA00561), and 4-week repeat-dose study to evaluate the effects 
of mogamulizumab on the nervous tissue (Study d-04-487). No significant irritation or local tolerance issues 
were observed at the mogamulizumab injection sites in any studies.

26-week repeat-dose toxicity study (Study SBL303-139), embryo-fetal development study (Study 
SBL303-049), and single-dose iv/sc toxicity study (Study FIA00561). An anticipated decrease in CCR4 
expressing lymphocyte count was observed in all studies, consistent with the pharmacological actions of 
mogamulizumab. In the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study (Study QUK00003), decreases in NK cell count were 
noted but no changes were evident in lymphoid organ weights and pathological examination of lymphoid tissues 
indicated they were normal.

Evaluation of humoral immune response was carried out in the 4-week and 26-week repeat-dose toxicity studies 
by using KLH for all cynomolgous monkeys and TT for recovery monkeys in the 4-week toxicity study as the 
T-lymphocyte dependent antigen. Measurements of anti-KLH or anti-TT IgM and IgG titers were performed 
using an ELISA assay. Humoral responses to challenge with KLH or TT were unaffected by treatment with 
mogamulizumab. 
Dependence 
In compliance with ICH M3 (R2) guidance, dependence studies were not conducted since there is no evidence to 
suggest that there is the potential for drug abuse or misuse of mogamulizumab. In repeat-dose toxicity studies 
there were no test article-related neurobehavioral abnormalities. Moreover, there is no theoretical concern for 
drug dependence. 
Metabolites 
No studies on metabolites were conducted with mogamulizumab, as it is a monoclonal antibody (see also PK 
Section).  
Studies on impurities 
The potential impacts of impurities were assessed through toxicological evaluation of the mogamulizumab drug 
product. Comparability of mogamulizumab was verified between the drug substance lots and the drug product 
lots used in all in vivo toxicity studies and clinical trials. However, concern is raised on the comparability of 
mogamulizumab lot used in non clinical studies and the clinical ones (See Quality AR). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Mogamulizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk to 
the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), mogamulizumab is exempt from preparation of an Environmental 
Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
CCR4 is overexpressed on the surface of and/or expressed by a high percentage of the cancerous cells in T-cell 
malignancies such as CTCL, adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). In 
healthy individuals, CCR4 is according to the applicant selectively expressed on a subset of T cells, including 
Type 2 T helper (Th2) T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, expression on other cell types has been 
reported as well, including human memory Th17 cells, platelets, NK cells, monocytes, macrophages, and DCs 
(Scheu et al 2017*). 
Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry in the animal studies shows a consistent and statistical significant dose 
dependent decrease in CCR4 positive CD4 cells following mogamulizumab treatment. A statistical significant 
decrease in CD3+CD4+CD25+ cells is also observed. This population of cells is typed as activated 
T-lymphocytes by the applicant, but may also include regulatory T-cells. With regard to the influence of 
mogamulizumab on NK cells, CD8+ T cells and monocytes, the picture is less clear. The effect of 
mogamulizumab on Tregs alone (CD4+,CD25+, FOXP3+ and CD45RA+) and macrophages was not 
investigated. Reductions in CCR4+ T-cytotoxic/suppressor lymphocytes (CD3+/CD8+/CCR4+) seem to be dose 
independent. Reductions in NK cells are limited and dose independent and seem to be most apparent short after 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 46/115 
  
  
start the first dose. The effect of mogamulizumab treatment on the levels and function of Treg cells and on the 
different lymphocyte populations is investigated in humans (see clinical pharmacodynamics).  
Mogamulizumab can induce ADCC on cell lines KC1057 (Transfected EL-4 cell lines expressing very low levels of 
hCCR4) and HUT102 cells. It is assumed that these cell lines expressing very low levels of CCR4, undetectable 
by flow cytometry (FCM). This suggests that the detection threshold of CCR4 by FCM is just below the level at 
which minimal ADCC could be induced. Although from the non-clinical in vitro data a relation between CCR4 
expression and ADCC induction might be suggestive, clinically a relationship between CCR4 expression level and 
ADCC activity has not been established, however it can be assumed that CCR4 expression on skin infiltrating 
lymphocytes, albeit at very low levels, already result in a treatment effect.  
Two NK-cell related issues are identified that may interfere with mogamulizumab mediated ADCC; decrease (of 
functional) NK-cells due to underlying the disease and elimination of CCR4 expressing NK-cells. The level and 
functionality CCR4-expressing of NK-cells have not been monitored during clinical studies. If indeed a minority 
of NK cells expresses CCR4, a potential depletion would likely not have a measurable effect on the clinical 
response. Thus, the durable response does not exclude the potential of mogamulizumab mediated CCR4+ 
NK-cell depletion. It remains uncertain whether decrease of number and functionality of NK-cells related to the 
underlying disease influences the success of the treatment. 
A single intravenous treatment of mogamulizumab with dosages up to 100 mg/kg was well tolerated by 
cynomolgus monkeys, with no treatment-related alterations from cage side observations, or from evaluations of 
serum chemistry, hematology or coagulation parameters. No evidence of anti-mogamulizumab antibody 
formation was detected through Day 15. Toxicokinetic parameters were similar between groups dosed from 0.5 
to 100 mg/kg with an average elimination half-life of 18.2 days.   
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity.  
No mogamulizumab-related toxic effects in the male and female reproductive organs were observed in 
repeat-dose toxicology studies in sexually mature monkeys up to 26 weeks. The NOAEL of mogamulizumab was 
judged to be 40 mg/kg or greater since no toxicologically significant changes were observed in any examination. 
Carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have not been conducted with mogamulizumab. It is highly unlikely that 
mogamulizumab would react directly with DNA or other chromosomal material because mogamulizumab is a 
monoclonal antibody. As per ICH S6 (R1) guidance, no genotoxicity studies were conducted. No specific studies 
have been conducted to evaluate potential effects on fertility. 
In an animal reproductive and developmental toxicity study, administration of mogamulizumab to pregnant 
cynomolgus monkeys from the start of organogenesis through delivery did not show a potential for 
embryo-foetal lethality, teratogenicity, or foetal growth retardation. In general, IgG molecules are known to 
cross the placental barrier and mogamulizumab concentrations in foetus plasma were detected.  
Pharmacological activity of mogamulizumab was noted in fetuses as was evident from a decrease in CCR4 
expressing lymphocytes (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Prenatal and postnatal development studies were not conducted, according to ICH S9. No juvenile Toxicity 
studies were conducted with mogamulizumab, as it is not developed for pediatric indication.  
Local tolerance was evaluated in the context of single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies, where no findings which 
could suggest local injection site irritation were detected.  
Immunogenicity of mogamulizumab was evaluated in the single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies, the 
reproductive and developmental toxicity study and a single-dose iv/sc bridging study. Anti-mogamulizumab

antibodies were detected in some animals receiving a single i.v. dose of 0.0000725, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and10 
mg/kg, and also in some animals receiving repeat doses of 0.05 or 1.2 mg/kg (once weekly for 4 weeks).   
In the 26-week repeat-dose study, development of anti-mogamulizumab antibodies was observed in only one 
animal (1 female in the 2.5 mg/kg group). The plasma mogamulizumab concentrations of the animals in which 
anti-mogamulizumab antibodies were observed decreased more rapidly than the plasma concentration in 
animals that did not produce anti-mogamulizumab antibodies. There were no anti-mogamulizumab 
antibodies-related toxicological findings in the animals in which production of anti-mogamulizumab antibodies 
was observed. 
Mogamulizumab is a human IgG 1 monoclonal antibody and can reasonably be expected to be subject to the 
same degradative pathways as naturally occurring proteins so it is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment, therefore it is exempted from ERA studies as per the guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies on mogamulizumab are sufficient. Non-clinical information has been included in the 
SmPC section 5.3 and appropriate warnings under section 4.6.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods for the quantitative determination of mogamulizumab in human plasma and serum using 
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were developed and validated during the course of the clinical 
development program for mogamulizumab. 
The methods applied were adequately validated. Concerning the robustness of the analytical assay, the 
validation of the assay yielded acceptable results. With one exception, Incurred Sample Reanalysis (ISR) 
showed acceptable reproducibility (≥67% samples demonstrated the reanalysed values to be within ±30% of 
Assessment report

their initial values). After a slightly modified analysis method, subsequent ISR was adequate for all other 
analyses. 
Population modelling was conducted using NONMEM Version 7.3. In this pop-PK analysis, plasma or serum 
mogamulizumab concentration data from 444 subjects with ATL or CTCL who received mogamulizumab over a 
dose range of 0.01 to 1.0 mg/kg in 6 clinical studies were used (Studies 0761-0501, 0761-002, 0761-003, 
0761-004, 0761-009 and 0761-010).  
The selected pop-PK model was a two-compartment model with linear clearance for description of the 
mogamulizumab PK. PK of mogamulizumab administered at doses of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg were 
described. The results of the non-parametric bootstrap showed that the median of the bootstrap parameters are 
in line with the population estimates. The bootstrap 95% confidence intervals did not contain the null value for 
any covariate effects. Graphical evaluations of the final model suggested adequate performance. Shrinkage for 
CL was low (5%). Other metrics suggested adequate performance. 
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
The bioavailability of mogamulizumab is 100% per definition, since it is administered as a IV infusion. 
In Study 0761-002, a Phase 2, multiple-dose study conducted in Japan in subjects with CCR4-positive relapsed 
ATL (n=27), mogamulizumab was administered at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg by iv infusion weekly for 8 weeks. Serial 
plasma samples for PK analysis were collected after the first and eighth doses; additional samples were collected 
pre-dose and at the end of infusion of the second through seventh doses. The mean plasma concentration-time 
profiles are shown in Figure 8, with PK parameters on day 1 and 8 summarised in Table 22. Maximum plasma 
levels were generally obtained at end of infusion.

Bioequivalence  
No bioequivalence studies are needed for this product, since it is an aqueous solution administered via i.v. 
infusion.  
Influence of food 
Pharmacokinetics of mogamulizumab is not expected to be affected by food, since it is administered via i.v. 
infusion. 
Distribution 
Based on pop-PK analysis, the geometric mean [% coefficient of variation (CV%)] central volume of distribution 
(Vc) was 3.57 L (20.1%).   
Elimination 
Based on pop-PK analysis, the geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) clearance (CL) is 12.0 ml/h 
(83.7%). The geometric mean elimination half-life (t1/2) is 17 days (65.5%), which is similar to the t1/2 of 
circulating endogenous human IgG (approximately 21 days). Similar to other IgG1-class antibody proteins, 
mogamulizumab is believed to be degraded by enzymatic proteolysis into small peptides and amino acids in the 
same manner as endogenous IgG. Under steady-state conditions at a 1.0 mg/kg dose, CCR4 binding sites are 
expected to be saturated.

Inter- and intra-individual variability in exposure was estimated based on observed Cmax values, simulated 
AUC(0-τ),ss levels and subsequent mixed effect modelling. Inter-individual variability was mild to moderate, 
i.e., 21.6% and 36.9% for Cmax and AUC, respectively, Intra-individual variability was mild, i.e., 16.7% and 
11.23%, respectively. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
In Study 0761-0501, Cmax and AUC0-7 days values after four repeated administrations of iv mogamulizumab once 
weekly at doses of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg in subjects with CCR4-positive ATL or subjects with 
CCR4-positive PTCL were evaluated for linearity by applying a linear model (power model) using the 
log-transformed value of each parameter and the log-transformed dose. The estimates of μ and β and 95% 
confidence intervals for Cmax and AUC0-7 days are presented below. 
The graphs for Cmax and AUC0-7 days as a function of dose, expressed as untransformed and logarithmic numbers, 
are presented in Figure 9. The 95% confidence interval of estimate of β for both Cmax and AUC0-7 days included 1.0, 
indicating linearity over the dose range of 0.01 to 1.0 mg/kg.

Time dependency 
In Study 0761-0501, the mean accumulation ratio for AUC0-7 days after the 4th dose ranged from 2.15 to 3.48.  In 
Study 0761-002, plasma Cmax and Cmin increased with repeated doses of mogamulizumab; however, steady 
state was not attained after eight repeated doses given once weekly (see Figure 8). The mean accumulation 
ratio after the 8th weekly dose was 2.87 for AUC0-7 days. The t1/2 after the 8th dose was 422±147 hours 
(17.6±6.1days, mean ± SD), similar to the t1/2 of approximately 21 days for normal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). 
The time course to steady-state for mogamulizumab Cmin was predicted using the pop-PK model with the dose 
regimen employed in Studies 0761-009 (Subjects with relapsed/refractory ATL) and 0761-010 (subjects with 
relapsed/refractory CTCL) (i.e., 1.0 mg/kg, once weekly for 4 weeks and then once every 2 weeks) (Figure 10). 
Steady state was achieved approximately after the 8th dose (12 weeks) with an accumulation ratio of 
approximately 1.7-fold for Cmin and Cmax. The median simulated Cmin achieved at the 1.0 mg/kg dose at 
steady-state was approximately 14 µg/ml.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The PK of mogamulizumab was only evaluated in patients with ATL and CTCL. The effect of disease type (i.e., 
ATL (n=129, 29.1%) or CTCL (n=315, 70.9%)) and clinical subtypes on mogamulizumab CL was evaluated by 
pop-PK analysis. Of the 129 ATL subjects included in the analysis, 73 subjects (56.6%) were classified as acute 
type; 37 subjects (28.7%), lymphomatous type; and 19 subjects (14.7%), chronic type. Of the 315 subjects 
diagnosed with CTCL; 173 subjects (54.9%) were classified with Mycosis Fungoides (MF) type and 142 subjects 
(45.1%) with Sezary Syndrome (SS) type. Neither disease type nor clinical subtype were identified as 
statistically significant covariates on mogamulizumab CL (Figure 11).

Special populations 
Renal impairment. Mogamulizumab is an antibody with a molecular mass of 149 kDa and is therefore not 
expected to be excreted in urine. Therefore, formal studies in patients with renal impairment to study the effect 
of renal function are considered not necessary. The expected lack of effect of mild and moderate renal 
impairment is confirmed by the pop-PK analysis, in which 157, 80 and 2 patients (out of 444 patients in total) 
with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment were included. 
Hepatic impairment. No direct effect of hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of mogamulizumab is expected 
because antibodies are principally cleared by catabolism. Still, in the provided pop-PK study, mogamulizumab 
PK was shown to be dependent on hepatic function, albumin and AST. In this model, including 80 patients with 
mild, and 3 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (out of 444 patients in total), mogamulizumab exposure 
(i.e., AUC(0-τ),ss) was estimated to be approximately 61% and 129% of the reference for low and high albumin 
concentration, 119% and 77% of the reference for low and high AST, and there was a 12% reduction in subjects 
with mild to moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Based on the 
exposure-response analysis, none of these factors affected either efficacy or safety and therefore it is agreed 
that no dose modification is needed under these conditions. 
Gender. In the provided pop-PK study, PK data from 240 male (54.1%) and 204 (45.9%) female patients were 
included. Mogamulizumab PK was shown to be dependent on gender. In this model, mogamulizumab exposure 
(i.e., AUC(0-τ),ss and Cmax) at a 1 mg/kg dose was estimated to be approximately 30% higher in female compared 
to male subjects, i.e, estimated AUC(0-τ),ss and Cmax were approximately 5217 mg.h/l and 10.1 mg/l in male, vs 
6793 mg.h/l and 14.6 mg/l in female. Based on the exposure-response analysis, gender does not affect either 
efficacy or safety and therefore no dose modification is needed for male or female patients.  
Race. Overall, patients with a White (224), Asian (93, of which 87 Japanese), Black or African American (74), 
Native American or Alaska Native (1), Pacific Islander (1) background were included in the pop-PK analysis. No 
marked differences in mogalizumab exposure were observed between these different ethnic populations. 
Weight. Due to the body weight based dosing, Cmin,ss increases with increase in weight. The Cmin,ss after 1 mg/kg 
weight-based dosing was 2 fold higher in the highest weight quintile compared to the lowest weight quintile. 
Exposure-analyses indicated that, despite the somewhat lower exposure in low weight patients, this does not 
affect efficacy in a negative manner. With respect to safety, a trend is observed for increased safety at higher 
exposure at higher weight (i.e. for infections and infestations, as well as gastrointestinal disorders). Considering 
the nature of these safety issues, this is considered not sufficient to limit the dose ate a certain weight. 
Age was not a statistically significant covariate for mogamulizumab PK. Clinical studies included subjects aged 
from 22 to 101 years old. A relatively large proportion of patients, i.e., 43,5%, was >65 years of age, which is 
in line with the relatively late age of occurrence of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).

Based on pop-PK data, the presence of ADAs did not significantly affect mogamulizumab CL. Further, disease 
type (ATL or CTCL) and clinical subtype (acute, lymphomatous and chronic type ATL, MF and SS type CTCL), 
ECOG performance status as well as CCR4 expression did not significantly affect mogamulizumab CL. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies have not been conducted (see discussion on clinical pharmacokinetics).  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Not applicable. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Mogamulizumab binding to CCR4 directly targets a cell for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
activity. As a defucosylated antibody, mogamulizumab induces greater ADCC activity against CCR4-expressing 
target cells compared with conventionally fucosylated antibodies. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Biomarker analysis 
CCR4 expression (Study 0761-010) 
Patients were enrolled in the study irrespective of their CCR4 expression status. Since mogamulizumab targets 
cells expressing CCR4, the potential clinical utility of testing for CCR4 expression status prior to treatment was 
investigated by assessing the relationship between CCR4 status and effect of treatment for primary and key 
secondary endpoints. 
Analysis method: The CCR4 status of subject samples (formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded human tissue) from 
this trial were analyzed with a pre-planned analysis at the completion of the trial using the VENTANA CCR4 Assay 
with a 10% cutoff for CCR4 expression status (i.e., CCR4 percent positive malignant lymphocytes ≥ 10% versus 
CCR4 percent positive malignant lymphocytes < 10%). This cut off was based on literature using the same 
anti-CCR4 mAb (KM2160, which is a parent antibody of mogamulizumab) (Ishida, 2003; Ogura, 2014). 
Patients analysed: Of the 372 patients in the ITT, 311 (84%) were analysed for CCR4 expression. Of these 311 
subjects, 290 (78% of ITT) had biopsies that were evaluable for tumour CCR4 results (n=150 vorinostat and 
n=140 mogamulizumab).  
Expression level: The median percent CCR4 expression level of the 290 patients with evaluable CCR4 on a 
continuous scale was 80% and the range was (1%, 100%). Approximately 97% (280 subjects) had ≥10% CCR4 
expression. The remaining 10 subjects (3.4%) had <10% CCR4 expressing malignant lymphocytes. 
Efficacy by CCR4 expression: The ORR as a function of percent CCR4 expression is depicted below.

Figure 12. Scatterplot of CCR4 Expression Percentage and Overall Response Rate Based on 
Investigator’s Assessment CCR4 ITT Set. 
In patients expressing ≥10% CCR4, the Investigator based ORR was 45.3% (n=48) in the mogamulizumab arm 
vs. 10.8% (n=11) in the vorinostat arm. In the 10 patients expressing <10% CCR4, no patients obtained a CR 
or PR, resulting in an ORR of 0% in both arms. Two of the 6 patients with <10% CCR4 in the mogamulizumab 
arm had a response to treatment in individual compartments. Similar results for ORR in patients with <10% vs. 
≥10% CCR4 expression were obtained with the independent review based analysis. 
PFS of CCR4 expressing subjects receiving mogamulizumab was significantly longer than those of CCR4 
expressing subjects receiving vorinostat (9.4 months [5.77, 14.03] vs 3.1 months [2.87, 4.63], respectively; 
HR=0.50 [0.37, 0.68], p < 0.0001;) (see section of Clinical Efficacy). Varying the CCR4 positivity cut points from 
10% through 90% in order to select CCR4-expressing patients did not significantly increase median PFS of the 
mogamulizumab (CCR4-expressing) population as compared to the mogamulizumab (ITT) population.  
CCR4 expression MF, SS and other CTCL subtypes in literature 
A literature review was performed to investigate whether CCR4 is expressed in all subtypes of CTCL. Nineteen 
articles were identified between the years 2000-2016 containing relevant CCR4 expression data including MF, 
transformed MF, SS, pcALCL, PTCL unspecified, lymphomatoid papulosis, and other T-cell lymphomas. Prior 
published CCR4 prevalence has been reported from 79%-100% in MF patients, and the percentage of CCR4 
positive lymphocytes ranged from 1-90%. Prior published CCR4 prevalence has been reported from 83%-100% 
in SS patients, and expression levels ranged from 0-100%. When CTCL subtypes other than MF and SS, were 
examined for CCR4 prevalence and expression using category A testing (similar to pivotal study 0761-010), 
prevalence ranged from 38-100% and expression from 10->50%, with the exception of other T cell tumours 
(15% prevalence, no data on CCR4 expression). 
Natural ligands 
Concentrations of CCL17/TARC and CCL22/MDC were analysed as a measure of clinical activity following 
treatment with mogamulizumab or vorinostat. There were no apparent differences in TARC/MDC concentration 
trajectories in responders versus non-responders based on the visual inspection of subject trajectories.

FGR3A polymorphisms 
There did not appear to be apparent differences in response rate between FGR3A genotype categories (i.e. 
Phe/Phe, Phe/Val and Val/Val). 
Secondary Pharmacodynamics 
ECG/QT prolongation Study 0761-010  
Electrocardiograms (12-lead) were performed at baseline, if clinically indicated during treatment, and at the End 
of Treatment visit. A total of 35 subjects in the vorinostat group and 104 subjects in the mogamulizumab group 
had valid assessments of QTcB and QTcF both at baseline and at the end of the randomized treatment period 
(difference from total treated due to subjects who crossed over from vorinostat to mogamulizumab and those 
continuing randomized treatment in both groups). Among these subjects, there were no marked mean or 
median changes from baseline or differences between treatment groups. Shifts to higher QTcB and QTcF values 
appeared to be somewhat more frequent among subjects receiving mogamulizumab compared to those 
receiving vorinostat; however, the differences in number of subjects assessed makes comparisons difficult. 
Table 25 Shifts from Baseline in QTcF Interval (msec) During Randomized Treatment Period (Safety 
Analysis Set) 
Among subjects in the mogamulizumab group with any post-baseline ECG assessments, including scheduled 
and unscheduled measurements, increases from baseline in QTcF of >30 msec were observed for 8 of 109 
(7.3%) subjects and increases of >60 msec were observed for 3 (2.8%) subjects. No increases in QTcF of this 
magnitude were observed among subjects in the vorinostat group with post-baseline assessments (n=35). The 
three subjects in the mogamulizumab group with increases in QTcF of >60 msec.  
During the crossover portion of study, Subject 125-004, who had a pre-treatment (prior to start of randomized 
treatment period) QTcF of 466 msec, had a value of 556 msec measured at an unscheduled visit at the start of 
crossover. This value was indicated as clinically significant and was reported as AE of electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged (Grade 3) on Day 183 of study (Day 1 of crossover treatment); the AE was considered possibly 
related to both vorinostat and mogamulizumab. 
The relationship between mogamulizumab concentration and change in QT interval was evaluated using data 
from 43 subjects in Study 0761-009. There was no apparent relationship between mogamulizumab 
concentration and ΔQTcF.

Figure 13 Relationship between Observed Mogamulizumab Concentrations and QTcF Change from Baseline (ΔQTcF) 
(Study 0761-009) 
This result is expected as large molecule monoclonal antibodies such as mogamulizumab have low potential to 
cause QT prolongation. 
Exposure-effect relationships 
There was no apparent relationship between mogamulizumab exposure (Cmin,1st or AUC(0-τ)ss) and efficacy (PFS 
and ORR) with the exception of a modest relationship between AUC(0-τ)ss and ORR. In the latter case, the number 
of overall responder increased with increasing exposure at steady state. With respect to safety, the Applicant 
concluded that there is no evidence that AEs were related to Cmin,1st or AUC(0-τ)ss. No apparent relationship was 
observed between mogamulizumab exposure and QT interval. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of mogamulizumab was evaluated in adult patients with T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma 
(ATL) and CTCL over a dose range of 0.01 to 1 mg/kg administered as multiple doses of mogamulizumab every 
week or every 2 weeks, and included the recommended 1.0 mg/kg dose and regimen (days 1, 8, 15 and 22 for 
the first 28-day cycle and on Days 1 and 15 for subsequent 28-day cycles). The population PK analysis included 
444 patients receiving mogamulizumab in six clinical trials. The exposure to mogamulizumab increased 
proportionally with dose over the dose range of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg. 
Mogamulizumab is dosed via intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely bioavailable. 
Based on a population PK analysis, the geometric mean [% coefficient of variation (CV%)] central volume of 
distribution (Vc) was 3.57 L (20.1%). This rather small distribution volume suggests that mogamulizumab is 
only minimally distributed to the extravascular tissues. These values are similar to those of other IgG1-class 
antibodies. Mogamulizumab PK was shown to be dose proportional up to a 1.0 mg/kg dose. 
The metabolic pathway of mogamulizumab has not been characterised. Mogamulizumab is expected to be 
degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 60/115 
  
  
 
Based on a population PK analysis, the geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) clearance (CL) is 12.0 
mL/h (83.7%) and geometric mean elimination half-life (t1/2) is 17 days (65.5%).   
Mogamulizumab exhibits linear PK from the dose in a dose range of 0.01 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg. Based on a 
population PK analysis, the steady-state concentrations of mogamulizumab were reached after 12 weeks of 
repeated dosing when administered using the recommended regimen, and systemic accumulation was 1.7-fold. 
On a power model analysis, no deviation from dose proportionality was evident. 
The effect of renal impairment on the clearance of mogamulizumab was evaluated by a population PK analysis 
in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CrCL] between 60 and 89; n= 157), moderate (CrCL between 59 and 
30; n= 80), or severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min; n= 2). No clinically important differences in 
the clearance of mogamulizumab were found between patients with mild to severe renal impairment and 
patients with normal renal function.  
The effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance of mogamulizumab was evaluated by a population PK analysis 
in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin [TB] less than or equal to the upper limit of normal [ULN] 
and AST greater than ULN or TB less than 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST; n= 80) or moderate (TB greater than 
1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST; n=3) hepatic impairment. No clinically important differences in the clearance 
of mogamulizumab were found between patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and patients with 
normal hepatic function. Mogamulizumab has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (TB 
greater than 3 times ULN and any AST). 
The effects of various covariates on the PK s of mogamulizumab were assessed in population PK analyses. The 
following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of mogamulizumab: age (range: 22 to 101 years), 
sex, ethnicity (other than Japanese, limited data are available in other ethnic populations), renal impairment, 
mild or moderate hepatic impairment, disease subtype (mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sézary Syndrome (SS)), 
degree of CCR4 expression or ECOG status, although it should be noted that patients with ECOG PS ≥2 were 
excluded from the clinical trials. 
Exposure-Response analysis indicated that efficacy was not correlated with mogamulizumab exposure in the 
pivotal study. Efficacy, as measured by improvement in PFS based on investigator assessment, was not 
associated with increasing mogamulizumab exposure (see section 5.2 of the SmPC).   
The majority of the samples was classified as non-conclusive for ADA, due to the fact that the mogalizumab 
concentrations exceeded the ADA assay tolerance levels. However, additional efficacy and PK data of the few 
patients classified as positive for ADAs do not indicate an effect on these parameters. The applicant is currently 
in the process of developing and validating a new ADA assay with a higher DTL. It is anticipated that with the 
enhanced ADA assay having an increased DTL, it may be possible to detect ADA in the subjects who were 
previously determined to be inconclusive using the current assay. If the data from subjects that were previously 
considered “inconclusive” will with the new test be classified as ADA positive, the Applicant should re-analyse 
the effect of ADA on safety, efficacy and mogamulizumab PK.  
While, two of the 6 patients with <10% CCR4 in the mogamulizumab arm had a response to treatment in 
individual compartments, no confirmed responses were observed in the few MF/SS patients with CCR4 
expression <10%. In addition, a larger PFS improvement was observed for mogamulizumab in ≥10% CCR4 
expressing patients (6.3 months: 9.4 with mogamulizumab vs. 3.1 with vorinostat) compared to the ITT (4.6 
month improvement), in which also patients with CCR4 expression <10% were included. Furthermore, in a PFS 
analysis by CCR4 expression cut off point, a trend for increasing PFS HR was observed with increasing CCR4 
expression levels. In vitro, ADCC seems to be more effective with higher CCR4 intensity (number of receptors

per cell). The possible consequence of potential differences in CCR4 intensity in relation to efficacy in vivo, or to 
different CTCL subtypes is largely unknown.  
The initially proposed target population included patients with all subtypes of CTCL. However, very limited data 
was provided for CTCL subtypes other than MF and SS.  Further extrapolation of data in MF and SS to non-MF/SS 
subtypes was considered problematic (see discussion on clinical efficacy). As literature review indicated that the 
prevalence of CCR4 expression varied to a large extent in other subtypes of CTCL than observed in MF or SS in 
the pivotal trial. As the CCR4 is needed for mogamulizumab binding and thus activity, it was of concern that a 
lower prevalence of CCR4 positivity, to as low as 38% of the subjects, was published for other CTCL subtypes 
than MF and SS with similar category A testing as the pivotal trial. This low prevalence would imply that the 
majority of patients (within the subtype) do not express the target of mogamulizumab, and would not benefit 
from mogamulizumab treatment. Given the important role of CCR4 in the pathophysiology of MF/SS and the fact 
that all evaluable subjects tested positive for CCR4 at a minimum of 1% of skin infiltrating lymphocytes in the 
largest randomized-controlled trial ever conducted in MF/SS, it was concluded that MF and SS can be considered 
as inherent CCR4 positive diseases and that thus there is no need to restrict the indication to subjects with CCR4 
positive disease nor to mention the target in the indication. 
From the literature it is known that vorinostat could lower CCR4 expression in vitro. It was planned to analyse 
CCR4 expression levels in cross-over patients, but these results were not included in the dossier. During the 
second round of assessment, the applicant indicated that samples were only collected in 18% of patients and 
CCR4 expression levels were therefore not analysed. Nevertheless, the ORR data suggest that CCR4 expression 
levels in cross over patients were still sufficient to obtain a response on mogamulizumab. 
Based on the data provided, for the AEs skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, general disorders and 
administration site conditions as well as gastrointestinal disorders, a trend of increased reporting upon increased 
mogamulizumab exposure was noted. Considering the nature of these safety issues, this is considered not 
sufficient to limit the dose at a certain weight. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of POTELIGEO has been sufficiently characterised and all available information has 
been reflected in the SmPC. 
The CHMP recommends that the applicant submits the report on the development and validation of the new 
enhanced ADA assay with a higher DTL which is anticipated to be available by 1Q-2Q 2019.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
In ex vivo tests using human cells that were CD4+ CD25+ CCR4+, mogamulizumab was shown to exhibit 
significant ADCC activity at concentrations of 0.1 to 10 μg/mL (Ishida, 2004). Based on a PK simulation using PK 
parameters calculated from relapsed CCR4-expressing ATL patients (n=27) in a Phase 2 study (0761-002), the 
proposed dosing regimen was predicted to result in minimum mogamulizumab serum concentrations ≥ 10 
μg/mL. 
Phase 1/2 study KW-0761-001 
Open label, multi-center (US), dose escalation Phase 1/2 study KW-0761-001, investigated the safety, PK, 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), and preliminary efficacy of mogamulizumab

monotherapy in patients with CTCL (n=41; MF or SS) or PTCL (n=1) who had failed at least one prior systemic 
therapy. 
No dose limiting toxicities were observed for doses up to and including 1.0 mg/kg, when administered once 
weekly for 4 weeks followed by administration every 2 weeks until progression at doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 
mg/kg. 
The number of patients per cohort (n=3) were too limited to select a dose based on efficacy results. One best 
overall response of CR was observed in the 0.1 mg/kg cohort (cohort 1) and one in the 1.0 mg/kg cohort of the 
dose escalation Phase. One additional CR was reported in extension Phase 2 of the study, in which 30 patients 
were treated in total. PR was observed in 3 patients in Phase 1 (1 patient in 0.1 mg/kg cohort, and 2 in 0.3 
mg/kg cohort) and 8 patients in Phase 2 of the study.

Response in skin and blood was evaluated every 4 weeks. Response in lymph nodes and viscera was evaluated 
at 4 weeks, then every 8 weeks in the first year, and then every 16 weeks thereafter. 
Sample size 
The reference median PFS for vorinostat was assumed to be 169 days. The median PFS for mogamulizumab 
therapy was predicted as 254 days, a 50% improvement over this reference median. A total of 255 PFS events 
was required given 90% power, and a total sample size of 288 patients was considered necessary for 255 PFS 
events to occur within the projected 36 months of the trial. Applying a 10% inflation factor to this total (about 
29 patients) to take into account those patients that may be lost to follow-up prior to documented progression, 
a total of 317 patients were planned to be enrolled. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to either mogamulizumab or vorinostat. The randomization to treatment 
groups was stratified by disease type (MF or SS) and disease stage (IB/II or III/IV). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. Blinding of treatment groups was not considered appropriate due to different 
routes of administration (IV vs. oral) and different side effect profiles. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analysis sets 
Intent-to-treat (ITT): Includes all patients randomized to a therapy (mogamulizumab or vorinostat) and 
assigned a study number. 
Efficacy evaluable set: Includes all patients who received the first cycle of treatment (at least one dose) and who 
had a baseline tumour assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment for response.  
Primary endpoint analysis 
The primary efficacy variable was PFS based upon the assessment by the Investigator, defined as the time from 
the day of randomization to a treatment arm until documented PD or death due to any cause.  
The primary comparison of PFS between mogamulizumab and vorinostat was performed on the ITT set based 
upon the results of the on-site investigator’s assessment using a stratified Log-rank test at the one-sided 2.5% 
significance level. A Cox proportional hazard model with treatment, disease type, disease stage, and region 
Assessment report

Page 66/115 
  
  
(U.S., Japan, and Rest of World) as covariates was used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference in 
PFS.  
PFS censoring rules 
The following censoring rules were applied: 
- 
In the event that a randomized patient withdrew from the study for any reason before documented 
progression, the time from the day of randomization to the last post-baseline tumour assessment from 
any compartment (skin, blood, bone marrow, lymph node, or viscera) was used as a censored time 
point. 
- 
For patients who were randomized to a treatment arm but had an unknown baseline assessment for a 
compartment, the PFS time was censored at the randomization date if there was no post-baseline 
tumour assessment for that compartment or if there was any evidence of lymphoma in that 
compartment at post-baseline evaluation. 
- 
For patients randomized to a treatment arm who withdrew from treatment prior to the first 
post-baseline tumour assessment for any reason other than disease progression, the PFS time was 
censored at the last documented visit. 
- 
For patients who initiated a new anticancer therapy (including crossover to mogamulizumab) in the 
absence of a PFS event, the PFS time was censored at the last tumour assessment (from any 
compartment) prior to the start of the new anticancer therapy. 
- 
For patients not known to have died or have documented progression as of the data cut-off date for 
primary analysis, the PFS time was censored at the date of the last tumour assessment (from any 
compartment) prior to data cut-off.

Recruitment 
The study was initiated in Dec 2012 (first dose). The clinical data cut-off date was 31 Dec 2016. 
Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol was dated 19 Jun 2012 and was subsequently amended 8 times. Protocol deviations 
were observed in a large proportion of patients in both arms (56.5%). No substantial imbalances in type of 
protocol deviations were observed between treatment arms. The protocol deviations and amendments are not 
considered to have impacted the analysis or interpretation of most important efficacy outcomes.

Baseline data 
 Table 26: Baseline Demographic Characteristics (ITT set) 
In the ITT set, 54.8% of patients had MF, and 45.2% SS. Most patients had stage III or IV (62.4%), and the 
median time from initial diagnosis was 3.1 years. CCR4 expression was ≥ 10% in 75.3% of patients (and the 
analysis was missing in 22%).

Table 27. Baseline Disease Characteristics (ITT Set). 
Except for one patient, all randomized patients had received at least one prior systemic CTCL therapy. The vast 
majority (>80%) had received more than one prior systemic therapy. When specified by disease stage it is 
noted that stage IB/II subjects were the most heavily pretreated population enrolled in the study.

Concomitant medication 
Use of premedications recommended prior to infusion of mogamulizumab (acetaminophen or paracetamol orally 
and diphenhydramine 50 mg iv or equivalent antihistamine) was more frequent in the mogamulizumab arm. 
Other medications used by a higher percentage of patients in the mogamulizumab arm were primarily 
anti-infective agents. A higher rate of anti-propulsive use was observed for patients receiving vorinostat 
(23.7%) compared to those receiving mogamulizumab (3.3%) during randomized treatment. The use of 
steroids was comparable between subjects randomized to mogamulizumab and those randomized to vorinostat, 
but higher in the stage III/IV subjects (48%) than in the stage IB/II subjects (19%). Among the Safety Analysis 
Set, pruritus medication use was similar for the two treatment groups: 136 (73.1%) patients in the vorinostat 
group and 140 (76.1%) patients in the mogamulizumab group. 
Numbers analysed 
The ITT population included 372 patients: 186 in the mogamulizumab arm, and 186 in the vorinostat arm. The 
Efficacy Evaluable Set included 361 patients. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint -  PFS by investigator 
At the time of data cut-off (31 Dec 2016), a total of 241 PFS events had been observed based on investigator’s 
assessment, 110 (59.1% of patients) in the mogamulizumab group and 131 (70.4%) in the vorinostat group.

Table 30. Summary of PFS by Investigator and IR (ITT Set) 
Figure 15. Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS by Investigator (ITT set) 
Censoring: The majority of censored observations were due to patients who discontinued randomized treatment 
without documented disease progression per CTCL response criteria. The percentage of patients who were 
censored due to discontinuation for AE or intolerance was higher for the vorinostat group than for the 
mogamulizumab group, while the percentage of patients who were censored due to discontinuation for clinical 
progression was similar for the two treatment groups. 
When specified for disease stage it was noted that an AE was a far less common reason for censoring in subjects 
with less advanced disease (stage IB/II) treated with mogamulizumab (11.1%) compared to subjects with 
advanced disease (stage III/IV, 22.4%). In contrast, compared to stage III/IV subjects, a higher percentage of 
stage IB/II subjects treated with mogamulizumab were censored due to withdrawal of consent (18.5% vs. 8.2%

for stage IB/II vs. stage III/IV, respectively), withdrawal prior to first post-baseline assessment (7.4% vs. 2%) 
and “other reasons” (14.8% vs. 2%). 
Sensitivity analyses: Four sensitivity analyses were performed for PFS during the randomized treatment period 
based on Investigator’s assessment and the ITT Set. Across all analyses, the results favoured mogamulizumab 
with a HR between 0.52-0.72. However, a difference in HR between stage IB/II disease and stage III/IV disease, 
and between subpopulations with or without blood involvement is notable (see also Table 31) .

Cross-over population: For the 133  patients who crossed over from vorinostat and received mogamulizumab, 
median PFS calculated from the first dose of mogamulizumab was 8.87 months (95% CI: 5.37, 14.77).  
Secondary endpoints 
The below table summarises ORR and DOR, and response by compartment. The study demonstrated statistically 
significant improvements in ORR and response by compartment in the blood, skin, and lymph nodes as 
compared to vorinostat. Response in the viscera could not be evaluated due to limited efficacy data in subjects 
with visceral involvement; the benefit-risk of mogamulizumab in subjects with visceral involvement is currently 
undetermined due to lack of data.

The results from the Skindex Symptoms Scale for disease-specific symptoms showed statistically significant 
longitudinal, between-group differences at cycles 3, 5, 7 and 9 favoring mogamulizumab (p<0.05);statistically 
significant differences favouring mogamulizumab in the proportions of patients who improved, remained stable 
or declined based on the minimum important difference (MID) threshold at cycles 3, 5 and 7 (p<0.05); and 
median time to clinically meaningful deterioration of 27 months vs 7 months, favoring mogamulizumab 
(non-significant). Based upon the MID thresholds established at each cycle,disease-specific symptoms improved 
in 47.8% (cycle 1) 61.1% (cycle 3), 64.5% (cycle 5),67.1% (cycle 7), 67.7% (cycle 9), and 84.1% (cycle 11) of 
mogamulizumab-treated subjects. 
The FACT-G Functional Well-Being instrument for cancer-specific functioning results showed differences 
favoring mogamulizumab at cycles 3, 7 and 9 (p<0.05); statistically significant differences favoring 
mogamulizumab in the proportions of patients who improved, remained stable or declined based on the MID 
threshold at cycle 3 (p<0.05); and median time to clinically meaningful deterioration of 8 months vs 4 months, 
favoring mogamulizumab (p<0.05). Based upon the MID thresholds established at each cycle, cancer-specific 
functioning was improved in 31.5% (cycle 1), 39.2% (cycle 3), 39.4% (cycle5), 45.8% (cycle 7), 46.3% (cycle 
9), and 41.7% (cycle 11) of mogamulizumab-treated subjects.

Ancillary analyses 
Patients with stage IB/II disease treated with mogamulizumab had confirmed ORR of 17.6% compared to 
8.3% for vorinostat, and compartment level (blood, skin, lymph node) response rates that were higher than 
those for vorinostat treated patients (Table 34). Overall, the median period of progression free survival for 
stage IB/II subjects treated with mogamulizumab was 4.7 months compared to 3.9 months for 
vorinostat-treated patients (Table 35).  In patients with stage IB/II disease, given the limited number of 
subjects with a response and immaturity of the data, no conclusion on duration of response can be made. 
Time to compartment level response in Stage IB/II patients was approximately 3 months, which is consistent 
with time to response for the ITT population overall (approximately 3 months). If a compartment level 
response or overall response is not observed after 3 months of treatment, discontinuation of treatment should 
be considered.

Study 0761-004: Single arm Phase 2 Study conducted in Japan, investigating mogamulizumab in a.o. 8 patients 
with CTCL (7 MF and 1 pcALCL).  All patients received 1.0 mg/kg mogamulizumab IV, administered 8 times at 
one-week intervals. All 8 CTCL patients had a PFS event, with a median Investigator based PFS of 3.4 months 
(95% CI 1.0, 5.4). There were 3 responders among the 8 patients (37.5%), which included the patient with 
pc-ALCL. All 3 responders had PR. The duration of response was not reported. The KM estimate of OS was 17.1 
months (95% CI 3.7,-). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Clinical efficacy of mogamulizumab in the treatment of patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sézary 
syndrome (SS) has been investigated in pivotal Study 0761-010, a Phase 3, multinational, open label trial of 
anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody mogamulizumab versus vorinostat in 372 adult patients randomised 1:1 to 
treatment with either mogamulizumab or vorinostat.  
Each arm enrolled 186 patients. Mogamulizumab infusion was administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg once weekly 
for the first 28-day cycle (on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22), and on days 1 and 15 of subsequent 28-day cycles. 
Vorinostat was administered at a starting dose of 400 mg orally, once daily beginning on day 1 for 28-day 
cycles. Vorinostat patients with disease progression or unacceptable toxicities were permitted to cross over to 
mogamulizumab therapy. Crossover patients received up to 46 months of mogamulizumab therapy, as of 
December 2016 data cut. Treatment with mogamulizumab continued until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune diseases, central nervous system metastasis, and 
medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medicinal products, or an 
active infection requiring therapy, including HIV, or hepatitis B or C. Patients with ECOG performance status ≥2 
were also excluded. At study baseline, 38% had stage IB-II disease, 10% stage III, 52% stage IV. This study 
included patients regardless of their baseline level of CCR4 expression in skin biopsy. 
Patients were a median age of 64 years at the time of screening (range 25 to 101 years), 49.5% were 65 years 
or older, and 58.1% were male.  
All patients had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of either mycosis fungoides (MF), 56.5%, 53.2%, or Sézary 
Syndrome (SS), 43.5%, 46.8%, in the mogamulizumab and vorinostat groups, respectively, and had received 
at least one prior systemic therapy. As expected, a high proportion of patients (~70% of EU patients) previously 
received bexarotene, the only registered treatment for CTCL in the EU. Other prior systemic therapies were 
interferon (59%), methotrexate (49%), extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) (31%) and gemcitabine/ 
gemcitabine regimens (28%). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) based on investigator assessment using a 
global composite response criteria that took into account all potentially affected disease compartments (skin, 
blood, lymph nodes and viscera). PFS is considered an acceptable primary endpoint, in particular as CTCL is 
characterized by frequent recurrences and an indolent course in early stages reflected by the relatively long OS. 
However, clinical relevance of the observed effect should be reinforced by supportive secondary endpoints. The 
primary endpoint is based on investigator assessment, which is acceptable as it is more representative of clinical 
practice in this disease where visual skin inspection is an important part of response assessment. Moreover, 
investigator based PFS provided a more consistent application of the Olsen et al guidelines compared to IR PFS, 
and can be considered, therefore, more reliable in terms of diagnosis of progression and response data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 83/115 
  
  
Response in skin and blood was evaluated every 4 weeks. Response in lymph nodes and viscera was evaluated 
at 4 weeks, then every 8 weeks in the first year, and then every 16 weeks thereafter.  
The median duration of exposure with mogamulizumab was 5.6 months (range: <1 to 45.3 months). 56% of 
patients received mogamulizumab for at least 6 cycles, and 25% of patients received mogamulizumab for at 
least 12 cycles.  
CCR4 expression was assessed retrospectively on pretreatment skin biopsies (formalin fixed paraffin 
embedded) using immunohistochemistry. In the mogamulizumab arm, baseline CCR4 expression levels were 
available in 75% of patients (N=140). CCR4 was detected on ≥1% of lymphocytes in 100% of patients, and 96% 
(134/140) had CCR4 detected on ≥10% of skin lymphocytes.  
Responses are measured by the global response score (GRS; Olsen 2011), investigating the impact of treatment 
in different body compartments. This is recommended by EORTC/ISCL, and therefore regarded acceptable.  
The effect size of mogamulizumab is not compared to treatment regimens used in the EU. Moreover, vorinostat 
has been approved in the US for progressive, persistent or recurrent disease on or following two systemic 
therapies, this represents a later line of therapy as claimed in the proposed indication for mogamulizumab, and 
thus further questions placing the obtained results for the current pivotal trial in context. Additionally, the fact 
that patients were allowed to cross-over to mogamulizumab in case of progression on vorinostat, and even when 
unable to tolerate vorinostat treatment, complicates interpretation of available OS and PFS data for 
mogamulizumab.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The recommended dose of POTELIGEO is 1.0 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over at least 60 
minutes. It should be administered weekly on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of the first 28-day cycle, followed by infusions 
every two weeks on Days 1 and 15 of each subsequent 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. 
Mogamulizumab treatment resulted in a statistically significant improvement in investigator-based PFS,  with a 
HR of 0.53 and a median improvement of 4.6 months with mogamulizumab compared to vorinostat (7.7 vs. 3.1 
months, respectively).  
At 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the start of randomised treatment, the percent of subjects alive without 
disease progression was higher for mogamulizumab (55.3%, 38.3%, 28.0%, and 14.1%, respectively) 
compared to vorinostat (28.8%, 15.3%, 7.2%, and 7.2%, respectively). Median PFS for the mogamulizumab 
group was 7.70 months (95% CI: 5.67, 10.33) and 3.10 months (95% CI: 2.87, 4.07) for the vorinostat group 
with resultant hazard ration of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.69), p<0.0001 (2-sided, stratified log rank test).  
The PFS effect size was not consistent across subgroups; subgroup analyses indicate that the effect size of PFS 
depends on the stage of disease. The available data demonstrate a clinically relevant PFS advantage with 
mogamulizumab compared to vorinostat in subjects with SS (median PFS 13.3 vs. 3.13 months, respectively, 
HR 0.32, p<0.0001) and with advanced disease (stage III/IV, median PFS 10.9 vs. 3 months, HR 0.36, 
p<0.0001). In the less advanced patients a limited 0.8 months advantage in PFS was observed with 
mogamulizumab vs. vorinostat (median PFS 4.7 vs. 3.9 months, HR 0.88, p=0.7166). In line with the PFS 
subgroup analysis, ORR was lower for patients with MF (risk difference 13.9, p=0.0042), than for patients with 
SS (34.7, p<0.0001). Also in subjects with less advanced disease (stage IB/II) ORR was lower (9.3, p=0.0896) 
than in the ITT. Still, the frequency of confirmed ORR in stage IB/II subjects receiving mogamulizumab 
treatment (17.6%, 12/68) was higher than in those receiving the comparator vorinostat (8.3%, 6/72). 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 84/115 
  
  
Response rates by compartment showed that responses were in particular observed in the blood compartment, 
i.e. patients with blood involvement. Supportive dose escalation study 0761-001 also showed a lower rate of 
response (28.6%) in patients with MF, than patients with SS (47.1%). Overall, the available data confirm that 
subjects with less advanced disease and with no blood involvement seem to experience a reduced clinical benefit 
with mogamulizumab compared to patients in advanced stages and/or with blood involvement. On the other 
hand, most analyses still point to better outcomes with mogamulizumab compared to vorinostat, and 
encouraging (yet far from outstanding) rates of skin responses have been observed in this subpopulation of 
patients with less advanced disease without blood involvement. 
Of the patients randomised to vorinostat, 136 patients (73.1%) crossed over to mogamulizumab during the 
study. Reasons for crossover to mogamulizumab were disease progression (109 patients) and treatment 
intolerance (27 patients). The number of infusions of mogamulizumab administered to crossover patients 
ranged from 1 to 94 (up to 46 months of treatment) as of the December 2016 datacut.  
At  the  time  of  data  cut-off  for  analysis,  23.4%  (87/372)  of  randomized  subjects  had  died  [47,  vorinostat 
(25.3%); 40, mogamulizumab (21.5%)]. OS data were largely immature; this is not unexpected, since subjects 
with MF often have a chronic disease course. Further, interpretation of OS data is hampered buy the crossover 
design. It is noted, however, that no sign of any possible detrimental effect of mogamulizumab on OS can be 
observed, which is reassuring. 
The The results from the TTF analysis showed a 3-month advantage with mogamulizumab (HR 0.58); median 
time to treatment failure was significantly longer for mogamulizumab (5.80 months) than for vorinostat (2.87 
months) (p<0.0001). which is overall consistent with the primary PFS analysis. As expected, due to the study 
design,  causes  for  treatment  failure  differ  between  the  two  treatment  arms,  discontinuation  of  randomized 
treatment  due  to  PD  according  to  CTCL  criteria  (40.9%)  or  AEs  (15.1%)  being  the  main  causes  in  the 
mogamulizumab  arm  and  initiation  of  a  new  anti-cancer  treatment  (71.5%)  in  the  vorinostat  arm.  In  this 
regard, it is noted that discontinuation due to PD according to CTCL criteria was the earliest TTF event only in the 
6.5% of all patients who received vorinostat. 
Interpretation of the difference in time to next line therapy (TTNT) (11 months vs 3.5 months), is complicated 
by the cross over design as patients in the control group may be more prone to starting next line systemic 
therapy than the mogamulizumab treated patients. Still, it is considered unlikely that this bias will account for 
the full magnitude of the estimated difference. Notably, in chronic conditions with a remitting/relapsing 
behaviour such as MF, TTNT represents a useful endpoint to also assess the actual clinical benefit obtained with 
a single treatment beyond the strict criteria often used to define disease progression in clinical trials. Of note, 
TTNT was not defined in the statistical analysis plan and thus concerns a post-hoc analysis.  
The open-label design is also hindering interpretation of the QoL PRO data for demonstration of benefit, although 
it may be reassuring that some of the parameters showed improvement in QoL. Further, as MF and SS patients 
can suffer tremendously from symptoms related to their disease (eg, pain, pruritus, fatigue, sleep disturbance) 
and  the  social  stigma  of  having  obvious  unsightly  skin  lesions,  having  a  durable  response  could  also  be 
interpreted as beneficial to the patient. In this context it can be agreed that the response rates of 28% with a 
median DoR of 14 months, obtained using a stringent global composite assessment, is clinically meaningful.  
Altogether, the difference in median PFS of 4.6 months (HR 0.53; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.69; p<0.0001) is considered 
clinically relevant when compared to the observed median PFS and supported by ORR+ DOR and TTNT. 
The possibility to assess the efficacy of mogamulizumab in subjects with lower levels of CCR4 expression has 
been limited as data are available for only 10 subjects with <10% CCR4 positive lymphocytes in skin biopsies 
who were treated with mogamulizumab. No confirmed responses were noted, 3 subjects experienced a 
compartment level response to mogamulizumab; 2 of 6 initially randomised to mogamulizumab and 1 of 4

subjects randomized to vorinostat and crossing over to mogamulizumab. While, two of the 6 patients with <10% 
CCR4 in the mogamulizumab arm had a response to treatment in individual compartments, no confirmed 
responses were observed in the few MF/SS patients with CTCL expression <10%. In addition, a larger PFS 
improvement was observed for mogamulizumab in ≥10% CCR4 expressing patients (6.3 months: 9.4 with 
mogamulizumab vs. 3.1 with vorinostat) compared to the ITT (4.6 month improvement), in which also patients 
with CCR4 expression <10% were included. Furthermore, in a PFS analysis by CCR4 expression cut off point, a 
trend for increasing PFS HR was observed with increasing CCR4 expression levels.  
Therefore, in the context of the indication in MF and SS there is no need to specify that the disease should be 
CCR4 positive. However, the uncertainties on the clinical benefit of mogamulizumab in subjects with low CCR4 
expression need to be described in the SmPC (section 5.1). 
The initial proposed indication included all subtypes of CTCL, but no data had been provided in other subtypes 
than MF or SS, except for 1 patient with pcALCL achieving a PR in the supportive Phase 2 study 0761-004; the 
indication was later revised to include MF and SS patients.    
Despite the low frequency of patients (~15%) in the mogamulizumab arm that received only 1 prior treatment, 
additional analysis suggested almost similar PFS and response rates in mogamulizumab treated subjects with 1 
or 2 prior treatment lines. Therefore the indication specifies “at least one prior systemic therapy’.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of mogamulizumab in terms of 4.6 months improvement in PFS supported by the ORR+DoR and 
TTNT is a beneficial and clinically relevant effect in the context of a relapse/remitting disease where patients 
continue through therapies, which makes this product with a new mode of action a valuable additional treatment 
option for MF/SS.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data of mogamulizumab, administered as monotherapy is available from 7 clinical studies in patients with 
T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, PTCL, and ATL;  
Figure 17). From these studies, several safety  populations were defined (i.e. the pooled CTCL population, all 
patients with T cell lymphomas (i.e. CTCL and other T cell lymphomas), and for all patients with T cell 
lymphomas other than CTCL). The data from the pivotal Phase 3 Study 0761-010, including the cross-over 
population are discussed here, where relevant supplemented by data from the other safety populations.  
Similarly, also the post-marketing experience in Japan (approved patient populations with CCR4- expressing 
T-cell lymphomas, including CTCL, PTCL and ATL, estimated exposure 3700 patients, data cut-off 31 May 2017), 
will be included in the discussion when relevant. 
Of note: the pivotal Phase 3 Study 0761-010 contributed to 79.0% (184/233) of subjects to the pooled data of 
all subjects with CTCL, and CTCL represents 59.6% (233/391) of all subjects with T-cell lymphomas. Also, there 
are differences in the protocol-defined reporting of AEs between studies conducted in Japan and in the Rest of 
the World. In Japan (Studies 0761-002 and 0761-004), if signs or symptoms of illness were atypical or very 
severe, both the individual Patient exposure signs or symptoms and the underlying diagnosis were to be 
reported as AEs. In Study 0761-0501 (also in Japan), the symptom or diagnosis was reported as an AE. In the 
other 4 studies (Studies KW-0761-001, 0761-007, 0761-009, 0761-010), the underlying illness or diagnosis 
(when known), instead of signs or symptoms, was to be recorded as the AE.

Patient exposure 
A total of 542 subjects received at least 1 dose of mogamulizumab monotherapy in the 7 clinical studies included 
in this dossier. 
Table 39 Protocol-defined Dose and Treatment Duration by Study. 
A total of 233 subjects with CTCL received at least 1 dose of mogamulizumab monotherapy as initial treatment 
in 3 clinical studies: 184 in study 0761-010, 41 in dose finding study KW-0761-001 and 8 in single arm Phase 2 
study 0761-004. All subjects in Study 0761-010 and nearly all subjects with CTCL in the pooled safety data 
(99.6%, 230/236) received mogamulizumab 1.0 mg/kg. Six subjects with CTCL received mogamulizumab ≤ 0.5 
mg/kg. 
The design of the pivotal study contemplated a single cross-over from the comparator arm to mogamulizumab, 
based on disease progression and/or occurrence of intolerable adverse events. Of the 186 patient initially 
randomised to vorinostat, 138 crossed over to mogamulizumab.

Study 0761-010  
At the time of cut-off date in Study 0761-010 at 31 Dec 2016, the median number of 28 day-cycles during the 
randomized treatment period was 6 in the mogamulizumab arm (170 days), and 3 in the vorinostat arm (84 
days). The median relative dose intensity was 97.49% for mogamulizumab, and 95.12% for vorinostat.   
Among subgroups in the mogamulizumab arm, a difference emerges between disease subtypes the length of 
treatment, which was longer in SS (295 days) than MF (208 days) patients. These data are consistent with the 
longer exposure observed in patients with a more advanced stage of disease (184 vs 281 days in stage IB/II and 
III/IV respectively, this latter including MF stage III/IV and SS). In the control arm, exposure was longer in MF 
(164 days) than SS (122 days) and exposure was rather similar between the disease stages (151 vs 140 days 
for stage IB/II and stage III/IV disease respectively). 
For those subjects who crossed over to treatment with mogamulizumab, the median number of cycles initiated 
during the cross-over portion was 7 (169.0 days).   
During randomisation, 103 (56.0%) subjects in the mogamulizumab received ≥ 6 cycles, and 50 (27.2%) 
subjects received ≥ 12 cycles. In the cross-over group, 76 (55.9%) subjects received ≥ 6 cycles 
mogamulizumab, and 35 received ≥ 12 cycles. 
Long term safety data are available from 155 subjects (48.9%) exposed for ≥6 months and 74 subjects (23.3%) 
exposed for >12 months. More subjects were exposed long-term to mogamulizumab than vorinostat. 
Dose modifications 
Study 0761-010  
During the randomized treatment period, 35.5% (n=65) of patients in the mogamulizumab arm had at least one 
dose withheld, and 70 (38%) subjects did not receive the total planned dose for a given infusion. The reasons for 
withholding of a dose (drug eruption, thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased, neutrophil count 
decreased/neutropenia, infusion related reaction) are among the most commonly observed AEs.

Table 40. Summary of Drug Dosing Status During Randomized Treatment Period (Safety Analysis 
Set Study 0761-010). 
There were no major demographic and disease characteristic differences in the group of patients at the time of 
crossover from vorinostat to mogamulizumab when compared to those initially assigned to mogamulizumab. 
Adverse events 
Safety was assessed by reported adverse events (AEs), changes in physical examinations, vital sign 
measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and laboratory analyses until 90 days after the last dose or initiation 
of alternative therapy, whichever came first. Events that occurred beyond 90 days after the last dose that were 
considered to be related to the study treatment, were included as TEAEs. 
The investigators evaluated all AEs as to seriousness, severity, causality, start and stop dates, action taken with 
study drug, and outcome. 
During the randomized treatment period in Study 0761-010, almost all patients experienced at least one TEAE 
(97.3% in the mogamulizumab arm and 99.5% in the vorinostat arm; The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs 
was lower for mogamulizumab (84.8%) compared to vorinostat (95.7%). The incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was 
similar between the 2 treatment groups (42.4% vs 45.7%), the incidence of treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs 
was lower for mogamulizumab (25.5%) compared to vorinostat (34.9%). 
For cross-over patients, the incidence of all TEAEs was similar (93.4%) to the incidence in the mogamulizumab 
arm during the randomized treatment period. However, incidences of treatment-related TEAEs, and all (or 
related) Grade ≥3 TEAEs were lower for patients who crossed over compared to patients in either treatment 
group during the randomized treatment period. 
During the randomized treatment period in Study 0761-010, the incidence of TEAEs by severity was similar 
between treatment groups. Approximately one-third of subjects in each treatment group had TEAEs of 
maximum Grade 3 severity, and less than 10% of subjects had TEAEs of maximum Grade 4 or 5 severity.

TEAEs that occurred with higher frequency in the mogamulizumab group than in the vorinostat group included 
infusion-related reaction (33.2% vs 0.5%) and drug eruption (23.9% vs 0.5%) and pyrexia (16.8% vs 5.9%). 
The majority of these events were mild or moderate in severity; Grade ≥3 infusion-related reaction occurred in 
3 (1.6%) subjects, and Grade ≥3 drug eruption occurred in 8 (4.3%) subjects in the mogamulizumab group. 
When pooled by SOC, higher incidences (≥10% difference) of TEAEs in the mogamulizumab group compared 
with the vorinostat group was noted for SOC Infections and Infestations (64.1% of subjects in the 
mogamulizumab group vs. 50.0% in the vorinostat group) with higher rates of upper respiratory tract infection, 
folliculitis, and oral candidiasis (none of ≥ Grade 3 severity), SOC Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders 
(52.7% vs. 41.9%, respectively) with higher rates for drug eruption, and Injury, SOC Poisoning and Procedural 
Complications (44.0% vs. 15.1%, respectively) with higher rates for infusion reactions. For other SOCs and 
individual preferred terms, the frequency in the mogamulizumab group was either comparable to or lower than 
that observed for vorinostat. 
Compared with Study 0761-010, the incidence of Grade 3, 4 or 5 TEAEs was higher in the pooled data for all 
subjects (overall [51.9% and treatment-related [37.1%] than in the mogamulizumab group in Study 0761-010 
(overall [42.4%] and treatment-related [25.5%]). 
Related Adverse Events 
Most subjects in study 0761-010 experienced at least 1 treatment-related TEAEs with a lower incidence in the 
mogamulizumab group (84.8%) than in the vorinostat group (95.7%; Table 42). During the crossover portion 
of study, 57.4% of subjects had treatment-related TEAEs. 
During the randomized treatment period, the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs in the 
mogamulizumab group (with a ≥15% higher incidence compared to vorinostat) were infusion-related reaction 
(33.2% vs. 0.5%) and drug eruption (22.8% vs. 0.5%). 
Treatment-related Grade 3 TEAEs reported in more than 1 subject were drug eruption (8 [4.3%] subjects), 
hypertension (5 [2.7%] subjects), infusion-related reaction and pneumonia (3 [1.6%] each), and fatigue, AST

increased, and cellulitis (2 [1.1%] subjects each). The only treatment-related Grade 4 TEAE reported in more 
than 1 subject was respiratory failure (2 [1.1%] subjects). 
In the vorinostat group, the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs (with a ≥ 15% greater incidence 
compared to mogamulizumab) were diarrhoea (10.3% in the mogamulizumab group vs. 55.4% in the vorinostat 
group), nausea (9.2% vs. 38.2%), fatigue (8.5% vs. 33.3%), dysgeusia (3.3% vs. 28.0%), blood creatinine 
increased (0.5% vs. 24.2%), thrombocytopenia (7.6% vs. 30.1%), and decreased appetite (2.7% vs. 21.5%). 
Table 43. Treatment-related TEAEs Reported by ≥5% of Subjects in Either Treatment Group During 
Randomized Treatment (Safety Analysis Set Study 0761-010). 
For those subjects who crossed over to treatment with mogamulizumab, the most frequently reported 
treatment-related TEAEs were infusion-related reaction (36.8%) and drug eruption (22.85). 
During the crossover portion of study, 57.4% of subjects had treatment-related TEAEs of maximum Grade 1 or 
2 severity; 15.4% had treatment-related TEAEs of maximum Grade 3 severity. 
Adverse Events by Time of Onset 
An analysis for the time to onset of TEAEs was provided for the pooled safety data for patients with CTCL, with 
time intervals of 4 weeks (i.e. TEAEs occurring ≤4 weeks, >4 weeks and ≤8 weeks, or >8 weeks of treatment) 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 94/115 
  
  
 
and 24 weeks (i.e. TEAEs occurring ≤24, >24 to ≤48, and >48 weeks of treatment). The number subjects 
patients with long term treatment were 102 for >24 weeks and 51 for >48 weeks. 
For the majority of subjects with CTCL, the onset of any TEAE and any treatment related TEAE occurred in the 
first ≤4 weeks of treatment with mogamulizumab (88.4% [overall] and 65.2% [treatment related]). This trend 
was primarily driven by the TEAE of infusion-related reaction, which was the most common TEAE occurring in the 
first ≤4 weeks. The type of TEAE occurring early or late was different, with the majority of infusion-related 
reactions and pyrexia occurring within the first weeks of treatment (<4 weeks), while infections and infestations 
and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders also occurred later on (>8 weeks). 
In the analysis of TEAE onset by time intervals of 24 weeks, the onset of any TEAE and any treatment-related 
TEAE occurred in the first ≤24 weeks of treatment with mogamulizumab for approximately half of the subjects 
with CTCL (52.8% [overall] and 52.8% [treatment-related]). Similar proportions of subjects with CTCL 
experienced the onset of any TEAE and any treatment-related TEAE between >24 to ≤48 weeks (24.5% 
[overall] and 19.3% [treatment-related]), and after >48 weeks (20.2% [overall] and 12.0% 
[treatment-related]). 
Adverse Events of special interest 
Eight TEAEs were identified as categories of special interest because they were either known to be associated 
with mogamulizumab’s mechanism of action or were selected from review of the post-marketing experience in 
Japan. TEAEs of special interest include: infusion-related reactions; infections; rash, tumour lysis syndrome; 
stress cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome; severe cutaneous reactions; 
immune-related AEs; and GVHD. 
Infusion-related reaction (IRR; PT) was the most frequently reported TEAE and treatment-related TEAE in the 
mogamulizumab group (TEAE all grades: 33.2%, grade ≥3: 1.6%, SAE: 1.6%). The incidence of IRRs was 
highest after the first infusion (28.8% of subjects), reducing to ≤3.8% of subjects after 2 or more infusions. In 
the randomisation part of the study there were no cases of infusion-related reactions that led to discontinuation 
of treatment. After crossover the incidence of treatment-related IRR was 36.8% (grade ≥3:4.4%, SAE: 2.9%) 
with 4 (2.9%) subjects discontinuing treatment due to IRR (2 SAE, 2 non-serious AE). Infusion-related reaction 
is considered as an identified risk associated with the use of mogamulizumab. 
Infections were reported at a higher frequency in the mogamulizumab group in Study 0761-010 (all grades: 
64.1%, grade ≥3: 17.4%, SAE: 24.7%) compared to the vorinostat group (all grades: 50.0%, grade ≥3: 
10.2%, SAE: 10.8%). A total of 9 (4.9%) subjects in the mogamulizumab group had treatment-emergent 
infections (regardless of relationship) that led to discontinuation. Exposure-adjusted analyses revealed a lower 
exposure-adjusted incidence rate in the mogamulizumab group (0.058 events per patient-months of exposure) 
compared to the vorinostat group (0.091 events per patient months of exposure). 
The most frequently reported infections were upper respiratory tract infection and cough (10.3% and 9.8% of 
subjects in the mogamulizumab group). Grade ≥3 Infections and infestations in the mogamulizumab group 
include pneumonia (n=4), sepsis (n=3; 1 Grade 5), bacteraemia (n=2), herpes simplex (n=2), osteomyolitis 
(n=2). All other events occurred in 1 subject each. The incidence of infection was highest after >8 weeks 
(37.5%), compared to the first ≤4 weeks (17.9%) or >4 to ≤8 weeks (10.3%) of exposure in the 
mogamulizumab group. Infection is considered as an identified risk associated with the use of mogamulizumab. 
Drug eruption was the most frequent AE leading to discontinuation of treatment (13 subjects, 7.1%). In the 
mogamulizumab arm the incidence of drug eruption was 23.9% (all grades, grade≥ 3: 4.3%, SAE: 1.1%). The 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 95/115 
  
  
highest incidence was observed after >8 weeks (16.3%). Rash (drug eruption) is considered as an identified risk 
associated with the use of mogamulizumab. 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) was recorded for 2 subjects in the mogamulizumab group (one Grade 3 and one 
Grade 1 event) (incidence 1.1%). The incidence of TLS (PT) was 0.9% of all subjects with CTCL, 2.5% of 
subjects with T-cell lymphomas other than CTCL, and 1.5% of all subjects. The majority of these events were 
considered related to treatment with mogamulizumab. TLS is considered to be a potential risk associated with 
the use of mogamulizumab. 
Cardiac disorders (Stress cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome) were reported 
during treatment with mogamulizumab. Across all studies, 1 (0.3%) subject (with PTCL) experienced stress 
cardiomyopathy (PT) and 2 (0.5%) subjects  (1 subject with CTCL and 1 subject with ATL) experienced acute 
myocardial infarction (PT). Stress cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome are 
considered as potential risks associated with the use of mogamulizumab. 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions were recorded the post authorisation safety analyses (estimated 3700 
patients, mostly non-CTCL), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (15), toxic epidermal necrolysis (11), and 
dermatitis exfoliative (n=9). In all clinical studies with subjects with T-cell lymphomas (n=391), most events in 
the category of severe cutaneous adverse reactions were considered not related to treatment and were Grade 1 
or 2 in severity. Three subjects had Grade 3 events (mouth ulceration, toxic skin eruption, and Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome reported for 1 subject each). There were no Grade 4 or 5 events. There were no reports of toxic 
epidermal necrolysis. Severe cutaneous reactions are considered as potential risks associated with the use of 
mogamulizumab. 
Graft versus host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic HSCT: Recent publications have suggested that 
mogamulizumab treatment prior to HSCT in ATL patients is associated with poor transplant outcomes, 
specifically the risk of more severe or treatment-refractory acute GVHD seems to be increased in 
mogamulizumab treated patients, particular when the interval from the last mogamulizumab administration and 
performance of allo-HSCT is short (roughly less than 3 months). As subjects with a history of allo-HSCT were 
excluded from the clinical studies with mogamulizumab (except study KW-0761-001) and allo-HSCT was not 
included as a treatment option, only a few CTCL patients underwent allo-HSCT after mogamulizumab treatment. 
Follow up of all Western patients treated with mogamulizumab for hematologic malignancies who went on to 
receive HSCT identified 35 subjects who were reported to have gone onto transplant. As of 20 Jul 2017, 32 
completed surveys were received, 24 CTCL subjects and 8 non-CTCL subjects (6 ATL and 2 PTCL). Of these 10 
CTCL subjects and 2 non-CTCL subjects developed acute GVHD. The overall median time from last 
mogamulizumab dose to transplant was >200 days. Increased severity of GVHD, including post-HSCT NCTL 
subjects, is considered as a potential risk associated with the use of mogamulizumab. 
Dermatologic reactions 
Patients receiving POTELIGEO have experienced drug rash (drug eruption), some of which were severe and/or 
serious. The majority of treatment-related dermatologic reactions were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade ≥3 drug rash 
occurring in 4.3% of patients. No trend in latency to event onset was identified for drug eruptions and rashes; 
both early and late-onset events occurred. 
Infusion-related reactions  
Infusion-related reactions have been observed in 33% of patients treated with POTELIGEO. The majority of 
treatment-related infusion-related reactions were Grade 1 or 2 and occurred during or shortly after the first 
infusion. Severe reactions (Grade 3) were experienced by 4% of patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 96/115 
  
  
The incidence of infusion related reactions was highest after the first infusion (28.8% of subjects), reducing to 
≤ 3.8% of subjects after two or more infusions. Infusion interruptions occurred in approximately 6% of patients, 
most of which (approximately 90%) occurred within the first cycle of treatment with mogamulizumab. Less than 
1% of patients treated in Study 0761-010 discontinued treatment due to infusion-related reactions. 
Serious infections 
Patients with MF or SS are at increased risk of serious infection due to the disruption of dermal integrity caused 
by cutaneous disease, as well as the immunosuppressive effects of extracutaneous disease, and treatment with 
mogamulizumab may increase that risk. Serious infections, including sepsis, pneumonia and skin infections, 
were experienced by 14.3% of subjects receiving mogamulizumab. The latency to event onset following the first 
dose varied considerably. The majority of patients recovered from infection. In the clinical trial (0761-010), 
there were 2 reports of respiratory failure with fatal outcome in patients with severe pneumonia occurring more 
than 9 months after starting treatment with mogamulizumab. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
During the randomized treatment period, 37.5% of subjects in the mogamulizumab group (16.3% in SOC) and 
24.7% of subjects in the vorinostat group experienced SAEs including deaths. With the highest frequency noted 
in the SOC infections and infestations (16.3% mogamulizumab group vs 10.8% in vorinostat group). Of the 320 
subjects exposed to mogamulizumab in Study 0761-010, 21 (6.6%), experienced at least one serious adverse 
drug reaction (SADR) that occurred within 90 days from the date of last study drug administration. 
In the mogamulizumab group, the most frequently reported SAEs were pyrexia (4.3% vs. 0.5% in the vorinostat 
group), cellulitis (2.7% vs. 3.2%), pneumonia (2.2% vs. 1.1%), and disease progression (2.2% vs. 0.5%). In 
the vorinostat group, the most frequently reported SAEs were cellulitis, pulmonary embolism (0% 
mogamulizumab vs. 3.2% vorinostat), and sepsis (1.6% vs. 2.7%).  
During the crossover portion of study 10.3% (n=14) of the subjects experienced SAEs. The SAEs reported in ≥2 
subjects were cellulitis (n=2), pyrexia (n=2) and infusion related reaction (n=4). 
It should be noted that there was inconsistent reporting of disease progression as a TEAE (instead of only as an 
efficacy variable). 
Related SAEs 
Treatment related SAEs were reported for 19.6% of patients in the mogamulizumab group and 16.1% in the 
vorinostat group. In the mogamulizumab group, treatment-related SAEs included pneumonia (2.2%), pyrexia 
(2.2%), cellulitis (1.6%), and infusion-related reaction (1.6%). All other treatment-related SAEs were reported 
by ≤2 subjects each. One subject in the mogamulizumab group experienced an SAE of acute myocardial 
infarction (Grade 3) from which the subject recovered. 
During the cross-over portion of study, treatment-related SAEs were reported for 14 (10.3%) of 136 subjects, 
including 4 (2.9%) subjects with infusion-related reactions and 2 (1.5%) subjects with cellulitis. One subject 
experienced an SAE of acute myocardial infarction (Grade 3) during the crossover period from which the subject 
recovered.

Deaths 
During the randomized treatment period of study 0761-010, the incidence of TEAEs that led to death was 1.6% 
(3 subjects) in the mogamulizumab group and 4.8% (9 subjects) in the vorinostat group. During cross-over, 4 
(2.9%) subjects experienced TEAEs leading to death.  
The incidence of subjects with TEAEs leading to death reported for mogamulizumab group in Study 0761-010 
lower than for all subjects with CTCL (3.0%; 7 subjects), and the highest in subjects with T-cell lymphomas 
other than CTCL (8.9%; 14 subjects). In the overall safety population the incidence of TEAEs leading to death 
was 5.4% (21 subjects) for all subjects. Other than disease progression, TEAEs leading to death in more than 2 
subjects in the Safety population were pneumonia (4 subjects) and respiratory failure (3 subjects).  
Table 44. Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Leading to Death (Safety Population). 
The review of the updated safety data (01 Sep 2017) on SAEs and AEs leading to death across study 0761-010 
and pooled CTCL and other lymphoma studies does not impact the benefit risk of the use of the mogamulizumab 
in the CTCL patient population.

Laboratory findings 
Shift tables in CTCAE grade from baseline to the worst post-baseline toxicity grade (Grade≤2 vs Grades≥3) were 
presented by treatment group for selected haematology and chemistry parameters. During the randomized 
treatment period in Study 0761-010, 44.0% of subjects in the mogamulizumab group had shifts in lymphocytes 
(decreased) from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grades ≥3 post-baseline compared to 10.3% of subjects in the 
vorinostat group.  
For other haematology parameters, the percentages of subjects with shifts from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grades 
≥3 post-baseline were similar or lower in the mogamulizumab group (≤1.6% of subjects) compared to the 
vorinostat group (≤7.6% of subjects).  
The frequency of shifts in CTCAE grade in serum chemistry parameters (albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, 
AST, total bilirubin, creatinine, glucose, magnesium, and phosphorus), from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade ≥3 
(based on highest grade observed) was low (< 10% of patients) in both treatment groups and generally similar 
or lower in the mogamulizumab group compared to the vorinostat group, except for  a shifts to Grade ≥3 
elevations in serum glucose (non-fasting), which was twice as frequent in the vorinostat group as in the 
mogamulizumab group. 
The frequencies of abnormal haematology and serum chemistry values reported as TEAE are similar between 
the treatment arms, except for lymphocyte counts which were more often decreased in the mogamulizumab 
treated patients. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the target subset of lymphocytes specifically expected to 
be reduced by the treatment with mogamulizumab were CD26- and CD7- populations of CD4+ cells. The median 
time to first reduction of lymphocytes was approximately 4 weeks (29 days; minimum 26 days and maximum 
283 days). In these patients, the mean duration of exposure was 1.1 months and 8.6 months before and after 
experiencing lymphocyte reduction, respectively, whereas in 25 patients who did not experience lymphocyte 
reduction the mean duration of exposure was 2.5 months. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety in MF and SS populations 
The overall incidence of TEAEs was similar between subjects with MF (95.5%) and SS (100.0%). The proportion 
of subjects with the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥10% of subjects with CTCL) were similar between 
subjects by baseline CTCL diagnosis (see Table 44). 
The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs was higher in subjects with SS (91.8%) than in subjects with MF 
(78.4%). Similarly, the incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was higher in subjects with SS (41.8%) than in 
subjects with MF (30.6%). This difference was in part due to higher incidences of treatment-emergent SAEs in 
subjects with SS for cellulitis and pneumonia (5.1% each [vs. 0% each in subjects with MF]), and pyrexia (5.1% 
[vs. 2.2%]). 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the incidences of TEAEs leading to death or TEAEs leading 
to treatment discontinuation for subjects by baseline diagnosis status.

Table 45 TEAE reported for ≥10% of all Subjects with CTCL by Baseline Diagnosis Status (MF or SS) 
– All Subjects with CTCL (Safety Population) 
Some differences in safety profile between the MF stage I/II, MF stage III/IV, and SS patient subcategories were 
observed: in particular, an increased incidence of some infections (mainly cellulitis and pneumonia), 
drug-related thrombocytopenia, and increased incidence of ALT increased and AST increased in patients with SS 
compared to the MF subtypes. It is agreed with the applicant that the longer exposure to treatment in the 
SS/stage III-IV populations, as well as the higher proportion of elderly and more severe disease in the SS 
subpopulation might have confounded safety subgroup analyses. It is reassuring that exposure adjusted 
frequencies showed smaller differences for most AEs between the disease subcategories. 
Age 
In study 0761-010, among subjects randomized to receive mogamulizumab, the incidence of TEAEs associated 
with the Infections and Infestations SOC was higher among subjects <65 years of age (37.0%) than those ≥65 
years (27.2%). The incidence of diarrhoea was somewhat higher among subjects <65 years old (14.7%) 
compared to those ≥65 years (8.7%). There were no other marked differences in incidence of TEAEs by SOC or 
preferred terms. The incidence of drug eruption (9.8% and 14.1%, respectively) and infusion-related (16.3% 
and 16.8%, respectively) were similar for the two age groups. 
In the pooled safety population (all studies), the overall incidence of TEAEs was similar between subjects <65 
years old (97.3%) and ≥65 years old (98.9%). Some AEs occurred more frequent in the older patients, for 
example, in patients randomized to and treated with mogamulizumab, serious AEs (38.3% vs 35.4%), AEs 
leading to drop-out (16% vs 12.1%), the SOC Cardiac disorders (13.6% vs 4%), vascular disorders (16% vs 
14.1%), sum of postural hypotension, falls, blackouts, syncope, dizziness, ataxia, fractures (22.2% vs 14.1%) 
and some of the AEs of special interest such as infusion related reactions (72.8% vs 65.7%), rash (33.3% vs 
22.2%), tumour lysis syndrome (21% vs 13.1%), cardiac AEs of special interest (i.e. cardiomyopathy, 
myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome) (18.5% vs 5.1%), and severe cutaneous reactions (13.6% vs 
7.1%). However, for most of these AEs the same trend is observed, not only in the cross-over patients, but also 
in the vorinostat group.

Gender 
There were 223 male subjects and 176 female subjects in the overall Safety population. The overall incidence of 
TEAEs was similar between male subjects (97.3%) and female subjects (98.9%). Differences in the frequency of 
TEAEs between the genders were in the following PT: infusion related reactions, pyrexia, fatigue and chills

occurred more often in females than males (40% vs 29%, 31 vs 23%, 20 vs 14%, 17 vs 11% respectively), 
while drug eruption seems more common among males (22 vs 15%). 
In Study 0761-010, the overall incidence of TEAEs was higher among male subjects (56.5%) than among female 
subjects (40.8%) receiving mogamulizumab. Differences in incidence of TEAEs by SOC and/or individual 
preferred terms were observed in Gastrointestinal Disorders (males, 29.9%; females, 20.7%); Infections and 
Infestations (males, 37.0%; females, 27.2%); Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (males, 32.1%; 
females, 20.7%); Drug eruption (males, 14.7%; females, 9.2%); Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal (males, 
17.9%; females, 12.5%). Infusion-related reactions occurred with similar frequency in males (15.8%) and 
females (17.4%). 
Race 
The overall incidence of TEAEs was similar between subjects who were White (97.8%), Asian (100%), 
Black/African American (96.3%), or whose race was reported as Other (91.7%). Any observed differences were 
likely due to different study designs (i.e., inpatient monitoring, protocol-defined reporting of laboratory AEs, and 
protocol-defined assessments of infusion-related reactions; and protocol-mandated reporting of rashes as drug 
eruptions) of the studies in Japan. Due to the small number of subjects who were Black/African American (n=54) 
compared to subjects who were White (n=185), Asian (n=94), or Other (n=12), no meaningful conclusions can 
be made from these differences. 
ECOG performance status 
The majority of subjects had a baseline ECOG PS of 0 (213 subjects) or 1 (134 subjects); 43 subjects had a 
baseline ECOG PS of 2. Overall, the incidence of subjects with TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs was similar 
between these groups. Treatment-emergent SAEs were more frequently reported in subjects with an ECOG PS 
of 2 (67.4%) than in subjects with an ECOG PS of 1 (41.8%) or 0 (26.3%), as were TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation (27.9% vs. 20.9% vs. 11.3%, respectively), and TEAEs leading to death (27.9% vs. 3.7% vs. 
1.9%). 
Other subpopulations 
Geographic locations: The geographic regions of the US (164[41.1%] subjects), Europe (121 [30.3%]), and the 
Rest of World (Japan, Australia, SA, and Caribbean; 106 [26.6%] were compared. Analysis by these geographic 
regions showed that no conclusions can be drawn based on the small numbers of subjects and reports of TEAEs. 
The Applicant has not discussed the impact of renal impairment, hepatic impairment or CCR4 expression level on 
the safety profile of mogamulizumab.  
The effect of ADA on safety was analysed from the pooled immunogenicity database of Study 0761-007, 
0761-009, and 0761-010, that were similar for dose and dosing regimen and immunogenicity testing 
methodology, including the bioanalytical method used for measuring anti-mogamulizumab and neutralising 
antibody.  
The overall percentage of samples with a status of “ADA-inconclusive” was 37.6% (790 of 2100 samples) 
because the concentration of mogamulizumab in the test sample exceeded the DLT for the neutralising assay.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No adverse events due to interactions were noted.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In pivotal Study 0761-010, 157 of the 184 subjects in the mogamulizumab group, 176 of the 186 vorinostat 
group (of which 136 subjects crossed over) and 105 of the 136 subjects in the cross-over group had 
discontinued treatment. The most frequent reasons for discontinuation were disease progression and 
AEs/intolerance of treatment. Discontinuation due to AE was reported for TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
treatment occurred in 35 (19.0%) of subjects in the mogamulizumab group and 43 (23.1%) in the vorinostat 
group. For subjects randomized to mogamulizumab, the percentage  of subjects discontinuing randomized 
therapy due to disease progression was slightly higher for subjects with the MF subtype compared to the SS 
Subtype (60/105 [57.2%] vs 38/81 [46.9%], respectively) and for subjects with stage IB/II compared to stage 
III/IV CTCL (40/68 [58.9%] vs 58/118 [49.2%], respectively). The number of subjects discontinuing due to 
adverse events was lower in subjects with the MF subtype compared to the SS Subtype (13/105 [12.4%] vs 
15/81 [18.5%], respectively) and in subjects with stage IB/II compared to stage III/IV CTCL (8/68 [11.8%] vs 
20/118 [16.9%], respectively). In contrast, in the control arm, the mean exposure was greater for subjects with 
MF than SS, and greater for subjects with stage IB/II compared to stage III/IV. 
In the mogamulizumab group, drug eruption was the most frequent AE leading to discontinuation of treatment 
(13 subjects, 7.1%). In the vorinostat group, the most frequent AEs leading to discontinuation were fatigue 
(4.3%), diarrhoea (2.7%), and thrombocytopenia (2.7%). 
During the crossover portion of study, treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported for 23 
(16.9%) of 136 subjects, including 12 (8.8%) subjects with drug eruptions and 4 (2.9%) with infusion-related 
reactions.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database of mogamulizumab, administered as monotherapy is comprised of 7 clinical studies in 
patients with T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, PTCL, and ATL). The pivotal randomised controlled Phase 3 study 
0761-010 is the main study used for safety assessment as it accounts for 79% of the total CTCL population 
exposed to mogamulizumab, supplemented by safety data from the other studies. 
At the time of cut-off date for study 0761-010 (31 Dec 2016), the median number of 28 day-cycles during the 
randomized treatment period was 6 in the mogamulizumab arm (170 days), and 3 in the vorinostat arm (84 
days). The median relative dose intensity was 97.49% for mogamulizumab, and 95.12% for vorinostat.  
A difference in exposure between the disease subtypes and disease stages is seen in the mogamulizumab arm, 
with longer exposure time in subjects with more advanced/severe disease . Also the reasons for discontinuation 
seem to be different between subjects with less and more advanced/severe disease. In the less 
advanced/severe disease population discontinuations were more often due to disease progression, while in 
advanced disease population adverse events were more commonly noted as reason for discontinuation. These 
differences in exposure and discontinuation may suggests that in particular subjects with more advanced/severe 
disease experience a beneficial effect of mogamulizumab treatment, which is in line with the conclusion on 
efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 103/115 
  
  
During the randomized treatment period in Study 0761-010, almost all patients experienced at least one TEAE: 
97.3% in the mogamulizumab arm and 99.5% in the vorinostat arm. While the incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was 
similar between the two treatment groups (42.4% vs 45.7%), a higher incidence of SAEs including deaths was 
seen in the mogamulizumab group (37.5% vs 24.7%). The incidence of TEAEs that led to death was 1.6% (3 
subjects) in the mogamulizumab group and 4.8% (9 subjects) in the vorinostat group. 
The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs and treatment-related grade ≥3 TEAE was lower for mogamulizumab 
(84.8%, and 25.5%) compared to vorinostat (95.7% and 34.9%). As this is an open label study, this might 
reflect the physicians perception of the safety of mogamulizumab vs vorinostat rather than a real difference in 
treatment-attributable TEAEs.  
The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, pyrexia, infusion related reaction and 
cellulitis. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were infusion-related reaction and rash (drug 
eruption); most of these reactions were non-serious and Grades 1 or 2.  
Severe adverse reactions included Grade 4 respiratory failure (1.1%) and Grade 5 reactions were polymyositis 
and sepsis (0.5% each). 
No major differences are noted between the profile of treatment-related TEAEs or SAEs compared to that of all 
TEAEs and SAEs irrespective of causality. 
The reporting of the effects of laboratory analysis consisted only of an analysis of shifts in laboratory 
parameters. In this analysis a shift to ≥ grade 3 lymphocyte decreased was more frequently noted in 
mogamulizumab treated patients (44% vs 10.3%). Similarly, neutropenia and neutrophil count decrease were 
also considered related to treatment in some cases (2.7% and 1.6%, respectively), and are included in table of 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
More frequent TEAEs (by SOC or PT) in the vorinostat group included GI symptoms (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting 
constipation), constitutional symptoms (fatigue, asthenia), thrombocytopenia and taste disorders (dysgeusia, 
dry mouth) and correspond to the most common adverse reactions described in the (FDA) label of vorinostat. 
The majority of subjects experienced a TEAE early during treatment, the frequency of late onset TEAE was 
lower, but still occurred regularly, in approximately 25% of the subjects treated for longer duration. Of note the 
number of subjects with long term treatment is rather limited (n=102 for > 24 weeks and n=51 for >48 weeks). 
The majority of infusion-related reactions and pyrexia occurred within the first weeks of treatment (<4 weeks), 
while infections and infestations and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders also occurred later on (>8 weeks).  
Acute infusion-related reactions (IRRs) have been observed in patients treated with mogamulizumab. The IRRs 
were mostly mild or moderate in severity, although there have been a few reports of severe reactions (Grade 3). 
The majority of IRRs occur during or shortly after the first infusion (all within 24 hours of administration), with 
the incidence decreasing over subsequent treatments. During the first month of treatment a higher frequency of 
TLS-related events is apparent, therefore routine monitoring of clinical laboratory parameters, including renal 
function test and electrolytes, for all patients at least during this time frame are recommended (see SmPC 
section 4.4).  
The number of subjects with a TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment were 35 (19.0%) in the 
mogamulizumab group and 43 (23.1%) in the vorinostat group. For a substantial number of subjects (35%) a 
dose of mogamulizumab was withheld or not administered. The AEs recorded as reason for withholding a dose 
(drug eruption, thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased/neutropenia, infusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 104/115 
  
  
related reaction) are among the most commonly observed AEs. Notably, drug eruption was the most frequent AE 
leading to discontinuation of treatment.  
When mogamulizumab has been administered to patients with T-cell lymphomas other than MF or SS, serious 
skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been 
reported in less than 1% of patients during clinical trials, and also reported during the post-marketing period; 
some of these cases were reported with fatal outcomes. Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms or 
signs that suggest SJS or TEN. If they occur, mogamulizumab should be interrupted and treatment should not 
restart unless SJS or TEN is ruled out and cutaneous reaction has resolved to Grade 1 or less. If SJS/TEN occur, 
appropriate medical therapy should be administered. (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Subjects with MF or SS treated with mogamulizumab are at increased risk of serious infection and/or viral 
reactivation. The combination of mogamulizumab with systemic immune modulating medicinal products or with 
other licensed therapies for MF or SS has not been studied and is, therefore, not recommended, especially in 
consideration of the risk of severe infections in patients treated with mogamulizumab. Topical steroids or low 
doses of systemic corticosteroids may be used during treatment with mogamulizumab; however, the risk of 
serious infection and/or viral reactivation may be higher in case of concomitant administration with systemic 
immunosuppressive agents. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated 
promptly. 
Patients should be tested for hepatitis B infection before initiating treatment with mogamulizumab. For patients 
who test positive for current/previous hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the 
treatment of hepatitis B is recommended for advice concerning appropriate measures against hepatitis B 
reactivation (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Complications, including severe graft versus host disease (GVHD), have been reported in patients with T-cell 
lymphomas other than MF or SS who received allogeneic HSCT after mogamulizumab.  
A higher risk of transplant complications has been reported if mogamulizumab is given within a short time frame 
(approximately 50 days) before HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related 
complications. The safety of treatment with mogamulizumab after autologous or allogeneic HSCT has not been 
studied. 
Increased severity of GVHD, including post-HSCT NCTL subjects, is considered as a potential risk associated with 
the use of mogamulizumab. A post-Authorisation Safety Study to Characterise the Safety of Allogeneic 
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) in Patients with Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) treated 
with Mogamulizumab is agreed (see RMP). 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been observed in patients receiving mogamulizumab. TLS was observed most 
frequently during the first month of treatment. Patients with rapidly proliferating tumour and high tumour 
burden are at risk of TLS. Patients should be monitored closely by appropriate laboratory and clinical tests for 
electrolyte status, hydration and renal function, particularly in the first month of treatment, and managed 
according to best medical practice. Management of TLS may include aggressive hydration, correction of 
electrolyte abnormalities, anti-hyperuricaemic therapy, and supportive care (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
One case of acute myocardial infarction has been observed in a clinical trial patient with MF / SS receiving 
mogamulizumab. In clinical trial patients with other T-cell lymphomas there have been reports of stress 
cardiomyopathy (one case) and acute myocardial infarction (one case). The subjects had a medical history 
including various risk factors. Patients who have risk factors associated with cardiac disease should be 
monitored and appropriate precautions taken (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).

The review of the updated safety data on SAEs and AEs leading to death across study 0761-010 and pooled CTCL 
and other lymphoma studies did not change the picture in the CTCL patient population.  
Further, the type and frequency of adverse events was compared between MF stage I/II, MF stage III/IV, and SS 
patients. The study population with SS had primarily advanced stage disease, and included a substantial larger 
proportion of patients ≥65 years of age compared to the MF subcategories. Some differences in safety profile 
between the three subcategories were observed: in particular, an increased incidence of some infections (mainly 
cellulitis and pneumonia), drug-related thrombocytopenia, and increased incidence of ALT increased and AST 
increased in patients with SS compared to the MF subtypes. It seems that the longer exposure to treatment in 
the SS/stage III-IV populations, as well as the higher proportion of elderly and more severe disease in the SS 
subpopulation might have confounded safety subgroup analyses. It is reassuring that exposure adjusted 
frequencies showed smaller differences for most AEs between the disease subcategories. 
AEs in the SOCs of cardiac disorders and Vascular diseases, and rash and infusion-related reactions as AEs of 
special interest occurred with a higher frequency in older (≥65 years) patients receiving mogamulizumab, but 
not in those randomized to vorinostat. However, only for rash and IRR the difference was considered indicative 
of age being a potential risk factor for the occurrence of these adverse events. This as the incidence for 
treatment related rash was 29% vs 18% for ≥ 65 years and < 65 years, respectively, and for IRR (anaphylactic 
reaction, CRS) was 60.0% vs 50.5% for ≥ 65 years and < 65 years, respectively. 
Some differences in frequency of TEAEs were noted between the genders. Overall it appears that females were 
more likely to have general disorders and administration site conditions (pyrexia/chills, pain), infusion related 
reactions, blood and lymphatic system disorders (lymphopenia, anaemia and neutropenia) and insomnia, while 
males were more prone to have skin and cutaneous disorders (drug eruption, alopecia). No gender specific AE 
was observed, and no consistent gender difference in grade 3/4 AE across the T cell lymphoma population and 
study 0761-010 population and in serious AE was noted. It was concluded that the difference in frequency 
between AE as PT is relatively small, and not clinically relevant, meaning that there is insufficient data to justify 
inclusion in the SmPC.  
Women of childbearing potential and males of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during 
treatment with POTELIGEO and for at least 6 months after treatment. 
There are no data from the use of mogamulizumab in pregnant women. Although mogamulizumab crosses the 
placental barrier in cynomolgous monkey, apart from the pharmacological effect in foetuses, animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a 
precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of mogamulizumab during pregnancy. 
It is unknown whether mogamulizumab is excreted in human milk. There is no data on the excretion of 
mogamulizumab in milk from animal studies with mogamulizumab.  In humans, during the first few days after 
birth IgG1 antibodies may be excreted in milk and through the milk transferred to newborns.  In this short 
period, a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. 
There are no clinical data available on the effect of mogamulizumab on human fertility. No specific studies in 
animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of mogamulizumab on fertility. No adverse effects on male 
and female reproductive organs were observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys (see 
section 4.6). 
As only a few subjects were considered ADA-positive, no conclusion can be drawn on the effect of ADA on the 
safety profile.

EMA/698539/2018 
Page 106/115 
  
  
The effect of differences in the % of CCR4 positive cells on the safety of mogamulizumab treatment was 
analysed. The frequency of reported AEs fluctuated across the 4 analysed subcategories with CCR4 expression 
levels between 1-90%. It is nevertheless agreed that no substantial difference in the safety profile of 
mogamulizumab in patients with different CCR4 expression levels has been observed. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of mogamulizumab has been characterised in a sufficient number of subjects. Overall, main 
risks associated with mogamulizumab treatment are infusion-related reactions, drug eruption and infections – 
which were in general mild or moderate in severity, therefore the safety profile appears to be manageable. The 
MAH should closely monitor in the PSURs the immune-related adverse events. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.4 is acceptable.  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 30.03.2012. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that mogamulizumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on a review of the available data, considers mogamulizumab to be a new active substance as 
it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, POTELIGEO (mogamulizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in 
any medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initial proposed indication was CTCL, but no data had been provided in other subtypes than MF or SS in the 
pivotal trial; the indication was later revised to include MF and SS patients.    
Further to the CHMP review, the proposed indication is ‘the treatment of mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sézary 
syndrome (SS) in adults who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. These conditions are the most 
frequently observed subsets of Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) a group of primary cutaneous lymphomas 
(PCL).  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Most CTCL subtypes are characterized by frequent recurrences. The early stages of MF and pcALCL have an 
excellent prognosis, while the advanced stages of MF have a poor prognosis. In contrast to patch/plaque MF, SS 
is much more symptomatic, has a lower potential for remission, and lower expected survival. At present, there 
are no standard therapies for patients with higher stage treatment resistant disease. Systemic options 
bexarotene and methotrexate are frequently used in second line MF (both RR 30-50%). With Sézary's syndrome 
(SS), low dose methotrexate, bexarotene, denileukin difitox, alemtuzumab (low-dose) and multi-agent 
chemotherapy have been recommended as second-line treatment. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Main evidence to support this application is obtained from pivotal Phase 3, randomized, open-label Study 
0761-010. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of mogamulizumab (n=186) versus vorinostat (n=186) 
in patients with previously treated  relapsed or refractory CTCL (~54% MF and ~45% SS). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint PFS per Investigator based on the ITT population, as reported after 241 PFS events at the 
data cut-off (31 Dec 2016), showed a statistically significant improvement for mogamulizumab compared with 
vorinostat with a HR of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.69, 2-sided p<0.0001) and a gain in median PFS of 4.6 months 
in favour of mogamulizumab (median PFS 7.7 months vs 3.1 months, respectively). 
The results of several secondary endpoints supported the primary endpoint. PFS by Independent Review as 
reported after 232 PFS events, showed a statistically significant improvement for mogamulizumab with a HR of 
0.64 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.84, 2-sided p=0.0007), and a gain in median PFS of 2.87 months (6.70 months 
mogamulizumab vs. 3.83 months vorinostat). The ORR per investigator was significantly higher for 
mogamulizumab (28%) vs. vorinostat (4.8%) in the ITT, and in all the analysed subpopulations. 
Confirmed compartmental response rates in skin, blood and lymph nodes based on investigator assessment as 
well as independent review were all significantly larger for mogamulizumab than for vorinostat in the ITT, and in 
all the analysed subpopulations. 
The median DOR was 14.07 months vs. 9.13 months, in favour of mogamulizumab; The median TTR was 3.32 
months vs. 5.10 months, in favour of mogamulizumab. A post-hoc analysis of Time to Next Treatment (TTNT) 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018 
Page 110/115 
  
  
indicated a significant increase in median TTNT for mogamulizumab compared to vorinostat in the ITT (11.00 
months; 95% CI: 8.80, 12.63 vs 3.47 months; 95% CI; 3.10, 4.27), and in all the analysed subpopulations. The 
exploratory endpoint of TTF was 5.8 months with mogamulizumab vs. 2.87 months with vorinostat.  
The median OS was 43.93 months (43.57,-) in the vorinostat arm, and not estimable for the mogamulizumab 
arm (HR=0.93, 95% CI 0.61, 1.43); however the interpretation of this result is hindered by the cross-over 
design of the trial.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no uncertainties in the favourable effects of mogamulizumab in the treatment of MF and SS.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost all patients (97.3%) experienced at least one TEAE upon mogamulizumab treatment, with 42% grade ≥
3 TEAEs, 38% of the subjects experiencing SEA, and 3 subjects (1.6%) were reported to have a TEAE that led 
to death. In the pivotal study 35 (19%) subjects randomised to mogamulizumab discontinued treatment due to 
adverse events. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were infusion related reaction and rash (drug eruption); most of 
these reactions were non serious and Grades 1 or 2. Severe adverse reactions included Grade 4 respiratory 
failure (1.1%) and Grade 5 reactions were polymyositis and sepsis (0.5% each). The most frequently reported 
serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, pyrexia, infusion related reaction and cellulitis.  
A shift to ≥ grade 3 lymphocyte decreased was more frequently noted in mogamulizumab treated patients (44% 
vs 10.3%). The reduction of lymphocytes is linked to the mechanism of action of mogamulizumab treatment. 
Flow cytometry analysis showed that the target subset of lymphocytes specifically expected to be reduced by the 
treatment with mogamulizumab were CD26- and CD7- populations of CD4+ cells.  
Infusion-related reaction, infections, and rash (drug eruption) are considered as identified risks associated with 
the use of mogamulizumab. Furthermore tumour lysis syndrome and severe cutaneous adverse reactions 
(including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) were identified as potential risks 
associated with mogamulizumab treatment. Also increased severity of GVHD upon HSCT after mogamulizumab 
treatment has been noted as a potential risk associated with the use of mogamulizumab. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
As subjects with a history of allo-HSCT were excluded from the pivotal clinical study and allo-HSCT was not 
included as a treatment option, only a few CTCL patients underwent allo-HSCT after mogamulizumab treatment. 
Increased severity of GVHD, including post-HSCT NCTL subjects, has been reported in the literature is 
considered as a potential risk associated with the use of mogamulizumab. A PASS study is agreed to characterise 
safety of HSCT- including treatment-related mortality, non-relapse mortality and cause, and incidence and 
characterization of GVHD and graft failure, in CTCL patients treated with mogamulizumab (see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The difference in median PFS of 4.6 months (HR 0.53; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.69; p<0.0001) is considered clinically 
relevant for the target population. The PFS results were supported by secondary endpoints ORR (28 vs 5%) 
+DoR (14 months) and time to next line therapy (TTNT, 11 months vs 3.5 months). The response rates of 28%

with a median DoR of 14 months in the ITT, obtained using a stringent global composite assessment, is clinically 
meaningful to the patient in terms of reduction of disease related symptoms which limit the quality of life. 
The safety profile of mogamulizumab has been characterised in a sufficient number of subjects, main risks 
associated with mogamulizumab treatment are infusion-related reactions, drug eruption and infections. As the 
majority of these events were mild or moderate in severity, the safety profile appears to be manageable.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Taken together it is considered that the outcomes of PFS, supported by the ORR+DoR, can be viewed as 
clinically relevant in the context of a relapse/remitting disease where patients continue through therapies, which 
makes this product with a new mode of action a valuable additional treatment option in MF/SS. The overall 
safety profile appears manageable. As the target population MF and SS is inherently CCR4 positive, there is no 
need to specify the molecular target in the indication.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of POTELIGEO in the treatment of MF and SS who have previously received at least one 
prior systemic therapy, is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Poteligeo is not similar to Ledaga and Adcetris within the meaning 
of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of POTELIGEO is favourable in the following indication: 
POTELIGEO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sézary syndrome (SS) 
who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, 
section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
Assessment report  
EMA/698539/2018

subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 6 
months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that mogamulizumab is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

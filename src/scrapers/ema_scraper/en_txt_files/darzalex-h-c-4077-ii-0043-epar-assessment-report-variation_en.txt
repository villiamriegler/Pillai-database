2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Systemic  AL  amyloidosis  is  a  rare  and  incurable  malignant  plasma  cell  disorder  characterised  by  clonal 
expansion of CD38+ plasma cells and an overproduction of immunoglobulin light chains that misfold into 
insoluble amyloid.  
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The  proposed  addition  to  the  existing  indication  statement  in  section  4.1  of  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) is as follows: 
“DARZALEZX is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis.” 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The epidemiology of AL amyloidosis has not been well characterised. AL amyloidosis is rare, the incidence 
is approximately 3 - 12 cases per million persons per year, and an estimated prevalence of 30 000 to 45 000 
AL amyloidosis patients in the United States and the European Union (Quock et al. 2018). There is a slight 
male predominance with nearly 60% of patients being male. The median age at diagnosis is 64 years, the 
majority of patients being over the age of 65 years and fewer than 5% of patients with AL are younger 
than 40 years (Nienhuis et al 2016, Quock et al. 2018).  
AL amyloidosis typically develops from the background of a plasma cell neoplasm but can be associated 
with  other  lymphoproliferative  disorders  in  which  there  is  excess  secretion  of  κ-or  λ-free  light  chains, 
including WM or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), as defined by CRAB 
criteria, is diagnosed simultaneously in approximately 10% of patients with AL amyloidosis. In addition, up 
to  40%  of  patients  with  AL  have  10%  or  more  bone-marrow  plasma  cells  at  diagnosis  but  do  not  meet 
CRAB criteria. Later progression to overt myeloma in patients with isolated AL amyloidosis is rare. 
Amyloidosis  has  a  poor  prognosis,  the  median  survival  without  treatment  is  13  months  from  diagnosis 
(Sanchorawala 2007, Chaulagain 2013). Cardiac involvement has the worst prognosis and results in death 
in about 6 months after onset of congestive heart failure. Only 5% of the patients with primary amyloidosis 
survive beyond 10 years. 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The  major  systemic  types  of  amyloidosis  are  AL  (associated  with  a  light  chain-producing  plasma  cell 
dyscrasia), which is the most common, AA  (associated with longstanding inflammation), wild-type ATTR 
(associated with normal transthyretin and old age), and hereditary ATTR (associated with a transthyretin 
mutation) amyloidosis. 
Light chain amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis) is caused by extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrils in tissues 
and organs. These fibrils are derived from CD38+ clonal plasma cells that secrete light chains that misfold 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021 
Page 8/119 
 
 
 
 
into insoluble amyloid. Deposition of amyloid in vital organs results in serious and life-threatening organ 
dysfunction. The spectrum of morbidity and risk of mortality are determined by the pattern and extent of 
organ involvement (Gertz 2005; Gertz 2010).  
Amyloid fibrils are identified by their characteristic appearance on electron microscopy and their affinity for 
Congo red. 
The plasma cell (PC) proliferation in AL amyloidosis is typically low-burden, with <10% PCs in over half of 
the patients. 
Serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation can identify a monoclonal protein in nearly 
90% of AL patients. Addition of the serum-free light-chain assay to the diagnostic work-up increases the 
yield to over  98%  of  the patients.  Most  patients  with  AL  amyloidosis  have little  or no intact  monoclonal 
immunoglobulin but are characterized by the presence of monoclonal-free light chain. The monoclonal light-
chain type is λ in approximately 70% of cases, κ in 25%, and biclonal in 5%. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The clinical presentation is dictated by the spectrum and severity of the organ involvement.  
Amyloidosis has a poor prognosis, depending on the number and extent of organ involvement. The median 
survival without treatment is 13 months (Sanchorawala 2007, Chaulagain 2013). Approximately one-third 
of patients die largely due to cardiac involvement within the first year of diagnosis. Cardiac involvement 
has the worst prognosis and results in death in about 6 months after onset of congestive heart failure. Only 
5%  of  the  patients  with  primary  amyloidosis  survive  beyond  10  years.  Among  patients  with  renal 
involvement,  about  one-third  progress  to  dialysis.  The  involvement  of  other  organs,  e.g.,  liver, 
gastrointestinal tract and peripheral and autonomic nerves, contributes to significant chronic morbidity and 
mortality, such that the OS rate at 2 years is only 60% (Muchtar 2017; Wechalekar 2015). Achieving less 
than a CR or VGPR in AL amyloidosis is suboptimal, as a sufficient reduction of light chains is required to 
reduce both the acute proteotoxicity of the amyloid as well as the continuous organ damage due to amyloid 
deposits. 
Though  multiple  prognostic  models  have  been  proposed  for  patients  with  amyloidosis,  models  that 
incorporate markers of cardiac damage have high predictive value for early death in AL amyloidosis. The 
revised Mayo Clinic Amyloid Staging system classifies patients as having stage I, II, III, or IV disease based 
upon the identification of zero, 1, 2, or 3 of the following risk factors: NT-pro- BNP ≥1,800 ng/L, cardiac 
troponin T ≥0.025 μg/L, and a difference between involved and uninvolved serum-free light chains ≥18 
mg/ dL. Median overall survivals from diagnosis for stages I-IV were 94, 40, 14, and 6 months, respectively. 
Management 
No  regimen  has  been  approved  for  amyloidosis  (Wechalekar  2015)  and  no  optimal  treatment  has  been 
identified (Anderson 2014, NCCN). 
As both AL amyloidosis and multiple myeloma are clonal plasma cell disorders, the treatment approach is 
to use MM regimens to achieve rapid, deep, and durable hematologic responses (Wechalekar 2015; Mayo 
SMART  Amyloidosis  guidelines,  Anderson  2014).  Eradicating  the  clonal  plasma  cell  in  AL  amyloidosis 
eliminates  the  production of  the  light  chain  that is  both  amyloidogenic  and  proteotoxic  leading  to organ 
failure. Despite this, there are key differences in the efficacy and safety between these 2 populations. The 
achievement of a rapid and deep hematologic response is the essential goal of therapy in AL amyloidosis 
and  an  indicator  for  clinical  outcome.  The  depth  of  hematologic  response  is  associated  with  organ 
improvement and survival (Palladini 2012, Kastritis 2020). Thus, the goal of therapy for patients with AL 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021 
Page 9/119 
 
 
 
 
amyloidosis  is  to  achieve  “complete  hematologic  response  (CHR)  or  at  a  minimum  very  good  partial 
response (VGPR) in order to prevent further end-organ damage, reverse existing organ dysfunction, and 
prolong OS (Chaulagain 2013, Merlini 2018). In AL amyloidosis, achieving a partial hematologic response 
or  stable  disease  may  not  offer  a  clinical  benefit,  because  ongoing  light  chain  production  may  result  in 
further organ damage. Therefore, partial response (PR) should always be viewed in conjunction with organ 
response in the evaluation of treatment outcomes (Comenzo 2012).  
The  entire  armamentarium  of  multiple  myeloma  regimens  has  been  used  in  AL  amyloidosis.  The  use  of 
cyclophosphamide+bortezomib+dexamethasone (CyBorD also referred to as VCd) is recommended by the 
NCCN,  British  Society  of  Haematology,  and  consensus  guidelines  (Comenzo  2012,  Anderson  2014; 
Mahmood  2014,  Wechalekar  2008).  It  is  the  preferred  regimen  for  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  and 
relapsed AL amyloidosis due to the limited feasibility and high mortality rate of HDM/ASCT, and the cardiac 
and renal toxicities associated with IMiDs (D’Souza 2015).  
The  overall  response  rate  (OrRR,  PR  or  better)  for  CyBorD  in  the  largest  retrospective  cohort  of  newly 
diagnosed patients with AL amyloidosis was 62% (125/201) patients with measurable disease compared 
with 100% in newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma, and with HemCR in 42 subjects (21%) and 
VGPR in 45 (22%). Cardiac response was achieved in 17% of patients, while renal response was observed 
in  25%  of  patients  (Kumar  2012;  Palladini  2015).  High-dose  melphalan  and  ASCT  demonstrate  a  high 
efficacy profile; however, only a minority of patients are candidates (~20%) and it is associated with much 
higher treatment-related mortality than in multiple myeloma (5% to 24%, compared with 1%) (Jaccard 
2007; D’Souza 2015). In long-term data on 701 patients evaluated at the Boston Amyloidosis Center of 
whom  394  (56%)  were  deemed  eligible  for  transplant  and  312  patients  were  treated  with  HDM/ASCT 
(Skinner 2004), the CHR rate was 40% and the transplant-related mortality was 13%. The organ response 
rate at 1-year post-transplant among those who achieved a CHR was 27% for cardiac and 63% for renal 
(NCCN 2019). 
Thalidomide and lenalidomide-based regimens are associated with severe toxicities including bradycardia, 
syncope, and renal failure (Merlini 2018). Carfilzomib is known to be associated with severe cardiac toxicity 
in  multiple  myeloma  and  is  prohibitively  toxic  in  AL  amyloidosis  (Waxman  2018;  Cohen  2016). 
Lenalidomide-containing regimens have been used in AL amyloidosis with similar results as thalidomide-
containing regimens. The overall hematologic response rate for lenalidomide-based regimens has been 46% 
with  a  CHR  of  25%  (Cibeira  2015).  Although  lenalidomide  is  associated  with  lower  rates  of  peripheral 
neuropathy than thalidomide, it is also a challenging drug in AL amyloidosis. 
Although CyBorD is currently considered the standard of care, certain subgroups like cardiac Stage III, high 
dFLC (>180 mg/L), and t(11;14) continue to have dismal outcomes (Dispenzieri 2018; Palladini 2018).  
In conclusion, the MM regimens demonstrate similar or lower hematologic responses in AL amyloidosis but 
are associated with higher rates of toxicity. Thus, a substantial unmet medical need exists for therapies in 
AL amyloidosis, that can provide clinical efficacy translating into survival benefits at a lower toxicity. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Daratumumab  is  a  human  CD38-targeted,  IgG1  kappa  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  that  binds  with  high 
affinity to a unique epitope on cluster of differentiation (CD) 38, a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed 
on the cell surface of a variety of hematologic malignancies. It is a targeted immunotherapy directed toward 
tumor cells that express high levels of CD38, such as the clonal plasma cells in multiple   myeloma.     
Multiple  mechanisms  of  action  have  been  observed  for  daratumumab,  including  complement  dependent 
cytotoxicity,  ADCC,  ADCP,  and  induction  of  apoptosis  by  Fc  gamma  receptor-mediated  crosslinking  of 
tumor-bound  mAbs.  Complement  dependent  cytotoxicity  occurs  rapidly  and  maximal  cell  killing  by 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021 
Page 10/119 
 
 
 
 
daratumumab is demonstrated within 1 hour of antibody mediated activation of the complement proteins 
ex vivo. Daratumumab induced ADCC is slower in its action in vitro (de Weers 2011), and daratumumab 
has also been shown to induce ADCP in the presence of macrophages (Overdijk 2012; Overdijk 2015).  
Daratumumab leads to the rapid and sustained elimination of highly immunosuppressive subsets of CD38+ 
Tregs,  CD38+  MDSCs,  and  CD38+  regulatory  B  cells  (Chiu  2016).  The  elimination  of  these 
immunosuppressive  cells,  modulation  of  CD38  enzymatic  activity,  and  destruction  of  the  malignant 
myeloma cells is thought to lead to the clonal expansion of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Chiu 2016; Van De 
Donk  2017).  Altogether,  daratumumab’s  converging  mechanisms  of  action  are  hypothesized  to 
synergistically lead to the responses observed in patients with clonal plasma cell disorders, regardless of 
setting. 
Recently, the daratumumab SC formulation was approved in the US and EU. The SC formulation reduces 
the  incidence  of  IRRs  and  the  risk  for  volume  overload  that  may  be  anticipated  in  patients  with  AL 
amyloidosis with cardiac and renal involvement.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The current submission of daratumumab for the treatment of subjects with AL amyloidosis is based on data 
from the Phase 3 study, AMY3001, comparing daratumumab SC 1800 mg administered in combination with 
VCd to VCd alone.  
Daratumumab  IV  received  an  initial  marketing  authorization  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (US: November 2015; EU: May 2016). Since the initial marketing 
authorisation, several indications have been approved for multiple myeloma in both the relapsed/refractory 
and newly diagnosed settings. More recently, the SC formulation of DARZALEX has been approved, and is 
currently pending approval in other countries. 
During  the  design  and  conduct  of  Study  AMY3001,  the  MAH  sought  advice  from  Regulatory  Authorities 
(Table 1).

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
The MAH states, that the studies included in this submission were conducted and reported in accordance 
with the ethical principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with ICH GCP 
guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and in compliance with the protocol. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody and is consequently classified as a protein. According to 
the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides and proteins are exempted because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Consequently, no Environmental Risk 
Assessment for daratumumab is required. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK analyses in Study AMY3001 were based on the serum concentration of daratumumab in samples 
collected  from  subjects  in  the  Safety  Run-in  Phase  and  in  the  daratumumab  SC+CyBorD  arm  in  the 
randomized  phase  of  the  study.  Serum  daratumumab  concentrations  at  planned  timepoints  were 
summarized using descriptive statistics.

Bioanalysis 
Validated  electro  chemiluminescent  immunoassay  (ECLIA)-based  methods  were  used  to  determine 
daratumumab concentrations and anti-daratumumab antibodies in human serum samples. In addition to a 
previous less drug tolerant ADA method, a newer enhanced drug tolerant PandA ECLIA method was used 
for detection of anti-daratumumab antibodies in human serum. For NAbs a validated target tolerant cell-
based binding assay was available. For Study AMY3001, no ADA-positive subjects were detected; therefore, 
this NAb assay was not applied.  
Daratumumab SC is a co-formulation of daratumumab and rHuPH20. A validated ECLIA method was used 
for assessment of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in human plasma after SC administration. A validated in vitro 
hyaluronidase  activity  assay  with  a  chromogenic  readout  was  used  to  test  for  neutralising  capacity. 
Interference testing of JNJ-64007957 was performed. JNJ-64007957 is a bi-specific IgG antibody, which is 
not used in Study AMY3001.  
In  Study  AMY3001,  daratumumab  is  given  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide,  bortezomib  and 
dexamethasone.  No  assay  interference  is  expected  since  these  small  molecules  do  not  bind  to  assay 
reagents nor to CD38. Interference by light chains were not evaluated. A parallelism study showed that AL 
amyloidosis matrix could be diluted without influence on daratumumab quantification. 
Population PK analysis 
Serum daratumumab concentration-time data from Phase 3 Study AMY3001 were used for nonlinear mixed-
effects  modelling  using  NONMEM  (Version  7.4)  and  the  first-order  conditional  method  with  interaction 
(FOCEI). R (Version 3.6.0 or higher) was used for simulations to derive exposure metrics for subsequent 
exposure-response analysis. Perl Speaks NONMEM (PsN) (Version 4.8.1) and R package Xpose4 (Version 
4.7.0) were used for model diagnostics and facilitation of NONMEM tasks, such as covariate testing. 
The  population  PK  analysis  was  based  on  1,224  PK  samples  (sparse  sampling)  above  the  limit  of 
quantitation from 211 subjects with AL amyloidosis (28 subjects from Safety Run-in Phase and 183 from 
daratumumab SC+CyBorD treatment arm of randomized phase in Study AMY3001) who received 1800 mg 
daratumumab SC. Eight observations were below the limit of quantification and excluded prior to model 
development. No visible outlier was identified. 
The daratumumab SC modelling was based on a previously developed 2-compartment population PK model 
for  describing  the  PK  characteristics  in  subjects  with  multiple  myeloma.  However,  the  previous  model 
became highly unstable when fitted to the sparse PK samples from AMY3001. The observed concentration-
time data in subjects with AL amyloidosis were best described by a 1-compartment population PK model 
with  first-order  absorption  and  parallel  linear  and  nonlinear  Michaelis-Menten  elimination  pathways.  The 
base  model  was  parameterised  in  terms  of  Ka,  nonspecific  linear  CL/F,  apparent  volume  of  distribution 
(V/F), Vmax, and daratumumab concentrations associated with half Vmax, Km, fixed to the value estimated 
in multiple myeloma patients. The residual error model was additive on log scale.

Figure 1 
Body weight, sex, cardiac stage, proteinuria, renal stage, alkaline phosphatase, renal function (creatinine 
clearance [CrCL]), and hepatic function were the intrinsic factors explored as covariates in the population 
PK analysis. Immunogenicity responses against daratumumab and rHuPH20 were not formally evaluated 
as covariates. A formal covariate analysis was conducted using the likelihood ratio test with significance 
levels of 0.05 and 0.01 for forward addition and backward elimination, respectively. 
In  the  final  covariate  model,  body  weight  and  renal  stage  were  identified  as  statistically  significant 
covariates  on  apparent  nonspecific  linear  CL  (CL/F).  The  following  covariates  on  apparent  volume  of 
distribution were identified as statistically significant: body weight, renal stage, and alkaline phosphatase. 
Table 4 
A nonparametric bootstrap analysis (N=1000) was conducted to evaluate the stability of the final model 
and to estimate confidence intervals (CIs) for the model parameters. Goodness-of-fit plots (GoF) and visual 
predictive checks (VPCs) with prediction correction were used to evaluate the predictive ability of the final 
model.

Absorption 
The population PK model estimated Ka (CV%) was  0.773 1/day (8.31%). The absolute bioavailability of 
daratumumab SC in AL amyloidosis was not estimated since daratumumab IV was not evaluated in Phase 
3 Study AMY3001. The estimated Ka value based on the data from subjects with AL amyloidosis in Study 
AMY3001 was approximately 2.7-fold the estimated value based on the data from subjects with multiple 
myeloma. It is plausible that the difference in Ka values was due to the fact that there was no daratumumab 
IV data available from subjects with AL amyloidosis, and the 1-compartment model after daratumumab SC 
administration was employed for population PK analysis using data from AL amyloidosis subjects in Study 
AMY3001. 
Daratumumab Serum Concentration versus time, is scheduled in figure below.  
Figure 3 
Following  daratumumab  SC  treatment  with  weekly  dosing,  serum  daratumumab  Ctrough  increased  to 
maximum in Cycle 3 Day 1 pre-dose with a mean ± SD of 597 ± 232 µg/mL.

The  mean  (SD)  serum  daratumumab  peak  concentration  after  the  first  dose  (Cpeak,first)  of  149  (58.7) 
μg/mL  following  the  first  daratumumab  SC  administration  occurred on  C1D4,  and  mean  (SD)  maximum 
peak concentration (Cpeak,max) of 708 (280) μg/mL following weekly daratumumab SC dosing occurred 
on C3D4. Mean Cpeak,max on C3D4 was 4.75-fold of the Cpeak, first on C1D4. At EOT, mean (SD) serum 
daratumumab  concentrations  was  225  (216)  μg/mL,  and  then  declined  to  118  (123)  μg/mL  at  post 
treatment Week 8.  
Serum daratumumab concentrations were detectable at 8 weeks after last dose of study drug due to the 
long half-life of daratumumab. 
Distribution 
The  population  PK  model-estimated  apparent  volume  of  distribution  (CV%)  after  SC  administration  was 
10.8 L (3.1%) in subjects with AL amyloidosis. The apparent volume of distribution approached the plasma 
volume.  Body  weight,  baseline  alkaline  phosphatase,  and  renal  stage  were  identified  as  statistically 
significant covariates that affect the apparent volume of distribution. 
Elimination 
Daratumumab undergoes parallel target-mediated (saturable) and linear clearance. The target-mediated 
clearance of daratumumab decreases with multiple dosing, as the target gets depleted. 
The population PK model-estimated apparent nonspecific linear clearance (CV%) after SC administration 
was 0.210 L/day (4.1%) in subjects with AL amyloidosis. The estimated linear apparent clearance was very 
close to the clearance of nonspecific endogenous IgGs in the literature and was related to body weight as 
expected for mAbs. 
The model-derived half-life associated with linear elimination was 27.5 days. The steady-state serum drug 
concentration  appeared  to  have  been  reached  approximately  5  months  after  the  start  of  dosing  at  the 
recommended dosing regimen. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
No dose proportionality study was performed to support this application for subjects with AL amyloidosis. 
In the previous submission of daratumumab SC for multiple myeloma, dose proportionality was assessed 
in Study MMY1004, using the daratumumab mix-and-deliver intermediate SC formulation, where the first-
dose  Cmax  increased  2-fold,  and  eighth-dose  Cmax  increased  approximately  1.4-fold  with  a  1.5-fold 
increase in dose (from 1200 to 1800 mg). The area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to Day 
7  increased  approximately  2-fold  for  first  dose  and  1.4-fold  for  the  eighth  weekly  dose  with  a  1.5-fold 
increase in dose (from 1200 to 1800 mg). 
Special populations 
In the population PK model covariate analysis, intrinsic factors of interest (body weight, sex, cardiac stage, 
proteinuria, renal stage, alkaline phosphatase, renal function, and hepatic function) were investigated for 
their potential impact on the exposure to daratumumab SC in subjects with AL amyloidosis. A forest plot of 
subgroup analyses on simulated daratumumab pre-dose concentrations on C3D1 is presented in the figure 
below. The simulated daratumumab concentrations were generally consistent across different subgroups 
after the recommended dose and schedule, except for body weight, renal stage, and proteinuria.

Figure 4 
Weight 
As  expected  for  a  mAb  administered  SC  by  flat  dose,  higher  serum  daratumumab  concentrations  were 
observed in subjects with lower body weight and lower serum daratumumab concentrations were observed 
in subjects with higher body weight. For the lowest body weight subgroup (≤65 kg), the observed mean 
Ctrough, max of daratumumab on C3D1 was approximately 15% higher than that of the total PK evaluable 
analysis  set.  For  the  highest  body  weight  subgroup  (>85  kg),  the  observed  mean  Ctrough,max  of 
daratumumab on C3D1 was approximately 17% lower than that of the total PK evaluable analysis set. For 
the middle body weight subgroup (>65 to 85 kg), the mean concentration of daratumumab on C3D1 was 
comparable  to  that of  the  total  PK  evaluable  analysis  set.  Based  on  the exposure-response  analyses  for 
efficacy  and  safety,  the  administration  of  1800  mg  daratumumab  SC  flat-dose  achieved  adequate  and 
consistent exposure for all body weight subgroups in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm of Study AMY3001. 
This is demonstrated in attachment 15, please see the figure below.

Figure 5 
Sex 
As sex was identified to be highly correlated with body weight, the slightly higher (25%) exposure following 
1800 mg daratumumab SC administration in female subjects than in male subjects may be driven largely 
by  body  weight.  In  the  final  covariate  analysis,  sex  was  not  identified  to  have  a  significant  impact  on 
daratumumab PK parameters in AL amyloidosis.

Impaired renal function 
Extensive  renal  damage,  measured  by  renal  stage  and  the  degree  of  proteinuria  was  identified  to  be  a 
significant covariate on both the nonspecific linear apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution, 
and was associated with increased elimination of daratumumab in the urine and consequent lower systemic 
exposure. Simulations, based on post hoc PK parameters, demonstrated that exposure to daratumumab 
SC was generally similar (19% lower) for subjects with renal Stage II (C3D1 Ctrough [95% CI]: 566 [519, 
617]  μg/mL)  vs  Stage  I  (C3D1  Ctrough  [95%  CI]:  697  [662,  733]  μg/mL).  Clinical  efficacy  analysis 
suggested  that  the  HemCR  rate  does  not  appear  to  be  related  with  daratumumab  exposure  (71.4%  for 
subjects  with  renal  Stage  II,  compared  with  51.3%  for  subjects  with  renal  Stage  I).  A  lower  (27%) 
daratumumab exposure was observed for subjects with renal Stage III (C3D1 Ctrough [95% CI]: 510 [413, 
631]  μg/mL)  vs  Stage  I.  However,  this  observation  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  small 
sample size (N=17) and overlapping CI between renal Stages III and Stage II. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were performed with daratumumab SC in this submission for 
AL  amyloidosis.  The  potential  of  drug  interactions  with  small  molecules  typically  used  in  AL  amyloidosis 
were not assessed in this submission. However, the previous studies for multiple myeloma program have 
shown  no  drug-drug  interaction  between  daratumumab  and  small-molecules  drugs  used  in  combination 
with daratumumab in multiple myeloma. In addition, the PK of daratumumab following the treatment of 
daratumumab SC+CyBorD in AL amyloidosis appeared to be similar to that in monotherapy and combination 
studies  in  multiple  myeloma,  suggesting  no  drug-drug  interaction  between  daratumumab  and 
cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, or dexamethasone. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
CD38  is  a  multifunctional  glycoprotein  enzyme  that  is  highly  expressed  on  the  cell  surface  of  diverse 
hematologic  malignancies  including  multiple  myeloma  and  clonal  plasma  cells  that  produce  the 
amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain in AL amyloidosis. Daratumumab is a targeted immunotherapy 
directed toward tumor cells that express CD38 such as the clonal plasma cells in multiple myeloma and AL 
amyloidosis. Multiple mechanisms of action have been observed for daratumumab, including complement-
dependent  cytotoxicity,  antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  (ADCC),  antibody-dependent  cellular 
phagocytosis (ADCP), and induction of apoptosis by Fc gamma receptor-mediated crosslinking of tumor-
bound mAbs. See figure below.  
Daratumumab leads to the rapid and sustained elimination of highly immunosuppressive subsets of CD38+ 
Tregs,  CD38+  myeloid-derived  suppressor  cells,  and  CD38+  regulatory  B  cells.  The  elimination of  these 
immunosuppressive  cells,  modulation  of  CD38  enzymatic  activity,  and  destruction  of  the  malignant 
myeloma  cells  are  thought  to  lead  to  the  clonal  expansion  of  CD8+  and  CD4+  T  cells.  Altogether, 
daratumumab’s  converging  mechanisms  of  action  are  hypothesized  to  synergistically  lead  to  the  deep 
responses observed in subjects.

2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-response models 
The relationships between exposure and the response endpoints were investigated using logistic regressions 
or  survival  analysis  implemented  in  R  (Version  3.6.0  or  higher).  The  exposure-efficacy  analyses  were 
performed for the overall best confirmed hematologic response, including HemCR, VGPR, partial response 
(PR), and no response (NR). The exploratory exposure-safety analyses were conducted for selected adverse 
events, including organ disorders, infections, infusion-related reaction events and cytopenia events. The 
influence of body weight on efficacy and safety was also investigated.  
For binary variables, linear logistic regression was used. The confirmed best overall hematologic response 
was  analysed  as  an  ordered  categorical  variable  using  an  ordinal  logistic  regression  model  with  sigmoid 
Emax.  
 Table 6 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021 
Page 23/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The time-to-event variable, major organ deterioration (MOD) PFS, was evaluated by K-M survival curves 
according  to  exposure  quartiles.  A  Cox  proportional  hazard  regression  model  relating  daratumumab 
exposure to reduced hazard of death was also established (Table below). 
Table 7 
If linear logistic regression trends were observed (on slope using a likelihood ratio test versus a constant 
relationship [p<0.05] or using the log-rank test [p<0.05]), further modelling was considered. Final model 
fits for categorical endpoints were evaluated by overlaying exposure-response predictions with observed 
response data with 95% CIs stratified by exposure quartiles, plotted at the median exposure per quartile. 
Final model fits for time-to-event variables were evaluated by overlaying Kaplan-Meier (K-M) time course 
predictions with observed K-M response data with 95% CIs stratified by exposure quartiles. 
For  simulations  that  were performed  for  exposure-response  projections,  the  primary  evaluation  was  the 
univariate exposure-response relationships. The modelled response with CIs was tabulated at the 5th, 25th, 
50th  (median),  75th,  and  95th  percentile  exposure  values.  For  time-to-event  endpoints,  the  modelled 
response was calculated at landmark time points 6 and 12 months. 
Ctrough,max was used as the exposure surrogate for daratumumab. Model fittings with all other exposure 
metrics, Ctrough,first, Cpeak,first, Ctrough,last, and Cpeak, last, showed a positive relationship between 
response probability and exposure (Table below). 
Table 8 
Exposure-response analyses 
By using an Emax model, the exposure response analysis on the primary outcome HemCR rate, suggested 
that the Emax of daratumumab had been attained for the majority of the subjects at the studied 1800 mg 
daratumumab SC dosing regimen in AL amyloidosis (see Figure below).

Exposure-efficacy analyses 
Several PK metrics (trough concentration following the first dose [Ctrough,first], Cpeak,first, Ctrough,max, 
Cpeak,max,  predicted  trough  daratumumab  concentration  following  the  last  dose  [Ctrough,last],  and 
predicted peak daratumumab concentration following the last dose [Cpeak,last]) have been examined for 
their correlations with the efficacy endpoints. Among the tested exposure metrics, the 2 highly correlated 
exposure metrics Ctrough,max and Cpeak,max (r=0.99) had the strongest correlation with HemCR. Since 
both Ctrough,max and Cpeak,max were highly correlated, only Ctrough,max was selected as the exposure 
metric for the subsequent exposure-efficacy analyses. 
The  predicted  daratumumab  Ctrough,max  for  different  categories  of  overall  best  confirmed  hematologic 
response  rate  (including  HemCR,  VGPR,  or  PR)  after  1800  mg  daratumumab  SC+CyBorD  are  shown  in 
Figure below.

EMA/433036/2021 
Page 25/119 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9 
There was observed an improvement in MOD-PFS (major organ deterioration progression free survival) in 
the majority of subjects treated with daratumumab. See Figure below. There was no apparent improvement 
of MOD-PFS in the 1st exposure quartile using Ctrough,max as exposure metric, which may be due to the 
potential confounding effect as a result of time-varying clearance upon improvement of disease dynamics 
following drug treatment (i.e. clearance decreases when disease status improves. Consequently, subjects 
with less improvement of disease tend to have higher clearance and consequently lower Ctrough,max at 
later time points after treatment. This interaction between post-treatment effects and drug exposure may 
lead to a biased steep estimate of the exposure-efficacy response relationship for efficacy, which may be 
the reason to explain that the exposure-response analysis based on Ctrough,max showed similar or lower 
(for the first 7 months) MOD-PFS for the 1st quartile of subjects following the treatment of daratumumab 
SC+CyBorD compared with the 1st quartile of subjects following the treatment of CyBorD while a wider 
separation of remaining daratumumab SC+CyBorD exposure quartiles (2nd quartile to 4th quartile) versus 
CyBorD  was  observed  using  Ctrough,max  as  exposure  parameter,  compared  with  that  when  exposure 
metrics of Cpeak,first was used. These results were similar to those observed in daratumumab studies in 
multiple myeloma.

Figure 10 
The  figure  below  shows  the  exposure-response  relationship  between  the  probability  of  dFLC  and 
daratumumab  Ctrough,max.  Elevated  daratumumab  Ctrough,max  was  associated  with  an  increased 
probability  of  achieving  dFLC<10mg/L  post-treatment,  and  the  relationship  is  statistically  significant 
(p<0.001). The probability of achieving dFLC<10mg/L post-treatment exhibited a statistically significant 
increase with increasing Ctrough,max values (p<0.0001). The observed incidence of achieving dFLC<10 
mg/L posttreatment in the CyBorD alone arm was 30.6% and 60.9%, 63%, 57.8%, and 80.4% in the 1st 
to 4th exposure quartiles of Ctrough,max, respectively, in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm.

Exposure-safety analyses 
There was no clear exposure-response relationship between daratumumab exposure and safety endpoints 
(organ disorders, infections, IRR events, and cytopenia events) using Cpeak,first (for IRR) or Cpeak,max 
(for other endpoints), as shown in Table below. 
Table 9 
Other 
In general, PK parameter estimates from the population PK model of 1800 mg daratumumab SC in subjects 
with AL amyloidosis were similar to estimates from the population PK model of 1800 mg daratumumab SC 
in subjects with multiple myeloma. Based on the population PK simulations, the recommended 1800 mg 
daratumumab SC dose in subjects with AL amyloidosis provided slightly higher Ctrough and Cpeak, but the 
observed  daratumumab  concentrations  in  subjects  with  AL  amyloidosis  were  generally  within  the  same 
range in comparison with observed PK data in subjects with multiple myeloma. 
2.3.5.  Immunogenicity 
In  the  randomized  part  of  the  Phase  3  Study  AMY3001,  a  total  of  182  subjects  were  included  in  the 
daratumumab  immune  response  evaluable  population,  and  181  subjects  were  included  in  the  rHuPH20 
immune response evaluable population in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD treatment arm.  
None (0.0%) of the 182 randomized subjects in the daratumumab SC immune response-evaluable analysis 
set  had  treatment-emergent  anti-daratumumab  antibodies,  indicating  a  low  risk  of  immunogenicity  to 
daratumumab SC when combined with CyBorD.

Eleven (6.1%) of the 181 randomized subjects in the rHuPH20 immune response-evaluable analysis set 
had  treatment-emergent  anti-rHuPH20  antibodies  post  the  first  daratumumab  SC  administration. 
Daratumumab  exposure  was  comparable  between  subjects  with  treatment-emergent  anti-rHuPH20 
antibodies and those who were negative for anti-rHuPH20 antibodies. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
anti-rHuPH20 antibodies was consistent with observations in the Safety Run-in Phase of the study, and with 
the reported incidence of treatment-emergent anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in other daratumumab SC studies.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The main results of the performed PK analyses were consistent with those in previous monotherapy and 
combination studies in multiple myeloma. The bioanalytical methods were accepted in previous procedures. 
The in-study validation for sample analysis conducted in study AMY3001 indicated the methods performed 
well.  
The characterisation of the pharmacokinetics in the target population lead to the development of a one-
compartment  population  PK  model  with  first-order  absorption,  and  parallel  and  nonlinear  elimination 
pathways.  However,  a  previously  developed  population  PK  model  in  patients  with  multiple  myeloma 
revealed that the PK properties of daratumumab were best described using a two-compartment PK model. 
The  MAH  justified  the  difference  in  the  structural  part  of  the  population  PK  model  due  to  the  lack  of 
experimental  evidence  gathered  from  the  Phase  3  clinical  trial  (AMY3001).  However,  the  MAH  aimed  to 
characterise  the  PK  properties  of  daratumumab  using  only  the  experimental  evidence  from  AMY3001, 
without  considering  a  pooled  analysis  with  other  previous  studies  in  order  to  increase  the  experimental 
evidence. A parameter comparison was conducted using the population PK model in MM and AL patients. 
In  general,  the  main  PK  parameters  are  in  agreement  among  both  disease  conditions  (CL/F  and  Vc/F), 
showing the adequacy of the population PK model to serve as a tool to characterize the PK properties of 
daratumumab  in  AL  amyloidosis  patients.  However,  differences  in  Ka  and  covariate  effects  were  found, 
indicating  that  additional  factors  are  highly  contributing  to  explain  differences  among  both  populations. 
Therefore, the current approach may be used only as descriptive purposes in AL amyloidosis patients and 
no dose selection/extrapolation exercises should be conducted. The popPK indicates the patients with body 
weight > 85kg and patients with renal stage II or III have decreased exposure, although a model-based 
analysis revealed that the exposure of these patients was within the exposure of the population with no 
clinically relevant effect in terms of efficacy. On the other hand, no definitive conclusions could be obtained 
in terms of hematologic response between patients in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD and CyBorD treatment 
arms given the small number of subjects in the combined subgroup of subjects with a baseline body weight 
of >85 kg and renal Stage III. 
The observed PK results following 1800 mg daratumumab SC + VCd in subjects with AL amyloidosis from 
this phase 3 study AMY 3001, were consistent with those in previous monotherapy and combination studies 
in multiple myeloma. The observed volume of distribution of 10.8 L after SC administration in patients with 
AL amyloidosis was corresponding to the reported volume of distribution of 5.25 L (central compartment), 
and  3.78  L  (peripheral  compartment),  in  patients  with  multiple  myeloma.  The  results  suggest  that 
daratumumab is primarily localised to the vascular system with limited extra vascular tissue distribution.  
As  an  IgG1қ  mAb,  daratumumab  is  presumably  biotransformed  in  the  same  manner  as  any  other 
endogenous IgG (degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways) and undergoes to 
similar elimination. Renal excretion and hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism of intact daratumumab are 
therefore  unlikely  to  represent  major  elimination  routes.  The  primary  elimination  pathways  for 
daratumumab are clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (degradation into small peptides and amino 
acids in the same way as that for an endogenous IgG) and target-mediated elimination. Values of clearance 
and half-live are similar to many other mAbs.

No dose proportionality study was performed to support this application for subjects with AL amyloidosis 
which is acceptable as this was assessed in Study MMY1004 (previous submission of daratumumab SC for 
multiple myeloma).  
As  expected  for  a  mAb  administered  SC  by  flat  dose,  higher  serum  daratumumab  concentrations  were 
observed in subjects with lower body weight and lower serum daratumumab concentrations were observed 
in subjects with higher body weight. Consequently, this indicates that although weight has an influence on 
the  achieved  serum  daratumumab  concentrations,  whatsoever  it  did  not  have  any  influence  on  the 
exposure-response  analysis  for  efficacy  and  safety.  This  justifies  the  rationale  for  recommendation  of  a 
fixed dose of 1800 mg, for all individuals independently of weight group.  
The totality of the data from the renal Stage III subgroup (which comprises proteinuria) and the moderate 
or  severe  renal  impairment  subgroup  (categorized  by  CrCL)  indicates  that  daratumumab  exposures  in 
subjects with renal damage generally overlap with those of the total PK-evaluable population, suggesting 
that dose adjustment is not needed for subjects in this subpopulation. 
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were performed, and this is considered acceptable. As stated 
by the MAH, there are no overlapping elimination pathways between daratumumab and cyclophosphamide, 
bortezomib or dexamethasone, and therefore no interactions are expected between these agents.  
The exposure-efficacy revealed a smooth and non-linear relationship between experimental Ctrough,max 
levels and probability of complete response (CR), showing that patients at Q1 will show a ~40% probability 
of CR and patients at Q4 a ~60% probability of CR. No exposure-safety relationship has been established 
among the safety variables considered.  
No anti-daratumumab antibodies were detected in serum samples post-daratumumab SC administration. 
There were no apparent PK differences between subjects with positive anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in serum 
samples  at  baseline  or  subjects  who  developed  treatment-emergent  anti-rHuPH20  antibodies  compared 
with subjects with negative anti-rHuPH20 antibodies at baseline or negative for treatment-emergent anti-
rHuPH20 antibodies. These results reflect that the reported minor group of individuals (6.1%) who develop 
positive  anti-rHuPH20,  are  consistent  with  the  reported  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  anti-rHuPH20 
antibodies  in  other  daratumumab  SC  studies.  Overall,  the  data  indicate  a  low  risk  of  immunogenicity  of 
daratumumab when combined with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone in subjects with 
AL amyloidosis. The reported incidence of anti-daratumumab antibodies, and anti-rHuPH20 antibodies, in 
section 5.1 in the SmPC, is a pooled estimate including the incidence of both the MM and AL Amyloidosis 
population. The text has been updated in the SmPC to clarify this.  
All the results from the overall analysis on PK data concerning ADME (absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion) and immunogenicity, were acceptable, and consistent with those from 
previous studies.  
2.3.7.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  aim  of  the  performed  pharmacological  analyses  in  the  Phase  3  study  AMY3001  was  to  assess  PK, 
immunogenicity,  PD,  and  exposure-response  relationship  of  daratumumab  SC  in  subjects  with  AL 
amyloidosis. These analyses are well performed and the results are sufficiently presented without causing 
any major concerns, regarding the implications of the findings.  
The overall conclusion is that the proposed dosing regimen of subcutaneous daratumumab in combination 
with  cyclophosphamide,  bortezomib  and  dexamethasone  in  patients  with  AL  amyloidosis  is  considered 
adequate.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose-response studies have been performed in AL-amyloidosis. Daratumumab administered at a 
dose of 16 mg/kg as IV infusion, is approved in the United States, European Union and other countries as 
monotherapy to patients with relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM), as well as in combination with 
several anti MM therapies to patients with relapsed/refractory and newly diagnosed MM.   
Recently a new SC formulation of daratumumab 1800 mg co-formulated with rHuPH20 has been approved 
by  both  the  FDA  and  EMA  in  relapsed/refractory  Multiple  Myeloma  (studies  MMY3012,  MMY2040  and 
MMY1004).   
The  majority  of  patients  with  amyloidosis  have  cardiac  and  renal  co-morbidities.  The  IV  infusion  of 
daratumumab (1000 mL for the first infusion and 500 mL for the subsequent infusions) could have resulted 
in signs or symptoms of volume overload, particularly for the patients with cardiac or renal insufficiency. 
Given the potential advantages of SC-administration of daratumumab (e.g. small volume; fewer IRRs), this 
study will use a new, co-formulated drug product administered SC. The co-formulated daratumumab and 
rHuPH20  is  a  single,  pre-mixed  vial  with  daratumumab  at  a  higher  concentration  of  120  mg/mL  and 
rHuPH20 at a concentration of 2000 U/mL. The co-formulated drug product will reduce the time for drug 
preparation, reduce the SC-infusion volume to approximately 15 mL, and can be administered in 5 minutes 
by manual SC push.

Treatments 
As this was the first study of daratumumab in treatment-naïve amyloidosis, the study was planned to start 
with a safety run-in of at least 10 subjects who will receive daratumumab plus CyBorD at the full dose for 
each regimen (Fig.1). The safety run-in was to confirm the safety of the new co-formulated drug product 
and the standard treatment regimen. A total of 10 subjects were considered appropriate for the initial phase 
of the study. Dosing of the subjects was staggered to allow for assessment of both, early or delayed IRRs. 
After at least 10 subjects have completed at least 1 cycle of treatment, there was an analysis of safety by 
the sponsor (and external academic hematologists) before proceeding to randomization. 
In the randomized portion of the study, subjects randomized to Treatment Arm A were to receive study 
treatment  with  CyBorD  (Figure  13).  Subjects  randomized  to  Treatment  Arm  B  will  receive  CyBorD  plus 
daratumumab subcutaneously, through a syringe by a manual push over approximately 5 minutes, at a 
fixed dose of 1800 mg. 
Treatment was to be administered in the following order: 
•  Treatment  Arm  A  (CyBorD  alone):  dexamethasone  first,  then  cyclophosphamide,  and  finally 
bortezomib. 
•  Treatment Arm B (CyBorD plus daratumumab): premedication dexamethasone, followed by 
daratumumab, then cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and the remaining dose of dexamethasone. 
All  treatment  cycles  were  4  weeks  (28-day  cycles  with  a  +/-  5-day  window)  in  length.  CyBorD  was 
administered for a maximum of 6 cycles (24 weeks). Cycle 1 should begin within 72 hours of randomization. 
After  Cycle  6,  subjects  may  have  received  daratumumab  monotherapy  on  Day  1  of  subsequent  28-day 
cycles. Treatment with daratumumab was based on the approved daratumumab dosing regimen for multiple 
myeloma: weekly for the first 8 weeks (2 cycles), then every 2 weeks for 4 cycles (Cycles 3-6), and then 
every 4 weeks until progression of disease or subsequent therapy for a maximum of 24 cycles (~2 years) 
from the first dose of study treatment. Dosing schedule is presented in table below.

Table 10 
For  subjects  who  were  older  than  70  years,  underweight  (BMI  <18.5  kg),  had  hypervolemia,  poorly 
controlled  diabetes  mellitus,  or  prior  intolerance/AE  to  steroid  therapy,  the  dexamethasone  dose  was 
administered  at  a  dose  of  20  mg  weekly.  For  subjects  receiving  dexamethasone  20  mg  weekly,  it  was 
recommended that dexamethasone 20 mg was administered as premedication on days of daratumumab 
treatment. 
Subjects would receive pre-infusion and postinfusion medications in line with the SmPC. A schematic of the 
daratumumab dosing schedule is provided in Figure below.  
Figure 14 
Subjects enrolled in the safety run-in phase of the study would be kept in the hospital for observation for 
at least 24 hours after the end of the Cycle 1 Day 1 SC-administration. Subjects enrolled in the randomized 
portion of the study and randomized to Treatment Arm B (CyBorD plus daratumumab) would be observed 
for at least 6 hours after the end of study drug administration during Cycle 1 Day 1 and, if deemed necessary 
by the investigator, after consecutive administrations.

• 
To  explore  minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  status  in  amyloidosis  patients  as  a  surrogate  for 
hematologic progression-free survival (HemPFS) and OS or as a biomarker for relapse 
Exploratory objectives 
•  Hematologic  progression-free  survival  (HemPFS)  is  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of 
randomization to the date of first documentation of hematologic disease progression, according to

•  Assessment of  physical  functioning,  symptom improvement,  functional  improvement,  and health 
utility as measured by the SF-36v2, EORTC QLQ-C30 with supplemental symptom items, and the 
European Quality of Life Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).  
•  Assessment of diastolic heart dysfunction based on analysis of transthoracic echocardiograms. 
Sample size 
The sample size for this study was based on the alternative hypothesis of a 15% improvement in overall 
CHR rate. Taking an overall CHR rate estimated to be 25% for the CyBorD arm (Palladini 2015), adding a 
15%  improvement  translates  to  an  overall  CHR  rate  of  40%  for  the  daratumumab  SC+CyBorD  arm. 
Approximately 360 subjects (180 subjects per arm) would provide more than 85% power to detect a 15% 
improvement in overall CHR rate using a likelihood ratio test with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05. 
The post-treatment observation phase was to continue until approximately 200 MOD-PFS events had been 
observed. Therefore, this study was to achieve an approximately 80% power to detect a 33% reduction in 
the risk of hematologic progression, major organ deterioration, need for subsequent, non-cross resistant, 
anti-plasma cell therapy use for suboptimal hematologic response, and persistent amyloidosis-related organ 
dysfunction  or  death  (HR  [daratumumab  SC+CyBorD  vs  CyBorD]  of  0.67)  with  a  log-rank  test  (2-sided 
alpha=0.05). 
Randomisation 
Central randomization was implemented in this study. Subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either Treatment Arm A (CyBorD alone) or Treatment Arm B (daratumumab SC+CyBorD) based on 
a  computer-generated  randomization  schedule.  The  randomization  was  balanced  by  using  randomly 
permuted blocks and was stratified by cardiac stage (Stage I, II, and IIIa), countries that typically offer 
transplant for patients with AL amyloidosis (List A or List B), and renal function (CrCl ≥60 mL/min or CrCl 
<60 mL/min). Country List A contains the countries that typically offer stem cell transplant while country 
List B contains the countries that do not offer stem cell transplant for patients with AL amyloidosis.   
Blinding (masking) 
This  is  an  open-label  study,  blinding  procedures  were  not  applicable.  An  Independent  Data  Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) will assess the results of the interim analyses. The primary endpoint of overall CHR and 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be adjudicated by an IRC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021

An IDMC, consisting of 2 clinicians and 1 statistician, will be established to review the interim results at the 
planned interim analyses. After the interim review, the IDMC will make recommendations regarding any 
required modification and provide guidance on the continuation of the study.   
Statistical methods 
Primary Efficacy Analysis Set 
The primary efficacy analysis set will be the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which is defined as subjects 
who  have  been  randomly  assigned  to  the  Dara  SC+CyBorD  or  CyBorD  arm.  Analyses  of  the  primary 
endpoint  overall  CHR  rate,  secondary  endpoints,  including  time-to-event  variables  (e.g.,  MOD-PFS,  and 
OS), and demographic and baseline characteristic etc. will be based on this population.

treatment or CyBorD for up to 6 cycles followed by observation. 
Population: subjects with newly diagnosed AL amyloid 
Endpoint: overall complete hematologic response (CHR) 
Intercurrent event: 
• 
Treatment discontinuation 
•  Start  of  subsequent  non-cross  resistant,  anti-plasma  cell  therapy  for  AL  Amyloidosis  without 
hematologic progression 
Measure of intervention: odds ratio of overall CHR rate 
Two different strategies are used to account for the intercurrent events. 
•  Disease assessments after subsequent non-cross resistant, anti-plasma cell therapy will be ignored 
for  a  subject  who  started  subsequent  non-cross  resistant,  anti-plasma  cell  therapy  for  AL 
Amyloidosis (while on treatment strategy). 
• 
Treatment discontinuation will be ignored (treatment policy strategy). 
Stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test will be used to test treatment difference in the proportion 
of subjects who achieved an overall CHR. The CMH estimate of odds ratio and its 95% CI and p-value for 
testing treatment difference will be reported. Stratification factors used in the analysis include cardiac stage 
(Stage I, II, and IIIa), countries that typically offer transplant for patients with AL amyloidosis (List A or 
List B), and renal function (CrCl ≥60 mL/min or CrCl <60 mL/min). 
A sensitivity analysis that target the primary estimand will be performed. The sensitivity analysis will be 
based  on  investigator  assessed  CR  and  computerized  algorithm  derived  CR,  respectively.  Same  analysis 
approach as for the main analysis will be implemented. 
In addition, three planned supplementary analyses will be conducted: 
a)  Changes  the  target  variable  to  CHR  based  on  computer  algorithm  without  confirmation  by  Comenzo 
(2012) with clarifications to CR criteria (i.e., negative serum and urine immunofixation and iFLC<ULN), the 
rest of the estimand remain the same

b)  Changes  the  target  variable  to  CHR  based  on  computer  algorithm  without  confirmation  by  Comenzo 
(2012) with clarifications to CR criteria (i.e., negative serum and urine immunofixation and iFLC<ULN and 
normalization of FLC ratio), the rest of the estimand remain the same 
c) Changes which strategy is employed for the intercurrent event of subsequent non-cross resistant, anti-
plasma cell therapy. If there is a disease assessment that demonstrates CHR before PD after the start of 
subsequent  non-cross  resistant,  anti-plasma  cell  therapy,  the  subject  will  be  considered  as  a  responder 
treatment policy strategy) 
Major secondary endpoint MOD-PFS 
The  primary  treatment  comparison  of  the  distribution  of  overall  MOD-PFS  will  be  based  on  inverse 
probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) log-rank test to adjust for potential dependent censoring due to 
switching to subsequent non-cross resistant, antiplasma cell therapy.  
Due to expected small number of MOD-PFS events at the primary analysis, the distribution comparison of 
MOD-PFS for the 2 treatment groups will be based on unstratified IPCW log-rank test. Hazard ratio and its 
95% confidence interval will be estimated using a unstratified weighted Cox proportional hazards model 
with  treatment  as the  sole  explanatory  variable.  Inverse  probability  of  censoring  weighted  Kaplan-Meier 
curves will be plotted by treatment group.  
At  the  final  MOD-PFS  analysis  (i.e.,  when  approximately  200  MOD-PFS  events  have  been  observed),  a 
stratified  MOD-PFS  analysis  including  stratified  IPCW  log-rank  test,  stratified  weighted  Cox  proportional 
hazards model with treatment as the sole explanatory variable will be performed. 
Table 11 
IPCW 
Time-dependent  stabilised  weights  will  be  calculated  for  each  subject  at  time  (t)  by  estimating  the 
conditional  probability  of  having  remained  uncensored  (i.e.,  not  switching  to  subsequent  non-cross 
resistant,  anti-plasma  cell  therapy)  until  time  t  given  baseline  covariates,  divided  by  the  estimated 
conditional  probability  of  having  remained  uncensored  until  time  t  given  baseline  and  time  dependent 
covariates.  The  following  baseline  covariates  and  time-dependent  prognostic  factors  for  MOD-PFS  and 
switching to subsequent non-cross resistant, anti-plasma cell therapy will be taken into consideration. 
Baseline:  Age  (<65,  >=65),  Sex  (Male,  Female),  Race  (White,  Others),  ECOG  Performance  Score  (0, 
>=1),  Countries  that  typically  offer  transplant  for  patients  with  AL  amyloidosis  (List  A:  countries  that 
typically offer  transplant  or  List  B:  countries that  typically not  offer  transplant),  Baseline  dFLC,  Baseline 
iFLC. Type of FLC (kappa, lambda), Number of organ involvement (<2, vs >=2), Cardiac involvement (Y,

or CrCl <60 mL/min), Renal Stage (I, II, III) 
Time  varying  covariates:  dFLC,  iFLC  level,  PR  status,  CR  status,  Worsening  in  hematologic  response 
criterion from best achieved status, Alkaline Phosphate, eGFR, Proteinuria level, NT-proBNP, Progression of 
organ  disease  (Heart,  Kidney  and  Liver)  as  defined  in  protocol  Table  10  by  laboratory  values,  Organ 
response  (Heart,  Kidney  and  Liver)  as  defined  in  protocol  Table  10  by  laboratory  values,  Interaction  of 
organ function (protocol Table 10) and hematologic response (PR or better), Interaction of organ function 
(protocol Table 10), hematologic response (PR or better) and treatment cycle (<=6 vs >6), Exposure to 
study treatment (study drug discontinued or not). 
Sensitivity Analysis of MOD-PFS 
a. MOD-PFS based on investigator assessed hematologic PD. Same analysis approach as for the primary 
analysis (IPCW method) will be implemented 
b. MOD-PFS based on IRC assessment by using naïve censoring method (i.e., censoring subjects at the last 
disease assessment before start of subsequent non-cross resistant, antiplasma cell therapy) 
c. Unstratified analysis of MOD-PFS based on IRC assessment by using naïve censoring method 
Supplementary Analysis of MOD-PFS 
Supplementary  analyses  including  other  strategies  for  intercurrent  events  of  subsequent  non-cross 
resistant, anti-plasma cell therapy such as treatment policy strategy (no censoring at start subsequent non-
cross  resistant,  anti-plasma  cell  therapy)  and  composite  strategy  (subsequent  noncross  resistant,  anti-
plasma cell therapy will be treated as a MOD-PFS event) will be performed. 
A  time-dependent  Cox  proportional-hazards  model  with  subsequent  non-cross  resistant,  antiplasma  cell 
therapy as a time dependent covariate will be performed for MOD-PFS. 
A supplementary analysis of MOD-PFS based on computer algorithm by censoring for death or hematologic 
progression after missing more than one consecutive disease evaluation will be performed. 
A supplementary analysis of MOD-PFS with adjusted MOD-PFS definition excluding hematologic progression 
from MOD-PFS will be performed. 
Major secondary endpoint OS 
The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the distribution of OS for each treatment group. Median 
OS  with  95%  CI  will  be  provided.  Due  to  expected  small  number  of  death  events  at  the  planned  final 
analysis, the distribution of OS for the 2 treatment groups will be compared based on an unstratified log-
rank test. A p-value from an unstratified log-rank test will be reported. Hazard ratio and its 95% confidence 
interval  will  be  estimated  based  on  an  unstratified  Cox’s  regression  model  with  treatment  as  the  sole 
explanatory variable. 
At the final OS analysis, a stratified OS analysis will be performed. Stratification factors that are used in 
the analyses include cardiac stage (Stage I, II, and IIIa), countries that typically offer transplant for patients 
with AL amyloidosis (List A or List B), and renal function (CrCl ≥60 mL/min or CrCl <60 mL/min).  
Interim analysis and multiplicity considerations 
Two interim analyses are planned for this study. The first interim will occur after the first 30 subjects are 
treated for at least 1 cycle in each arm. The purpose of the first interim analysis is to have a comprehensive 
evaluation of safety.  
The second interim analysis will occur after at least 180 subjects in total have been treated for at least 6 
cycles.  The  purpose  of  the  second  interim  analysis  is  to  evaluate  cumulative interim  safety  and  efficacy

data. Both futility and efficacy stopping rules are built in this interim analysis. The study may be stopped 
due to futility if the complete hematologic response rate in Dara SC+CyBorD arm is the same or worse than 
CyBorD arm. The study may be stopped due to efficacy if the significance level at this interim analysis to 
establish the superiority of Dara SC+CyBorD over CyBorD is less than or equal to 0.0001 (2- sided). The 
primary analysis will occur after all subjects are treated for at least 6 cycles and the alpha to be spent is 
0.04999 (2-sided) by a user defined alpha spending function. 
By the time of second interim analysis, it is estimated that there will be a very limited number of events 
for major secondary endpoints of MOD-PFS and OS. Therefore, only descriptive analysis will be conducted 
without formal hypothesis testing. Formal hypothesis testing of these major secondary endpoints will be 
conducted at the planned primary analysis and/or when approximately 200 MOD-PFS events are observed 
according to group-sequential rules. 
If  the  testing  of  the  primary  endpoint  of  overall  CHR  rate  is  statistically  significant,  the  following  major 
secondary endpoints ordered below will be sequentially tested at the planned primary analysis, each with 
an overall two-sided alpha of 0.05, by utilising a hierarchical testing approach as proposed by Tang and 
Geller  (1999)  that  strongly  controls  Type  I  error  rate.  The  major  secondary  endpoints  are  ordered  as 
follows: 
1) MOD-PFS 
2) OS 
Changes in Planned Analyses 
MOD-PFS 
The  protocol  defined  criteria  for  MOD-PFS  included  dyspnea  at  rest  for  at  least  3  consecutive  days  as  a 
clinical  manifestation  of  cardiac  failure.  In  the  SAP,  this  component  was  removed  due  to  the  subjective 
nature of the event in accordance with HA request. After consultation with FDA and agreed upon by FDA, 
the  primary  analysis  of  MOD-PFS  was  changed  from  analysis  without  censoring  subsequent  non-cross 
resistant, anti-plasma cell therapy to IPCW analysis based on the ITT population. 
Changes in the SAP 
Amendment -2 
Based on FDA comments that dyspnea at rest for at least 3 consecutive days as a clinical manifestation of 
cardiac  failure  has  subjective  nature,  it  was  requested  to  exclude  from  MOD-PFS  definition.  In  addition, 
FDA  has  concern  about  patients  who  received  subsequent  treatment  in  the  absence  of  hematologic 
progression or major organ deterioration 
Summary of Changes: 
•  Dyspnea at rest for at least 3 consecutive days as  a clinical manifestation of cardiac failure was 
excluded from MOD-PFS primary analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021 
Page 42/119 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The  primary  analysis  of  MOD-PFS  will  employ  inverse  probability  of  censoring  weights  (IPCW) 
method to adjust estimates of a treatment effect in the presence of subsequent non-cross resistant 
anti-plasma cell therapy 
•  Added sensitivity analysis and supplementary analysis for MOD-PFS 
•  Added time to iFLC≤ 20 mg/L response 
•  Minor edit changes for clarifications 
Amendment -1 (16Sep2019) 
The primary endpoint, complete hematological response (CHR) rate and key secondary endpoints of major 
organ  deterioration  free  survival  (MOD-PFS)  and  overall  survival  (OS)  remain  the  same.  In  the  original 
plan, a progression-free survival (PFS) endpoint (defined as hematologic progression, or cardiac, kidney or 
liver  progression,  or  death,  whichever  comes  first)  was  planned.  Considering  that  there  is  no  literature 
currently available to assess for clinical meaningfulness of aggregate PFS as an endpoint in AL amyloidosis 
treatment, separate analyses will be conducted for hematological PFS and organ-based progression. In the 
revised plan, the PFS analysis will be specific to hematologic PFS (defined as hematologic progression, or 
death, whichever comes first). Additional landmark analysis on organ response and progression has been 
added for appropriate interpretation of results and meaningful comparison to existing literature. In addition, 
supportive analysis has been added as appropriate (e.g., analysis on iFLC and dFLC, time to PR or better 
and additional subgroups). Further editorial changes were made throughout the document for clarification. 
Summary of changes: 
• 
PFS analysis will be specific to hematologic PFS and moved to exploratory endpoint. PFS endpoint 
was removed from statistical hierarchical testing 
•  Added organ response and progression 6-month landmark analysis for each involved organ 
•  Added t(11:14) and high risk of cytogenetic subgroup 
•  Added time to and duration of PR or better response 
•  Added Time to iFLC<ULN and Time to dFLC<10 mg/dL response 
•  Replaced time to organ progression with time to cardiac progression, time to renal progression and 
time to liver progression 
•  Added  attachments  of  hematologic  PD  and  response  computerized  algorithm  and  additional 
exploratory analysis to support HEMAR. 
•  Minor edit changes for clarifications 
Results 
Participant flow 
At the time of clinical cut-off (14 February 2020), 388 subjects across 22 countries were enrolled in the 
randomized portion of the study to receive treatment with either daratumumab SC+CyBorD (195 subjects) 
or CyBorD (193 subjects). Two subjects in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm and 5 subjects in the CyBorD 
arm were randomized but never treated due to consent withdrawal.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was dated 6 April 2017. There were 3 amendments to the protocol, as summarized 
below. 
Amendment  1  (03  April  2018):  To  revise  the  AL  amyloidosis  response  consensus  criteria.  Key  changes 
included: Clarification of the censoring of data for secondary endpoints of time to complete hematologic 
response and time to organ response. Stratification by cardiac stage will be based on the Mayo Clinic Cardiac 
Staging  System.  The  renal  organ  response  criteria  updated  as  detailed  in  Palladini  2014.  Subjects  with 
Assessment report

hypersensitivity  or  contraindications  to  cyclophosphamide  or  any  of  its  metabolites  were  excluded. 
Clarification  of  the  definition  of  hematologic  progressive  disease  based  on  the  recommendation  of  the 
AMY3001 Steering Committee that detectable monoclonal protein must be above a pre-defined quantitative 
level to qualify for progression. 
Amendment 2 (23 January 2019): Identification of a new important risk (HBV reactivation), and how to 
manage subjects with the potential for HBV reactivation.  
Amendment 3 (10 October 2019): To clarify that an aggregated (hematologic and organ) PFS was split into 
a specific HemPFS which was moved to an exploratory objective, while retaining organ-specific response 
rate and duration of response as secondary objectives; a CHR analysis at 6 months was added; Severity 
Criteria for adverse events were revised to align with NCI-CTCAE v4.03 severity definitions; and updated 
anticipated  events  in  Attachment  12.  To  clarify,  that  normalisation  of  uFLC  level  and  FLC  ratio  are  not 
required when determining complete hematologic response. 
Protocol deviations 
All protocol deviations of eligibility criteria and those deviations that could impact subject safety or primary 
endpoints were considered MPDs.

Outcomes and estimation 
Updated results with an additional 9 months of follow-up (clinical cut-off: 13 November 2020), since the 
primary analysis (clinical cut-off: 14 February 2020), resulted in a HemCR of 59.0% vs. 19.2%, for D-VCd 
vs. VCd, respectively; odds ratio [95% CI]=5.90 (3.72, 9.37); p<0.0001). 
The median duration of treatment was 9.6 months in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm and 5.3 months 
in the CyBorD arm.

Hematologic CR at 6 and 12 Months 
The CHR rate was higher in the dara SC + CyBorD group compared with the CyBorD at 6 months: 49.7% 
vs 14.0%, respectively, (odds ratio=6.09 with 95% CI: 3.70, 10.03; p<0.0001). At 12 months the CHR 
rate was: 28.2% vs 7.3%, respectively, (odds ratio=5.24 with 95% CI: 2.77, 9.90; p<0.0001).  
Time to Hematologic Response 
Table 25 
Duration of Hematologic Response 
With  a  median  follow-up  of  11.4  months,  the  median  duration  of  CHR  had  not  been  reached  in  either 
treatment arm (range: 0.85+ to 17.5+ months for daratumumab SC+CyBorD; 0.03+ to 18.4+ months for 
CyBorD).  Similarly,  was  the  median  duration  of  VGPR  or  better  and  duration  of  PR  or  better  in  both 
treatment  arms  not  reached  as  the  majority  of  responders  continued  to  respond  without  hematologic 
progression. 
Time to Subsequent Non-cross Resistant Anti-plasma Cell Therapy 
More subjects in the CyBorD arm (43%) received subsequent non-cross resistant anti-plasma cell therapy 
compared with subjects in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm (10.8%). The median time to subsequent 
non-cross resistant anti-plasma cell therapy was not reached for subjects in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD 
arm  and  was  10.38  months  in  the  CyBorD  arm  (HR=0.20,  95%  CI:  0.12,  0.32;  p<0.0001)  (see  table

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  current  marketing  application  includes  one  randomized,  open-label,  active  controlled  Phase  3  study 
AMY3001 for newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis: 
•  A Randomized Phase 3 Study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daratumumab in combination 
with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) compared with CyBorD in newly 
diagnosed systemic AL amyloidosis. 
The following indication was initially proposed: 
•  Daratumumab  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  systemic  light  chain  (AL) 
amyloidosis. 
Clinical data cut-off for the study was February 2020. An additional 9 months of data were requested and 
provided during the assessment procedure (cut-off 13 November 2020). Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years 
of  age  with  a  newly  diagnosed  AL  (light  chain)  amyloidosis  and  with  ECOG  0-2.  Patients  had  to  have 
measurable hematologic disease, at least one affected organ, cardiac Stage I-IIIA (based on the modified 
Mayo 2004 Cardiac Staging), and NYHA Class I-IIIA. Patients with NYHA Class IIIB and IV were excluded. 
The MAH has amended the wording of indication to reflect that all patients received CyBorD as backbone 
therapy (see below). The fact that all patients should have at least one organ impacted, and the exclusion 
of patients with NYHA classification IIIB and IV is adequately reflected in the SmPC, Section 5.1.  Patients 
were  randomised  1:1  to  receive  a  standard  regimen  CyBorD  (cyclophosphamide  300  mg/m
2 
oral  or  IV, 
bortezomib 1.3 mg/m
SC, and dexamethasone 40 mg oral or IV) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day 
2 
cycle with or without a fixed dose of daratumumab 1.800 mg SC once weekly from weeks 1 to 8 (Cycles 1-
2), once every 2 weeks from weeks 9 to 24 (Cycles 3-6), then once every 4 weeks until disease progression 
or a maximum of two years. The daratumumab SC dose and schedule is based on previous data from Study 
MMY3012 and is approved in Multiple Myeloma. The CyBorD was given for a maximum of 6 cycles. 
The study design was appropriate as was the primary endpoint, overall CHR rate and secondary endpoints. 
The  overall  CHR  is  regarded  as  an  appropriate  primary  endpoint  for  phase  III  trials  employing 
chemotherapeutic agents for newly diagnosed untreated AL amyloidosis patients without advanced cardiac 
involvement,  according  to  international  consensus  recommendations  (Comenzo  2012,  Palladini  2012). 
Indeed, even if surrogacy for OS has not been demonstrated, there seems to be a clear association between 
CHR and long-term outcomes (MOD-PFS and OS), i.e. particularly significant decreases in the pathologic or 
involved FLC (iFLC) are associated with better survival. There were several secondary endpoints, such as 
MOD-PFS, OS, hematologic VGPR or better, time and duration of hematologic response. The protocol was 
amended twice, based on request from the FDA, dyspnoea was removed from the MOD-PFS definition and 
IPCW was applied as the primary method. With reference to Amendment 3 a new secondary endpoint was 
added:  “Complete  Haematologic  Response  at  6  months”.  The  MAH  has  clarified  that  this  endpoint  was 
specified  as  one  of  the  secondary  endpoints  in  the  original  SAP  and  later  added  in  the  protocol,  at 
Amendment 3,  for  appropriate interpretation  of  results  and  meaningful  comparison to existing literature 
(as this endpoint is widely reported in the literature in subjects with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis). In 
addition, the MAH noted that HemCR rate at 6 months was analysed, as a supportive endpoint, only after 
the  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  conducted,  to  ensure  the  appropriate  statistical 
interpretation of the results. Even if it relates to secondary endpoints and not the primary efficacy endpoint 
at amendment 3 (10 October 2019) the aggregated PFS (both haematological and organ) was split into a 
specific  HemPFS  which  was  moved  to  an  exploratory  objective.  MOD-PFS  was  retained  as  a  secondary 
endpoint  which  seems  reasonable.  According  to  the  MAH,  the  split  was  aimed  to  an  appropriate 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021 
Page 68/119 
 
 
 
 
interpretation of results and for meaningful indirect comparison to existing literature and had no impact on 
the  final  outcomes.  Even  if  amendment  3  appears  to  have  been  implemented  once  all  patients  were 
recruited  in  the  study  bearing  in  mind  that  it  did  not  affect  the  primary  endpoint  but  only  exploratory 
analyses of secondary/exploratory endpoints, it is acknowledged that this change had not compromised the 
study results.   
The  clinical  response  was  evaluated  based  on  International  Consensus  Criteria  as  determined  by  the 
Independent Review Committee (IRC) and validated by computerised algorithm with 3 stratification factors: 
cardiac stage (I, II, IIIa, European Modification of Mayo 2004 Cardiac Stage), countries that typically offer 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis (list A) and those who 
do not (list B), and renal function ( CrCl ≥ 60 ml/min and < 60 ml/min). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 388 patients were randomized, 195 to dara SC + CyBorD and 193 to CyBorD. The median age 
was  62  and  64  years  respectively  with  a  similar  range,  and  44.6%  and  49.7%  respectively  being  ≥  65 
years. The median time since diagnosis was 43 days, with a wide range (5;1611). A total of 8 subjects had 
a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis for more than 2 years prior to study inclusion, 5 of these had AL amyloidosis 
for  1000  days  and  1  subject  had  AL  amyloidosis  for  865  days.  These  subjects  had  more  localised 
manifestations of the disease and did not receive any treatment. They also met the eligibility criteria for 
the study AMY 3001.  
The majority of subjects (79.1%) had lambda free light chain disease and the median number of organs 
involved at baseline was 2 (range 1;6) in both treatment arms. The most common organs involved were 
cardiac (71.4%) and renal (59.0%), being similar in the dara SC + CyBorD and CyBorD groups. Patients 
had NYHA class I (50.3%), II (42.8%) and IIIA (7.0%), according to the revised Mayo cardiac stage, 23.2% 
had stage I, 40.2% had stage II and 34.5% had stage IIIA with a balanced allocation for the two treatment 
arms. In general baseline demographic – and disease characteristics were well balanced between the two 
treatment arms. However, the analysis by ECOG at baseline (i.e. ECOG PS 0 vs.  ECOG PS 1 or 2) could be 
considered somewhat misleading, since the results in the group with the worst status (ECOG 2) might be 
diluted by the results in the higher represented group of patients with ECOG PS 1. Even if there are few 
patients enrolled with ECOG PS 2 (total of 35 patients) the MAH was invited to present data by ECOG status 
separately.  These  data  have  been  presented  and  the  reported  percentages  of  response  remain  similar 
among all the groups, including the very small one of patients with ECOG PS 2 (n=16).   
The  MAH  has  narrowed  the  previous  broad  indication  to:  "DARZALEX  is  indicated  in  combination  with 
cyclophosphamide,  bortezomib  and  dexamethasone  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  newly 
diagnosed systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis.” This new indication reflects the study population of the 
AMY3001 study and is acceptable. The fact that all patients had one or more organ affected and that none 
of  the  included  patients  had  NYHA  IIIB  or  higher  and  very  few  Mayo  cardiac  stage  IIIB  has  also  been 
adequately reflected in the SmPC, Section 5.1. The SC formulation of daratumumab is endorsed.  
With  a  median  follow-up  of  11.4  months,  an  overall  CHR  rate  of  53.1%  in  the  dara  SC+CyBorD  arm 
compared with 18.1% in the CyBorD arm (odds ratio=5.13; 95% CI: 3.22, 8.16; p<0.0001) is considered 
clinically relevant and meaningful in this group of newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with organ involvement. 
Pre-planned  sensitivity  analysis  of  CHR  based  on  investigator  evaluation  and  computerised  algorithm, 
showed consistent results.  The CHR rates were consistent for the pre-planned stratification factors (cardiac 
stage,  renal  function  and  whether  countries  offer  ASCT  or  not),  in  favour  of  the  dara  SC+CYBorD  arm 
compared with the CyBorD arm. Analysing poor prognostic groups: the presence of t(11;14) analysed by 
FISH,  Cardiac  stage  III  and  dFLC  >  180  mg/L  indicated  a  trend  towards  a  beneficial  effect  of  the  Dara 
SC+CyBorD arm compared with CyBorD, however, the interpretation of the results in the subgroups are 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021 
Page 69/119 
 
 
 
 
hampered  by  the  small  sample  size  and  no  statistically  significant  difference  could  be  demonstrated. 
However, the median duration of CHR has not been reached at the time of clinical cut-off in either treatment 
groups. Fewer patient in the daratumumab SC + CyBorD arm compared with the CyBorD alone arm received 
subsequently ASCT. Besides from geographical differences in the use of ASCT, one of the reasons to this 
difference could be the higher HemCR rate in the dara SC+CyBorD arm, and the fact that subjects in the 
dara SC+ CyBorD arm continued daratumumab beyond the 6 cycles of CyBorD. The VGPR or better rate, 
was significantly higher in the Dara SC + CyBorD group compared with CyBorD alone, 78.5% vs. 49.2%, 
(Odds ratio 3.75; 95% CI:2.40, 5.85; p< 0.0001). The median time to overall CHR was 60 days for the 
dara SC+CyBorD arm and 85 days for the CyBorD arm.  
Time to response is an important variable, for subjects who achieved CHR, the median time to CHR was 
60.0 days in the dara SC+CyBorD arm and 85.0 days in the CyBorD arm, respectively. For subjects who 
achieved ≥VGPR, the median time to ≥VGPR was 17 days in the dara SC+CyBorD arm and 25 days in the 
CyBorD arm.   
Measures  of  and  time  to  deep  hematologic  responses  were  superior  for  daratumumab  SC+CyBorD 
compared with CyBorD alone when assessed by: 
• 
• 
• 
iFLC <ULN (76.4% vs. 36.3%; time to iFLC <ULN: 17 vs. 30.5 days), 
iFLC ≤20 mg/L (70.8% vs. 20.2%; time to iFLC ≤20 mg/L: 24 vs. 32 days), and 
dFLC <10 mg/L (64.1% vs. 30.6%; time to dFLC <10 mg/L: 29 vs. 56 days) 
This is considered relevant information since significant decreases in the pathologic or involved FLC (iFLC) 
are associated with better survival in this patient population (Comenzo et al., 2012). The depth and rapidity 
of hematologic responses to daratumumab SC plus CyBorD is noticed. Although the Kaplan-Meier curves 
for MOD-PFS separates after 6.5 months, MOD-PFS is not a standard acceptable endpoint in AL amyloidosis 
and  the  data  are not  mature  with  only  43% of  the 200  planned events  at  the  time  of  analysis.  It  could 
however be of value from a clinical point of view, but the IPW method used is regarded as hypothetical, 
indicating the results should be considered exploratory.   
As a supplement to MOD-PFS, Major Organ Deterioration Event-free Survival (MOD-EFS) was introduced. 
Subjects  may  switch  to  subsequent  non-cross  resistant,  anti-plasma  cell  therapy  due  to  insufficient 
hematologic response or aggravating organ function. The median MOD-EFS was 8.8 months for the CyBorD 
arm,  but  not  reached  in  the  dara  SC+CyBorD  arm  (HR=0.39;  95%  CI:  0.27,  0.56;  nominal  p-value 
<0.0001). As of the clinical cut-off of 14 February 2020, OS data were not mature. The majority of early 
deaths  were  observed  in  subjects  with  baseline  cardiac  involvement.  Even  if  CHR  is  a  relevant  primary 
endpoint  and  the  observed  effect  likely  to  translate  into  clinically  relevant  benefit,  OS  data  are  also  of 
noticeable importance. However according to published data (Palladini 2015) 55% of subjects with newly 
diagnosed AL amyloidosis and treated with CyBorD, are estimated to survive 5 years. The updated OS data 
of  further  9  months  of  follow-up  are  still  immature  and  the  MAH  should  provide  the  primary  and  final 
analyses of OS as a post-authorisation efficacy study.  A trend towards improvement of cardiac – and renal 
6-month response was noted, from a clinical point of view it is interesting whether the beneficial effect of 
achieving complete hematologic response can affect the organ response and diminish the organ failure. The 
MAH has updated the results with a further period of 9 months of follow-up. The updated data are consistent 
with the primary analysis.  
In  summary,  based  on  the  data  submitted  daratumumab  SC  +  CyBorD  combination  appears  to  be  an 
adequate option for treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare, complex disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 
The  prognosis  for  AL  amyloidosis  is  associated  with  early  diagnosis,  treatment,  and  the  extent  of  organ 
involvement. The achievement of a rapid and deep CHR is the essential goal of therapy in AL amyloidosis. 
It has been demonstrated that the depth of hematologic response is associated with organ improvement 
and better survival in patients with AL amyloidosis (Palladini 2012). However, there is no licensed therapy 
regimen  for  AL  amyloidosis  and  several  multiple  myeloma  regimens  have  been  introduced.  The  CyBorD 
regimen is recommended by the NCCN and consensus guidelines and is the preferred regimen for newly 
diagnosed AL amyloidosis as it has less cardiac and renal toxicities than the IMiDs and other combinations.  
Most studies using CyBorD in AL amyloidosis are retrospective, the largest in front line AL amyloidosis with 
HemCR of 21%, VGPR of  22%, cardiac response achieved in 17% of patients, while renal response was 
observed in 25% of the patients. 
An overall CHR rate of 53.1% in the dara SC+CyBorD arm compared with 18.1% in the CyBorD arm (odds 
ratio=5.13; 95% CI: 3.22, 8.16; p<0.0001) is therefore considered clinically relevant and meaningful in 
this group of newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with organ involvement. The MAH has amended the wording 
of  indication  to:  “DARZALEX  is  indicated  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide,  bortezomib  and 
dexamethasone  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  systemic  light  chain  (AL) 
amyloidosis”  therefore  adequately  reflecting  the  patients  included  in  the  AMY3001  study  (i.e.  newly 
diagnosed AL amyloidosis patients) and also the CyBorD backbone treatment.   
OS data are still immature and although thus far do not suggest a detrimental effect of dara SC + CyBorD 
on OS, which is reassuring, provision of final OS data is considered key to benefit risk. In this regard the 
MAH  has  committed  to  provide  the  primary  and  final  analyses  of  OS  from  study  AMY3001  as  a  post 
authorization commitment. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
The MAH should provide the final overall survival analysis as a post-authorisation efficacy study by 31 July 
2025. If a statistically significant difference in OS is demonstrated after adjusting for multiple data looks 
and multiplicity, the MAH will submit OS data for the agency’s review. Otherwise, the MAH will share the 
interim OS results and the final OS data will be provided at the time of the final analysis as an Annex II 
condition.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
For  this  application,  the  safety  of  daratumumab  SC  in  combination  with  CyBorD  (cyclophosmamide-
bortezonib-dexamethasone) in subjects with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis is based on results from the 
Phase  3  Study  AMY3001.  Safety  data  and  exposure  were  evaluated  in  the  Safety  Analysis  Set,  which 
included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 administration of any study treatment (partial or 
complete). Safety analyses were based on the safety analysis population, which included subjects treated 
in  the  Safety  Run-in  and  randomized  parts of  the  study.  At  the time of  the  clinical  cut-off  (14  February 
2020), 388 subjects across 22 countries were randomized to receive treatment with either daratumumab 
SC-CyBorD or CyBorD. There were 193 and 188 subjects treated with daratumumab SC-CyBorD or CyBorD, 
respectively. 
Due to the study design, daratumumab was continued beyond the initial 6 cycles of CyBorD, resulting in a 
longer median duration of exposure for subjects in the daratumumab SC-CyBorD arm compared with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021 
Page 71/119 
 
 
 
 
CyBorD arm. TEAEs were to be reported up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment, thus TEAE rates 
should  be  interpreted  in  the  context  of  the  longer  median  exposure  duration  for  subjects  in  the 
daratumumab  SC-CyBorD  arm  compared  with  the  CyBorD  arm.  To  provide  this  perspective,  AEs  are 
summarized over the total duration of the study as well as by Cycles 1-2 (during which a similar number 
of  subjects  received  treatment),  Cycles  3-6  (during  which  more  subjects  discontinued  treatment  in  the 
CyBorD arm) and beyond Cycle 7 (during which only subjects in the daratumumab SC-CyBorD arm received 
study treatment. Additionally, exposure adjusted evaluation of TEAEs was performed. 
Table 31 
Safety Run-in phase: Given the potential safety concern with regards to the use of IV daratumumab in the 
amyloidosis  population  (i.e.,  volume  overload),  this  study  utilised  the  daratumumab  SC  formulation. 
Patients  with  newly  diagnosed  AL  amyloidosis  were  still  at  risk  of  developing  AEs  attributable  to 
hypervolemia  (e.g.,  dyspnea,  peripheral  edema)  secondary  to  amyloid-induced  cardiac  or  renal 
insufficiency. Additionally, daratumumab had not been co-administered with CyBorD. Therefore, prior to 
the start of the randomized portion of the study to evaluate daratumumab SC in combination with CyBorD, 
a Safety Run-in was conducted and safety evaluation was planned to be assessed after at least 10 patients 
had received at least 1 cycle of treatment. Safety evaluation was performed by the sponsor and external 
haematologists after 15 patients had received at least 1 cycle of treatment. 
All 28 patients in the Safety Run-in cohort had 1 or more TEAEs, and 75% had 1 or more Grade 3 or 4 
TEAEs.

Patient exposure 
The  median  total  dose  (exposure)  of  cyclophosphamide  (mg/m2),  bortezomib  (mg/m2),  and 
dexamethasone  (mg)  was  well-balanced  during  Cycles  1-2  and  slightly  higher  in  the  daratumumab 
SC+CyBorD  arm  during  Cycles  3-6,  which  is  likely  reflective  of  more  subjects  in  the  CyBorD  arm 
discontinuing  study  treatment  starting  from  Cycle  3  onward.  Comparatively,  the  extent  of  exposure  of 
individual study agents, cyclophosphamide (mg/m2), bortezomib (mg/m2), and dexamethasone (mg); as 
measured during each respective cycle for the first 6 cycles; was similar between treatment arms: 
• 
• 
• 
The median total dose of cyclophosphamide ranged from 1022.9 to 1077.7 mg/m2 for CyBorD arm 
and from 1025.3 to 1041.6 mg/m2 for the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm. The protocol-specified 
dose of cyclophosphamide was 1200 mg/m2 per cycle (with a maximum weekly dose of 500 mg). 
The median total dose of bortezomib ranged from 5.1 to 5.2 mg/m2 for the CyBorD arm and 5.1 
mg/m2 across all 6 cycles for the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm. The protocol-specified dose of 
bortezomib was 5.2 mg/m2 per cycle. 
The median total dose of dexamethasone was 160 mg/cycle for all cycles for both treatment arms. 
The protocol-specified dose of steroid required per cycle was 160 mg. 
The median relative dose intensities for cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone were 
consistent across the treatment arms (cyclophosphamide: 85.8% vs 86.1% in the daratumumab 
SC+CyBorD and CyBorD arms, respectively; bortezomib: 96.6% vs 97.4% respectively; dexamethasone: 
100% in each arm). The median relative dose intensity for daratumumab was 100%.

The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs was during Cycles 1-2 (daratumumab SC+CyBorD: 34.2%, CyBorD: 
31.9%)  and  Cycles  3-6  (daratumumab  SC+CyBorD:  43.5%,  CyBorD:  44.2%),  respectively.  In  the 
daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm, 18.1% (27/149) of patients had Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs from Cycle 7 onwards 
(see table above).                             
The most common (>2%) Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs from Cycle 7 onwards were Blood and Lymphatic System 
Disorders (4.7% total: lymphopenia (3.4%), neutropenia (1.3%), leukopenia (0.7%)) followed by 
Infections and Infestations (4.0% total: pneumonia (2.0%), sepsis, lower respiratory tract infection, 
influenza, and peritonitis (0.7% each)), and Cardiac Disorders (2.7% total: angina pectoris (1.3%), 
cardiac failure, atrial flutter, and arteriospasm coronary (0.7% each)), and Respiratory, Thoracic and 
Mediastinal Disorders (2.7% total: dyspnea, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (0.7% each)) (see tables above). 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Infusion-related  reactions  (IRR),  infections  and  infestations,  opportunistic  infections,  peripheral 
neuropathies, cardiac disorders, and renal and urinary disorders are considered adverse events of special 
interest (AESI) for daratumumab SC.

Of the 193 patients who received daratumumab SC+CyBorD, 7.3% of these patients experienced an IRR 
(see table above), IRRs were Grade 1 or 2 and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. Fourteen patients 
(7.3%) in daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm had an IRR. The majority of these IRRs occurred during the first 
dose  administration,  12  patients  (6.2%).  Two  (1%)  patients  had  IRRs  during  the  second  dose 
administration and 3 (1.6%) patients during subsequent dose administrations.

Table 57 
The MAH presented further results regarding patients who had renal disorders before initiation of 
treatment at baseline, 113 subjects (58.5% [113/193]) in daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm and 112 
subjects (59.6% [112/188]) in the CyBorD arm presented with renal involvement. A higher incidence of 
(≥10%) of TEAEs was observed in subjects with renal involvement at baseline compared with those 
without renal involvement at baseline.                                                                                                                       
In the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm 50.4% vs 36.3% experienced a higher incidence (≥5%) of anemia, 
lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia for those with renal involvement vs those without renal involvement 
at baseline (31.0% vs 15.0% anemia, 22.1% vs 13.8% lymphopenia, and 19.5% vs 13.8% 
thrombocytopenia).  
Renal and urinary disorders (yes vs no) were equally distributed in the two treatment arms: 26.5% vs 
13.8% in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD; 23.2% vs 10.5% in the CyBorD arm. In the daratumumab 
SC+CyBorD arm, a higher incidence (≥5%) of renal impairment was observed for those who were renally 
impaired vs not renally impaired at baseline (7.1% vs 1.3%). In the CyBorD arm, a higher incidence 
(≥5%) of renal impairment was observed for those who were renally impaired at baseline vs not renally 
impaired (9.8% vs 0%).    
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
At the time of primary analysis, 27 patients (14.0%) in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm died and 28 
patients (14.9%) in the CyBorD arm died. Additionally, 1 patient in the CyBorD arm died prior to receiving 
any treatment. 
More patients in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm (11.9%) died due to an AE during study compared to 
the CyBorD arm (7.4%).  
Deaths due to AE within 30 days of last study treatment were reported for 10.4% of patients in the 
daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm and 7.4% of patients in the CyBorD arm (see Table below).  TEAEs were 
to be reported up to 30 days after the last study treatment. As patients could change therapy after 3 
cycles for insufficient hematological response and patients in the CyBorD arm could receive subsequent 
therapy after the 6 cycles of study treatment were completed, deaths and other untoward events

occurring after start of subsequent therapy and during the follow-up period were no longer reported as 
AEs, contributing to the lower rate of AEs, including AEs leading to deaths, reported in the CyBorD arm.   
At the primary cutoff, the number of reported deaths were similar (27 vs 29) between the arms and with 
longer  follow  up,  fewer  deaths  were  reported  in  the  daratumumab  SC+CyBorD  arm  compared  with  the 
CyBorD arm (31 vs 41).  
Table 58 
The most common (≥2% in either treatment arm) AEs leading to death were cardiac disorders. All 
patients who died due to cardiac disorders had cardiac involvement at baseline (daratumumab 
SC+CyBorD: 14/14, CyBorD: 7/7. (Table 32)

Table 59 
The majority of deaths due to TEAEs in both treatment arms occurred in patients with cardiac involvement 
at baseline: 21 of the 22 patients in the daratumumab arm had cardiac involvement at baseline and all 
patients (15/15) in the CyBorD arm had cardiac involvement at baseline. The most common (≥2% in either 
treatment arm) AEs leading to death were cardiac arrest (daratumumab SC+CyBorD: 3.1%, CyBorD: 1.6%) 
(see table below).

arm, there are 25 patients in the safety population (25/188 (13.3%)) with a reported Grade 5 or SAEs of 
cardiac-related toxicity. The majority of patients (54/55) reported baseline cardiac Stage II or Stage III; 
and 46/55 patients reported baseline NYHA Class II or Class IIIA (TSFAE05P).

Neutropenia by Body Weight 
The incidence of any grade (≤65kg: 19.4%, >65 to 85kg: 9.5%, >85kg: 0%) and Grade 3 or 4 (≤65 kg: 
9.7%, >65 to 85 kg: 4.2%, >85 kg: 0%) neutropenia was higher in the lower body weight subgroup (≤65 
kg) for the SC+CyBorD arm; this trend was not observed in the CyBorD arm. 
Thrombocytopenia by Body Weight 
The incidence of any grade (≤65 kg: 21%, >65 to 85 kg: 15.8%, >85 kg: 13.9%) and Grade 3 or 4 (≤65 
kg:  6.5%,  >65  to  85  kg:  2.1%,  >85  kg:  0%)  thrombocytopenia  was  higher  in  the  lower  body  weight 
subgroup (≤65 kg) for the SC+CyBorD arm. In the CyBorD arm, Grade 3 or 4 (≤65 kg: 4.2%, >65 to 85 
kg: 1.4%, >85 kg: 2.2%) thrombocytopenia was higher in the lower body weight subgroup (≤65 kg). These 
differences did not lead to an increase in treatment discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia. There were 
no serious cases of thrombocytopenia in the SC+CyBorD arm.

The MAH was asked to provide the main safety data (frequency, types and severity of AEs, SAEs, deaths) 
for the following patients’ subgroups: - patients ≥75 years old; - patients between the ages of 65 and 75, 
with important co-morbidities (ex. renal- and liver status) and/or a poor performance status (i.e. ECOG 
2), given that this population could be more fragile and could have a worse tolerability to the drugs 
combination. Results are presented in tables below:

Post marketing experience 
Daratumumab SC has only recently been authorised for use in the US, EU and other countries worldwide.  
Daratumumab SC has not been authorised for use in subjects with AL amyloidosis in any country worldwide. 
Post-marketing  safety  information  is  available  for  daratumumab  IV  and  from  a  commercially  available 
rHuPH20 formulation, Hylenex. 
Daratumumab IV:  
A cumulative review was performed on all post-marketing spontaneous cases of daratumumab IV and all 
events received by the Global Medical Safety (GMS) global safety database cumulatively through 31 March 
2020. The results suggest that the drug’s post-marketing safety profile is consistent with the known safety 
profile of daratumumab as a single agent or in combination therapy. 
Based  on  the  cumulative  review,  a  total  of  2,122,655,000  mg  of  daratumumab  distributed  from  launch 
(cumulative to 31 March 2020), the estimated cumulative exposure to daratumumab in marketed use is 
81,059 person years. 
A search of the GMS global safety database through 31 March 2020 retrieved a total of 6,820 cases. Of 
these, 621 cases were excluded due to medical unconfirmed cases or multiple unidentifiable patients, and 
6,199  were  further  analysed.  Of  the  cases  reporting  patient  sex,  slightly  more  than  half  (55.4%, 
2,158/3,893)  concerned  males  and  where  age  or  age  group  was  reported,  the  majority  of  the  cases 
concerned elderly patients (62.0%; 1,949/3,145). 
The patients ranged in age from 1.7 to 100 years (mean age 66.5 years and median age 69 years).  Among 
the  6,199  cases,  3,539  were  serious.  Review  of  the  serious  cases  revealed  that  the  following  preferred 
terms  were  reported  with  the  greatest  frequency  (≥2%  event  rate):  infusion-related  reaction  (9.3%),

disease progression (4.4%), death (3.6%), neutropenia (3.2%), pneumonia (3%), plasma cell myeloma 
and thrombocytopenia (2.8% each), and dyspnea (2.7%). 
A  total  of  621  cases  reported  events  with  a  fatal  outcome.  Among  these  cases,  the  most  common  fatal 
preferred terms (≥2% event rate) were death (29.7%), disease progression (10.4%), plasma cell myeloma 
(7.2%), pneumonia and sepsis (3.5% each), septic shock (2.4%), and infection (2.1%). 
Overall, review of post-marketing spontaneous reports did not identify any new safety signal. 
rHuPH20:  rHuPH20  is  the  active  ingredient  of  Halozyme’s  commercial  product  Hylenex  recombinant 
(hyaluronidase human injection), hereafter referred to as HYLENEX, which was approved in December 2005 
by FDA for marketing in the U.S. HYLENEX is a tissue permeability modifier indicated as an adjuvant in SC 
fluid  administration  for  achieving  hydration,  to  increase  the  dispersion  and  absorption  of  other  injected 
drugs, and in SC urography, for improving resorption of radiopaque agents (HYLENEX PI 2016). 
The cumulative patient exposure to HYLENEX from December 2005 to 16 November 2019 is estimated to 
be approximately 2,504,064 based on the total number of vials distributed less those returned, and on the 
presumed dose of 150 U rHuPH20 per treated patient. In addition, a total of 1,592 clinical study subjects 
are  known  to  have  been  exposed  to  HYLENEX  and  other  rHuPH20  drug  products  in  30  clinical  studies 
conducted under the HYLENEX Investigational New Drug (IND) 66,888 or in post-marketing Phase 4 studies. 
A review of safety information for HYLENEX from the Periodic Safety Update Report reporting period from 
16 November 2018 to 15 November 2019 did not identify any new significant safety issues for HYLENEX 
and other rHuPH20 drug products from post-marketing safety reports. 
Further, the safety findings from clinical studies completed during the reporting period were consistent with 
the known safety profile for HYLENEX and other rHuPH20 drug products. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
For  this  application,  the  safety  of  daratumumab  SC  (DARZALEX)  in  combination  with  CyBorD 
(cyclophosmamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone) in subjects with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis is based 
on  results  from  the  Phase  3  Study  AMY3001.  Safety  data  and  exposure  were  evaluated  in  the  Safety 
Analysis Set, which included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 administration of any study 
treatment.  The  clinical  cut-off  date  was  14  February  2020.  Safety  analyses  were  based  on  the  safety 
analysis population, which included subjects treated in the Safety Run-in and randomized parts of the study. 
There  were  193  and  188  subjects  treated  with  daratumumab  SC+CyBorD  or  CyBorD,  respectively.  Per  
protocol,  subjects  in  the  CyBorD  arm  were  to  receive  up to  a  maximum  of  6 cycles  of  study  treatment. 
Whereas, subjects in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm were to receive combination therapy for up to 6 
cycles,  followed  by  daratumumab  SC  monotherapy  after  Cycle  6  until  disease  progression,  start  of 
subsequent therapy, or up to a maximum of 24 cycles (~2 years) from the first dose of study treatment.  
The enrolled population was considered adequate and representative for the target population. The median 
follow-up for this study was 11.4 months. 
As  reflected  in  the  SmPC,  the  safety  of  daratumumab  SC  (1,800  mg)  has  been  evaluated  in  total  490 
patients  with  multiple  myeloma.  The  data  shows  exposure  to  daratumumab  subcutaneous  formulation 
(1,800  mg)  in  490  patients  with  multiple  myeloma  (MM)  including  260  patients  from  a  Phase  III  active 
controlled  trial  (Study  MMY3012)  who  received  daratumumab  solution  for  subcutaneous  injection  as 
monotherapy  and three open label,  clinical  studies in  which  patients  received daratumumab  solution  for 
subcutaneous  injection  either  as  monotherapy  (N=31,  MMY1004  and  MMY1008)  and  MMY2040  in  which 
patients received daratumumab solution for subcutaneous injection in combination with either bortezomib, 
melphalan and prednisone (D VMP, n=67), lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D Rd, n=65) or bortezomib, 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D VRd, n=67).

All 28 patients in the Safety Run-in cohort had 1 or more TEAEs, and 75% had 1 or more Grade 3 or 4 
TEAEs  and  nearly  all  patients  in  study  AMY3001  in  both  treatment  arms  had  at  least  1  TEAE  reported. 
Twelve  patients  (42.9%)  experienced  serious  TEAEs,  however,  no  subjects  discontinued  treatment  or 
withdrew  from  the  study  due  to  an  AE.  Serious  TEAEs  were  reported  for  more  than  1  (3.6%)  patient 
including cellulitis and pneumonia (7.1% each) and fall and kidney injury (10.7% each). 
Due to study design of AMY3001, the median duration of study treatment was nearly 2-fold longer in the 
daratumumab SC-CyBorD arm (9.6 months) than the CyBorD arm (5.3 months). The median number of 
treatment cycles received was 11 (range: 1-23) for the daratumumab SC-CyBorD arm and 6 (range: 1-6) 
for the CyBorD arm. Among patients receiving daratumumab SC-CyBorD, 74.1% were exposed ≥6 months 
and 32.1% were exposed >1 year. Among patients receiving CyBorD, 3.7% were exposed ≥6 months and 
no subjects were exposed >1 year. The median total dose of the chemotherapy during the treatment course 
was well balanced in the two arms with slightly higher dose in the daratumumab arm in cycle 3-6 due to 
more patients in the CyBorD arm discontinuing study treatment. The extent of exposure of individual study 
agents was as well balanced in the two arms. 
Nearly  all  patients  (SC+CyBorD:  97.9%,  CyBorD:  98.4%)  in  both  treatment  arms  had  at  least  1  TEAE 
reported (Table 39). TEAEs related to either type of chemotherapy is balanced between the 2 arms with 
falling incidence from cycle 7+ in the SC+CyBorD arm (Table 40).   
Grade  3  and  4  TEAEs  were  reported  for  ≥10%  of  patients  including  fatigue  (21.4%),  lymphopenia 
(17.9%), diarrhoea, anemia, and peripheral oedema (14.3% each, and pneumonia and fall (10.7%). The 
incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs was balanced between the treatment arms during Cycles 1-2 and the most 
common (>2%) Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs from Cycle 7 onwards were Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders 
followed  by  Infections  and  Infestations,  Cardiac  Disorders,  and  Respiratory,  Thoracic  and  Mediastinal 
Disorders. By preferred term the incidence was for all ≤3.4%. 
Adverse  events  of  special  interest  include  IRR  of  which  7.3%  of  patients  experienced  this.  The 
incidence, preferred terms, severity, and onset of IRRs were consistent with those previously reported for 
daratumumab  SC.  Grade  3  or  4  TEAEs  of  opportunistic  infections  were  low  in  both  treatment  arms. 
There was no pattern regarding the specific preferred terms of infections and infestations associated with 
the use of daratumumab SC. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was higher in the daratumumab 
SC+CyBorD  arm  (22.0%  vs  14.7%)  during  Cycles  3-6.  The  incidence  of  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy 
subsequently decreased significantly from Cycle 7 onwards in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm to 8.7%, 
however  Daratumumab  may  increase  peripheral  neuropathy  induced  by  background  therapy  with 
bortezomib (very commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy) and the disease associated neuropathy, 
the  additional  neurotoxicity  that  can  be  added  by  daratumumab  could  lead  to  a  worse  QoL.    Based  on 
available and limited (few patients) data, baseline involvement seemed not to impact the risk of peripheral 
neuropathy  on  study  treatment.  The  incidence  of  cardiac  disorders  All  Grades  was  higher  in  the 
daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm (32.6% vs 21.8%), but the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 was similar in the two 
arms (11.4% and 9.6%, respectively) and the majority of treatment-emergent cardiac SAEs occurred in 
patients with baseline cardiac involvement. The majority of patients (54/55) reported baseline cardiac Stage 
II or Stage III; and 46/55 patients reported baseline NYHA Class II or Class IIIA (TSFAE05P). These data 
suggest that most of these cardiac-related deaths are attributable to the underlying AL amyloidosis-related 
cardiomyopathy.  A  multicenter  prospective  study  of  daratumumab-based  therapy  in  patients  with  newly 
diagnosed AL amyloidosis will be conducted (please see RMP section below) in order to further characterise 
cardiac  adverse  events  in  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  AL  amyloidosis  treated  with  subcutaneous 
daratumumab-based therapy in terms of the incidence, severity, clinical presentation, management, and 
outcome.  It  will  also  investigate  the  use  in  patients  with  AL  amyloidosis  who  have  pre-existing  serious 
cardiac involvement. 
The MAH presented further results regarding patients who had renal disorders before initiation of treatment 
Assessment report

which showed that patients with renal disorders at baseline are more prone to develop AEs but the observed 
differences  in  frequencies  of  reported  AEs  between  treatment  arms  did  not  reveal  a  clinically  relevant 
pattern.    
More patients in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm (11.9%) died due to an AE during study compared to 
the CyBorD arm (7.4%). Deaths due to AE within 30 days of last study treatment were reported for 10.4% 
of  patients  in  the  daratumumab  SC+CyBorD  arm  and  7.4%  of  patients  in  the  CyBorD  arm.  The  most 
common (≥2% in either treatment arm) AEs leading to death were cardiac disorders. All patients who died 
due to cardiac disorders had cardiac involvement at baseline. There were more fatal AEs reported in the 
daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm along with a longer median duration of exposure. At the primary cut-off, 
the number of reported deaths were similar (27 vs 29) between the arms and with longer follow up, fewer 
deaths were reported in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm compared with the CyBorD arm (31 vs 41).  
More patients in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent SAE compared 
with  the  CyBorD  arm  (43.0%  vs  36.2%).  The  most  commonly  reported  treatment-emergent  SAEs  were 
pneumonia and cardiac failure/cardiac failure congestive combined. 
Laboratory findings: The worst toxicity grades were balanced between the two arms regarding anemia, 
thrombocytopenia  and  leukopenia  except  a  higher  level  of  Grade  4  neutropenia  in  the  daratumumab 
SC+CyBorD  arm  compared  with  the  CyBorD  arm  (3.2%  vs  0%),  suggesting  that  daratumumab  may 
increase neutropenia induced by background therapy. However, the incidence of any grade cytopenia was 
higher  in  subjects  with  low  body  weight.  This  did  not  lead  to  a  higher  frequency  of  infections  or 
discontinuation of study treatment compared to those with higher body weight and these cytopenias did 
not lead to differences in tolerability or clinically meaningful AEs in either treatment arm. Dose modifications 
would therefore not be required.  
Since the incidence of any grade cytopenia was higher in subjects with low body weight the MAH was asked 
to determine whether dose modifications may be required in this patient population. The MAH provided a 
comparison of observed daratumumab exposures across body weight subgroups and, overall, the results 
of  the  exposure-safety  analyses  show  that  there  is  no  apparent  relationship  between  daratumumab  SC 
exposure, based on Cpeak,max,  and the rate of cytopenia in subjects with amyloidosis. Additionally, the 
MAH states that even though the incidence of any grade cytopenia was higher in subjects with low body 
weight (<65 kg), this did not lead to a higher frequency of infections or discontinuation of study treatment 
compared  to  those  with  higher  body  weight.  The  MAH  also  notes  that  these  cytopenias  did  not  lead  to 
differences in tolerability or clinically meaningful AEs in either treatment arm. Taking the above into account 
the MAH considers that 1800 mg daratumumab SC dose regimen is expected to show similar benefit-risk 
profile  across  all  bodyweight  subgroups  in  subjects  with  AL  amyloidosis  and  suggests  that  dose 
modifications would not be required. This was considered acceptable.  
The incidence of any grade and Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were 
low. 
Available  post-marketing  data  have  been  submitted  and  no  notable  differences  in  the  safety  profile  of 
daratumumab SC compared to daratumumab IV have been observed. Spontaneous post-marketing case 
review did not identify new safety signals. The results suggested that the post-marketing drug safety profile 
of daratumumab SC is consistent with the known safety profile of daratumumab IV as a single agent or in 
combination therapy in multiple myeloma which support the use of SC daratumumab in this new indication.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile of  SC  daratumumab  in  combination  with  CyBorD  or  as  single  agent  in  AL  amyloidosis 
patients is as observed when used in the indication for multiple myeloma patients. The level of observed 
Assessment report

AEs is considered acceptable and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were low. Cardiac 
involvement at baseline which is an adverse event of interest in amyloidosis patients was present in the 
majority of patients in both treatment arms, and the majority of treatment-emergent cardiac SAEs occurred 
in  patients  with  baseline  cardiac  involvement.  Data  suggest  that  most  of  the  cardiac-related  deaths  are 
attributable to the underlying AL amyloidosis-related cardiomyopathy. There are no new safety findings, no 
new  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  nor  any  major  concerns.  A  multicenter  prospective  study  of 
daratumumab-based  therapy  in  patients  with newly  diagnosed  AL  amyloidosis will  be  conducted  (please 
see  RMP  section  below)  in  order  to  further  charactersze  cardiac  adverse  events  in  patients  with  newly 
diagnosed  AL  amyloidosis  treated  with  subcutaneous  daratumumab-based  therapy  in  terms  of  the 
incidence,  severity,  clinical  presentation,  management,  and  outcome.  It  will  also  investigate  the  use  in 
patients with AL amyloidosis who have pre-existing serious cardiac involvement. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle set in the EURD list entry of daratumumab does not need to be amended, based on the 
data submitted in the application, as no new safety findings, no new adverse drug reactions (ADRs) nor 
any major concerns were identified. 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c (7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing additional user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• 
Full user testing in compliance with the above-mentioned legislative requirements was performed 
(n=20  participants)  on  the  package  leaflet  developed  for  DARZALEX  for  the  initial  Marketing 
Authorisation Application. 
•  An additional user testing (n= 10 participants) was conducted for a bridging report on the package 
leaflet developed for the Line extension Application of the DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation. 
• 
The package leaflet included in this current application has the same format as the one previously 
approved. 
•  With  the  currently  proposed  indication  extension,  minimal  changes  have  been  introduced  to  the 
package leaflet and the proposed changes reflect language and a format that is consistent with that 
in the currently approved leaflet for the subcutaneous formulation. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Systemic  AL  amyloidosis  is  a  rare  and  incurable  malignant  plasma  cell  disorder  characterized  by  clonal 
expansion of CD38+ plasma cells and extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrillar proteins in tissues and 
organs  affecting  the  normal  hematopoiesis  as  well  as  different  organs,  especially  the  heart  and  kidney, 
resulting  in  serious  and  life-threatening  organ  dysfunction.  The  incidence  of  the  disease  is  estimated 
between 3 and 12 cases per million persons per year, and an estimated prevalence of 30 000 to 45 000 AL 
amyloidosis patients in the United States and the European Union. The majority of patients are over the 
age of 65 years (Nienhuis et al 2016, Quock et al. 2018). Amyloidosis has a poor prognosis as the median 
survival  without  treatment  is  13  months  from  diagnosis  (Sanchorawala  2007,  Chaulagain  2013). 
Approximately one-third of patients die largely due to cardiac involvement within the first year of diagnosis. 
Cardiac  involvement  has  the  worst  prognosis  and  results  in  death  in  about  6  months  after  onset  of 
congestive heart failure. Only 5% of the patients with primary amyloidosis survive beyond 10 years. Almost 
one  third  of  patients  with  renal  involvement  progress  to  dialysis.  The  involvement  of  other  organs,  e.g. 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021 
Page 110/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
liver,  gastrointestinal  tract  and  peripheral  and  autonomic  nerves,  contributes  to  significant  chronic 
morbidity and mortality, such that the OS rate at 2 years is only 60% (Muchtar 2017; Wechalekar 2015). 
The agreed indication is the following: “DARZALEX is indicated in combination with cyclophosphamide, 
bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed systemic light 
chain (AL) amyloidosis.” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
No  regimen  has  been  approved  for  amyloidosis  (Wechalekar  2015)  and  no  optimal  treatment  has  been 
identified (Anderson 2014, NCCN). 
As both AL amyloidosis and Multiple Myeloma (MM) are clonal plasma cell disorders, the treatment approach 
is to use MM regimens. Eradicating the clonal plasma cell in AL amyloidosis eliminates the production of the 
light chain that is both amyloidogenic and proteotoxic leading to organ failure. Despite this, there are key 
differences in the efficacy and safety between these 2 populations. The achievement of a rapid and deep 
hematologic response is the essential goal of therapy in AL amyloidosis and an indicator for clinical outcome. 
The  depth  of  hematologic  response  is  associated  with  organ  improvement  and  survival  (Palladini  2012, 
Kastritis  2020).  Thus,  the  goal  of  therapy  for  patients  with  AL  amyloidosis  is  to  achieve  complete 
hematologic response (CHR) or at a minimum very good partial response (VGPR) in order to prevent further 
end-organ damage, reverse existing organ dysfunction, and prolong OS (Chaulagain 2013, Merlini 2018). 
In AL amyloidosis, achieving a partial hematologic response or stable disease may not offer a clinical benefit, 
because ongoing light chain production may result in further organ damage. 
The  entire  armamentarium  of  multiple  myeloma  regimens  has  been  used  in  AL  amyloidosis.  The  use  of 
CyBorD is recommended by the NCCN and consensus guidelines (Comenzo 2012, Anderson 2014; Mahmood 
2014,  Wechalekar  2008),  and  it  is  now  the  preferred  regimen  for  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  and 
relapsed AL amyloidosis due to the limited feasibility and high mortality rate of HDM/ASCT, and the cardiac 
and renal toxicities associated with IMiDs and other combinations (D’Souza 2015). 
Thalidomide and lenalidomide-based regimens are associated with severe toxicities including bradycardia, 
syncope, and renal failure (Merlini 2018). Carfilzomib is known to be associated with severe cardiac toxicity 
in  multiple  myeloma  and  is  prohibitively  toxic  in  AL  amyloidosis  (Waxman  2018;  Cohen  2016). 
Lenalidomide-containing regimens have been used in AL amyloidosis with similar results as thalidomide-
containing regimens. The overall hematologic response rate for lenalidomide-based regimens has been 46% 
with  a  CHR  of  25%  (Cibeira  2015).  Although  lenalidomide  is  associated  with  lower  rates  of  peripheral 
neuropathy than thalidomide, it is also a challenging drug in AL amyloidosis. 
Most  studies  in  AL  amyloidosis  have  been  retrospective  or  small  uncontrolled  studies.  The  largest 
retrospective  cohort  of  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  AL  amyloidosis  reported  for  CyBorD  an  overall 
response  rate  (OrRR,  PR  or  better)  of  62%  (125/201  patients  with  measurable  disease)  compared  with 
100%  in  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  patients.  Additionally,  HemCR  was  reported  in  21%  (42 
patients)  and  VGPR  in  22%  (45  patients).  Cardiac  response  was  achieved  in 17%  of  the patients,  while 
renal response was observed in 25% of the patients (Kumar 2012; Palladini 2015). 
High-dose melphalan and ASCT demonstrate a high efficacy profile; however, only a minority of patients 
are candidates (~20%) and it is associated with much higher treatment-related mortality 5-24% compared 
to 1% for multiple myeloma (Jaccard 2007; D’Souza 2015). In long-term data out of 701 patients evaluated 
at the Boston Amyloidosis Center 394 (56%) were deemed eligible for transplant and 312 patients were 
treated with HDM/ASCT (Skinner 2004) while the CHR rate was 40% and the transplant-related mortality 
was 13%. The organ response rate at 1-year post-transplant among those who achieved a CHR was 27% 
for cardiac and 63% for renal (NCCN 2019). 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021

In conclusion, the MM regimens demonstrate similar or lower hematologic responses in AL amyloidosis but 
are associated with higher rates of toxicity, and although CyBorD is currently considered the standard of 
care, certain subgroups like cardiac Stage III, high dFLC (>180 mg/L) and t(11;14) continue to have dismal 
outcomes. Thus, a substantial unmet medical need exists for therapies in AL amyloidosis, that can provide 
clinical efficacy translating into survival benefits at a lower toxicity. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  current  marketing  application  includes  one  pivotal  randomized  open-label  phase  3  study  for  newly 
diagnosed AL amyloidosis: 
•  Study AMY3001 is a randomized phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daratumumab 
SC  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide,  bortezomib  and dexamethasone  (CyBorD)  compared 
with CyBorD alone in newly diagnosed systemic AL amyloidosis 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  addition  of  daratumumab  SC  to  CyBorD  resulted  in  a  CHR  of  53.3%  compared  with  18.1%  in  the 
CyBorD arm, odds ratio [95% CI] =5.13 (3.22, 8.16); p<0.0001 with a median of 11.4 months follow-up, 
which is considered highly clinically meaningful in a group of patients newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with 
organ involvement. The CHR results were consistent among all pre-planned sensitivity analysis and across 
different clinically relevant prespecified subgroups and the pre-planned stratification factors (cardiac stage, 
renal function and whether countries offer ASCT or not) in favour of the daratumumabSC + CyBorD arm 
compared with the CyBorD arm. 
The VGPR or better rate, was 78.5% significantly higher in the Dara SC + CyBorD group compared with 
49.2% for CyBorD alone. (Odds ratio 3.75; 95% CI:2.40, 5.85; p< 0.0001).  
Subjects  may  switch  to,  subsequent  non-cross  resistant,  anti-plasma  cell  therapy  due  to  insufficient 
hematologic response or aggravating organ function. The median MOD-EFS was 8.8 months for the CyBorD 
arm,  but  not  reached  in  the  dara  SC+CyBorD  arm  (HR=0.39;  95%  CI:  0.27,  0.56;  nominal  p-value 
<0.0001). 
The median time to response (≥VGPR) was short in both treatment arms (D- CyBorD: 17 days; CyBorD: 
25 days). CHR was reached faster in the D-CyBorD arm compared with the CyBorD arm (median time to 
CHR: 60 days vs. 85 days, respectively). 
The responses were durable: with a median follow-up of 11.4 months, the median duration of CHR (DoP) 
has not been reached in either treatment groups which is reassuring.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The planned ‘treatment until progression’ is the general strategy in multiple myeloma. There is, however, 
the remaining uncertainty about whether shorter duration of daratumumab maintenance (e.g. less than 2 
years) could lead to similar outcomes, particularly in patients achieving deep responses.   
Although  subgroup  analyses  of  CHR  were  consistent  with  the  overall  population  for  the  pre-specified 
subgroups  in  favour  of  the  dara  SC+  CyBorD  arm  vs.  the  CyBorD  arm,  in  general  interpretation  of  the 
results in the subgroups are hampered by the small sample size.  
Overall  survival  data  were  not  mature  at  the  time  of  the  clinical  data  cut-off  with  few  events  having 
occurred.  Even  if  there  seems  to  be  a  reasonably  well  established  association  between  complete 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021 
Page 112/119 
 
 
 
 
haematological  response  and  long-term  outcomes  (MOD-PFS  and  OS),  OS  data  are  still  of  noticeable 
importance in the intended treatment setting and the MAH will provide the primary and final analyses of 
OS as a post-authorisation efficacy study. Of note, OS data reported after further 9 months of follow-up 
(13/11/2020) were still immature but thus far do not suggest a detrimental effect of dara SC + CyBorD on 
OS.  Besides  published  data  indicate  that  55%  of  subjects  with  newly  diagnosed  AL  amyloidosis  were 
projected to survive 5 years. 
Although  the  Kaplan-Meier  curves  for  MOD-PFS  separates  after  6.5  months,  the  results  for  the  dara 
SC+CyBorD compared with CyBorD alone are not statistically significant, and the data are not mature with 
only 43% of the 200 planned events at the time of analysis. Despite MOD-PFS is not a standard acceptable 
endpoint in AL amyloidosis, it may be of value from a clinical point of view. However, the IPW method used 
is regarded as hypothetical, indicating the results should be considered exploratory.  
The odds ratio for standard risk cytogenetics favoured the dara SC+CYBorD arm, but no conclusion can be 
drawn  on  cytogenetic  high-risk  subjects.  Analysing  poor  prognostic  groups:  the  presence  of  t(11;14) 
analysed by FISH, Cardiac stage III and dFLC > 180 mg/L indicated a trend towards a beneficial effect of 
the  Dara  SC+CyBorD  arm  compared  with  CyBorD,  however,  the  interpretation  of  the  results  in  the 
subgroups  are  hampered  by  the  small  sample  size  and  no  statistically  significant  difference  could  be 
demonstrated. 
A trend towards improvement of cardiac – and renal 6-month response was noted, although no statistically 
significant difference could be demonstrated. 
The addition of daratumumab to CyBorD does not have an impact on patient's health-related quality of life 
as assessed by patient-reported outcomes (PROs). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs of opportunistic infections were low in both treatment arms. There was no pattern 
regarding the specific preferred terms of infections and infestations associated with the use of daratumumab 
SC. 
The incidence of any grade and Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were 
low. 
Overall there are no new safety findings, no new adverse drug reactions (ADRs) nor any major concerns. 
Grade  3  and  4  TEAEs  were  reported  for  ≥10%  of  patients  including  fatigue  (21.4%),  lymphopenia 
(17.9%), diarrhoea, anaemia, and peripheral oedema (14.3% each), and pneumonia and fall (10.7%). 
Adverse events of special interest include IRR of which 7.3% of patients experienced this. The incidence 
of peripheral neuropathy was higher in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD  arm (22.0% vs 14.7%) during 
Cycles 3-6. The incidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy subsequently decreased significantly from Cycle 
7 onwards in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm to 8.7%, however daratumumab may increase peripheral 
neuropathy induced by background therapy, as reflected in the SmPC. The incidence of cardiac disorders 
All Grades was higher in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm (32.6% vs 21.8%), but the incidence of Grade 
3 or 4 was similar in the two arms (11.4% and 9.6%, respectively) and the majority of treatment-emergent 
cardiac SAEs occurred in patients with baseline cardiac involvement. 
The incidence of any grade cytopenia was higher in subjects with low body weight. However, this did not 
lead to a higher frequency of infections or discontinuation of study treatment compared to those with higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/433036/2021 
Page 113/119 
 
 
 
 
 
body  weight  and  the  cytopenias  did  not  lead  to  differences  in  tolerability  or  clinically  meaningful  AEs  in 
either treatment arm.  
More patients in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm (11.9%) died due to an AE during study compared to 
the CyBorD arm (7.4%). Deaths due to AE within 30 days of last study treatment were reported for 10.4% 
of  patients  in  the  daratumumab  SC+CyBorD  arm  and  7.4%  of  patients  in  the  CyBorD  arm.  The  most 
common (≥2% in either treatment arm) AEs leading to death were cardiac disorders. All patients who died 
due to cardiac disorders had cardiac involvement at baseline.  
More patients in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent SAE compared 
with  the  CyBorD  arm  (43.0%  vs  36.2%).  The  most  commonly  reported  treatment-emergent  SAEs  were 
pneumonia and cardiac failure/cardiac failure congestive combined. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Peripheral neuropathy was higher in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm suggesting that daratumumab 
may  increase  peripheral  neuropathy  by  background  therapy.  Cardiac  disorders  were  higher  in  the 
daratumumab arm even though the majority of SAEs occurred in patients with baseline cardiac involvement. 
More deaths due to AE within 30 days were seen in the daratumumab arm. However, at the primary cut-
off, the number of reported deaths were similar (27 vs 29) between the arms and with longer follow up, 
fewer deaths were reported in the daratumumab SC+CyBorD arm compared with the CyBorD arm (31 vs 
41).  
Further safety characterisation of relevant patient subgroups (e.g. those 75 years of age or older, 65 years 
plus  important  comorbidities  and/or  poor  performance  status)  is  needed  for  a  more  complete 
characterisation of the safety profile of the proposed combination in the intended indication. 
A multicenter prospective study of daratumumab-based therapy in patients with newly diagnosed AL 
amyloidosis will be conducted (please see RMP section) in order to further characterise cardiac adverse 
events in patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis treated with subcutaneous daratumumab-based 
therapy in terms of the incidence, severity, clinical presentation, management, and outcome. It will also 
investigate the use in patients with AL amyloidosis who have pre-existing serious cardiac involvement.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Light  chain  (AL)  amyloidosis  is  a  rare  disease  associated  with  significant  morbidity  and  mortality.  The 
prognosis is in general dismal, not only due to the effect on the bone marrow, but also the extent of organ 
involvement. The goal of therapy in AL amyloidosis is achievement of a rapid and deep CHR, which has 
been demonstrated to be associated with organ improvement and better survival. No regimen has been 
approved  for  amyloidosis,  and  no  optimal  treatment  has  been  identified.  Different  multiple  myeloma

regimens have demonstrated similar or lower hematologic responses in AL amyloidosis compared with the 
treatment of multiple myeloma. But they are in general associated with higher rates of toxicity. The use of 
CyBorD is recommended by the NCCN and consensus guidelines, and it is now the preferred regimen for 
patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed AL amyloidosis due to the cardiac and renal toxicities associated 
with IMiDs and other combinations. Despite this, a substantial unmet medical need exists for therapies in 
AL amyloidosis, that can provide clinical efficacy translating into survival benefits at a lower toxicity. The 
availability of a novel therapy with a new mechanism of action, targeting CD38+ plasma cells added to the 
traditionally used backbone therapy is interesting.  
An overall CHR rate of 53.1% in the dara SC+CyBorD arm compared with 18.1% in the CyBorD arm (odds 
ratio=5.13; 95% CI: 3.22, 8.16; p<0.0001) is therefore considered clinically relevant and meaningful in 
this group of newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with organ involvement. A significant beneficial and clinically 
meaningful  effect  was  shown  on  overall  CHR  and  VGPR  or  better,  higher  than  when  compared  with  the 
backbone  therapy  alone  in  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  AL  amyloidosis  in  study  AMY3001.  Of  note, 
however, OS data are still immature and although thus far do not suggest a detrimental effect of dara SC 
+ CyBorD on OS. Provision of final OS data is considered key to benefit risk. In this regard the MAH will 
provide the primary and final analyses of OS from study AMY3001 as a post-authorisation efficacy study. 
The MAH has narrowed the indication to include adults with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with a backbone 
regimen of CyBorD, which is considered acceptable.   
The  proposed  dosing  regimen  of  subcutaneous  daratumumab  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide, 
bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with AL amyloidosis is considered adequate.  
The safety profile is in general as expected in the context of the patient population, the backbone therapy 
and the known safety profile of daratumumab SC. Overall there are no new safety findings or new adverse 
drug  reactions,  although  daratumumab  may  increase  peripheral  neuropathy  induced  by  background 
therapy.  The  incidence  of  cardiac  disorders  was  higher  in  the  daratumumab  SC+CyBorD  arm,  but  no 
difference was noted for Grade 3 or 4 and the majority of treatment-emergent cardiac SAEs occurred in 
patients  with  baseline  cardiac  involvement.  The  MAH  plans  to  conduct  a  multicenter,  prospective  study 
(overall  duration  of  the  study,  including  recruitment  and  follow-up,  is  anticipated  to  be  approximately  5 
years (by Q3 2025)) of daratumumab-based therapy in newly diagnosed patients with AL amyloidosis, in 
which they will characterise cardiac AEs in terms of incidence, severity, clinical presentation, management, 
and outcome (including non-fatal myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, arrhythmia, as well as fatal cardiac 
events and events of sudden death (please see RMP section). Management and outcome of major cardiac 
events, including hospitalisations will also be analysed). The use of this study is considered appropriate and 
will allow to collect further data on the safety profile of daratumumab in patients with AL amyloidosis who 
have the most advanced cardiac disease (NYHA Class IIIB and IV cardiac disease). The MAH has committed 
to  submit the  study  protocol  for  PRAC  assessment  within  3  months  after  the  CHMP  positive opinion.  No 
difference in number of infections or discontinuation due to adverse events was reported. No difference in 
number of infections or discontinuation due to adverse events was reported.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Daratumumab added to standard backbone therapy, cyclofosfamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone has 
a favourable benefit/risk profile in patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis and one or more organ 
involvement. The benefit/risk balance is considered positive.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The following measure is considered necessary as an Annex II condition to address issues related to 
efficacy. It is imposed on the grounds that  the initial efficacy assessment is based on surrogate 
endpoints, which requires verification of the impact of the intervention on clinical outcome or disease 
progression or confirmation of previous efficacy assumptions. 
Description 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further evaluate the efficacy of 
subcutaneous daratumumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib 
and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed 
systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis, the MAH should submit the final OS results of 
the AMY3001 study.

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification by 
04 June 2021. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA website 
at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-agencies/european-
medicines-agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-confidential-information_en.pdf 
In addition, should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains personal data, please 
provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of these data in “track changes” and 
with detailed justification by 04 June 2021. We would like to remind you that, according to Article 
4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) ‘personal data’ 
means any information, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the ‘data subject’). 
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by 
reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online 
identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, 
cultural or social identity of that natural person. 
It is important to clarify that pseudonymised data are also considered personal data. According to 
Article 4(5) of GDPR pseudonymisation means that personal data is processed in a manner that the 
personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional 
information (e.g. key-coded data).  
Accordingly, the name and the patient identification number are two examples of personal data 
which may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass for 
instance: office e-mail address or phone number of a company, data concerning health, e.g. 
information in medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which relates to an identifiable 
individual.” 
2. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after the 
Commission Decision, if there will be one within 2 months from adoption of the CHMP Opinion, or 
prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. If the Commission Decision will be adopted 
within 12 months from CHMP Opinion, the closing sequence should be submitted within 30 days 
after the Opinion. For additional guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised Technical Guidance for 
eCTD Submissions in the EU. 
3. 
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the 
RMP ‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the MAH 
is reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the ‘Part VI: 
Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar days of the 
receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free of metadata, 
headers and footers.

2  Scientific discussion 
2.1  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Using  a  threshold  of  140/90  mmHg,  about  40%  of  the  adult  population  in  many  EU  countries  have 
raised  blood  pressure  although  the  proportion  increases  with  age.  Hypertension  may  often  be 
inadequately  treated  and  is  a  contributory  factor  in  cardiovascular  diseases  which  account  for 
considerable proportion of all deaths and hospital bed days. 
In  most  hypertensive  patients,  pharmacological  intervention  becomes  necessary  if  blood  pressure 
lowering is to be substantial and sustainable. Available evidence demonstrates firmly that a sustained 
reduction  in  blood  pressure  by  drugs  reduces  the  incidence  of  stroke,  coronary  heart  disease  and 
overall  mortality.  For  an  individual  at  any  age,  the  greater  the  cardiovascular  risk  the  greater  the 
potential to benefit from treatment. 
Most  individuals  who  suffer  raised  blood  pressure  (around  95%)  have  essential  (or  primary) 
hypertension  with  no  identifiable  cause.  Around  5%  of  individuals  with  raised  blood  pressure  have 
secondary  hypertension,  where  renal  disease,  pulmonary  disease,  endocrine  complications,  or  other 
diseases underlie raised blood pressure. 
For  a  long  time,  hypertension  guidelines  focused  on  blood  pressure  values  as  the  only  or  main 
variables determining the need and the type of treatment. The more recent CHMP guidance on “Clinical 
investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of  hypertension”  (CPMP/EWP/238/95  Rev.  3) 
emphasizes that diagnosis and management of hypertension should be related to quantification of total 
cardiovascular  risk.  This  concept  is  based  on  the  fact  that  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  hypertensive 
population  has  an  elevation  of  blood  pressure  alone,  with  the  great  majority  exhibiting  additional 
cardiovascular risk factors, with a relationship between the severity of the blood pressure elevation and 
that  of  alterations  in  glucose  and  lipid  metabolism.  Some  evidence  is  available  that  in  high  risk 
individuals thresholds and goals for antihypertensive treatment, as well as other treatment strategies, 
should be different from those to be implemented in lower risk individuals. 
Several  classes  of  antihypertensive  medicines  are  available.  However,  sooner  or  later,  most  of  the 
patients end up using combination therapy, as monotherapy is unable to control their blood pressure. 
A need for new well tolerated potent antihypertensive agents is therefore undisputed. 
About the product 
TAK-491  (azilsartan  medoxomil)  is  the  prodrug  of  the  active  moiety,  TAK-536  (azilsartan),  a  potent 
and  selective  antagonist  of  angiotensin  II  (AII)  type  1  (AT1)  receptors  (an  AII  receptor  blocker,  or 
ARB).    After  oral  administration,  TAK-491  is  rapidly  converted  to  TAK-536  by  ester  hydrolysis  in  the 
gut  and/or  during  the  process  of  absorption.  TAK-536  has  high  affinity  for  AT1  receptors  and  is 
>10,000-fold more selective for AT1 receptors compared with AII type 2 (AT2) receptors in vitro.  
TAK-491 reduced blood pressure in animal models of hypertension after acute and repeat oral dosing. 
Non-clinical results demonstrate that TAK-536 has a much slower dissociation from AT1 receptors than 
the other AT1 antagonists (olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan, and irbesartan).

The  Applicant  is  seeking  a  Marketing  Authorisation  for  TAK-491  tablets  (20,  40,  and  80  mg)  for  the 
once-daily treatment of essential hypertension in adults, either as monotherapy or in combination with 
other antihypertensive agents.  
The  recommended  starting  dose  is  40  mg  taken  once  daily  and  this  dose  may  be  increased  to  a 
maximum  of  80  mg  once  daily  for  patients  whose  blood  pressure  is  not  adequately  controlled  at  the 
lower  dose.  A  20  mg  dose  once  daily  can  be  considered  as  a  starting  dose  for  patients  at  risk  of 
hypotension. 
The  primary objective  of  the  TAK-491  development  programme  was  to  develop  a  more  effective  ARB 
compared with those currently approved with a safety profile similar to that of available therapies. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This  Marketing  Authorisation  application  is  a full, stand  alone application in  accordance  with  Directive 
2001/83/EC Article 8 (3).  
The  development  programme  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  complies  with  the  CHMP  guidance  on  “Clinical 
investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of hypertension” (CPMP/EWP/238/95 Rev. 3). 
A  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (P/106/2010)  and  a  waiver  for  children  aged  below  6  months  of  age 
have  been  agreed  for  azilsartan  medoxomil  with  the  PDCO.  A  deferral  to  complete  the  PIP  has  been 
granted  until  April  2021.  During  the  evaluation,  a  modification  of  the  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan 
(P/39/2011)  and  of  the  waiver  now  for  children  below  1  year  of  age  was  agreed  for  azilsartan 
medoxomil with the PDCO. 
Scientific  advice  from  national  competent  authorities  was  obtained  on  several  occasions  during  the 
development  of  the  drug.  Regulatory  consultations  have  been  undertaken  with  agencies  in  Europe 
including the Medical Products Agency in Sweden (September 2008) and the Medicines and Healthcare 
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom (October 2008) during the early stages of 
the  phase  3  programme.  More  recently,  advice  was  sought  from  the  Federal  Institute  for  Drugs  and 
Medical  Devices  (BfArM)  in  Germany  (November  2009),  the  Agencia  Espanola  de  Medicamentos  y 
Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) in Spain (December 2009), and the Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) in 
the Netherlands (January 2010).

2.2.3  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  development  of  the  product  has  been  described,  the  choice  of  excipients  is  justified  and  their 
functions are explained. The compatibility of the active substance with excipients was evaluated. This 
resulted in the current formulation which was also used for the phase 3 clinical studies. 
The  goal  of  formulation  development  was  to  develop  an  orally  available,  robust  immediate  release 
formulation  with  good  stability  and  dissolution  characteristics.  With  consideration  to  the  desired  final 
market  presentation,  a  tablet  dosage  form  was  preferred  over  other  pharmaceutical  forms.  The 
formulation factors which may impact product quality were identified and classified. Each was assessed 
for its potential impact on quality attributes of the finished product. 
Commercial formulations are the same as phase 3 formulations except for tablet debossing. 
All  excipients  used  comply  with  the  current  requirements  specified  either  in  the  Ph.Eur.  The  chosen 
excipients  are:  mannitol  (diluents),  fumaric  acid  (pH  control),  sodium  hydroxide  (pH  control), 
hydroxypropyl  cellulose  (binder),  croscarmellose  sodium  (disintegrant),  mycrocystalline  cellulose 
(compressing aid), and magnesium stearate (lubricant) 
The  proposed  commercial  container  closure  system  for  the  product  intended  for  marketing  are 
aluminium  blisters  containing  forming  film  integrated  with  desiccant  and  aluminium  lidding.  Stability 
studies  showed  that  the  selected  blister  components  provide  adequate  product  protection  and  are 
compatible with the dosage form. 
Adventitious agents 
Magnesium  stearate  is  the  only  excipient  of  potential  animal  origin  used  in  the  manufacture,  it  is 
certified that the magnesium stearate is of plant origin only. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process has been adequately validated by a number of studies for the major steps 
of the manufacturing process in three commercial batches. 
The  batch  analysis  data  show  that  the  tablets  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly  according  to  the 
agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation 
Product specification 
The  product  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identity  (UV,  HPLC  or  UPLC),  related 
substances (HPLC or UPLC), assay (HPLC, or UPLC), dissolution, and uniformity of dosage units (HPLC 
or UPLC) 
The test and limits of the release and shelf life specification for the finished product are appropriate to 
control the quality of this medicinal product for the intended purpose. 
Batch data are provided for pilot and production batches and indicate satisfactory uniformity as well as 
compliance with the specification.

Stability of the product 
The stability of the product in three pilot batches of all strengths in the proposed commercial packages 
has  been  evaluated  in  a  series  of  studies  performed  under  conditions  representing  both  short-term 
stress  (40°C/75%RH)  for  6  months  and  long-term  storage  (25°C/60%RH  and  30°C/65%  RH  )  for  24 
months.  Additional  studies  performed  under  severe  stress  conditions  and  photostability  were  also 
performed on one selected batch.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay (HPLC, or UPLC), related substances (HPLC 
or UPLC), dissolution, moisture content, hardness, friability and microbiological examination. 
On the basis of the stability data available, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in 
the SPC are acceptable. 
2.2.4  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.3  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1  Introduction 
To  support  the  chronic  use  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  in  humans,  non-clinical  safety  studies  have  been 
conducted  on  TAK-491  (azilsartan  medoxomil),  TAK-536  (azilsartan),  TAK-536-MII  and  the  impurity 
TAK-491  U-3.  The  Applicant  conducted  a  very  comprehensive  non-clinical  development  programme 
beyond regulatory requirements. This programme is in general agreement with the applicable scientific 
guidelines.  
All  main  non-clinical  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  GLP.  In  addition,  non-GLP 
studies were conducted too but were not considered to compromise the scientific integrity or affect the 
experimental results. 
2.3.2  Pharmacology 
The pharmacology programme consisted of 29 studies and was considered to be adequate. The overall 
results of these studies are reported below. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamic in vitro 
The  results  of  the  in  vitro  receptor  binding  studies  clearly  demonstrated  that  TAK-536  is  a  highly 
potent,  selective  and  competitive  antagonist  of  the  angiotensin  II  type  1  receptor.  Although  full 
dissociation  kinetics  were  not  investigated,  results  of  a  washout  study  reveal  that  TAK-536  slowly

dissociates of the AT1 receptor when compared to the clinically used AT1 receptor blockers, suggesting 
that  the  duration  of  action  of  TAK-536  may  be  longer  lasting  than  other  AT1  receptor  blockers.  This 
effect was also observed in rats. The results of the indirect kinetic experiments (washout experiments) 
clearly  showed  that  azilsartan  slowly  dissociates  from  the  AT1  receptor  and  that  this  dissociation  is 
significantly  slower  compared  to  the  other  ARBs  tested.  In  addition,  results  of  additional  studies 
confirmed that azilsartan is an inverse agonist of the AT1 receptor.  
In  contrast  to  TAK-536,  its  metabolites  showed  weak  binding  affinity  for  the  AT1  receptor,  indicating 
that it is unlikely that these metabolites may contribute to the pharmacological functions of TAK-491. 
TAK-536  potently  and  selectively  inhibited  angiotensin  II-induced  vasoconstriction  of  isolated  rabbit 
aortic preparations. 
Primary pharmacodynamics in vivo 
The in vivo studies performed clearly demonstrated the antihypertensive effects of TAK-491 and TAK-
536.  In  various  hypertensive  models  in  rats  (angiotensin  II-induced  hypertensive,  spontaneously 
hypertensive,  renal  hypertensive  and  salt-dependent  hypertensive  rats  models)  and  dogs  (renal 
hypertensive  dogs  model)  oral  administration  of  TAK-491  and  TAK-536  significantly  reduced  blood 
pressure  in  a  dose  dependent  manner  without  producing  reflex  tachycardia  during  treatment  or 
rebound  hypertension  after  termination  of  treatment. At  doses ≥  0.1  mg/kg,  antihypertensive  effects 
persisted up to 24 hours. The potency and duration of the antihypertensive effects tended to increase 
with repeated dosing compared to single administration.  
In normotensive rats, TAK-536 increased renin concentrations but had no effect on blood pressure or 
aldosterone  levels.  However,  pre-treatment  of  normotensive  rats  with  TAK-536  inhibited  angiotensin 
II-induced  increases  in  blood  pressure  and  plasma  aldosterone  concentrations,  suggesting  that  the 
antihypertensive effects of TAK-536 observed in the other hypertensive models were derived form its 
specific antagonistic activity on angiotensin-mediated effects. The lack of efficacy for TAK-536 in salt-
dependent hypertensive rats supports the pharmacologic specificity of this compound on angiotensin II 
type 1 receptors.  
On  a  mg/kg  basis,  TAK-491  and  TAK-536  had  consistently  more  potent  and  longer  lasting 
antihypertensive  effects  than  the  clinically  used  angiotensin  II  receptor  blockers,  olmesartan  and 
losartan.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamics in vitro 
In addition to its effect on hypertension, angiotensin II plays a pivotal role in insulin resistance and this 
effect  too  appears  to  be  mediated  through  stimulation  of  the  angiotensin  II  type  I  receptor.  Hence, 
next to evaluating the primary antihypertensive effects and the potential off-target activity of TAK-491 
and TAK-536, the applicant examined the anti-diabetic activity of TAK-491 and TAK-536. 
Results of the various binding studies revealed that it is unlikely that TAK-491 will induce potential off-
target activity in human patients orally treated with clinical doses up to 80 mg.  
The  effects  of  TAK-536  on  IRS-1  phosphorylation  in  the  presence  of  insulin  and  angiotensin  II  were 
evaluated in rat primary skeletal muscle cells. Treatment of cells with TAK-536 significantly blocked the 
effects of angiotensin II and restored IRS-1 phosphorylation.

Secondary pharmacodynamics in vivo 
TAK-491 significantly inhibited the progression of albuminuria and proteinuria in a rat model of type 2 
diabetes with overt nephropathy. 
TAK-491 did not have any effect on plasma insulin obtained before glucose infusion and during steady 
state in spontaneous hypertensive rats. 
TAK-536 dose-dependently suppressed the increase in plasma glucose levels occurring during an Oral 
Glucose  Tolerance  Test  (OGTT)  in  obese  type  2  diabetes  mice,  suggesting  an  improvement  in  insulin 
sensitivity. TAK-536 also increased glucose uptake into tissues, especially skeletal muscles and adipose 
tissue.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
A  general  non-clinical  pharmacology  screen  (non-GLP)  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  potential  effect 
of 3-300 mg/kg TAK-536 on the cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, immune, reproductive, central 
and  autonomic  nervous  systems  in  various  animal  species  including  mice,  rats,  guinea  pigs,  rabbits, 
cats  and  dogs.  GPL-compliant  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  performed  to  examine  the  potential 
effects of TAK-491 and TAK-536 on cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems.  
Next to the expected decreasing effect on blood pressure, no significant TAK-491-related effects were 
seen  on  cardiovascular,  respiratory  or  central  nervous  systems  at  clinically  relevant  or  even  supra-
therapeutic dosages.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Angiotensin  II  receptor  blockers  and  anti-diabetic  PPARγ  agonists  are  often  used  together  in  patients 
suffering  from  hypertension  and  type-2  diabetes.  Hence,  the  effect  of  the  combination  TAK-536  and 
pioglitazone  on  diabetic  parameters  and  myocardial  infarct  size  in  diabetic  rats  was  evaluated.  Co-
administration  of  TAK-491  and  the  anti-diabetic  agonist  pioglitazone  tended  to  attenuate  left 
ventricular  remodelling  and  improved  left  ventricular  function  after  infarction  in  rats.  The  clinical 
significance of this finding is unknown.  
2.3.3  Pharmacokinetics 
Non-clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  conducted  in  mice,  rats,  rabbits,  dogs,  and  monkeys.  The 
formulation used in the non-clinical pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies was similar to those used 
in  the  toxicology  studies.  The  in  vitro  biotransformation  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  was  investigated  in 
mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans. The overall results of these investigations are reported below. 
Methods of analysis 
TLC  was  used  to  identify  and  quantify  azilsartan  medoxomil,  azilsartan,  M-I  and  M-II  in  urine  and 
faeces of the pre-clinical species (mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys). In urine and faeces samples 
from  humans,  LC-MS/MS  was  used  to  identify  and  quantify  the  pro-drug,  drug  and  its  2  major 
metabolites.  LC-MS/MS  was  used  to  determine  the  plasma  concentrations  of  the  salt  free  form  of 
azilsartan  medoxomil,  azilsartan,  M-I,  and  M-II  from  mice,  rats,  rabbits,  dogs  and  monkeys.  The 
analysis method used was sufficiently validated and was stable under the different investigated storage 
conditions.

Absorption 
Azilsartan  medoxomil  was  mostly  absorbed  from  the  jejunum,  duodenum,  and  ileum  and  was  poorly 
absorbed  from  the  stomach  and  colon.  Non-clinical  data  suggest  that  lymphatic  absorption  is  not 
important  for  this  compound.  Oral  absorption  and  bioavailability  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  were 
assessed  in  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys. After  oral  administration, conversion  from  azilsartan  medoxomil 
to  azilsartan  was  rapid  and  the  radioactivity  in  the  plasma  was  mainly  attributed  to  azilsartan. 
Systemic  exposure  to  azilsartan  medoxomil  was  negligible  after  oral  dose  administration  of 
[14C]azilsartan  medoxomil.  Cmax  was  reached  in  1  to  2.5  h  and  faster  under  fasted  conditions  as 
compared  to  fed  conditions.  The  half-life  of  azilsartan  in  plasma  was  between  4  and  6  h  in  rats  and 
dogs and ~12 h in humans. Systemic exposure to azilsartan medoxomil was negligible after oral dose 
administration  of  [14C]azilsartan  medoxomil,  except  in  juvenile  animals.  In  the  plasma,  the 
concentration of azilsartan was highest, followed by M-I and M II (<10% in plasma). In rats and dogs, 
the  increases  in  Cmax  and  AUC  for  azilsartan  were  dose  proportional  after  oral  azilsartan  medoxomil 
administration up to 200 mg/kg in rat and 300 mg/kg in dog. At higher dosages the increases in AUC 
and Cmax were less than dose proportional in rats. No higher dose than 300 mg/kg was investigated in 
dogs. Following repeated daily oral doses of azilsartan medoxomil, slight increases were noted in Cmax 
and AUC values and steady state was reached in 4 to 7 days.  
Distribution 
The  volume  of  distribution  of  azilsartan  was  similar  in  dogs  and  humans.  In  rats  and  monkeys,  the 
volume of distribution was around a factor 2 smaller. The clearance was larger in dogs than in rats and 
monkeys (a factor 10 to 4 smaller, respectively). In humans, the clearance was lower than in the pre-
clinical species. The slower clearance in humans was in agreement with the longer observed half-life in 
the  plasma.  Data  for  monkeys  were  provided  for  azilsartan.  However,  the  major  pre-clinical  species 
were rats and dogs. In addition, monkeys were not dosed with the pro-drug only but with the drug. In 
general, increases in exposure to M-I and M-II (as measured by Cmax and/or AUC values) were dose 
proportional  at  low  dosage  levels,  but  were  less  than  dose  proportional  at  higher  dosage  levels.  The 
bioavailability of azilsartan after oral administration of azilsartan medoxomil was 12% in rats, 54% in 
dogs  and  58%  in  humans.  In  contrast,  after  oral  administration  of  azilsartan  the  bioavailability  of 
azilsartan  was  41%  in  fasted  rats,  39%  in  fasted  dogs,  14%  in  monkeys  and  75%  in  humans.  The 
bioavailability  was  lower  under  fed  as  compared  to  fasted  conditions.  However,  in  clinical  studies  no 
influence of food on the bioavailability of azilsartan medoxomil was observed. The bioavailability of M-
II after oral administration was low and dosages of up to 2 g/kg/day were needed to reach adequate 
AUC levels for toxicological evaluation. 
Azilsartan  medoxomil  and  its  metabolites  are  highly  bound  to  plasma  proteins  and  the  major  binding 
protein  of  azilsartan  was  albumin  in  human  plasma.  The  distribution  of  azilsartan  into  blood  cells  of 
animals  and  in  humans  is  very  limited  (<5%).  Azilsartan  medoxomil  derived  material  does  not  have 
any  affinity  for  melanin.  Distribution  of  radioactivity  in  tissues  was  similar  in  animals  dosed  with 
[14C]azilsartan compared to animals dosed with [14C]azilsartan medoxomil.  
After a single oral dose of [14C]azilsartan medoxomil, only the liver had a ratio compared to plasma of 
>1 and radioactivity was eliminated rapidly in all tissues (including the liver) and in the plasma. After 
repeated dosing with azilsartan medoxomil for 14 days in rats, steady state tissue levels were achieved 
in 4 to 7 days. However, in the kidney concentrations of radioactivity increased across the 14 days of 
treatment  indicating  that  after  daily  oral  dosing  in  humans  accumulation  in  the  kidney  could  occur. 
However,  toxicology  results  did  not  show  liver  or  kidney  toxicity,  indicating  that  accumulation  was 
limited.  Azilsartan  medoxomil  related  radioactivity  gradually  transferred  into  the  foetuses  and  the 
major  radioactive  component  in  maternal  and  foetal  plasma  was  azilsartan.  Metabolite  M-I  was 
transferred over the placenta to the foetus with a ratio of 17 and metabolite M-II with a ratio of ~1.

Metabolism 
Azilsartan  medoxomil  is  rapidly  hydrolysed  to  the  active  moiety  azilsartan  by  esterases  in  the 
gastrointestinal  tract  and/or  during  drug  absorption.  Based  on  vitro  studies,  the  enzymes  involved  in 
the  hydrolysis  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  to  azilsartan  in  human  plasma,  and  in  human  liver  and  small 
intestinal  cytosol  seem  to  be  similar  to  those  involved  in  the  hydrolysis  of  olmesartan  medoxomil. 
Currently,  no  drug  interactions  are  listed  for  the  hydrolysis  of  azilsartan  medoxomil.  The  enzyme 
carboxymethylenebutenolidase is a recently discovered hydrolysis mechanism for azilsartan medoxomi 
in the intestine and liver, but no interactions with other drugs have been reported for this enzyme in 
the  DIDB  database.  Also  no  interactions  have  been  reported  for  human  serum  albumin  or 
arylesterases.  Since  there  are  multiple  esterase  pathways  involved  in  the  conversion  of  azilsartan 
medoxomil to azilsartan, the potential for interactions via this pathway is considered to be minimal. 
The  metabolites  M-I  and  M-II  were  formed  by  decarboxylation  and  dealkylation  of  azilsartan, 
respectively, and are pharmacologically inactive. CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 are all capable of metabolising azilsartan. However, CYP2C9 
showed the highest activity in metabolising azilsartan to M-II and CYP2C8 in metabolising azilsartan to 
M-I. 
Excretion 
In  animal  species,  the  faecal  excretion  route  is  dominating  (87-95%  of  the  dose)  and  only  a  small 
fraction  is  excreted  via  urine  (<10%  of  the  dose)  and  entero-hepatic  circulation  occurs  to  a  small 
degree. In humans, a major fraction of the radioactivity (42%) is excreted via urine. Metabolite M-II is 
mainly excreted via urine. Azilsartan related radioactivity was excreted in milk of lactating rats. Most of 
the radioactivity in rat milk consists of azilsartan (95% of the radioactivity in milk), but after 24 hours 
41% of the radioactivity are non-identified metabolites. In addition, metabolite M-II is transferred from 
plasma to milk with a ratio of >1 after 4 h (based on concentration in milk versus plasma). 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Azilsartan  medoxomil  is  not  a  substrate  for  P-glycoprotein  and  is  a  low  permeability  drug.  The 
involvement of P-glycoprotein in the transport of azilsartan was difficult to evaluate due to extremely 
low transport in Caco-2 cells, but based on the in vitro results it can be concluded that azilsartan is a 
low permeability drug. Azilsartan medoxomil is an inhibitor for P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux activity, 
while  azilsartan  is  not  an  inhibitor  for  P-glycoprotein.  Because  azilsartan  medoxomil  is  converted 
rapidly to azilsartan and because azilsartan is not a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, clinically significant drug-
drug  interactions  based  on  azilsartan  medoxomil  inhibitory  effect  on  P-glycoprotein  are  unlikely.  In 
addition, these conclusions are supported by clinical trials results.  
Azilsartan medoxomil inhibited CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4, but did not inhibit CYP2D6 and 
2E1. Azilsartan medoxomil showed the highest inhibition potential for CYP2C. Azilsartan decreased the 
activities  of  recombinant  CYP2C9  and  CYP2C8,  but  had  no  inhibitory  effect  on  other  CYP  isoforms. 
Intestinal  CYP2C  activity  is  limited  and  azilsartan  medoxomil  is  hydrolyzed  extensively  to  azilsartan 
during intestinal absorption. The mean Cmax of azilsartan in humans is 12 µmol/L after repeated oral 
dosing  with  80  mg  azilsartan  medoxomil  (highest  proposed  dose).  Therefore,  clinical  drug-drug 
interactions based on CYP inhibition by azilsartan medoxomil and azilsartan are unlikely. In addition, a 
clinical relevant drug-drug interaction between azilsartan medoxomil and pioglitazone or chlorthalidone 
is unlikely. 
A clinical DDI study of azilsartan with caffeine did not lead to a drug-drug interaction via CYP1A2. The 
results from the in vitro CYP1A2 and 2B6 induction studies indicated that neither azilsartan medoxomil 
nor azilsartan are inducers of CYP1A2 or CYP2B6.

2.3.4  Toxicology 
The  toxicity  of  TAK-491,  TAK-536  and  TAK-536  M-II  has  been  evaluated  in  an  extensive  non-clinical 
programme.  The  toxicology  programme  included  single-dose  and  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats 
and dogs, in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies, reproduction and developmental toxicity studies and 
carcinogenicity  studies.  Most  toxicity  findings  were  related  to  known  direct  and  indirect  effects  of 
inhibition of the RAAS by AT1 receptor blockade.  
Single dose toxicity 
The  acute  toxicity  of  the  prodrug  (TAK-491)  and/or  the  active  compound  (TAK-536)  has  been 
evaluated  in  single-dose  studies  in  mice  (oral  gavage)  and  rats  (oral  gavage  and  IV  bolus),  single 
escalating-dose  studies  in  beagle  dogs  (oral  gavage)  and  cynomolgus  monkeys  (oral  gavage).  For 
rodent studies (except toxicokinetic studies), clinical signs and body weight were recorded for up to 2 
weeks  post-dose,  and  necropsy  was  performed  at  the  end  of  the  observation  period.  In  non-rodent 
escalating-dose  studies,  clinical  signs,  body  weight,  and  food  consumption  were  recorded  for  up  to  2 
weeks post-dose but necropsy was not performed.  The effects in dogs included  short-term effects on 
food  consumption,  and  exaggerated  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  inhibition  of  the  RAAS,  including 
effects on the hematopoietic system (decreased erythroid parameters), renal function (increased BUN, 
creatinine),  and  electrolyte  disturbances  (increased  inorganic  phosphorus,  potassium,  gastrointestinal 
effects).  Similar  effects  were  also  observed  in  an  escalating-dose  oral  gavage  study  of  TAK-536  in 
monkeys. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  with  TAK-491  and/or  TAK-536  have  been  performed  by  oral 
administration  (gavage  or  dietary  admixture)  for  time  intervals  up  to  13  weeks  in  mice,  26  weeks  in 
rats, and 52 weeks in dogs.  
Mice 
CByB6F1  mice  and  the  repeat-dose  dietary  toxicity  of  TAK-536  was  evaluated  in  a  13-week  study  in 
B6C3F1 mice. Evaluation for TAK-491 and TAK-536-related effects included clinical observations, body 
weight,  food  consumption,  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  organ  weights,  gross  pathology,  and 
histopathology. The NOAEL for TAK-491 was in the 4-week study and < 20 mg/kg.day in the 13-week 
study for males and females. For TAK-536 in the 13-week study, 300 mg/kg/day was considered the 
maximum  tolerated  dietary  dose  based  on  the  changes  in  body  weight  gain.  The  target  organs  were 
the  kidneys  (juxtaglomerular  hypertrophy,  hyperplasia  of  the  afferent  glomerular  arterioles,  tubular 
damage,  papillary  mineralisation,  and  decreased  renal  function),  the  heart  (decreased  weight),  the 
hematopoietic system (decreased erythrocytes, haemoglobin concentration), the gastrointestinal tract 
(mucosal irritation, inflammation/erosions) and the adrenals (cortical hyperplasia). The effects on the 
kidney were associated with elevated circulating levels of BUN and the slight calcifications of the renal 
papilla.  The  effect  on  the  hematopoietic  system  seems  to  be  caused  by  the  suppression  of 
erythropoietin  production,  whereas  effects  on  the  heart  seem  to  reflect  the  decreased  heart  pre-  as 
well  as  after  load  mediated  by  the  hypotensive  action  of  TAK-536  by  lowering  peripheral  vascular 
resistance.  These  effects  on  the  heart  and  kidneys  were  consistent  with  the  induced  hypotension  by 
inhibition of the RAAS reducing renal perfusion. These pharmacologically-mediated undesirable effects 
are  known  from  non-clinical  studies  with  both  angiotensin  converting  enzyme  inhibitors  and 
angiotensin II receptor antagonists. In patients, TAK-491 is intended to restore normal blood pressure; 
under  these  circumstances,  the  hypotensive  states  necessary  for  reductions  in  renal  blood  pressure 
and consequent pathology would not arise.

Rats 
F344 rats were administered TAK-491 at oral gavage doses of 0, 2, 20, 200, or 2000 mg/kg/day for 4 
consecutive  weeks,  doses  of  0,  200,  600,  or  2000  mg/kg/day  for  13  consecutive  weeks.  F344  rats 
were  administered  TAK-491  at  oral  gavage  doses  of  0,  2,  20,  200,  or  2000  mg/kg/day  for  26 
consecutive  weeks.  F344  rats  were  administered  TAK-536  at  oral  gavage  doses  of  0,  3,  30,  300,  or 
3000  mg/kg/day  for  4  consecutive  weeks,  doses  of  0,  3,  30,  300,  or  3000  mg/kg/day  for  13 
consecutive  weeks  and  doses  of  0,  1,  10,  100,  or  1000  mg/kg/day  for  26  consecutive  weeks.  The 
target organs were the same as those in mice, and the observed effects were related to exaggerated 
pharmacodynamics  of  TAK-491  and/or  TAK-536.  The  histopathological  effects  on  the  kidney  were 
associated with elevated circulating levels of BUN and slightly increased urine production and/or water 
consumption. The persistence of the cell atrophy within the zona glomerulosa of the adrenals was not 
unexpected  given  the  known  direct  effects  of  AT1  receptor  blockade  on  aldosterone  synthesis  and 
release.  Changes  in  serum  enzymes  were  observed,  but  there  were  no  changes  in  weight  or 
histopathology of the liver in the tested dose range. The CHMP considered these changes not relevant 
for human. 
Dogs 
The  repeat-dose  oral  toxicity  of  TAK-491  was  evaluated  in  pivotal  4-  and  26-week  studies  in  beagle 
dogs.  Prior  to  these  studies,  a  2-week  preliminary  study  has  been  performed.  The  repeat-dose  oral 
toxicity  of  TAK-536  was  evaluated  in  4-,  13-,  26-  and  52-week  studies  in  beagle  dogs.  Beagle  dogs 
were administered TAK-491 at oral gavage doses of 0, 3, 12, 60, or 300 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive 
weeks. Beagle dogs were administered TAK-491 at oral gavage doses of 0, 3, 12, or 60 mg/kg/day for 
26  consecutive  weeks.  Beagle  dogs  were  administered  TAK-536  at  oral  gavage  doses  of  0,  30,  100, 
300, or 1000 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive weeks, at doses of 0, 10, 30, 100, or 500 mg/kg/day for 13 
consecutive  weeks.  A  52-week  repeat-dose  oral  toxicity  study  with  TAK-536  in  dogs  was  bridged  to 
TAK-491 development and substituted for a 39-week study of TAK-491 in dogs. A 52-week study with 
a  26-week  interim  sacrifice  was  performed  to  assess  the  chronic  toxicity  of  TAK-536  in  dogs.  Beagle 
dogs were administered TAK-536 at oral gavage doses of 0, 10, 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg/day for 26 or 
52 consecutive weeks.  
The  target  organs  were  the  same  as  those  in  mice  and  rats,  but  dogs  were  more  sensitive.  The 
observed  effects  were  related  to  exaggerated  pharmacodynamics  of  TAK-491  and/or  TAK-536. 
Changes in serum enzymes were observed, but there were no changes in weight or histopathology of 
the  liver  in  the  tested  dose  range.  These  changes  are  not  relevant  for  human.  The  provided  NOAEL 
values are based on findings in the kidney (basophilic tubules with dilatation) and stomach (erosions). 
Genotoxicity 
In vitro 
In the in vitro reverse mutation assays with TAK-491, azilsartan medoxomil salt free (TAK-491F) and 
the active moiety (TAK-536), the salt-free substance, showed a weak positive response in the in E.Coli 
strain WP2uvrA in the presence of S9 activation. The positive response with TAK-491F in this assay is 
likely to be due to the medoxomil side chain on the molecule. Hydrolysis of the medoxomil side chain 
includes  diacetyl,  which  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  associated  with  genotoxicity  in  vitro.  These 
findings  were  considered  not  to  be  relevant  to  human  safety.  The  diacetyl  compound  is  classified  as 
generally-recognized-as-safe  (GRAS)  by  the  US  FDA  and  is  found  in  various  foods  and  beverages. 
Additionally, exposure to diacetyl would be expected to be very limited since it would be metabolized 
rapidly  in  vivo  to  the  non-genotoxic  compounds  acetoin  or  2,3-butanediol.  In  the  chromosomal 
aberration tests in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells TAK-491 showed positive results in the absence of

S9  activation  and  TAK-536  showed  positive  results  both  in  the  presence  and  the  absence  of  S9 
activation.  The  induced  structural  chromosomal  aberrations  were  seen  at  concentrations  that  were 
associated with cytotoxicity. Additionally, threshold effects in genotoxicity assays have been recognized 
for certain classes of drugs, including angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). In the forward mutation 
assay at the HGPRT locus in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and the mutagenicity assay in L5178Y 
TK+/- mouse lymphoma cells TAK-536 showed negative results.  
In vivo 
Unscheduled  DNA  Synthesis  (UDS)  assays  in  rat  hepatocytes  with  TAK-491  and  TAK-536  showed 
negative  results.  The  micronucleus  and  chromosomal  aberrations  assays  in  the  bone  marrow  of  mice 
and rats with TAK-491 and TAK-536 were negative. To conclude TAK-536, TAK-491 and TAK-491F did 
not show a genotoxic risk. 
Carcinogenicity 
Long-term studies 
Two-year carcinogenicity studies were performed with TAK-491 in rats and with TAK-536 in mice and 
rats.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  increases  in  tumour  incidence  associated  with  any 
treatment in either species. 
Short or medium-term studies 
A  26-week  carcinogenicity  study  was  performed  with  TAK-491  in  transgenic  mice.  There  were  no 
statistically significant increases in tumour incidence associated with any treatment. 
To conclude carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats showed no concerns. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
In  rats  TAK-491  and  TAK-536  showed  no  effects  on  male  and  female  fertility.  The  F1  litters  showed 
dilated renal pelvis. This is a pharmacodynamic effect of TAK-536 following placental transfer.  
Embryo-foetal development 
The  Segment  II  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits  showed  adverse  effects  of  TAK-491/TAK-536  on  foetal 
development and growth at maternally toxic doses. These effects consisted of post-implantation loss, 
resorptions  and  skeletal  abnormalities  and  reduced  viability  of  the  foetus.  These  effects  are 
presumably due to reduced food consumption and body weights of the dams and decreased perfusion 
of  the  placenta  secondary  to  induced  hypotension.  As  pharmacological  effect,  dilation  of  the  renal 
pelvis was occasionally observed. There were no teratogenic effects in either species. In addition, TAK-
491 is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy and contraindicated during the second 
and third trimester of pregnancy in the SmPC as it is based on observations in humans in compounds 
of the same pharmacological class. This advice is agreed in view of the above findings. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
In  the  Segment  III  studies  in  rats,  there  was  dystocia  and  a  slight  delay  in  physical  development 
(delayed  incisor  eruption,  pinna  detachment,  eye  opening),  probably  a  consequence  of  reduced  body 
weight gain in the pups, secondary to maternal toxicity. TAK-536 is excreted into milk of lactating rats. 
Newborn  and  neonatal  rats  were  sensitive  to  in  utero  or  milk  exposure  to  TAK-536,  resulting  in 
reduced  viability,  dilation of  the  renal  pelvis  and/or  ureter,  hydronephrosis,  polycystic  kidneys,  and  a

rough  kidney  surface  (most  likely  a  reflection  of  renal  calcification).  The  effects  on  the  kidney  are 
considered  to  be  related  to  the  pharmacodynamics  of  TAK  536,  leading  to  altered  excretion  of 
electrolytes  and  to  an  increased  water  permeability  of  the  renal  tubules  as  the  result  of  decreased 
vasopressin release from the hypothalamus/neurohypophysis. 
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) were dosed and/or further evaluated  
With the intention to start a paediatric clinical trial, studies were conducted in juvenile rats with a TAK-
491/TAK-536-M-II combination. The studied time intervals enabled evaluation of the target organs of 
toxicity in 1-year-old children up to adolescence. The pilot studies in 0- and 7-day old rats showed that 
TAK-491  led  to  increased  mortality,  lower  body  weights  and  reductions  in  food  consumption,  and  a 
dilatation of the renal tubules, which is considered to be a pharmacodynamic effect. The heart weights 
were  reduced,  but  there  were  no  effects  on  heart  development.  The  5-week  and  13-week  pivotal 
studies in 7-day-old rats confirmed these findings.  
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance studies were conducted to evaluate the haemolytic potential and plasma compatibility 
of  a  parenteral  formulation  of  TAK-536  in  human  blood  and  to  evaluate  the  intravenous  and 
paravenous tolerance of this formulation in rabbits. 
In  vitro,  haemolytic  activity  and  plasma  compatibility  were  assessed  by  incubating  a  0.5  mg/mL 
solution of TAK-536 in human blood at a 1:10 ratio or in human plasma at a 1:100 ratio. Incubation of 
TAK-536 with human blood did not cause haemolysis, and incubation of TAK-536 with human plasma 
did not cause any macroscopic flocculation, precipitation, or coagulation.  
Paravenous tolerance of TAK-536 at 0.5 mg/mL was evaluated in male rabbits. The appropriate dosing 
solution was injected subcutaneously into the vicinity of the posterior auricular vein at a dose volume 
of  0.3  mL/site.  The  results  showed  slight,  but  reversible  changes  at  the  injection  site.  At  day  1  after 
injection,  slight  erythema  and  slight  or  mild  swelling  was  noted.  These  changes  lessened  gradually 
thereafter,  and  had  disappeared  by  10  and  7  days,  respectively.  No  vascular  dilatation  or  thrombus 
formation  was  noted.  Slight  haemorrhage  was  noted  in  a  few  animals  at  necropsy  2  days  after 
injection,  but  no  abnormalities  were  noted  in  any  TAK-536-treated  rabbits  at  necropsy  14  days  after 
injection.  In  the  histopathological  examination  2  days  after  injection,  the  subcutis  was  found  to  have 
slight  cellular  infiltration  in  all  3  TAK-536-treated  rabbits,  slight  oedema  in  2  of  3  TAK-536-treated 
rabbits, and mild haemorrhage in 1 of 3 TAK-536-treated rabbits. In the histopathological examination 
14 days after injection, no abnormalities were noted at any injection site. Based on these findings, the 
TAK-536 solution at 0.5 mg/mL is tolerable for IV clinical use. 
The  IV  tolerance  of  TAK-536  at  0.5  mg/mL  was  evaluated  in  male  rabbits.  The  appropriate  dosing 
solution was injected into the posterior auricular vein using an infusion pump set to a dose volume of 3 
mL  per  site  and  a  rate  of  1  mL/minute  for  3  minutes.  The  injection  sites  were  observed  for  signs  of 
local  irritation.  No  macroscopic  changes  were  observed  at  the  injection  sites.  Slight  endothelial 
desquamation  was  observed  in  all  3  TAK-536  rabbits  at  2  days  after  injection  but  slight  endothelial 
proliferation  was  only  observed  in  1  of  3  TAK-536  rabbits  14  days  after  injection.  Therefore,  this 
endothelial  desquamation  is  considered  reversible  in  TAK-536-treated  rabbits.  A  TAK-536  solution  at 
0.5 mg/mL was tolerable for IV clinical use.

Other toxicity studies 
Metabolites 
TAK-536  M-II  is  a  major  metabolite  of  TAK-491  in  humans,  but  is  a  relatively  minor  one  in  in  mice, 
rats,  rabbits,  and  dogs,  species  used  to  conduct  the  safety  assessment  of  TAK-491  and  TAK-536. 
Therefore, a toxicology programme was conducted with direct dosing of TAK-536 M-II. 
Initial toxicokinetic studies with TAK-536 M-II indicated superior absorption with SC dosing compared 
with  oral  gavage  dosing.  However,  the  metabolite  produced  local  irritation  with  repeated  SC  dosing 
and,  as  a  consequence  this  route  of  administration  was  deemed  unsuitable  for  studies  longer  than  4 
weeks  in  duration.  Therefore,  TAK-536  M-II  was  dosed  by  oral  gavage  in  the  13-week  rat  and  dog 
studies and in the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study. TAK-536 M-II was dosed as a dietary admixture in 
6-month mouse carcinogenicity studies. The results of these studies indicate some weak pharmacologic 
activity of TAK-536 M-II on AT1 receptors. No toxicologically  significant findings were seen in the 13-
week repeat-dose oral toxicity studies with TAK-536 M-II. Average exposure margins at the end of 13-
week studies were approximately  6.1-fold higher in rats and 6.9-fold higher in dogs (sexes combined) 
relative to humans given 80 mg TAK-491. Considering 99% in vivo protein binding for TAK-536 M-II in 
humans,  any  additional  contributions  of  this  metabolite  to  activity  at  AT1  receptors  would  be 
insignificant. 
There  were  no  adverse  effects  of  TAK-536  M-II  on  reproductive  or  developmental  parameters  at  oral 
doses up to 3000 mg/kg/day in rats or rabbits. 
No  new  toxicities  were  seen  in  the  TAK-536-MII  toxicity  programme.  Therefore  the  CHMP  considered 
that TAK-536 M-II is not a concern for human. 
Impurities 
Although  the  level  of  2-EH  in  the  rat  and  mouse  studies  was  below  the  specification  limit  of  1%,  the 
limit is considered qualified by means of the toxicological data from the provided reference, from which 
a large safety margin (366 mg/m2/day versus 0.49 mg/m2/day) can be deduced. 
For  the  positive  genotoxicity  findings  on  impurity  TAK-491  U-3,  the  applicant  provided  the  same 
discussion  as  for  results  on  TAK-491  and  TAK-491F.  The  formation  of  diacetyl  from  the  medoxomil 
group does indeed seem a plausible explanation for the positive results. Although there are no in vivo 
chromosomal  aberration  data  and  no  carcinogenicity  data  for  TAK-491  U-3  to  substantiate  the 
hypothesis,  unlike  for  the  parent  compound,  the  mechanism  underlying  the  effect  appears  to  be  the 
same, and no further studies are considered necessary. In vitro genotoxic effects of TAK-491 U-3 are 
not  relevant  for  humans.  With  regard  to  general  toxicity,  a  4-week  study  was  conducted  in  dogs,  in 
which no additional toxicity was found for TAK-491 U-3 when administered at 0.542 mg/kg/day. This is 
17-fold above the maximum human intake at 1% in the drug product, taking a conversion factor of 2 
in account for dogs versus human. It can be concluded that TAK-491 U-3 is qualified at a level of 1%. 
2.3.5  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  for  azilsartan  medoxomil  was  provided  in  accordance  with 
the CHMP guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00. TAK-491 is administered as a pro-drug by oral route. 
Under  in  vivo  conditions  the  pro-drug  is  rapidly  and  quantitatively  converted  to  the  active 
pharmaceutical  ingredient  TAK-536  by  hydrolysis.  A  Phase  I  environmental  risk  assessment  was 
performed  to  evaluate  potential  environmental  risks  of  TAK-491.  Referenced  studies  were  performed 
with the active pharmaceutical ingredient TAK-536. Based on the log Kow values (from the studies by 
Oudhoff and by Nishi), TAK-536 is not expected to be a bio-accumulative substance. The PECsurfacewater 
Edarbi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 21/88
 
 
 
 
 
of 0.32 μg/L exceeded the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. Thus a phase II - Tier A assessment was triggered. 
Based on the PEC/PNEC ratios calculated above, TAK-536 is not expected to pose unacceptable effects 
for the surface water, ground water and STP compartment. Since the log Koc is < 10000 L/kg, there is 
no  need  to  assess  the  risks  of  TAK-536  for  the  soil  compartment.  Based  on  the  results  of  the 
water/sediment  study  (OECD  study  308),  a  phase  II  -  Tier  B  assessment  was  triggered  for  the 
metabolites  TAK-536  M-I  and  TAK-536  M-III.  PECsediment  for  TAK-536-M-I  was  calculated  using 
Equilibrium  partitioning  and  REACH  (EUSES)  equations  using  characteristics  for  suspended  matter 
(sediment) and soil. EUSES standard suspended matter contains 10% organic carbon and soil contains 
2% organic carbon. A Koc of 12900 L/kg was used. However, no sediment toxicity study for the parent 
or main metabolite was performed. According to CHMP guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, effects on 
sediment organisms should be investigated.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point to be addressed: 
 
An  OECD  219  “Sediment-Water  Chironomid  Toxicity  Using  Spiked  water”  study  should  be 
conducted  to  complete  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment.  Once  the  results  are  available,  the 
Environmental Risk Assessment should be updated accordingly.  
The  results  from  this  additional  study  were  not  considered  required  by  the  Committee  before  the 
adoption of the positive CHMP opinion and it is confirmed that these applications comply with Article 6 
of Regulation 726/2004 having regard to the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83.

2.3.6  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Studies performed by the applicant clearly demonstrate that TAK-491 and TAK-536 significantly reduce 
blood pressure in various hypertensive models by potently, selectively and competitively blocking the 
angiotensin  II  type  1  receptor.  The  results  of  the  pharmacodynamic  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies 
performed clearly demonstrated the antihypertensive effects of TAK-491 and TAK-536. In comparison 
with  clinically  used  angiotensin  II  blockers,  the  antihypertensive  effects  of  TAK-491  and  TAK-536  are 
consistently more potent and longer lasting. In addition to their anti-hypertensive effect, the applicant 
demonstrated  that  TAK-491  and  TAK-536  may  have  potential  anti-diabetic  effects,  suggesting  that 
TAK-491  might  have  beneficial  effects  in  patients  suffering  from  metabolic  syndrome.  Next  to  these 
effects, no potential off-target activity would be expected in human patients orally treated with clinical 
doses up to 80 mg.  
Azilsartan  medoxomil  was  mostly  absorbed  from  the  jejunum,  duodenum  and  ileum.  After  oral 
administration  conversion  from  azilsartan  medoxomil  to  azilsartan  was  rapid.  Cmax  was  reached  in  1 
to 2.5 h. The half life in plasma (rats and dogs) was between 4 and 6h. Following repeated daily oral 
doses  steady  state  was  reached  in  4  to  7  days.  In  animals,  the  faecal  excretion  route  is  dominant.  
There is currently insufficient knowledge about possible interactions of azilsartan medoxomil with other 
drugs. At present, drug-drug interactions seem unlikely. 
In  the  toxicology  studies,  the  kidneys  heart,  hematopoietic  system  and  adrenals  were  the  primary 
target organs of TAK-536; the stomach was an additional target particularly in rats. TAK-491 and M-II 
crossed the placenta and were found in the foetuses of pregnant rats and were excreted into the milk 
of  lactating  rats.  No  effect  on  male  and  female  fertility  was  reported  in  the  reproduction  toxicity 
studies. TAK-491, TAK-536 and M-II did now show a genotoxic risk in vivo and a carcinogenotoxic risk 
in  rats  and  mice.  TAK-536  has  no  haemolytic  potential.  The  changes  observed  after  subcutaneous  or 
intravenous administration were all reversible. As the current application concerns a tablet formulation, 
the results of the local tolerance studies are of no further concern.  
An  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  for  azilsartan  medoxomil  was  provided  in  accordance  with 
the CHMP guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 including a phase I, phase II- Tier A and phase II-Tier 
B assessment.

2.3.7  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  overall  non-clinical  development  programme  was  considered  adequate  to  support  the  marketing 
authorisation application for azilsartan medoxomil and the concerns identified by the CHMP during its 
evaluation are considered resolved. 
2.4  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1  Introduction 
This  Marketing  Authorisation  application  is  a full, stand  alone application in  accordance  with  Directive 
2001/83/EC Article 8 (3). The Applicant is seeking a Marketing Authorisation for TAK-491 tablets (20, 
40, and 80 mg) for the once-daily treatment of essential hypertension in adults, either as monotherapy 
or taken concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents. The recommended starting dose is 40 mg 
taken once daily and this dose may be increased to a maximum of 80 mg once daily for patients whose 
blood  pressure  is  not  adequately  controlled  at  the  lower  dose.  A  20  mg  dose  once  daily  can  be 
considered  as  a  starting  dose  for  patients  at  risk  of  hypotension.  Five  phase  II  and  eleven  phase  III 
studies  (including  an  open-label  extension  of  one  of  the  double-blind,  controlled,  randomized,  versus 
placebo  monotherapy  study)  were  conducted  in  patients  with  essential  hypertension  to  establish  the 
therapeutic  dose  and  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  azilsartan  medoxomil.  A  Paediatric 
Investigation  Plan  (P/106/2010)  and  a  waiver  for  children  aged  below  6  months  of  age  have  been 
agreed for azilsartan medoxomil with the PDCO. A deferral to complete the PIP has been granted until 
April 2021. During the evaluation, a modification of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (P/39/2011) and 
of the waiver now for children below 1 year of age was agreed for azilsartan medoxomil with the PDCO. 
Scientific advice on the clinical development programme was not thought from the CHMP. 
GCP 
The  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  applicant.  The  applicant 
has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. The table below lists only 
the  main  phase  II  dose-finding  and  the  main  phase  III  studies  submitted  as  part  of  this  Marketing 
Authorisation Application.

2.4.2  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology programme for TAK-491 consisted of 17 phase 1 studies in which TAK-491 
was administered, and 18 phase 1 studies and 2 phase 2 studies in which TAK-536 was administered.  
The  formulation  development  of  TAK-491  progressed  from  a  capsule  to  a  tablet.  Consequently,  the 
capsule formulation was used in early phase 1 studies, and the proposed commercial tablet formulation 
was used in later phase 1 studies and also in all phase 3 studies. 
Azilsartan medoxomil (TAK-491) is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed rapidly to the active moiety, azilsartan 
(TAK-536), in the gastrointestinal tract and/or during absorption.  
Several  analytical  methods  were  used  to  determine  azilsartan  medoxomil,  azilsartan  and  its 
metabolites  in  the  different  studies  and  were  considered  adequate.  The  PK  parameters  analysed  and 
the statistical methods used were too considered acceptable. 
Absorption  
The  prodrug  TAK-491  was  undetectable  in  plasma  at  the  earliest  time  points  measured  (5  minutes 
following  administration).  TAK-536  was  detected  early  in  plasma,  with  a  median  tmax of  3  hours  after 
single-  and  multiple-dose  administration.  Following  multiple-dose  administration  of  TAK-491  80  mg 
(the highest proposed dose) the mean Cmax and AUC0-tau of TAK-536 were 5.7 µg/mL and 34 µg·hr/mL, 
respectively,  and  mean  Cmax  and  mean  AUC0-tau  of  TAK-536  M-II  were  1.8  µg/mL  and  25  µg·hr/mL, 
respectively.  
The permeability of TAK-491 and TAK-536 across Caco-2 cells was examined in vitro. In the tests TAK-
491  am  TAK-356  both  had  a  low  permeability;  however,  the  permeability  for  TAK-461  may  be 
underestimated due to rapid conversion to TAK-536.  
The  absolute  bioavailability  of  TAK-536  derived  from  the  TAK-491  tablet  is  estimated  to  be  60%, 
bridging  data  from  an  absolute  bioavailability  study  (study  536-016)  and  study  491-CHP-017.  Study 
491-CHP-017  is  a  relative  bioavailability  study  in  which  the  TAK-536  tablet  was  compared  with  the 
TAK-491 tablet and study 536-016 investigated the absolute bioavailability of the TAK-536 tablet.

Three  relative  bioavailability  studies  491-015,  491-001,  and  491-CHP-017  were  conducted  involving 
the TAK -536 tablets and TAK -491 tablets and capsules. The pharmacokinetic profile of TAK-536 was 
different between the TAK -536 tablets and the TAK-491 tablets and capsules.  
The AUC and the Cmax after administration of the TAK-491 tablets compared to the TAK-491 capsules 
was 68% and 77% higher, respectively. The AUC and Cmax after administration of the TAK-536 tablets 
compared  to  the  TAK-491  capsules  were  approximately  100%  and  200%  times  higher,  respectively 
(study  491-001).  The  AUC  and  Cmax  after  administration  of  TAK-491  tablets  compared  to  TAK-536 
tablets decreased to 62% and 46%, respectively.

The  applicant  selected  TAK-491  for  development  rather  than  TAK-536  as  TAK-491  has  a  better 
pharmacokinetic profile, with a lower Cmax and a tmax which is found after approximately 3 hours.  
The influence of food was evaluated in 4 studies. No food effect was observed following administration 
of  the  TAK-491  tablet  in  study  491-015.  The  TAK-491  tablet  can  therefore  be  administered  with  or 
without  food.  After  administration  of  the  TAK-491  capsule,  however  a  food  effect  was  observed 
(studies 491-001, 491-CPH-001 and 491-CPH-005).  
Several  studies  were  conducted  with  the  TAK-491  capsule.  These  studies  can  be  extrapolated  to  the 
TAK-491  tablet.  The  results  of  study  491-003  which  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  age, 
gender, and race on the PK of single and multiple doses of TAK-491 were confirmed by the population 
PK/PD  analysis.  The  design  of  studies  491-004  and  491-013  was  appropriate  to  ensure  that  study 
results would not be affected by the observed food effect.  
Distribution 
The  volume  of  distribution  of  TAK-536,  determined  after  an  IV  infusion  of  TAK-536,  is  approximately 
16L. In vitro and ex vivo, protein binding of TAK-536 is 90% and is similar in subjects with hepatic or 
renal impairment and in healthy matched controls. No selective uptake of TAK-536 into red blood cells 
occurs following administration of TAK-491. 
Non-clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the  reproduction  toxicity  of  azilsartan 
medoxomil,  from  these  studies  it  can  be  concluded  that  TAK-491  is  rapidly  hydrolyzed  to  TAK-536, 
which crosses the placenta and is found in the milk of lactating rats. 
Elimination 
After  oral  administration  of  TAK-491  approximately  42%  of  the  radioactivity  dosed  was  recovered  in 
the  urine  with  15%  of  the  dose  identified  as  TAK-536,  which  indicates  TAK-536  was  available 
systemically.  The  remaining  radioactivity  (55%)  that  appeared  in  faeces  after  oral  administration  of

TAK-491  could  be  attributed  either  to  biliary  excretion  of  TAK-536  and  its  metabolites  or  microbial 
metabolism of unabsorbed TAK-536 (converted from TAK-491) in the gastrointestinal tract. 
After administration TAK-491 is rapidly hydrolysed to TAK-536. In study 491-00047 in vitro hydrolysis 
of [14C]TAK-491 (10 µmol/l) in rats, dogs, and human hepatic and intestinal S9 fractions was assessed. 
TAK-491  was  hydrolyzed  rapidly  to  TAK-536  by  human  hepatic  and  intestinal  S9  fractions.  Less  than 
3%  of  TAK-491  remained  at  5 minutes  in  human  hepatic  S9  fractions,  and  approximately  20%  and 
<1%  of  TAK-491  remained  at  5 minutes  and  20  minutes,  respectively,  in  human  intestinal  S9 
fractions. At this moment it is not clear which enzymes are involved, but in vitro studies indicated that 
arylesterase and HAS may contribute to the hydrolysis of TAK-491 to TAK-536.  
The metabolism of TAK-536 after TAK-491 administration is extensive, and 2 metabolites are formed in 
humans: TAK-536 M-I, a minor decarboxylated metabolite which is formed primarily via cytochrome P-
450CYP2C8,  and  TAK-536  M-II,  a  major  O-dealkylated  metabolite,  which  is  formed  primarily  via  CYP 
2C9.  In  vitro  tests  showed  that  M-I  and  M-II  are  also  formed  via  multiple  minor  CYP  pathways. 
Exposures  (AUC)  to  these  2  metabolites  in  human  plasma,  relative  to  TAK-536  are  <1%  and 
approximately 50% respectively. The affinities of TAK-536 M-I andTAK-536 M-II for AT1 receptors are 
1770- and 850-fold less than that of TAK-536 respectively in vitro. Therefore, neither metabolite would 
be  expected  to  contribute  to  the  pharmacological  activity  at  exposures  associated  with  the  proposed 
commercial doses of TAK-491.  
Genetic polymorphism is not expected to have consequences with regard to the bioavailability of TAK-
536  as  there  are  multiple  pathways  of  metabolism  and  excretion.  This  is  supported  by  population  PK 
data which could not identify subgroups that would be indicative of polymorphism. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose  proportionality  of  exposure  to  TAK-536  and  TAK-536  M-II,  the  major  human  metabolite,  was 
established at doses from 20 to 320 mg using data from several single and multiple dose studies. No 
accumulation of TAK-536 and TAK-536 M-II was observed. 
Special populations 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
A  population  PK  data  study  (study  491CLD_302)  was  submitted.  In  this  study  hypertensive  patients 
received TAK-491 and chlorthalidone, either alone or in combination. The PK data of the combination 
tablets  with  TAK-491  and  chlorthalidone  were  used  in  this  population  PK  model.  Co-administration  of 
chlorthalidone with TAK-491 resulted in small clinically non significant increases in systemic exposure 
parameters (AUC and Cmax) in the DDI study 491-004. 
The  final  population  PK  model  for  TAK-536/M-II  is  a  simultaneous  parent-metabolite  model  with  first 
order absorption and elimination with the disposition of TAK-536 and M-II being described by 2 and 1 
compartments  respectively.  Age  and  body  weight  were  identified  as  significant  covariates.  The 
magnitude  of  the  effects  resulting  in  variability  of  exposure  to  TAK-536  of  ±20%  are  considered  not 
clinically relevant. 
Edarbi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 29/88
 
 
 
 
 
The  population  PK  model-based  simulating  exposure  estimates  for  TAK-536  in  subjects  with 
hypertension were compared with observed non-compartmental-derived estimates for healthy subjects 
receiving  similar  doses  of  TAK-491.  The  mean  simulated  AUC  values  in  subjects  with  hypertension 
were up to 27% higher across dose levels, compared with the observed values in healthy subjects. In 
contrast,  mean  simulated  steady  state  Cmax  was  approximately  34%  lower  across  dose  levels  in 
subjects  with  hypertension  when  compared  with  the  observed  values  in  healthy  subjects  following 
administration of TAK-491. The CHMP considered neither of these differences to be clinically relevant.  
Additionally  a  population  PK  study  (536-CCT-001)  was  conducted  with  the  TAK-536  tablet.  The  final 
population  PK  model  of  this  study  was  a  simplified  steady-state  model,  with  age,  aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and creatinine levels identified as factors influencing the CL/F of TAK-536. The 
value of the study is limited as only 1.94 samples/ patient were collected and there was no attempt to 
characterise the PK profile over a 24 hour period and at Cmax.  
The extrapolation of PK data from healthy volunteers to patients is properly justified.  
Variability 
The intra-individual variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters of TAK-536 derived from proposed 
commercial TAK-491 tablet was approximately 25% for AUC and 30% for Cmax in the different studies. 
Renal impairment 
Total exposure (AUC) to TAK-536 after a single dose of TAK-491 tended to be higher in subjects with 
renal  impairment  than  in  healthy  subjects,  with  increases  of  30%,  25%,  96%  in  subjects  with  mild, 
moderate,  and  severe  renal  impairment  (study  TAK491_103).  However,  only  a  5%  increase  was 
observed  in  patients  with  End  Stage  Renal  Disease  (ESRD).  Subjects  with  ESRD  are  dialysed  and 
cannot be compared to the other groups. In subjects with renal impairment a 2-5 fold increase of the 
TAK-536-M-II  exposure  was  observed.  This  observed  increase  of  TAK-536-M-II  is  not  clinically 
relevant.  Based  on  the  results  of  study  TAK491_103,  caution  is  needed  in  patients  with  severe  renal 
impairment and ESRD as reflected in the SmPC. 
The  PK  of  unbound  TAK-536  and  its  metabolites  (M-I  and  M-II)  were  similar  to  the  PK  of  total  drug 
concentrations in subjects with renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Clinical  experience  treating  patients  with  any  type  of  hepatic  impairment  is  extremely  limited.  One 
hepatic impairment study was conducted including 8 patients with mild and 8 patients with moderate 
hepatic  impairment  (study  491-102).  Steady-state  total  exposures  to  TAK-536  were  approximately 
28%  and  64%  greater  in  subjects  with  mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment,  respectively.  Steady-
state  total  exposures  to  TAK-536  M-II  were  27%  and  36%  greater  respectively.  Since  the  individual 
values for the Child-Pugh scores were not recorded in the CRF, it was not possible to assess properly 
whether the study population was appropriate. This deficiency does not call for a new study, however 
caution is needed and a starting dose of 20 mg could be considered in subjects with mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment. The PK of unbound TAK-536 and its metabolites (M-I and M-II) were similar to the 
PK of total drug concentrations in subjects with hepatic impairment. 
Azilsartan  medoxomil  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  and  therefore 
its use is not recommended in this patient group as reflected in the SmPC. 
Gender and race  
No  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  exposure  to  TAK-536  related  to  gender,  race  (white  versus 
black) were observed (study 491-003).  
Edarbi 
CHMP assessment report

In  the  population  PK  study  (study  491CLD_302)  age  was  identified  as  a  significant  covariate.  The 
magnitude  of  the  effects  resulting  in  variability  of  exposure  to  TAK-536  of  ±20%  is  considered  not 
clinically relevant.  
There  are  insufficient  data  to  provide  a  specific  analysis  for  the  comparison  between  the  White  and 
Asian population after administration of the TAK-491 tablet. Instead data from study 536-EC101 were 
compared  with  data  from  study  536-CPH-00.  In  both  studies  TAK-536  tablets  were  administered.  No 
differences between the White and Asian subjects observed. The use of the studies with the TAK-536 
tablet is properly justified. 
Weight  
In  the  population  PK  study  (study  491CLD_302)  weight  was  identified  as  a  significant  covariate.  The 
magnitude  of  the  effects  resulting  in  variability  of  exposure  to  TAK-536  of  ±  20%  is  considered  not 
clinically relevant. 
Elderly population 
The  mean  age  of  the  elderly  subjects  was  68.7  ±  4.77  years.  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  in 
exposure  to  TAK-536  related  to  age  (<45  years  of  age  vs  ≥  65  years  of  age)  were  observed.  In  the 
SmPC is mentioned that a starting dose of 20 mg can be considered in the very elderly (≥  75 years). 
Although sparse pharmacokinetic data are available for this age group this advice is acceptable based 
on clinical experience. 
Paediatric population 
The use of TAK-491 was not evaluated in children. The absence of data in children is acceptable as the 
application concerns use in the adult population only.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro studies  
The  potential  of  TAK-491  and  TAK-536  to  induce  CYP3A  is  low.  The  potential  of  TAK-491  to  inhibit 
cytochrome  P450  was  investigated  for  the  most  relevant  CYP  enzymes  (CYP1A2,  CYP3A4,  CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1) and TAK-536 has been evaluated (CYP2C8, CYP2C9) 
in vitro using human liver microsomes and B-lymphoblastoid-derived microsomes. From these in vitro 
studies it can be concluded that CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 might be relevant for drug-drug interactions.  
The permeability and involvement of Pgp has been investigated sufficiently. The permeability of TAK-
491 and TAK-536 is low and TAK-491 had an inhibitory effect on Pgp-mediated efflux activity in vitro.  
In vivo studies with TAK-491 
Following  co-administration  of  TAK491  with  an  aluminium-magnesium  hydroxide  antacid  (study  TAK-
491_107)  a  decreased  exposure  to  TAK-536  of  18%  was  observed.  This  decrease  is  not  clinically 
meaningful.  In  population  PK  data  study  491CLD-302  the  co-administration  of  TAK491  with  Proton 
Pump  Inhibitors  (PPIs)  was  evaluated.  The  study  shows  that  the  median  exposure  to  TAK-536  in 
subjects who received concomitant PPIs is comparable with the median exposure in subjects who did 
not receive concomitant PPIs. 
Concomitant  administration  of  TAK-491  with  either  chlorthalidone,  amlodipine  or  digoxine  had  no 
clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of TAK-491 or the respective medicinal product.  
The  interaction  between  TAK  491  and  multiple  cytochrome  P450CYP  probes  was  investigated.  A 
cocktail  of  midazolam  (3A4),  caffeine  (1A2),  tolbutamide  (2C9),  dextromethorphan  (2D6),  and 
Edarbi 
CHMP assessment report

fexofenadine  (PgP-probe)  was  administered,  following  multiple  dose  administration  of  TAK  491.  Co-
administration of TAK491 and the drug combination did not have a clinically relevant effect on any of 
the  tested  cytochrome  P450  probes,  the  exposure  to  the  P-glycoprotein  (PgP)  probe  was  slightly 
decreased (by 16%). Probably this interaction is not clinically relevant, as no interaction with digoxin 
was observed in study TAK-491_104.  
Two additional in vitro studies were submitted during the evaluation which addressed TAK-536’s effect 
on pravastatin and atorvastatin uptake by OATP1B1. No inhibition of the uptake by TAK-536 was seen 
in these studies. Cyclosporine A was used as a positive control in a concentration of 1 µmol/L and 10 
µmol/L,  and  inhibited  the  uptake  of  both  substrates  significantly  (27%  and  19%  respectively).  Other 
sartans have been shown to be substrates for the OATP transporters, therefore a potential interaction 
with statins could be of clinical interest. No inhibition of pravastatin or atorvastatin uptake occurred in 
cryopreserved  human  hepatocytes.  Cyclosporine  A  is  a  non-specific  inhibitor  of  several  SLC 
transporters.  No  specific  blocking  of  other  transporters  was  used  in  this  study.  Statins  are  also 
substrates  of  OATP1B3.  Hence,  results  from  these  studies  can  be  extrapolated  to  other  transporters 
and  it  can  be  concluded  that  no  interaction  between  azilsartan  and  statins  is  expected  via  uptake 
transporters. 
Thus, in vitro study did not suggest that azilsartan inhibits an uptake of statins and no further in vivo 
study is needed. The CHMP considered that the interaction potential has been studied sufficiently. 
No  drug  interaction  studies  were  conducted  between  TAK-491  or  TAK-536  and  lithium,  non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs),  or  potassium-sparing  diuretics  because  clinical  evidence  already 
informs the potential risks associated with concomitant administration of these drugs and other drugs 
in the same class as TAK-491. Literature references were provided and this was considered acceptable. 
The  extrapolation  of  literature  data  on  the  interaction  of  other  ARBs  with  lithium,  non-steroidal  anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and potassium-sparing diuretics can be accepted.  
In vivo studies with TAK-536 
Additionally,  several  studies  were  conducted  with  TAK-536  the  active  metabolite.  Most  of  the  drug-
drug interaction studies conducted with TAK-536 can be extrapolated to TAK-491. 
In  study  536-006,  no  interaction  between  TAK-536  and  the  CYP2C8  substrate  pioglitazone  was 
observed.  Negligible  inhibition  of  CYP2C8  activity  was  observed  in  in  vitro  studies  with  TAK-536. 
However,  in  vitro  tests  suggest  that  TAK-491  has  a  potential  for  drug-drug  interactions  with  CYP2C8 
substrates. As TAK-491 appears to be hydrolysed pre-systematically to TAK-536 entirely and CYP2C8’s 
expression in the GI tract is very small, no first pass interaction is expected. No new drug interaction 
study with TAK-491 and pioglitazone is therefore required. 
In  study  TAK-536_004  the  same  drug  combination  as  in  study  TAK-491_013  was  administered.  Co-
administration of TAK-536 and the drug combination did not have a clinically relevant effect on any of 
the tested cytochrome P450 probes, but also the exposure to the P-glycoprotein (PgP) probe was also 
not affected. The results of this support the findings of study TAK-491_013. 
Co-administration  of  the  CYP2C9  inhibitor  fluconazole  and  TAK-536  (study  TL-536-005)  resulted  in  a 
42%  increase  in  TAK-536  AUC(0-inf),  a  14%  increase  in  TAK-536  Cmax,  and  a  48%  increase  in  XU(0-24)  
(total  estimated  amount  of  analyte  in  the  urine  collected  over  a  24  h  postdose  period  divided  by  the 
ytotal volume of urine collected) relative to administration of TAK-536 alone. Plasma clearance of TAK-
536  was  reduced  with  co-administration  (0.87  L/hr  versus  1.25  L/hr),  but  renal  clearance  was  not 
(0.17 L/hr versus 0.16 L/hr) affected, furthermore, T1/2 and Tmax were not affected.  
Co-administration  of  the  CYP  3A4  inhibitor  ketoconazole  and  TAK-536  (study  TL-536-005)  did  not 
result in an increase of exposure of TAK-536 as expected, but resulted in a decrease in TAK-536 AUC0-

inf  (by  21%),  Cmax (by  32%) and  urinary  excretion  (by  17%)  and  delayed  Tmax  values  (3.21  vs  2.06 
hr). Neither plasma clearance nor renal clearance nor T1/2 of TAK-536 was affected. This is possibly due 
to reduced absorption of TAK-536 by ketoconazole.  
Co-administration of TAK-536 and metformin (study TL-536-011) did not significantly alter the steady-
state concentrations of plasma TAK-536 and M-I or the respective medicinal product.  
In study 536-009 the drug-drug interaction of TAK-536 and warfarin was evaluated. Warfarin is used 
as  a  probe  for  CYP2C9  ((S)-warfarin)  and  CYP1A2  ((R)-warfarin)  Multiple  doses  of  TAK-536  did  not 
affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin.  
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  glyburide  (CYP2C9  probe)  was  not  affected  by  multiple-dose 
administration of TAK-536 (study TL-536-010).  
2.4.3  Pharmacodynamics 
The  following  studies  were  performed  to  assess  the  antagonistic  properties  of  azilsartan  on  the  AT1 
receptor influencing the RAAS system. 
Table 4.  Phase I PD studies 
Mechanism of action 
TAK-536,  the  active  metabolite  of  TAK-491,  is  an  AT1  receptor  blocker  that  influences  the  RAAS 
system.  Compensatory  hormonal  profile  is  consistent  with  blockade  of  AT1  receptors  which  means 
increase  of  plasma  renin  activity  and  angiotensin  I  (AI)  and  angiotensin  II  (AII)  concentrations  and 
reduction of aldosterone concentrations. The RAAS blockade is known to be associated with reduction 
in blood pressure with a relative shallow dose-response curve. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
The effects of the TAK-491 capsule in both fed and fasted conditions, and the effects of the TAK-536 
tablet on the pharmacodynamic markers (renin activity and concentrations of aldosterone, angiotensin 
I  and  II  in  the  plasma)  in  study  491-001  were  consistent  with  antagonism  of  the  AT1  receptor.  The 
single-dose  pharmacodynamics  of  TAK-491  capsules  under  fasted  and  fed  conditions  were  also 
examined in 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose studies in Japan in which 
subjects  received  single  doses  of  TAK-491  that  ranged  from  0.5  to  160  mg  and  in  3  double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled ascending-dose studies in which subjects received single doses of TAK-
536 that ranged from 0.3 to 80 mg. 
The  multiple-dose  pharmacodynamics  of  TAK-491  were  examined  in  subjects  who  received  TAK-491 
60,  80,  or  160  mg  capsules  in  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  sequential-panel, 
ascending-dose  study.  A  dose-response  was  observed  for  the  pharmacodynamic  markers  on  Day  10 
(compared with Day 1), which indicates a cumulative effect of multiple dosing with TAK-491. 
Edarbi 
CHMP assessment report

In  general,  the  blocking  of  the  AT1  receptor  by  azilsartan  demonstrates  the  hormonal  compensatory 
mechanism to be expected.  
Secondary pharmacology 
A  clear  inhibition  of  blood  pressure  increases  following  angiotensin  II  injection  (vasoconstrictor)  was 
demonstrated in study 536-GHBA-328 in which subjects received IV infusions of angiotensin II before 
oral doses of placebo or TAK-536 (0.3 to 20 mg). These doses correspond approximately to a TAK-491 
tablet dose of 0.5 to 32 mg. The data presented suggest that the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin 
II  is  dose-dependently  blocked  at  the  site  of  the  AT1  receptor.  But  higher  dosages  than  the  20  mg 
dose  and  comparison  with  other  ARBs  have  not  been  made.  During  the  evaluation,  some  additional 
data were provided indicating a sustained receptor antagonist binding of the TAK-536 in comparison to 
other AT1 antagonists. One argument put forward was that this tight receptor binding translated into 
long-lasting antihypertensive effects. A long-lasting antihypertensive effect would also be expected to 
translate  into  sustained  24  h  antihypertensive  effect,  in  addition  to  a  more  potent  BP  lowering 
compared to other AT1 antagonists. However, the 24 h antihypertensive effect was not better than for 
olmesartan (expressed as trough to peak ratio). Also pharmacokinetics properties of azilsartan are not 
very different from that of olmesartan (T1/2 of approximately 10 hours). Thus the more potent effect of 
azilsartan may primarily be explained by the sustained receptor binding. As also discussed in the non-
clinical part, results of indirect kinetic experiments clearly show that azilsartan slowly dissociates from 
the AT1 receptor and that this dissociation is significantly slower compared to the other ARBs tested. 
In addition the inverse agonism may contribute as well. 
No specific studies have been performed to evaluate pharmacodynamic interactions and for genetically 
differences in PD response. 
Thorough QT/TQc study 
In  study  491-007  the  effect  of  TAK-491  320  mg  on  the  QTc  interval  was  investigated.  This  thorough 
QT/QTc study was a 3 period crossover study. A single dose of TAK-491 320 mg was administered as 
test  therapy  and  placebo  and  moxifloxacin  400mg  were  administered  as  reference  therapy.  The 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  TAK-536  and 
its  metabolites  were 
characterized  and 
electrocardiograms  (ECGs)  were  used  for  QTc  assessment.  The  mean  differences  between  TAK-491 
320  mg  and  placebo  for  all  QTc  intervals  (QTcF,  QTcB,  and  QTcI)  did  not  exceed  10  ms  at  any  time 
point. TAK-491 320 mg did not prolong QTc intervals and was well-tolerated in healthy subjects. 
2.4.4  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology programme for TAK-491 consisted of a limited number of studies with TAK-
491  tablet.  Several  supportive  studies  were  conducted  with  TAK-536  formulations.  In  general  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  TAK-536  and  its  metabolites  after  administration  of  TAK-491  was  sufficiently 
characterised.  The  pharmacokinetics  in  subjects  with  renal  impairment  has  been  sufficiently 
investigated.  Caution  is  needed  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  ESRD.  In  subjects  with 
mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment  a  starting  dose  of  20  mg  could  be  considered.  The 
pharmacokinetics  of  TAK-491  tablets  has  not  been  evaluated  in  subjects  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment.  The  effects  of  age,  gender  and  weight  have  been  sufficiently  investigated.  The  effect  of 
race has been investigated. For the white versus the black population the data showed sufficiently that 
the differences in pharmacokinetics are not clinically relevant.  
A  dose  dependent  modulation  of  the  components  of  the  RAAS  was  demonstrated  with  an  increase  in 
renin,  angiotensin  I  and  angiotensin  II  and  a  decrease  in  aldosterone,  as  can  be  expected  from  an 
ARB.  In  multiple  dosing  these  effects  were  less  pronounced.  A  dose  dependent  inhibition  of  blood

pressure was demonstrated by blocking the vasoconstrictory effect of angiotensin II at the site of the 
AT1  receptor.  Higher  dosages  than  the  20  mg  dose  have  not  been  tested.  Although  this  proposed 
mechanism could translate into a stronger longer lasting antihypertensive effect, clinical data in terms 
of 24 hour antihypertensive effect (expressed as through to peak ratio) show similar efficacy between 
azilsartan and olmesartan.  
2.4.5  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  non-clinical  and  clinical  data  submitted  together  with  the  experience  with  TAK-491  and  TAK-536 
are considered adequate to support the marketing authorisation and use of azilsartan medoxomil. 
2.5  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1  Dose response studies 
Dose  selection  for  the  phase 3  clinical  programme  was  based  primarily  on  the  results  of  two  pivotal 
dose response trials. In addition, 3 supportive trials were conducted. The primary endpoint was clinical 
diastolic blood pressure.

Study  536-002  was  a  placebo  and  active-controlled  dose-ranging  study  conducted  with  TAK-536 
tablets 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg once daily (approximately corresponds to TAK-491 5 to 
80  mg).  The  active  comparator  was  olmesartan  medoxomil  20  mg  once  daily.  Eligible  subjects  were 
randomized to 8 weeks of daily treatment after the washout/run-in period. The primary endpoint was 
clinical  DBP.  A  total  of  574  subjects  were  randomized.  The  5  to  40  mg  doses  of  TAK-536  were  each 
associated  with  statistical  significant  reductions  in  both  endpoints  relative  to  placebo,  and  greater 
reductions were observed with increasing dose: PLB (-6.7, -5.9), TAK-539 2.5 mg (-9.5, -12.5), 5 mg 
(-10.2, -12.3), 10 mg (-12.0, -14.2), 20 mg (-12.4, -17.5), 40 mg (-14.4, -17.5) and olmesartan 20 
mg (-10.1, -12.4).  
Study  491-005  was  a  placebo  and  active-controlled  dose-ranging  study  conducted  with  a  capsule 
formulation of TAK-491 at doses of 5 to 80 mg. The active comparator was olmesartan medoxomil 20 
mg once daily. The primary endpoint was clinical DBP. Clinical SBP and ABPM parameters of DBP and 
SBP  were  secondary  endpoints.  A  total  of  449  subjects  were  randomized  (63  to  65  per  group). 
Reduction  in  DBP  and  SBP  (mmHg)  demonstrated  the  following  results:  PLB  (-7.9,  -4.9),  TAK-491  5 
mg (-10.8, -11.0), 10 mg (-13.1, -15.7), 20 mg (-11.5, -14.7), 40 mg (-13.6, -17.1), 80 mg (-11.6, -
13.3) and olmesartan 20 mg (-11.0, -13.5). It was later observed that the tablet formulation of TAK-
491  has  a  more  favourable  pharmacokinetic  profile  compared  with  the  capsule  (i.e.  the  tablet  has

greater  bioavailability  and  no  food  effect).  As  a  result,  the  TAK-491  tablet  was  administered  in 
subsequent phase 3 studies and is the formulation proposed for commercialisation.

General issues applying to all studies 
Methods 
Study participants  
For inclusion in the studies patients had to fulfil all of the following criteria: 
  All double-blind, randomized, controlled monotherapy studies included adult subjects 18 years 
of  age  or  older  with  uncomplicated,  mild  to  moderate  essential  hypertension.  Subjects  could 
have been naïve to treatment or previously treated with antihypertensive agents.  
  All subjects in the monotherapy placebo and active-controlled studies were required to have a 
baseline clinical SBP ≥ 150 and ≤ 180 mm Hg and a 24-hour mean SBP ≥130 and ≤170 mm 
Hg  (the  latter  criterion  was  not  required  in  study  491-020  as  clinical  SBP  was  the  primary 
endpoint of this study).  
 
In the controlled co-administration studies, subjects were required to have moderate-to-severe 
essential  hypertension,  as  defined  by  a  baseline  clinical  SBP  ≥  160  and  ≤  190  mm  Hg  and  a 
24-hour mean SBP ≥ 140 and ≤ 180 mm Hg, except FDC study 491CLD-306, where inclusion 
criteria  were  based  on  clinic  measures  only.  Subjects  with  baseline  DBP  >  119  mm  Hg  were 
excluded. 
  Subjects with baseline DBP > 114 mm Hg were excluded. 
 
In  the  co-administration  studies  and  active-controlled  monotherapy  studies  without  a  placebo 
control,  subjects  with  a  history  of  a  cardiovascular  event  may  have  been  enrolled  at  the 
investigator’s discretion if the event was distant (> 24 weeks), thereby allowing a reasonable 
number of higher risk subjects to be enrolled for evaluation across the TAK-491 monotherapy 
phase 3 programme.  
The most important criteria for exclusion from the studies were the following: 
  Subjects  with  a  history  of  a  major  cardiovascular  event  or  condition  (myocardial  infarction, 
unstable  angina,  heart 
failure,  coronary 
intervention,  hypertensive  encephalopathy, 
cardiovascular  accident,  or  transient  ischemic  attack)  were  excluded  from  all  placebo-
controlled studies to avoid extended exposure to placebo in these subjects. 
  Subjects  with  history  of  severe  renal  disease  (calculated  glomerular  filtration  rate  [GFR]  <30 
mL/min/1.73 m2) were excluded from all studies. 
  Subjects  with  known  or  suspected  unilateral  or  bilateral  renal  artery  stenosis  were  also 
excluded. 
  Subjects with hyperkalemia. 
  Subjects with hypokalemia, were excluded from the chlorthalidone coadministration study 491-
009 and FDC study 491CLD-306. 
 
In  controlled  studies,  subjects  receiving  other  medication  classes  known  to  have  blood 
pressure-altering  effects  were  excluded.  These  medications  included  other  antihypertensive 
agents,  including  those  prescribed  for  indications  other  than  hypertension  (secondary 
cardiovascular prevention, related coronary heart disease, benign prostatic hypertrophy, etc).  
  Subjects with controlled type 2  diabetes were allowed to enroll in all studies, although use of 
insulin or thiazolidinediones was prohibited. 
Edarbi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 37/88
 
 
 
 
 
  Due  to  their  potential  to  possibly  alter  blood  pressure,  other  prohibited  medications  included 
tricyclic  antidepressants,  monoamine  oxidase 
inhibitors,  atypical  antipsychotics,  diet 
medications,  amphetamines,  and  systemic  corticosteroids.  Chronic  use  of  common  cold 
medications  or  nonsteroidal  antiinflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDS)  (including  high-dose  aspirin 
[>325 mg/day] or cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors) was also prohibited.  
Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  considered  appropriate  although  these  inclusion  criteria  lead  to 
recruitment  of  a  rather  homogenous  population  of  primarily  mild-to-moderate  essential  hypertension 
with  little  comorbidity.  This  does  not  seem  however  to  be  too  different  to  other  recently  approved 
antihypertensives i.e. aliskiren.  
Treatments 
The  randomized,  double-blind,  controlled,  phase  3  studies  and  the  FDC  study  incorporated  a  3  to  4 
week  washout  period  for  subjects  who  were  previously  receiving  antihypertensive  therapy.  These 
subjects  discontinued  their  previous  treatments  at  screening  and  remained  untreated  during  the 
washout, thereby allowing for establishment of a treatment-free baseline blood pressure. All subjects, 
including subjects who were naïve to treatment, also participated in a 2-week single-blind placebo run-
in  period.  For  subjects  who  were  receiving  previous  antihypertensive  treatments,  the  run-in  period 
coincided with the last 2 weeks of the washout. The purpose of the placebo run-in period was to reduce 
the influence of placebo effect on the baseline blood pressure measurement. Baseline blood pressures 
were recorded after completion of the washout/run-in period and before initiation of double-blind study 
drug.  Incorporation  of  the  placebo  run-in  period  also  allowed  for  evaluation  of  each  subject’s 
compliance  with  the  dosing  regimen.  Subjects  who  were  noncompliant  with  single-blind  placebo 
(<70% or >130%) were not randomized. 
Specific study design are described for each study separately or pooled studies of similar design  
The  washout  period  used  is  considered  sufficiently  long  to  exclude  a  carry-over  effect.  In  addition, 
suitable measures are taken to exclude patients who may be already initially non compliant. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was: 
  24-hour mean SBP was chosen as the primary endpoint in the majority of studies, except for 
studies 491-020 and 491CLD-306.  
According to the applicant this was done due to azilsartan medoxomil’s improved sensitivity relative to 
clinic  blood  pressure  in  terms  of  predicting  cardiovascular  outcomes  in  observational  trials  and  in 
accordance with the CHMP Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of 
hypertension. 
The  following  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  analysed  in  the  order  presented  using  a  hierarchical 
procedure: 
  Clinical  SBP  was  identified  as  the  key  secondary  endpoint  in  the  TAK-491  monotherapy 
programme in recognition of its importance and widespread use in the traditional evaluation of 
antihypertensive therapies.  
  24-hour mean DBP by ABPM. 
  Clinical DBP (sitting, trough). 
Edarbi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 38/88
 
 
 
 
 
  Other ABPM parameters of SBP and DBP: Daytime (6 AM-10 PM), nighttime (12 AM-6 AM), the 
0 to 12 hour interval after dosing, and trough (the 22-24 hour interval after dosing). 
 
Proportion of responders based on the 3 following categories: 
o  SBP  responders:  Subjects  with  a  reduction  in  clinical  SBP  to  <140  mm  Hg  and/or  a 
≥20 mm Hg decrease from Baseline. 
o  SBP responders: Subjects with a reduction in clinical DBP to <90 mm Hg and/or a ≥10 
mm Hg decrease from Baseline. 
o 
Joint SBP  and  DBP  responders:  Subjects  with  blood  pressure  reductions  meeting  both 
criterion for SBP and DBP. 
o  Trough-to-peak  ratios  and  placebo-corrected  trough-to-peak  ratios  were  also 
calculated based on ABPM data. As described above, the trough interval was defined as 
the last 2 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval; the peak effect interval was the 2-hour 
interval in which the maximum decrease from Baseline was observed. 
The decision for a 24 hour ABPM systolic blood pressure as primary endpoint is considered appropriate 
based  on  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of 
hypertension as it provides a better insight into blood pressure changes during everyday activities and 
is  strongly  recommended  for  the  evaluation  of  new  antihypertensive  agents.  However,  the  guideline 
also  states  that  there  is  still  insufficient  evidence  to  accept  ABPM  as  the  sole  basis  of  efficacy. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed with the choice of clinical SBP at trough as the major secondary endpoint 
to  comply  with  the  current  view  of  the  guideline.  The  proportion  of  responders  is  also  considered  an 
important  endpoint.  Furthermore,  trough-to-peak  ratio  is  considered  important  in  relation  to  24  hour 
maintenance of blood pressure lowering capacity. 
Randomisation 
All  controlled,  phase  3  monotherapy  efficacy  studies  and  FDC  study  TAK-491CLD-306  incorporated  a 
randomized,  double-blind  study  design.  In  each  study  (except  for  491-020  and  491-011), 
randomization  was  stratified  by  race  (Black  and  non-Black)  to  ensure  equal  representation  of  Black 
subjects  across  treatment  groups.  Enrollment  in  study  491-020  was  stratified  by  region  (Europe  and 
Russia). Study 491-011 enrolled a Black population only. 
Randomization  personnel  of  the  applicant  or  designee  generated  the  randomization  schedule.  All 
randomization information was stored in a secure area, accessible only by authorized personnel. 
General randomisation and stratification for Black or non Black race is considered appropriate. General 
randomisation procedures are considered appropriate. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  following  procedures  applied  to  all  randomization  studies.  The  study  medication  blind  was 
maintained  using  the  IVRS,  which  was  accessed  by  the  study  sites  for  randomization  number  and 
study  medication  assignments.  The  study  medication  blind  was  not  to  be  broken  by  the  investigator 
unless  information  concerning  the  study  medication  was  necessary  for  the  medical  treatment  of  the 
subject. If possible, the applicant was to be notified before the study medication blind was broken. If a 
medical  emergency  requiring  unblinding  occurred,  the  investigator  or  designee  at  the  site  was  to 
contact the applicant to assess the necessity to break the study medication blind. The study medication 
blind could have been obtained by authorized personnel accessing the IVRS. 
Edarbi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 39/88
 
 
 
 
 
If  the  investigator  was  unblinded,  study  medication  was  to  be  stopped  immediately  and  the  subject 
was to be withdrawn from the study. 
The  standard  procedure  used  for  assuring  blinding  of  study  medication  and  patients  was  sufficiently 
secured.  
Statistical methods 
The  primary  analyses  of  24-hour  mean  and  clinical  SBP  were  based  on  the  FAS.  For  endpoints 
evaluated at multiple post-baseline time points, missing data were imputed using the last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) principle. Only post-baseline data were carried forward. 
The primary analysis model was an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment as fixed effect and 
Baseline as covariate. The following statistics were provided: the least squares (LS) mean change from 
Baseline, LS mean treatment difference for the change from Baseline (i.e. TAK-491 – comparator), and 
the  95%  confidence  interval  and  P-value  for  the  LS  mean  treatment  difference.  All  tests  were 
conducted as 2-sided and assessed at the 0.05 significance level. 
All  analyses  of  other  secondary  endpoints  that  were  continuous  variables  used  an  ANCOVA  model 
similar to that used for the primary and key secondary endpoints. A logistic model with treatment as 
fixed  effect  and  baseline  clinical  SBP  as  a  covariate  was  used  to  analyze  the  response  criteria  for 
clinical  SBP.  The  odds  ratio  and  its  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  were  estimated.  A  similar  logistic 
model was used to analyze the response criteria for clinical DBP and the joint response criteria for both 
clinical SBP and DBP. 
Studies 491-008, 491-019, 491-020, and 491-301 incorporated step-wise testing procedures to control 
for  type  1  error  in  the  setting  of  multiple  comparisons  for  the  analyses  of  the  primary  and  key 
secondary endpoints. Within the framework of the stepwise analysis each dose of TAK-491 (highest to 
lowest) was compared with placebo first (when applicable). Then, if all TAK-491  doses were found to 
be  superior  to  placebo,  TAK-491  was  assessed  for  non-inferiority  and  superiority  with  active 
comparator(s). The testing sequence proceeded until the condition of a given step was not met. Type 1 
error  was  controlled  separately  for  the  analyses  of  24-hour  SBP  and  clinical  SBP.  A  stepwise  testing 
procedure  was  also  used  to  control  for  type 1  error  for  the  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint 
(change from Baseline to Weeks 6 and 10 in clinical SBP) in FDC study 491CLD-306.  
In studies 491-009, 491-010, and 491-011, type 1 error was controlled via closed testing. Under this 
principle, if the hypothesis that “all treatment groups are equal” was rejected at the 0.05 level (ie, the 
overall P-value <0.05), then the pairwise comparisons proceeded with no P-value adjustments. 
No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made in the analyses of the other secondary endpoints 
or  in  the  subgroup  analyses  of  any  endpoint;  therefore,  nominal  P-values  are  presented  for  these 
analyses. 
The statistical methods used are considered acceptable. They allow step-wise comparison of efficacy of 
azilsartan medoxomil versus placebo and active-comparator without the need for inflating the sample 
size  unacceptably  because  of  repetitive  testing.  The  statistical  programme  does  not  foresee  an 
evaluation of the dose response – or differential effect between azilsartan medoxomil doses used.

Specific issues applying to studies 491-008 and 491-019: short-term efficacy studies versus 
placebo 
Study  491-008  is  a  multicenter,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo  and  active-controlled,  parallel-
group study with the primary objective to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of TAK-491 compared to 
placebo  and  olmesartan  medoxomil  (olmesartan)  in  adults  after  6  weeks  of  treatment.  This  was  the 
only Phase 3 study to address the 20mg dose. 
Study  491-019  is  a  multicenter,  randomized,  parallel-group,  double-blind,  placebo  and  active-
controlled titration study with the primary objective to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of TAK-491 
compared with placebo, olmesartan, and valsartan after 6 weeks of treatment. 
Methods 
Study participants 
140 sites for study 491-008 and 131 sites for study 491-019 enrolled subjects in the United States and 
in Latin America. 
Treatments 
The total duration of study 491-008 was approximately 11 weeks, including up to 14 days of screening, 
followed  by  a  14-day  (minimum  10-day)  single-blind  placebo  Run-in  Period,  a  6-week  double-blind 
treatment Period, and a safety follow-up telephone call at 1 week after last dose of study drug. 
After a 2-week run-in period of single-blind placebo, subjects who met the entry criteria for study 491-
019  were  randomized  to  receive  TAK-491  20  mg,  TAK-491  40  mg,  valsartan  160  mg,  olmesartan  20 
mg,  or  placebo  for  2  weeks.  At  the  end  of  2  weeks,  subjects  were  force-titrated  to  the  higher  dose: 
TAK-491 40 mg or 80 mg, valsartan 320 mg, olmesartan 40 mg, or remained on placebo, respectively. 
Subjects remained at the higher dosage for the remainder of the study. ABPM occurred on Day -1 for 
24 hours prior to the first dose of  double-blind study medication and at Week 6 or Early Termination 
for 24 hours following the last administration of study medication. Clinical DBP and SBP were measured 
at screening, randomization, Week 2, Week 4, and Week 6. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  study  491-008  was  to  evaluate  the  antihypertensive  effect  of  TAK-491 
compared with placebo and olmesartan after 6 weeks of treatment. 
The  primary  objective  of  study  491-019  was  to  evaluate  the  antihypertensive  effect  of  TAK-491 
compared with placebo, olmesartan, and valsartan after 6 weeks of treatment. 
Sample size 
For  study  491-008,  assuming  an  SD  of  13  mm  Hg  for  mean  change  from  Baseline  in  24-hour  mean 
SBP by ABPM and a 15% dropout rate, a total of approximately 1260 enrolled subjects (280 per TAK-
491  and  olmesartan  treatment  groups  and  140  for  placebo  treatment  group)  was  calculated  to  be 
sufficient  for  achieving  at  least  90%  power  to  detect  a  difference  of  5.5  mm  Hg  between  the  active 
treatment groups and placebo with a 2-sided significance level of 5%. 
Edarbi 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 41/88
 
 
 
 
 
For  study  491-019,  a  total  of  1305  enrolled  subjects  (290  per  TAK-491,  valsartan,  and  olmesartan 
treatment groups, and 145 for placebo treatment group) were needed. This sample size also provided 
approximately 90% power to detect a difference of 4 mm Hg between TAK-491 and olmesartan by a 2-
sample  t-test  of  the  mean  change  from  Baseline  in  24-hour  mean  SBP  by  ABPM  with  a  2-sided 
significance level of 5%. 
Randomisation 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  race  (Black  and  non-Black)  to  ensure  equal  representation  of  Black 
subjects across treatment groups. Randomization personnel of the applicant or designee generated the 
randomization schedule. All randomization information was stored in a secure area, accessible only by 
authorized personnel. 
Blinding (masking) 
For study 491-008, the study medication consisted of 3 tablets (TAK-491 and matching placebo for the 
3 treatment arms of TAK-491) and 1 capsule (olmesartan and matching placebo) and was identical in 
appearance because of the encapsulation of the olmesartan tablets with matching placebo capsules. 
Statistical methods 
Similar statistics were used for both trials. All statistical tests were 2-sided and results were presented 
with  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  and  P-values  at  the  5%  significance  level.  To  control  the  type  1 
error  in  these  multiple  treatment  group  comparisons,  a  pre-specified  sequential  testing  procedure  of 
pair  wise  comparisons  was  applied  to  compare  the  3  active  treatment  groups  with  placebo  and  with 
olmesartan  in  study  491-008.  For  the  active  comparisons  pooled  analyses,  non-inferiority  analyses 
were  followed  by  superiority  analyses.  For  both  the  placebo  and  active  comparisons,  TAK-491  80  mg 
was  tested  first  followed  by  TAK-491  40  mg.  Tests  for  superiority  were  conducted  at  the 
0.05 significance  level;  the  non-inferiority  margin  was  the  same  as  that  applied  to  the  individual 
studies (ie, 1.5 mm Hg). Type I error was controlled separately for 24-hour mean SBP and clinical SBP.

Outcomes and estimation 
Figure 3.  24h mean reduction in SBP and clinical SBP at week 6 in studies 491-008 and 491-
019 
Responder rates 
In  the  pooled  analyses  the  responder  rates  for clinical  SBP  for  placebo,  TAK-491  40  mg,  TAK-491  80 
mg and olmesartan 40 mg were 57 of 288 (19.3%), 291 of 545 (51.9%), 314 of 549 (55.4%) and 287 
of 572 (50.2%) respectively. Responder rates were significantly higher against placebo (p<0.001) for 
all treatment arms. Only the 80 mg dose azilsartan medoxomil responder rate was significantly higher 
(p=0.035) versus olmesartan responder rate. 
Significant  blood  pressure  reduction  versus  placebo  was  demonstrated.  Only  the  highest  dose  was 
superior  in  BP  reduction  compared  to  olmesartan.  Superiority  could  also  be  demonstrated  versus 
valsartan for the 40 mg  dose and the highest dose. A larger proportion of responders  were observed 
for  the  highest  dose  based  on  the  clinical  SBP  versus  the  comparator  olmesartan.  Maximum  blood 
pressure was observed after 4 weeks of treatment, similar to olmesartan. A slightly better trough-to-
peak ratio could be observed in study 491-008, however, in study 491-019 a slightly better ratio was 
observed  for  olmesartan.  This  indicates  that  24  h  blood  pressure  lowering  efficacy  maintenance  was 
not better for azilsartan medoxomil than for olmesartan and was not based on azilsartan medoxomil’s 
pharmacokinetic profile. An alternative explanation could be a better pharmacodynamic profile.

Ancillary analyses 
Overall, subgroups demonstrated consistent efficacy across subgroups versus olmesartan. Olmesartan 
and azilsartan medoxomil are both ARBs which can be expected to have similar effects. In addition, the 
subgroup  analyses  versus  placebo  also  showed  consistent  results  except  for  the  age  group  of  >75 
years of age and for the black population. It is expected that the black population would respond less 
due  to  less  RAAS  activation  compared  to  a  white  population  of  patients.  It  would  be  informative  to 
know how patients with additional CV risk factors responded to antihypertensive therapy. 
Specific issues applying to studies 491-301 and 491-020: long-term efficacy studies versus 
comparators 
Methods 
Study 491-020 was a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study in subjects 
with essential hypertension (sitting SBP between 150 and 180 mm Hg, inclusive). TAK-491 (40 or 80 
mg)  was  compared  versus  ramipril  10 mg  once  daily  during  a  24-week  treatment  period;  each 
treatment was force titrated from a low to high dose at week 2. After a 2-week run-in period of single 
blind  placebo,  eligible  subjects  were  randomized  to  receive  TAK-491  20 mg  or  ramipril  2.5  mg  for 
2 weeks.  Forced  titration  to  a  higher  dose  occurred  at  Week  2:  TAK-491  20mg  was  titrated  to  40 or 
80 mg  and  ramipril  2.5  mg  was  titrated  to  10  mg.  Subjects  remained  at  the  higher  active  treatment 
dose for the remaining 22 weeks of the study. Clinic blood pressure was measured at each visit. ABPM 
was  performed  on  Day  -1,  before  initiation  of  treatment,  and  at  Week  24,  although  a  qualifying 
baseline ABPM was not required. 
Study 491-301 was a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAK-491 compared to valsartan over a 6-month treatment 
period in subjects with essential hypertension (trough clinical sitting SBP ≥150 mm Hg and ≤180 mm 
Hg on Day -1 and 24-hour mean SBP ≥130 mm Hg and ≤170 mm Hg on Day 1). Subsequent to the 6-
month double-blind treatment period, subjects could have continued in an optional 28-week open-label 
extension phase with TAK-491 to contribute to the long-term safety evaluation. 
Study participants 
For study 491-020, 101 sites enrolled subjects in Europe and in Russia. For study 491-301, 103 sites 
enrolled subjects into the placebo run-in period in the United States and in Latin America. 
Treatments 
The  total  duration  of  study  491-020  was  up  to  32  weeks,  including  up  to  28  days  of  screening  (with 
washout for any antihypertensive medication, followed by a 14-day single-blind placebo run-in period, 
a  24-week  double-blind  treatment  period,  and  a  safety  follow-up  telephone  call  at  1  week  after  last 
dose of study drug.

Figure 4.  Study 491-020 
For  study  491-301,  after  a  2-week  run-in  period  of  single-blind  placebo,  subjects  who  met  the  entry 
criteria were randomized to receive TAK-491 20 mg once daily (QD) force titrated to 40 mg QD after 2 
weeks,  TAK-491  20  mg  QD  force  titrated  to  80  mg  QD  after  2  weeks,  or  valsartan  80  mg  QD  force 
titrated  to  320  mg  QD  after  2  weeks,  with  treatment  for  6  months.  ABPM  occurred  on  Day  -1  for  24 
hours  prior  to  the  first  dose  of  double-blind  study  medication,  at  Week  8,  and  at  Week  24  or  Early 
Termination  for  24  hours  following  the  last  administration  of  double-blind  study  medication.  Clinical 
DBP and SBP were measured at Screening (Day -21/-28, Day -14, Day -7, Day -1). 
Figure 5.  Study 491-301 
Objectives 
The primary objective for study 491-020 was to evaluate the change in clinical systolic blood pressure 
(SBP)  in  response  to  TAK-491  compared  with  ramipril  for  6  months  in  subjects  with  essential 
hypertension.  
The  primary  objective  for  study  491-301  was  to  evaluate  the  antihypertensive  effect  of  TAK-491 
compared with valsartan 320 mg after 6 months of treatment, as measured by the primary endpoint of 
change  in  24-hour  mean  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  by  ambulatory  blood  pressure  monitoring 
(ABPM). 
Sample size 
For  study  491-020  a  minimum  of  810  subjects  were  to  be  randomized  (270  per  treatment  group)  to 
achieve at least 90% power to detect a difference of 4.75 mm Hg between TAK-491 treatment groups 
and  ramipril    (with  a  2-sided  significance  level  of  5%)  with  the  assumed  standard  deviation  of  14.5 
mmHg and 20% dropout rate. There was at least 90% power for demonstrating non-inferiority with a 
margin of 1.5 mm Hg between TAK-491 and ramipril on the mean change from baseline in SBP.

CHMP assessment report

For  study  491-30  a  total  of  approximately  972  subjects  were  to  be  randomized  (324  per  treatment 
group)  to  achieve  at  least  90%  power  to  detect  a  difference  of  4.25  mm  Hg  between  TAK-491 
treatment  groups  and  valsartan  (with  a  2-sided  significance  level  of  5%)  with  the  assumed  standard 
deviation  of 13  mmHg  for  mean  change  from  baseline  in  24-h  mean  SBP  by  ABPM  and  30%  dropout 
rate.  There  was  at  least  90%  power  for  demonstrating  non-inferiority  with  a  margin  of  1.5  mm  Hg 
between TAK-491 and valsartan on both primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Randomisation 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  race  (Black  and  non-Black)  to  ensure  equal  representation  of  Black 
subjects across treatment groups. Randomization personnel of the applicant or designee generated the 
randomization schedule. All randomization information was stored in a secure area, accessible only by 
authorized personnel. 
Blinding (masking) 
For study 491-020, the study medication consisted of 3 tablets (TAK-491 and matching placebo) and 1 
capsule (ramipril and matching placebo) and was identical in appearance because of the encapsulation 
of the ramipril tablets with matching placebo capsules.

Conduct of the study 
Protocols  were  amended  extensively  for  both  studies  and  similar  calculation  errors  as  in  previous 
studies of cGFR were observed and corrected. In study 491-020 there were 63 subjects with at least 1 
major  protocol  deviation  (excluding  them  from  PPS  analyses).  In  study  491-301  there  were  108 
(11.0%)  subjects  with  at  least  1  major  protocol  deviation  (excluding  them  from  PPS  analyses).  The 
most common major protocol deviations were receipt of prohibited medication (72 subjects), subjects 
that had a baseline 24-hour mean SBP <130 mm Hg (17 subjects), and study drug compliance <80% 
(10 subjects).

Although some slight differences between treatment groups is noted, in general, randomisation seems 
successful.  Sufficient  subjects  older  than  65  years  are  included.  However,  only  limited  numbers  of 
patients of 75 years and older are included. Also the numbers of patients with diabetes included in the 
studies is limited.

Significant  more  systolic  blood  pressure  reduction  was  demonstrated  for  both  doses  of  azilsartan 
medoxomil 40 and 80 mg compared to valsartan and ramipril. These results were consistent with the 
reduction  in  diastolic  blood  pressure.  Also  responder  rates  demonstrated  consistent  results  in  this 
respect.  However,  only  minor  increments  in  BP  lowering  were  observed  with  the  80mg  compared  to 
the 40 mg dose. The responder rate in clinical SBP for the 80 mg group was slightly higher. 
Ancillary analyses 
Consistent  findings  were  observed  for  the  blood  pressure  lowering  according  to  subgroups.  The  only 
exception is less efficacy in the >75 years of age subgroup, although the confidence interval was wide 
due to limited number of patients. It would be informative to know how patients with additional CV risk 
factors responded to antihypertensive therapy.

Specific  issues  applying  to  studies  491-009,  491-010  and  491-306:  Efficacy  studies  during 
co-administration 
Methods 
Study  491-009  was  a  phase  3,  multicenter,  randomized,  parallel-group,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  TAK-491  when  co-administered  with 
chlorthalidone  25  mg  once  daily  (QD)  in  subjects  with  essential  hypertension.  After  a  2-week  Run-In 
Period of single-blind placebo, subjects who met the entry criteria were randomized to receive placebo 
plus  chlorthalidone  25  mg  QD  (chlorthalidone  monotherapy),  TAK-491  40  mg  QD  plus  chlorthalidone 
25 mg QD, or TAK-491 80 mg QD plus chlorthalidone 25 mg QD for 6 weeks. ABPM occurred on Day -1 
for  24  hours  prior  to  the  first  dose  of  double-blind  study  medication  and  at  Week  6  or  Early 
Termination  for  24  hours  following  the  last  administration  of  study  medication.  Clinical  SBP  and  DBP 
were measured at Screening, randomization, Week 2, Week 4, and Week 6. 
Study  491-010  was  a  phase  3,  multicenter,  randomized,  parallel-group,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAK-491 when combined with amlodipine 5 mg 
once  daily  (QD)  in  subjects  with  essential  hypertension  (trough  clinical  sitting  SBP ≥160  mm  Hg  and 
≤190 mm Hg and 24-hour mean SBP ≥140 mm Hg and≤180 mm Hg). After a 2-week run-in period of  
single-blind  placebo,  subjects  who  met  the  entry  criteria  were  randomized  to  receive  placebo  plus 
amlodipine  5  mg  QD,  TAK-491  40  mg  QD  plus  amlodipine  5  mg  QD,  or  TAK-491  80  mg  QD  plus 
amlodipine  5  mg  QD  for  6  weeks.  ABPM  occurred  on  Day  -1  for  24  hours  prior  to  the  first  dose  of 
double-blind  study  medication  and  at  Week  6  or  Early  Termination  for  24  hours  following  the  last 
administration of study medication. Clinical DBP and SBP were measured at Screening, randomization 
(Day 1), Week 2, Week 4, and Week 6. 
Study  491-306  was  a  phase  3,  multicenter,  double-blind,  randomized,  parallel-group  efficacy  and 
safety  study  evaluating  TAK-491  in  FDC  with  chlorthalidone  compared  with  TAK-491  co-administered 
with HCTZ over 10 weeks of treatment, which included a 2-week single-blind monotherapy treatment 
period  and  an  8-week  double-blind  treatment  period,  in  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  essential 
hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 160 and 190 mm Hg, inclusive. After a 
2-week  Single-Blind  Placebo  Run-In  Period,  subjects  who  met  the  entry  criteria  were  randomized  to 
receive  single-blind  treatment  starting  on  Day  1  consisting  of  TAK-491  40  mg  and  double-blind 
treatment starting at the end of Week 2, consisting of FDC of TAK-491 40 mg and chlorthalidone 12.5 
mg  (TAK-491CLD  40  mg/12.5  mg)  or  TAK-491  40  mg  plus  HCTZ  12.5  mg  (TAK-491  40  mg  +  HCTZ 
12.5 mg). For subjects who did not achieve target blood pressure by Week 6, the dose of TAK-491CLD 
40  mg/12.5  mg  was  titrated  to  TAK-491CLD  40  mg/25  mg  and  the  dose  of  TAK-491  40  mg  +  HCTZ 
12.5  mg  was  titrated  to  TAK-491  40  mg  +  HCTZ  25  mg.  Subjects  who  achieved  both  SBP  and  DBP 
targets by Week 6 continued to receive TAK-491CLD 40 mg/12.5 mg or TAK-491 40 mg + HCTZ 12.5 
mg for the duration of the study. 
Study Participants  
74  sites  for  study  491-009  and  65  sites  for  study  491-010  enrolled  subjects  into  the  placebo  run-in 
period  in  the  Unites  States  and  in  Latin  America.  For  study  491-306  66  sites  enrolled  subjects  in  the 
United States and in Russia

Objectives 
The primary objective of study 491-009 was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of TAK-491 when 
co-administered  with  chlorthalidone  compared  with  chlorthalidone  monotherapy,  as  measured  by  the 
primary  endpoint  of  24-hour  mean  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  by  ambulatory  blood  pressure 
monitoring (ABPM). 
The primary objective of study 491-010 was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of TAK-491 when 
co-administered with amlodipine compared with amlodipine monotherapy, as measured by the primary 
endpoint  of  24-hour  mean  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  by  ambulatory  blood  pressure  monitoring 
(ABPM). 
For study 491-306, the primary objective was to compare the antihypertensive effect of chlorthalidone 
versus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) when each was used in combination with TAK-491 in subjects with 
moderate to severe essential hypertension. 
Sample size 
For studies 491-009 and 491-010, 540 subjects were to be randomized (180 per group) to achieve at 
least 90% power to detect a difference of 5 mm Hg between the active treatment groups and placebo 
(with a 2-sided significance level of 5%). 
For study 491CLD-306, assuming a SD of 14 mmHg and a 15% drop-out rate, a total of 600 subjects 
was considered sufficient to achieve 90% power to detect a difference of 4 mmHg in the mean change 
from baseline in trough, sitting clinical SBP with 2 sided significance level of 5%. 
Randomisation 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  race  (Black  and  non-Black)  to  ensure  equal  representation  of  Black 
subjects across treatment groups. Randomization personnel of the applicant or designee generated the 
randomization schedule. All randomization information was stored in a secure area, accessible only by 
authorized personnel. 
Blinding (masking) 
For study 491-009, medication dispensed during the double-blind treatment period was dispensed as 2 
kits  and  1  bottle  at  randomization  and  1  kit  and  re-dispensed  bottle  at Visit  7.  The  daily  dose  during 
run-in was 2 placebo tablets. The daily dose during the double-blinded treatment period was 3 tablets: 
2 TAK-491 (active and placebo) and 1 chlorthalidone tablet. 
For  study  491-010,  the  daily  dose  during  run-in  was  2  placebo  tablets.  The  daily  dose  during  the 
double-blinded  treatment  period  was  3  tablets:  2  TAK-491  (active  and  placebo)  and  1  amlodipine 
tablet. 
Throughout  study  491-306,  chlorthalidone  (or  matching  placebo)  was  administered  in  an  FDC  with 
TAK-491  (i.e.  the  TAK-491CLD  FDC),  whereas  HCTZ  (or  matching  placebo)  was  administered  as  an 
individual capsule.

Recruitment 
Study  491-009  was  conducted  from  07  September  2007  until  05  March  2009.  Study  491-010  was 
conducted from 03 October 2007 until 03 April 2009. Study 491-306 was conducted from 20 January 
2009 until 30 November 2009. 
Conduct of the study 
For study 491-009, there were 68 subjects with at least 1 major protocol violation, which included the 
following  categories:  study  drug  compliance  outside  the  acceptable  range  of  80%  to  120%,  baseline 
24-hour mean SBP <140 mm Hg, prohibited medication use, and wrong treatment received, excluding 
them  from  PPS  analyses.  The  number  of  subjects  with  major  protocol  deviations  across  treatment 
groups ranged between 20 (10.9%) and 25 (13.5%) subjects. Five subjects withdrew from the study 
due to major protocol deviations; each of these subjects failed to meet the SBP entrance criteria and 
were discontinued after randomization. 
For  study  491-010,  there  were  56  subjects  (9.9%)  with  at  least  1  major  protocol  deviation,  with  a 
similar percentage in each group excluding them from PPS analyses. The most common major protocol 
deviations  were  receipt  of  prohibited  medication  (21  subjects)  and  subjects  that  had  a  Baseline  24-
hour mean SBP <140 mm Hg (16 subjects). 
For study 491CLD-306, there were 29 subjects with at least 1 major protocol violation, which included 
the  following  categories:  treatment/dosing  violation,  study  drug  compliance  outside  the  acceptable 
range  of  80%  to  120%,  and  prohibited  medication  use.  As  such,  data  from  these  subjects  were  not 
eligible for inclusion in the PPS analyses. A listing by subject and summary of reasons that individual 
subjects  were  excluded  from  the  PPS  analyses  are  presented  in  Appendix  16.2.3  and  Table  15.1.5, 
respectively.  Four  subjects  withdrew  from  the  study  due  to  major  protocol  deviations;  each  of  these 
subjects had unsuccessful ABPM measurements and were discontinued after randomization.

Some  differences  appear  within  study  491-009  and  491-010.  There  are  some  differences  between 
treatment groups for gender. Whether this could have influenced results remains questionable. Within 
the other placebo controlled trials no difference for race subgroup was observed.

An ITT procedure was followed.

Both the 40 mg and 80 mg azilsartan medoxomil demonstrated additional efficacy when combined with 
amlodipine  or  chlorthalidone.  However  the  80  mg  azilsartan  medoxomil  could  not  demonstrate  more 
blood  pressure  lowering  in  combination  than  the  40  mg  azilsartan  medoxomil  in  combination  with 
either  additional  antihypertensives.  The  fixed  dose  combination  of  40  mg  azilsartan  medoxomil  with 
CLD  12.5  mg  had  significantly  larger  SBP  reduction  when  measured  clinically  (primary  endpoint)  but 
comparable  BP  lowering  efficacy  as  40  mg  azilsartan  medoxomil  combined  with  12.5  mg  HCTZ  when 
measured as 24h SBP reduction. 
Ancillary analyses 
Consistent with the results of the primary endpoint the proportion of responders in the highest 80 mg 
group was less than with the 40 mg group in study 491-009. In study 491-010, slightly more patients 
on  the  highest  azilsartan  medoxomil  dose  responded  while  blood  pressure  lowering  was  comparable 
with the 40 mg dose  This questions the additional efficacy with the highest dose in combination with 
other antihypertensives. 
Also for the patients on the FDC the proportion requiring addition of high dose HCTZ is consistent with 
the blood pressure achieved. 
Summary of main studies 
The  following  tables  summarise  the  efficacy  results  from  the  main  studies  supporting  the  present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pooled  analyses  were  used  to  explore  the  sub-group  differences  and  have  been  described  above 
together with the individual studies. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
A  separate  placebo-controlled,  phase  3  study  (study  491-011)  was  completed  to  characterize  the 
efficacy  of  TAK-491  monotherapy  in  a  study  of  Black  subjects  with  mild  to  moderate  essential 
hypertension. The study was similar in design as the placebo-controlled short term trials 491-008 and 
491-019. This trial demonstrated less efficacy compared to the other two trials. This is not unexpected 
as  only  a  black  population  was  included.  However,  a  clinically  and  statistically  significant  BP  lowering 
efficacy compared to placebo was demonstrated. 
Supportive studies 
The 24-week, controlled study 491-301 was extended with a 28 week extension part to evaluate open-
label  long-term  maintenance  of  antihypertensive  effect  during  chronic  administration  of  TAK-491 
during  52  weeks,  and  the  2  uncontrolled,  open-label  studies  (491-006  for  56  weeks,  491-016  for  26 
weeks) provided additional long-term experience. The study designs and objectives are appropriate to 
allow  both  scheduled  treatment  intensification  and  regular  assessment  of  tolerability  of  proper 
antihypertensive  therapy.  Sufficient  number  of  patients  were  analysed  to  comply  with  the  power 
calculation. A larger proportion of diabetic patients was included in the open-label studies. However, as 
with the randomised studies, a limited proportion of patients older than 75 years of age was included. 
A more severe hypertensive patient group was included in the open-label phase in conformity with the 
inclusion criteria.  
Studies  491-016  and  491-006  demonstrated  that  TAK-491  efficacy  was  maintained  during  the  study 
period followed. However, for study 491-301, blood pressure lowering capacity slightly diminished from 
week 28 until the end of the study period. Addition of CLD or HCT resulted in additional blood pressure 
lowering.  Maintenance of efficacy was further demonstrated with the reversal phase in study 491-016 
where treatment continuation was associated with significant larger blood pressure reduction compared 
to patients assigned to placebo, who demonstrated loss of blood pressure lowering effect.

2.5.3  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  applicant  conducted  an  elaborate  clinical  programme  to  support  both  monotherapy  and  co-
administration  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  with  other  antihypertensives.  For  the  studies  performed  in 
patients  with  uncomplicated  essential  hypertension,  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  considered 
appropriate.  However,  a  relatively  homogenous  patient  population  has  been  selected  with  limited  co-
morbidity.  
Sufficient  duration  has  been  applied  to  reach  maximum  blood  pressure  lowering  and  the  washout 
period used is considered sufficiently long to exclude a carry-over effect. In addition, suitable measures 
are  taken  to  exclude  patients  who  initially  do  not  comply  with  study  medication  intake.  The 
comparators,  one  ACE-inhibitor  (ramipril)  and  2  ARB’s  (olmesartan  and  valsartan)  can  be  considered 
as representative drugs of their class and are given at their maximum accepted dose.  
The  decision  to  use  24  hour  ABPM  systolic  blood  pressure  as  primary  endpoint  is  considered 
appropriate. In the revised guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of 
hypertension (CPMP/EWP/238/95 Rev. 3): ABPM is required for the evaluation of new antihypertensive 
agents. ABPM provides good insight into blood pressure changes during everyday activities. However, 
it  is  also  mentioned  that  measurements  with  a  calibrated  mercury  sphygmomanometer  are  still  the 
standard.  For  this  reason,  the  applicant  has  chosen  to  use  clinical  SBP  at  through  as  the  major 
secondary  endpoint  to  comply  with  the  current  view  of  the  guideline.  Also,  the  applicant  has  used 
clinical  SPB  as  primary  endpoint  in  some  of  the  trials  (studies  491-020  and  491CLD-306).  Other 
important  secondary  endpoints  (the  proportion  of  responders  and  trough-to-peak  ratio)  to  measure 
antihypertensive efficacy have also been taken into account. 
The statistical methods used are considered appropriate. The hierarchical test procedure is considered 
appropriate to allow multiple testing without requiring tightening of the p-value.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  applicant  demonstrated  significant  blood  pressure  reduction  versus  placebo  in  the  short-term  6 
weeks monotherapy trials for dose range of 20 – 80 mg. Superiority of azilsartan medoxomil could be 
demonstrated versus valsartan for both the 40 mg and the 80 mg azilsartan medoxomil dose, whereas 
only  the  highest  dose  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  (80  mg)  was  superior  in  reducing  BP  compared  to 
olmesartan 40 mg. A larger proportion of responders was observed for the highest 80 mg dose based 
on the clinical SBP versus the comparator olmesartan. A significant effect was present after two weeks 
and  maximal  blood  pressure  lowering  efficacy  was  observed  after  4  weeks  of  treatment,  similar  to 
olmesartan.  In  addition,  the  subgroup  analyses  versus  placebo  also  showed  consistent  results  except 
for the age group of >75 years of age and for the black population. However, it was expected that the 
Black  population  would  respond  less  due  to  less  RAAS  activation  compared  to  White.  This  was 
observed in study 491-011 where only black patients were included.  
In  the  long-term  (24  weeks)  comparative  studies,  azilsartan  medoxomil  40  and  80  mg  (both  doses) 
reduced  systolic  blood  pressure  significantly  more  than  valsartan  and  ramipril.  Reduction  in  diastolic 
blood  pressure  and  responder  rates  were  consistent  with  these  results.  However,  the  80  mg  appears 
not to have greater response than the 40 mg dose azilsartan medoxomil as BP and responder rates are 
only marginally higher. This is probably due to the shallow dose response curve often seen with ARBs. 
Again,  consistent  findings  were  observed  for  the  blood  pressure  lowering  across  subgroups.

In  the  co-administration  studies,  both  the  40  mg  and  80  mg  azilsartan  medoxomil  demonstrated 
additional efficacy when combined with amlodipine, chlorthalidone and HCTZ (the latter only for SBP). 
However,  80  mg  azilsartan  medoxomil  did  not  reduce  blood  pressure  more  than  40  mg  azilsartan 
medoxomil when co-administered with either AML or CLD. A higher discontinuation rate was observed 
when  azilsartan  medoxomil  was  combined  with  CLD  versus  CLD  alone  compared  to  combination  of 
azilsartan medoxomil with HCTZ or amlodipine versus monotherapy. 
The  long-term  open-label  studies,  studies  491-016  and  491-006  demonstrated  that  TAK-491  efficacy 
was  maintained  during  the  entire  study  period.  However,  in  study  301  (open-label  extension  of 
azilsartan  medoxomil  monotherapy),  blood  pressure  lowering  capacity  slightly  diminished  from  week 
28  to  end  of  study  period.  Nevertheless,  when  CLD,  amlodipine  or  HCT  were  added  this  resulted  in 
additional  blood  pressure  lowering  in  all  of  these  long-term  studies.  To  obtain  more  insight  in  the 
numbers  of  responders  after  each  treatment  step,  the  applicant  has  provided  results  of  patients  not 
initially  responding  to  a  40  mg  dose  and  who  were  then  titrated  up  to  the  80  mg  dose.  Additional 
efficacy  of  approximately  5  mmHg  was  shown  for  these  patients,  best  reflecting  the  benefit  of  the 
highest dose in clinical practice. The benefit in this non-responder subgroup of all patients who were up 
titrated to 80 mg was clearly more pronounced. The analysis supports a step-wise up-titration.  
Maintenance  of  efficacy  was  further  demonstrated  with  the  reversal  phase  in  study  491-016  where 
treatment  continuation  was  associated  with  significant  larger  blood  pressure  reduction  compared  to 
patients assigned to placebo, who demonstrated loss of blood pressure lowering effect. 
The  clinical  trial  programme  is  considered  appropriate  to  evaluate  the  antihypertensive  efficacy  with 
and without other antihypertensives in patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension up 
to 75 years of age, both in men and women. A more severe hypertensive patients group was included 
in the open-label phase conform with the inclusion criteria and a sufficient number of severe patients 
were  analyzed  to  assess  antihypertensive  efficacy.  Only  limited  data  were  obtained  in  complicated 
patients,  i.e.  patients  with  co-morbidity  such  as  patients  with  DM  and  heart  failure,  patients  at  high 
risk  for  cardiovascular  disease,  and  the  very  elderly  (>75  years).  In  particular,  in  the  very  elderly 
patient  azilsartan  medoxomil  showed  to  be  slightly  less  efficacious.  Other  important  subgroups,  e.g. 
patients with diabetes mellitus, heart failure or who had activated RAAS were too small to be able to 
draw  conclusions.  This  limits  external  validity  of  the  clinical  programme.  The  uncertainty  of  the 
information in these populations has been addressed in the SmPC through the inclusion of cautionary 
statements, in particular the recommendation to consider a starting dose of 20 mg instead of 40 mg in 
these populations. This is reasonable as azilsartan medoxomil is a drug in a class of antihypertensive 
agents  with  a  well-known  mechanism  of  action  (AT1  antagonism).  Patients  with  pre-existent 
cardiovascular events/co-morbidities were allowed in the studies. The applicant analysed the efficacy in 
high risk population according to the classes of CV risk stratification as proposed in the ESC and ESH 
guidelines showing similar efficacy with the overall population. 
2.5.4  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Azilsartan  medoxomil  is  a  new  drug  in  the  well  known  class  of  AT1  antagonists.  Antihypertensive 
efficacy  with  and  without  other  antihypertensives  (diuretics  and  amlodipine)  in  patients  with 
uncomplicated mild to severe hypertension up to 75 years of age has been demonstrated for the dose 
range  of  20  –  80  mg  of  azilsartan  medoxomil,  both  in  short  term  and  long  term  studies.  The  40  mg 
dose  is  considered  an  acceptable  starting  dose  in  these  patients.  The  benefit/risk  of  azilsartan 
medoxomil  80mg  dose  showed  additional  benefit  over  the  40  mg  dose  with  respect  to  BP  lowering 
efficacy.  A  limitation  of  the  dossier  is  the  paucity  of  data  in  complicated  patients,patients  with  co-
morbidities such as DM and heart failure, and the very elderly both in terms of efficacy and safety. In 
the SmPC it is recommended to lower the starting dose to 20 mg in such populations.

Sufficient  numbers  of  patients  have  been  included  to  evaluate  long-term  safety:  1704  patients  for 
more  than  26  weeks  and  588  patients  for  more  than  48  weeks.  Although  the  ICH  E1  guideline 
“Population Exposure: The extent of Population Exposure to assess Clinical Safety (CPMP/ICH/375/95)” 
stipulates  100  patients  should  be  treated  for  at  least  one  year,  this  slightly  shorter  period  seems 
acceptable as the total number of patients exposed long-term is much larger.

Adverse events  
Placebo controlled short term studies 
There  was  no  major  difference  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  with  respect  to  treatment  group  (placebo, 
azilsartan  medoxomil,  and  active  comparator),  although  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  seems  to  be 
slightly  higher  in  the  80  mg  dose  group.  Headache  was  the  most  common  AE  and  was  generally 
reported less frequently in azilsaran (20, 40, and 80 mg) groups (4.6%, 3.2%, and 5.6% in study 491-
008)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (7.0%  in  study  491-008).  Dyslipidaemia  was  the  only  other  AE 
reported in ≥ 5% of subjects in any of the treatment groups and was most found in the highest dose of 
azilsartan medoxomil (2.5-5.6%). AEs occurring in  2% of subjects in any group that were reported 
more  frequently  in  the  azilsartan  medoxomil  groups  than  in  the  placebo  group  included  dizziness, 
oedema  peripheral,  nasopharyngitis,  back  pain,  fatigue,  and  diarrhoea.  Diarrhoea,  dizziness  and 
fatigue were found to be related to study drug and seem to be dose-related: 0, 0.7 and 1.3%; 0.9, 1.9 
and 2.3%; and 0.2, 0.4 and 1.1% for placebo, azilsartan medoxomil 40 and 80 mg, respectively. 
Active controlled studies 
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  experienced  AEs  in  the  azilsartan  medoxomil  group  (40  and  80 mg) 
(53.7%)  was  slightly  higher  than  in  the  comparator  group  (49.4%),  and  was  not  dose  related. 
Headache  was  the  most  common  AE  with  similar  incidence  across  all  treatment  groups  (range  3.4-
10.1%). 
The  incidence  of  treatment  related  AEs  (TRAE)  was  generally  similar  between  azilsartan  medoxomil 
and  comparator.  In  case  of  a  TRAE  the  investigators  considered  the  AE  as  possibly,  probably,  or 
definitely related to study drug. Dizziness was the most commonly reported TRAE, which occurred at a 
higher  rate  in  the  azilsartan  medoxomil  group  (4.1%)  than  in  the  active  comparator  group  (1.9%). 
Overall,  there  was  no  difference  in  TRAE  incidence  between  azilsartan  medoxomil  at  40  and  80 mg. 
However,  the  incidence  of  TRAEs  hypotension,  dizziness  and  blood  CK  increased  were  higher  in  the 
azilsartan medoxomil arms and seemed dose-related (1.3%, 1.8%, and 0.8%; 3.9%, 4.3% and 1.9%; 
0.3%, 1.6% and 0.8% for azilsartan medoxomil 40 and 80 mg and comparator, respectively). Cough 
and  proteinuria  occurred  at  a  higher  rate  (3.6% and  1.1%)  in  the  comparator  than  in  the  azilsartan 
medoxomil group (0.7% and 0.2%, respectively). 
Comparison with other ARBs 
Events reported more often with azilsartan medoxomil compared with olmesartan were dyslipidaemia, 
diarrhoea,  and  UTI  in  the  short-term  studies.  Events  reported  more  often  with  azilsartan  medoxomil 
compared with valsartan were diarrhoea, dizziness, UTI, and fatigue in the 6-week study (study 491-
019);  and  headache,  dizziness,  UTI,  fatigue,  blood  CK  increased,  back  pain,  pain  in  extremity,  and 
bronchitis in the 24-week study (study 491-301). 
Events  reported  more  often  in  patients  treated  with  olmesartan  compared  with  azilsartan  medoxomil 
were  dizziness  (only  in  study  491-008),  fatigue,  and  peripheral  oedema.  Events  reported  more  often 
with valsartan compared with azilsartan medoxomil were headache, nausea, and peripheral oedema in 
the  6-week  study;  and  nasopharyngitis,  dyslipidaemia,  arthralgia,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection, 
haematuria, and proteinuria in the 24-week study.

Co-administration studies 
There  were  no  major  differences  across  treatment  groups  in  the  overall  frequency  of  AEs: 
chlorthalidone  (CLD)  monotherapy  (51.9%),  CLD  +  azilsartan  medoxomil  40  mg  co-administration 
(52.2%), and CLD+azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg co-administration (51.6%) in study 491-009. In study 
491-010 amlodipine (AML) monotherapy (46.5%), AML+azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg co-administration 
(48.4%)  and  AML+azilsartan  medoxomil  80  mg  co-administration  (39.9%).  In  study  491-306 
comparing  the  fixed  dose  combination  azilsartanmedoxomil-chloorthalidone  (52.3%)  and  azilsartan 
medoxomil co-administered with HCTZ (47.5%). 
The  most  common  AEs  across  these  studies  were  dizziness  and  headache.  The  incidence  of  dizziness 
was  dose  related  for  azilsartan  medoxomil  when  co-administered  with  chlorthalidone  but  not  with 
amlodipine. 
Overall  treatment  related  AE  incidences  were  24.7%  in  study  491-009,  14.6%  in  study  010,  and 
32.6% in study 491-306. The most frequent TRAEs included dizziness (azilsartan medoxomil 4.1% and 
comparator 1.9%), headache (3.0% and 2.9%), increased blood CK (1.0% and 0.8%), fatigue (1.7% 
and 1.5%), and hypotension (1.5% and 0.8%). 
Open-label studies 
The  adverse  event  profile  from  the  pooled  analyses  was  consistent  with  that  presented  for  the 
individual  studies,  with  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  AEs  than  in  controlled  studies  due  to  longer 
treatment  duration.  Overall,  66.7%  of  subjects  experienced  at  least  one  AE,  with  most  being  mild  or 
moderate in severity. Approximately half of subjects had AEs that occurred within the first 3 months of 
treatment.  TRAEs  occurring  in  at  least  2%  of  subjects  were  dizziness  (8.5%),  fatigue  (4.2%), 
headache  (3.5%),  blood  creatinine  increased  (2.4%),  and  hypotension  (2.5%).  Other  frequently 
reported  TRAEs  (1.1%  to  1.5%)  were  dizziness  postural,  blood  CK  increased,  hypokalaemia,  muscle 
spasms, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhoea, nausea, and hyperuricaemia. 
Hypotension and dizziness 
Incidence of hypotension and dizziness were also assessed over time. Patients treated with azilsartan 
medoxomil  had  roughly  a  two-fold  increased  probability  of  having  a  first  hypotensive  or  dizziness 
adverse event (see figures below).

Renal events 
Renal adverse events were observed in 0.5%, 0.7% and 0.6% in placebo, azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg 
and azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg treated patients in the short-term studies. In the long-term controlled 
studies this was 1.5%, 1.1% and 2.1% in the comparator, 40 and 80 mg azilsartan medoxomil groups. 
The detailed named adverse events were generally 0.1-0.2% (1 patient) for a specific treatment arm, 
except  for  blood  creatinine  increase  (0.2%,  0.6%  and  0.4%  in  short-term  studies  and  0,  0.6%  and 
1.1%  in  long-term  studies),  blood  urea  increased  (0,  0.6%  and  0.1%  in  short-term  studies  and  0, 
0.3% and 0.6% in long-term studies). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Short-term monotherapy placebo and active-controlled studies 
In monotherapy placebo-controlled studies, no SAE was reported by more than 1 subject in any single 
treatment  group  in  any  individual  study.  SAEs  resolved  for  all  but  1 subject,  who  died  due  to 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage and shock. Total numbers were 14, 14 and 4 for studies 491-008, 491-
491-019,  and  491-011  respectively.  The  percentage  of  subjects  with  SAEs,  by  treatment  group,  for 
studies  491-008,  491-019,  and  491-011,  respectively,  was  2.1%,  1.3%,  and  0  in  the  placebo  group; 
2.8%  in  the  azilsartan  medoxomil  20  mg  group  (study  491-008  only);  0,  0.7%,  and  2.2%  in  the 
azilsartan  medoxomil  40 mg  group;  and  0.4%,  1.1%,  and  0.7%  in  the  azilsartan  medoxomil  80  mg 
group. The percentage of subjects with SAEs was 0.7% (study 491-008) and 1.4% (study 491-019) in 
the  olmesartan  group,  and  1.1%  in  the  valsartan  group  (study  491-019).  SAE  incidences  did  not 
increase  with  dose  in  the  azilsartan  medoxomil  treatment  groups  and  were  not  disproportionately 
represented by a particular system organ class (SOC) or preferred term.  
Long-term active-controlled studies  
In long-term active-controlled studies, the most frequently reported SAE was fall, reported for 2 active 
comparator–treated subjects. Both events were accidental falls (e.g. slipping on wet surface) and not 
associated with hypotensive episodes, dizziness, or syncope.

Open-label studies 
In open-label studies, there were 64 (5.1%) of total subjects with at least 1 serious adverse event. The 
most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  noncardiac  chest  pain,  syncope,  and  hypotension  (3  subjects, 
0.2%, each). Treatment related SAEs were 6 (0.5%) in total. 
Co-administration studies 
The incidence of SAEs in co-administration studies was 7 (1.3%) in study 491-009, 4 (0.7%) in study 
491-010,  and  11  (1.8%)  in  study  7491-306.  The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  syncope  and 
renal failure. Syncope was reported for 3 subjects (2 received azilsartan medoxomil with chlorthalidone 
and  1 received  azilsartan  medoxomil  with  amlodipine),  1  of  which  was  associated  with  orthostatic 
hypotension. Renal failure was reported for 2 subjects (both received azilsartan medoxomil-CLD), 1 of 
whom had concurrent chronic kidney disease. 
Deaths 
A  total  of  10  deaths  occurred  during  the  whole  study  programme,  seven  were  considered 
cardiovascular  deaths.  Five  deaths  occurred  in  patients  treated  with  azilsartan  medoxomil;  one  in  a 
patient  receiving  TAK-536  (metabolite)  (assessed  as  non-related  to  study  drug);  two  in  placebo  and 
two in active control treated patients (olmesartan and valsartan). 
Three  of  the  5  deaths  associated  with  azilsartan  medoxomil  treatment  occurred  during  the  phase  3 
monotherapy  studies  in  which  4814 subjects  received  at  least  1  dose  of  azilsartan  medoxomil;  the  2 
other deaths occurred in the FDC programme (study 491CLD-306) in which all 605 subjects received at 
least  1 dose  of  azilsartan  medoxomil.  Four  deaths  occurred  in  subjects  who  received  azilsartan 
medoxomil alone, 1 in a subject who received azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg+chlorthalidone 12.5 mg. Of 
the 4 fatal SAEs in subjects treated with azilsartan medoxomil alone, 3 were considered not related to 
study  drug  and  1  (sudden  death;  491CLD-306/1023/024)  to  be  possibly  related  (see  description 
below). One subject died (sudden death) after having received treatment with azilsartan medoxomil for 
14  days  and  with  azilsartan  medoxomil  40 mg+chlorthalidone  12.5  mg  for  1  day.  The  event  was 
determined to be unrelated to study drug. 
Description of the single death possibly related to study drug: 
Subject  491CLD-306/1023/024  (azilsartan  medoxomil  40  mg),  a  61-year-old,  124  kg,  black  woman 
experienced  a  fatal  SAE  of  sudden  death  on  Day  6  of  the  active  (single-blind)  Treatment  Period.  An 
autopsy  was  not  performed  and  details  regarding  the  event  are  unknown.  Due  to  the  lack  of  a 
definitive  diagnosis,  the  event  was  recorded  as  possibly  related  to  study  medication  by  default.  The 
death  certificate  was  provided  and  reports  the  immediate  cause  of  death  as  sudden  death  with 
unknown  cause.  The  subject’s  relevant  medical  history  included  hypertension,  sleep  apnea,  obesity, 
and lower extremity pitting oedema. Concurrent medications were furosemide, potassium chloride, and 
ibuprofen (as required).

Neoplasm and cancer risk 
Across  controlled  short-term  (up  to  6 weeks)  studies,  AEs  that  coded  to  the  neoplasms  SOC  were 
reported  for  2  azilsartan  medoxomil–treated  subjects  (<0.1%),  neither  of  which  was  considered 
malignant.  Across  controlled  long-term  (up  to  24 weeks)  studies  in  1243  subjects,  including  co-
administration  studies,  AEs  that  coded  to  the  neoplasms  SOC  were  reported  for  11  azilsartan 
medoxomil–treated  subjects  (0.9%),  of  which,  events  were  identified  as  malignant  for  4  subjects 
(0.3%).  1  subjects  out  of  619  subjects  treated  with  a  comparator  coded  to  the  neoplasm  SOC  which 
was  not  considered  malignant.  In  the  Open-Label  Pool  (up  to  56  weeks),  9 subjects  (0.7%)  had  AEs 
that  coded  to  the  neoplasms  SOC,  of  which  for  4 subjects  (0.3%)  were  identified  as  malignant.  The 
interpretation  of  these  neoplasm  data  is  limited  by  relatively  short  exposure  duration  and  the  overall 
small number of events.  
Laboratory findings 
General findings 
In  the  short-term  placebo  controlled  studies  abnormal  lab  values  which  were  higher  than  0.1%  in 
every  treatment  group  were  creatinine  >  1.5×BL  and  >  ULN  (0.2%,  0.4%  and  0.3%  for  placebo, 
azilsartan  medoxomil  40  mg  and  80  mg  respectively),  AST  >  3×ULN  (0.7%,  0.7%  and  0.9%),  ALT 
>3×ULN  (0.2%,  0.6%  and  0.7%),  GGT  >  3×ULN  (2.3%,  1.7%  and  3.2%),  triglycerides  >  2.5×ULN 
(1.4%, 3.3% and 4.5%), uric acid increase (0.9%, 0.9% and 1.0%), and CK > 10×ULN (0.5%, 0.4% 
and 0.3%). 
The  most  frequently  observed  abnormal  lab  values  in  the  long-term  active  controlled  studies  were 
potassium  levels  >  6.0 mEq/L  (1.1%,  2.3%  and  2.0%  for  comparator,  azilsartan  medoxomil  40  mg 
and  80  mg  respectively),  GGT  >  3×ULN  (5.2%,  5.5%  and  5.4%),  triglycerides  >  2.5×ULN  (2.7%, 
2.8% and 2.6%), and uric acid increase (1.1%, 3.4% and 3.1%). 
Open-label pool 
Percentages of subjects with abnormal values of creatinine, GGT, triglycerides and uric acid at any visit 
were  7.7%,  6.3%,  7.6%,  and  11.9%  respectively.  In  these  studies,  subjects  were  allowed  to  add 
diuretics and other non-ARB antihypertensive agents, which likely contributed to the higher incidences 
of abnormal values of creatinine, triglycerides, and uric acid. For the majority of subjects, most of the 
abnormal  values  returned  to  baseline  or  had  stabilized  by  the  final  visit  or  at  subsequent  follow-up 
visits. Concurrent elevations of ALT and AST > 3×ULN occurred in 0.7% of subjects, and elevations of 
either  ALT  or  AST  >  5×ULN  occurred  in  0.2%  and  0.4%  of  subjects,  respectively.  No  subject  had  a 
value  >  10×ULN  or  had  a  concurrent  elevation  of  ALT  or  AST  with  total  bilirubin  >  2×ULN  or  ALP  > 
3×ULN. An in depth evaluation for these cases was provided. Two cases were related to study drug, of 
whom one patient was withdrawn from the study due to an hepatic adverse event.  
Twenty-four  (of  1257)  subjects  had  ALT  and/or  AST  >  3×ULN.  Eight  subjects  had  ALT  and  AST  > 
3×ULN,  and  for  3  of  these  8 subjects,  the  elevations  were  reported  as  AEs  (1 subject  prematurely 
discontinued).  AEs  associated  with  abnormal  chemistry  values  that  were  considered  to  be  SAEs  or 
resulted in premature discontinuation in the Open-Label Pool occurred in 19 subjects out of 1257. 
Serum creatinine elevation 
Serum  creatinine  elevations  were  observed  in  some  subjects,  especially  in  subjects  who  received 
azilsartan  medoxomil  co-administered  with  chlorthalidone  25 mg,  consistent  with  the  transient  and 
reversible profile of creatinine elevations known to occur with other RAAS blockers. In the short-term 
placebo-controlled studies >3 0% creatinine level elevation was observed in 4 (0.9%), 8 (1.2%), and 9

(1.3%)  patients  at  any  visit  treated  with  placebo,  azilsartan  medoxomil  40  and  80  mg,  respectively. 
This was 0.5%, 0,6% and 0.7% at the final visit. For long-term comparator studies these findings were 
4 (0.7%), 26 (4.2%) and 35 (5.8%) for any visit for comparator, azilsartan medoxomil 40 and 80 mg 
and  0,  0.6%  and  1.8%  at  the  final  visit.  When  azilsartan  medoxomil  was  co-administered  with  CLD 
these  rates  were  16.3%  versus  6.9%  in  the  monotherapy  arms  in  the  open-label  study  491-016  and 
26.9% vs 7.4% in the open-label study 491-006. These elevations were associated with greater blood 
pressure  reductions  in  the  long-term  active  controlled  studies,  which  is  also  consistent  with  the 
pharmacodynamic drug effects.  
The most convincing demonstration of the reversibility of creatinine elevations comes from study 016 
where study treatment was withdrawn in a randomised manner: twenty-one subjects with a creatinine 
elevation ≥ 30% entered the 6-week double-blind reversal phase of study 491-016 (7.9% (12/151) on 
placebo  and  6.2%  (9/146)  on  azilsartan  medoxomil).  During  this  phase  of  the  study,  (9.9%)  of  the 
subjects  who  remained  on  azilsartan  medoxomil  treatment  still  had  creatinine  elevation  ≥  30%.  For 
the  subjects  in  whom  azilsartan  medoxomil  was  withdrawn  creatinine  elevation  ≥30%  decreased  to 
2.7%.  
Immunological events 
A  small increase  in  the  number  of  patients  with  a decrease  in haemoglobin  was  found  comparable  to 
what  is  found  in  the  comparators  (5  (0.4%)  for  azilsartan  medoxomil,  3  (0.5%)  comparator).  In 
addition, a slightly higher incidence of decreased haematocrit was found for the study drug, although 
incidences were low (7 (1.2%) for azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg, 2 (0.3%) for azilsartan medoxomil 40 
mg, and 4 (0.7%) for comparator). 
Safety in special populations 
Renal impairment 
In phase 3 studies, across both (active and placebo) controlled-study pools, the moderate/severe renal 
impairment  subgroup  was  small  (5.6%  of  all  subjects).  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  higher  with 
azilsartan  medoxomil  80 mg  in  the  moderate  to  severe  subgroup  in  the  placebo-controlled  pool. 
However,  there  were  no  consistent  patterns  in  any  of  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  across  renal 
function  subgroups  with  azilsartan  medoxomil  treatment.  In  the  placebo-controlled  pool,  headache 
occurred  more  frequently  with  azilsartan  medoxomil  80 mg  in  the  moderate/severe  impairment 
subgroup (16.7% [5 of 30 subjects]) compared with the mild impairment (4.0% [13 of 326 subjects]) 
or normal renal function (5.5% [19 of 347 subjects]) subgroups. In contrast, in the long-term active-
controlled  pool,  headache  occurred  more  frequently  with  azilsartan  medoxomil  40  mg  in  the  normal 
subgroup  (10.2%  [21  of  206 subjects])  compared  with  the  mild  (6.2%  [23  of  370  subjects])  or 
moderate/severe  impairment  subgroups  (0  of  45  subjects).  Also  in  this  long-term  active-controlled 
pool,  azilsartan  medoxomil  treatment  in  the  moderate/severe  impairment  subgroup  was  associated 
with  a  higher  frequency  of  elevated  creatinine,  sodium,  potassium,  and  high  uric  acid  compared  with 
the  normal  and  mild  subgroups.  Azilsartan  medoxomil  exposure  was  only  modestly  elevated  in  mild 
(AUC +29%) and moderate (AUC +25%) renal impairment, but exposure was doubled (AUC +98%) in 
severe renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease should not 
be treated with azilsartan medoxomil as they were excluded from the clinical studies. This is reflected 
in the SmPC. 
Hepatic impairment 
Treatment  of  subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score  >9)  is  not  recommended 
according to the SmPC.

Age 
There  were  no  consistent  differences  between  the  <  65  and  ≥  65  years  subgroups  with  azilsartan 
medoxomil treatment in the overall incidence of AEs, SAEs, or AEs that led to study drug interruption 
or  premature  discontinuation.  Dizziness  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  ≥  65  years  subgroup  with 
placebo treatment. Cough occurred more frequently in the azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg group (3.1%) 
in  subjects  ≥65  years  compared  with  azilsartan  medoxomil  40  mg  group  (1.0%)  but  was  lower  than 
for  the  active  comparator  group  (4.1%)  in  the  long-term  active-controlled  pool.  Blood  CK  increased 
adverse events occurred more frequently with comparator and with azilsartan medoxomil treatment in 
the <65 years subgroup in the long-term active-controlled pool.  
Although  the  proportion  of  very  elderly  subjects  (≥  75 years)  in  both  phase  3  controlled  pools  was 
relatively small (4.3% in the monotherapy placebo-controlled pool and 5.1% in the long-term active-
controlled pool), their overall safety profile was similar to those < 75 years. Nevertheless, in the long-
term active-controlled pool, hypotension occurred more frequently in the ≥ 75 years subgroup than the 
<  75  years  subgroup  in  the  active  comparator  group  (12.9%  [4  subjects]  vs  3.7%)  but  not  in  the 
azilsartan medoxomil 40/80 mg group (6.2% [4 subjects] vs 7.9%); these AEs reported with azilsartan 
medoxomil  were not dose-dependent. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions have only been studied with regard to pharmacokinetics. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall,  few subjects  permanently  discontinued  study drug  due  to  adverse  events.  Overall,  dizziness, 
hypotension  and  headache  were  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  that  led  to  premature 
discontinuation. Occurrence of hypotension was more frequent in the longer term studies and appeared 
to be dose related for azilsartan medoxomil but not when co-administered with other antihypertensive 
agents as described below.  
Monotherapy placebo-controlled studies 
In  monotherapy  placebo-controlled  studies,  rates  for  discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  were  low 
(2.3% in study 008, 2.6% in study 491-019, and 1.7% in study 491-011) and similar between placebo 
and  azilsartan  medoxomil,  with  no  difference  between  the  40  and  80 mg  groups.  In  study  491-008, 
more  subjects  (11/283  (3.9%))  permanently  discontinued  the  study  due  to  adverse  events  in  the 
azilsartan  medoxomil  20 mg  group  compared  with  the  other  treatment  groups  (5/142  (3.5%)  for 
placebo,  3/283  (1.1%)  for  azilsartan  medoxomil  40 mg,  6/285  (2.1%)  for  azilsartan  medoxomil 
80 mg, and 4/282 (1.4%) for olmesartan medoxomil); none of the discontinuation events in the 20 mg 
group occurred in more than 1 subject except headache (2 subjects).  
Long-term active-controlled studies 
In  long-term  active-controlled  studies,  rates  for  discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  were  lower  in 
study  491-020  [ramipril  control]  (3.3%)  than  in  study  491-301  [valsartan  control]  (6.6%). 
Nonetheless, discontinuation rates in both studies were similar between active comparator (34(5.5%)) 
and  azilsartan  medoxomil  (66  (5.3%)),  with  no  difference  between  the  40  and  80 mg  groups  (30 
(4.8%) and 36 (5.8%)).

Open-label studies 
In open-label long-term studies, rates for discontinuation due to adverse events were generally low but 
slightly  higher  in  study  491-006  (7.3%),  a  56-week  study,  than  in  study  491-016  (6.5%)  and  study 
491-301 (4.7%), 26- and 28-week studies, respectively.  
Co-administration studies 
In  co-administration  studies,  rates  for  discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  were  generally  low  but 
more frequent with diuretic co-administration (4.4% in study 009 [chlorthalidone] and 7.7% in study 
491-306  [chlorthalidone  or  HCTZ])  than  with  amlodipine  co-administration  (1.2%  in  study  491-010). 
No differences were observed between the azilsartan medoxomil 40 and 80 mg groups in the 491-009 
and 491-010 studies. In study 306, the incidence was higher in subjects who received the FDC (9.2%) 
than in subjects who received azilsartan medoxomil co-administered with HCTZ (6.2%). 
Post marketing experience 
There is no post-marketing experience with this product (it is not yet marketed in any country). 
2.6.1  Discussion on clinical safety 
An adequate number of patients has been evaluated to establish azilsartan medoxomil’s safety profile. 
1704 patients have been treated for more than 26 weeks and 588 for more than 48 weeks. Although 
the ICH E1 Guideline “Population Exposure: The Extent of Population Exposure to Assess Clinical Safety 
(CMPM/ICH/375/95)”  stipulates  100  patients  should  be  treated  for  at  least  one  year,  this  slightly 
shorter period appears acceptable as the total number of patients exposed long-term is much larger.  
The  applicant  provided  data  on  adverse  events  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  against  placebo  and  against 
comparative ARBs. The adverse events of dizziness, fatigue, headache, blood creatinine increased AEs, 
hypotension, postural dizziness, and blood CK increased AEs were consistently found during study drug 
(azilsartan  medoxomil)  treatment  across  the  different  controlled  and  open-label  trials.  Diarrhoea, 
dizziness, hypotension and fatigue appear to be dose-related and occur most often in the highest dose 
group (80 mg azilsartan medoxomil). In particular, the higher incidence of dizziness and hypotension 
can  be  explained  by  the  stronger  antihypertensive  effect  observed  with  the  highest  azilsartan 
medoxomil dose. Data on the incidence of hypotension and dizziness over time indicate a dose-related 
higher  incidence  with  azilsartan  medoxomil  already  occurring  within  a  few  weeks  for  both  of  these 
adverse events. These adverse events also demonstrated to lead to more treatment discontinuations, 
although this was only slightly more compared to placebo. 
A  detailed  description  of  renal  adverse  events  showed  that  incidences  were  low  and  not  much  higher 
than for placebo. However, in the long-term trials there appeared to be a dose-dependent relation for 
blood  creatinine  increase  (or  GFR  decrease)  and  blood  urea  increase.  Increase  in  the  level  of  serum 
creatinine is known to be associated with RAAS blockade, and represents most of the time a reversible 
hemodynamic  effect  associated  with  a  higher  blood  pressure  reduction.  In  addition,  reversibility  has 
been shown from data of the reversible phase of study 491-016.  
In general the incidence of laboratory abnormalities was low. Hyperkalemia did occur. It is known to be 
associated with RAAS blockade and is also observed with other ARBs and ACE-inhibitors. In contrast to 
other ARBs an increase in uric acid increase was observed, in particular in the longer term. This could 
be  partly  explained  by  reduced  GFR,  however,  this  should  be  further  followed  post-approval. 
Furthermore, some abnormalities in liver enzymes (ALT, AST and triglycerides) were noticed, but this 
was not consistent across all trials and was also observed for the comparators (valsartan and ramipril). 
Specific  cases  have  been  described  in  detail.  A  small  increase  in  the  number  of  patients  with  a 
Edarbi

decrease  in  haemoglobin  was  found  comparable  to  what  is  found  in  the  comparators.  In  addition,  a 
higher incidence of decreased haematocrit was found for the study drug, although incidences are low. 
The incidence of serious adverse events was generally low and not significantly different compared to 
the comparators (ARB, ACE, placebo). There seems not to be any relation between study drug and the 
four deaths that occurred, although in one case of sudden death the information was limited. 
Several  subgroup  analyses  were  performed.  Based  on  the  data  provided  no  trend  towards  a  higher 
incidence of neoplasm or cancer could be observed, but the incidence was very low and no conclusions 
can  be  drawn.  A  recent  meta-analysis  identified  no  increased  risk  with  ARBs  in  contrast  to  previous 
publications. 
The  use  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  according  to  renal  impairment  showed  no  clear  trend  towards  more 
adverse  events,  discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  or  severe  adverse  events  with  increasing 
impairment  of  renal  function.  No  consistent  pattern  in  terms  of  more  adverse  events  in  severe  renal 
impairment on the highest azilsartan medoxomil dose is observed. However, laboratory adverse events 
related to blockade of the RAAS (creatinine, potassium, sodium, etc.) were increased during long-term 
treatment in moderate and severe renal impaired patients. Exposure to azilsartan medoxomil may be 
doubled  in  these  patients  (see  pharmacokinetic  section).  This  warrants  more  careful  up-titration  in 
patients with moderate to severe impairment as has been reflected in the SmPC. 
Severe hepatic impaired patients were not included in the studies. This is covered in the SmPC.  
In  addition,  typical  adverse  events  associated  in  the  elderly  are  found  such  as  hypotension  and 
dizziness.  However,  this  was  not  seen  to  be  different  for  azilsartan  medoxomil  than  for  the 
comparators. However, numbers of very elderly were limited. This also applies to the patients with co 
morbidities  and  at  high  CV  risk  (see  also  above  under  efficacy).  Therefore,  the  safety  profile  of 
azilsartan medoxomil in these patients is not clearly established.  
2.6.2  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In general, adverse events associated with azilsartan medoxomil were mild to moderate of origin and 
not different from what is known from other ARBs. The adverse events of dizziness, fatigue, increase in 
blood  creatinine,  hypotension,  dizziness  postural,  and  blood  CK  increased  were  consistently  found 
during  study  drug  treatment  across  the  different  controlled  and  open-label  trials.  Most  appear  to  be 
dose-related  and  occurred  most  often  in  the  highest  dose  group  (80  mg  azilsartan  medoxomil).  A 
dose-dependent  increase  in  blood  creatinine  was  observed  that  is  known  to  be  associated  with  RAAS 
blockade and represents most of the time a reversible hemodynamic effect associated with more blood 
pressure  reduction.  Similarly,  hyperkalaemia  did  occur,  as  also  observed  with  other  ARBs  and  ACE-
inhibitors.  An  unexpected  increase  in  uric  acid  was  observed,  which  could  partly  be  related  to  a 
reduced GFR, but further follow-up is warranted. 
Only limited information was  available  in  high  risk  groups,  such  as  the very  elderly  and  patients  who 
have  an  activated  RAAS  such  as  patients  with  heart  failure.  Renal  impaired  patients  did  not 
demonstrate  a  higher  safety  risk  profile,  although  exposure  is  increased  in  severe  renal  impairment 
which  warrants  more  careful  titration.  Patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  should  not  be  treated 
with azilsartan medoxomil as reflected in the SmPC.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Azilsartan medoxomil is a selective AT1 receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for the treatment of essential 
hypertension.  Significant  blood  pressure  reduction  versus  placebo  in  the  short-term  trials  of  6  weeks 
was  demonstrated  for  the  whole  range  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  formulations  of  20mg,  40mg  and  80 
mg  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  uncomplicated  essential  hypertension  (-12.2  mmHg  to  -14.6 
mmHg  24h  SBP).  The  40  mg  and  the  80  mg  azilsartan  medoxomil  doses  were  superior  to  (maximal 
dose)  valsartan  320mg  (-10.2  mmHg,  p<0.001)  and  the  80  mg  dose  was  superior  compared  to  a 
maximal  dose  of  olmesartan  (-11.7  mmHg  versus  -12.6  mmHg  24h  SBP,  p=0.038)  on  ABPM,  clinical 
SBP  and  responder  rates  (56.6-57.8%  AZI  80  vs  48.7-53.2%  OLM,  p=0.035).  A  more  severe

hypertensive  patients  group  was  included  in  the  open-label  phase  conform  with  the  inclusion  criteria 
and sufficient numbers of patients were analyzed to assess antihypertensive efficacy. 
Consistent efficacy was found across subgroups, including patients with renal insufficiency, except for 
the  age  group  of  >  75  years  of  age  and  in  the  black  population  versus  placebo.  A  lower,  but  still 
significant response for the black subjects was also demonstrated in the clinical study including only a 
black  population.  This  is  known  from  other  ARBs  and  ACE-inhibitors  and  possibly  due  to  the  higher 
prevalence of low-renin states in black hypertensive patients. 
For  the  long-term  (24  weeks)  comparative  studies,  significant more  systolic  blood  pressure  reduction 
was demonstrated for both doses of azilsartan medoxomil 40 and 80 mg compared to valsartan (24h 
SBP –14.9, -15.3 and -11.3 mmHg, resp. (p<0.001 vs. valsartan) and ramipril (clinical SBP for 40 mg, 
80 mg dose and ramipril is -20.6, -21.4 and -12.2 mmHg, resp. (p<0.001 vs. ramipril)). Reduction in 
diastolic  blood  pressure  and  responder  rates  were  consistent  with  these  results.  Consistent  findings 
were observed for the blood pressure lowering across subgroups.  
In  the  co-administration  studies,  both  the  40  mg  and  80  mg  azilsartan  medoxomil  demonstrated 
additional  efficacy  when  combined  with  amlodipine  and  chlorthalidone  (-24.8,  -24.5  vs  -13.6  (AML) 
and -31.7, -31.3 vs -15.9 (CLD) mmHg 24h SBP, respectively).  
The  long-term  open-label  studies  demonstrated  that  azilsartan  medoxomil  efficacy  was  maintained 
during the entire study period. Addition of CLD, amlodipine or HCT resulted in additional blood pressure 
lowering in these studies. Maintenance of efficacy was further demonstrated with the reversal phase in 
study  491-016  where  treatment  continuation  was  associated  with  significant  larger  blood  pressure 
reduction  compared  to  patients  assigned  to  placebo.  In  addition,  a  post-hoc  analysis  demonstrated 
additional efficacy of the 80 mg dose in non-responders to 40 mg of approximately 5 mmHg SBP. 
Patients  with  pre-existent  cardiovascular  events/co-morbidities  (n=378)  were  allowed  in  the  studies, 
and showed similar antihypertensive efficacy to the overall population. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Twenty-four  hour  blood  pressure  lowering  efficacy  maintenance  (trough-to-peak  ratio)  was  not 
different  for  azilsartan  medoxomil  compared  to  olmesartan  (0.952  and  0.771  for  80  mg  azilsartan 
medoxomil and 0.915 and 0.892 for olmesartan 20 mg during 24h in 2 studies) and this stronger effect 
of  azilsartan  medoxomil  does  not  appear  related  to  its  PK  properties,  but  possibly  to  a  slower 
dissociation of the AT1 receptor (see also non-clinical section).  
Only limited data were obtained in more complex patients, i.e. patients with co-morbidity such as heart 
failure and diabetes mellitus, and the very elderly. Less efficacy in the > 75 years of age subgroup was 
demonstrated  for  azilsartan  medoxomil  versus  comparator  and  placebo  in  the  short  and  long-term 
studies with wide confidence interval due to limited number of patients. High risk patients (according 
to ESC (clinical SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, clinical SBP > 160 mm Hg and DBP < 70 mm 
Hg,  metabolic  syndrome,  ≥  3  CV  high  risk  factors,  subclinical  organ  damage,  CV/renal  disease,  or 
diabetes ) and SCORE classification (≥ 5% risk of CV death within a 10-year period)) showed similar 
efficacy as to the overall population. 
Beneficial  effects  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  on  mortality  and  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  target  organ 
damage are currently unknown.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
An adequate number of patients treated with azilsartan medoxomil have been evaluated compared to 
placebo  and  active  comparators.  Furthermore  sufficient  numbers  of  patients  have  been  included  to 
evaluate long-term safety: 1704 for more than 26 weeks and 588 for more than 48 weeks. 
The adverse events of dizziness, fatigue, headache, blood creatinine increased, hypotension, dizziness 
postural,  and  blood  CK  increased  were  consistently  found  during  study  drug  treatment  across  the 
different controlled and open-label trials. 
Adverse events of diarrhoea, dizziness, hypotension and fatigue are well known from other ARBs and 
appear  to  be  dose-related  as  they  occur  most  often  in  the  highest  dose  group.  In  the  placebo 
controlled studies incidences of these side effects were 0, 0.7 and 1.3% for placebo; 0.9, 1.9 and 2.3% 
for azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg; and 0.2, 0.4 and 1.1% for azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg, respectively. 
They  may  occur  within  a  few  weeks  and  are  generally  mild  in  nature.  Only  slightly  more  patients 
discontinued  on  azilsartan  medoxomil  than  on  placebo  and  generally,  treatment  was  tolerated  well. 
The incidence of serious adverse events was generally low.  
A  detailed  description  of  renal  adverse  events  showed  that  incidences  were  low  and  not  much  higher 
than for placebo. A dose-dependent relation for blood creatinine increase (or GFR decrease) may occur 
that was most pronounced in the long term studies: 1.1%, 3.4% and 3.1% for comparator, azilsartan 
medoxomil 40 and azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg. Increase in the level of serum creatinine is known to 
be  associated  with  RAAS  blockade  and  has  been  observed  with  other  ARBs.  The  use  of  azilsartan 
medoxomil  according  to  renal  impairment  showed  no  clear  trend  towards  more  adverse  events, 
discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  or  severe  adverse  events  with  increasing  impairment  of  renal 
function.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  number  of  patients  treated  for  more  than  52  weeks  is  unknown,  although  approximately  588 
patients were treated for 48 weeks or more.  
In  contrast  to  other  ARBs  an  increase  in  uric  acid  increase  was  observed,  in  particular  in  the  longer 
term.  This  could  partly  be  explained  by  a  reduction  in  GFR  that  fits  with  the  potent  AT1  antagonist 
effect. The increase in uric acid levels was not combined with an increased number of related adverse 
events such as gout and nephrolithiasis.  
Some  abnormalities  in  liver  enzymes  (ALT,  AST  and  triglycerides)  were  noticed,  but  were  not 
consistent  for  all  trials  and  were  of  a similar level as  for  the  comparators  (valsartan,  ramipril).  Some 
detailed description has been provided. 
There seems not to be a relation between study drug and the death cases that occurred, however, for 
one case this was uncertain, in particular because of lack of information.  
Based on the data provided here, no trend towards a higher incidence of neoplasm or cancer could be 
observed,  but  incidences  were  very  low  and  no  conclusions  can  be  drawn.  A  recent  meta-analysis 
identified no increased risk with ARBs in contrast to previous publications.

Laboratory adverse events related to blockade of the RAAS (creatinine, potassium, sodium, etc.) were 
increased  during  long-term  treatment  in  these  moderate  and  severe  renal  impaired  patients. 
Conclusions  regarding  dose  recommendation  for  the  renally  impaired  patients  cannot  be  made  based 
on  these  results.  Exposure  to  azilsartan  medoxomil  may  be  doubled  in  these  patients  (see 
pharmacokinetic  section).  More  careful  up-titration  in  patients  with  severe  impairment  has  been 
recommended in the SmPC.  
Clinical  experience  treating  patients  with  any  type  of  hepatic  impairment  is  extremely  limited.  The 
applicant conducted one hepatic impairment study, which included 8 patients with mild and 8 patients 
with  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  In  these  patients  a  slight  increase  (1.3  to  1.5  fold)  in  azilsartan 
medoxomil  exposure  was  observed  but  still  adverse  event  patterns  could  be  different  due  to  an 
increased  pharmacodynamic  response.  Severe  hepatic  impaired  patients  were  not  included  in  the 
studies.  Therefore  caution  is  needed  and  a  starting  dose  of  20  mg  azilsartan  medoxomil  could  be 
considered  in  subjects  with  mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  The  use  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  
cannot be recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment as reflected in the SmPC.  
Although numbers of elderly were limited, typical adverse events associated with the more elderly are 
found such as hypotension and dizziness. However, these were similar between azilsartan medoxomil 
and comparator. Numbers of very elderly, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure or activated RAAS were 
more  limited.  Therefore,  the  safety  profile  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  in  these  patients  is  not  clearly 
established. The external validity for such patients is limited.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Antihypertensive treatment is indicated to reduce the risk for cardiovascular events. Reduction of blood 
pressure is directly associated with reduction of CV events. The choice of 24 hour ABPM systolic blood 
pressure  as  primary  endpoint  is  considered  appropriate.  It  provides  an  appropriate  insight  into  blood 
pressure  changes  during  everyday  activities  and  is  strongly  recommended  for  the  evaluation  of  new 
antihypertensive  agents.  In  addition,  the  choice  of  clinical  SBP  at  trough  as  the  major  secondary 
endpoint  is  important  as  the  best  evidence  for  association  between  blood  pressure  reduction  and 
reduction of CV risk still comes from SBP.  
Azilsartan medoxomil is a new ARB, belonging to a group of antihypertensives that has an established 
place  in  the  treatment  of  hypertension.  Its  antihypertensive  effects  as  demonstrated  in  the 
development  programme  are  considered  clinically  relevant  and  at  least  comparable  to  other 
antihypertensive agents. 
Beneficial  effects  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  on  mortality  and  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  target  organ 
damage are currently unknown. 
The observed AE include mainly diarrhoea, hypotension, dizziness and fatigue and these are generally 
well  tolerated.  Laboratory  abnormalities  may  occur,  in  particular  increases  in  creatinine  and  serum 
potassium. This is similar to other ARBs and manageable in the tested population. Unexpected uric acid 
increase was observed which could be partly related to a reduced GFR.  
Clinical experience in very elderly patients ( > 75  years), patients with renal and hepatic impairment 
and  high  CV  risk  (heart  failure,  DM)  is  limited.  Uncertainties  still  remain  on  the  safety  profile  of 
azilsartan medoxomil and the dosing recommendations for these patients.

CHMP assessment report

Benefit-risk balance 
The  balance  between  favourable  and  unfavourable  effects  of  azilsartan  medoxomil  is  considered 
positive.  Its  antihypertensive  efficacy  has  been  established  in  patients  with  uncomplicated  mild  to 
severe  essential  hypertension  in  dosages  ranging  from  20-80  mg.  The  40  mg  dose  is  considered  an 
acceptable  starting  dose  in  these  patients.  The  AE  observed  with  azilsartan  medoxomil  are  similar  to 
those observed with other ARBs and appear to be dose-related. AEs may occur within a few weeks and 
are generally mild in nature.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The overall benefit/risk of azilsartan medoxomil is considered positive for the indication: “Treatment of 
essential hypertension in adults”.

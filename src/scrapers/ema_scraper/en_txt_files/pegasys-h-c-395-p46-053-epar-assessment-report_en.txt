1.  Introduction 
On 07 July 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a, 
PEG-IFN), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH is planning to submit a Type II variation with a new indication to update the SmPC with data 
from the YV25718 study. The variation will be submitted in November 2016 dependent upon the timing 
of a positive PIP compliance check, currently anticipated in October 2016.  
CHMP comment 
This report does not present a final assessment of the submitted study results. The submitted clinical 
study report will be assessed as part of the upcoming new indication variation. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that YV25718 is a stand-alone study. 
The YV25718 study is part of the approved Pegasys Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-000298-
PIP01-08-M05) for the treatment of Hepatitis B. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
PEG-IFN (180 μg/mL) was supplied as 2-mL glass vials containing an injectable solution (benzyl 
alcohol, sodium chloride, sodium acetate trihydrate, acetic acid [glacial], polysorbate 80, and water for 
injection). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
YV25718 - A Phase IIIb Parallel Group, Open Label Study of Pegylated Interferon alfa-2a 
Monotherapy (PEG-IFN, Ro 25-8310) Compared to Untreated Control in Children with HBeAg 
Positive Chronic Hepatitis B in the Immune Active Phase. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study YV25718 
Study YV25718 was a 2:1 randomized, controlled, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter study of 
PEG-IFN treatment in patients aged 3 to ≤17 years, compared with an untreated control.  Patients 
without advanced fibrosis were randomized 2:1 to PEG-IFN treatment (Group A) or untreated control 
(Group B), respectively.  Patients with advanced fibrosis were assigned to PEG-IFN treatment (Group

C). Patients were dosed using a body surface area (BSA)-category based dosing regimen. This regimen 
was based on the one approved in Europe for the treatment of pediatric patients with CHC. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
As the MAH intends to submit a type II variation based on the YV25718 clinical study report, the full 
review and assessment of the submitted study will be conducted as part of the upcoming new 
indication variation. There are no safety signals that require regulatory action before the anticipated 
type II variation. 
This assessment report concludes the current procedure. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
No further action required 
This study will be fully reviewed in the future new indication variation. 
  Not fulfilled: 
Additional clarifications requested 
Not applicable.

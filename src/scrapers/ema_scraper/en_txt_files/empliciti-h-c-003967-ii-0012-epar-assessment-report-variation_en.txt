Empliciti (elotuzumab), is an antibody that specifically targets the SLAMF7 (signaling lymphocyte activation 
molecule  family  member  7)  protein,  currently  approved  in  EU  “in  combination  with  lenalidomide  and 
dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior 
therapy”. 
Within  this  type  II  variation  procedure  an  extension  of  indication  for  elotuzumab  is  requested,  “in 
combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma 
who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy”.  
The proposed elotuzumab dose regimen is 10 mg/kg every week for the first 2 cycles and 20 mg/kg Q4W 
thereafter  which  is  slightly  different  from  the  already  approved  dose  regimen  in  combination  with 
lenalidomide (i.e., 10 mg/kg every week for the first 2 cycles and 10 mg/kg Q2W thereafter).

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
The elotuzumab clinical pharmacology profile, including single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK), 
pharmacodynamics  (PD),  pharmacogenomics,  drug-drug  interaction  potential,  and  exposure-response 
(E-R) relationships with safety and efficacy in MM have been previously submitted and were assessed in the 
initial Marketing Authorisation procedure EMEA/H/C/003967/0000.  
The current approved dosage of elotuzumab is 10 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) every week (QW) 
for  the  first  two  cycles  (28-day  cycles)  and  every  2  weeks  (Q2W)  thereafter  in  conjunction  with  the 
recommended dosing of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone.  
The  basis  of  this  submission  is  a  Phase  2  study,  CA204125,  which  evaluated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
elotuzumab  in  combination  with  pomalidomide/dexamethasone  versus  pomalidomide/dexamethasone  in 
subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).  
Study  CA204125,  evaluated  a  new  combination  treatment  of  elotuzumab  with  pomalidomide  and 
dexamethasone. Additionally, a new dosing regimen of elotuzumab was proposed and investigated in this 
study. In the first two cycles, elotuzumab was again administered as 10 mg/kg intravenously QW, but from 
the 3rd cycle, elotuzumab was administered as 20 mg/kg IV (Day 1) of each cycle, i.e. every 4 weeks.   
A population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis has been conducted to compare the exposure of elotuzumab 
with the new dose regimen for this new combination treatment and the currently approved dose regimen.  
Bioanalytical methods 
The  concentration  of  elotuzumab  in  human  plasma  was  determined  using  a  quantitative  enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (TLIAM-0180) and validated at Tandem Labs West Trenton, NJ under study 
TNJR10-217.  However,  due  to  closure  of  the  lab,  the  method  was  transferred  to  Syngene  International 
Limited  (Bangalore  India)  as  method  BAL-II/MOA/019  and  validated  under  study  U-16054.  A 
cross-validation was performed between these two methods using QCs and pooled incurred samples which 
met the cross-validation criteria.

failed due to processing error. 
However, the assessment was not repeated 
as 120 hours stability is sufficient to support 
the study. 
Long-term stability (-60°C to -80°C) 
Stable  up  to  295  days  in  normal  pooled

Analysis study samples of study CA204125 
A total of 933 samples were analysed in 79 bioanalytical runs. 9 runs failed to meet the acceptance criteria 
during the conduct of the study. These batches were rejected as Standard curves in these batches did not 
meet the defined acceptance criteria. An “Out of specification” occurred during the conduct of the due to 
consecutive  failure  of  4  sample  analysis  batches.  Incurred  sample  reanalysis  was  performed  using  99 
samples from different subjects analysed by various analysts in different runs. 88% of the samples met the 
predefined acceptance criteria.

Detection of anti-drug antibodies in human serum 
The  ADA  samples  from  studies  CA204004,  CA204005,  CA204007  and  CA204011  were  analysed  using  a 
qualitative, bridging ECL immunoassay (TLIAM-0183), which detects all antibody isotypes (IgG, IgM, IgE, 
IgA) that was validated at Tandem Labs West Trenton, NJ under study TNJR10-219. However, due to closure 
of the lab supporting TLIAM-0183, the method was transferred to Syngene International Limited (Bangalore 
India) as method BAL-II/MOA/035 and validated under study U-16172. The method BAL-II/MOA/035 was 
then used to continue analysing samples from CA204125. Confirmed positive samples were analysed for 
presence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) by a validated functional cell based bioassay (MTHD15936.2). 
This functional cell based bioassay was then transferred to Syngene International Limited (Bangalore India) 
as method BAL-II/MOA/059 and validated under study U-16337. All methods are summarized in the table 
below.  
Table 2 Bioanalytical Methods for Detection of Anti-Elotuzumab 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
A  PPK  model  was  submitted  to  support  the  new  dosing  regimen.  The  model  aimed  to  characterise  the 
pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab in MM subjects and to determine the effect of key intrinsic and extrinsic 
covariates  on  elotuzumab  PK  parameters  and  exposure.  Also,  the  model  was  used  to  estimate 
pharmacokinetic parameters from patients included in study CA204125.  
This model was based on 8180 elotuzumab serum concentration values from  440 subjects with multiple 
myeloma (MM), who were enrolled in 5 clinical studies (Phase 3 study CA204004, Phase 1 study CA204005, 
Phase 1b study CA204007, Phase 2 study CA204011, and Phase 2 study CA204125). In short,

•  Study  CA204004  was  the  pivotal  Phase  3  study  in  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  multiple 
myeloma with or without elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone. 
•  Study CA204005 was a Phase 1 study in Japanese  patients with relapsed or refractory receiving 
elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone. 
•  Study CA204007 was a Phase 1b study in patients with relapsed or refractory receiving elotuzumab 
in  combination  with  lenalidomide/dexamethasone  with  normal  renal  function,  severe  renal 
impairment, or end stage renal disease requiring dialysis. 
•  Study CA204011 was a Phase 2 supportive biomarker study in patients with high-risk smoldering 
myeloma receiving elotuzumab monotherapy. 
•  Study  CA204125  was  a  Phase  2  study  in  patients  with  RRMM  with  or  without  elotuzumab  in 
combination with pomalidomide/dexamethasone. 
The PK of elotuzumab was described by a full model approach, based on the previously developed population 
pharmacokinetics  (PPK)  model  used  to  describe  the  PK  of  elotuzumab  alone  and  in  combination  with 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone. The full model for this updated PPK model accounted for additional effect of 
concomitant  pomalidomide/dexamethasone  or 
lenalidomide/coadministration  administration  on 
non-specific clearance (CL) and the target-mediated elimination from the peripheral compartment (Kint). 
Additionally,  the  covariate  effect  of  baseline  M-protein  in  the  prior  model  was  replaced  by  time-varying 
M-protein.  The  structural  model  for  elotuzumab  PK  was  a  two  compartment  model  with  zero  order  IV 
infusion,  parallel  linear  and  Michaelis-Menten  elimination  from  the  central  compartment,  and  additional 
target-mediated  elimination  from  the  peripheral  compartment  (Kint).  The  model  was  parameterized  in 
terms of the following PK parameters: clearance (CL), volume of distribution of the central compartment 
(VC), intercompartmental clearance (Q),  volume of  distribution of the peripheral compartment (VP), the 
maximum  rate  of  Michaelis-Menten  elimination  (VMAX),  Michaelis-Menten  constant  (KM),  initial  target 
concentration in the peripheral compartment (RMAX), and second-order elimination rate constant of the 
drug-target  complex  from  the  peripheral  compartment  (Kint).  The  full  model  included  the  following 
parameter-covariate relationships: 
•  CL  ~  baseline  body  weight  and  monotherapy  or  with  pomalidomide/dexamethasone  (relative  to 
elotuzumab + lenalidomide/dexamethasone 
•  VC  ~  baseline  body  weight,  sex,  race  (Asian  versus  all  other  races),  and  baseline  beta-2 
microglobulin (B2MICG); 
•  VMAX ~ serum M-protein (time-dependent); 
•  Kint ~ pomalidomide/dexamethasone (relative to elotuzumab + lenalidomide/dexamethasone; and 
•  VP and Q ~ baseline body weight 
Model evaluation was performed for the full model using a visual predictive check, in which the median, 5th 
and  95th  percentiles  of  the  observed  concentration-time  data  of  subjects  in  each  group  with  the  90% 
prediction  interval  of  the  corresponding  statistics  of  simulated  values  (n  =  1000  simulations)  were 
compared.  Visual  predictive  checks  were  performed  with  subjects  grouped  by  study  and  dose  level  and 
stratified  by  influential  covariates.  Furthermore,  the  estimates  of  precision  for  the  model  parameters 
(asymptotic standard errors and/or nonparametric bootstrap 95% confidence intervals [CI]) were provided 
for each of the parameters (n = 500 bootstraps). Stratification by study during the random sampling process

was implemented. The PPK analysis was performed using the NONMEM computer program (Version 7.3, 
ICON Development Solutions, Hanover, MD), compiled using gcc 4.4.7 or later, and graphics were prepared 
using the R software (Version 3.1.1 or later).  
Study results – CA204125 
The PPK model was used to estimate PK parameters for study CA204125. The final PPK model was used to 
obtain summary measures of exposure, which were compared by dosing regimen.

Elotuzumab 10 mg/kg QW Administration for cycle 1 and 2, followed by 10 mg/kg 
Q2W (E-Ld) or 20 mg/kg Q4W (E-Pd) for subsequent cycles 
The model was also used to simulate concentrations over time using the dose regimens of interest (E-Pd: 10 
mg/kg QW for two 28-day cycles followed by 20 mg/kg Q4W administration, E-Ld: 10 mg/kg QW for two 
28-day cycles followed by 10 mg/kg Q2W administration).

10 mg/kg QW Administration for cycle 1 and 2. Followed by 10 mg/kg Q2W (E-Ld) or 
20 mg/kg Q4W (E-PD) for subsequent cycles
Geometric  mean  CminSS  and  CmaxSS  achieved  by  20  mg/kg  Q4W  were  31%  lower  and  38%  higher, 
respectively, in subjects coadministered pomalidomide/dexamethasone compared with 10 mg/kg Q2W in 
subjects coadministered lenalidomide/dexamethasone. However, CavgSS was predicted to be very similar 
between 10 mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W dose regimens. 
To compute the effective half-life and accumulation ratio, elotuzumab concentration-time curve was 
simulated for a typical subject by concomitant medication for the 10 mg/kg QW dosing regimen.

For subjects with pomalidomide/dexamethasone coadministration, accumulation ratio based on AUC was 
estimated to be 8.15 with the corresponding effective half-life of 37.1 days. For 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone coadministration, the corresponding values were 6.95 and 31.2 days, 
respectively (Table 4).

Immunogenicity results of study CA104125  
Immunogenicity was explored in the PPK analysis. A total of 102 subjects (23.2% of subjects in the analysis) 
had at least one positive ADA value, defined as positive TITER value including baseline.  
Figure 2 Start and Duration of Immunogenicity in Subjects Coadministered 
Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone or Pomalidomide/Dexamethasone 
Among 409 subjects coadministered lenalidomide/dexamethasone or pomalidomide/ dexamethasone, 87 
(23.2%) had observed ADAs. Model-based simulations of elotuzumab exposure showed lower exposure in 
subjects  with  ADAs.  For  these  subjects,  Cavg1  and  CavgSS  were,  respectively,  29%  and  33%  lower 
respectively  than  the  corresponding  values  for  subjects  without  ADAs.  Note  that  the  largest  difference 
(42%) was observed for the minimum concentration after the first dose (Cmin1), before an ADA mediated 
increase in elotuzumab elimination to take effect could occur.

Absorption 
Elotuzumab is administered via intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely bioavailable. 
Distribution 
The  geometric  mean  volume  of  distribution  of  elotuzumab  at  the  recommended  dosing  regimen  in 
combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone or pomalidomide/dexamethasone at steady state is 5.7 L 
(CV: 23%) and 5.6 L (CV: 21%) respectively. 
Elimination 
The  geometric  mean  total  clearance  of  elotuzumab  at  10  mg/kg  (in  combination  with  lenalidomide  and 
dexamethasone) at steady state is 0.194 L/day (CV: 62.9%). 
Upon discontinuation of elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or in combination 
with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, concentrations of elotuzumab will decrease to approximately 3% 
(approximately  97% washout  as  estimated  by  5 half-lives)  of  the  population  predicted  steady-state 
maximal serum concentration by 3 months.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Nonlinearity  of  elotuzumab  PK  was  examined  previously  by  testing  models  with  parallel  linear  and 
target-mediated  elimination.  The  kinetics  of  elotuzumab  was  nonlinear.  In  addition  to  nonspecific  linear 
clearance,  the  model  included  Michaelis-Menten  elimination  term  from  the  central  compartment  and 
additional  target-mediated  elimination  from  the  peripheral  compartment.  These  results  indicate  that 
exposure to elotuzumab increases greater than dose-proportionally (see  Figure below). Total steady-state 
clearance was computed from the full model as a sum of nonspecific linear clearance and target mediated 
clearance: 
Additional target mediated elimination from the peripheral compartment was not considered in computation 
of  the  total  steady  state  clearance  since  the  target  was  considered  to  be  non-renewable  resulting  in 
depletion over time from the peripheral compartment and therefore, steady state clearance was driven by 
elimination of elotuzumab only from the central compartment.

Time dependencies 
The full PPK model included elotuzumab elimination from the peripheral compartment facilitated by binding 
to the hypothetical target pool. The amount of the target in the peripheral compartment was not assumed to 
be renewable, resulting in decrease of target-mediated elimination from the peripheral compartment over 
time,  as  illustrated  in  the  figure  below.    The  median  time  to  20  fold  target  depletion  for  subjects 
coadministered pomalidomide/dexamethasone was 22 weeks (95% prediction interval 6 to 76.9 weeks).

To  compute  the  effective  half-life  and  accumulation  ratio,  elotuzumab  concentration-time  curve  was 
simulated for a typical subject by concomitant medication for 10 mg/kg QW dose regimen. 
For subjects with pomalidomide/dexamethasone coadministration, accumulation ratio based on AUC was 
estimated 
to  be  8.15  with 
the 
corresponding  effective  half-life  of  37.1  days.  For 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone  coadministration,  the  corresponding  values  were  6.95  and  31.2  days, 
respectively (see table below).

Special populations 
In  the  PPK  analysis  several  covariates  were  tested  and  the  parameter-covariate  relationships  were 
adequately accounted for in the model development. Only body size was found to be significant on CL and 
VC.  The  proposed  weight-based  dosing,  from  the  simulation  provided  in  the  PPK  analysis,  generated  a 
uniform exposure justifying the choice of the weight-adjusted.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal PK DDI studies have been conducted with elotuzumab.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The current approved dosage of elotuzumab is 10 mg/kg administered IV every week (QW) for the first two 
cycles (28-day cycles) and every 2 weeks (Q2W) thereafter in conjunction with the recommended dosing of 
lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone. In this variation, the applicant applied for a new combination of 
elotuzumab  with  pomalidomide/dexamethasone.  Also,  a  new  posology  from  the  3rd  cycle  has  been 
proposed: 20 mg/kg administered IV every 4 weeks. In order to describe the PK profile with the new dose 
regimen two PK samples (Cycle 3 and 7 after infusion respectively) have been taken in study CA204125.  
Bioanalytical  method:  The  concentration  of  elotuzumab  in  human  plasma  was  determined  using  a 
quantitative  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  and  validated  at  a  new  location  (Syngene 
International  Limited).  The  bioanalytical  method  was  validated  for  intra-  and  inter-assay  accuracy  and 
precision, selectivity, stability and dilutional linearity. The cross-validation experiments met the pre-defined 
acceptance criteria. 
For the qualitative detection of anti-elotuzumab antibodies in human serum an electrochemiluminescence 
(ECL) assay utilizing seramag magnetic microparticles and heat dissociation was used. This method was fully 
validated. Anti-elotuzumab antibodies in human serum can be detected at 250 ng/mL in the presence of 800 
μg/mL of Elotuzumab drug. 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analysis:  A  PPK  analysis  was  conducted  to  estimate  pharmacokinetic 
parameters  of  study  CA204125  and  to  compare  with  elotuzumab  exposures  for  the  approved  dosing 
regimen. The PPK model was developed using a previously conducted PPK model as basis. The mechanistic 
plausibility  of  this  model  is  questionable,  because  the  model  includes  both  linear  and  non-linear 
(Michaelis-Menten)  elimination  from  the  central  compartment,  and  an  additional  target-mediated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/534722/2019

elimination  from  the  peripheral  compartment.  Only  study  CA204007  included  multiple  samples  in  the 
elimination phase of elotuzumab. Nonetheless, the model appears to accurately estimate the individual PK 
parameters.  
Comparison exposure of elotuzumab between Q2W and Q4W: The average plasma-concentration 
appears to be similar for the two dosing regimens (Q2W versus Q4W). However, Cmin and Cmax at steady 
state were respectively 31% lower and 38% higher. Potentially, this implies that more patients are not 
sufficiently exposed to elotuzumab to cover the entire 28 day cycle in the Q4W dosing regimen. Also, a 
higher Cmax could cause more adverse events.  
The simulated elotuzumab average steady state exposures with this Q4W dosing regimen were very similar 
to those with the 10 mg/kg Q2W dosing regimen (geometric mean: 266 µg/mL vs 260 µg/mL). The 
simulated steady state elotuzumab trough concentrations with this Q4W dosing regimen were slightly lower 
than those with the 10 mg/kg Q2W dosing regimen (geometric mean: 124 µg/mL vs 179 µg/mL) but were 
maintained above 70 µg/ml, the minimum trough for efficacy and saturation of SLAMF7 by elotuzumab. 
Some uncertainties remain with the provided exposure-response relationships with Cmin and Cmax. The 
main issue involves using a daily Cmin, daily Caverage, and daily Cmax. These exposure measures do not 
reflect  the  fluctuations  in  concentration  over  the  dosing  interval  and  therefore  the  exposure-response 
analysis is not sensitive to detect any differences in efficacy or safety between the Q2W 10 mg/kg and Q4W 
20 mg/kg dosing regimens. Furthermore, no head-to-head comparison is available between Q2W and Q4W 
in  study  CA204125.  Therefore,  the  current  dosing  regimen  can  only  be  used  for  the  combination  with 
pomalidomide/dexamethasone, as reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. This dosing regimen should not be 
used for other indications. 
According  to  the  exposure-response  analysis  presented,  it  is  unclear  whether  the  larger  fluctuation  in 
plasma-concentration  with  the  elotuzumab  20  mg/kg  Q4W  regimen,  compared  to  the  10  mg/kg  Q2W 
regimen, will result in a similar efficacy and safety, and therefore whether the 10 mg/kg Q2W regimen would 
be a more suitable dosing regimen from cycle 3 onwards. Nevertheless, the studied regimen demonstrated 
adequate efficacy. 
Comparison exposure of elotuzumab between combination of lenalidomide and pomalidomide: 
Based  on  the  results  of  the  PPK  analysis,  the  exposure  to  elotuzumab  of  the  combination  of 
pomalidomide/dexamethasone  versus  lenalidomide/dexamethasone  seems  to  be  comparable  in  terms  of 
Caverage. 
Immunogenicity:  The  number  of  patients  with  anti-drug  antibodies  in  study  CA204125  appears  to  be 
slightly higher compared to previous findings. It should however be noted that in all patients (n = 19) the 
anti-drug antibodies occurred within the first 2 months of the initiation of elotuzumab. Furthermore, in the 
majority of patients (18/19) the antibodies were resolved by 2-3 months. The influence of the ADAs on the 
pharmacokinetics seemed to be comparable as observed before, however the effect of ADAs on Kint appears 
to be different between patients on monotherapy and in combination with pomalidomide/dexamethasone. 
The applicant demonstrated that the clinical impact of the higher number of ADAs appears not to be linked 
to the new dosing regimen. Although, it should be noted that the patient numbers in the provided data are 
low.  
Pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies:  Since  mAbs  are  not  direct  inhibitors/inducers  of  metabolizing 
enzymes and are eliminated by metabolic pathways that are divergent from small molecules, direct DDIs 
between monoclonal antibodies and small molecules are generally thought to be unlikely.  
However, recent literature reports suggest therapeutic proteins that are modulators of cytokines may 
indirectly affect expression of CYP enzymes (Lee J-I, Zhang L, Men AY, Kenna LA, et al. CYP mediated 
therapeutic protein-drug interactions: clinical findings, proposed mechanisms, and regulatory implications. 
Clin Pharmacokinet 2010; 49: 295-310). Elotuzumab treatment resulted in transient changes in circulating

cytokines across the dose range 0.1 to 20 mg/kg that were not time- or dose-dependent and, therefore, 
considered not to be clinically meaningful. This observation suggests elotuzumab has a low potential for 
modulating CYP enzymes and therefore, there is a low risk to impact the PK of other drugs and for a 
therapeutic protein-drug interaction. 
Elotuzumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, which is likely eliminated via several pathways similar to that 
of  other  antibodies,  i.e.,  degradation  by  catabolism/proteolysis  (mainly  by  enzymes  in  the  cells  of 
reticuloendothelial  system),  Fcγ  receptor-mediated  clearance,  target-mediated  clearance,  nonspecific 
endocytosis,  and  formation  of  immune-complexes  followed  by  complement-  or  Fc  receptor-mediated 
clearance mechanisms. These enzymes or pathways are not known to be inhibited or induced by drugs; 
therefore, it is unlikely that other drugs will have an impact on the PK of elotuzumab. However, PPK analysis 
showed  that  the  combination  of  pomalidomide/dexamethasone  with  elotuzumab  decreased  non-specific 
(linear)  clearance  by  19%  compared  to  elotuzumab  in  combination  with  lenalidomide/dexamthasone; 
however 
this 
resulted

change 
in 
exposures.  Coadministration 
of 
pomalidomide/dexamethasone appears to significantly decrease (by ~51%) target-mediated elotuzumab 
elimination  in  the  peripheral  compartment  (by  decreasing  Kint)  compared  to  coadministration  of 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone.  As  a  result,  Cmin1  was  ~10%  higher  in  subjects  administered 
pomalidomide/dexamethasone  compared  to  those  administered  lenalidomide/dexamethasone.  However, 
this  effect  is  transient  (according  to  the  model  the  target  pool  in  the  peripheral  compartment  is  not 
renewable) and does not influence the steady-state exposure. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The updated clinical pharmacology data are acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Exposure-response studies 
An exposure-response analysis using a cox proportional hazards (CPH) model was conducted to characterise 
the  relationship  between  elotuzumab  daily  time-varying  average  concentration  (daily  Cavg),  as  the 
exposure measure, and progression free survival, as the efficacy measure.  
Efficacy analysis 
The hazard ratio (HR) of PFS at 95th percentile relative to 5th percentile of Cavg1 was predicted from the 
final model, in order to understand the impact of elotuzumab exposure on PFS. Results are presented in the 
table below. 
Table 5 Model Estimated Hazard Ratio of PFS (Relative to Median Cavg: 121 ug/mL) 
Elotuzumab exposure-response analyses for efficacy (PFS) and safety (Grade 3+ AEs) endpoints in 
CA204125 were conducted with daily time-varying trough (daily Cmin) and peak (daily Cmax) and gave 
similar results to these analyses with daily Cavg. The results of the CPH models for efficacy and safety with 
these exposure measures with daily Cavg are presented in the tables below.

2.4.2.  Dose response studies

is 10 mg/kg administered IV every week for the first 2 cycles (each cycle is 28 days long) and 10 mg/kg IV

Q2W thereafter. In studies CA204125 and CA204142, a less frequent elotuzumab dosing regimen was 
evaluated in combination with pomalidomide/dexamethasone: 10 mg/kg administered IV every week for the 
first two cycles (each cycle is 28 days long) and 20 mg/kg Q4W thereafter (Cycle 3 and beyond). The 
planned dose intensity was the same (i.e., 5 mg/kg/week) between 10 mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W. 
The recommended elotuzumab dosing regimen for the new indication in the current application is 10 mg/kg 
administered IV every week for the first 2 cycles and 20 mg/kg Q4W thereafter. This dose was essentially 
selected on the basis of simulations and modelling using the data from the already approved dose regimen 
in combination with lenalidomide (i.e., 10 mg/kg every week for the first 2 cycles and 10 mg/kg Q2W 
thereafter) and the results of the Phase 2 HuLuc63-1703 study, where safety and efficacy of 10 and 20 
mg/kg (Q2W) was evaluated.

A  cycle  was  defined  as  28  days.  Treatment  with  study  drug  continued  until  disease  progression, 
unacceptable  toxicity  or  other  criteria  for  discontinuation  of  study  drug  (i.e.  pregnancy,  withdrawal  of 
informed  consent,  any  non-protocol  specified  systemic  anti-myeloma  therapy  before  documented 
progression).  
Elotuzumab dose reductions were not permitted and doses that fell outside of the pre-specified window for 
Cycles 1 and 2 were to be skipped. In Cycle 3 and beyond, elotuzumab dosing could be delayed by up to 1 
week as clinically indicated.  
Pomalidomide dose delay was permitted as clinically indicated at the discretion of the Investigator. Dose 
reductions followed the approved pomalidomide prescribing information. 
Dexamethasone dose delay and reduction were performed as clinically indicated, at the discretion of the 
Investigator. 
Overall,  subjects  might  continue  on  study  therapy  even  if  components  of  the  study  therapy  were 
discontinued. Subjects experiencing a 56 day delay in all study drugs (pomalidomide, dexamethasone, and 
elotuzumab)  due  to  an  adverse  event  related  to  study  treatment  were  discontinued  from  study  drug.

Subjects experiencing delays unrelated to study therapy, for example due to radiation therapy, may delay 
study treatment up to 84 days.  
Concomitant treatments 
Subjects  received  thromboembolic  prophylaxis  (e.g.  aspirin,  low  molecular  weight  heparin  or  vitamin  K 
antagonists)  as  per  institutional  guidelines  or  PI  discretion.  All  patients  received  premedication  as  per 
elotuzumab SmPC (i.e. H1 blocker diphenhydramine 25 - 50 mg po or IV or equivalent, H2 blocker ranitidine 
50 mg IV or equivalent, acetaminophen 650 - 1000 mg po). To be re-treated with elotuzumab, subjects with 
a prior infusion reaction received H1, H2 blockers and acetaminophen at maximum doses specified. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
To compare PFS between treatment arms (E-Pd versus Pd). 
Secondary Objectives 
To compare objective response rate and overall survival between treatment arms 
Exploratory Efficacy Objectives 
To  assess  the  time  to  response  and  duration  of  response;  the  relationship  between  changes  in  soluble 
SLAMF7  (sSLAMF7)  from  baseline  and  response;  the  relationship  between  baseline  measurements  of 
sSLAMF7 and PFS; the relationship between baseline levels of SLAMF7 expression on MM cells and NK cells 
and response to treatment; the relationship between the gene expression profile at baseline and while on 
therapy  to  clinical  response;  the  association  between  cytogenetic  risk  and  response;  the  relationship 
between M-protein and molecular Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) status, the patient-reported outcomes in 
disease-related symptoms using MDASI-MM and EQ-5D. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Tumour response assessment 
Subjects  had  protocol-specified  tumour  assessments  every  Q4W  from  the  first  study  drug  dose  until 
confirmed disease progression, death, or withdrawal of consent. The efficacy endpoints, PFS and ORR, were 
based on analysis of serum and urine electrophoresis (SPEP and UPEP), sFLC (for those with sFLC disease 
only),  corrected  calcium  (serum  calcium  and  serum  albumin),  imaging  (radiologic/MRI  evaluation  of 
extramedullary  plasmacytoma  and  lytic  bone  lesions  if  clinically  indicated  and  at  the  time  of  CR/sCR 
assessments) and bone marrow assessments (analyzed in local laboratory to confirm CR/sCR, if applicable, 
or  at  time of  suspected  disease  progression  if  clinically  indicated).  IHC  and/or  flow  cytometry  were  also 
performed to assess for sCR. Assessments for SPEP/UPEP, SIFE/UIFE, and sFLC were performed at a central 
laboratory, whereas all the others were based on local analysis at the site. 
All response and progression criteria were based on the standard International Myeloma Working Group 
(IMWG) response criteria, with the exception of minor (minimal) response, which is in accordance to the 
EBMT definition. All response categories (≥PR) and progression required 2 consecutive assessments made at 
any time. 
To avoid variability in treatment outcomes assessment, serum and urine laboratory evaluations for tumour 
response assessment per IMWG criteria were performed at a central laboratory. Subjects who discontinued 
study  therapy  prior  to  progression,  without  withdrawing  consent  or  losing  the  ability  to  consent  freely, 
continued  tumour  assessments  on  the  same  schedule  used  in  the  on-treatment  period,  regardless  of 
whether  they  were  receiving  new  anti-myeloma  therapy.  Following  disease  progression,  follow-up  for

survival and subsequent anti-myeloma therapy continued every 12 weeks, or more frequently, until study 
end, subject death, or withdrawal of consent. 
Primary endpoint 
Progression-free  survival  (PFS):  The  primary  endpoint  was  PFS  as  assessed  by  the  Investigator  in 
accordance  to  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  principle.  The  primary  definition  of  PFS  was  the  time  from 
randomization to the date of the first documented tumour progression or death due to any cause. Subjects 
who neither progressed nor died were censored on the date of their last adequate tumour assessment and 
subjects who didn’t have any post-baseline tumour assessments and who had not died were censored on the 
date at the randomization date. 
The  secondary  definition  of  PFS  was  the  time  in  months  from  randomization  to  the  date  of  the  first 
documented  tumour  progression  or  death  due  to  any  cause,  provided  death  does  not  occur  more  than 
10 weeks (2 or more assessment visits) after the last tumour assessment. Subjects were censored at the 
last adequate assessment prior to the start of any  subsequent systemic therapy or at the last adequate 
assessment prior to 2 missing assessments (>10 weeks). Also, subjects who died more than 10 weeks after 
the randomization date and had no on-treatment assessment were censored at the randomization date. 
Secondary endpoints 
Objective response rate (ORR): ORR was defined as the proportion of randomized subjects who achieve a 
best response of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response 
(VGPR) or partial response (PR) using the modified IMWG criteria as per investigator’s assessment. 
Overall survival (OS): OS is the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause. The survival 
time for subjects who had not died was censored at the last known alive date. OS was censored at the date 
of randomization for subjects who were randomized but had no follow-up. 
Main efficacy exploratory endpoints 
Time to response (TTR): TTR is the time from randomization to the first objective documentation of PR or 
better. 
Duration of response (DoR): DOR is measured from the time that the criteria for objective response are first 
met until the date of a progression event/death. 
Time to next treatment (TTNT): TTNT is the time from randomisation to the earliest start date of subsequent 
myeloma systemic therapy or death, whichever occurred first. Subjects who did not receive any subsequent 
anti-MM therapy or died were censored at the date of their last follow-up visit. TTNT was analyzed post-hoc. 
The main efficacy outcomes were also assessed by an ad-hoc blinded IRC. This ad hoc IRC efficacy analysis 
was based on the clinical 21-Feb-2018 DBL and completed and locked on 15-May-2018. The IRC members 
were provided blinded listings of all laboratory and imaging results. These listings did not include information 
regarding potential elotuzumab interference with SIFE results and subsequent therapies. 
Sample size 
The  study  required  at  least  71  PFS  events  (progressions  or  deaths),  for  a  two-sided  experiment-wise 
alpha=0.2 log-rank test, to show a statistically significant difference in PFS between the treatment groups 
with 85% power when the true HR of the experimental group to the control group is 0.57, assuming an 
exponential distribution.

Objective response rate was a secondary objective for this study. With a sample size of 114 subjects, there 
was at least 90% power to detect a 23% improvement in response rate, using a two-sided 0.2 level test, in 
the E-Pd arm (to 58%) compared with a response rate of 35% in the Pd arm.  
OS was another secondary objective for this study. The final analysis of OS was planned to be conducted 
after 78 deaths have been observed from 114 subjects. This is expected to occur 18 months (1.5 years) from 
the time of the final PFS analysis. With 78 events the study had 75% power using a two-sided log-rank test 
at an alpha= 0.2 level, to show a statistically significant difference when the true hazard ratio is 0.64. This 
is  equivalent  to  demonstrating  a  56%  improvement  in  median  OS,  i.e.,  19.8  months  in  the  E-Pd  arm 
compared to a median OS in the Pd arm of 12.7 months. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized to either E-Pd (Elotuzumab arm) or Pd alone (Control arm) in a 1:1 ratio using the 
interactive voice response system (IVRS). The randomization was stratified by the following factors and was 
carried out via permuted blocks within each stratum: number of lines of prior therapy (2-3 vs. ≥ 4); ISS 
stage (I-II vs. III) at study entry. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The following subject populations were used for the statistical analyses: 
• 
All enrolled subjects: All subjects who gave signed informed consent and who were entered in the 
IVRS 
• 
• 
Randomized subjects: All enrolled subjects who were randomized 
Treated subjects: All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication 
(pomalidomide, dexamethasone, or elotuzumab) 
The analysis of baseline characteristics, efficacy and subject-reported outcomes were carried out on the 
Randomized subjects population, with subjects grouped according to the treatment arm to which they were 
randomized. The analysis of extent of exposure and safety were based on the Treated subjects population, 
with subjects grouped according to the treatment received (i.e. the randomization arm unless they received 
the wrong treatment throughout the study). 
Analysis methods 
For the time to event endpoints of PFS and OS, a stratified Cox proportional hazard model with treatment 
arm as single covariate was used to report the hazard ratio of E-Pd to Pd and its corresponding 80% (and 
95%) confidence interval (CI). The stratification factors were the same as those used in the randomization.  
The distribution function for each treatment arm and corresponding median were estimated via the 
Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Two-sided 95% CI for the median time to event were computed for each 
randomized arm by the Brookmeyer and Crowley method. Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS and OS are presented. 
For duration of response similar methods were applied, but no p-values were estimated given the 
exploratory nature of the endpoints.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/534722/2019 
Page 29/73 
 
  
  
 
Objective response rate was a secondary objective. A two-sided alpha= 0.2 level Cochran Mantel Haenszel 
(CMH) test, stratified using the same factors as in PFS, was used to compare the response rate between the 
treatment arms. A CMH estimate of the treatment odds ratio and its associated two-sided 80% (and 95%) 
CI were computed. The response rate, along with its exact two-sided 95% CI, were computed within each 
treatment arm. A two-sided, 95% CI for the difference of response rate between the treatment arms was 
also computed. 
The key PRO endpoints included in the exploratory objectives are the pain, bone aches, and fatigue scores 
of the MDASI-MM scale in addition to the EQ-5D visual analog scale. For these, the mean change in PRO 
scores between baseline and each post-baseline assessment were be summarized by treatment arm. The 
remaining subscales of MDASI-MM and the EQ-5D summary index scores were also tabulated. For PROs, if 
a multi item subscale had a missing item, then the average of the remaining items was used as the Scale 
score, as long as at least half the items in that Scale are present. All analyses were conducted on randomized 
subjects with baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. 
Ancillary analyses 
The following supportive analyses were to be conducted using both the ITT and the secondary definitions of 
PFS. P-values provided for these analyses were proposed as descriptive and were to be used to evaluate the 
results in context of the primary analyses. 
1) A multivariate Cox regression model was used in order to estimate the treatment effect after adjustment 
for possible imbalances in known or potential prognostic factors. The factors used in the randomization, 
which, by definition, was to be balanced across arms, would still have included in the model as stratification 
factors. However, all additional factors were to be incorporated as covariates. The additional factors, which 
were all measured at baseline, included: age (< 75 vs. ≥75), gender (male vs. female), ECOG PS (0-1 vs. 2), 
prior stem cell transplantation (yes vs. no), high myeloma risk (yes vs. no) [see Section 7.5.1.2 for details], 
time from initial diagnosis, creatinine clearance (<60ml/min vs.  ≥ 60ml/min), and LDH (< 300IU/L, 
≥ 300IU/L). 
2) PFS using stratification factors as obtained from the baseline CRF pages (instead of IVRS). The p-value 
and the hazard ratio associated with treatment was to be presented along with the associated 2-sided 80% 
and 95% CIs. This analysis was to be performed only if a difference of 10% in strata between the IVRS and 
CRF pages was observed. 
3) PFS using an un-stratified log rank test. The p-value and hazard ratio associated with treatment was to be 
presented along with its associated two-sided 80% and 95% CIs. 
4) PFS using an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted, using as covariates only the two 
stratification factors used in randomization. The p-value and hazard ratio associated with treatment was to 
be presented along with its associated two-sided 80% and 95% CIs. 
5) PFS for subjects with no relevant deviation. These analyses were to be conducted only if more than 5% 
subjects with relevant protocol deviations were observed. The p-value and hazard ratio associated with 
treatment were to be presented along with its associated two-sided 80% and 95% CIs. 
A by-subject listing was to be presented including treatment arm, PFS duration under the primary definition, 
PFS duration under the secondary definition, whether the subject was censored under the primary definition, 
and if censored, the reason, and whether the subject was censored under the secondary definition, and if 
censored, the reason. 
Interim analyses  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/534722/2019 
Page 30/73 
 
  
  
 
An interim review meeting was planned to be conducted after 70 subjects were randomized and followed for 
at least 2 months. This meeting was expected to take place approximately 8 months after the first patient is 
randomized. Along with safety, efficacy data including response rate and PFS were to be reviewed at that 
time. It was not intended for this interim review to include any formal comparison of efficacy endpoints and 
there were be no plans to stop the trial early for benefit or futility. No adjustments were made at the time of 
the final efficacy analysis because of this interim look.  
At the time of the database lock for this interim analysis, 17-May-2017, enrolment was nearly complete with 
111 subjects of the 114 planned having been randomized in the study. However, the efficacy data were not 
mature (i.e., < 50% of PFS events planned for the final analysis, short follow-up) to inform any decision 
making at this interim analysis. Subsequent to this interim analysis, no changes were made to the protocol 
or the statistical plan. According to the MAH, the results of this interim analysis were not shared with study 
investigators, and were not disclosed externally (i.e., no presentations or publications).

Recruitment 
A total of 157 subjects were enrolled at 43 sites in 11 countries (US, Canada, Japan,  France, Germany, 
Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and Australia). One-hundred and fifteen subjects were treated 
across 39 sites in 10 countries. Overall, 74.4% of randomised subjects were enrolled in Europe. One subject 
was enrolled but not randomized in Australia. The first subject was randomized on 18-Apr-2016 and last 
subject was randomized on 22-May-2017. For the current analysis, last patient last visit date (LPLV) was 
17-Jan-2018. 
Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol (dated 02-sep-2015) was subsequently amended 5 times (up to 11 may 2016, 
date of last amendment). The changes were essentially administrative or related to study procedures in 
specific sites, but they did not significantly affect global study conduct.

55 in the Pd arm). The analyses presented are related to a cut-off date of 21 February 2018. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint - Progression Free Survival (PFS) according to INV – ITT definition  
The PFS analysis per investigator assessment was based on 75 events (32 (53.3%) in the E-Pd group and 43 
(75.4%) in the Pd group).  
PFS demonstrated a statistically significant increase with E-Pd compared with Pd (stratified HR 0.54, 95% CI 
0.34, 0.86, p=0.0078). Median PFS was 10.25 months in the E-Pd arm and 4.67 months in the Pd arm. The 
1-year PFS rate was 40% in the E-Pd group and 19% in the Pd group.

Secondary objective: Objective Response Rate (ORR) - INV 
Objective response rate (ORR=CR + VGPR + PR + stringent (s)CR) was significantly higher in the E-Pd arm 
compared with the Pd arm: 53.3% vs 26.3%. A VGPR or better response rate was 20% in the E-Pd arm 
compared with 8.8% in the Pd arm. CMH estimate of Odds Ratio was 3.25 (95% CI: 1.49, 7.11, p=0.0029). 
The median time to response was 1.95 and 1.91 months in the E-Pd and Pd arm, respectively. 
The median duration of response was not reached in the E-Pd arm and 8.31 months in the Pd arm. 
Secondary objective – Overall Survival (OS) 
A total of 31 death events (26.9%, 13 in the E-Pd arm and 18 in the Pd arm) of the 78 events (39.7%) 
required for the final analysis were observed at the time of the data cut off (21 February 2018).

In the ITT population a numerical but not statistically significant difference in OS was observed between 
treatment arms (HR=0.62, 95% CI 0.30-1.28, p=Not Reported). Median OS was not reached in both arms. 
The 1-year OS rate was 0.77 in the E-Pd group and 0.67 in the Pd group.

In the response document, the Applicant provided the outline of an updated OS analysis with cut-off date 29 
November 2018, after a minimum follow-up of 18.3 months. At that time a total of 48 death events were 
observed,  representing  41%  of  the  patients  randomized  and  61%  of  the  requested  OS  events  for  the 
planned final analysis (projected to be conducted in December 2020).

Exploratory objective: Patient-Reported Outcomes: FACT-Hep and EQ-5D  
Patient-reported  outcomes  in  disease-related  symptoms  using  2  questionnaires,  MDASI-MM  which 
measures symptoms, and EQ-5D which measures health status were exploratory endpoints of the study. 
-  Overall,  change  from  baseline  in  key  MDASI-MM  scores  (pain,  fatigue,  and  bone  aches)  was  similar 
between treatment groups, suggesting that the addition of elotuzumab to Pd does not lead to deterioration 
of HRQoL as compared to Pd alone.  
- Overall, change from baseline in EQ-5D-3L scores was similar between treatment groups, suggesting that 
the addition of elotuzumab to Pd does not lead to deterioration of HRQoL as compared to Pd alone.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/534722/2019

Compliance  rate  was  higher  for  E-Pd  than  Pd  between  treatment  groups  for  both  questionnaires.  The 
number of subjects with both baseline and on-treatment questionnaire for MDASI-MM Scores and EQ-5D-3L 
were  51  for  E-Pd  (85.0%)  vs.  41  for  Pd  (71.9%)  and  53  for  E-Pd  (88.3%)  vs.  45  for  Pd  (78.9%), 
respectively. 
Ancillary analyses 
The  results  of  the  pre-specified  sensitivity/supportive  analyses  of  PFS  were  consistent  with  the  primary 
analysis: 
• A multivariate Cox regression model, adjusting for possible imbalances in pre-specified prognostic factors, 
yielded an HR (E-Pd/Pd) of 0.50; P-value= 0.0263) consistent with the primary analysis. One factor which 
had  a  statistically  significant  effect  on  PFS  was  high  risk  myeloma  cytogenetics  (HR,  no  vs  yes  =  0.41; 
P-value = 0.0338. Another potentially important factor is ECOG performance status (HR, ECOG 0 or 1 vs 2 
= 0.40; P-value = 0.0657). 
• The primary PFS finding is further supported by the following analyses comparing E-Pd to Pd: 
- A stratified log-rank test/Cox model using stratification factors as entered on CRF (instead of IVRS): HR = 
0.56; P-value = 0.0153). 
- An unstratified log-rank test/Cox model: HR = 0.53; P-value = 0.0065. 
- An unstratified Cox model using as covariates the two stratification factors recorded at randomization: HR 
= 0.53; P-value = 0.0069. 
Post-Hoc analyses – PFS and ORR according to IRC 
A post-hoc analysis of PFS and ORR as assessed by an IRC was provided by the Applicant to support the 
primary analyses.  
PFS according to IRC 
The concordance between IRC and investigator (INV) assessments for event (progressive disease or death) 
and censoring was 85.5%. Based on the ITT definition there was a 49% reduction in the risk of progression 
or death associated with E-Pd treatment  
A  statistically  significant  improvement  in  PFS  was  observed  in  the  E-Pd  arm  compared  with  the  Pd  arm 
(hazard ratio [HR], E-Pd/Pd: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.82] 2-sided stratified log-rank P-value = 0.0043, mPFS 
10.25 vs 4.7 months, respectively).  
ORR according to IRC 
The  ORR  analysis  according  to  IRC  was  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis:  a  statistically  significant 
improvement in ORR was  observed in the E-Pd arm compared with the Pd arm (E-Pd group: 58.3%, Pd 
group: 24.6%). The concordance of ORR (i.e., responder or non-responder) per IRC and INV was 91.5%. 
The concordance of best overall response (BOR) per IRC and INV with respect to the categories of response 
was 65.8%. No patient in the E-Pd group achieved CR or sCR at the IRC assessment, as was expected given 
that the blinded listings provided to the IRC did not include information on potential elotuzumab interference 
with serum immunofixation results. Odds ratio (E-Pd/Pd): 4.62 [95% CI: 2.05, 10.43]; 2- sided P-value = 
0.0002). There was a very good partial response (VGPR) or better response rate of 15.0% in the E-Pd group 
and 8.8% in the Pd group. 
Time to response: median TTR was 1.91 and 1.03 months in the E-Pd and Pd arm, respectively. 
Duration of response: median DoR was 12.02 and 8.31 months in the E-Pd and Pd arm, respectively. 
Time to Next Treatment (TTNT) - Ad-hoc Endpoint - CA204125 
An ad-hoc endpoint of TTNT was analyzed. TTNT was defined as the time from randomization to the earliest 
start date of subsequent myeloma systemic therapy or death, whichever occurred first. Subjects who did not 
receive any subsequent anti-myeloma therapy or died were censored at the date of their last follow- up visit. 
Per protocol, subjects were to receive treatment until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity 
or consent withdrawal. At database lock (21-Feb-2018), 36 (60.0%) E-Pd and 44 (80.0%) Pd subjects 
discontinued treatment. Reason for discontinuation was confirmed disease progression per IMWG criteria in 
26 (72.2%) of discontinued E-Pd subjects and 31 (70.5%) of the discontinued Pd subjects, suggesting these 
subjects needed further treatment.

At database lock (21-Feb-2018), 24 (40%) and 30 (52.6%) subjects in the E-Pd and Pd groups, respectively, 
had initiated subsequent systemic therapy, mostly due to disease progression.

Design 
Study CA204125 is a Phase 2, randomized, open-label study investigating the 
activity  of  the  elotuzumab  plus  pomalidomide  and  dexamethasone  (E-Pd) 
regimen  compared  to  the  standard  pomalidomide  plus  dexamethasone 
combination  (Pd)  in  subjects  with  relapsed  and  refractory  multiple  myeloma 
(RRMM). Eligible subjects were randomized to either treatment group in a 1:1 
ratio  and  subject  randomization  was  stratified  by  number  of  lines  of  prior 
therapy (2-3 vs. ≥ 4); ISS stage (I-II vs. III) at study entry. All cycles were 28 
days in duration (weekly Elotuzumab in Cycles 1 & 2, every 4 weeks starting 
from Cycle 3).  
Duration of main phase: 
Subjects received either E-pd or Pd until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 
study drug discontinuation. 
First patient first visit (FPFV): 18-Apr-2016 
Last patient last visit (LPLV): 17-Jan-2018

Supportive study 
Study CA204142 
Methods 
Study CA204142 was a Phase 2, multi-cohort multi-center, open-label study of elotuzumab in combination 
with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (E-Pd) and elotuzumab in combination with nivolumab 
(EN) to assess the safety and efficacy of these combination therapies in previously treated MM subjects. 
Study design is summarised in Figure below.

The objective of the E-Pd cohort was to explore the clinical benefit and tolerability of the E-Pd combination 
in subjects with MM who received at least 1 prior therapy and were relapsed, refractory, or intolerant to prior 
treatment with lenalidomide. 
PFS was the primary endpoint, defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first documented 
progression per IMWG uniform criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Subjects who did 
not have any on-study efficacy assessments and did not die were censored on the first dosing date. Subjects 
who switched to subsequent therapy prior to documented progression were censored on the date of the last 
adequate tumour assessment prior to the initiation of the new therapy. A secondary definition of PFS based 
on the ITT analysis whereby progressions or deaths were considered events, regardless of the subsequent 
therapy initiation date, was also included as sensitivity analysis.  
Secondary endpoints included ORR, DOR, TTR, and OS. 
Medians and associated 95% CIs for PFS, DOR and OS were based on the K-M method. ORR and its 95% CI 
were based on the Clopper-Pearson method for binomial data. 
Results 
This study was conducted in the US: 86 subjects were enrolled at 18 sites, of whom 68 were treated with 
E-Pd. The first patient first treatment (FPFT) was on 09-Feb-2016 and last patient first treatment (LPFT) was 
on 08-Dec-2016. For the current analysis, LPLV was 12-Jan-2018 and the clinical DBL was 04-Apr-2018.  
At the DBL, 13 (19.1%) subjects were still on treatment. 55 (80.9%) subjects discontinued treatment with 
disease progression (26 [38.2%]) being the most common reason for discontinuation of treatment. Other 
relevant reasons for discontinuation were study drug toxicity (11.8%), death (2/68, 2.9%) and maximum 
clinical benefit (14.7%).

In the treated subjects, the median age was 66.5 years (range: 39 - 88 years) with 10.3% of the subjects 
≥75  years  of  age.  The  majority  of  the  subjects  were  white  (85.3%)  and  male  (51.5%).  Key  disease 
characteristics were as follows: ECOG performance status was 0 for 57.4% of the subjects, 1 for 39.7%, and 
2 for 2.9%; the median time from disease diagnosis was 38.39 (range: 5.7 - 172.6) months; the mean (SD) 
serum M-protein (quantitative serum protein electrophoresis) level was 14.5 (13.72) g/L and the mean (SD) 
urine  M-protein  level  was  0.119  (0.2792)  g/day;  the  ISS  stage  at  study  entry  was  I  for  64.7%  of  the 
subjects, II for 20.6%, and III for 10.3%.; 41.2% had > 3 lytic bone lesions and 10.3% of the subjects had 
known plasmacytomas at baseline. The most common myeloma type was IgG (58.8%) followed by IgA type 
(20.6%) and light-chain only disease (11.8%). 
The  median  number  of  prior  systemic  therapies  was  2  (range:  1  -  5)  with  41  (60.3%)  of  the  subjects 
receiving  ≥  2  therapies.  Only  6  subjects  had  received  ≥  3  prior  therapies.  All  subjects  had  received 
lenalidomide;  86.8%  had  received  bortezomib.  The  most  frequently  received  prior  therapies  included: 
bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone  (32.4%)  and  lenalidomide/dexamethasone  (17.6%).  Overall, 
55.9% of subjects had a prior SCT and 27.9% of subjects had prior radiotherapy. 
Subjects received a median of 9 cycles (range: 1 - 25) of treatment. The median treatment duration for all 
treated  subjects  was  7.5  months  for  elotuzumab,  8.0  months  for  pomalidomide,  and  7.7  months  for 
dexamethasone. The minimum follow-up at the time of DBL was 16 months. 
Results  from  study  CA204142  in  the  overall  population  and  in  subjects  with  ≥  2  prior  therapies 1  are 
summarised in Table below:

Table 11: Overall Efficacy Summary – Study CA204142 
The INV-assessed ORR was 51.5% (95% CI: 39.0, 63.8) with 2 (2.9%) subjects achieving a CR. VGPR or 
better (deep response) was observed in 9 (13.2%) of subjects. The median TTR was 2.79 (range: 0.95 - 
13.83) months. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Within  this  type  II  variation  procedure  the  MAH  requested  the  extension  of  indication  for  elotuzumab 
(Empliciti) to a combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with MM 
who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.  
The proposed elotuzumab dose regimen for the new indication is 10 mg/kg every week for the first 2 cycles 
and 20 mg/kg Q4W thereafter. This dose has been essentially selected on the basis of simulations and 
modelling using the data from the already approved dose regimen in combination with lenalidomide (i.e., 10 
mg/kg every week for the first 2 cycles and 10 mg/kg Q2W thereafter) and the results of the Phase 2 
HuLuc63-1703 study, where safety and efficacy of 10 and 20 mg/kg (Q2W) was evaluated.

Regarding the applied dose regimen in the Pd arm this was in line with the SmPC recommendation and as in 
the previously performed pivotal study that supported the approval of the combination. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
The evidence of efficacy of elotuzumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients 
with MM is based on the results of one pivotal phase II study (CA204125), supported by the data of the E-Pd 
cohort of the phase II CA204142 study.  
Study CA204125 is a phase II, multicenter, multinational, randomized (1:1), open label study. The study 
was originally not designed to support regulatory decision-making, as demonstrated by the alpha-spending 
(0.2) which was more relaxed than usually required for regulatory confirmatory purposes (i.e., 0.05) and by 
the lack of pre-planned evaluation of primary (PFS) and key secondary (ORR) endpoints according to an 
independent  review  committee  (IRC),  which  could  have  been  considered  appropriate  in  view  of  the 
open-label  design  of  the  study  and  the  fact  that  the  endpoints  like  PFS  and  ORR  can  be  subject  to 
investigator’s bias. An analysis according to an IRC has been conducted post-hoc.  
A total of 117 patients with MM previously treated with at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide 
and a proteasome inhibitor and with demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy were randomized 
(1:1)  to  receive  E-Pd  or  Pd.  The  two  arms  design  of  the  study  with  Pd  as  comparator  is  considered 
acceptable, as Pd represents one of the treatment options available in the target population.  
PFS was the primary study endpoint which is considered appropriate for the proposed target population, 
considering the relatively long life expectancy and the presence of post-study treatment options able to 
affect survival. Moreover, an updated, descriptive OS analysis supports a beneficial effect of E-Pd compared 
with Pd. Although the percentage of patients receiving post-study therapies in the Pd arm was higher than 
in  the  E-Pd  arm,  some  concerns  were  raised  over  the  higher  percentage  of  patients  with  reintroduction 
post-study of drugs like lenalidomide (3.3% vs 12.3%) or PIs (e.g. carfilzomib, 8.3% vs 15.8%) that could 
potentially have a detrimental effect on OS due to the claimed refractory status to these classes of agents. 
It  was  noted  that  cross-over  was  not  allowed  in  the  CA204125  study  and  that,  in  view  of  the  already 
registered  indication,  it  would  not  have  been  (easily)  possible  to  receive  elotuzumab  post-study  for  the 
patients enrolled. Evaluation of health related quality of life was also performed but the reliability of the 
results  is  challenged  by  the  open-label  design  of  the  study.  A  biomarker  analysis  was  also  planned  as 
exploratory: results will be provided at the time of final OS analysis.   
MM  is  a  heterogeneous  condition,  and  the  representativeness  of  the  studied  population  is  an  essential 
prerequisite to guarantee that the observed results are generalizable to the target population. In this regard, 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria for study CA204125 mostly replicated those employed in the registrational 
study for pomalidomide (Phase III study CC-4047-MM-003), focusing on subjects who were refractory or 
relapsed and refractory to lenalidomide and a PI. Since MM patients are extensively exposed to lenalidomide 
and PIs in earlier stages of disease, this is considered acceptable in order to select patients in an advanced 
stage of relapse. It is noted, however, that the definition for “relapsed and refractory” used in the pivotal 
study  CA204125  (i.e.  refractory  to  their  last  treatment  having  previously  achieved  at  least  a  PR  with 
lenalidomide and/or a PI and progressed within 6 months) differed from the IMWG consensus definition (i.e. 
patients that are nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy, have 
achieved minimal response or better at some point previously and then progressed in their disease course). 
The Applicant provided justifications to support generalizability of the results of the CA204125 study to the 
target disease population of RRMM who failed at least 2 prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a PI. In 
particular, the Applicant aimed to demonstrate similarity of the CA204125 study population to the MM-003 
population as well as to the RRMM population as reflected in real world data reported in the literature. The 
Applicant  speculated  that  the  identified  difference  in  median  number  of  previous  therapies  in  patients 
enrolled  in  the  CA204125  study  (i.e.,  3)  vs  MM-003  study  (i.e.,  5)  can  be  related  to  a  rapidly  evolving 
treatment paradigm in multiple myeloma, with more patients potentially pre-treated with triplet in the more 
recently performed CA204125 study. Similarly, the Applicant justified the apparently prolonged survival in 
the control arm of the CA204125 study (17.4 months) compared with the MM-003 trial and other real world 
data (range 13-15 months) by the potential availability of new (post-study) therapies in the recent years. 
Although the explanations provided could be considered plausible, it is noted that actually no data have been

published from study MM-003 in order to substantiate such statements. Information regarding the actual 
number of patients pre-treated with triplet as well as on differences in post-study therapies received by 
patients has been made available from study CA204125.      
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results of the primary PFS analysis based on 75 (64%, cut-off 21 Feb 2018) events show a statistically 
significant improvement in PFS for E-Pd compared with Pd (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.86, p=0.0078), with a 
gain in median PFS of about 5.58 months in favour of E-Pd (median PFS 10.25 vs 4.67 months, respectively). 
The observed PFS improvement is considered of potential clinical relevance when supported by secondary 
endpoints  and  by  a  tolerable  toxicity  profile.  The  robustness  of  the  PFS  effect  is  supported  by  several 
sensitivity analyses, the results of which are in line with the primary analysis, including also the results of a 
post-hoc analysis where PFS was assessed by an IRC. The effect on PFS was observed in most subgroups of 
the population. However, results should be taken with caution in view of the very limited number of patients 
included in most of the subgroups examined. 
Regarding the secondary endpoints, consistency was observed in terms of ORR according to INV (53.3% vs 
26.3%, with VGPR or better: 20% vs 8%) as well as post-hoc according to IRC (concordance rate 91%). 
Responses  with  the  proposed  E-Pd  regimen  were  durable:  at  the  time  of  the  last  data  cut-off  date 
(29/11/2018), results in the control arm were mature, with a median DoR of 10.84 months (95%CI 4.63, 
22.8). Conversely, only 13/31 (42%) of subjects experienced an event in the E-Pd arm, with a median DoR 
of 23.1 months (95%CI 13.37, 23.10). The results of the updated, descriptive OS analysis (cut off 29 Nov 
2018) after a minimum follow-up of 18.3 months and 48 death events (representing 41% of the patients 
randomized  and  61%  of  the  requested  OS  events  for  the  planned  final  analysis)  appear  in  line  with  the 
primary analysis and are supportive for a superiority of E-Pd vs Pd (HR 0.54 (95% CI 0.30-0.96), median OS 
NR in the E-Pd arm and 17.41 months in the Pd arm). The majority of patients received additional systemic 
therapy post-study, reflecting the treatment options currently available for this population. Of note is the 
number of patients receiving post-study lenalidomide in the control arm (12.3% vs 3.3% in the E-Pd arm) 
and  a  proteasome  inhibitor  (e.g.  carfilzomib  (8.3%  vs  15.8%)).  Re-treatment  of  patients  with  these 
compounds could have a detrimental effect on OS. This issue, together with unbalances observed in the 
triplet combinations received pre-study, should be further discussed by the Applicant post-approval, at the 
time final OS results will be presented. 
No  compelling  data  on  Molecular  Minimal  Residual  Disease  (MRD)  nor  the  results  of  the  exploratory 
biomarker analysis to be performed in patients treated in the CA204125 study have been provided by the 
Applicant but they will be submitted post-approval at the time the results of the final OS analysis will be 
provided. 
The quality of life evaluation did not show any significant difference between the two study arms overtime 
regarding the domains analysed, indicating no detrimental effect but also no improvement by addition of 
elotuzumab to Pd. However, the results of the analysis should be taken with caution in view of the open label 
design of the study. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A statistically and clinically significant improvement in PFS with E-Pd compared with Pd has been observed 
in the pivotal CA204125 study in patients with MM previously treated with at least two prior therapies 
including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on the last 
therapy. The PFS results appear mature and are supported by several sensitivity analyses including a 
post-hoc analysis according to an IRC. The primary PFS endpoint is supported by ORR results and 
exploratory OS data. Quality of life data seem to indicate no detrimental effect but also no improvements by 
addition of elotuzumab to Pd. However, reliability of the QoL results is challenged by the open label design 
of the study.  
The CHMP recommends the following post-authorisation provisions:

1.  Final OS results from study CA204125 should be provided, with detailed information on post-study 
therapies received by patients. 
2.  Additional OS analyses should be provided to evaluate the impact of the observed unbalances in the 
type of prior triplet therapies (e.g. VRD and carfilzomib-containing triple regimens) on the observed 
OS results, also considering the differences in subsequent treatments. 
3.  Data on MRD and other exploratory biomarker analyses (at the time of final OS results of CA204125 
study) should be provided. 
4.  Correct data for dose intensity from study CA204142 should be provided (see Discussion on clinical 
safety). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
For this variation procedure, safety data from a total of 682 patients with multiple myeloma treated with 
elotuzumab  in  combination  with  lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone  (451  patients),  bortezomib  and 
dexamethasone (103 patients) or pomalidomide and dexamethasone (128 patients) pooled across 8 clinical 
trials have been assessed.  
Within the studies presented in the initial MA application, the majority of reported adverse reactions were 
mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in >10% of patients) with 
elotuzumab  treatment  were  cough,  herpes  zoster,  nasopharyngitis,  pneumonia,  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection and weight decreased.  
Infection is an important identified risk of elotuzumab treatment. Apart from an increase in SAEs of infection 
(31% vs 25% for the elotuzumab arm and the control arm respectively) and deaths (n=7 vs n=2) due to 
infection,  a  higher  frequency  of  infection  AEs  (81%  vs  74%)  and  grade  3-4  AEs  (28%  vs  24%)  were 
observed  in  the  elotuzumab  arm.    The  most  serious  adverse  reaction  that  occurred  during  elotuzumab 
treatment was pneumonia. The CHMP concluded that the risk profile of elotuzumab when administered in 
combination with LD regimen is generally manageable. 
The safety data for the current indication including relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma by which 
elotuzumab will be used in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, is obtained in two clinical 
studies;  CA204125  and  CA204142.  In  the  active  arm  of  study  CA204125  elotuzumab  was  used  in 
combination  with  pomalidomide  and  dexamethasone  (E-Pd  arm)  and  patients  in  the  control  arm  were 
treated with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd arm). In study CA204142, all patients were treated with 
elotuzumab in combination with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (E-Pd). The applicant did only 
provide  pooled  data  from  the  E-Pd  groups  in  both  studies  and  data  from  the  Pd  control  group  of  study 
CA204125.   
The safety database lock was 21-Feb-2018 for study CA204125 and 04-Apr-2018 for study CA204142.

Patient exposure 
The characterization of the safety profile of elotuzumab therapy presented in this variation is derived from 
60  subjects  from  CA204125  and  68  subjects  from  CA204142  who  were  treated  in  the  E-Pd  groups.  In 
CA204125, 55 subjects were treated in the Pd group. As of the clinical database lock: 
•  In the pooled E-Pd group, 128 subjects had been treated. 
-  37 (28.9%) subjects were still on treatment 
-  91 (71.1%) discontinued treatment. The most common reason for discontinuation of treatment was 
disease progression, occurring in 52 (40.6%) subjects. 
•  In the Pd group from CA204125, 55 subjects had been treated. 
-  11 (20.0%) subjects were still on treatment 
-  44  (80.0%)  subjects  discontinued  treatment.  The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  of 
treatment was disease progression, in 31 (56.4%) subjects. 
Patients in the experimental arm (E-Pd) of study CA204125, received a median of 9 cycles (range: 1-23 
cycles) and patients in the control arm (Pd) received a median of 5 cycles (range: 1-17 cycles). In the E-Pd 
treatment  group,  the  median  duration  of  treatment  was  7.41  months  (elotuzumab),  8.05  months 
(pomalidomide), and 7.95 months (dexamethasone). The median duration of treatment with pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone in the Pd treatment group was 4.37 months and 4.17 months, respectively.  
Dose Intensity 
Most patients received the planned doses (10 mg/kg IV weekly cycle 1 and 2 and 20 mg/kg IV Q4W cycle 3 
and beyond) of elotuzumab. The 60 E-Pd patients received a total of 816 elotuzumab infusions. According to 
the protocol, dose reductions of elotuzumab were not permitted.  
Dose intensity data are provided below for the individual E-Pd groups from each study 
Elotuzumab with Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone (E-Pd) 
CA204125 E-Pd Group 
•  The majority of subjects (80.0%) received ≥90% of the relative elotuzumab dose intensity. 
•  The majority (55.0%) of the subjects received ≥90% of the planned dose intensity of pomalidomide. 
- 
In subjects who were ≤75 years old, 46.9% of subjects received ≥90% of the planned dose intensity 
of dexamethasone; in subjects >75 years old, 45.5% received ≥90% of the planned dose intensity of 
dexamethasone. 
CA204142 E-Pd Group: 
•  The majority of subjects (70.6%) received ≥90% of the relative elotuzumab dose intensity. 
•  41.2% and 39.7% of subjects received ≥90% of the planned dose intensity of the pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone doses. 
- 
In  CA204142,  elotuzumab,  pomalidomide,  and  dexamethasone  dosing  was  reported  incorrectly 
(underreported) for some subjects, which was detected after the DBL. The issue was resolved in a 
subsequent DBL and will be reported in the Final CSR. Thus, the data represent underreporting of 
dosing for all 3 agents in the E-Pd group.

Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone (Pd) 
CA204125 Pd Group: 
•  The majority of the subjects (52.7%) treated with pomalidomide received ≥ 90% of the planned dose 
intensity. 
- 
In subjects who were ≤ 75 years old, 50.0% of subjects received ≥ 90% of the planned dose intensity 
of dexamethasone; in subjects > 75 years old, 54.5% received ≥ 90% of the planned dose intensity 
of dexamethasone. 
Dose Delays or Omissions, Interruptions, and Reductions of Therapy 
E-Pd group of study CA204125  
Dose delays occurred for 20 (33.3%) subjects (of these, 53.1% lasted 2-3 days; 46.9% lasted 4-7 days) 
with  the  most  frequent  reason  being  AE  (7  subjects,  11.7%)  followed  by  non-hematologic  toxicity  (3 
subjects, 5%). Dose omission was reported for 23 (38.3%) subjects (of these, 44.8% lasted >35 days; 
34.5% for 11-14 days) mostly for AE occurrence (10 subjects, 16.7%) and “Other” reasons (11 subjects, 
18.3%) followed by non-hematologic toxicity (2 subjects, 5%). Infusion interruptions occurred in 3 (5%) 
subjects (one each) with a median duration of 45 minutes (range 15-75 minutes) with the most frequent 
reason being hypersensitivity reaction in 1 case and “Other” in the remaining 2 cases. 
As regard to pomalidomide, in the E-Pd group, dose reductions were reported for the 20% of subjects with 
AEs, non-hematologic toxicity, and hematologic toxicity being the main reasons (8.3%, 6.7%, and 3.3%, 
respectively). At least one dose interruption occurred in the 45% of subjects and the majority was due to 
adverse events (21 subjects, 35%). 
As  regard  to  dexamethasone,  the  occurrence  of  AEs  was  the  most  common  reason  for  dose  delays, 
omissions, reductions, and modifications. In particular, dexamethasone IV dose delays, dose omissions, and 
dose reductions occurred in 33.3%, 31.7%, and 6.7% of subjects, respectively. 
E-Pd group of study CA204142  
These data should be interpreted with caution due to incorrect reporting. 
Elotuzumab  dose  omission,  infusion  interruption,  and  IV  rate  reduction  occurred  in  33.8%,  14.7%,  and 
5.9% of subjects, respectively, with the latter two being more common than in the E-Pd group of study 
CA204125 (38.3%, 5%, and 0, respectively). The most frequent reasons were “Other” for dose omissions 
(19.1%) and infusion interruption (8.8%); for the latter another reason was infusion reaction (3 subjects, 
4.4%). 
Pomalidomide dose omissions were reported in 61.8% of patients (there were ≥4 dose omissions in 26.5%), 
dose  reductions  in  20.6%  and  for  both  the  most  frequent  reason  was  “Other”  (54.4%  and  14.7%, 
respectively), followed by dosing error for dose omissions (11.8%). As regard with dexamethasone, 22.1% 
reported  IV  dose  delay  for  “Other”  reason  in  20.6%  of  subjects,  and  only  one  subject  (1.5%)  IV  dose 
reduction for “Other” reason.

Twenty  percent  (20%)  of  patients  had  pomalidomide  dose  reductions  mostly  related  to  adverse  events, 
non-hematologic  and  hematologic  toxicity;  similarly,  most  dose  interruptions  (38.2%)  were  due  to  AEs. 
Dexamethasone PO dose modifications occurred in 47.3% of patients mostly due to AEs (30.9%). 
Adverse events 
On study AEs were defined as non-serious or serious with an onset date on or after the first dose of any study 
drug until 60 days after the last dose of any study drugs.  
Key safety findings are summarized in the Table below: 
Table 12 Summary of Safety Results- All treated subjects 
At least 1 AE of any causality was reported in the majority of subjects in the pooled E-Pd group (98.4%) and 
in Pd group (94.5%). 
The most common AEs (any grade) reported in at least 20% of the patients in either group (pooled E-Pd and 
Pd, respectively) were anaemia (23.4% and 36.4%), neutropenia (29.7% and 30.9%), diarrhoea (26.6% 
and  9.1%),  pyrexia  (13.3%  and  25.5%),  constipation  (23.4%  and  10.9%)  and  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection (23.4% and 14.5%).  
Common AEs (≥5%) reported at a more than two-fold greater proportion of E-Pd patients compared to Pd 
patients (pooled E-Pd vs Pd, respectively) included fatigue (35,9% and 16.4%), diarrhoea (26.6% vs 9.1%) 
constipation  (23.4%  vs  10.9%),  muscle  spasm  (19.5%  vs  5.5%),  dyspnoea  (19.5%  vs  7.3%),  cough 
(19.5% vs 9.1%), peripheral oedema (17.2% vs 7.3%), back pain (14.8% vs 7.3%), lymphopenia (13.3% 
vs 1.8%), leukopenia (12.5% vs 5.5%), tremor (7.8% vs 3.6%), headache (10.2% vs 3.6%), anxiety (7.0% 
vs 1.8%), dehydration (6.3% vs 1.8%)  and vomiting (5.5% vs 1.8%).  
Common AEs (≥5%) reported at a more than two-fold lower proportion in E-Pd patients compared to Pd 
patients  (pooled  E-Pd  vs  PD,  respectively)  included  malignant  neoplasm  progression  (2.3%  vs  10.9%), 
hypercalcemia (3.9% vs 9.1%), oral candidiasis (0 vs 5.5%), musculoskeletal pain (2.3% vs 7.3%), platelet

count decreased (3.1% vs 7.3%), acute kidney injury (3.1% vs 7.3%), renal failure (0.8% vs 7.3%) and 
blood creatinine increased (3.1% vs 10.9%). 
The proportion of patients with a Grade 3-4 AE was 58.6% and 60.0% in the pooled E-Pd and Pd groups, 
respectively. The most frequent (> 5%) Grade 3-4 AEs (pooled E-Pd and Pd, respectively) were neutropenia 
(14.8% and 27.3%), anaemia (7.8% and 20.0%), pneumonia (13.3% and 9.1%), lymphopenia (9.4% and 
1.8%), leukopenia (9.4% and 3.6%), neutrophil count decreased (4.7% and 9.1%),  hyperglycaemia (6.3% 
and 7.3%), thrombocytopenia (6.3% and 5.5%), febrile neutropenia (6.3% and 5.5%), and hypokalaemia 
(2.3% vs 5.5%).

Exposure  adjusted  AEs;  due  to  a  longer  duration  of  exposure  in  the  pooled  E-Pd  group  (111.51 
person-years  [P-Y]  compared  to  the  Pd  group  34.31  P-Y),  exposure-adjusted  AEs  were  calculated  as 
incidence rate per 100 patient-years (IR/100 P-Y). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for the most common 
AEs  were  (pooled  E-Pd  and  Pd,  respectively):  anaemia  (43.0  and  84.5/100  P-Y),  neutropenia  (56.5  and 
72.9/100 P-Y), fatigue (43.0 and 29.1/100 P-Y), upper respiratory tract infection (42.1 and 29.1/100 P-Y), 
leukopenia (36.8 and 8.7/100 P-Y), diarrhoea (37.7 and 17.5/100 P-Y), and cough (32.3 and 14.6/100 P-Y). 
Drug-related AEs (any grade; considered related to study drug by the investigator) were reported in 109 
(85.2%)  and  43  (78.2%)  patients  of  the  pooled  E-Pd  and  Pd  groups,  respectively.  The  most  common 
(≥10%)  drug-related  AEs  in  each  group  (pooled  E-Pd  vs  Pd,  respectively)  included  fatigue  (25.0%  and 
7.3%), neutropenia (22.7% and 20.0%), anaemia (8.6% and 14.5%), lymphopenia (12.5% and 1.8%), 
leukopenia (11.7% and 3.6%), and hyperglycaemia (10.9% in both groups). 
Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported in 58 (45.3%) and 23 (41.8%) patients of the pooled E-Pd and Pd 
groups, respectively; the most common Grade 3-4 event was neutropenia (pooled E-Pd: 13.3% and Pd: 
18.2%). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Infusion-related Reactions 
Infusion related reactions (IRRs), a known toxicity, were defined based on investigator assessment of events 
occurring  on  the  day  of  or  the  day  after  elotuzumab  infusion.  All  patients  who  had  an  IRR  were  able  to 
continue  elotuzumab  infusions  without  a  recurrence  of  the  IRR.    Overall  8  (6.3%)  patients  (2  patients

CA204125 and 5 patients in CA204142) in the pooled E-Pd group experienced an IRR.  The IRR included, 
chest discomfort, hypertension, headache and nausea, cough and throat irritation, chills and increased back 
pain, dyspnoea and chills. All IRRs were Grade 1/2 and  manageable by infusion interrupted with or without 
administering  systemic  anti  histamine,  steroid  and/or  medicine  to  treated  the  symptoms.  No  patients 
discontinued study therapy due to an IRR in the pooled E-Pd group. 
Second Primary Malignancy 
There were 2 SPM events that met the criteria for SPM, but were not reported as such in the eCRF in the 
pooled E-Pd group: 1 clear cell renal cell carcinoma and 1 squamous cell carcinoma (CA204142). One SPM 
(invasive breast carcinoma) was reported in the Pd group.  
Infections 
AEs of infection (any grade) were reported in similar proportions of patients in both treatment group; 67.2% 
and 65.5% of the pooled E-Pd and Pd groups, respectively. Grade 3-4 AEs of infection were reported in 
25.0% and 21.8% of patients in the pooled E-Pd and Pd groups, respectively. The most frequent (≥5%) was 
pneumonia (pooled E-Pd: 13.3% and Pd: 9.1%).  
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of infection were  lower in the pooled E-Pd  group compared to the Pd 
group (195.5 and 230.3/100 P-Y). The only common exposure-adjusted incidence rate of infection (> 5 per 
100 P-Y) that was reported at a more than two-fold greater proportion in the pooled E-Pd group vs the Pd 
group included cellulitis. Conversely, rates of infection reported at a more than two-fold greater proportion 
in the Pd group vs the pooled E-Pd group included bronchitis, influenza, oral herpes, oral candidiasis, septic 
shock, rhinitis, and skin infection. 
In  study  CA204125  additional  analyses  with  regard  to  infections  were  conducted.  Overall  the  profile  of 
infections  appeared  similar  between  treatment  groups  in  CA204125.    The  median  time  to  first  infection 
(E-Pd: 1.71 months, Pd: 1.58 months) and median duration of first infection (10 days in both groups) were 
similar between treatment groups. 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  opportunistic  infections  was  similar  between  the  E-Pd  and  Pd  treatment 
groups (E-Pd: 8.3%, Pd: 9.1%). All opportunistic infections were Grade 1-2 and no patients discontinued 
treatment due to an opportunistic infection. 
Rates of ‘herpes zoster’ were numerically higher in the E-Pd group compared to the Pd group (5.0% and 
1.8%), respectively. 
Rates of fungal infections, specifically ‘oral candidiasis’ were numerically higher in the Pd group compared to 
the E-Pd group (5.5% and 0%), respectively. 
The median absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) at time of first infection was similar in the treatment groups 
(E-Pd: 0.6695 10^9/L, Pd: 0.8655 10^9/L). 
The  frequency  of  infections  was  similar  between  treatment  groups  regardless  of  patient’s  stem  cell 
transplant  (SCT)  status  (no  SCT  or  yes  SCT).  The  proportion  of  patients  with  infections  with  prior  SCT 
included: E-Pd, 74.2% and Pd, 71.9%; infections in patients without prior SCT included: E-Pd, 55.2% and 
Pd, 56.5%. Most patients reported lymphopenia (any Grade) in both treatment groups regardless of SCT 
status. Grade 3/4 lymphopenia was higher in the E-Pd group (no SCT: 65.5%, yes SCT: 74.2%) compared 
to the Pd group (no SCT: 30.4%, yes SCT: 38.7%), regardless of prior SCT status.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Analyses  of  SAEs  were  conducted  for  events  reported  during  study  treatment  and  up  to  60  days  after 
treatment discontinuation. SAEs (regardless of relationship) of any grade occurred at similar frequency in 
both treatment groups (pooled E-Pd: 65 [50.8%] patients and Pd: 30 [54.5%] patients).  
The only frequently (> 5%) reported SAE (any grade, regardless of causality) in the pooled E-Pd and Pd 
groups, was pneumonia (14.1% and 9.1%). Pneumonia was reported in 3 (5.0%) subjects in CA204125 (all 
were Grade 3-4) and 15 (22.1%) subjects in CA204142 (all were Grade 3-5). 
Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 42 (32.8%) subjects in the pooled E-Pd group and 19 (34.5%) patients in 
the Pd group. The only frequently (> 5%) reported Grade 3-4 event was pneumonia (13.3% and 7.3%; for 
respectively the E-Pd and Pd group). 
Grade 5 SAEs were reported in 12 (9.4%) patients and 8 (14.5%) patients in the pooled E-Pd and Pd groups, 
respectively; none of these events were frequently reported (> 5%). 
SAEs of infection (any grade) were reported in 41 (32.0%) and 15 (27.3%) subjects in the pooled E-Pd and 
Pd  groups,  respectively.  Grade  3-4  SAEs  of  infection  were  reported  in  29  (22.7%)  and  11  (20.0%), 
respectively. 
Drug-related SAEs (any grade; considered related to study drug by the investigator) were reported in 27 
(21.1%) and 9 (16.4%) patients of the pooled E-Pd and Pd groups, respectively. Grade 3-4 drug-related 
SAEs were reported in 23 (18.0%) and 6 (10.9%) patients, respectively.

The total number of deaths was 34 (26.6%) patients in the pooled E-Pd group and 18 (32.7%) patients in 
the Pd group. 
Disease progression was the primary cause of death in 18/34 patients in the pooled E-Pd group and 14/18 
patients in the Pd group. 
Deaths occurring within 60 days of last dose included 13 (10.2%) patients in the pooled E-Pd group and 7 
(12.7%) in the Pd group.  
None of the deaths were considered related to drug toxicity in either treatment group.  
Table 15 Summary of Deaths-All Treated Patients 
An assessment of deaths within 60 days of the last study drug dose by age subgroups was performed. Of the 
patients < 65 years of age, 5 (10.2%) in the pooled E-Pd and 2 (9.5%) in Pd group died.  Of the patients ≥65 
years and < 75 years, 4 (6.8%) in the pooled E-Pd and 3 (13.6%) in the Pd group died. Of the patients ≥75 
years 3 (16.7%) in the E-Pd and 2 (16.7%) in the Pd group died.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Baseline haematologic laboratory test results of any grade were similar between treatment groups.  
The  highest  Grade  3-4  haematologic  abnormalities  were  lymphopenia  (pooled  E-Pd  [75.0%]  and  Pd 
[35.2%]), neutropenia (pooled E-Pd [37.5%] and Pd [61.1%]), and leukopenia (pooled E-Pd [46.0%] and 
Pd [35.2%]). 
Despite  more  Grade  3-4  lymphopenia  in  the  E-Pd  group,  this  did  not  translate  into  a  higher  exposure 
adjusted, incidence rate of infections reported as an AE (195.0 and 230.3 /100 P-Y in the pooled E-Pd and Pd 
groups, respectively). 
Lymphocyte count reduction occurred early in the study in both treatment groups and stabilized throughout 
the study.

Chemistry 
There  was  no  clinically  meaningful  difference  between  results  of  chemistry  laboratory  tests  for  the  two 
treatment groups.  
Frequencies of Grade 3-4 chemistry laboratory abnormalities were low and were similar in both treatment 
groups.

where Pooled E-Pd was at least 10% and at least 5% Higher than the Pd Group- All 
treated patients 
Liver function 
There was no clinically meaningful difference between groups in results from hepatic function tests. Most 
liver function tests were Grade 1-2 and the results were balanced between the treatment groups, except 
Grade  1-2  AST  (pooled  E-Pd:  14.4%  and  Pd:  7.5%).  Among  the  patients  with  at  least  1  ALT  or  AST 
assessment none- fulfilled criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury (pDILI) cases (AST/ALT >3ULN and 
total bilirubin [Tbi] >2ULN and APL <2 ULN). 
Renal function 
Renal insufficiency is a manifestation of MM. Entry criteria allowed for patients with creatinine clearance of 
>45  mL/min  in  CA204125  and  >30  mL/min  in  CA204142  to  enter  the  study.  Baseline  values  for  serum 
creatinine and creatinine clearance were similar in E-Pd and Pd group. 
A greater proportion of patients reported Grade 3 toxicities for creatinine in the Pd group (pooled E-Pd; 0 vs 
Pd: 7.5%), which may be reflective of myeloma-related renal function impairment (ie, poor disease control). 
Safety in special populations 
There were no evidence of clinically meaningful differences in the safety profile by age, race, or gender. 
Numeric  differences  were  observed  among  subgroups,  however  in  general  frequencies  of  AEs  were 
comparable between treatment groups for age gender and race groups.  
With regard to age, only for gastrointestinal disorders the incidence was consistently higher with higher age 
(46.9%  for  patients  <65  years,  55.9%  ≥65  and  <75  years  and  66.7%  for  ≥75  and  <85  years). 
Furthermore, more patients in the oldest age group (≥75 and <85  years) experienced an AE leading to

discontinuation (27.8% vs 6.1% in patients below 65 years and 23.7% in patients between 65 and 75 years 
of age). 
ISS stage and ECOG Performance Status 
Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  for  ISS  (International  Staging  System)  stage  and  ECOG  (Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the 
safety profile between subgroups. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal PK DDI studies have been conducted with elotuzumab. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
As of the 21-Feb-2018 clinical database lock for CA204125 and the 04-April-2018 for CA204142, 71.1% of 
the patients in the pooled E-Pd group and 80.0% of the patients in the Pd group had discontinued study 
therapy.   
The overall frequencies of all-causality AEs leading to discontinuation were similar between the pooled E-Pd 
group (22 patients [17.2%] and Pd group (13 patients [23.6%]).  
Grade 3-4 AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in similar proportion of patients in both treatment 
groups (9.4% in the pooled E-Pd group and 10.9% in the Pd group). 
Drug-related any-Grade AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 14 (10.9%) of the patients in the 
pooled E-Pd group and 3 (5.5%) of the patients in the Pd group. Drug related Grade 3-4 AEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported in greater proportions of patients in the pooled E-Pd (7.8%) compared to Pd 
group (1.8%).  
Other AEs leading to discontinuation occurring more frequently in the CA204125 and pooled E-Pd group 
were neutropenia (0 and 2.3% vs 0), tremor (1.7% and 1.6% vs 0), and nausea (0 and 1.6% vs 0).  
Infections  led  to  discontinuation  of  3.9%  and  5.5%  of  the  patients  in  the  pooled  E-Pd  and  Pd  groups, 
respectively. There was no difference between treatment groups in the grade or type of infections leading to 
discontinuation.  
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders led to discontinuation in 3.9% and 0 of the patients in the 
pooled E-Pd and Pd groups. Also more patients in the E-Pd than in the Pd group, discontinued treatment due 
to AEs belonging to the blood and lymphatic system disorders (2.3% vs 0%), nervous system disorders 
(2.3%  vs  0),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (1.6%  vs  0)  and  vascular  disorders  (1.6%  vs  0).  However  the 
number of patients discontinuing treatment due to these AEs was small (2 or 3 in total). 
SPM led to discontinuation in 1 (1.8%) patients in the Pd group (Grade 3-4 invasive breast carcinoma); no 
patients in the pooled E-Pd group had an SPM that led to discontinuation. 
Neoplasms  led  to  discontinuation  in  4  (7.3%)  of  the  patients  in  the  Pd  group  (Grade  3-4  plasma  cell 
leukaemia, and 2 Grade 5 malignant neoplasm progression).

Table 17 Reasons for discontinuation of study treatment-all-treated patients 
Immunogenicity 
The  immunogenicity  was  assessed  in  Study  CA204125.  Of  the  53  elotuzumab-treated  patients  who  had 
evaluable ADA data at baseline and post-baseline. Five (5; 9.4%) patients were ADA positive at baseline; 
only 1 patient had ADAs detected post-dose.  
Nineteen (19; 35.8%) of the patients had positive immunogenicity samples on 1 or more occasions following 
administration of elotuzumab. Thirty-four (34; 64.2%) patients were ADA negative. 
Of the 3 patients who had at least one ADA positive sample with Nabs detected, only one patient exhibited 
persistent positive anti-drug antibodies which did not appear to correlate to safety or efficacy.   
Post marketing experience 
Elotuzumab was first approved on 30 November 2015 in the US for the use in multiple myeloma and has 
since been approved across multiple countries, including the EU.  
The  post-marketing  safety  profile  of  elotuzumab  in  the  real-world  setting  is  similar  to  the  safety  profile 
established during clinical trials.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data of elotuzumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (E-Pd) in patients 
with multiple myeloma who have received at least 2 prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome 
inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy, have been assessed from a total 
of 128 patients, who were treated in two different studies (CA204125 and CA204142). Study CA204125 
included a control arm in which 55 patients received only pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd). Based on 
both studies’ inclusion/exclusion criteria and baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the 
enrolled patients, the population included in study CA204142 appeared to be at an earlier stage of disease 
with less previously treated (1-2 prior lines of therapy) compared to the patient population of study 
CA204125 (≥2 lines of therapy, median of 3 prior therapies); the latter better reflects the characteristics of 
a RRMM population and the new claimed indication.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/534722/2019 
Page 63/73 
 
  
  
 
Overall, the safety dataset can be considered acceptable, however it should be taken into account that both 
CA204125 and CA204142 studies are open-label and, in addition, study CA204142 is also uncontrolled. This 
makes the assessment of drug relationship by the investigator biased and not fully reliable, leading to a 
potential underestimation of the treatment-related TEAEs. Nevertheless, the pooled data have a control 
group, because they compare the pooled data from the E-Pd groups of both studies to the data from the Pd 
control group of study CA204125 only.   
In study CA204142, the dosing information for oral medications was incorrectly entered by some research 
staff,  which  caused  the  calculated  dose  intensity  to  be  underestimated  for  pomalidomide  and 
dexamethasone. This will be corrected in the final CSR. This is acceptable. 
The most common AEs (any grade) included anaemia (23.4% vs 36.4%, for respectively E-Pd vs Pd groups), 
neutropenia  (29.7%  vs  30.9%),  diarrhoea  (26.6%  vs  9.1%),  pyrexia  (13.3%  vs  25.5%),  constipation 
(23.4% vs 10/9%) and upper respiratory tract infection (23.4% vs 14.5%).   
The AEs reported more frequently in patients treated with E-Pd than in patients treated with Pd included 
fatigue (35,9% and 16.4%), diarrhoea (26.6% vs 9.1%), constipation (23.4% vs 10.9%), muscle spasm 
(19.5%  vs  5.5%),  dyspnoea  (19.5%  vs  7.3%),  cough  (19.5%  vs  9.1%),  peripheral  oedema  (17.2%  vs 
7.3%), back pain (14.8% vs 7.3%), lymphopenia (13.3% vs 1.8%), leukopenia (12.5% vs 5.5%), tremor 
(7.8% vs 3.6%), headache (10.2% vs 3.6%), anxiety (7.0% vs 1.8%), dehydration (6.3% vs 1.8%) and 
vomiting (5.5% vs 1.8%).  
There is an apparent discrepancy in the frequency of some of the reported adverse events between Study 
CA204125 and Study CA204142. This difference has no impact on the overall assessment of elotuzumab 
safety, as the nature and the frequency of adverse events reported in the pooled E-Pd safety population is 
consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  elotuzumab  in  patients  treated  with  lenalidomide  and 
dexamethasone (Study CA204004). 
An example of a large difference in the frequency of reported events between the two studies in patients 
treated in the E-Pd groups is fatigue, which was reported in 35.9% of subjects in the pooled E-Pd group 
(most events were Grade 1 or 2). Comparatively, in Study CA204004, a prospectively randomized clinical 
trial  comparing elotuzumab  administration  with  lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone  (E-Ld)  to  lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone (Ld) alone, fatigue was reported in 46.9% of patients (149/318) exposed to E-Ld. The 
current version of the SmPC lists fatigue as an adverse drug reaction with “very common” overall frequency. 
Diarrhoea was also reported more frequently in CA204142 than CA204125. This AE occurred in 26.6% of 
patients in the pooled E-Pd population. Previously diarrhoea was reported for 46.9% of the patients treated 
with E-Ld in study CA204004. As with fatigue, diarrhoea is a “very” common” adverse drug reaction in the 
current version of the SmPC. 
The  reported  AEs  for  E-Pd  were  similar  with  the  AE’s  reported  for  the  registration  study  with  E-Ld 
(CA204004). It needs to be mentioned that although reported in the AE table for study CA204004, some are 
not  included  in  the  SmPC,  like  for  instance  neutropenia,  dyspnoea,  peripheral  oedema,  back  pain, 
leukopenia, tremor and vomiting. As the median duration of treatment for patients in the E-Pd group was 
longer  than  for  the  patients  in  the  Pd  group  in  study  CA204125,  the  applicant  calculated  the 
exposure-adjusted incidence of AEs. As a result, from the most commonly occurring AEs only fatigue, upper 
respiratory tract infection, leukopenia, diarrhoea and cough, were more frequently reported for the E-Pd 
group than for the Pd group.  
Some  AEs  that  were  reported  in  the  pivotal  CA204004  study  were  not  seen  in  studies  CA204125  or 
CA204142. For instance, peripheral neuropathy was reported in 16.2% of the patients treated with pooled 
E-Ld groups in comparison to 8.2% in the Ld control arm, where none of the patients in study CA204125 or 
CA204142 experienced this AE. Also, deep vein thromboses was reported in 7.2% of the patients treated 
with pooled E-Ld group in comparison to 3.8% in patients treated with Ld in study CA204004. None of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/534722/2019 
Page 64/73 
 
  
  
 
patients in study CA204125 or CA204142 had a deep vein thrombosis. Already in the registration study the 
incidence of deep vein thrombosis for patients who received prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin 
and patients who were given vitamin K antagonists was decreased (or even zero for patients given vitamin 
K antagonist) in comparison to those who did not receive any prophylactic therapy.  
SAEs  (regardless  of  relationship)  of  any  grade  occurred  at  similar  frequency  in  both  treatment  groups 
(pooled E-Pd: 65 [50.8%] patients and Pd: 30 [54.5%] patients), which is similar to the incidence of Grade 
3-4 SAEs reported for study CA204004. The most frequent SAEs included infection of which the incidence of 
pneumonia  (14.1%  and  9.1%,  for  respectively  patients  treated  with  E-Pd  and  Pd)  was  the  highest.  The 
duration of first infection was 10 days in both treatment groups. 
Infections and especially pneumonia are very common AEs of elotuzumab, the incidence reported in the 
current studies are in line with the known risk on infections and pneumonia. Herpes zoster occurred more 
frequently in the E-Pd group than in the Pd group (5% vs 1.8%).  
Frequencies of all-causality AEs leading to discontinuation were similar in the CA204125 and pooled E-Pd 
group compared with the Pd group (18.3% and 17.2% vs 23.6%).  
Drug related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported more frequently in the E-Pd group than in the Pd 
group (7.8% vs 1.8%, respectively). The most commonly reported AEs leading to discontinuation included 
Neoplasms,  Infections,  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders,  Blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders. 
Infections  led  to  discontinuation  in  3.9%  and  5.5%  of  patients  in  the  pooled  E-Pd  and  Pd  groups, 
respectively, with no difference by Grade of AEs between the two treatment groups.  
The total number of deaths was 34 (26.6%) patients in the pooled E-Pd group and 18 (32.7%) patients in 
the Pd group. More patients died in study CA204142 than in study CA204125 (21 [30.9%] vs 13 [21.7%] 
subjects), despite the fact that for study CA204142 compared with study CA204125, patients at an earlier 
stage of disease and with less lines of previous treatment were enrolled. 
Disease progression was the primary cause of death in 18/34 patients in the pooled E-Pd group and 14/18 
patients in the Pd group.  
None of the patients died by drug toxicity, however grade 5 AEs were reported for 12 (9.4%) of the patients 
in the E-Pd group and 8 (14.5%) of the patients in the Pd group.   
At least the infections leading to death might be considered as drug-related. The incidence of death due to 
infections was similar in both treatment groups; 5 (3.9%) patients in the E-Pd group and 2 (3.6%) of the 
patients in the patients in the Pd group. A difference in the frequency of infections as cause of death was 
seen  between  the  two  studies  (1  [1.7%]  subject  in  study  CA204125  vs  4  [5.9%]  subjects  in  study 
CA204142).  
In total the percentages of patients who died due to infections were slightly higher in the current studies  
than what was reported in study CA204004, however the total numbers are small.  
Another cause of death that was relatively high was cardiovascular disease, also for this the incidence of 
death within the E-Pd group was similar to the incidence of death within the Pd group (3.9 % vs 3.6%, 
respectively).  
Chemistry laboratory test results showed a higher incidence of the following any Grade AEs in the E-Pd group 
compared with the Pd group. Also liver function test abnormalities were reported more frequently for the 
E-Pd group (14.4% vs 7.5%). The percentage of patients with creatinine increase lower in pooled E-Pd group 
than in the Pd group (31.7% vs 41.5%). In the Pd group also more patients had grade 3 AEs related to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/534722/2019 
Page 65/73 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
creatinine compared with the E-Pd treated patients (7.5% vs 0). This may be due to a poorer disease control 
in  the  Pd  group.  Data  on  the  drug-related  and/or  clinically  significant  hematologic  and  chemistry 
abnormalities and exposure-adjusted frequencies have been provided.  
Differences in AE incidences by age and sex were observed, however there was no clear trend toward a 
worse safety profile with increasing age or sex.  
Some numeric differences were observed by region (North America, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World) in 
terms  of  Grade  3-4  AEs  (60.6%,  52.3%,  69.2%,  respectively),  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  (16.9%, 
20.5%, 7.7%), any Grade SAEs (50.7%, 59.1%, 23.1%), and Grade 3-4 SAEs (36.6%, 29.5%, 23.1%).  
Similarly, in the subgroup analysis by prior lines of therapy (1 vs 2-3 vs ≥4), the incidence of some AEs was 
higher in one or more of these subgroups without a specific trend, in terms of Grade 3-4 AEs (63%, 56.2%, 
60.7%,  respectively),  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  (11.1,  16.4%,  25%),  Grade  3-4  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation  (11.1,  8.2%,  10.7%),  any  Grade  SAEs  (59.3%,  50.7%,  42.9%),  and  Grade  3-4  SAEs 
(40.7%, 31.5%, 28.6%). Infections seem to occur more frequently in patients with fewer treatment lines. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Considering the submitted safety data, the safety profile of elotuzumab when administered in combination 
with pomalidomide and dexamethasone is better or comparable with the known safety profile of elotuzumab 
in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, except for leukopenia, which was therefore added as 
ADR to the PI.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have 
been updated.  
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for several 
local representatives. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  The  readability  of  the  PL  (QRD  template  Version  9.0)  of  Empliciti  (elotuzumab),  in  English,  was 
assessed during the assessment of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) according 
to  the  methods  outlined  in  the  European  Commission’s  guideline  titled:  A  guideline  on  the 
readability  of  the  label  and  package  leaflet  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use,  Revision  1,  12 
January 2009. The final report was then submitted to the EMA on 03 July 2015 as part of the initial 
MAA dossier (EMEA/H/C/3967, MAA approved on 11 May 2016). 
•  The new indication that is hereby applied for concerns the same route of administration and has a 
similar  safety  profile  as  the  previously  approved  indications  (i.e.,  key  safety  messages  for  the 
existing and new applied for indication are essentially the same).  
•  Administration of Empliciti (elotuzumab) is done by a health care professional. The posology change 
hereby  applied  for  concerns  the  same  route  of  administration  and  anticipates  no  impact  on  the 
safety  profile  of  elotuzumab  relative  to  the  current  dosing  schedule.  The  instructions  for  dose 
calculation,  preparation,  and  administration,  have  been  updated  for  the  change  in  posology.  In 
addition, some minor editorial updates are being proposed to further improve the readability. 
•  The general design and layout of the proposed PL have not changed compared to the tested one. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Empliciti (elotuzumab) was included in the 
additional monitoring list at the time of the initial registration as it contains a new active substance which, on 
1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
MM is the second most common haematological malignancy, which causes significant morbidity and remains 
a fatal disease. Despite the substantial improvement in response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) 
from current treatment options, nearly all patients with MM will relapse.  
In this application, the indication for elotuzumab (Empliciti) is extended to include the treatment of patients 
relapsed  and  refractory  multiple  myeloma  who  have  received  at  least  two  prior  therapies  including 
lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.  
The definition refractory and relapsed multiple myeloma (RRMM) used in the pivotal study is patients with 
MM who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI) 
and had disease progression on or within 60 days of their last therapy. Patients were refractory if they had 
progressed on or within 60 days of treatment with lenalidomide and a PI and on or within 60 days of their 
last  treatment,  or  relapsed  and  refractory  if  they  had  achieved  at  least  a  partial  response  to  previous 
treatment  with  lenalidomide  and  a  PI  but  progressed  within  6 months  and  had  developed  progressive 
disease on or within 60 days after completing their last treatment. 
This definition of RRMM differs from the IMWG consensus definition (i.e. patients that are nonresponsive 
while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy, have achieved minimal response or 
better at some point previously and then progressed in their disease course). The definition used in the study 
has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The target population of the claimed indication is representative of an advanced disease setting. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently  approved  treatments  in  the  EU  for  relapsed/refractory  MM  (r/r  MM)  include  bortezomib  and 
lenalidomide,  both  in  combination  with  dexamethasone  (Vd  and  Rd,  respectively),  second-generation  PI 
based therapies (i.e. carfilzomib, either in combination with dexamethasone [Kd] or Rd [KRd], and ixazomib 
in combination with Rd [IRd]), the third-generation IMiD pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone 
(Pd), the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat in combination with Vd, and the monoclonal antibodies 
elotuzumab (in combination with Rd [ERd]) and daratumumab (in combination either with Vd [DVd] and Rd 
[DRd] or in monotherapy). Combination regimens have improved the rate of complete response (CR) and 
prolonged PFS and OS in the r/r setting. Response rates between 30-60%, median PFS of 4 up to 9 months 
and median OS of 12 up to >24 months have been reported in the literature. It is recognised that usually 
quality  and  duration  of  response  becomes  progressively  shorter  with  each  successive  regimen,  in  other 
words more pre-treated patients usually achieve lower rate of response and of progressively short duration. 
Despite  the  recent  improvements  with  availability  of  different  treatment  options,  (RR)MM  remains  an 
incurable disease and the cause of about 20% of all deaths from hematologic malignancy and 2% of deaths 
from all cancers. Therefore, an unmet medical need for this condition is recognized. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The evidence of efficacy of elotuzumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients 
with MM is based on the results of one pivotal phase II study (CA204125), supported by the data of the E-Pd 
arm of the phase II CA204142 study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/534722/2019 
Page 69/73 
 
  
  
Study CA204125 was a phase II, multicenter, multinational, randomized (1:1), open label study. A total of 
117 patients with RRMM previously treated with at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a 
proteasome inhibitor and with disease progression on the last therapy, were randomized (1:1) to receive 
E-Pd  or  Pd.  Primary  endpoint  was  PFS  according  to  INV  assessment  in  the  ITT  sample.  Key  secondary 
endpoints  were  ORR  (according  to  INV)  and  OS.  Quality  of  life,  DoR  and  MRD  status  were  evaluated  as 
exploratory endpoints. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The results of the primary PFS analysis of the pivotal CA204125 study based on 75 (64%, cut-off 21 Feb 
2018) events showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS for E-Pd compared with Pd (HR 0.54, 
95% CI 0.34-0.86, p=0.0078), with a gain in median PFS of 5.6 months in favour of E-Pd (median PFS 10.25 
vs 4.67 months, respectively). Results were consistent with several sensitivity analyses performed and also 
with a post-hoc analysis performed according to a blinded independent committee. 
Regarding the secondary endpoints, consistency was observed in terms of ORR according to INV (53.3% vs 
26.3% with E-Pd and Pd, respectively, with VGPR or better: 20% vs 8.8%, respectively) as well as post-hoc 
according to IRC (concordance rate >85%). Although formal conclusion is hampered by the limited number 
of patients, subgroup analyses regarding PFS by best response to previous therapy and by refractoriness to 
lenalidomide, PI inhibitors of both appears to be in line with the primary analysis. 
The original immature OS analysis (26.9% of events, HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.30-1.28, median OS not reached 
in both arms, minimum follow up of 9.1 months) has been updated with the recently proposed descriptive 
analysis performed after a minimum follow up of 18.3 months (cut-off date 29 November 2018). At that time 
a total of 48 death events were observed, representing 41% of the patients randomized and 61% of the 
requested  OS  events  for  the  planned  final  analysis  (projected  to  be  conducted  in  December  2020).  The 
results suggest an OS improvement with E-Pd compared with Pd (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.30 - 0.96, median 
OS NR in the E-Pd arm and 17.4 months in the PD arm). Of note, the 95%-CI are formally descriptive (as not 
backed up by pre-planned testing at a significance level of 0.05). 
Evaluation of quality of life did not show any significant difference between the two study arms overtime 
regarding the domains analysed, indicating no detrimental effect but also no improvement by addition of 
elotuzumab to Pd. Results should be taken with caution due to the open-label design of the trial. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There  is  some  uncertainty  about  the  association  between  E-Pd  and  the  effect  on  OS  due  to  possible 
imbalance  in  post-progression  treatments.  This  issue,  together  with  unbalances  observed  in  the  triplet 
therapies received pre-study, will be discussed by the Applicant post-approval at the time final OS results 
will be presented. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety database in support of the proposed E-Pd combination regimen consists of a total of 128 patients 
treated in two different studies (CA204125 and CA204142).  
The most common AEs (any grade) included anaemia (23.4% vs 36.4%, for respectively E-Pd vs Pd groups), 
neutropenia  (29.7%  vs  30.9%),  diarrhoea  (26.6%  vs  9.1%),  pyrexia  (13.3%  vs  25.5%),  constipation 
(23.4% vs 10/9%) and upper respiratory tract infection (23.4% vs 14.5%).   
The AEs reported more frequently in patients treated with E-Pd than in patients treated with Pd included;  
fatigue (35.9% and 16.4%), diarrhoea (26.6% vs 9.1%) constipation (23.4% vs 10.9%), muscle spasm 
(19.5%  vs  5.5%),  dyspnoea  (19.5%  vs  7.3%),  cough  (19.5%  vs  9.1%),  peripheral  oedema  (17.2%  vs 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/534722/2019 
Page 70/73 
 
  
  
7.3%), back pain (14.8% vs 7.3%), lymphopenia (13.3% vs 1.8%), leukopenia (12.5% vs 5.5%), tremor 
(7.8% vs 3.6%), headache (10.2% vs 3.6%), anxiety (7.0% vs 1.8%), dehydration (6.3% vs 1.8%)  and 
vomiting (5.5% vs 1.8%).  
As the median duration of treatment for patients in the E-Pd group was longer than for the patients in the Pd 
group, the applicant calculated the exposure-adjusted incidence of AEs. From the most commonly occurring 
AEs only fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, leukopenia, diarrhoea and cough, were more frequently 
reported for the E-Pd group than for the PD group. SAEs (regardless of relationship) of any grade occurred 
at  similar  frequency  in  both  treatment  groups  (pooled  E-Pd:  65  [50.8%]  patients  and  Pd:  30  [54.5%] 
patients). The most frequently SAEs included infection of which the incidence of pneumonia (14.1% and 
9.1%, for respectively patients treated with E-Pd and Pd) was the highest. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Uncertainties in the safety assessment of elotuzumab for this extension of indication are related to the fact 
that  both  CA204125  and  CA204142  studies  are  open-label  and,  in  addition,  study  CA204142  is  also 
uncontrolled. This may lead to a potential underestimation of the treatment-related TEAEs, despite the fact 
that pooled data may be compared to those from the Pd control group of study CA204125.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Delaying disease progression with at least no detriment in survival associated with acceptable toxicity 
represent conventional outcome measures of patient benefit.  
The benefits of elotuzumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the new proposed 
indication  are  essentially  based  on  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  PFS 
(median PFS gain of 5.6 months). The effect is convincing and supported by a consistent improvement in 
ORR  as  well  as  apparently  OS  (preliminary  analysis  based  on  61%  of  requested  events).  The  apparent 
association between E-Pd and OS will have to be confirmed using longer follow-up and addressing possible 
imbalances in prognostic factors and post-progression treatments.  Evaluation of quality of life indicates no 
detrimental effect but also no improvements by addition of elotuzumab to Pd. Reliability of quality of life data 
is challenged by the open-label design of the study. Evaluation of safety indicates a substantial toxicity, 
however  mostly  less  or  comparable  to  the  already  known  one  of  elotuzumab,  with  infections, 
gastrointestinal and bone marrow the most frequently reported adverse reactions and leukopenia appearing 
as new ADR. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  results  of  the  pivotal  CA204125  trial  are  considered  of  clinical  relevance.  The  magnitude  of  the 
improvement in median PFS (around 5.6 months), is considered clinically meaningful.  
The  description  of  the  key  ADRs  in  the  PI  and  the  inclusion  of  the  key  risks  in  the  RMP  address  them 
adequately. Overall the benefits outweigh the risks in the applied indication. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP recommends the following post-authorisation provisions: 
1. 
Final OS results from study CA204125 should be provided, with detailed information on post-study 
therapies received by patients. 
2. 
Additional OS analyses should be provided to evaluate the impact of the observed unbalances in the 
type of prior triplet therapies (e.g. VRD and carfilzomib-containing triple regimens) on the observed OS 
results, also considering the differences in subsequent treatments. 
3. 
Data on MRD and other exploratory biomarker analyses (at the time of final OS results of CA204125 
study) should be provided. 
4. 
Correct data for dose intensity from study CA204142 should be provided (see Discussion on clinical 
safety). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The  overall  B/R  of  elotuzumab  in  combination  with  pomalidomide  and  dexamethasone  is  considered 
positive. 
4.  Recommendations

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Following the CHMP assessment of all data provided, the agreed indication for Zokinvy is: 
‘ZOKINVY is indicated for the treatment of patients 12 months of age and older with a genetically 
confirmed diagnosis of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome or a processing-deficient Progeroid 
Laminopathy associated with either a heterozygous LMNA mutation with progerin-like protein 
accumulation or a homozygous or compound heterozygous ZMPSTE24 mutation.’ 
Related conditions 
Classic and non-classic progeria 
Classical HGPS is usually caused by a sporadic autosomal dominant mutation (except unique inheritable 
variety such as Werner's syndrome). The bi-allelic mutation results in an accumulation of progerin. 
Non-classical  HGPS  follows  an  autosomal  recessive  pattern  of  inheritance  (Hennekam,  2006).  Non-
classic  HPGS  overlap  with  patients  with  mandibuloacral  dysostosis  (MAD).  Other  LMNA-dominant 
mutations have been associated with the production of progerin or other deleted prelamin A isoforms 
(e.g. prelamin AΔ35 and prelamin AΔ90) (Barthelemy et al., 2015).  
Progeroid laminopathies (PL) are genetically related to HGPS and have clinical features that overlap 
with HGPS, including severe cardiovascular disease. 
Figure 1 displays different mutations for classic, non-classic HGPS, and progeroid laminopathy.

Page 10/140 
 
 
 
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare multi-systemic “premature aging” disease in 
which most children die of the complications of severe atherosclerosis at an average age of 14.5 years 
(Gordon et al., 2018). Hennekam (2006) reported mean survival of classic HGPS is 12.4 (1.5 – 27) 
years while deBusk (1972) reported a median age of death at 13.4 (7 – 27.5 years).  
The incidence of HGPS is approximately 1 in 4 million births (Hennekam, 2006) with a prevalence of 1 
in 20 million living individuals (Gordon et al., 2018). Progeroid laminopathies, which are rarer than 
HGPS, are genetically related to HGPS and have clinical features that overlap with HGPS including 
severe cardiovascular disease. As of October 2021, 133 children with the classic HPGS phenotype and 
63 children with progeroid laminopathies (who have a mutation in the Lamin pathway but do not 
produce progerin) are known to be alive1.  
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Patients affected with typical or classic HGPS carry a heterozygous, recurrent de novo mutation in exon 
11 (c.1824C4T; p.Gly608Gly) of chromosome 1 (q21-q23), leading to the activation of a cryptic splice 
site and the in-frame deletion of its last 150 bp in pre-mRNAs specifically encoding prelamin A. Due to 
the in-frame deletion, the Zmpste24 cleavage site is completely absent. The truncated transcript is 
translated into a 50 amino acid-deleted prelamin A precursor, also called progerin or lamin AΔ50, 
which cannot undergo all the physiological post-translational processing steps leading to mature lamin 
A and accumulates in cell nuclei in a permanently farnesylated state (Barthelemy et al., 2015). Lamin 
A plays a critical role in nuclear envelope integrity, chromosome organisation, DNA replication and 
gene transcription. Thus, unlike lamin A, progerin retains the farnesyl group, which is key to its ability 
to associate with the inner nuclear membrane and cause cellular damage via structural instability 
(Goldman et al., 2004; Cao et al., 2007). This accumulation of progerin is thought to be responsible for 
the clinical manifestations of the disease (Kieran et al., 2014).  
The current knowledge of HGPS is highly empirical and consists of numerous observations without a 
clear conjunctive theory. Progerin is particularly toxic to vascular smooth muscle cells and results in 
the accelerated arteriosclerosis characteristic of HGPS. In HGPS, cardiovascular complications due to 
atherosclerosis lead to early death in HGPS patients.  
Progeroid laminopathies are caused by mutations in LMNA or proteins affecting the post-
translational pathway of LMNA such as Zmpste24 cleavage site that result in progerin-like proteins 
(Gordon et al., 2019). These farnesylated abnormal progerin-like proteins cause cellular damage as 
described above. These diseases are rarer than HGPS and more heterogeneous making them even 
more challenging to study the effects of pharmacological interventions.  
PLs can be grouped into two classes: 1) processing-deficient in which a farnesylated prelamin A protein 
accumulates, as it does in HGPS; and 2) processing-proficient (sometimes called “atypical” progerias) 
resulting from mutations that do not lead to accumulation of farnesylated prelamin A proteins. 
Retention of the farnesyl group allows these abnormal proteins to associate with the inner nuclear 
membrane and cause cellular damage via structural instability and functional abnormalities (Cao, 
Capell, Erdos, Djabali, & Collins, 2007; Goldman et al., 2004).

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Besides genetic diagnosis, diagnosis of HGPS is based on recognition of a consistent pattern of clinical 
features, including severe failure to thrive, characteristic facial features (receding mandible, narrow 
nasal bridge and pointed nasal tip), total alopecia, global lipodystrophy, joint contractures, skeletal 
dysplasia, sclerodermatous skin, dental abnormalities, low-frequency conductive hearing loss, and 
premature progressive atherosclerosis; see Figure 1 (Gordon, Brown, & Collins, 2019; Merideth et al., 
2008). Death in children with HGPS occurs as a result of complications of severe atherosclerosis. 
As in other forms of progressive cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke, angina, cardiomegaly, 
and congestive heart failure are often end-stage events. Impaired vascular compliance has been 
postulated to comprise a major component of the vascular pathology in HGPS, based on observations 
in both mouse models (Capell et al., 2008; Osorio et al., 2011) and isolated human studies (Baker et 
al., 1981; Stehbens et al., 2001; Stehbens et al., 1999; Gerhard-Herman et al., 2012). The above 
normal echodensity observed in patients with HGPS is related to the loss of vascular smooth muscle 
cells (VSMC) that are replaced with extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in fibrosis (Gerhard-Herman 
et al., 2012; Gordon et al., 2012). This phenomenon of replacing VSMC with ECM can be induced by 
progerin, along with progerin-related accelerated atherosclerosis and increased plaque vulnerability in 
mouse models (Hamczyk et al., 2018). Furthermore, the severity of atherosclerosis in progeria 
correlates with increased ECM in the human condition (Olive et al., 2010). There are a few atypical 
forms of progeria, also called non-classical progeria in which growth is less retarded, scalp hair fall off 
slowly, progression of lipodystrophy is delayed, osteolysis is more visible with exception in face and 
survival is observed mostly till adulthood (Table 1).

HGPS  negatively  impacts  day-to-day  function.  Once  symptoms  develop,  progression  of  the  disease  is 
inexorable and universally fatal due to accelerated atherosclerosis and premature death, usually from 
myocardial infarction, stroke or congestive heart failure. Despite advances in modern medicine, there 
have been no changes in the life expectancy of children with HGPS (pre/post-1991).

2.1.5.  Management 
There are no drugs approved for the treatment of children with Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome 
(HGPS) or progeroid laminopathies (PLs). Additionally, there are no evidence-based guidelines that 
provide clinicians with effective, safe and standardised treatment regimens. It is for these reasons 
there is no broadly recognised and commercially available standard of care.  
Other medications used to treat HGPS include low-dose aspirin, statins to lower cholesterol, 
antihypertensives to lower blood pressure, anticoagulants to help prevent blood clots, and various 
medications to treat headaches and seizures.  
Examples of supportive care include hearing aids as clinically needed; ocular lubrication for exposure 
keratopathy; tooth extractions for dental crowding; physical and occupational therapy for skeletal 
abnormalities and joint contractures; annual screening with ECG, echocardiogram, carotid ultrasound, 
MRI/MRA of head and neck, bone density/structure imaging, hip x-ray (Gordon et al., 2019). 
While these measures may provide some comfort for patients with HGPS and PLs, they are only 
supportive and are limited to symptom management to reduce the risk of secondary complications.  
For the above reasons, lonafarnib may be a welcomed treatment modality. 
2.2.  About the product 
Lonafarnib (4-[2-[4-[(11R)-3,10-dibromo-8-chloro-6,11-dihydro-5H-benzo[1,2]cyclohepta[2,4-
b]pyridin-11-yl]piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxoethyl]piperidine-1-carboxamide) is a potent and specific inhibitor 
of farnesyltransferase (FTI). 
Lamin A and progerin are both farnesylated. However, farnesylated-progerin cannot be cleaved, 
resulting in tight association with the nuclear envelope, resulting in changes in nuclear envelope 
morphology and subsequent cellular damage. Lonafarnib blocks the farnesylation of progerin. 
Posology 
The recommended starting dosage of ZOKINVY capsules is 115 mg/m2 twice daily. Clinical trials used 
the Du Bois formula for calculating BSA. The complete dosing schedule can be found in the SmPC. Each 
dose is to be taken with food and a sufficient amount of water. After 4 months of treatment with 
ZOKINVY, increase to the maintenance dose of 150 mg/m2 twice daily (morning and evening).  
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
Accelerated assessment 
The CHMP agreed to the Applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that “to date, there is no 
effective disease-modifying treatment available besides the standard of care and interventions for 
symptomatic treatment of HGPS and PLs. Therefore, the CHMP agrees with the applicant that there is 
an unmet medical need for new medicinal products which can modify the disease course of HGPS and 
PLs. Lonafarnib may be a potential candidate to fill in the gap. The data shows encouraging results and 
the overall data package to be submitted seems sufficient to make a benefit/risk assessment. The data 
points to a clinical benefit for the patient, which seems to translate in a lower mortality rate compared 
in the lonafarnib group compared to the untreated group. In addition, there is a plausible mechanistic 
effect in reducing cardiovascular risk based on Corrected carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVcf) 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 13/140 
 
 
 
and Carotid Artery Ultrasonography (echodensity) analysis. Therefore, lonafarnib can be considered 
disease-modifying. Further, it is believed that lonafarnib may contribute to clinical practice and the 
patient’s quality of life. Taking into account all data, it is concluded that at this point, an accelerated 
assessment is recommended.” 
However, during the assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, as among others, major objections were raised regarding the definition of the 
starting materials and GCP, which required more time to solve than possible within the accelerated 
assessment timetable.  
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Marketing Authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of the above-mentioned Regulation based on:  
- the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the 
applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence; 
- it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information.

2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The chemical name of lonafarnib is 4-[2-[4-[(11R)-3,10-dibromo-8-chloro-6,11-dihydro-5H- 
benzo[1,2]cyclohepta [2,4-b]pyridin-11-yl]piperidin-1-yl]-2- oxoethyl]piperidine-1-carboxamide 
corresponding to the molecular formula C27H31Br2ClN4O2. It has a relative molecular mass of 638.8 and 
the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 14/140 
 
 
 
Figure 2: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of lonafarnib was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), 
ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV), and single crystal X-ray crystallography. The solid state properties of the 
active substance were measured by X Ray powder diffraction (XRPD), thermal gravimetric analysis 
(TGA) and water sorption. 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to off-white powder practically insoluble in water 
(<0.1 mg/mL), and sparingly soluble in ethyl acetate (0.9 mg/mL) and tetrahydrofuran (1 mg/mL), 
these solvents are used in the final crystallization of the active substance.  
Information on particle size distribution was not provided since the particle size was not identified as a 
critical material attribute. The active substance is dissolved, along with povidone K30, prior the spray 
drying step and fixated as an amorphous co-precipitate in the spray dried dispersion (SDD) 
intermediate. A 80:20 w/w mixture of dichloromethane: methanol is used for the spray-drying step, in 
which the active substance is freely soluble (10.6 % w/w).  
Lonafarnib exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The active substance is 
the R-enantiomer. The chiral centre is formed in stage I of the synthesis, the S-Enantiomer impurity is 
purged when the salt of the desired R-isomer is selectively crystallized. This salt formation with L-N-
Boc-Asparagine is a major purification procedure. The stereochemical purity is routinely controlled by 
chiral HPLC in the stage 1 Intermediate, as well as in the active substance.  
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Lonafarnib is synthesized using well defined starting materials (SMs) in 3 main stages. 
One of the SMs was not considered acceptable and redefinition to an earlier stage was requested as 
Major Objection (MO). The applicant responded satisfactorily to this MO by submission of a post 
approval change management protocol (PACMP) containing a commitment to redefine this SM, and 
submit this via a post-approval variation. The applicant acknowledged that only the active substance 
batches already currently used for manufacture of finished product batches are accepted for proposed 
marketing of finished product batches, and updated the dossier to include all information on these 
batches. No additional batches will be used for commercial distribution until new active substance 
manufactured with the redefined starting material will be available.  
Critical steps of the synthetic process have been identified and described in detail. And appropriate in 
process controls have been put in place.  For the defined intermediates acceptable specifications have 
been presented. 
Information on genotoxic and potential genotoxic impurities has been provided and is sufficient. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 15/140 
 
 
 
 
The identity, origin, fate, purge, carryover and control of the of the lonafarnib active substance, and 
starting material impurities were discussed.  The discussion is divided into non-genotoxic and 
genotoxic impurities related to either the active substance or starting materials.  The impurity control 
strategy is based on ICH M7 and ICH Q3A.  The Stage 1 and Stage 2 intermediate impurity acceptance 
criteria were tightened to limit carryover of the impurities. Available spiking results were provided 
during the procedure and considered acceptable to support adequacy of the proposed control strategy, 
especially after redefinition of one of the starting materials.  
The applicant adopts limits for elemental impurities in the specification of the active substance. None of 
these elements is added to the process with the exception of one element. The applicant has explained 
that the elemental impurities are controlled in line with ICH Q3D, which is acceptable, however, routine 
testing is not required if it can be demonstrated that the elemental impurities are consistently below 
30% of the ICH Q3D limits. During the procedure, the applicant has provided the commitment to 
evaluate whether the elemental impurities can be omitted from the specifications, and remove them 
from the specification, if possible; which is acceptable as well (through submission of a variation). 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
No process validation data was included in the original application. Process validation will be executed 
concurrent to the commercial manufacturing. Given the ultrarare nature of the disease and thus limited 
commercial demand, a concurrent validation approach is acceptable (see recommendation). During the 
procedure, the applicant provided batch results of one commercial size process validation batch. 
The container closure system for lonafarnib active substance consists of double-lined low-density 
polyethylene bags. Relevant information, i.e. specification, compliance with relevant legislation (EU 
10/2011, Ph.Eur. 3.1.5), and details on the composition of the materials were provided and considered 
acceptable. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual), identity (IR, HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), chiral impurity (chiral HPLC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), residue on 
ignition (Ph. Eur.), moisture (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), genotoxic impurities (LC-MS), and 
microbial purity (Ph. Eur.). 
Test and limits with respect to appearance, identity, assay, residue on ignition, moisture, and 
microbiological limits are set as per general (European) guidance and considered acceptable. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Residual solvents likely to be present in the active substance were limited to the levels per Option 1 
criteria defined in ICH Guideline Q3C with the exception of tetrahydrofuran (THF), which is controlled 
at the level of the spray-dried intermediate, and ethylbenzene, which is not specified in ICHQ3C, but 
for which adequate justification of the limit was provided. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022

Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided: three registration batches produced at the 
commercial site, and ten supportive batches produced either at the commercial site or at a 
development site. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from three batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer (one 
commercial-scale process validation batch and two smaller-scale registration batches) stored in the 
intended commercial package for 3 to 9 months under long term conditions (25 ºC/60% RH) and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. Stability data from five supportive batches of active substance stored for 12-36 months 
under long term conditions (25 ºC/60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters under long term and accelerated conditions were within the specifications. 
For one development batch, a solid state stress study (thermal stress at 60°C-4weeks, and 
60°C/80%RH-4weeks), and photostability stress study following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed, 
as well as polymorphic stability testing after storage for up to 36 months under long term conditions 
(25 ºC/60% RH) and up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH). 
There was no significant degradation of the solid samples stressed under thermal and ICH light 
conditions. Photostability studies demonstrated no significant change in the assay or related 
compounds, and no change to physical appearance, moisture, crystalline form and IR spectrum. 
No polymorphic conversion was observed in the polymorphic stability testing study. 
Any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the 
Rapporteur and EMA. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier(s) is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months in the proposed 
container, without any special temperature storage conditions. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as immediate-release hard gelatin capsules for oral administration. 
The 50 mg strength is a size ‘4’ opaque yellow hard gelatin capsule with a black “50” imprint on the 
body and “LNF’’ imprint on the cap. The 75 mg strength is a size ‘3’ opaque light orange hard gelatin 
capsule with a black “75” imprint on the body and “LNF’’ imprint on the cap. The same blend is filled 
into the capsule.  
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as an immediate release dosage form, which has 
adequate bioavailability, that meets compendial and other relevant quality standards for uniformity of 
dosage units and dissolution, and would be sufficiently stable to ensure an adequate shelf-life given the 
ultra-rare indication.  
The crystalline lonafarnib is practically insoluble in aqueous media (<0.2 mg/ml). The finished product 
contains amorphous lonafarnib stabilized in a povidone matrix, which is produced by dissolving 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 17/140 
 
 
 
lonafarnib and povidone in methylene chloride and methanol (80:20 W/W) and spray drying the 
solution. This amorphous lonafarnib coprecipitate has a higher solubility (~30X) than the crystalline 
form, and in preclinical animal PK studies, has shown enhanced bioavailability than that of the 
crystalline form. Therefore, the amorphous coprecipitate (further called spray-dried dispersion (SDD) 
Intermediate) was deemed to be the more desirable form to develop formulations with acceptable 
bioavailability.  
The SDD intermediate is further processed into a granulate by roller compaction, followed by 
manufacturing a blend which is encapsulated into hard gelatin capsules. 
The encapsulation blend composition is identical for both the 50 and the 75mg strength and the 
different strengths are achieved by different filling volume within differently sized capsule shells. 
A hard gelatin capsule formulation was chosen as final finished product as they offer immediate release 
drug and flexibility of the formulated product. 
The critical quality attributes (CQAs) identified were related substances/impurities/degradation 
products, crystallinity, uniformity of dosage units and dissolution.  
The  relationship  between  CQAs  and  Critical  Process  Parameters  (CPPs)  was  further  explored  by 
conducting risk assessments and experimental studies to understand any interactions. Likewise, material 
attributes whose variability has a significant impact on a finished product CQA were also evaluated. 
The crystalline solid-state form of the active substance was not identified as a critical material attribute 
since the active substance is dissolved in solvents and fixated as an amorphous co-precipitate with 
Povidone K30 during the spray-drying step in the SDD Intermediate. Absence of crystalline active 
substance is controlled upon release and stability of the SDD Intermediate. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Excipient compatibility studies were conducted. Compatibility of the active substance with the 
formulation components is further supported by extensive stability studies.  
An assessment was conducted to identify potential CPPs and input/in-process material attributes, 
which impact the quality of the finished product. These variables were then investigated during process 
development to better understand the manufacturing process and to develop a control strategy to 
reduce the risk of a failed batch. Ultimately, the control strategy for the commercial finished product 
manufacturing process was developed by a combination of process characterization studies, clinical 
manufacturing experience and risk assessment.  
There were no major changes to the SDD Intermediate or finished product manufacturing process over 
the product history. Minor process adjustments for the purpose of improving process robustness, 
scale-up and equipment availability were implemented. Clinical batches produced at different 
production sites are considered equivalent to each other and are representative as development 
batches for the proposed commercial process.  
The spray drying process is performed to rapidly remove solvents from the atomized droplets, forming 
the amorphous solid dispersion. Any residual solvents are further reduced during the secondary drying 
process. The final drying step also decreases any residual water. The process is adequately controlled 
by monitoring selected process parameters and performing testing on the SDD Intermediate. 
A residual solvent risk assessment for the finished product was performed in accordance with 
applicable standards, which demonstrates that residual solvents in the finished product are consistently 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 18/140 
 
 
 
below ICH control thresholds, and thus, no testing of the finished product for residual solvents needs 
be considered.  
For the residual solvents, acceptance criteria meet ICH Q3C.  
Sufficient information has been provided to justify the present formulation is suitable for the paediatric 
population which might use the current finished product. The capsule sizes used are the smallest sizes 
available, furthermore, the capsules may be opened and the content can be added to a suitable 
vehicle. Compatibility studies were conducted with diluents such as orange juice. A relative 
bioequivalence study demonstrated that administration of lonafarnib suspension in orange juice and as 
an intact capsule resulted in a similar concentration versus time profile. Detailed directions for mixing 
and administering lonafarnib in a suspension in orange juice are included in the SmPC. 
The selection of the dissolution method (basket apparatus, surfactant type, rotation speed, medium 
volume, temperature) was sufficiently justified, and the discriminatory power of the dissolution method 
towards various formulations and process parameters, has been demonstrated. The applicant also 
demonstrated that the dissolution method is able to discriminate levels of crystalline active substance 
in the finished product if present above the specification limit. During the procedure the applicant 
lowered the concentration of surfactant, at request of the CHMP. The updated method was validated, 
and method and validation data incorporated in the dossier. The updated method will be used for 
release testing and stability testing of future commercial batches, whereas the previous method will 
continue to be used for batches that are currently on stability, as to allow direct comparison of stability 
data to release data and facilitate evaluation of any potential stability trends.  
The principles of the CHMP Guideline on The Investigation of Bioequivalence (Doc. Ref.: 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **) have been used to support the conclusion that 50 mg 
batches and 75 mg batches manufactured at the same manufacturing site, according to the same 
process, are bioequivalent. The bioequivalence claim was substantiated by an f2 similarity comparison 
of in vitro dissolution data (3 batches per strength). Based on this, in-vivo bioequivalence study was 
waived. 
During  the  procedure,  a  MO  was  raised  on  lacking  pharmaceutical  development  information  and 
consequent  inadequate  link  between  the  clinical  batches  and  the  commercial  finished  product.  In  the 
response  to  this  MO,  the  applicant  has  provided  sufficient  data  to  show  that  the  batches  used  in  the 
clinical studies had the same composition and were made by similar processes as the commercial batches, 
and that all batches are of comparable quality and have similar dissolution profiles, and are therefore 
expected to behave similar in vivo as well. 
Stress studies conducted for both the SDD intermediate and the finished product demonstrated the 
products to be sensitive to moisture. Water content was found to promote formation of a hydrolysis 
degradant. Thus, the container closure systems for both the SDD Intermediate and the commercial 
finished product were chosen based on the need for moisture barrier packaging.  
The container closure for the SDD intermediate is a double Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) bag in a 
heat-sealed foil bag. In addition, a desiccant is added between interior and exterior LDPE bags. 
The primary packaging of the finished product is a HDPE bottle, containing desiccant in a cannister and 
capsules,  with  induction  seal  and  polypropylene  cap.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  
The choice of the container closure system for the SDD intermediate and the finished product has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The SDD intermediate is manufactured by one manufacturing site. 
The manufacturing process of the SDD intermediate consists of five main steps:  
•  Solids Dispensing 
•  Solution Preparation 
•  Spray Drying 
•  Secondary Drying 
• 
Packaging 
The  manufacturing  process  for  the  SDD  Intermediate  consists  of  a  non-sterile  spray-drying  operation 
using standard industry equipment, followed by a secondary tray drying operation. 
The capsules are manufactured by one manufacturing site. 
The manufacturing process of the capsules consists of four main steps:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Granulation by roller-compacting a blend of SDD Intermediate with excipients  
Blending of the granulate with excipients  
Encapsulation  
Primary packaging, labeling and secondary packaging  
The manufacturing process of the capsules is a standard non-sterile manufacturing process. 
Process parameters and attributes were evaluated for inclusion in the process controls program and 
criticality based on assessment of risk to the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs). For each critical 
manufacturing step, process parameters (PPs) and in-process controls (IPCs) have been classified and 
acceptance criteria defined.  
The SDD Intermediate undergoes full testing according to appropriate specifications including tests for: 
appearance (visual), identity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), water content (Ph. 
Eur.), residual solvents (GC-HS), crystallinity (XPRD), microbial content (Ph. Eur.), specified micro-
organisms (Ph. Eur.). 
A holding time of 24 months is adopted for the SDD intermediate, based on stability data (see below 
under ‘Stability of the SDD intermediate’). 
No process validation data is provided in the original application. Process validation will be executed 
concurrent to the commercial finished product distribution. Given the ultrarare nature of the disease to 
be treated and thus, a limited commercial demand, a concurrent validation approach is acceptable (see 
recommendation): prior to distribution of each dosage strength, the applicant intends to complete 
production and concurrently assess one commercial scale process performance qualification (PPQ) 
batch of: lonafarnib, lonafarnib SDD intermediate, lonafarnib capsules, 50mg, and lonafarnib capsules, 
75mg. Each batch will be concurrently assessed against the PPQ protocol and released if it meets the 
acceptance criteria., i.e., PPQ product will be released concurrently to commercial distribution. In 
addition, all batches manufactured in the concurrent release program (Lonafarnib, SDD Intermediate 
and Lonafarnib Capsules) will be placed into a stability program at long-term and accelerated 
conditions. Process validation scheme/protocols for the SDD intermediate and for the capsule 
manufacturing processes were provided.

2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance (visual), identity (HPLC, HPLC-UV), assay (HPLC),  related substances (HPLC), dissolution 
(HPLC/Ph. Eur.), disintegration (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), 
crystallinity (XPRD), microbial content (Ph. Eur.), specified micro-organisms (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specification tests and limits are considered acceptable and have been sufficiently 
justified and/or revised during the procedure as requested. Batch data showed compliance to the 
specification.  
During the procedure, the CHMP requested the applicant, via a MO, to tighten the proposed limit for 
dissolution in the finished product specification. In order to respond, the Applicant tightened the 
dissolution specification. The applicant also tightened the specification for dichloromethane. The CHMP 
recommended to validate an assay to measure residual carbon tetrachloride content in methylene 
chloride raw material at levels below compendial requirements, this to control carbon tetrachloride in 
dichloromethane before manufacturing of any additional SDD intermediate batches. The latter will be 
submitted through a post-approval variation (see recommendation).  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in 
the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
In order to respond to a MO on lack of nitrosamine risk assessment, the Applicant performed a risk 
evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product considering all 
suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, the applicant was further 
requested to discuss the risk for formation of Diisopropylnitrosamine (NDIPA) / DIPNA), perform 
confirmatory testing, and – as appropriate - implement a control strategy. Based on the results of 
three batches of active substance and three batches of finished product, in which the level of NDIPA is 
below 10% of the limit, omission of a specification is justified. Carry-over of nitrite is not considered a 
potential risk. The applicant has explained how nitrite, if present, will be removed from the process 
supported by information on nitrite purge factors and confirmatory testing of nitrite level for three 
batches of starting material and on process water. As nitrite is not carried over in the synthesis, there 
is no risk for nitrosamine formation. Based on this, no additional control measures are deemed 
necessary.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three batches per strength (3 small-scale batches for the 50-mg 
strength, 2 small-scale and 1 commercial scale batch for the 75-mg strength) manufactured at the 
proposed commercial manufacturing site, as well as supportive (clinical) batches (three for 50-mg 
strength and two for the 75-mg strength) manufactured at development sites according to a 
manufacturing process representative for the proposed commercial process. The data package 
confirms the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022

The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing.  
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the SDD intermediate 
Stability data from one development batch, two registration batches and one PPQ batch of SDD 
intermediate, stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25°C/60% RH) and up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Stability study results showed little or no changes in appearance, water content, assay and crystallinity 
at both long-term (25°C/60% RH) and accelerated (40°C/75% RH) conditions for all investigated 
batches throughout the testing period. The level of one degradant increased slightly under long-term 
conditions and more significantly under accelerated conditions, resulting at an out-of-specification 
result at 6 months 40°C/75% RH for the development batch. However, the level of the degradant 
remained within the specification limit over the entire tested period at the long-term storage condition 
for all the tested batches. 
These data support a retest period of 24 months, when stored at 25°C/60% RH. 
2.4.3.5.  Stability of the finished product 
Stability data from six batches of the 50-mg strength, and five batches of the 75-mg strength, stored 
for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. For each strength, 3 batches 
were  manufactured  at  the  commercial  manufacturing  site,  with  batch  size  of  at  least  10%  of  the 
commercial batch size packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The other (supportive) 
batches are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in representative primary 
packaging.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, related substances, dissolution, water content, crystallinity, 
and microbial content. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. They are identical to the 
ones used for release of these batches. The new dissolution method, which utilizes a lower concentration 
of SDS as a surfactant, will be used for release testing and stability on future commercial batches. 
In all studies, the product met specifications throughout shelf-life for all investigated stability 
conditions. There were no significant changes in appearance, assay, and dissolution. One degradant 
and water content increased gradually over time but remained within specifications. This increase was 
more pronounced under the accelerated storage conditions. Trending of Water Content results from 
stability studies of both formulations indicates that the proposed release and shelf-life specifications 
assure that the primary degradation product will remain within specification at 36 months at 
recommended storage condition. 
Crystallinity  remained  unchanged  over  shelf-life  and  microbial  specifications  were  met  under  all 
investigated conditions. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines2, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.

In  addition,  one  batch  of  each  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The photostability data show that light has 
no significant effect on the physical and chemical characteristics of the capsules. 
In-use  (in  opened  bottles)  stability  studies  were  performed  for  both  finished  product  strengths  at 
25°C/60%RH for up to 30 days. The test results after 30 days complied with specifications and all tested 
parameters were well within limits. The applicant has not included a separate in-use shelf life for the 
finished product in the SmPC; this is acceptable based on the results of the in-use study. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years and storage conditions ‘Store in the 
original package. Keep the bottle tightly closed to protect from moisture. This medicinal product does 
not require any special temperature storage conditions.’ as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) 
are acceptable. 
2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine source is used for the capsules. Valid TSE CEPs from the suppliers of all 
sources of the gelatine is provided.  
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. The magnesium stearate is 
confirmed to be of vegetable origin. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
A number of issues were raised by CHMP as Major Objections (MO) related to acceptability of one of 
the starting materials, incomplete pharmaceutical development section / inadequate link between 
clinical and commercial batches, acceptability of the dissolution method and specifications, and lacking 
nitrosamine risk assessment. The issues were resolved satisfactorily by the applicant, with provision of 
additional information and justifications. With regard to the redefinition of the starting material the 
CHMP accepted that the applicant would implement the redefinition to the new starting material post-
approval– as committed by the applicant through a post-approval change management protocol. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were two minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on 
the benefit/risk ratio of the product, which pertain to concurrent validation approach for active 
substance, SDD intermediate and finished product and the need to develop and validate an assay to 
measure carbon tetrachloride in methylene chloride raw material. These points are put forward and 
agreed as recommendations for future quality development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  To execute process validation concurrent to the commercial finished product distribution. Prior 
to distribution of each dosage strength, during production, one commercial scale process 
performance qualification (PPQ) batch of: Lonafarnib active substance, Lonafarnib SDD 
intermediate, Lonafarnib Capsules, 50mg, and Lonafarnib Capsules, 75mg should be 
concurrently assessed against the PPQ protocol that was submitted during the MAA procedure, 
and released if it meets the acceptance criteria., i.e., PPQ product will be released 
concurrently to commercial distribution. In addition, all batches manufactured in the 
concurrent release program (Lonafarnib active substance, SDD Intermediate and Lonafarnib 
Capsules) should be placed into a stability program at long-term and accelerated conditions.  
2.  To submit the analytical procedure to measure carbon tetrachloride in methylene chloride, 
including full validation data. A variation application should be submitted using the variation 
classification of type IB, B.II.c.1.f.  
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Pharmacology 
2.5.1.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Mechanism of action 
HGPS is caused by genetic mutations in the lamin A/C (LMNA) gene, coding for the nuclear lamina 
proteins lamin A and lamin C. The lamina, located inside the inner nuclear membrane, have been 
shown to have significant roles in DNA replication, transcription, chromatin organisation, nuclear 
shape, and cell division. Normal prelamin A undergoes a farnesylation of a CaaX motif at its C-
terminal, which locates the prelamin protein to the nuclear membrane, where it is defarnesylated 
before becoming functional lamin A in the lamina. In contrast, the mutant protein retains the farnesyl 
group resulting in an accumulation of this farnesylated abnormal lamin A protein (progerin) in the 
nuclear membrane.  
Progeroid laminopathies (PLs) are caused by mutations in LMNA or mutations in proteins affecting the 
post-translational pathway of LMNA. The LM variants that result from processing-deficient mutations 
can progress to clinical features that overlap with HGPS. 
By inhibiting farnesyltransferase, Lonafarnib targets a step believed to be a pathophysiological 
hallmark, preventing farnesylation and subsequent accumulation in the inner nuclear membrane of 
progerin or progerin-like proteins. In HGPS, the progerin accumulation typically leads to a disturbed 
nuclear architecture that appear as a nuclear blebbing. The accumulation of progerin or progerin-like 
proteins is thought to be responsible for the clinical manifestations of HGPS and certain forms of PL. 
Primary pharmacodynamics in vitro 
The potency of lonafarnib (SCH 66336) was determined in a biochemical assay, where its ability to 
inhibit farnesylation of H-Ras, on its C-terminal CVLS, was investigated in comparison to inhibitory 
activity towards the related enzyme geranylgeranyl protein transferase-1 (GGPT-1) (Njorge et al. 
1998). Lonafarnib inhibited human farnesyl protein transferase with an IC50 of 1.9 nM and was only

EMA/656670/2022  
Page 24/140 
 
 
 
weakly active against the rat brain GGPT-1 (IC50>50 µM), claimed to be closely related to farnesyl 
protein transferase. 
Inhibition of farnesylation of progerin by treatment with lonafarnib at the cellular level, blocked the 
nuclear blebbing in HeLa cells transfected with wild type lamin A or progerin, and in cultured dermal 
fibroblasts from HGPS patients (Capell et al., 2005). Lonafarnib at all tested doses (0.5 - 2 µM) 
significantly reduced nuclear blebbing in progerin-transfected HeLa cells (p<0.001) and HGPS dermal 
fibroblasts (p<0.001) in dose-dependent fashion (see also clinical reports from John Hopkins and Wuxi, 
where Lonafarnib showed a blebbing reducing effect in both HGPS and PL derived cultured fibroblasts, 
however without a clear dose-response). Moreover, by transfecting an SSIM motif that could not be 
farnesylated into HeLa cells, the critical involvement of prenylation/farnesylation of progerin for the 
appearance of nuclear blebbing was demonstrated. Without prenylation/farnesylation, there was no 
progerin-induced nuclear blebbing, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy imaging. (Similar results 
were noted in HEK 293 cells and NIH 3T3 cells with other FTIs). In addition, it was found that progerin 
is not alternatively geranylgeranylated when farnesylation is inhibited. This is in contrast to K- and N-
Ras, some other substrates of farnesyl transferase, that upon treatment with FTIs are alternatively 
prenylated by geranylgeranyl transferase-1 (Basso et al, 2005). 
In addition, data from a supportive in vitro pharmacodynamic study with Lonafarnib in a non-progeria 
related cellular model was presented. A pharmacodynamic effect by Lonafarnib on a farnesylation 
dependent process in a hepatitis D virus (HDV) cellular model was investigated. In vitro, HDV virion 
assembly critically depends on prenylation/farnesylation of its nucleocapsid-like protein large delta 
antigen (LHDAg). Lonafarnib blocked the release of LHDAg from the cells with an EC50 of 35 pM (2.4 
ng/mL). 
Primary pharmacodynamics in vivo 
During the procedure, the Applicant provided additional results from a prepublication by Yale 
university, which shows how lonafarnib in a mouse model of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome 
(homozygous LmnaG609G/G609G mice) prolonged survival (100% survival of the treated progeria 
mice to the study end-point (time of 50% survival of untreated mice)). Furthermore, an improvement 
in cardiovascular function,  a modest improvement in arterial structure and function, translated into a 
significantly reduced pulse wave velocity and improvement left ventricular diastolic function. The study 
design included untreated wild-type littermate controls, untreated progeria mice, and progeria mice 
given lonafarnib daily in the chow from postnatal day P21 to P168. All 6 lonafarnib-treated progeria 
mice survived to the intended end-point, P168, while 10 of the 19 untreated mice (~53%) died. A 
formal report on these data was requested, but this was not presented since the Applicant does not 
own the data. However, the study described in the paper appears to have been well pursued. Sufficient 
non-clinical support for the hypothesized MoA is provided, although a full understanding of the 
lonafarnib induced effects on the set of complex mechanisms potentially affected is not possible to 
reach at this point. As expected, a considerable uncertainty is difficult to avoid due to the translational 
distance between animal models and clinical use. Since no formal report is possible to access, the 
request for a formal report is not further pursued.  
Before these results became available, as described above, a non-clinical proof of concept study with 
lonafarnib treatment in a progeria animal model had not been carried out. Instead of bridging the in 
vitro findings, in vivo pharmacodynamic studies with Lonafarnib in a non-progeria animal model in a 
Ras-dependent oncology model (Njoroge et al., 1998) were carried out. Farnesylation of Ras matures it 
into its biologically active form in oncogenesis. Consequently, FPT has been of considerable interest as 
a potential therapeutic target in oncology. In the actual study, xeno- and syngeneic tumour models in 
nude mice were transplanted with human or murine carcinoma cell lines, respectively, containing a 
mutated K- or H-ras isoform. Lonafarnib was administered PO, QID at 2.5, 10 and 40 mpk or at 10 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 25/140 
 
 
 
50 mpk (DLD-1 model). In the DLD-1 model, lonafarnib treatment resulted in a 76% tumour growth 
inhibition at 50 mpk and 40% at 10 mpk, indicating a dose-dependent response. In the MIA PaCa-2, 
HCT-116 and NIH3T3-CVLS models, lonafarnib also resulted in a dose-dependent tumour growth 
inhibition ranging from approximately 15 – 50% at 2.5 mpk; 50-70% at 10 mpk to 75-100% at 40 
mpk. In conclusion, Lonafarnib demonstrated anti-tumour activity in these animal models in a dose-
dependent manner. 
Supporting bridging studies in progeria animal models were provided as studies of treatments with 
other Farnesyl transfer inhibitors (FTIs). ZMPSTE24-deficient mice, which have an impaired ability to 
defarnesylate farnesylated lamin A and thus accumulate progerin in the nuclear membrane, shows 
increased mortality, reduced body weight, grip strength and bone integrity (Fong et al. 2006). The FTI, 
ABT-100 was orally administered via drinking water beginning at 5 weeks of age (n=6-9/ group) at a 
dose of 39 mg/kg/day. Immunoblots of HDJ-2, a biomarker of FTI activity, demonstrated that protein 
farnesylation was inhibited by FTI in vivo. Between 20 and 50% of HDJ-2 in extracts of tail biopsies 
was nonfarnesylated, and nonfarnesylated prelamin A was detected in the tail extracts from FTI-
treated, but not from untreated, wild-type mice. Treatment with ABT-100 resulted in body weight gain 
(p<0.0001), delayed grip abnormalities (p<0.05), reduced the median number of rib abnormalities 
(p=0.0002), and reduced mortality (FTI-vs. vehicle-treated mice: 1/13 and 6/14 deaths respectively, 
p<0.05). In contrast to the body weight gain observed in the FTI-treated ZMPSTE24-deficient mice, 
wild-type mice treated with FTI showed reduced body weights relative to vehicle-treated wild-type 
mice, with significant reductions observed in females (p=0.022). However, no direct association 
between improved nuclear morphology and phenotype improvement could be confirmed. However, the 
ZMPSTE24-deficient mice treated with FTI did not display a complete elimination of diseased 
phenotype. The Applicant suggests this can play a role in the absence of a direct association between 
improved nuclear morphology and phenotype improvements.  
Another supporting study with a different FTI, tipifarnib, was carried out in the C608G LMNA transgenic 
mouse, a progeria mouse model mimicking the cardiovascular disease of progeria. The C608G LMNA 
mouse model shows progressive loss of vascular smooth muscle cells in the media of the large 
arteries, in a pattern similar to the cardio-vascular disease seen in patients with HGPS. 
Tipifarnib was orally administered via the diet starting at: I) 1 month of age until 9 to 12 months of 
age (n=13-15/group); II) 9 months of age, continuing for a 6-months period. Treatment with tipifarnib 
with a start at 1 month of age resulted in decreased total cholesterol (p=0.00032), total protein 
(p=0.0027), and creatinine (p=0.0027), while significantly increasing alkaline phosphatase (p=0.016). 
Moreover, a reduced cardiovascular disease progression was demonstrated, manifesting as an 
increased abundance of vascular smooth muscle cells affecting the descending aorta (p= 0.0014) and 
ascending aorta (p=0.0090). Improvement in vascular smooth muscle cell integrity was also noted 
following tipifarnib treatment and a decrease in proteoglycan deposition in the descending aorta. 
Treatment with tipifarnib starting at 9 months of age resulted in reduced progression of vascular 
smooth muscle cell loss relative to vehicle-treated controls (p<0.01). The observed reduction in 
cardiovascular disease progression affected all vessels, including the descending aorta, ascending 
aorta, carotid artery, and abdominal aorta. 
The Applicant also provided a supportive in vivo pharmacodynamic study with FTIs in another non-
progeria farnesylation dependent animal model. In this Hepatitis D Virus (HDV) infection mouse model, 
HDV virion assembly critically depends on prenylation/farnesylation of its nucleocapsid-like protein 
large delta antigen, as has been determined in vitro. HDV-encoding plasmids were co-injected with the 
full-length HBV genome IV into HBV-transgenic FVB mice (HDV depends on HBV envelope protein to 
become infective). The prenylation inhibitors FTI-277 and FTI-2153 or vehicle were administrated by IP 
injections QD for one week (n= not provided) at a dose of 50 mg/kg/d. HDV viremia was readily 
detectable in mice receiving vehicle controls but not in the serum of parallel cohorts of FTI-treated

mice (for both compounds). HDV RNA levels were comparable in the livers of mice in all treatment 
groups. The Applicant concludes that although not examined in this study, it is expected that 
Lonafarnib would show similar effects as other prenylation inhibitors based on a common mechanism 
of action. The Applicant’s reasoning can be followed.  
2.5.1.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Four secondary pharmacodynamic studies were carried out with Lonafarnib and the HM21 metabolite 
including a broad off-target receptor screen with Lonafarnib and the main metabolite HM21. Lonafarnib 
showed antagonist activity with an IC50 < 10 µM at four molecular targets: B1 adrenoceptors (ADRB1) 
(IC50 = 2.1 µM), cannabinoid-1 (CNR1) (IC50 = 1.2 µM), cannabinoid 2 (CNR2) (IC50 = 2.0 µM), and 
OX1 (IC50 = 7.1 µM). The HM21 metabolite showed antagonist activity with an IC50 < 10 µM at three 
molecular targets, including ADRB1 (IC50 = 3.5 µM), CNR2 (IC50 = 4.4 µM), and mu-1 opioid receptor 
(OPRM1) (IC50 = 3.6 µM), and agonist activity at one molecular target (5-hydroxtryptamine 1b 
[HTR1B]; EC50 = 2.2 µM). The calculation of safety margins indicate that secondary pharmacology is 
not considered a concern for lonafarnib.  
An additional metabolite, HM17, was also present at concentrations at least 10% of the parent drug; 
however, HM17 cannot be stably synthesised. Therefore, evaluation of the secondary 
pharmacodynamics of this metabolite was not possible. In addition, in study P-6339 it is referred to a 
radioligand binding study performed by Panlab. It is stated that inhibition of muscarinic M2 and M3 by 
SCH66336 was observed. However, dating some twenty years back, the study report could not be 
retrieved. Therefore, the metabolite HM21 was clarified as being the same designated as M33. 
2.5.1.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Lonafarnib was evaluated for the core battery of safety pharmacological parameters in the central 
nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. In addition, effects on gastrointestinal, renal, and 
hepatic systems were also evaluated. Several safety pharmacology parameters were investigated in 
two separate non-GLP studies in rats. 
Voltage clamp studies were conducted in mouse L-929 cells transfected with hERG, in a non-GLP 
compliant study. The hERG IC50 was 1.3 µM (0.83 µg/mL), which is approximately 3 times below the 
clinical Cmax (2.64 µg/mL). A commonly used pragmatic approach in drug development is to set an 
absolute hERG potency cut-off value at 10 µM, since test substances with IC50 values below 10 µM are 
considered to have an increased risk of causing a QTc prolongation in the clinic (Pollard et al., 2017). 
However, when considering the plasma protein binding of lonafarnib, which was very high (>99%), the 
free fraction concentration in the patient (0.01 x 2.64 µg/mL = 0.026 µg/mL) is 32 times lower than 
the hERG IC50. 
In the in vitro study in isolated dog cardiac Purkinje fibres, no significant effects of lonafarnib were 
observed. 
In the in vivo study, cannulated rats administered lonafarnib (≥30 mg/kg) showed significant 
prolongation of the QT interval compared to control. Repolarisation through Ikr (such as hERG) does 
not contribute significantly to repolarisation in rodents. The effect of lonafarnib on other ion channels in 
rat can thus not be excluded. No alteration by lonafarnib was observed in the male guinea pigs at the 
QTc interval.  
ECG was analysed in the repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys. No effects by lonafarnib were 
observed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 27/140 
 
 
 
Increase in QTc was measured in the patients in the ProLon 1 and ProLon 2 studies in which 
prolongation of the QTc values were observed.  
Taken together, there is no clear signal of QTc prolongation from the non-clinical studies while in the 
clinic, QTc prolongation has been observed.  
The effect of lonafarnib on the gastrointestinal system regarding in vivo transit time and damage to 
gastric mucosa was studied in rats. Lonafarnib at 100 mg/kg inhibited gastric emptying and intestinal 
transit. In a second study, higher doses were administered repeatedly, and 500 mg/kg caused a 
significant inhibition of gastric emptying. No exposure was measured in the animals, but a Cmax value 
of 29.8 µM was measured in animals administered 100 mg/kg. This corresponds to x7 times the Cmax 
observed in patients administered the intended clinical dose of 150 mg/m2 (mean Cmax 2.64 µg/mL/ 
4µM).  
Safety pharmacology studies on renal and liver function were performed, but the data were only briefly 
assessed since the parameters are also discussed in the toxicology section. 
Effects on behavioural, neurological and autonomic changes related to lonafarnib were investigated in 
male rats in a non-GLP study. There were no indications of lonafarnib induced effects on CNS in this 
safety pharmacology study or in any of the repeat dose toxicity studies. The animals were 
administered a single dose of lonafarnib (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg). No exposure was measured in the 
animals, a Cmax value of 29.8 µM was measured in animals administered 100 mg/kg. This 
corresponds to x7 times the Cmax observed in patients administered the intended clinical dose of 150 
mg/m2 (mean Cmax 2.64 µg/mL/ 4µM). 
No stand-alone respiratory safety pharmacology studies were conducted for lonafarnib. There was no 
treatment-related effect on respiratory rate in monkeys treated with daily doses of 15, 30, 60 /10, 20, 
40 mg/kg lonafarnib for 13 weeks or 52 weeks, respectively, as evaluated in the repeat dose toxicity 
studies. The Cmax in animals administered 40 mg/kg on day 1 was 12.8 µg/mL in males and 16.6 
µg/mL in females. This corresponds to x4.8-6.3 times the Cmax observed in patients administered the 
intended clinical dose of 150 mg/m2 (mean Cmax 2.64 µg/mL). 
2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
The bioanalytical HPLC-UV and LC/MS/MS methods used to quantify Lonafarnib in plasma in the 
toxicity studies of rats, rabbits, and monkeys appear to have been validated according to GLP standard 
in most cases. However, no validated GLP compliant bioanalytical methods were developed for plasma 
exposure measurement of Lonafarnib in the definitive rat embryofoetal development (EFD) study 
(SN02292) and in the definite rat pre- and postnatal development toxicity (PPND) study (SN96047).  
Absorption 
The absorption of Lonafarnib was studied in vitro in Cacao cells and in vivo after single oral and 
intravenous dosing to rats and cynomolgus monkeys, where oral dosing is the intended route of 
administration in patients. The in vitro transepithelial permeability of Lonafarnib was high, and [14C]-
Lonafarnib was rapidly absorbed in rats following oral dosing (Tmax ∼ 2-4 hours), whereas the 
absorption of Lonafarnib in monkeys was slower after oral administration (Tmax ∼ 6-8 hours). The half-
life ranged from 1 to 2 hours in rats and 2 to 3.75 hours in monkeys, respectively. The absolute 
bioavailability following oral administration was high in both species (F = 66-91 %), which may be 
attributable to the high permeability of Lonafarnib across cell membranes.  
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 28/140 
 
 
 
Plasma concentrations following repeat oral administration of Lonafarnib in rats, rabbits and monkeys 
are presented in the TK analysis in the toxicology section. 
Distribution 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of Lonafarnib has been studied in rat monkeys and humans with an 
ultrafiltration method. Plasma protein binding of [14C]-Lonafarnib at concentrations between 0.5 and 
40 μg/mL was high (99.0 (rat) to 99.7% (human)) and similar across species for rat, monkey, and 
human plasma. Binding of [14C]-Lonafarnib (0.4 and 2 µg/mL) to human plasma proteins alpha1-acid 
glycoprotein (AAG) and human serum albumin (HSA) and HAS/AAG combinations was also assessed in 
vitro. Binding was high for both proteins (>92.5%) and depended on Lonafarnib concentration for AAG 
and HSA concentrations for HSA. When Lonafarnib was incubated in both HSA and AAG, binding was 
consistent across all concentrations of HSA (95.1 to 98.4%), and the applicant concluded that the total 
binding of Lonafarnib to human plasma proteins might not be affected in pathophysiological conditions 
with low HSA concentrations. 
The tissue distribution of Lonafarnib in pigmented rats (n=2-3) and cynomolgus monkeys (n=1/sex) 
was determined following oral administration of [14C]-Lonafarnib (15, 30 mg/kg) in 0.4% (w/v) MC) by 
oral gavage using both radioactivity analysis and whole-body autoradiography. In rats, all tissues 
evaluated reached maximum concentrations by 4 hours post-dose, except for perirenal fat, spinal cord 
(1-hour post-dose), and Harderian gland (12 hours post-dose; females only). The liver, adrenal glands, 
pancreas, bile duct, and kidneys displayed the highest concentrations of radioactivity for both sexes in 
rats (excluding the GI tract). At 4 hours post-dose, 5 to 8% of the administered dose was present in 
the liver of the remaining tissues; only the skeletal muscle and non-pigmented skin contained greater 
than 1% of the administered dose. There was no apparent binding to pigmented tissue. Similarly, in 
monkeys, the distribution of Lonafarnib-derived radioactivity was highest in the liver, small intestine, 
and eye. Distribution was low for both sexes in the lung and skeletal muscle. 
The brain: plasma ratio of Lonafarnib (30, 60, 90 mg/kg, BID for 8 days) following repeat oral 
administration in rats was evaluated in vivo. The AUC ratio of brain to plasma was about 6.5% at each 
dose level, indicating a low to moderate brain penetration of Lonafarnib. 
In a placental transfer study in pregnant rats, the radioactivity of Lonafarnib was detected in foetal 
blood following oral dosing, with exposure to drug-derived radioactivity in the foetus of approximately 
10% of that seen in dams. Thus, the results of the placental transfer study indicate that Lonafarnib-
related material was transferred to the foetus via the placenta following oral administration to pregnant 
rats. The applicant did not report any milk excretion studies. 
Metabolism  
The metabolite profile of Lonafarnib was determined in mouse (CD-1), rat (Sprague Dawley), monkey 
(male cynomolgus), and human hepatocytes. The in vitro metabolic profiling indicates that Lonafarnib 
was extensively metabolized by rat and monkey hepatocytes and to some lesser extent by mice and 
human hepatocytes. A total of 32 metabolites were characterized following incubation of [14C]-
Lonafarnib with mouse, rat, monkey, and human hepatocytes. The most common metabolic pathways 
included oxidation, dehydrogenation, and/or a combination of these two processes, and the majority of 
metabolites across all species were associated with changes in the region of the pendant piperidine 
ring. No human specific metabolite appears to have been detected in the in vitro studies.  
The in vivo metabolic profile of Lonafarnib was characterized in Sprague Dawley rats and in 
cynomolgus monkeys administered a single oral dose of [14C]-Lonafarnib (15, 30 mg/kg in 0.4% 
methylcellulose) or 5 mg/kg IV (in DMSO in 20% (w/v) HPβCD in a 2:3 (v/v) ratio). The single-dose 
metabolite profiling studies following oral or intravenous administration indicate that Lonafarnib was 
extensively metabolized in both rats and monkeys. A total of 30 metabolites were identified in plasma, 
Assessment report

Page 29/140 
 
 
 
urine (rats only; radioactivity in the urine of monkeys was <1.62% of the dose), and faeces. The 
metabolites appear to have been primarily generated as a result of structural changes of the pendant 
piperidine ring of Lonafarnib, and the predominant metabolic conversions were considered to be 
oxidations and dehydrogenations. In monkeys, the metabolic profiles in both plasma and faeces were 
similar across sexes and dosing routes. In contrast, some metabolites were observed in the rat only in 
male faeces (RM2a and RM3), and RM2b was only detected in female faeces. In the human metabolism 
study (Study P00260), there were no human-specific metabolites detected that were not also detected 
in the rat and monkey following a single oral dose of [14C]-Lonafarnib (104 mg) to healthy subjects. 
Similar to the studies in animals, the common metabolic pathways in humans included oxidation, 
dehydrogenation and combinations of these two processes and the majority of metabolites in man 
resulted from structural changes in the region of the pendant piperidine ring of Lonafarnib. 
Excretion 
Mass balance studies were conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys to determine [14C]-Lonafarnib 
excretion following oral or IV administration. The excretion data in rats and monkeys indicate that 
faecal elimination is the dominant route (> 99% in rats and > 85% in monkeys after IV dosing), 
whereas urinary excretion was limited (< 0.5 to 1.6% in rats and monkeys, respectively). After oral 
and IV administration, the excretion was rapid, and most of the radioactivity was excreted within 48 
hours in intact rats and within 72 hours in fed monkeys. The presence of large amounts of radioactivity 
in the faeces of both species following both oral and IV administration suggests that biliary excretion 
and/or secretion by the gut contribute to eliminating Lonafarnib and its metabolites. In humans, 
Lonafarnib is primarily excreted via faeces (98% of the radioactive administered dose) with minimal 
excretion in urine (<1% unchanged parent).

2.5.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of lonafarnib has been evaluated in non-clinical studies in agreement with 
relevant guidelines. Overall, the toxicity profile of lonafarnib has been characterized via single-dose 
toxicity studies in mice and rats, repeat-dose toxicity studies (up to 6 months in Sprague Dawley rats 
and 12 months in cynomolgus monkeys), genotoxicity and impurity studies, reproductive and 
developmental studies (in Sprague Dawley rats and New Zealand White rabbits) and mechanistic 
studies (nephrotoxicity, myelotoxicity and electroretinography). No studies on juvenile toxicology or 
carcinogenicity have been conducted. 
The oral route of administration was utilized in all pivotal toxicity studies to match the intended clinical 
administration route. 
Lonafarnib is intended for patients with genetic disorders Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome 
(HGPS) and progeria laminopathies (PL), and treatment is intended to be given to children (from 12 
months) and adolescents. Therefore, it needs to be mentioned that the general toxicity studies have 
been conducted in rats with a corresponding human age of 12.5 years or 18 years at the end of the 
studies and in pre-adult or adult cynomolgus monkeys and therefore does not cover totally the age-
stages of this young patient population. 
The recommended clinical maximal dose of lonafarnib is an oral dose of 150 mg/m2 BID and the 
applicant propose that this dose results in an AUC0-12 mean value of 20.6 μg•h/mL and a Cmax value 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 30/140 
 
 
 
of 2.64 µg/mL. Throughout this assessment, these values have been adopted when calculating 
marginals between exposure in animals with that at the maximal clinical dose.  
The Sprague Dawley rat and cynomolgus monkey were selected as the main rodent and non-rodent 
species in the general toxicity studies. Sprague Dawley rat and New Zeeland White rabbits were 
selected for reproduction and developmental studies. 
2.5.3.1.  Single dose toxicity 
A number of GLP compliant single-dose toxicity studies were conducted with oral gavage and IP 
administration in mice (two oral gavage studies and two IP studies) and rats (one oral gavage and one 
IP study), respectively. 
In mice oral gavage studies, mortality was noted at doses of 2000 mg/kg and 1500 mg/kg and 
occurred 24h and 3 days post-dose. In addition to the common clinical signs prior to death, 
observations of soft or scant faeces were noted at high and intermediate doses, indicating an adverse 
effect on the GI tract. Lower body weight gain without an obvious dose-response relation were 
observed despite no changes in food consumption. NOAELs were 300 mg/kg (males) and 1000 mg/kg 
(females) in the first study (SN960277) and 1500 mg/kg (males) and 300 mg/kg (females) in the 
second study (SN97266). The two IP single-dose toxicity mice studies were conducted with a few 
months apart. In the first study (SN96028), dose groups of 0, 100, 200, 400, 600, or 1000 mg/kg 
were tested, whereas the 200 mg/kg dose group was excluded from the second study (SN97267), 
which was otherwise identical to the first study. In both studies, high mortality was seen in the 1000 
mg/kg and 600 mg/kg dose groups. Additionally, mortality was also observed in the 400 mg/kg dose 
group, especially in the second study SN97267. NOAELs were 200 mg/kg for males and females in the 
first study (SN96028) but could not be established in the second study (SN97267). Likewise, LD50 
values were lower in the second study SN97267, compared to the first study SN96028 (489 mg/kg and 
375 mg/kg compared to 716 mg/kg and 772 mg/kg in males and females, respectively). 
In the rat oral gavage single-dose toxicity study, mortality was low (one animal died in the 2000 
mg/kg group), indicating that rats were less sensitive to lornafarnib administered PO compared to 
mice. However, soft and scant faeces was still noted as the most common adverse effect in the high 
dose groups, and NOAELs were 1000 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg for males and females, respectively. In 
rats given lonafarnib IP, mortality was observed in the 600 mg/kg (6/10) and in the 400 mg/kg dose 
group (2/10). In this study, soft and scant faeces was also noted in the high dose groups. 
Hypoactivity, ataxia, and decreased BW gain were observed at a lower dose and NOAELs were set to 
30 mg/kg and <30 mg/kg for males and females, respectively. 
2.5.3.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies, the main organs and tissues affected were primarily liver, male 
reproductive organs (testes and epididymides), lymphoid organs/tissues, haematopoietic system (bone 
marrow) and immune system. Effects were also observed in female reproductive organs, 
gastrointestinal system, eye, adrenal glands, and parathyroid. No NOAELs were established in any of 
the conducted repeat-dose toxicity studies. As discussed below, for most of the treatment-related 
toxicity, there were no (or very low) exposure marginals compared to that in the clinic with the 
intended dosing at 150 mg/m2 BID. 
Treatment-related mortality occurred in the 3-months rat and monkey toxicity studies, while no deaths 
occurred in the longer-term studies. Two female rats died after treatment of 180 mg/kg/day 
lonafarnib. One of the females, who died week 12, displayed liver toxicity (centrilobular hepatocellular 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 31/140 
 
 
 
necrosis and pigmentation and increase of mitoses) indicative of anaemia and hypoxia in the liver, and 
the other female, died week 3; there was no apparent cause of death. The deaths in the female rats 
occurred at an AUC exposure marginal of 21 times to the intended clinical highest dose (150 mg/m2). 
Notably, for the 13-weeks rat study, the exposure of females was 2-3 times higher than male rats. The 
mortalities in cynomolgus monkeys occurred in two males dosed at 60 mg/kg/day at weeks 3 and 9 in 
the 13-weeks study. This dose corresponds to 3.3 -fold higher exposure than the intended clinical dose 
of 150 mg/m2. Both animals were dehydrated with up to severe atrophic changes of lymphoid organs 
(spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes), and the cause of death was attributed to a loss of blood due to 
haemorrhages in multiple organs (severe thrombocytopenia), and hypervolemia and stress. To 
summarize, mortality occurred in two monkeys and two rats after treatment with lonafarnib at doses 
corresponding to 3.3 and 21-fold higher exposure, respectively, compared to the intended clinical dose 
of 150 mg/m2. 
Treatment-related toxicity in the liver was observed in both rat and cynomolgus monkeys and was 
characterised by hepatic dysfunction and a pathologic response to increased metabolic stress. In rats, 
toxicity was observed in both 3- and 6-months studies, which included liver enzyme induction 
(CYP1A1, 1A2, and 2B, CYP2B, CYP3A; only analysed in the 3-months study), increased liver weights, 
and microscopic findings such as centrilobular hypertrophy and vacuolation which was mainly graded 
as minimal in severity. Enzyme induction was observed in males ≥30 mg/kg/day while a potential 
inhibition was observed in female rats at 30 and 90 mg/kg/day, and microscopic findings were 
observed at 60 mg/kg/day in both sexes after 6 months of lonafarnib treatment. No liver enzyme 
induction or inhibition was observed after 5 weeks of recovery in the 3 months study. There were no 
exposure marginals (x 0.11 to 0.68) at the NOAEL for liver findings (enzyme induction, increased 
weight and microscopic changes) in rats compared to that at the intended clinical dose of 150 mg/m2. 
In monkeys, enzyme induction occurred at ≥ 15 mg/kg/day (only analysed in the 3-months study) and 
increased liver weight was observed in both studies. However, no microscopic changes were observed 
in monkeys that were dosed up to 40 and 60 mg/kg/day in the 3-months and 1-year study, 
respectively. In monkeys, the NOAEL for liver findings (enzyme induction, increased weight) occurred 
at no exposure marginals (x 0.63 to 1.22) to the intended clinical dose. To summarize, there were no 
exposure marginals for the observed liver findings (based on increased liver weight and enzyme 
induction). However, the microscopic changes were mild up to 90 mg/kg/day (corresponding to 10- to 
40-fold higher exposure than in the clinic), occurred only in rats, and all liver findings were reversible. 
Therefore, it is considered that the microscopic liver changes may pose only a small risk in the clinic. 
However, the liver enzyme induction occurred at no exposure marginal compared to that in the clinic. 
It should be mentioned that altered liver enzymes have been monitored after lonafarnib treatment in 
the clinic. 
Male reproductive organs were affected after administration with lonafarnib in rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys. In monkeys, effects were observed in the 52 weeks study, with effects observed as an 
approximately 40% decrease of testes weight at the low dose (10 mg/kg/day), which was followed by 
60% and 80% weight decrease at the intermediate dose (20 mg/kg/day) and high dose (40 
mg/kg/day), respectively. Notably, no correlating microscopic testes changes were reported at the low 
dose, while up to severe atrophy of the testicular seminiferous tubules was reported in 3 out of 4 
animals at 20 mg/kg/day, and in all 4 animals at 40 mg/kg. This mismatch between 40% weight loss 
with no corresponding atrophy seems odd. Furthermore, in epididymides, no sperms were observed in 
3 out of 4 animals at 20 mg/kg/day and in all 4 animals at 40 mg/kg/day, and weight loss was 
reported with approximately 30%, 40%, and 60% abs. weight loss at 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg/day, 
respectively. The applicant reports a NOAEL at 10mg/kg/day for monkey male reproductions organ, 
which corresponds to x 1.22 exposure marginal to that in the clinic with the intended dose of 150 
mg/m2. This NOAEL is considered not fully justified based on the apparent weight loss observed at this 
dose level. In rats, effects in male reproductive organs occurred in the 3-months study only. In main 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 32/140 
 
 
 
animals, reduced testicular and epididymal weight loss was observed at the high dose (180 
mg/kg/day) without any corresponding microscopic findings. However, in the recovery group (180 
mg/kg/day; 5 weeks recovery) testicular aspermia and spermatogonial debris and epididymal 
oligospermia and spermatic debris in 1 or 2 males out of 5. In the male fertility study in rats, profound 
effects on fertility, -30% and –90% was observed at 30 and 60 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Toxicity in lymphoid organs and tissues was observed in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In rats, 
toxicity was seen after 3-months administration of lonafarnib and were attributed as lymphoid 
hypocellularity and with corresponding weight loss and the affected organs/tissues included spleen, 
thymus and mesenteric lymph node, and occurred at 30 mg/kg/day but only in few animals (2F) and 
with minimal severity. However, in the intermediate dose group (90 mg/kg/day) the number of 
affected animals increased and the severity grades (up to severe grades). Partial recovery was 
observed after 5 weeks of recovery and included 2 out of 5 females with minimal lymphoid 
hypocellularity. Hypocellularity (decreased erythroids and myeloids) and increased megakaryocytes 
were observed in bone marrow with related haematology findings (for example, dose-related decrease 
of WBCs) indicative of bone marrow suppression was observed. In the long-term rat study, lymphoid 
hypocellularity was limited to thymus with grades of severity up to moderate. In cynomolgus monkeys, 
hypocellularity was limited to the thymus in single or few animals, mild in the bone marrow. The 
NOAELs were at no or low exposure marginals (x 0.68 to 1.87 in rats and 0.63 to 1.22 in cynomolgus 
monkeys) for lymphoid organ/tissue toxicity compared to that at the intended clinical dose of 150 
mg/m2. For bone marrow suppression, the NOAELs were at exposure marginals of x1.87- to 6.60 in rat 
and of x7 in cynomolgus monkeys. The follow-up in vitro myelotoxicity studies revealed a dose-related 
growth inhibition in both monkey and human progenitor cells, suggesting similar levels of 
myelosuppression in the different cell types. 
Ocular findings were observed in monkeys, but not rats, and included single-cell necrosis of the retinal 
photoreceptors in the layer of the rods and cones at 60 mg/kg/day (3-month toxicity study) and in two 
40 mg/kg/day animals (1-year toxicity study). However, in a follow-up ERG study, changes in terms of 
minimal decreases in the scotopic amplitudes were noted at 15 mg/kg/day followed with substantial 
decreases at 60 mg/kg/day. The effect on retinal conductivity was considered to represent potential 
perturbation of the function of the rod cells that would influence on night vision. The applicant 
proposes that as there was an only minimal influence on rod cell function at 15 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL 
for ocular toxicity be based on the findings observed in the 1-year study that is considered to be at 20 
mg/kg/day corresponding to an exposure marginal of x 1.67 to 4.0 compared that in the clinic at the 
intended dose of 150 mg/m2 BID. 
Treatment-related effects in the kidney occurred in rats but not in cynomolgus monkeys. Microscopic 
findings included minimal or slight tubular mineralization and basophilia at ≥90 mg/kg/day in females 
in the 3-months study and interstitial mineralization and basophilia at ≥30 mg/kg/day in both genders. 
Treatment-related effects on urinalysis included, among others, altered calcium/phosphorous/ 
potassium/sodium/chloride excretion. The exploratory nephrotoxicity study in female rats confirmed 
the observed microscopic findings and additional necrosis and vacuolisation findings and the altered 
calcium excretion at 180 mg/kg/day. 
Gastro-intestinal effects were observed only in cynomolgus monkeys and were consistent with 
diarrhoea (soft/water faeces) and loose stools in the 3-months study and microscopical changes 
(increased histiocytes in lamina propria) in the 1-year study. The NOAEL for the gastrointestinal effects 
were at low marginals (x1.22-to 1.67) compared to that at the intended clinical dose 150 mg/m2 BID. 
Notably, diarrhoea and loose stools were frequently reported in clinical studies. However, in safety 
pharmacology studies, gastric emptying and intestinal transit were inhibited by lonafarnib (see 
pharmacology section).

EMA/656670/2022

Toxicity in adrenal glands was observed in male cynomolgus monkeys in the 1-year study and was 
consistent with increased organ weights and minimal/slight vacuolation in the zona fasciculata at 40 
mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for toxicity in adrenal glands were 4-fold higher AUC exposure marginal 
compared to human exposure at 150 mg/m2 BID. 
Effects on the parathyroid were seen in female rats, which included cytoplasmic vacuolation at ≥90 
mg/kg/day in the 3-months study, which was not reversible after 5 weeks of recovery vacuolisation in 
chief cells at ≥30 mg/kg/day in the 6-months study. Furthermore, cytoplasmic vacuolation and/or 
single-cell necrosis in chief cells of the parathyroid were observed at 180 mg/kg/day in the 1-month 
exploratory nephrotoxicity study in female rats. There were no exposure marginals (x 0.68) at NOAEL 
for parathyroid toxicity compared to human exposure at 150 mg/m2 BID. 
Toxicokinetic analyses were undertaken in all repeat-dose toxicology studies. Notably, in rats, plasma 
exposure was consistently higher in females than in males. In the 13-weeks study, the difference was 
2- to 3- fold, and in the longer-term study, there was a 2- to 8-fold difference. There were no 
significant differences between the genders in cynomolgus monkeys. Notably, sex-related differences 
in some Lonafarnib PK parameters, including bioavailability and exposure, were observed in both rats, 
monkeys and humans (see pharmacokinetic section). In the 13-weeks studies, no Cmax values were 
provided, and no AUC values were presented at the end of the studies, e.g. day 91 (AUC exposure 
values from day 57 was presented instead). In the rat 13-weeks study, plasma AUC exposure was 
approximately 2-fold higher at day 57 compared to day 1, while the opposite was seen in the 13-weeks 
monkey study at the high-dose (60 mg/kg/day) with an approximately 3-fold decrease in plasma AUC 
exposure at day 57 compared to day 1. Generally, in the repeat-dose toxicity studies (except males in 
the 1-year monkey study) there was a tendency of over proportional exposure with increasing doses. 
Two major metabolites (M26 and M33) have been identified in human plasma. As major metabolites 
may imply, a safety concern qualification of these metabolites should be assessed in toxicological 
studies. However, the applicant provides no information regarding the identification of any metabolites 
in toxicological studies. 
2.5.3.3.  Genotoxicity 
A complete package of genotoxicity studies in agreement with the ICH S2(R1) guideline, including tests 
for gene mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes, and micronuclei in 
vivo (mouse), has been conducted with lonafarnib. All tests were negative. Based on the results of the 
conducted genotoxicity studies, the overall conclusion is that lonafarnib does not have any genotoxic 
potential. 
Five different experiments on lonafarnib in the bacterial reverse-mutation assay were conducted. 
Lonafarnib did not increase the number of revertants in any of the studies; the outcome was negative. 
It is not understood why the experiment was repeated 5 times. It is noted that different batches of 
lonafarnib were investigated.  
Exposure in the in vivo test was not measured. No other study on the pharmacokinetic profile of mice 
was provided. Observations on marrow toxicity was observed in the study, indicating that the bone 
marrow was exposed. However, a weakness of the study is the lack of exposure measurements, which 
can be considered acceptable given the product charactereistics.

2.5.3.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. The Applicant has stated that other 
regulatory authorities have requested a carcinogenicity study to be submitted post-approval. No 
further discussion was provided. 
2.5.3.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Studies were conducted to evaluate the standard reproductive and developmental toxicity profile of 
lonafarnib: a segment I ‘fertility’ in male and female rats, one segment II ‘EFD’ study in rats and one in 
rabbits, and one segment III ‘prenatal/postnatal study in rats. The studies were stated to be GLP 
compliant, and the program is in accordance with ICH M3. In general, the studies are considered 
adequate and relevant for the evaluation of potential risk for humans. 
Male and female fertility 
The Applicant performed separate fertility studies in male and female rats. A pilot dose-finding 
combined male and female fertility study was conducted prior to the definitive studies. 
In the pilot study, animals were administered lonafarnib at 30, 90, 120, 180 mg/kg/day. These doses 
were not tolerated by the female animals and animals were found dead or euthanized in moribund 
condition in the 90 and 180 mg/kg dose groups. No NOAEL could be established in the females, and 
the dose levels were reduced to 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day in the definitive study. For the male study, 
the same high dose level as in the pilot study was used in the definitive study; dose levels 30, 90, and 
180 mg/kg/day. 
In female rats, the administration started 2 weeks prior to mating through gestational day 7. 
Administration of lonafarnib in female rats caused resorptions and an increase in post-implantation 
loss. There were no effects on the mating performance or fertility parameters in female animals at the 
highest tested dose of 60 mg/kg. This was also concluded in the pilot study with doses up to 180 
mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity and F1 litters was considered 10 mg/kg/day, this was 
agreed. Exposure of lonafarnib was not measured in the study. In the 6-month repeat-dose toxicity 
study, a dose of 15 mg/kg/day in female rats corresponded to 0.7 times the exposure observed in 
patients, based on AUC. 
Lonafarnib was administered 10 weeks prior to mating and through the cohabitation period in male 
rats. The administration of lonafarnib cause a dose-dependent decrease in fertility index and increase 
in both pre- and post-implantation loss. The NOAEL for the paternal toxicity and the F1 litters was 30 
mg/kg/day. Exposure of lonafarnib was not measured in the study. In the 3-months repeat dose 
toxicity study, 30 mg/kg/day in male rats corresponded to 0.8 times the exposure observed in 
patients, based on AUC. 
Embryo-foetal development 
Embryo-foetal development was investigated in GLP studies in rats and rabbits. A pilot, dose-range 
finding study in each species was also conducted before the definitive studies. 
In the definitive EFD-study in rats, the dose levels were reduced from 10, 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg/day 
in the pilot study to 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day due to 100 % early resorptions in the animals 
administered 60 and 120 mg/kg/day. Lonafarnib was administered during the period of organogenesis 
(GD6-17). Increased post-implantation loss was observed in the definitive study at the highest dose 
administered (30 mg/kg).  
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 35/140 
 
 
 
In the high dose group (30 mg/kg), administration of lonafarnib was related to uncommon findings 
such as red/black tab around the placenta, dark and/or swollen placenta, two of the foetuses had 
tissue connected to adjacent placenta, or an enlarged placenta were observed.  
An increased number of visceral malformations was observed in the high dose group (30 mg/kg). The 
findings consisted of a convoluted ureter and dilated ureter. The applicant considered both findings as 
non-related to the treatment since the number of observations was high also in the control group and 
that the number in the treated group was close to the historical control. This is not agreed upon. While 
historical controls are important, the main control is within the study where animals, handling of the 
animals, and the environment are the same. Since the incidence of a convoluted ureter and dilated 
ureter is higher in the high dose group compared with both the study control group and the historical 
control group, it is not possible to exclude that these effects are related to treatment. 
A supernumerary rib was observed in one foetus in the 15 mg/kg group and one in the 30 mg/kg 
group. In the control group, one foetus was observed with an absent rib. No other skeletal 
malformations were observed. Of the reported skeletal variations, an increased number of variations in 
the lumbar rib was observed in the high dose group. The finding was considered unrelated to the test 
item by the Applicant. It is, however not possible to exclude that this is a treatment-related effect, 
although the historical control data shows a higher number of affected litters. 
The historical control data was collected between 1999 and 2004; the EFD study was conducted in 
2004; the historical data could thus be considered representative.  
The NOAEL was set at 15 mg/kg/day. Exposure of lonafarnib was not measured in the study. In the 6-
month repeat-dose toxicity study, a dose of 15 mg/kg/day in female rats corresponded to 0.7 times 
the exposure observed in patients, based on AUC. 
In the definitive EFD-study in rabbits, the dose levels were slightly reduced from 30, 90, and 180 
mg/kg/day in the pilot study to 10, 40, and 120 mg/kg/day due to maternal toxicity at 180 mg/kg and 
increase in post-implantation losses at all doses. Lonafarnib was administered through the period of 
organogenesis (GD7-19). 
In the high dose group (120 mg/kg) four animals were euthanized before the scheduled sacrifice. It is 
stated that it was due to observation of hairball in the stomach and that it was unrelated to the test 
item. There was no pathological report stating that the presence of a hairball was the cause of the 
assumed moribund status. It cannot be excluded that the moribund status was test-article related, also 
as inhibition of gastric emptying by lonafarnib was observed in a safety pharmacology study. 
Increased post-implantation loss was observed in the definitive study at the highest dose administered 
(120 mg/k) but also at the lower dose levels, including the lowest level (10 mg/kg).  
The placental findings observed in the rat study was not observed in the rabbit study. 
There were no foetal external or foetal visceral findings that could be related to the exposure of 
lonafarnib. Skeletal malformations and variations were observed in all treated groups. Findings were 
observed in the cranium, thoracic and lumbar vertebra and hyoid wing. 
The historical control data was collected between 1998 and 2003, the EFD study was conducted in 
2003; the historical data could thus be considered representative.  
No NOAEL could be established. The exposure following the lowest administered dose, 10 mg/kg, 
corresponds to 0.6 times the exposure observed in patients, based on AUC.

Prenatal and postnatal development 
Lonafarnib was administered orally to pregnant rats during organogenesis, parturition, and lactation at 
doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. A decrease in body weight was observed in the F0 animals in the high dose 
group (20 mg/kg). There were no treatment-related effects noted in the F1 and F2 generations. The 
proposed maternal NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day and ≥20 mg/kg/day for the F1 pups are accepted. The 
exposure or transfer to milk was not measured in the study. 14C-SCH-66336-derived radioactivity was 
transferred into the milk following a single oral dose of 30 mg 14C-SCH 66336/kg suspension. 
Compared to dam rats, nursing pups were exposed to low amounts of drug-derived radioactivity with a 
plasma AUC of 1.76%.  
In the reproductive performance of the F1 generation, it was noted that the animals in the 20 mg/kg 
group had 4.0 days prior to mating, vs 2.6 in the control group. The applicant considers this not test 
article related since no effects on other parameters were observed (mating, fertility and conception 
indices). In historical control data, the mean number of days prior to mating has been between 1.8 and 
4.7. 
Juvenile toxicity 
No juvenile toxicity studies were conducted, although lonafarnib is intended for children. The lack of 
juvenile toxicity studies has previously been agreed upon. In addition, the age of the animals in the 
toxicological studies corresponded to human ages from approximately 12 years and older and did not 
cover the ages of the intended paediatric patients (from 12 months and older).  
2.5.3.6.  Other toxicity studies 
No studies have been conducted with lonafarnib regarding local tolerance, antigenicity, 
immunotoxicity, dependence, and metabolites. This is considered acceptable. 
Impurities 
Compound W is a manufacturing intermediate and also a degradation product of the lonafarnib drug 
substance and is observed in stability studies of the drug product. The potential genotoxicity of 
Compound W was investigated in a micronucleus assay in mice.  
Compound W was together with two other impurities of Lonafarnib drug substance investigated in a 
repeat dose toxicity study in rats. The impurities with proposed specification limits were compound W 
(≤1.4 %), Des-10-bromo (≤0.30 %), and chiral impurity (≤2.0 %). 
Ethylbenzene is used in stage 1 of the lonafarnib drug substance manufacturing procedure. A 
toxicological evaluation to justify the set threshold of 273 ppm was provided. 
Five genotoxic impurities have been identified (Compound II, JJ-4a, JJ-4b, JJ-5a, and JJ-5b). 
Specifications are adopted at 20 ppm, based on TTC value of 30 µg/day intake for >1 to 10 years.  
Phototoxicity 
Lonafarnib gives a UV spectrum with a peak maximum at approximately 295 nm. Although the molar 
extinction coefficient at the peak at 295 nm is not specified, it does not seem likely that it would 
exceed 1000 L mol-1 cm-1, and can thus be considered not sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct 
phototoxicity.   
2.5.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Lonafarnib PEC surface-water value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022

The log Kow is >4.5, and further assessment of persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity is 
necessary. The tests outlined in Phase II Tier A should be performed in the order persistence-
bioaccumulation-toxicity.  
The Applicant has provided an assessment that was not based on eco toxicological data. Instead, the 
assessment relies on QSAR data and discussion on the toxicological studies. The Applicant concludes 
that lonafarnib should be treated as a PBT substance and that further definitive testing is not required 
due to the ultra-rare indication with potentially very few patients in the EU. This is not acceptable. Due 
to the persistence, bioaccumulation, and ecotoxicity of a PBT substance, an accumulation in the 
environment and in biota with possible long-term effects cannot be excluded, regardless of the 
predicted environmental concentration. The Applicant is asked to perform an experimentally PBT 
assessment for lonafarnib in a step-wise procedure for persistence (OECD 308) - bioaccumulation 
(OECD 305) – toxicity. The Applicant has committed to conduct the requested studies. The results will 
be submitted post-approval as soon as possible but no later than the end of 2025.  
2.5.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Most of the documentation in the non-clinical file originate from previous development for oncology 
indications, which were not conducted by the Applicant. As a result the data are quite old and 
descriptions very brief in parts. This is especially true in the section on non-clinical pharmacology, 
where in the initial application, no studies on in vivo models of progeria had been conducted with 
Lonafarnib. Instead, data on progeria models with other farnesyltransferase inhibitors were presented 
and supplemented with data from in vivo studies with lonafarnib in an oncology model. However, 
during the procedure, the Applicant provided additional results from a prepublication by Yale 
university, deriving from a study with lonafarnib in a mouse model of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria 
Syndrome. 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
The IC50 of 1.9 nM, obtained from the biochemical inhibition test of human farnesyl protein 
transferase (FPT) with farnesylation of H-Ras-CVLS, was sufficient in order to progress further into 
cellular and in vivo studies. However, in vitro studies have not been conducted to compare the potency 
of lonafarnib for farnesyl protein transferases across species. The lack of in vitro potency comparison 
between species was justified by referring to data showing that the amino acid sequence was highly 
conserved between humans and the relevant nonclinical species rat, mouse, rabbit and monkey. Given 
the high degree of high amino acid sequence identity, the Applicant anticipated a low likelihood of 
marked differences in potency. This is considered acceptable.  
The ability of lonafarnib to dose-dependently reduce nuclear blebbing in a cellular assay with progerin 
transfected HeLa cells or HGPS dermal fibroblasts is encouraging since the progerin accumulation in 
HGPS typically is associated with such a disturbing nuclear architecture thought to be involved in the 
cause of the clinical manifestations of HGPS and the related forms of PL. In addition, it was found that 
progerin is not alternatively geranylgeranylated when farnesylation is inhibited. This was in contrast to 
some other substrates of farnesyl transferase, K- and N-Ras, that, upon treatment with FTIs, are 
alternatively prenylated by geranylgeranyl transferase-1. The importance of this finding is agreed. 
Supportive data on additional patient-derived fibroblast cultures from HGPS and PL is also presented in 
reports (John Hopkins and Wuxi) in the clinical documentation. In response to a question, it was 
substantiated that the cellular materials used in the study by Capell et al. (2005) and the John Hopkins 
and the Wuxi studies were not obtained from HGPS patients in clinical study Prolon1 or Pronlon2. 
However, cellular material from two patients with processing mutations, 4371 (PSADFN318) and 4729 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 38/140 
 
 
 
(PSADFN317), deriving from the 09-06-0298 study (Group 1), was included in both the Johns Hopkins 
and Wuxi studies. Mutation details, participation in clinical studies and outcome were provided for 
these two patients. 
During the procedure, the Applicant provided additional results by Yale university, which shows non-
clinical proof of concept, i.e. how lonafarnib in a mouse model of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria 
Syndrome prolonged survival and improved cardiovascular function. Before these results were 
provided, no studies on in vivo models of progeria had been conducted with Lonafarnib. Instead, data 
from in vivo studies with lonafarnib in an oncology model was presented. Lonafarnib demonstrated 
anti-tumour activity in a dose-dependent manner in the xeno- and syngeneic tumour models in nude 
mice that were transplanted with human carcinoma cell lines containing mutated K- or H-ras isoforms. 
The value of these studies in bridging lonafarnib from in vitro to in vivo efficacy is agreed. However, it 
should be noted that the value of mouse tumour models with long-term cultured cell lines is of limited 
value when estimating the effect within the oncology field. In other words, human cell lines that have 
been through several passages and cultured for a long-term may have changed over time, including in 
the pathway of interest. 
In light of the sparse clinical data due to the extremely rare disease (HGPS and PL), there is 
encouraging in vivo pharmacology data (Fong et al., 2005) on the FTI ABT-100. The use of ABT-100 to 
support the in vivo proof of concept was justified by its similarity to lonafarnib. The pharmacokinetics 
of lonafarnib and ABT-100 appear to be comparable as determined from exposure after a similar oral 
dose; however, the ABT-100 is 20 times more potent (0.05 vs 1.9 nM). Therefore, the relevance of the 
data based on treatment with ABT-100 as initial non-clinical proof of concept for the less potent 
lonafarnib was questioned. Thus, before the study with lonafarnib on LmnaG609G/G609G mice was 
provided, non-clinical in vivo proof of concept of the efficacy of lonafarnib itself was considered 
missing. However, with the additional data showing prolonged survival and improved cardiovascular 
function in a mouse model of progeria, the clinical efficacy of lonafarnib is considered supported by 
non-clinical data.  
In ZMPSTE24-deficient mice, in the study by Fong et al. 2005, the ZMPSTE24-deficiency should lead to 
the inability to cleave off the farnesylated end from lamin A, leading to accumulation of progerin in the 
nuclear lamina. The progerin accumulation results in disturbed nuclear morphology (blebbing). By 
treating with FTI (ABT-100), the production of farnesylated lamin A should be reduced, leading to a 
reduction of progerin accumulation in the nuclear membrane and thus, less blebbing. If it is true, the 
disturbed nuclear membrane is linked to the other phenotypic changes observed in this mouse model; 
it is surprising that the observed normalizations of, e.g. grip strength, bone abnormalities and 
mortality, were not directly associated with the observed degree of disturbed nuclear morphology. 
However, the ZMPSTE24-deficient mice treated with FTI did not display a complete elimination of 
diseased phenotype, which the Applicant suggests can play a role in the absence of direct association 
between improved nuclear morphology and phenotype improvements. The Applicant also clarifies it is 
not claiming that treatment with lonafarnib produces a direct and measurable relationship between the 
degree of reduction in misshapen nuclei and the magnitude of improvement in the signs and/or 
symptoms of Progeria.  Due to the complexity provided by the broad and diverse roles lamin A plays in 
cellular functions, there are challenges associated with linking the degree of nuclear deformity and 
phenotype severity. It is also possible that phenotype severity is influenced by more than the 
deleterious effects of prelamin A or mutant variants on nuclear shape, potentially explaining why 
mutations affecting the same pathway result in different clinical phenotypes. Additionally, nuclear 
morphology in fibroblasts does not necessarily represent precisely what is going on in tissues. 
Furthermore, the Applicant put forward that in their Progeroid Laminopathy White Paper, there is 
clearly a correlation between phenotypic improvement with lonafarnib treatment in humans and 
decreased numbers of fibroblasts with abnormal nuclear morphology. Similar observations are made in 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 39/140 
 
 
 
previously published studies of other fanesyltransferase inhibitors in ZMPSTE24-deficient mice and 
cultured fibroblasts from the same animals. The Applicant suggests that improved nuclear morphology 
is a proven marker for FTI's beneficial effects on animals, including humans. 
From the study of the cardiovascular disease in a transgenic C608G LMNA mouse model of progeria the 
Applicant concluded, these data indicate that tipifarnib can improve the cardiovascular phenotype when 
treatment is initiated at weaning; the significantly improved cardiovascular parameters are suggestive 
of disease regression in this HGPS mouse model that mimics human vascular disease; and the nearly 
normal phenotype is indicative of the fact that FTIs may induce disease regression in mice that already 
manifest phenotypic changes with early treatment. It is agreed, that these data generated with 
tipifarnib are encouraging, supporting a pharmacodynamic FTI effect on a progerin accumulation 
induced cardiovascular damage similar to what is observed in HGPS. 
From the study on the Hepatitis D Virus (HDV) model, carried out with two prenylation inhibitors FTI-
277 and FTI-2153, the Applicant concludes that it is expected although not examined in this study that 
Lonafarnib would show similar effects as other prenylation inhibitors based on a common mechanism 
of action. It is agreed that this may not be an unlikely scenario, considering the demonstrated anti-
viral effect by Lonafarnib in vitro. However, it is acknowledged, an in vivo effect by treatment with 
lonafarnib in this model has not yet been shown.  
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Inhibition of farnesyltransferase by lonafarnib could potentially impact other farnesylated proteins. In 
general, these proteins tend to be involved in the promotion of cell growth and division, except for the 
HDJ proteins, which serve as co-chaperones and stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70; RRP22, which 
inhibits cell growth; and the prostacyclin receptor, which plays a negative role in platelet aggregation 
and vasodilation. Given the functions of farnesylated proteins in cell growth and division, potentially 
clinically relevant effects would be on proliferating cells, such as those in the bone marrow (a known 
effect for this class of compounds). In addition, there are local effects on the gastrointestinal system. 
The most frequent adverse events observed with lonafarnib, as mild diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, and depressed serum haemoglobin, may be related to the bone marrow or gastrointestinal 
tract. Therefore, some of the most frequently seen adverse events may theoretically result from the 
inhibition of cell proliferation in these tissues. 
Safety pharmacology 
The safety pharmacology of lonafarnib was evaluated by targeting a range of endpoints, which is 
appreciated. However, only the dog Purkinje fibre study (Quintiles, SN 02160) appeared to be 
conducted under GLP compliance. The CNS and hERG assays were not conducted under GLP 
compliance as required in current guidelines since these studies were performed at the time prior to 
ICH S7A finalization, and therefore, GLP compliance cannot be expected. 
Regarding safety pharmacology, there is no clear signal of QTc prolongation for the cardiovascular 
system from the non-clinical studies, while in the clinic, QTc prolongation has been observed. It is not 
known if lonafarnib affects other cardiac ion channels (e.g. NaV 1.5) that could explain the findings in 
patients. There were no lonafarnib related effects of concern on the nervous system observed in safety 
pharmacology experimental models.  
No stand-alone safety pharmacology study was performed regarding respiratory function, which is not 
according to the current guideline since lonafarnib is not a highly selective biotechnology product. 
However, the assessment of respiratory safety pharmacology for lonafarnib was also conducted prior to 
the finalization of ICH S7A (2000) [CPMP/ICH/539/00]. Therefore, when this study was conducted, it 
was considered an appropriate option to evaluate this endpoint by including an assessment of 
respiratory function through the measurement of respiratory rate in the design of the GLP repeat-dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 40/140 
 
 
 
toxicity studies in monkeys. This is acknowledged. Moreover, no abnormalities were observed in 
respiratory function in patients over the treatment period. 
A pharmacokinetic evaluation was not performed in any of the in vivo safety pharmacology studies 
conducted with lonafarnib. This is a clear weakness for the interpretation of data and e.g. establishing 
exposure margins. However, based on measurements from the toxicity studies, the calculated margins 
to clinical exposure was x7 for the gastrointestinal effects, with the same dose (and calculated 
margin), no effect on the nervous system was observed. No effect on respiration rate was observed at 
5-6 times the clinical Cmax.  
It should also be noted that there is a question regarding two major human metabolites (M26 and 
M33) in the pharmacokinetic section. It is currently not known whether these metabolites are of 
relevance regarding safety pharmacological considerations. 
Non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted and were not 
warranted since off-target screening did not reveal any concern for pharmacodynamic interactions. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Relevant non-clinical studies to characterise the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of 
Lonafarnib and its major metabolites were performed in non-clinical species. The bioanalytical methods 
used for quantification of Lonafarnib in plasma in the pivotal toxicity studies of rats, rabbits and 
monkeys were stated to have been validated according to GLP requirements. The bioanalytical HPLC-
UV methods used for quantification of Lonafarnib in plasma in the pivotal toxicity studies of rats, 
rabbits and monkeys (i.e. Studies SN02160, SN96030, SN96612, SN96034, SN96036, SN94046) are 
claimed to have been validated according to GLP standard. However, it is unclear if the method 
validations included in these study reports were formally performed under GLP. The Applicant was 
asked to provide information on the GLP aspects in the above-mentioned studies and discuss the 
potential impact on the TK analysis of the samples collected from these GLP studies. The applicant 
confirmed in the response that all plasma sample bioanalyses across all pivotal toxicity studies were 
conducted according to GLP regulations using validated methods. Thus, there was no potential impact 
on the TK analysis of samples collected in the GLP studies. 
Furthermore, no validated GLP compliant bioanalytical methods were developed for plasma exposure 
measurement of Lonafarnib in the definitive rat embryofoetal development (EFD) study (SN02292) and 
in the definite rat pre- and postnatal development toxicity (PPND) study (SN96047). This is 
understandable since no samples for analysis were obtained in the studies. Thus, no TK analysis has 
been performed in these two pivotal toxicity studies. The Applicant was asked to justify the absence of 
TK assessment in these pivotal toxicity studies and discuss the possible consequences for the non-
clinical safety evaluation of Lonafarnib. The Applicant responded that although exposure data in 
pregnant rats were not obtained in the pivotal rat reproductive toxicity studies for lonafarnib 
(SN02292, SN96047), exposure data are available from the GLP, 6-month toxicity study in rats at the 
same or similar dose levels as tested in the rat reproductive toxicity studies (see exposure data in the 
table below). As surrogate TK data are available to provide a comparative assessment of exposure, the 
lack of TK data in pregnant animals has a limited impact on the overall non-clinical safety evaluation of 
lonafarnib.

Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
The absorption of Lonafarnib was studied in vitro in Cacao cells and in vivo after single oral and 
intravenous dosing to rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Oral dosing is the intended route of 
administration in patients. There were clear sex-related differences in some PK parameters, including 
bioavailability and exposure in both rats and monkeys. For example, the mean plasma concentration 
and exposure were 3.3- and 5.5-fold greater in female than male rats following oral dosing of [14C]-
Lonafarnib (30 mg/kg). Following IV administration of [14C]-Lonafarnib (5 mg/kg), the clearance was 
2.66-fold faster in males, and the half-life was longer in female rats than in male rats (2.38 and 1.54 
hours, respectively), and exposure (AUC) was 2.6-fold higher in female rats. In addition, following 
repeat oral dosing in rats, the exposure was noticeably higher in females than males after 3- and 6-
months of daily administration (see TK data in toxicology section). The effect of gender on the 
Lonafarnib PK profile following oral administration in men was also assessed in healthy subjects in a 
clinical study (Study P02673). The AUC0-inf of lonafarnib was significantly higher (44%) in females as 
compared with males, whereas Cmax values were approximately 26% higher in females. The Applicant 
states that this difference is likely due to the faster clearance rate and the shorter half-life in male 
animals.  
The tissue distribution of Lonafarnib in pigmented rats and cynomolgus monkeys was determined 
following oral administration of [14C]-Lonafarnib. In the monkey WBA study, one animal was sacrificed 
at 4 hours and another after 28 days (SN00039). On Day 28, moderate levels of drug-derived 
radioactivity remained in the retina and liver, and low levels were detected in the adrenal gland, bone 
marrow, gall bladder, harderian gland, myocardium, GI wall, kidney, lymph node, salivary gland, skin, 
spleen, and stomach wall, indicating prolonged retention of 14C-Lonafarnib in these tissues. Moreover, 
only 78% of the administered dose was recovered at this time point. The Applicant was asked to 
discuss the possible mechanism of retention of radioactivity in these tissues and potential clinical 
relevance since the human AME study (P00260) also showed low recovery. The Applicant explained 
that the low recovery in the exploratory WBA study (SN00039, N=1) could be attributed to a more 
qualitative method of analysis as compared to the main WBA study (SN96559) in which >90% 
recovery was obtained. Therefore, this is considered a plausible explanation. 
In a phototoxicity study, Lonafarnib did not absorb light within the range of natural sunlight (290-700 
nm), indicating that Lonafarnib has a low potential for phototoxicity (see toxicology section). However, 
ocular toxicity findings were observed in the monkey following repeat oral dosing of Lonafarnib, 
yielding low exposure margins to the clinical exposure of Lonafarnib at the proposed human dose (see 
toxicology section). 
The Applicant states that Lonafarnib is secreted into the milk of lactating rats. However, no such data 
can be located. The Applicant was asked to submit the study report describing the Lonafarnib 
concentrations in milk. The Applicant submitted data concerning the transfer of drug-related activity 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 42/140 
 
 
 
 
into milk in rats to support the wording in section 4.6 of the SmPC. The data indicate that 14C-SCH  
66336-derived radioactivity was transferred into the milk of lactating, 12-day postpartum (dam) rats 
following a single oral dose of 30 mg 14C-SCH 66336/kg suspension. Nursing pups were exposed to 
low amounts of drug-derived radioactivity with a plasma AUC of 1.76% compared to dam rats. 
The metabolite profile of Lonafarnib was determined in mouse, rat, monkey, and human hepatocytes in 
vitro and in rats and monkeys following oral dosing in vivo. The most common metabolic pathways 
across species, including humans, included oxidation, dehydrogenation, and/or a combination of these 
two processes, and the majority of metabolites across all species were associated with changes in the 
region of the pendant piperidine ring. However, there are no data on in vitro metabolism of Lonafarnib 
in the rabbit. Since the rabbit is used in embryo-foetal developmental (EFD) studies, these data may 
be of importance. The Applicant was initially asked to justify why no metabolism data in the rabbit had 
been presented. Whereas the Applicant acknowledged that in vitro metabolism data in rabbits is 
potentially supportive, such data are not considered critical for evaluation of the results obtained with 
rabbits in the non-clinical toxicity program. Lonafarnib has been shown to be pharmacologically active 
in rabbits, and the TK profile was similar across species, including rabbits, rats and monkeys. 
Therefore, the justification for the lack of metabolism data in rabbits is acceptable. 
No human specific metabolite appears to have been detected in vitro or in vivo studies. Two major 
metabolites, M26 (MM33; RM25; SCH 629153) and M33 (MM38; RM30; SCH 441746), were identified 
in human plasma. M26 was formed by adding oxygen to the pendant piperidine ring, and M33, was 
formed by dehydrogenation, representing 15.1% and 13.9% of total plasma radioactivity detected 8 
hours post-dose in humans, respectively. As major metabolites may imply, a safety concern 
qualification of these metabolites should be assessed in toxicological studies. However, the Applicant 
initially provided no data regarding identifying any metabolites in the toxicity studies. In response to 
this question, the Applicant provided estimated exposure data for Lonafarnib and the two major human 
metabolites, M26 and M33 in rats and monkeys. The calculated exposure margins were lower in rats 
than in humans, with margins of 0.43 to 0.50 and approximately 0.19 for M26 and M33, respectively. 
In monkeys, on the other hand, exposure to major human metabolites was slightly higher than that in 
humans, with exposure margins of 1.11 to 1.18 and 1.33 to 1.47 for M26 and M33, respectively. The 
two major human metabolites, M26 and M33, have been sufficiently qualified in the pivotal repeat-dose 
toxicity studies, including monkeys. In the rat toxicity studies, mainly the M33 is lower than 50% of 
the human exposure. Since monkeys were not used in the pivotal EFD studies, the low exposure of 
M33 in rats is uncertain which may impact the results and conclusion of the reproductive toxicity 
studies. However, since Lonafarnib has shown reproductive toxicity in animals, demonstrating 
teratogenic potential at clinically relevant exposures, the current recommendation in section 4.6 of the 
SmPC is considered sufficient.  
In summary, the overall non-clinical pharmacokinetic characterisation of Lonafarnib is considered 
acceptable. 
Toxicology 
The Sprague Dawley rat and cynomolgus monkey were selected as the main rodent and non-rodent 
species in the general toxicity studies. Sprague Dawley rat and New Zeeland White rabbits were 
selected for reproduction and developmental studies. The Applicant has not provided a detailed 
justification of the selected species but shortly commented that the selection was based on the 
pharmacological relevance of the target and the pharmacokinetic profile. Therefore, the Applicant was 
in the first round of the procedure, asked to provide a thorough discussion to further justify the 
selection of the chosen species for the toxicological program. The Applicant described that farnesyl 
protein transferases are highly conserved across species and anticipate that the same is true for the 
pharmacological activity. While this is possible, no supporting data was presented. The observations in 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 43/140 
 
 
 
the toxicological studies have not been described as pharmacological effects. The Applicant further 
claims that the pharmacokinetic profile supports the selected species as relevant. However, no 
comparison to the pharmacokinetic profile in humans was made. The issue is not further pursued. 
The Applicant has provided a comparison of animal and human systemic exposure. Human AUC values 
used for the interspecies comparison are based on AUC0-12h from an article by Gordon et al. 2012, 
whereas the animal AUC values from the repeat-dose studies are based on AUC0-24h. When 
comparing animal AUC0-24h values with human AUC0-12 values, it provides an incorrect picture of the 
real ratio of animal to human exposure. Therefore, the Applicant was asked to recalculate the 
interspecies comparison using human AUC0-24 values and discuss the new animal to human exposure 
ratios, especially regarding the adequacy of the exposure margins or provide an acceptable justification 
for the current strategy.   The Applicant has provided recalculations of the previously presented 
exposure margins. Generally, the recalculation reduces the exposure margins of 40%, and it should be 
clearly stated that ratio values < 1 represent a lack of exposure margins to human clinical exposure.  
Single-dose toxicity 
Both the single-dose oral gavage studies and the IP injection studies in mice was conducted twice. The 
two oral gavage single-dose studies in mice (SN97266 and SN96027) appear to be identical, and the 
two IP single-dose studies (SN96028 and SN97267) only appear to differ by the exclusion of the 200 
mg/kg dose group in the second IP study conducted (SN97267). In the first single-dose IP study 
(SN96028), extremely high mortality was observed in the 1000 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg dose groups 
(10/10 and 8/10, respectively); however, these doses were still included in the second repeated IP 
study (SN97267), whereas, the 200 mg/kg dose determined as the NOAEL was excluded. Additionally, 
no discussion comparing the results from the different studies were provided, even though 
discrepancies in the reproducibility of the study results concerning NOAELs in the oral gavage studies 
and NOAELs, MTDs and LD50s in the IP studies were noted. During the procedure, the Applicant was 
asked, from a 3R perspective, to justify a) the reason for repeating the oral gavage study and b) the 
choice of IP route for administration when the intended clinical route is PO and the selection of doses 
for the second IP study conducted. 
Additionally, a discussion of the potential reasons for the differences in NOAELs, LD50s and MTDs 
values in the studies should be included. The Applicant emphasised that the single-dose studies were 
conducted by Merck (Schering), and Eiger, therefore, has limited information regarding study design 
and conduct. The Applicant has, therefore, only sparsely addressed the issues. The repetition of the 
oral gavage study in mice was assumed to be related to GLP issues, whether the repetition of the IP 
study was more unclear. The choice of IP as the route of administration in two studies was suggested 
to support the mouse micronucleus assay (Study SN 96049) and potential efficacy models, which is 
considered a plausible explanation. The requested discussions on the difference in NOAEL, LD50 and 
MTD values were brief. However, as single-dose toxicity studies are not pivotal for approval of the MAA 
and the Applicant only seems to have limited information regarded these studies, there does not seem 
to be any point in further pursuing these issues. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies, multiple organs/tissues were affected. Primarily, these included liver, 
male reproductive organs (testes and epididymides), lymphoid organs/tissues, haematopoietic system 
(bone marrow) and immune organs but also female reproductive organs, gastrointestinal system, eye, 
adrenal glands and parathyroid. No NOAEL could be established in any of the studies. Most of the 
toxicity occurred at no or very low exposure marginals compared to that in the clinic, with the intended 
dosing at 150 mg/m2 BID.  
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 44/140 
 
 
 
In the 3-months oral gavage study in rats, findings suggestive of renal toxicity and/or altered 
calcium/phosphorus metabolism, reabsorption, and/or excretion were observed. The Applicant was 
asked to discuss further the consequence and clinical relevance of these findings, especially the altered 
calcium/phosphorus homeostasis. 
Evidence of renal toxicity and altered calcium/phosphorus metabolism were seen at doses ≥30 
mg/kg/day in the 6-month rat study. The NOAEL for kidney toxicity in rats were therefore 15 
mg/kg/day in both sexes, with the end of study AUC0-24 of 2.31 μg•h/mL in males and 14.1 μg•h/mL in 
females. This should be compared to a mean human AUC0-24 of 36 μg•h/mL, corresponding to 
exposures of ~ 0.06-to 0.39-fold, respectively, concluding that renal toxicity in rats was detected at 
exposures much lower than clinically relevant exposure. Even though nephrotoxic changes were not 
seen in the monkeys, the rat findings could potentially indicate a clinically relevant effect on kidney 
and bones in humans. This was, however, according to the Applicant, sufficiently addressed in the 
clinical studies (ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group) where no clear or consistent pattern of changes 
in clinical chemistry measures from baseline to the end of therapy suggested an adverse drug effect on 
kidney function or bone. However, low alkaline phosphatase was detected in two patients (3.2%), and 
two patients (3.2%) showed high calcium. 
Mortality occurred in two monkeys and two rats after treatment with lonafarnib at doses corresponding 
to 3.3 and 21-fold higher exposure, respectively, compared to the intended clinical dose of 150 mg/m2. 
In the first round of the procedure, the Applicant was asked to further discuss the mortality in 
cynomolgus monkeys in relation to the low exposure marginals and potential consequences for the 
clinic. In response, the Applicant described that the acute morbidity of these two monkeys given 60 
mg/kg/day (720 mg/m2/day) was caused by loss of blood (haemorrhages in multiple organs attributed 
to severe thrombocytopenia), hypovolemia, and stress. Clinical pathology and necropsy findings in 
these moribund monkeys were generally consistent with those expected with dehydration, diarrhoea, 
blood loss, exudative loss, and stress. The Applicant argued that the mortalities observed in monkeys 
are of low consequence for humans since preventive measures are available to preclude the 
development of consequences for GI-related effects. This part is acceptable. The Applicant did not 
further discuss the mortality in cynomolgus monkeys in relation to the low exposure marginals and 
potential consequences for the clinic but points out that haemorrhage in multiple organs was observed 
in the deceased monkeys. This finding has been included in the SmPC.  
In both rats and cynomolgus monkeys, toxicity occurred in the liver characterised by hepatic 
dysfunction and a pathologic response to increased metabolic stress through enzyme induction, 
increased weight, hypertrophy and vacuolation with no exposure marginals at NOAEL. Notably, altered 
liver enzymes levels have been monitored after lonafarnib treatment in the clinic. 
Male reproductive organs (testes and epididymides) were affected in both rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys after administration with lonafarnib for 3 months or 1 year, respectively. Generally, the 
toxicity included decreased testes weight and atrophy, aspermia or oligospermia and spermatogonial 
debris with apparently profound effects on fertility as observed in the rat FEED study. No specific 
studies regarding the potential mechanism behind the observed toxicity in male reproduction organs 
have been conducted. The Applicant has, however, provided a discussion regarding the potential 
mechanisms behind the toxicity. In the scientific literature, studies suggest that the inhibition of 
farnesyl protein transferase and subsequent farnesylation of proteins at the C-terminal CaaX box are 
likely to have downstream effects on male reproductive health. Also, the inhibition of pathways studied 
in cancer cells, namely that lonafarnib prevents the farnesylation of ras proteins and other farnesyl 
transferase substrates, such as the nuclear centromere-associated proteins CENP-E and CENP-F, the 
nuclear lamin prelamin A, the co-chaperone protein HDJ-2, may also have implications for male 
reproductive health. Thus, at least two pathways have been discussed as mechanisms behind the 
toxicity observed in male reproductive organs. It is possible that both pathways can be involved. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 45/140 
 
 
 
clinical implications were only very briefly discussed. At present, it is not known if treatment with 
lonafarnib has any impact on pubertal development or fertility in humans. 
Ocular findings of single-cell necrosis of rods and cones in the retina were observed in the monkeys but 
not in the rats. A mechanistic electroretinography (ERG) study in monkeys concluded that the extent of 
the changes corresponded to an impairment of night vision. Furthermore, clinical signs of GI 
disturbances were noted in both species but especially pronounced in the monkeys. 
Toxicokinetic analyses were undertaken in all repeat-dose toxicology studies. In both the 3-months 
and 6-months repeat-dose study in rats, a difference in systemic exposure between males and 
females, with a consistently higher systemic exposure in females, were observed.  The difference in 
exposure corresponded to sex-dependent metabolic differences observed in rats related to the 
expression of hepatic enzymes with approximately a 10-fold greater level of expression of sex-specific 
cytochrome P450s such as CYP2C11, CYP2C13, and CYP3A2. As lonafarnib is primarily metabolized by 
CYP3A, it is likely that the differences seen in exposure in rats for lonafarnib could be attributed to 
hepatic enzyme expression. According to the Applicant, a similar picture was also seen in humans, 
where a higher exposure was detected in females compared to male patients.  
In the rat and monkey 13-week-studies, no exposure was presented at the end of the studies (day 
91). Exposure data were presented on days 1 and 57. The Applicant argues that a steady-state was 
achieved, and the potential effects on CYP enzymes would be similar. Since the exposure margins to 
clinical exposure in most of the studies were below 1, the representativeness of the day 57 data is 
considered acceptable. 
In humans, two major metabolites (H17/M26 and HM21/M33) have been identified. The metabolites 
were tested for farnesyl transferase inhibition, and HM21/M33 was found to have pharmacological 
activity similar to that of the parent drug (lonafarnib). No secondary pharmacodynamics studies have 
been conducted for the H17/M26 metabolite since it cannot be stably synthesized. However, the 
Applicant provided initially no information whether plasma exposure of the two human major 
metabolites has been assessed in pivotal toxicological studies. In response to this question, the 
Applicant submitted estimated exposure data for Lonafarnib and the two major human metabolites, 
M26 and M33, in rats and monkeys (see details in the Pharmacokinetics section above). 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Regarding genotoxicity, the in vivo study (Mouse micronucleus test), was performed at dose levels 
corresponding to doses lower than the clinically relevant doses.  
Following the Scientific Advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/25263/2019), no carcinogenicity studies are 
considered needed before marketing authorisation approval. Based on the available data, lonafarnib is 
not considered genotoxic, and no preneoplastic lesions were observed in repeated dose toxicity studies 
within the tested dose regimen. Furthermore, the 26-week rat study findings indicate that exposures 
around or below the intended clinical exposure would be suitable in a study of longer duration. Given 
the lack of apparent concerns and based on the limited life expectancy of the patients and the 
feasibility of conducting a long-term animal study, carcinogenicity studies are also not considered 
needed post-approval. The Applicant has however accepted the request from other regulatory 
authorities to conduct a carcinogenicity study and will submit the results of the CARC studies no later 
than the first quarter of 2024.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In the embryo-foetal development study in rats in the high dose group (30 mg/kg), administration of 
lonafarnib was related to uncommon findings such as red/black tab around the placenta, dark and/or 
swollen placenta, two of the foetuses had tissue connected to adjacent placenta, or an enlarged 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 46/140 
 
 
 
placenta were observed. There is no explanation for these findings. The placental findings were not 
observed in the rabbit study. In the first round of the procedure, the Applicant was asked to discuss 
possible mechanisms for these findings. The Applicant has presented possible explanations for the 
placental findings in the rat as reviewed by Furukawa et al. No discussion on a possible mechanism 
based on the pharmacological effect of lonafarnib was provided. At the same dose at which these 
placental findings were observed, the increased post-implantation loss was observed. Furthermore, an 
increased number of visceral variations were observed. The Applicant’s conclusion that there was no 
correlation with foetal development is thus not agreed upon. Although no clarification of the placental 
findings can be expected at this stage, the totality of data remains to support the recommendation that 
lonafarnib is not recommended in pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective 
contraception. 
In section 4.6 of the SmPC, upon request by the CHMP, the Applicant has included a recommendation 
and justification regarding how long after the final dose effective contraception should be used. The 
Applicant initially proposed that effective methods of contraception should be used 3 months after 
cessation of treatment in females of childbearing potential and sexually active males. The justification 
was based on data from male studies only. The proposed time for effective contraception for males is 
acceptable. For women, a shorter period should be recommended. There were no effects on the mating 
performance or fertility parameters in female animals in the fertility studies in rats. Furthermore, in 
healthy adult volunteers, the t1/2 was 5.6 h after 75 mg of lonafarnib, twice daily for 5 days. The PK 
appears similar in healthy volunteers and the patient population although the predictive performance 
of the model is poor. Despite the uncertainties, the t1/2 of 5.6 h could be used to estimate a relevant 
time period after dosing during which effective contraceptives are recommended. Thus, one week is 
deemed a sufficiently safe margin to ensure no remaining lonafarnib residues at the time of a potential 
conception.  
No juvenile toxicity studies were conducted, although lonafarnib is in this application intended for 
children. The lack of juvenile toxicity studies has previously been agreed upon. In addition, the age of 
the animals in the toxicological studies corresponded to human ages from approximately 12 years and 
older and did not cover the ages of the intended paediatric patients (from 12 months and older). As 
requested by PDCO and in a previous scientific advice the Applicant has discussed the target organs of 
particular relevance to children, the liver, kidney testicles and retina. Further discussion provided upon 
request in the first round of the procedure did not include any specific discussion regarding developing 
organs. Since farnesylated proteins are involved in cell growth and division, potentially clinically 
relevant effects would be on proliferating cells. 
Impurities 
Lonafarnib with 1% of compound W was investigated in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice. An 
increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in female animals. The Applicant 
considers these findings not likely to be test article-related. The conclusion that the study outcome was 
negative is acceptable since the results were not reproducible in independent scoring of replicate 
slides. It is, however, not agreed that, based on the provided information, Compound W could be 
considered non-genotoxic. In the conducted study, Compound W was only 1% of the administered test 
item. To better investigate the genotoxic potential of Compound W, the substance itself should have 
been tested and preferably in a bacterial reverse mutation assay. The quality section of the file states 
that Compound W is non-mutagenic according to ICH M7 compliant QSAR test. The QSAR analysis 
report was submitted upon request in the first round of the procedure. The assessment included a 
statistical and an expert-rule based methodology. It is agreed that Compound W can be considered 
non-mutagenic. 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 47/140 
 
 
 
The repeat-dose toxicity study in rats investigated a mixture of the drug substance impurities 
Compound W, Des-10-bromo and chiral impurity for daily oral gavage dose for 28 days. The high-dose 
mixture was considered the NOAEL, which is accepted. 
The high-dose group received the following amounts of the impurities: 
Compound W, 0.613 mg/kg/day 
Des-10-bromo, 0.131 mg/kg/day 
Chiral impurity, 1.758 mg/kg/day 
The Applicant has provided a clarification on how the investigated doses in the toxicity study correlate 
with the proposed qualification levels of Compound W, Des-10-bromo, and chiral impurity. From these 
calculations, based on the calculations and the maximum daily dose of 200 mg, compound W can be 
considered qualified up to 0.9 %. The proposed drug substance specification limit of ≤0.30 % can thus 
be acceptable from a toxicological point of view. The proposed limits in the drug product is 0.5% 
(release) and 0.6% (stability) are also acceptable from a toxicological viewpoint.  
Regarding the des-10-bromo impurity and based on the calculations and the maximum daily dose of 
200 mg, the des-10-bromo impurity can be considered qualified up to 0.2 %. The proposed drug 
substance specification limit of ≤0.30 % can thus not be considered qualified from a non-clinical 
aspect. Also, with the more liberal way of calculating with the 150 mg daily dose, the qualified level 
(0.26%) does not reach the proposed specification limits.  
Based on the calculations and the maximum daily dose of 200 mg, the chiral impurity can be 
considered qualified up to 1.30%. The proposed drug substance specification limit of ≤2.0 % can thus 
not be considered qualified from a non-clinical perspective. When calculating with the more common 
daily dose of 150 mg the qualified level is 1.70 % and does not reach the proposed specification limits.  
Thus, according to the calculations the specification limits for Des-10-Bromo and the chiral impurity 
could be considered qualified up to 0.2% and 1.3%. However, it is acknowledged that there is a high 
structural similarity between lonafarnib and the impurities of concern. The specified minor differences 
do not indicate any major toxicological concern not already observed with lonafarnib itself. It is also 
acknowledged that the NOAEL used in the calculations is the highest tested dose in the 28-days repeat 
dose toxicity study. It is thus likely that the actual NOAEL is higher for all three impurities. 
The Applicant has provided a toxicological justification for the maximum levels of ethylbenzene in the 
quality section. The conservative approach to using the NOAEL from the studies in which ethylbenzene 
was inhaled is acknowledged. The selection of factors for the PDE calculation is also agreed. The actual 
calculation of the PDE was, however, not clear. The Applicant provided clarification of the calculated 
residual threshold and adjusted the threshold from 273 ppm to 373 ppm. The PDE of 3.725 mg/day 
and the following threshold of 373 ppm are acceptable.  
The Applicant has identified five genotoxic impurities. No data on the identification of the compounds 
as mutagenic was provided. A QSAR analysis was referred to, but the report could however not be 
located. The reports were submitted upon request. According to the dates, the reports were in fact not 
in place during the application. The conclusion is that the impurities were either positive or inclusive 
and therefore handled as potentially genotoxic remains. 
The Applicant was asked to justify the approach of a TTC value of 30 µg/day intake for >1 to 10 years 
according to the ICH M7, considering lonafarnib is for chronic life-long treatment. In the response, the 
Applicant has described actions to enable testing of the lower limits and also proposed a lowered limit 
to 14 ppm (from 20 ppm) of total genotoxic impurities. The Applicant also presented a plan to include 
a more sensitive approach and tighten the limits further in the future.  
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 48/140 
 
 
 
The 14 ppm limit and a maximum dose of 300 mg would allow 4.2 µg total daily intake of multiple 
impurities. This is below the ICH M7 level of 5 µg and thus acceptable. 
2.5.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The review of the non-clinical data available for lonafarnib indicates no major issues for concern. The 
application is acceptable from a non-clinical viewpoint. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant. 
The Applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The development programme 
Lonafarnib was previously developed for treatment in oncology. The lonafarnib oncology program was 
eventually terminated for reasons not related to safety.  
Lonafarnib as monotherapy or combination treatment has been studied in a few studies in 84 distinct 
patients; the primary endpoint in these studies was the change in the rate of weight gain compared to 
baseline (table 4). 
In order to evaluate the efficacy of lonafarnib monotherapy on the survival of patients with classic and 
non-classic HGPS, an observational cohort study survival analysis was conducted comparing all-cause 
mortality in patients treated with lonafarnib monotherapy with contemporaneous untreated patients 
from a large natural history cohort. The survival cohort study is considered the pivotal study.  
In addition, two single-arm, single-centre, open-label studies were submitted. Prolon1 was a Phase 2, 
open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study to evaluate the therapeutic effect of lonafarnib 
monotherapy in children (≥ 3 years of age) with HGPS or PL. The Triple Therapy study (Study 09-06-
0298) was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the prenylation 
inhibitors pravastatin and zoledronic acid in combination with lonafarnib for children (≥ 1 year of age) 
with HGPS or PL. The triple therapy patient cohort (Group 1) was treated with lonafarnib, pravastatin, 
and zoledronic acid. Patients previously on lonafarnib monotherapy could roll over to this study; an 
additional 23 treatment naïve patients were added to group 1. Based on results from the 40 to 52-
month visit, no additional benefit to triple-drug therapy was observed compared to lonafarnib 
monotherapy. As a result, treatment with pravastatin and zoledronic acid was discontinued, and 
patients were permitted to enter a lonafarnib monotherapy extension. Within study 09-06-0298 the 
Lonafarnib monotherapy treatment was expanded to include treatment-naïve patients (Prolon2 or 
Group 2).  
Prolon1 and Prolon2 are considered supportive studies as the data from these studies pertains to the 
proposed posology and indication.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Lonafarnib is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that is developed for the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford 
Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and progeroid laminopathies (PL). For patients with HGPS and PL, the 
recommended starting dose is 115 mg/m2 twice daily. This dose is administered in the morning and 
the evening during meals. After 4 months of treatment, the dose should be increased to 150 mg/m2 
twice daily, with a maximum dose of 150 mg per administration.  
The clinical pharmacology of lonafarnib was assessed in healthy volunteers, patients with advanced 
cancer and patients with HGPS and PL. Clinical studies were performed to investigate the absorption, 
metabolism and elimination of lonafarnib and the effect of food, the effect of opening the capsule, the 
effect of intrinsic factors (age, sex, renal and hepatic impairment), and several drug-drug interactions 
(DDI). In addition, in vitro studies were performed investigating the permeability, plasma protein 
binding, metabolism, transport and potentially clinically relevant DDIs. The studies in patients with 
advanced cancer could not be assessed and only provided as supportive, since it was unclear if the 
analytical methods used were sufficiently validated.

Physical-chemical properties 
Lonafarnib has one chiral centre and is administered as R-lonafarnib. No in vivo conversion to 
S-lonafarnib is expected to occur. Lonafarnib is considered a high permeable but low solubility 
substance. The fraction absorbed in vivo has not been determined. 
Analytical methods 
Several bioanalytical methods have been used throughout the clinical development programme of 
lonafarnib to determine lonafarnib concentrations in plasma. These bioanalytical methods have 
individually been sufficiently validated. However, the bioanalytical methods used in studies EIG-LNF-
015, EIG-LNF-017 and ProLon1 have not been cross-validated. The population pharmacokinetic model, 
however, estimated the residual error of the individual studies to be in the same order of magnitude. 
Therefore, no clinically relevant differences are to be expected due to the use of different analytical 
methods.  
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Data was used from patients included in the ProLon1, and healthy volunteers included in EIG-LNF-015 
(Group 2) and EIG-LNF-017 (Group 1 and 2). No studies were included in which patients received 
lonafarnib boosted with ritonavir. A non-linear mixed effect model was developed using NONMEM 7.4 
(ADVAN2 and TRANS2). First-order conditional estimation with interaction was used to obtain model 
parameters. The final model was a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order 
elimination, weight allometrically scaled with estimated exponents, sex as a covariate on CL and 
formulation as a covariate on bioavailability. The stochastic component of the model was best 
described with inter-individual variability on CL, V, KA and F1 and a proportional residual error model.  
The predictive performance of the model was considered to be quite poor due to bias in the prediction-
corrected visual predictive checks (Figure 4) and high estimate for the proportional error model 
(estimate = 0.43, which corresponds to a CV of approximately 70%). Therefore, the model cannot be

used for simulations but will provide some guidance in the estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters 
of patients included in the ProLon 1 trial.  
Figure 4. prediction-corrected visual predictive check 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetic profile of lonafarnib alone was characterised in 3 single-dose studies in healthy 
volunteers (lonafarnib dose of 50 to 104 mg) and in 2 multiple-dose studies in healthy volunteers 
(lonafarnib dose of 100 mg twice daily). A typical pharmacokinetic profile is displayed in Figure 5. 
However, the PK in the multiple-dose studies was not assessed after the first dose. Furthermore, no 
pharmacokinetic parameters were determined following the maximal clinical dose of 150 mg and 175 
mg after a single or twice daily repeated the dose in healthy volunteers.

Figure 5. Mean Lonafarnib Concentration vs. Time (Study EIG-LNF-017, group 1) after 75 mg 
BID 
Following a single dose of 100 mg lonafarnib (P00042), the Cmax was 323 ng/mL (CV=55%), and the 
AUC0-t was 2077 ng × h/mL (CV=61%). Maximal peak concentrations were observed 2 to 5 hours 
post-dose. Following repeated oral dosing with 100 mg twice daily (EIG-LNF-015 and EIG-LNF-017), 
the Cmax was 834 to 964 ng/mL (CV=32%), and the AUC0-τ was 6200 to 6940 ng × h/mL (CV=36-
37%). 
No absolute oral bioavailability studies have been conducted with lonafarnib. The oral bioavailability of 
lonafarnib appears to be relatively low as, in the mass-balance study P00260, systemic exposure of 
lonafarnib was only 50% of the exposure in plasma drug-derived radioactivity. Based on the high 
permeability characteristics of lonafarnib in humans, the absorption is most likely high, but lonafarnib 
is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (substrate of CYP3A4) and potentially efflux into the 
intestine following absorption (substrate of P-glycoprotein). 
It is recommended to administer lonafarnib with food in the HGPS and PL patient population, resulting 
in improved tolerability in patients with advanced tumours. Following a high-fat/high-caloric meal, the 
Cmax decreased by 55% and AUC by approximately 26% relative to the fasted state. Variability in these 
parameters decreased following a high-fat/high-caloric meal after multiple-dose administration. 
Following a low fat/low caloric meal, the Cmax decreased by 25% and AUC by approximately 22%. The 
tmax was delayed by 1 to 2 hours and between-patient variability in tmax increased following a 
high-fat/high-caloric or low fat/low caloric meal compared to fasted conditions. This is to be expected 
as gastric emptying under fed conditions is subject to variability between patients. 
The applicant submitted a relative bioequivalence study (EIG-LNF-019) in which 75 mg lonafarnib 
(suspended in orange juice) and 75 mg lonafarnib (suspended in apple sauce) were compared with 75 
mg lonafarnib administered as intact capsules. Administration of lonafarnib suspension in orange juice 
and as an intact capsule resulted in a similar concentration versus time profile. In contrast, 
administration of lonafarnib mixed with applesauce resulted in a higher peak exposure when compared 
to the intact lonafarnib capsule (1.16[1.00 to 1.35] for Cmax and 1.15 [0.98 to 1.41] for AUC0-t). The 
tmax was observed earlier for both lonafarnib in suspension with orange juice and lonafarnib mixed with 
applesauce. From a conservative perspective, the SmPC recommends to administer lonafarnib with 
orange juice instead of apple sauce only in patients that are unable to swallow the capsules. As dose

proportionality remains unclear, it is difficult to extrapolate the results obtained with the 75 mg dose to 
the 50 mg dose. It remains unclear whether the 50 mg formulation behaves similarly as the 75 mg 
formulation. The current advice relates to subjects that are unable to swallow; therefore the 50 mg 
could be considered more relevant for this population as these are most likely younger paediatric 
patients on a lower dose. At the higher dose (where more saturation in the pharmacokinetics can be 
expected), the influence of orange juice could be underestimated. However, as the impact of orange 
juice on the PK was rather mild, and the 50 mg and 75 mg are expected to be still in the relatively 
dose-proportional range, the clinical impact of a different exposure will probably be limited.  
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of lonafarnib is high (>99%). The blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.99, indicating 
no accumulation of lonafarnib in red blood cells. 
Lonafarnib appears to be highly distributed into tissue following a single 100 mg oral dose with an 
apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) values ranging from 221 L to 279 L. However, most likely, the 
Vd/F is high due to extensive first-pass metabolism (low oral bioavailability). 
Metabolism 
Lonafarnib is extensively metabolised in vitro in human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes with 
the most common metabolic pathways including oxidation, dehydrogenation and combinations of these 
two processes, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. 
The metabolism profile of lonafarnib was investigated in plasma, urine and faeces. In plasma, 
lonafarnib was ~50% of the radioactivity, metabolites HM17 (oxidation; 15.1%) and active metabolite 
HM21 (dehydrogenation; 13.9%) were the major metabolites observed.  
However, the plasma metabolite profile of lonafarnib was investigated using pooled samples from 6 
subjects at time points 1, 4 and 8 hours. The lonafarnib tmax occurs around 4 h, and its elimination 
half-life is also 4 hours. Therefore, the identification of metabolites following a single dose at 1 to 8 
hours may not be representative of the lonafarnib metabolite profile in humans. Additionally, lonafarnib 
is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and also a time-dependent CYP3A inducer and thus influences 
its own metabolism. Therefore, metabolite profile following a single dose may not be representative of 
that following multiple dosing.   
There is a concern for potential late formation of metabolites as only 60% radioactivity was recovered 
in the mass balance study after 10 days, while elimination half-life of lonafarnib is approximately 4h, 
but also because signs of accumulation can be observed in non-clinical studies in monkey (i.e. 
presence of radioactivity after 28 days of study in lymph nodes, brown fat and eye and also presence 
of radioactivity in liver and intestine, the latter two presumably due to their involvement in metabolism 
and excretion of the remaining parent/metabolites). Also, absolute bioavailability is unknown. At this 
stage, the accumulation of a metabolite of lonafarnib or the parent lonafarnib cannot be excluded, 
besides the fact that HM21 is not the cause of this potential accumulation. Therefore, the full plasma 
metabolite profile of lonafarnib should be investigated. This can either be done by characterising the 
metabolite profile in healthy volunteers at steady state over a time frame of at least 0 to 12 hours, and 
preferably also after 2 weeks of wash-out (to indicate the metabolites with a long elimination half-life 
or slow release from tissues), or conduct a new, appropriately designed, mass balance study where 
recovery exceeds at least 90% of the administered dose and 80% of the radioactivity is identified as 
recommended by the Guideline on the investigation of drug-drug interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 
1 Corr. 2**). This new mass balance study will be submitted as a post-authorisation measure. 
The Applicant characterised the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite HM21 after multiple dosages 
of lonafarnib in studies EIG-LNF-015 and EIG-LNF-017. The results demonstrated that HM21 is mainly 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 61/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
formed by CYP3A4. The ratio between parent/metabolite is approximately 8-17% for HM21. The half-
life of HM21 is approximately 7 to 12 hours. Therefore, these results did not exclude concerns around 
the metabolite profile of lonafarnib, but the contribution of HM21 to the overall effectivity is low.  
In faeces (major elimination route), metabolite HM3 (double oxidation), HM4 (triple oxidation and 
dehydrogenation), HM11 (opening up of the piperidine ring with the addition of a molecule of water) 
and HM17 (oxidation) were present for >5% of the radioactivity, with HM3 around 10%. The absolute 
oral bioavailability of lonafarnib and the site of first-pass metabolism (intestine or liver) is unknown. 
Therefore, it is unknown if part of the observed metabolites in faeces have been absorbed, formed and 
eliminated or are formed directly in the intestine (wall and intestinal flora) without absorption. 
Information on the metabolite profile at a steady state may help to understand the observed difference 
in metabolite profile between plasma and faeces. 
Transporters 
Based on the in vitro data, lonafarnib is most likely a substrate of P-glycoprotein and not a substrate of 
BCRP, OCT1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 
Excretion 
The major elimination route is via faeces. Non-clinical data in rats indicate that absorbed radioactivity 
is mainly eliminated via bile. The human elimination half-life (t½) of lonafarnib is 3 to 4 h, and the 
apparent clearance (CL/F) is 50 L/h. 
Dose proportionality and Time dependency  
No information on the dose-proportionality in healthy subjects or the patient population was provided. 
Dose proportionality was assessed in paediatric patients with advanced cancer, which indicated that 
the pharmacokinetics of lonafarnib is most likely not dose-proportional (Figure 6). As indicated above, 
it is unclear whether the bioanalytical method was appropriately validated of the studies with paediatric 
patients with advanced cancer, and disease effects cannot be excluded; therefore, these results should 
be interpreted with caution.

Figure 6. Individual Cmax and AUC Values of lonafarnib following once-daily oral 
administration on Day 1 and once- or twice-daily oral administration on Day 15 to patients 
with advanced cancer. 
The Applicant estimates with the population pharmacokinetic model that the accumulation ratio of 
lonafarnib is 1.27 in healthy volunteers and HGPS and PL patients. However, based on studies 
conducted in patients with advanced CNS tumours without ritonavir, the accumulation ratio of 
lonafarnib was estimated to be 3– to 5-fold over the investigated dose range. The population 
pharmacokinetic model is expected to underestimate the accumulation of lonafarnib due to potentially 
unable to characterise 2-compartment behaviour and the fact that the auto-inhibition and other time-
dependencies were not included in the structural model. It remains unclear how the pharmacokinetics 
of patients with advanced CNS tumours can be extrapolated to either healthy volunteers or patients 
with HGPS and PL, but the accumulation ratio of 3- to 5-fold is considered more reliable than the 
estimates of the population pharmacokinetic model.    
Special populations 
Patient population 
The pharmacokinetics of lonafarnib in the patient population have been studied in the ProLon 1 study, 
in which pharmacokinetic samples were collected on at least one study visit. Samples were taken up to 
8 hours after dosing. For several subjects with a tmax value above 4 hours, the elimination rate 
constant, and thus the terminal half-life, could not be reliably estimated using non-compartmental 
analysis. The Applicant used the data as input for a population pharmacokinetic analysis. The PK 
appears similar in healthy volunteers and the patients population, but the predictive performance of 
the model is very poor. Therefore, there is some uncertainty about whether this is actually the case. 
Also, several time dependencies have been identified, and the population pharmacokinetic model does 
not account for these time dependencies, which could be different between healthy volunteers and 
patients due to factors such as concomitant medication. 
The Applicant derived estimates for AUC0-tau,ss and Cmax,ss for patients included in the ProLon 1 study 
using the population pharmacokinetic model. The intra- and intersubject variability of Cmax, ss are 
20.8% and 36.9%, respectively. The intra- and intersubject variability of AUC0-tau,ss are 21.1% and 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 63/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
50.8%, respectively. It should however be noted that these could be underestimated as most 
informative data came from healthy volunteers and the time-dependencies in the pharmacokinetics of 
lonafarnib were not included in the model.  
Genetic polymorphisms 
The effect of genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A4 (e.g. CYP3A4*22) and CYP3A5 (e.g. CYP3A5*1) on the 
PK of lonafarnib and HM21 have not been investigated. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and 3A5 
may lead to increased (e.g. CYP3A4*22) or decreased (or CYP3A5*1) exposure to lonafarnib which 
may affect the efficacy and safety. The Applicant argued that the chance of having a polymorphism in 
CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 in patients with PL or HGPS is low. However, the effect size of polymorphisms on 
CYP3A4 on the pharmacokinetics of lonafarnib is expected to be clinically relevant because an increase 
in plasma exposure to lonafarnib could be associated with an increased probability of developing 
adverse reactions (such as QTc prolongation). On the other hand, loss of efficacy can be expected with 
decreasing exposure. Precautionary measures for mild and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors have been 
proposed by the Applicant, and the effects of polymorphisms in CYP3A4 (e.g. CYP3A4*22) are 
expected to result in similar increases in lonafarnib exposures as mild and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
SmPC section 4.4 includes a warning regarding the fact that subjects with a known dysfunctional 
polymorphisms in CYP3A4 should consider a dose reduction and additionally QTc monitoring at the 
time of initiation of treatment.  
Renal impairment 
Urinary excretion of the parent compound lonafarnib and also metabolites was minimal in the mass-
balance study. No clinical studies were performed investigating the effect of impaired renal function on 
the PK of lonafarnib. However, no decreased renal function is expected in the patient population and 
therefore, no clinical studies are warranted investigating the effect of renal impairment on the PK of 
lonafarnib. 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinical studies were conducted investigating the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of 
lonafarnib when administered as monotherapy. Considering the importance of hepatic clearance, an 
increase in exposure to lonafarnib is expected with a decrease in hepatic function. However, no 
decreased hepatic function is expected in the patient population and therefore, no clinical studies are 
warranted investigating the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of lonafarnib. 
Gender 
Based on study P02673, healthy female subjects appear to have a slightly higher Cmax (26%) and a 
higher AUC0-inf (44%) compared to healthy male subjects. It should be noted that these analyses were 
not corrected for body weight; therefore, the true effects of gender may be overestimated. In addition, 
no effect of gender on AUC0-t and Cmax were observed in post-hoc analyses of the ProLon1 trial. 
Race 
The effect of race on the PK of lonafarnib has not been evaluated. 
Age 
The influence of age of 3 to 18 years on the PK of lonafarnib was investigated using pharmacokinetic 
data obtained in the ProLon1 trial. From the correlation matrices, it appears that exposure increases 
with age. If patients are dosed from birth on, then the ontogeny of CYP3A4, 3A5 and 3A7 may affect 
the PK of lonafarnib in this sub-population. However, as treatment is recommended from the age of 12 
months, this is not expected to be an issue. 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 64/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly healthy subjects, aged >65 years, had a higher Cmax (27%) and a higher AUC0-inf (59%) (study 
P02673). It should be noted that these analyses were not corrected for body weight; therefore, the 
true effects of age may be overestimated. Furthermore, the age category elderly is not considered 
relevant for patients with HGPS and PL. 
Weight 
Body weight appears to affect the exposure to lonafarnib, with higher exposure at lower body weight. 
The current BSA-based posology should be able to maintain approximately equivalent exposure for 
every patient. 
Drug-drug interactions 
Lonafarnib as victim 
In vitro, lonafarnib is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and in some patients also via CYP3A5. The effect 
of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole; 200 mg once daily × 5 days) and strong CYP3A4 inducer 
(rifampin; 600 mg once daily × 7 days) on the PK of lonafarnib was investigated in clinical DDI studies. 
Strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 significantly affected the exposure (Cmax and AUC) to 
lonafarnib (Table 6).

No data is available for weak and moderate inhibitors or weak or moderate inducers.  
For strong CYP3A inhibitors, the Applicant argues, based on study P00393 with a strong inhibitor 
(ketoconazole) administered for 5 days, that the AUC of lonafarnib was increased by 270% and 425%. 
However, the time-dependent inhibition and induction potential of CYP3A by lonafarnib was not 
considered. Based on the interaction study with midazolam, lonafarnib can be considered a strong 
(irreversible) inhibitor of CYP3A4. Auto-inhibition of CYP3A4 might be the reason for the unexpected 3 
to 5-fold accumulation of lonafarnib at steady-state compared to single-dose exposures. Therefore, the 
effect of other CYP3A4 inhibitors on the exposure of lonafarnib is likely less pronounced after lonafarnib 
reaches a steady-state compared to the effects on a single dose (as was tested in the ketoconazole 
study).  
The Applicant has presented no data/discussion for moderate inhibitors. A drug-drug interaction study 
with a clinically relevant moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 at steady-state conditions of lonafarnib will be 
submitted as a post-authorisation measure. Until the study results are available, SmPC sections 4.4 
and 4.5 include a warning to avoid the use of moderate-inhibitors of CYP3A4, but if avoidance is not 
possible, it is recommended to reduce the dose of lonafarnib by 50% and to conduct QTc monitoring.  
No dose adjustments are considered necessary for weak inhibitors, but a 50% reduction (as advised 
for moderate inhibitors) and QTc monitoring should be recommended in case of toxicity. This was 
included in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
The results of study EIG-LNF-007 with the strong inducer rifampin, however, indicated that lonafarnib 
Cmax and AUC were decreased by 92% and 98%. Therefore, loss of efficacy can also be expected with 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022

moderate inducers and to a lesser extent with weak inducers, although the effect might be less 
relevant in clinical practice as lonafarnib is also a time-dependent inducer of CYP3A. A warning as 
currently implemented in the SmPC is considered sufficient in this regard. 
Lonafarnib may be a substrate of P-glycoprotein based on in vitro data. The effect of a strong 
P-glycoprotein inhibitor (not an inhibitor of CYP3A4) on the PK of lonafarnib was not investigated in 
vivo. A DDI study with lonafarnib and a P-gp inhibitor, which is not a CYP3A4 inhibitor, in healthy 
volunteers will be conducted as a post-authorisation measure. 
Lonafarnib as perpetrator 
Based on in vitro data, lonafarnib is a direct inhibitor of CYP3A4 at clinically relevant maximal intestinal 
and maximal systemic concentrations. In addition, lonafarnib is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 
at clinically relevant maximal intestinal and maximal systemic concentrations.  
The Applicant performed clinical DDI studies to investigate the effect of lonafarnib on the PK of other 
drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (loperamide and midazolam) and CYP2C19 (omeprazole) following 
repeated dosing of lonafarnib (Table 7). The clinical DDI studies using repeated dosing for 5 days will 
show the worst-case DDI due to direct and time-dependent inhibition. Therefore, based on clinical 
data, lonafarnib is a clinically relevant inhibitor of CYP3A4.

In vitro, lonafarnib is an inducer of PXR. The EC50 parameter was estimated to be 1.29 to 2.24 μM, 
indicating that lonafarnib could be a PXR inducer in vivo. The clinical implication of this finding can be 
evaluated using the clinical DDI study with midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate). The exposure of midazolam 
was increased 7-fold by lonafarnib, indicating that the net effect of lonafarnib is CYP3A4 inhibition 
(Table 7). However, other CYP enzymes, UGT and transporters could also be induced when PXR is 
induced. Interaction studies with omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) and fexofenadine (Pgp substrate) 
have been conducted (Table 7). Lonafarnib slightly increased the exposure of omeprazole, indicating 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 66/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that lonafarnib is unlikely to be an inducer of CYP2C19. Also, the interaction with fexofenafine did not 
indicate induction of Pgp by lonafarnib. In all these interaction studies, lonafarnib was administered for 
5 days, which is too short for a maximal induction effect; probably only half of the maximal induction 
effect is reached within this timeframe.  No DDI with an oral contraceptive has been conducted and it 
cannot be excluded that lonafarnib can induce UGTs and hence lower exposures of oral contraceptives 
that UGT mainly metabolizes cannot be excluded. Considering the young age of the target population, 
the absence of DDI with oral contraceptives cannot be accepted. A DDI study will be conducted as a 
post-authorisation measure and, until the results of this study are available, the absence of such study 
will be acknowledged in the SmPC section 4.5, and it is recommended to use a barrier method as a 
method of contraception.  
Based on in vitro data, lonafarnib is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OCT1, MATE1 and MATE2-K 
at clinically relevant maximal systemic concentrations. Furthermore, lonafarnib is an inhibitor of 
P-glycoprotein and BCRP at clinically relevant maximal intestinal concentrations. Lonafarnib may also 
be an inhibitor of OATP1B1 at relevant maximal portal concentrations and in some patients at relevant 
maximal systemic concentrations (e.g. highest Cmax observed in patients). The Applicant performed 
clinical DDI studies to investigate the effect of lonafarnib on the PK of other drugs that are substrates 
of P-glycoprotein (fexofenadine), BCRP (rosuvastatin) and OATP1B1 (pitavastatin) following repeated 
dosing of lonafarnib (Table 11). Based on clinical data, lonafarnib is not a clinically relevant inhibitor of 
P-glycoprotein, BCRP and OATP1B1. Currently, there is no clinically sensitive substrate for OCT1, and 
therefore, the observed in vitro DDI should be included in section 4.5 of the SmPC. The Applicant has 
also made clear that concomitant use of metformin (a clinically relevant substrate of MATE1 and MAT2-
K) in patients with HGPS and PL is very unlikely. No other clinically relevant substrates are at this 
moment available, but this might change in the future. Therefore, no in vivo DDI study is considered 
necessary. Based on in vitro data, the potential interaction for a clinically relevant interaction with 
MATE1 and MAT2-K is mentioned in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
The applicant evaluated the interaction potential of the active metabolite HM21. HM21 is considered an 
in vitro reversible inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
The influence of HM21 on transporters was not investigated. This interaction profile is highly similar to 
lonafarnib, and as HM21 is only present in plasma as 8 to 17% of the parent, the potential for clinically 
relevant interactions other than charactered for lonafarnib is considered to be low. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
In normal cells, the precursor of lamin A, prelamin A, undergoes post-translational farnesylation of its 
C-terminal CaaX motif by farnesyltransferase. This modification localizes the prelamin A to the nuclear 
membrane, where zinc metalloproteinase ZPMSTE24 cleaves off 15 amino acids at the C terminus 
(including the new farnesyl group), leaving mature lamin A that is then incorporated into the nuclear 
lamina to act as a scaffold for the cell nucleus. 
In HGPS, mutation of the gene encoding lamin A, LMNA, results in mutant prelamin A that cannot be 
processed by ZMPSTE24, resulting in the production of mutated lamin A that retains its farnesyl lipid 
anchor. This leads to the accumulation of a dominant negative farnesylated abnormal lamin A protein 
(progerin) at the nuclear membrane, significantly altering nuclear architecture and function, causing 
cellular damage via structural instability and functional abnormalities that lead to disease. Progerin can 
affect critical cellular processes, including gene transcription, DNA replication, and cell division. The 
most common genetic mutation of the LMNA gene found in HGPS is a de novo silent C to T 
substitution, typically in exon 11. PLs are caused by mutations in LMNA or mutations in proteins 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 67/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
affecting the post-translational pathway of LMNA, including ZMPSTE24, and can progress to clinical 
features that overlap with HGPS.  
Primary Pharmacology 
Lonafarnib selectively inhibits human farnesyl protein transferase (IC50=1.9 nM). Initially, no 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers were validated, and survival was considered the pharmacodynamic 
endpoint. During the procedure the Applicant submitted new data pertaining to the analyses of 
progerin levels in HGPS patients included in Prolon1 and prolon2 (see below). In the majority of HGPS 
patients, the cause of death is due to cardiovascular problems, e.g. arteriosclerosis. Notably, in the 
efficacy analyses, weight gain was chosen as the primary outcome and survival is not listed among 
secondary outcomes. In addition, cardiovascular endpoints were studied in the clinical studies. Refer to 
the data on clinical efficacy for details. 
Secondary Pharmacology 
The effect of lonafarnib in human cardiac repolarization has been investigated in EIG-LNF-010. The 
study was a double-blind, placebo- and moxifloxacin controlled, multiple-dose, parallel-group study 
with a nested crossover design for the moxifloxacin/placebo comparison, conducted in healthy 
volunteers.  
The study demonstrates that the combination of lonafarnib and ritonavir does not prolong the Qtc 
interval in healthy volunteers at therapeutic doses. The effect of lonafarnib cannot be isolated from this 
study. However, it is unlikely that lonafarnib alone causes Qtc-prolongation >5 ms in therapeutic 
doses.  
Figure 7: Relationship between plasma-concentration and effect. 
The Applicant has not provided an overall dose justification. No dose-escalation studies have been 
conducted in the target population, and no exposure-response analysis has been provided. 
The starting dose of 115 mg/m2 BID was the MTD in a population of paediatric oncology patients and 
applying this dose as starting dose in the HGPS, and PL population seems reasonable. Plasma 
concentration of lonafarnib appeared to decline with prolonged exposure which probably explains that 
the lonafarnib dose was increased to 150 mg/m2 BID after 4 months in the study 07-01-007. However, 
it is not clear why 4 months was chosen as a cut-off for the dose-escalation.  
Even though the 115 mg/m2 -150 mg/m2 BID dosing regimen was tolerable in the HGPS and PL 
population and efficient in terms of weight gain, it is not known whether a lower dose of lonafarnib 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 68/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
could be efficient. Additionally, the BID regimen is not adequately accounted for a T½ of about 4 
hours, which could cause quite low lonafarnib Cthrough levels in a BID dosing regimen. Unfortunately, 
no data on Cthrough-levels or AUC to ensure efficacy in the HGPS, and PL population has been 
provided.  
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of lonafarnib have been investigated in healthy volunteers and patients with HGPS 
and  PL.  Several  remaining  DDI  concerns  have  been  resolved  with  the  implementation  of  appropriate 
warnings in the SmPC and corresponding DDI studies will be undertaken as post-authorisation measures. 
Based on the non-clinical data provided (see non-clinical section above), the pharmacological proof of 
concept can be considered demonstrated regarding the fact that lonafarnib inhibits farnesylation. This 
non-clinical observation can be translated to human in vivo pharmacology as under lonafarnib, the 
percentage of abnormal nuclei (or misshaped nuclei) in human cellular material is reduced in a dose-
dependent matter.  
There is no direct relation to the improvement of abnormal nuclei and pharmacodynamic/clinical 
endpoints such as survival or cardiovascular parameters (e.g. PWV, SBP, carotid echo density). It can 
be concluded that lonafarnib indeed reduces the production of progerin in cells. This adds further to the 
proof of concept and strongly suggests that lonafarnib blocks progerin production, which might have an 
impact on at least some cardiovascular parameters and potentially also on other clinical endpoints. 
From the non-clinical data, it can be learned that indeed in progeria mouse models under lonafarnib 
like molecules, cardiovascular issues are reduced, and progerin accumulation is reduced in these 
mouse models.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Limited PK data has been provided for lonafarnib as monotherapy. The predictive performance of the 
population pharmacokinetic model is considered poor. Therefore, the model cannot be used for 
simulations. However, for this indication, this issue is no longer pursued. There are some concerns 
regarding the metabolite profile and clinical DDIs. The Applicant will conduct a new mass balance study 
to elucidate the metabolite profile as a post-authorisation measure. Further, a study will be conducted 
as a post-authorisation measure to investigate the effect of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor on the PK of 
lonafarnib. Furthermore, a DDI study with P-glycoprotein inhibitor and a DDI study with oral 
contraceptives will be undertaken as post-authorisation measures.  
Under lonafarnib, the percentage of abnormal nuclei in human cellular material (e.g. fibroblasts) is 
reduced in a dose-dependent matter. Although it is considered demonstrated that under continued 
lonafarnib treatment, progerin levels decrease in HGPS patients, there is no direct link to clinically 
relevant endpoints (such as PWV, SBP and carotid echo density). Given the disease pathophysiology, 
there is a theoretically accepted and plausible mechanism in which progerin reduction acts on the 
vascular tissues inducing apoptosis and consequently inflammation and atherosclerosis. Refer to the 
clinical efficacy section for further details. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Table 8 displays the studies that were conducted with lonafarnib in the intended patient population. Note 
that for the proposed indication, the studies pertaining to lonafarnib monotherapy are considered most 
important, e.g. study 07-01-0007 (Prolon1) and Prolon2 as part of the triple therapy study 09-06-0298. 
Assessment report

Data  on  patients  treated  with  triple  therapy  is  considered  supportive  information.  The  pivotal  clinical 
study  submitted  by  the  applicant  is  the  Cohort  Survival  Study.  Prolon1  and  Prolon2  are  considered 
supportive.  
2.6.5.1.  Main study(ies) 
Main study 
An observational cohort survival study: results from a pooled analysis of lonafarnib treatment 
in patients with Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome 
General Design and Participants  
This was a cohort study comparing all-cause mortality in lonafarnib monotherapy treated HGPS 
patients with untreated HGPS patients.  
All patients (treated and untreated patients) and their associated data were identified using the 
Progeria Research Foundation International Registry 
(http://www.progeriaresearch.org/patient_registry.html), published scientific and news articles, and 
publicly available databases (Figure 3). Of 258 total patients in the complete natural history cohort, 
211 were identified from the Progeria Research Foundation International Registry, and 47 patients’ 
study inclusion information was derived purely from scientific publications. Minimum inclusion criteria 
were HGPS phenotype confirmed by clinical experts and information on living age or age of death. 
Additional data collected included sex, country of origin, cause of death, and genotype, when available.  
The treated cohorts included patients from two single-arm, single-centre lonafarnib monotherapy 
trials, ProLon1 (N=27) and lonafarnib monotherapy extension study (the designated ProLon2 
population; N=35).  
The treated patients received oral lonafarnib (150 mg/m2) twice daily in Prolon1 and Prolon2. 
Untreated patients received no clinical trial medications but may have received medication for 
symptomatic treatment.  
Figure 3, Figure 15, Figure 16 and Figure 17 describe the selection process for the matched analyses 
pool, including reasons why these individuals did not participate in ProLon1 and ProLon2. It seems that 
patients were excluded from the Natural History Cohort due to poor health status/morbidities or 
incapable of visiting the clinic, precluding their participation and therefore introduces selection bias.  
The earliest patient observation for both the treated cohorts and the untreated contemporaneous 
controls used in the survival analyses was in 1991. 
Treated patients were matched with contemporaneous (birth date ≥1991) untreated patients by a 
random matching method using age, sex, and the continent of residency as propensity factors. Note 
that the patients included in the survival analysis were treated with lonafarnib in their respective 
studies, either Prolon1 or Prolon2. 
Methods 
The observational cohort survival study analysis was designed to evaluate all identified HGPS patients 
worldwide and compared all-cause mortality in lonafarnib monotherapy (e.g. Prolon1 and Prolon2) 
treated patients with HGPS with contemporaneous (birth date 
1991) untreated patients from a 
natural history cohort. Thus, the cohort survival study assembled a control group external to the 
≥
clinical trials.

Study Participants 
Inclusion criteria 
Natural History Cohort (NHC): 
For inclusion in the natural history cohort, patients must have been identified from the Progeria Research 
Foundation (PRF) International Progeria Registry, such that they had no prior exposure to lonafarnib. 
The PRF started the construction of the Natural History Cohort by harvesting data from (1) PRF’s internal 
patient database and (2) PRF’s International Registry. Sources used to identify children with HGPS for 
the database and registry included:  
• Case studies from W. Ted Brown, MD (Director; New York State Institute for Basic Research in 
Developmental Disabilities)  
•  The  Sunshine  Foundation,  which  formerly  sponsored  Progeria  reunions  annually  for  children 
with Progeria and maintained rosters and photos.  
• Web searches of news articles and publicly available databases (e.g., Legacy.com)  
• PubMed literature search for case report publications.  
• A physician, family member of someone with knowledge of a child (provided parental consent 
was obtained) that may have HGPS might inform a PRF staffer or Dr. Leslie Gordon of a possible 
case of HGPS.  
• Case studies from Dr. Leslie Gordon.  
The eligibility criteria below were used to determine patient eligibility for inclusion in the Natural History 
Cohort: 
• Clinical and/or genetic diagnosis of HGPS; 
• Available data on date of birth and date of death; 
• OR, if one of the above was missing: 
• Age of death; 
• OR, known vital status on January 1, 2018. 
Treated population: 
For inclusion in the treated population, patients must have been enrolled in ProLon1 (Study 07-01-0007) 
or Monotherapy Group 2 (ProLon2 Study 09-06-0298). Both studies are described under the paragraph 
of supportive studies. 
Exclusion criteria 
Patients with non–progerin-producing laminopathies were excluded from the analyses. 
Treatments 
Patients  in  the  Natural  History  Cohort  (NHC)  did  not  receive  active  treatment  but  may  have  received 
other medications to treat their symptoms.  
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022

Patients in the active treatment group received treatment lonafarnib monotherapy in study Prolon1 and 
Prolon2. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
• 
To  evaluate  the  association  of  lonafarnib  monotherapy  using  the  protein  farnesyltransferase 
inhibitor lonafarnib with prolonging survival time in patients with HGPS in a combined analysis 
of the ProLon1 and ProLon2 study populations. 
Secondary Objectives 
• To evaluate the association of monotherapy using the protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor lonafarnib 
with the reduction of incidence of all-cause mortality in a combined analysis of the ProLon1 and ProLon2 
study populations; and 
• To evaluate the association of monotherapy using the protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor lonafarnib 
on the incidence rate of all-cause mortality adjusted for patient-observation time in a combined analysis 
of the ProLon1 and ProLon2 study populations. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Principal Efficacy Variable(s) 
The principal efficacy variable of this analysis was time to eligible all-cause mortality (death) before June 
1, 2019. 
Key Secondary Efficacy Variable(s) 
The key secondary variables were: 
• the incidence rate of eligible all-cause mortality before the cut-off date of June 1, 2019; 
• the incidence rate of eligible all-cause mortality before the cut-off date of June 1, 2019, adjusted 
for patient-time.  
Randomisation, blinding (masking) and Matching 
Both Prolon1 and Prolon2 studies were single-arm, and therefore randomisation and blinding were not 
applicable. 
HGPS patients from the pooled Prolon1 and Prolon2 study were randomly matched with patients from 
the NHC based on age, sex and continent.  
Primary Matching Method (random untreated):  
Unpaired treated patients were sorted by descending age at treatment initiation. For the first treated 
patient in this sorted list, all unpaired untreated patients of the same sex and from the same continent 
of residency who were alive at the age when the treated patient began lonafarnib were identified. From 
this group of untreated patients, one was randomly selected and used as the matched untreated 
patient in the analysis for this treated patient; this untreated patient was no longer available for 
matching with any remaining treated patient. Follow-up for both patients in the matched pair began at 
the age of treatment initiation for the treated patient in the matched pair. 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 72/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Several other matching strategies were performed which resembles the primary matching method and 
all based on all untreated candidates sorted by their last known age in descending order, namely Fixed 
50th Percentile, Fixed 75th Percentile, Fixed 100th Percentile, Random within Upper 50th Percentile of 
Untreated, and Least Favourable Match, which attempted to capture the patients with the best 
longevity among the untreated group. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
ProLon1 and ProLon2 Intention-to-Treat (ITT1_2) Analysis Population: 
All patients treated with lonafarnib from ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined were included in the ITT1_2 
analysis population. In addition, the 173 untreated patients in the Brown University & Progeria 
Research Foundation HGPS natural history pool were also included in the ITT1_2 analysis population. 
The ITT1_2 analysis population will be used for sensitivity analyses on ProLon1 and ProLon2 patients 
combined.  
ProLon1 and ProLon2 Contemporaneous Intention-to-Treat (CITT1_2) Analysis Population: 
All patients treated with lonafarnib from ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined were included in the CITT1_2 
analysis population. From the 173 untreated patients in the Brown University & Progeria Research 
Foundation HGPS natural history pool, a total of 81 contemporaneous patients (born in or after 1991) 
who had not been included in a treatment trial were used as the CITT1_2 analysis population. The 
CITT1_2 analysis population was used for key analyses on ProLon1 and ProLon2 patients combined. 
For the primary efficacy analysis, the CITT1_2 analysis population was used. The analysis based on the 
ITT1_2 population will be considered as a sensitivity analysis. 
Eligible All-Cause Mortality is a subset of all deaths: 
For both ProLon1 and ProLon2 patients, deaths that occurred before entering either the triple therapy 
or initiation of everolimus therapy (study 0000170505), including ones that had occurred after the last 
date of monotherapy treatment, were considered eligible. 
Definition of Maximum Follow-Up Time 
• 
For a ProLon1 and Prolon2 patient, the maximum follow-up time is defined as either the 
age/date at the initiation of triple therapy or everolimus treatment, the age/date of lost 
to follow-up, or the age/date of death, or June 1, 2019, whichever is earlier. 
• 
For the untreated patients, the maximum follow-up time is either the last age/date of lost to 
follow-up, age/date of death, or June 1, 2019, whichever is earlier. 
Censoring for Matched Data in key analyses: 
For the key analysis, treated and matched untreated patients were censored at 3 years post age of 
treatment start.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves, where survival is defined as not experiencing eligible all-cause mortality, 
for the treated and untreated matched groups through the maximum follow-up time up to 3 years post 
age of treatment start are presented. The 95% confidence intervals at each event time are presented. 
Assessment report

Page 73/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The comparison between the treated and matched untreated group was carried out using a log-rank 
test stratified on sex and continent.  
In addition, an unconditioned Cox proportional hazards model stratified on sex and continent was used 
to compare the treated and matched untreated groups.  
Sensitivity Analyses 
The most important sensitivity analyses are: 
-  The primary survival analysis performed for the ITT1_2 population. This population also 
includes the untreated NHC patients born before 1991. 
-  Primary survival analyses were performed for each individual study and for the belonging ITT 
and CITT populations. 
Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
- 
Incidence of Eligible Deaths 
A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was performed to compare the treated patients with the 
matched untreated patients with respect to the proportion of patients with eligible death during 
the follow-up period up to 3 years post age of treatment start, adjusted for sex and continent 
(if matching by continent was feasible). 
Results 
Participant flow 
For the participants flow refer to Figure 3. 
To compare mortality rates among treated versus untreated patients, matching was performed 
whereby 62 patients from ProLon1 (n=27) plus ProLon2 (n=35) combined were randomly matched to 
the individuals from the pool of 81 untreated patients described above. Due to the limited number of 
contemporaneous patients available, the characteristics used as matching criteria were prioritized, and 
the most important factors in determining similarity among patients were chosen: age, sex, and the 
continent of residency. Matching was contemporaneous to ensure that similar medical care was 
available to both groups.

When censored at the start of another treatment or at 3 years, five of 62 patients died in the treated 
group, whereas 21 of 81 patients died in the untreated group. 
The  Kaplan-Meier  curves  showed  clear  and  early  separation  (Figure 10).  A  statistically  significant 
improvement in survival time (censored at 3 years) was associated with lonafarnib treatment compared 
to untreated controls (mean 2.83 vs 2.34 years; p=0.0002, stratified log-rank test) and based on the 
CITT1_2 population.  
Analysis of the survival data using the Cox proportional hazards model based on the CITT1_2 population 
shows an estimated HR of 0.17 (95% CI of 0.06 to 0.48). All matching methods as presented in Figure 11 
showed the results for the estimated Hazard ratios (HRs).

CI  =  confidence  interval;  FDA  =  Food  and  Drug  Administration;  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product[1]  Treated  patients  sorted  by 
descending age at treatment initiation were matched to untreated patients by sex and continent. This is the primary match method.[2] 
Treated patients sorted by descending age at treatment initiation were matched to untreated patients by sex and continent at the 
defined percentile of age (if two then the oldest is selected). Untreated patients are not assigned randomly for this match method.[3] 
Treated patients sorted by descending age at treatment initiation were matched to untreated patients in the upper 50th percentile of 
age by sex and continent.[4] Treated patients sorted by descending age at treatment initiation were first matched to untreated patients 
who were alive or censored and then to the untreated patients with the largest age at death.[5] Three additional independent matches 
were created for sensitivity analysis using the primary match method.[6] Six of the 81 untreated patients were excluded from the 
population prior to using the primary match method. The data for these patients is unavailable to be inspected by the FDA due to 
consent issues.[7] Treated patients sorted by descending age at treatment initiation were matched to untreated patients by sex and 
proxy for continent.*This Cox proportional hazards model was stratified on sex and continent/proxy; it includes treatment group as a 
factor, age at treatment start as a covariate, and the interaction between treatment group and age at treatment start. The hazard 
ratio at the average age of treatment start was summarized.

Analysis. Population (N=143). 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity Analyses 
The survival results of the sensitivity analyses show considerable variability between and within (ITT and 
CITT, respectively) the two individual studies (Prolon1 and Prolon2), and treatment effect estimates are 
typically smaller and mostly not significant, and thus not consistent with the survival results of the pooled 
survival analysis based on the CITT1_2 population. The survival results for the pooled studies based on 
the ITT1_2 population (CITT1_2 plus untreated patients born before 1991) is also inconsistent with the 
survival  results  based  on  the  CITT1_2  population.  Because  the  sensitivity  analyses  do  not  show 
consistent results, the treatment effect of the pooled primary survival analysis is uncertain. Indicating 
that the treatment-related survival benefit of lonafarnib monotherapy in patients with HGPS is unclear. 
With  this  censoring  method  (censored  as  start  new  therapy  or  3  years)  and  this  matching  method 
(random selection of one match), the results from Prolon1 and Prolon2 are numerically comparable or 
better for lonafarnib at 1 and 2 years. However, censoring at adapted last-follow-up and the ‘repeated 
random matching with replacement' is considered to mitigate possible biases due to differences in follow-
up and the number of available candidates for matching. 
When these analyses are performed, survival curves seem to favour the NHC patients in Prolon2 (e.g., 
median 7.2 in NHC vs 4.3 for lonafarnib), at least for the longer-term follow-up.

The Cox proportional hazard model (Table 17) shows that age of treatment start is likely to be an 
independent factor in predicting the timing of patient mortality. After adjusting for this independent 
factor, treatment with lonafarnib was found to significantly prolong survival compared with those that 
were untreated.

Addition of 18 treatment naïve patients to Prolon 2 
The Study 09-06-0298 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) concluded that adding pravastatin and 
zoledronate to lonafarnib did not impart additional efficacy over lonafarnib alone. 
To assess survival, these groups can be treated as if they were receiving lonafarnib monotherapy 
throughout their entire treatment.  
Adding the 18 HGPS drug-naïve patients that started in the triple therapy portion of Study 09-06-0298 
(Group 1) to the ProLon2 (Group 2) population eliminates the large difference in follow-up time between 
the two study populations and increases the ProLon2 sample size. 
Figure 10 shows that ProLon2, when included in the drug-naïve triple therapy HGPS patients, provides 
the same survival benefit as ProLon1. This is especially true when early deaths are considered in 
ProLon2 are primarily a function of the inclusion of older patients. As previously mentioned, there were 
a disproportionate number of older patients in ProLon2 versus ProLon1. These patients all resided on 
the steeply sloped portion of the natural history KM survival curve (≥ 11 years of age), and two 
patients only received a few months of therapy before dying (patients 5673 and 6689).

Key secondary Analysis 
Incidence of Eligible Deaths 
The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test was performed based on the CITT1_2 population to compare 
the treated and untreated groups with respect to the incidence of mortality during the follow-up period 
up to 3 years post age of treatment start. The estimated incidence is 8% for the treated group and 
34% for the untreated group. The RR is 0.21, with a 95% CI 0.08 – 0.54 (Table 14).

1)  Although the title of the study is “An Observational Cohort Survival Study”, in fact it 
should be considered a cohort survival analysis as patients selected from Prolon1 
and Prolon2 received lonafarnib treatment either in Prolo1, Prolon2, or other 
studies. 
In the NHC patients could have been treated with other medication for 
symptomatic treatment.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Comparison between survivors and non-survivors while on lonafarnib treatment 
A comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the cardiovascular parameters and mortality for 
the ProLon1 and ProLon2 patients (i.e., the same population used for the survival analysis) was 
conducted. The mortality status of the patients in the analyses was determined as of June 1, 2019. 
These analyses were done for ProLon1 and ProLon2 separately and combined. There were 41 survivors 
and 21 non-survivors (Table 16).

Age at start of treatment 
Patients who survived under continued lonafarnib treatment median age was 5.6 versus 9.0 in the 
non-survivor group. 
Cardiovascular parameters 
Pulse wave velocity 
Median baseline PWV was not significantly different at 8.70 m/Sec and 9.20 m/Sec amongst survivors 
and non-survivors, respectively. In general, both populations of patients had statistically significant 
reductions from baseline to EOT. However, median EOT PWV was significantly higher at 10.30 m/Sec in 
the patients who died compared to 8.00 m/Sec amongst survivors (p=0.008).

Carotid Echodensity 
The carotid artery echodensity at all sites except intima-media for both survivors and those who died 
was elevated at baseline compared to age- and gender-matched controls but not meaningfully different 
between the two groups of patients at all sites of measurement. A responder analysis for change in 
carotid echodensity was carried out per the protocol definition: EOT value no greater than 90% of the 
baseline value. There was no meaningful difference between the number or proportion of responders in 
each patient group (e.g. survivors vs non-survivors). 
Median carotid IMT was greater at baseline amongst the patients who died 0.44 mm versus 0.41 mm 
(p=0.012) and above the limit of normal for children less than 10 years of age: CIMT is constant 
(0.42±0.05 mm) in healthy children younger than 10 years, regardless of sex or BMI. CIMT increases 
after the age of 10 years (Baroncini et al., 2016). At the EOT, carotid IMT was not different between 
the two groups of patients (median 0.41 mm, p=0.99). 
It was demonstrated that baseline PWV was correlated to baseline carotid echodensity.

Clinical data in PL patients 
Of the 95 patients enrolled in all clinical studies of lonafarnib for HGPS or PL, 4 patients had PL; only 
one was included in Prolon1. Three of 4 patients had a processing deficient mutation that would be 
expected to benefit from treatment with lonafarnib. Patients 4371 (cell line 318) and 4729 (cell line 
317), both have in vitro cell line and clinical data available for assessment. In summary, the in vitro 
cell line data support the clinical benefits experienced by both patients. As of September 2020, three of 
4 PL patients enrolled in a BCH progeria study remain on lonafarnib monotherapy. All three have been 
taking lonafarnib alone or in combination with other study medications for at least 10 years. Limited 
data on the changes from baseline in PWV are available, but the data indicates an improvement in 
PWV under lonafarnib treatment. 
For two PL patients, the effects of lonafarnib on bone structure using pQCT were available. Both 
patients showed improvements in measures of loadbearing capacity and bone bending strength. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Not applicable. Classic Progeria is mainly a paediatric disease. Most patients will not survive beyond 
the second decade of life.  
2.6.5.2.  Supportive study(ies) 
Supportive studies 
Two supportive studies were performed that are considered important to the claimed indication; study 
ProLon1 (or 07-01-0007) and study Prolon2 as part of the triple therapy study 09-06-0298. In these 
two studies, patients received lonafarnib monotherapy.  
Study 09-06-0298 was originally designed to investigate the efficacy of triple therapy (Pravastatin + 
Zoledronic acid + lonafarnib), however, after an interim analysis the results were not as expected, and 
it was decided to switch the patients to lonafarnib monotherapy. In addition, to this group, a new 
treatment naïve group of HGPS patients was enrolled (Group2 or Prolon2).  
As for the benefit/risk discussion the cardiovascular endpoints, especially PWV, SBP and echodensity 
are considered potentially supportive to survival these will be described.

Methods 
Study Participants 
Study 07-01-0007, ProLon1:  
Study 07-01-0007 was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study to evaluate the 
therapeutic effect of lonafarnib monotherapy in children with HGPS or PL (n=29).  
All patients initiated treatment with 115 mg/m2 lonafarnib. In the absence of significant toxicity related 
to drug treatment, patients continued therapy for 24 to 30 months. At the end of their 2-year 
assessment (which could occur from 24 to 30 months), patients were to be removed from therapy. 
For inclusion into the trial, patients were required to fulfil all the following criteria: 
1.  Genetic Diagnosis: All patients must have had confirmatory mutational analysis showing G608G 
mutation in the lamin A gene. 
2.  Patients with progeroid laminopathies showing clinical signs of progeria but with other confirmed 
mutations in LMNA were eligible for therapy. This population was to be analysed separately from 
those with the classical mutations. 
3.  Patients were to have adequate organ and marrow function as defined by the following parameters: 
−  Blood: absolute phagocyte count (APC) (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] + bands + monocytes 
= APC) > 1,000/μl, Platelets > 75,000/μl (transfusion independent); Haemoglobin >9g/dl. 
−  Renal: creatinine ≤ 1.5 times normal for age or glomerular filtration rate >70 ml/min/1.73m2. 
−  Hepatic: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal for age; serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 
(alanine aminotransferase) (SGPT [ALT]) < and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 
(aspartate aminotransferase) (SGOT [AST]) < 5 x normal range for age. 
−  Prothrombin time (PT)/Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): PT/PTT < 120% upper limit of normal 
or PI approval. 
4.  No overt renal, hepatic, pulmonary disease or immune dysfunction. 
Study 09-06-0298, Triple Therapy/Monotherapy Extension/ProLon2: 
The Triple Therapy study was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the therapeutic 
effect of the prenylation inhibitors pravastatin and zoledronic acid in combination with lonafarnib for 
children with HGPS or PL for a planned duration of 24 months.  
The triple therapy patient cohort (Group 1) was treated for up to 60 months with lonafarnib, 
pravastatin, and zoledronic acid.  
Following the discontinuation of the triple therapy treatment (based on Interim Analyses 1), the study 
was amended (Protocol Amendment v10.0) to continue treatment of patients in Group 1 with 
lonafarnib alone (Group 1 Monotherapy Extension).  
A second cohort of treatment naïve patients were also enrolled and treated with lonafarnib 
monotherapy (Group 2 or ProLon2). Prolon2 patients were to be assessed for a duration of 24 months 
and were offered a 12-month extension. This was to allow Prolon2 patients to be evaluated for up to a 
total of 36 months of therapy. 
In- and exclusion criteria were similar to Study 07-01-0007.

Treatments 
In all studies for treatment naïve patients, Lonafarnib was initiated at a dose of 115 mg/m2 before 
increasing to 150 mg/m2 after approximately 4 months if the therapy was tolerated. Lonafarnib was 
administered via capsules twice daily. For patients that could not swallow the capsules whole, the 
capsule contents could be dissolved in Ora Blend SF or Ora-Plus.  
Patients experiencing significant drug-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity at any time during treatment and 
not responding to treatment interruption or supportive care measures were to reduce their dose by one 
dose level in the range of 150 to 70 mg/m2, with a possibility to increase the dose again after all of the 
symptoms had returned to baseline.  
In the triple therapy group, pravastatin and zoledronic acid were added. Pravastatin was administered 
orally, once daily at 5 mg for patients weighing <10 kg or 10 mg for patients weighing >10 kg, and 
zoledronic acid was administered via intravenous infusion over 30 minutes (0.0125 mg/kg at baseline 
and 0.05 mg/kg at 6, 12, and 18 months, and study end). 
Following the discontinuation of Triple Therapy treatment with pravastatin and zoledronic acid, 36 
Group 1 patients were enrolled to participate in the Monotherapy Extension (18 patients who continued 
from ProLon1 and 18 patients who were initially drug naïve and received triple therapy). Two 
monotherapy extensions were implemented: an initial 24-month extension and subsequently a 12-
month continuation, for a total of 36 months of monotherapy. As a result, Group 1 patients were 
treated with lonafarnib 150 mg/m2 BID with the morning and evening meals for up to 96 months (up 
to 60 months as part of the triple therapy and 36 months as a monotherapy). 
Lonafarnib monotherapy treatment was expanded to include 40 treatment-naïve patients (Prolon2). 
Prolon2 patients were assessed for a duration of 24 months and were offered a 12-month extension. 
This would allow Prolon2 patients to be evaluated for up to a total of 36 months of monotherapy. Of 
the 40 patients planned, 35 treatment naïve patients were enrolled and received lonafarnib 150 
mg/m2 BID with the morning and evening meals.

Objectives 
Study 07-01-0007  
Primary Objective 
The primary objective was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of oral lonafarnib in patients with HGPS. 
Activity was assessed by determining the change in rate of weight gain over baseline determined pre-
treatment for each patient. 
Secondary Objectives 
• To describe any acute and chronic toxicities associated with lonafarnib in patients with HGPS. 
• To assess changes in leptin levels, glucose utilization, skeletal abnormalities consisting of bone 
mineral density and X-ray findings, joint contracture and function, hearing loss, dental anomalies, 
dermatologic changes including hair density, nutrition with calorie analysis and energy expenditure, 
body composition analysis by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan, and cardiovascular 
function. 
Study 09-06-0298 
Primary Objectives  
The primary objective was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of lonafarnib in patients with HGPS and 
PL, where efficacy was to be assessed by determining the change in the rate of weight gain over 
baseline.

The efficacy was further to be assessed by determining the change in ultrasound measures of carotid 
artery adventitia compared to baseline ultrasound of the carotid artery adventitia, determined during 
week one of trial participation for each subject. 
Secondary Objectives  
• To describe any acute and chronic toxicities associated with treating patients with HGPS and PL with 
the combination of zoledronic acid, pravastatin and lonafarnib (Group 1 Triple Therapy).  
• To describe any acute and chronic toxicities associated with treating patients with HGPS and PL with 
lonafarnib monotherapy (Group 1 Monotherapy Extension and Prolon2).  
• To assess changes in skeletal abnormalities, including bone mineral density and X-ray findings, joint 
contractures and function, growth, body composition analysis by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 
(DXA) scan, and cardiovascular structure and function.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Study 07-01-0007 and Study 09-06-0298 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the achievement of at least a 50% increase in the 
annual rate of weight gain.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the following: Changes in Carotid Artery Ultrasonography, 
Changes in Corrected Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (PWVcf), Changes in DXA aBMD, Changes 
in pQCT parameters, Changes in Height, Changes in BMI, Changes in Body Composition by DXA Scan, 
Changes in ABI, and Changes in FMD.  
For Study 09-06-0298 similar endpoints as for study 07-01-0007 supplemented with Changes in 
Echocardio data and Changes in MRI/Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA) Data. 
Statistical methods 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population is the primary efficacy analysis data set and consists of all 
patients who received at least one confirmed dose of lonafarnib (for both studies) and with any post-
baseline efficacy information (in Study 07-01-0007 only). These requirements mean that the 
population selected is a modified intention to treat populations. 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is the achievement of at least a 50% increase in the annual rate of weight gain 
over the rate documented at study entry by the study team. This will be reflected by the proportion of 
patients who achieved at least a 50% in the rate of annual weight gain. The Clopper-Pearson method 
was used to calculate the 95% CI. The proportion will be tested against 5% (Study 07-01-0007) or 4% 
(Study 09-06-0298) at the 0.05 significance level only for the mutation groups classical and overall, 
due to constraints in the sample size.  
Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Most secondary endpoints tested the difference between baseline and end of therapy using the 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The last post-treatment visit for the patient was considered the end of 
therapy visit. Neither Wilcoxon signed-rank test nor McNemar can incorporate information regarding 
different follow-up times. Only the endpoints considered important for the B/R discussion are 
presented, all other endpoints may contribute as an additional benefit for the patient.

•  Changes in Carotid Artery Ultrasonography Echodensity Data:  
The changes in carotid artery USG echodensity was secondary endpoint in both study 07-01-0007 and 
Study 09-060298. Carotid artery density was measured by ultrasound at intima-media, adventitia 
luminal near wall, and adventitia deep near wall.  
Data was analysed at the 10th and 50th percentile. Data at these percentiles did not have white-outs 
and provided data points where differences can be tested for statistical significance. Actual values and 
fold change from baseline to end of therapy were summarized descriptively (n, mean, quartiles, 
standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum) by percentile and site. 
•  Changes in Corrected Carotid Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (PWVcf): 
Propagation time (Δtcf) was calculated by measuring the time lag between the R-wave of the 
simultaneous ECG and the arrival of the arterial pulse at both the carotid (Δtc) and femoral (Δtf) 
arteries. The distance between the carotid and femoral arteries (lcf) was measured and recorded. 
PWVcf was calculated using the formula PWVcf = lcf / Δtcf. 
The actual values and percent change from baseline to end of therapy were summarized descriptively 
(n, mean, quartiles, standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum). 
Multiplicity adjustments 
No adjustments were completed with respect to multiple comparisons and multiplicity for all primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints. So, adjustments for the increased risk of false-positive rate among 
multiple secondary endpoints was not planned. 
Changes in the Planned Analyses 
For Study 07-01-0007 and Study 09-06-0298, several changes had been made to the planned 
analyses and SAP after the data had been collected. It is not clear whether the data were accessed 
and partially analysed when the changes were made. It is noted that the visit windows were 
expanded.  
For the primary efficacy endpoint in Study 07-01-0007, the annualized change from baseline value at 
the end of therapy was planned in Version 2.0 but later removed. 
For Study 09-06-0298, many secondary endpoints were not evaluated since no change was observed 
in the first interim analysis. It is concerning that secondary endpoints that did not show a treatment 
effect at the interim analysis were disregarded. It is noted that the ITT population was changed.

Concomitant medication 
In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, there were 47 (74.6%) patients with at least one 
concomitant medication. The most commonly reported (used by ≥ 20% of patients) concomitant 
medication were analgesics (30 [47.6%] patients), vitamins (28 [44.4%] patients), mineral 
supplements (23 [36.5%] patients), and antidiarrheals, intestinal anti-inflammatory/anti-infective 
agents (13 [20.6%] patients). Nine of 63 patients (14.3%) used a lipid-modifying agent (e.g. 
pravastatin, atorvastatin). 
There was a greater proportion of patients in ProLon1 that reported the use of at least one concomitant 
medication compared to ProLon2 (26 [92.9%] patients and 21 [60.0%] patients, respectively).  
Outcomes and estimation 
Study 07-01-0007, ProLon1 
Primary Efficacy Analysis – Annual Rate of Weight Gain 
The baseline mean (SD) weight gain rate was 0.4011 (0.44011) kg/year, and at the end of treatment, 
this was 0.4032 (0.41607) kg/year. This is not considered a relevant change. The primary endpoint 
was not met. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses - Carotid Artery Ultrasonography 
• 
• 
• 
For the adventitia luminal near wall, the median decrease from baseline in echodensity was -
17.00  (range:  -142.0,  70.0),  p=0.0367  for  the  50th  percentile.  (not  significant  for  10th 
percentile) 
For the adventitia deep near wall, the median decrease from baseline in echodensity was -29.00 
(range:  -173.0,  85.0)  for the  10th  percentile,  p=0.0271.  For  the  50th  percentile,  the  median 
decrease from baseline in echodensity was -42.50 (range: -180.0, 108.0), p=0.0271.  
For the intima media, the median decrease from baseline in echodensity was -15.25 (range: -
109.0, 34.0) for the 10th percentile, p=0.0070. For the 50th percentile, the median decrease 
from baseline in echodensity was -23.50 (range: -98.0, 38.0), p=0.0018.  
For the single PL patient, echodensity of the carotid artery intima media and adventitia deep near wall 
decreased from baseline to end of therapy at both 10th and 50th percentiles.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses - Corrected Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity 
At the end of treatment, PWVcf decreased from a median 12.85 m/sec (range: 7.2, 18.8) at baseline to 
10.50 m/sec (range: 7.6, 12.6) at the end of therapy (normal range 4.8 to 6.6 m/sec for ages 7 years 
and above) (median decrease from baseline of 15.30% [range: -43.6%, 34.1%], p=0.0028, Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test).  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses – Other  
The other clinical endpoints measured, e.g. areal bone mineral density (aBMD), change in height, body 
mass Index (BMI) showed a significant statistically change from baseline.  
Changes  in  Peripheral  Quantitative  Computed  Tomography,  Ankle-Brachial  Index,  Endothelium-
Dependent Flow-Mediated Vasodilation, were not significantly in favour of the treatment. 
During the scientific advice procedure, insight on the quality of life (QoL) for which the Physical and 
Occupational Therapy (COPM) was deemed potentially suitable was requested. Unfortunately, the 
patients did not experience much improvement – except for tolerating heat – on the several items 
measured.

improved with lonafarnib treatment and decreased from a median 7.68 m/sec (range 5.1, 11.5) at 
baseline to 7.32 m/sec (range 4.5, 10.7) at the end of therapy (normal range 4.8 to 6.6 m/s), 
representing a median decrease from baseline of 5.60% (range: -57.7%, 24.7%) (p=0.0171). Normal 
range data are only available for children 7 years of age and older.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses – Other 
For all groups, e.g. group1 triple therapy, Group 1 Triple Therapy Monotherapy Extension and 
Group2/Prolon2 the following general observations were made. 
• 
For height, a statistically significant median increase from baseline to end of therapy was 
observed. 
•  Changes in Ankle-Brachial Index, Endothelium-Dependent Flow-Mediated Vasodilation, and 
Echocardio data did not reveal any significant findings. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant submitted a survival cohort analysis for substantiation, which is considered the pivotal 
study for the benefit/risk discussion. In addition, two supportive datasets for non-OS outcomes were 
provided by the Applicant; Study 07-01-0007 (ProLon1) and study 09-06-0298. 
Survival study 
In the primary survival analysis, 62 patients treated with lonafarnib from the pooled Prolon1 and 
Prolon2 study were matched to patients using randomly selecting (1:1) a match from candidate HGPS 
patients in the natural cohort (NHC) with the sex and continent. Within each matched pair, the value of 
the “age at start of treatment” for the untreated patient was taken the same as that for the lonafarnib 
treated patient. Only patients born in 1991 or after were included in the survival analysis, which was 
justified and agreed with. 
Study 07-01-0007 (ProLon1) and study 09-06-0298 
Prolon1 (Study 07-01-0007) was an open-label, single-arm trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety 
of lonafarnib monotherapy in children (n=29) with HGPS or PL over a minimum period of two years 
(24-30 months, between 2007-2009). In study 07-01-0007 the primary objective focused on annual 
weight changes. 
Following the completion of Prolon1, patients were eligible to enrol in “Study 09-06-0298, Group 1 
Triple Therapy”, the second Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the therapeutic effect of 
the prenylation inhibitors pravastatin and zoledronic acid in combination with lonafarnib for children 
with HGPS or PL (n=47) for a planned duration of 24 months (24-60 months, between 2009-2013). 
The Triple Therapy group consisted of 26 patients from ProLon1 and 21 treatment-naïve patients.  
Consequently, the study design for study 09-06-0298 was amended, pravastatin and zoledronic acid 
were discontinued, but 36 patients continued treatment with lonafarnib monotherapy in “Study 09-06-
0298, Group 1 Monotherapy Extension” (between 2014-2018). Eighteen of these patients were 
originating from Prolon1. 
In parallel, in 2014, a monotherapy group was set up with a cohort of 35 treatment naïve patients 
named “Study 09-06-0298, Group 2 Monotherapy/ProLon2”. These patients were also enrolled into 
the monotherapy extension of Study 09-06-0298, and 1 patient was still ongoing at the time of the 
Assessment report

preparation of data for submission. In study 09-06-0298, the change in ultrasound measures of carotid 
artery adventitia was added to the primary objective of annual weight changes.  
During the conduct of the studies, it was observed that treatment seemed to extend the survival of 
these HGPS patients. Subsequently, the survival analysis was conducted. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered relevant and will select the intended population to 
be treated in clinical practice. They were similar between the studies.  
Prolon1 patients started on lonafarnib monotherapy 115 mg/m2. After 4 months, the dose is escalated 
to 150 mg/m2. When drug-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity is reported, treatment is interrupted, or 
supportive care measures are taken. This is in line with the proposed posology in the SmPC and agreed 
with. In study Prolon2 patients started lonafarnib monotherapy 150 mg/m2; in line with Prolon1, doses 
could be decreased based on toxicity. The dose rationale is weak, but the proposed maintenance dose 
of 150 mg/m2 twice daily is the only dose that has been studied and is the dose for which B/R is 
assessed.   
Weight is not considered to contribute to the survival of the patients as HGPS patients mainly succumb 
due to cardiovascular failure; this endpoint is to be considered irrelevant for the B/R discussion. At 
best, it contributes to the overall benefit of lonafarnib treatment.  
From the secondary endpoints, PWV and carotid echodensity are considered of limited relevance. 
Aforementioned parameters are indicators for cardiovascular problems and maybe predictors of 
cardiovascular failure.  
High PWV is a hallmark of arteriosclerosis. It has been recognized that aortic pulse wave velocity 
(PWV) is a marker of arterial stiffness and, consequently, of cardiovascular outcome (Reusz et al., 
2010).  
Unfortunately, the Applicant did not request CHMP scientific advices in the early stages of clinical 
development, which is a missed opportunity, although the reasons for developing a treatment for 
Progeria are fully understood. In retrospect, a study design in which data was prospectively collected 
and patients were matched, for instance, 1:1, to demonstrate the effect of lonafarnib on cardiovascular 
parameters (e.g. death, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, etc.) might have been advised. 
Nevertheless, as HGPS, non-classic HGPS and PL are ultra-rare diseases, no additional clinical data is 
to be expected in the short term. For this reason, an application for a marketing authorisation under 
Exceptional Circumstances was accepted by CHMP.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Survival  
The median age of death for untreated HGPS is 14.5 years of age and range from 1.5 to 27.5 years.  
The Applicant has presented numerous analyses applying different methods. The different analyses 
show different effects sizes and inferential statistics. The analyses provided by the Applicant were, 
among others, hampered by the post-hoc character, the lack of sufficient patients and follow-up, the 
intercurrent add-on treatments, and the use of historical controls (with only limited information 
available). Matching should preferably have been performed on important prognostic factors. As no 
prognostic factors (except age at the start of treatment and mutation) have been collected for the 
NHC, matching on age and mutation status is considered the best possible.  
Due to the multitude of analyses undertaken and the unclarity of which analysis would be 
methodologically the most appropriate, CHMP asked BSWP for an independent opinion. This opinion 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 101/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was based on information on the study groups, the NHC, and methodological aspects of all performed 
analyses, but without providing results of the analyses. 
The main aspects of the BSWP response are the following:  
The OS results are exploratory (lack of pre-specification and no type I error control). The choice of the 
NHC is not problematic (as it is the only source of external controls), but this does not mean that this 
control group per se closely resembles the study groups (there may be subtle selection mechanisms 
not directly captured by in/exclusion criteria). Immortal time bias is not a problem as the disease 
starts already at birth. Because it is a strong prognostic factor, “credible and clinically meaningful 
results may only be obtained when the age of starting treatment with lonafarnib is included in the 
statistical model”. Given the potential for bias and confounding, estimated effects should be sufficiently 
large despite potential bias. Sensitivity analyses are therefore important. This relates to:  
-  The different study groups should have similar effects or the reasons for difference should be 
understood.  
-  Both HR and RMST as complementary effect measures should show consistently a positive effect. 
-  As the monotherapy period in Prolon 1 and 2 could be shorter than 3 year; also time windows for 
the RMST of 1 and 2 years are of relevance. As an upper-bound for the lonafarnib effect, also the 
time window until ‘last follow-up’ is important. 
-  As no relevant data beyond age (at start), sex, and region are available, BSWP does not see 
possibilities to improve matching algorithms and “.., choosing the control group by 1:1 matching 
and defining time 0 for controls as age of starting treatment for the matching partner as done by 
the applicant appears reasonable”. 
-  Matching or adjusting are both based on the assumption that no unmeasured confounders would 
typically lead to similar estimates “if the matching methods do not substantially reduce the original 
dataset”. Therefore, “Large discrepancies between results obtained via matching versus an adjusted 
analysis would generally raise concerns about the robustness of the results. It should also be noted 
that both approaches are often mixed”. Thus, consistency across these different approaches is 
considered important.  
-  Tipping points analyses using different methods how to choose the matching in the same sex & 
continent stratum (random choice, 50th percentile, least favourite, etc) should show consistently 
positive effects.  
The initial survival analyses presented by the Applicant showed an estimated additional survival of 0.49 
years after 3 years of lonafarnib monotherapy treatment on Prolon 1 and 2 pooled.  
However, based on the most plausible analysis (including those requested by the BSWP) the mean 
RMST after 3 years of treatment increased from 0.44 to 0.47 years (without and with adjustment for 
age at start treatment, respectively). Given the limited information in the datasets, the estimated 
monotherapy effect over 3 years can be down to 0.2 given the 95%-CI.  
Most relevant analysis: 
The BSWP was in favour of a tipping point analysis censored at 3 years. The mean RMST difference for 
treated versus untreated patients using the tipping point analyses was somewhere in the range 
between 0.2 and 0.5 years, all favouring the lonafarnib treated patients.  
An analysis censored at 3 years, fixed 50th percentile matching by mutation status, gender, and 
continent showed a statistically significant difference in restricted mean survival of 0.24 years when 
censored at 3 years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 102/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The analysis showed a statistically significant difference in restricted mean survival 2.5 years at the 
last follow-up (2019 data cut-off). 
A Cox proportional hazards analysis, matched on sex, continent and age at start of lonafarnib 
treatment was conducted on the last follow-up at 1 August 2021, with survival time and start age as 
covariates and study (Prolon 1, Prolon 2, Triple therapy) as a factor. This analysis showed for Prolon1 a 
HR (95% CI) of 0.23 (0.115, 0.457), for Prolon2: 0.35 (0,156, 0.780), and the 18 naïve patients on 
triple therapy (TT): 0.24 (0,084, 0.702).  
As the BSWP expressed uncertainty of using 3-year window for RMST analysis, 1-year and 2-year 
RMST analyses on the Prolon1 and Prolon2 pooled dataset as suggested by BSWP were conducted. The 
survival benefit for 1-year and 2-year follow up are 0.1 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.15; p=0.002) and 0.2 (95% 
CI: 0.07, 0.40; p=0.004), respectively. 
The numerous additional analyses confirmed the improvement in survival of lonafarnib treated patients 
compared to untreated controls during the 3 years monotherapy phase.  
The BSWP favoured using the survival results at last follow-up to have an upper bound of the effects of 
lonafarnib on the survival of the patients. RMST in treated versus random untreated (censored at 1 
August 2021, ProLon1 and ProLon2 Contemporaneous Intention-to-Treat Set [N=144], adjusting for 
age at start treatment along with the original matching methodology) was 4.3 years with a 95%-CI 
from 2.6 to 6.1. Given the limited information in the datasets, the upper bound of the long term effect 
of lonafarnib can be down to 2.6 years in view of the 95%-CI. 
Although the improvement of the mean RMST at last follow up was considered important (by the 
BSWP), the results should be interpreted with some caution as patients underwent additional 
(potentially beneficial) treatments. Based on the most favourable analyses, the mean RMST at last to 
follow-up ranged from 4.3 to 5.2 years.  When in the Cox proportional hazards analysis, only patients 
were included with an age ≤10 years at start of treatment HRs (95% CI) were 0.19 (0.082, 0.430), 
0.22 (0.072, 0.653), 0.13 (0.034, 0.489), for Prolon1, Prolon2 and triple therapy, respectively with all 
results statistically significant. 
Pooling 
Initially, no cause for the seemingly different survival results could be found it was questioned if the 
populations from ProLon1 and ProLon2 could be pooled. No confounder could be identified after a 
detailed assessment of available literature. Therefore from a clinical perspective, there is no reason not 
to pool ProLon1 and ProLon2. To further analyse the observed difference in survival between ProLon1 
and ProLon2, separate survival data for the Prolon1 and Prolon2 studies were requested, including 
using the ‘censoring at adapted follow-up’ and repeated random matching with replacement. This was 
to mitigate possible biases due to the differences in follow-up and the number of available candidates 
for matching. Using these analyses, no statistically significant differences in survival in Prolon1 and 
Prolon2 were observed. Another observation is the much shorter follow-up in Prolon 2 than in Prolon 1, 
blocking a comparison of long-term survival, but not short-term survival. Therefore, there is no reason 
not to pool the Prolon1 and Prolon2 data from a clinical and methodology perspective. 
Further analysis identified age at start of treatment as a possible confounder and effect modifier. The 
first is obvious as a patient started later will have a shorter survival from that point, given the limited 
life span of the patients. 
A difference in age profile at the start of treatment might contribute to the differences between 
ProLon1 and ProLon2 as observed in the Kaplan Meijer curve, for two reasons. First, more patients with 
a starting age >10 years were included in Prolon 2, that died much earlier. Second, the remaining 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 103/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients in Prolon 2 were comparatively younger at the start of treatment than in Prolon 1. Combined 
with the shorter follow-up in Prolon 2, the Prolon 2 patients' ages at follow-up are mostly not yet in the 
range where the largest contrast with NHC is expected. Therefore, the differences in age distribution 
might serve as a reasonable explanation for the observed differences. The Applicant was previously 
requested to submit an analysis of patients starting before the age of 10 for ProLon1 and ProLon2 
(unrevised) separate and combined contrasted against NHC; these analyses indeed confirmed better 
survival result when considering the younger patients and more similar curves (both early separation).  
Additional data in the NHC 
There is no additional data on cardiovascular or other parameters available for the patients in the NHC. 
Therefore, this cannot be used for matching, which is unfortunate. When considering age at treatment 
initiation and mutation status as important for matching (besides sex and region) in a heterogenous 
Progeria population, Prolon1 and Prolon2 patients are separately be compared to NHC.  
The reason why treated patients did not continue the treatment or were withdrawn by 
investigator/parent/patient could be related to the treatment. In this case, censoring of the 
discontinuations cannot be regarded as non-informative. The Applicant elaborated on the reasons for 
discontinuation. Six patients discontinued the study due to other reasons than death (e.g. TEAEs n=3; 
withdrawn by a caregiver, n=1; lost to follow-up, n=2), and these occurred only in Prolon 2. Lost-to-
follow-up could be non-informative; TEAEs need not indicate that the patient is dying soon (but is a 
kind of treatment failure), so could be considered non-informative; withdrawal would be considered 
informative, and the impact of one possible death may not be negligible against six recorded deaths in 
Prolon 2. However, the Applicant explained that all these patients are still alive, hence this issue is now 
solved.  
−  Study 07-01-0007 (ProLon1) and study 09-06-0298 
In Prolon1 and Prolon2 patients with classic HGPS (n=60), non-classic HGPS (n=2) and progeroid 
laminopathy (PL) (n=1) were included. Given the ultra-rare nature and the infaust disease progression 
of classical HGPS, the number of included patients suffering from classic HGPS is considered 
acceptable. The Applicant informed that there are 9 HGPS patients and 1 non-classic patient ≤3 years 
of age that started lonafarnib and completed the clinical program. Five patients 3 years of age were 
included in the safety and survival analyses. Vital status for all but 1 of the 10 patients starting 
lonafarnib at ≤3 years of age was known through June 1, 2019. All 9 were known to be alive. Patient 
6378 was lost to follow-up. Seven of the 10 remained on study. 
To demonstrate the importance of lonafarnib treatment on cardiovascular endpoints (change from 
baseline to EOT), additional analyses were conducted in those patients that survived under continued 
lonafarnib treatment and those that were non-survivors despite lonafarnib treatment (see below).  
−  Rate of Weight gain 
The mean annual rate of weight gain did not increase from baseline to end of the study in any of the 
studies. The primary endpoint for both Prolon1 and study 09-06-0298 were not met.  
−  Corrected Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity 
High PWV is a hallmark of arteriosclerosis. Redheuil et al. (2010) found that PWVcf increased from 6.2 
± 0.7 m/s at ages 20–29 years, to values comparable to the HGPS population at ages 60–69 (12.8 ± 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 104/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.9) and over 70 (13.8 ± 5.3 m/s), and exhibited a highly significant relationship with ageing. The 
normal range for PWV in healthy controls is 4.8 to 6.6 m/s.  
In both study cohorts (Prolon1 and Prolon2), the change from baseline to EOT in PWV was statistically 
significant. At baseline the PWV in the ProLon2 group was lower than in ProLon1, median 7.68 m/sec 
(range 5.1, 11.5) and median 12.85 m/sec (range: 7.2, 18.8) respectively. This is due to the younger 
age of the ProLon2 participants creating a difference in disease burden, and thus less improvement is 
to be expected.  
−  Carotid Artery Ultrasonography 
The results for carotid artery ultrasonography echodensity measured at the adventitia luminal near 
wall, adventitia deep near wall and intima-media showed improvement when compared with baseline 
in study Prolon1 and prolon2. The improvement (change from baseline to end of treatment) was 
statistically significant within the group.  
The relevance of the carotid artery ultrasonography echodensity in this respect remains unknown, 
though it is to be noted that improvements in echodensity are observed for some patients individually. 
However, PWV and carotid artery echodensity are not standards-of-care and are not validated for 
Progeria patients or the paediatric population. The analysis was performed to better understand the 
impact of cardiovascular parameters to survival. As the data is based on data in treated patients only,  
no firm conclusions can be drawn.  
− 
 Indication 
The indication proposed for ZOKINVY is: 
ZOKINVY is indicated for the treatment:  
• 
• 
of patients 12 months of age and older above with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of 
Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome;  
or a processing-deficient Progeroid Laminopathy associated with either a heterozygous LMNA 
mutation with progerin-like protein accumulation or a homozygous or compound heterozygous 
ZMPSTE24 mutation. 
ZOKINVY is not expected to be effective for the treatment of progeroid syndromes caused by 
mutations in genes other than LMNA or ZMPSTE24 and laminopathies not associated with the 
accumulation of progerin-like proteins. ZOKINVY is not expected to be effective in the treatment of the 
following progeroid syndromes: Werner syndrome, Bloom syndrome, Rothmund–Thomson syndrome, 
Cockayne syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy and ataxia-telangiectasia. 
The indication is based on the survival analysis of the main study including 60 classic HPGS patients 
and 2 non-classic HGPS patients who received lonafarnib monotherapy in study Prolon1 or Prolon2. 
The submitted pivotal analysis indicated an improvement in survival, and additional analyses showed 
improvement of PWV and SBP under lonafarnib treatment which is sufficient as a justification of the 
indication.  
In the complete clinical program, only 4 PL patients were included, with only one patient with PL 
included in Prolon1. PL is even rarer than classic HGPS. Based on extrapolation of in vitro data, 
lonafarnib has a similar effect on misshapen nuclei in human fibroblasts of HGPS and PL patients. In 
addition, limited clinical efficacy data showed that PL patients also had beneficial effects on PWV and 
bone-related parameters. The presence of a farnesylated prelamin A in PLs tends to yield a phenotype 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 105/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that affects the bones more than the cardiovascular system. Therefore, PL patients can be added to 
the indication. The indication is restricted to those PL patients that are either a heterozygous LMNA 
mutation with progerin-like protein accumulation or a homozygous or compound heterozygous 
ZMPSTE24 mutation. 
ZOKINVY is available for patients with a BSA of >0.30 m2.  
−  Registry 
The applicant proposes to conduct a Prospective Observational Study of Patients with Hutchinson-
Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Progeroid Laminopathy. The proposed study will evaluate the safety 
and effectiveness of lonafarnib treatment and quality of life (QoL) among patients with Hutchinson-
Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and Progeroid Laminopathy (PL) within a real-world setting. In 
general, the observational study is welcomed, given that there is no long term follow-up data in HGPS 
patients, and this should provide more insight into the survival under continued lonafarnib treatment. 
In addition, as in the current application very limited data on non-classic HGPS and PL patients were 
submitted, the proposed study will enable collecting additional data in these patients (Specific 
Obligation). 
Additional expert consultation  
CHMP Request to BSWP – February 2022: 
This CHMP request concerns a marketing authorisation application following article 8(3) via the 
centralised procedure for the product lonafarnib.  The Applicant claims that lonafarnib (as 
monotherapy) reduces mortality in patients 12 months of age or older with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria 
Syndrome (HGPS) or Progeroid Laminopathies (PL) with a processing-deficient mutation in LMNA or 
ZMPSTE24.  The evidence provided in this application is based on data from two monotherapy cohorts 
originating from two single-arm, single-center, pivotal studies that did not meet their predefined 
primary endpoint (weight change) and an observational natural history cohort (NHC) population as an 
indirect comparison. The treated cohorts switched to other cohorts of studies with additional 
treatments on top of lonafarnib after the monotherapy period or 3 years.  Age is a known prognostic 
factor for this population. The average lifespan is 14.5 years, and the effect of treatment possibly 
depends on the age at the start of treatment. The Applicant conducted numerous analyses resulting in 
different effect estimates. Consequently, an unambiguous statement about the effect of lonafarnib 
treatment and the magnitude thereof (expressed in terms of prolonged survival) in patients suffering 
from HGPS or PL on survival can currently not be made.

The CHMP asks the Biostatistics Working Party for input on the following questions 
1)  General questions on statistical conduct 
a.  What is the view of the BSWP on the impact of the switch to the survival endpoint (EP) in the 
context of the initial endpoint weight change?  
The switch to the survival EP happened post-hoc after demonstrating a statistically significant but 
clinically unconvincing effect on the initial primary EP of weight change (which may have been 
considered as a surrogate EP by the sponsor). From a statistical point of view, all analyses for the 
survival EP must be considered exploratory due to the lack of pre-specification and T1E control. 
An additional concern is that the survival EP was added completely post-hoc, i.e. was not a secondary 
or exploratory EP in the initial protocol. Usually, post-hoc introduction of an EP raises concerns on 
potentially worse data quality; however, it is expected that the date of death was obtained 
irrespectively of survival not being a formal EP of the study. 
The switch of the primary EP happened when all unblinded results were available and would need to be 
considered data-driven if triggered by the applicant. However, survival as an EP undisputably has the 
potential of being indicative of a major clinical benefit. A mitigating aspect is also that regulatory 
authorities have triggered the change in EP and that the hypothesized surrogate EP of weight change 
was not a complete failure (in the sense that it was statistically significant albeit not considered of 
clinical relevance). Nevertheless, even if triggered by third parties, results may still depend on the 
choice of analysis methods such that the post-hoc specification of methods is of concern. 
Therefore, a demonstration that conclusions do not critically depend on the choice of methods is a 
crucial requirement. Further, replication of findings across the two studies may provide reassurance 
that the observation reflects a true effect, rather than a chance finding. 
Taking into account these arguments as well as considerations about feasibility of performing 
additional studies on lonafarnib in the target population, BSWP considers that the switch of EP may 
exceptionally be acceptable in this setting. However, it is considered that the analysis of the 
survival EP would have to provide very compelling and robust results (which include sufficient 
understanding about prognostic or predictive factors, the biological plausibility of the beneficial effect 
of lonafarnib on survival supported by results of relevant endpoints, as well as potential differences 
between the trials and sensitivity analyses; see also other responses). 
b.  What is the BSWP view on the validity in assessing a treatment benefit in a time-to-event 
endpoint by comparing the survival data for treated single-arm cohorts with the survival data of 
an external Natural History Cohort (NHC)?  
It is generally not possible to conclude on a treatment benefit for a time-to-event EP such as overall 
survival based on the stand-alone results from single-arm trials (SATs). While life expectancy in 
progeria patients is low, BSWP considers that the disease course is not highly predictable, which 
renders the stand-alone interpretation of data on time to death impossible.  
When comparing results from a SAT versus an external comparator, there are general concerns 
concerning bias and confounding since patients in clinical trials usually differ regarding their 
demographic and disease characteristics and background care compared to those treated in practice. 
Age at death can be considered an objective outcome that should be recorded with sufficient 
adequacy both in the trials as well as in the NHC (i.e. no bias introduced due to differences in 
ascertaining the outcome). However, the lack of a very good understanding about the impact of 
baseline and treatment variables on survival makes a comparison very challenging. Furthermore, 
comparison against the NHC will unlikely overcome deficits of the SAT results not being able to 
determine whether a factor is prognostic or predictive of outcome.  
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 107/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exceptionally, for the lonafarnib dossier, the post-hoc choice of the source for external controls 
does not raise any strong additional concern since it is the only available source in this disease setting. 
However, this does not ensure that the control group closely resembles the study groups. In 
general, the more restrictive the in-/exclusion criteria for the trials, the greater the concerns about 
comparability to the control group from the NHC, particularly when in-/exclusion criteria are based on 
information that is not available for the NHC. In addition, there may be subtle selection mechanisms 
not being directly captured by in-/exclusion criteria that are associated with prognosis.  
When comparing data from a SAT to external controls regarding a time-to-event EP, defining ‘time 0’, 
i.e. the start of follow-up, is a particular challenge that has a direct impact on the results. Care must 
be taken to define time 0 such that there is no immortal time bias favouring the experimental 
treatment arm. While the start of treatment is the natural choice for patients from the SATs, the choice 
for control patients is less obvious. The choice should be made to achieve ‘exchangeability’ of treated 
patients and controls, i.e. the expected outcome of the study would be the same for the counterfactual 
scenario in which treated patients and controls were exchanged at time 0. This is closely related to the 
usually unknown ‘history at risk’, i.e. the time since the start of being diseased, which is highly 
prognostic of the disease outcomes. Exceptionally, the history at risk is well characterized in this 
setting where patients are born with the disease. Therefore, choosing the control group by 1:1 
matching and defining time 0 for controls as age of starting treatment for the matching partner as 
done by the applicant appears reasonable. However, exchangeability is given only if all prognostic 
factors are known and considered for matching, which is a strong assumption that cannot be verified.  
In conclusion, survival is one of many EPs that does generally not allow to draw conclusions about 
efficacy based on the stand-alone results from SATs. Given the challenges of assessing the dossier, 
comparison against the NHC may exceptionally support the demonstration of efficacy; 
however, this is associated with many uncertainties (which are not necessarily time-to-event EP 
specific). Statistical comparisons may likely not overcome bias introduced due to external comparison; 
hence estimated effects should be considered sufficiently large and robust so that there is confidence 
about a clinically relevant effect despite potential bias (see also the response to Question 2 b. 
ii). Sensitivity analyses are a minimum requirement to examine the robustness of the results. In 
addition, the plausibility of the assumption of no unmeasured confounding needs to be assessed. 
2)  Specific questions related to data and their analysis 
a.  What is the view of BSWP on whether the two treated cohorts should be pooled or assessed 
individually, also regarding observed differences in age and length of follow-up? 
In general, BSWP considers that pooling of the data from ProLon1 and ProLon2 might – under certain 
circumstances – be acceptable in the context of this very rare disease due to the overall similarities 
of the study populations and study designs as well as the expected increase in precision of effect 
estimates.  
However, it is of high importance that results are also presented by trial and be interpretable as 
such. The results from the separate trials are expected to be consistent and show positive trends. In 
particular, the reasons for any differences between the trials, including the size of effect as well as 
shape of the survival curves, need to be well understood while acknowledging uncertainties due to 
the limited size of the studies. As stated in the Points to consider on appliations with 1. Meta-Analyses; 
2. One pivotal study ‘In particular, a meta-analysis cannot be used to reconcile the conflicting results 
of one positive and one inconclusive study’. 
Differences in calendar time of performing the trials, age of trial participants and length of follow-up 
between the trials may not per se prevent the pooling of the data, but their impact on survival needs 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 108/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to be well-enough understood. Accordingly, the impact of these factors should be taken into 
consideration for the choice of statistical analysis method.  
BSWP does not consider it plausible that the external control (NHC) should be more similar to any of 
the ProLon1 or ProLon2 populations than ProLon1 to ProLon2. Consequently, if there are major 
concerns about pooling the data due to unexplained differences between the trials, BSWP 
considers that the data cannot be meaningfully compared against an external control because in that 
case, the external control would consequently be uncomparable to at least one of the studies.  
b.  Given the data available, can the BSWP recommend a preferred statistical methodology for 
estimating a treatment effect of lonafarnib that is credible, clinically interpretable, and robust?  
In addition, a clear description of the level of uncertainty therein is welcomed.  Finally, what are 
the assumptions and arguments to advise this method, particularly in view of other methods? In 
their response, CHMP will welcome considerations on, including, but not necessarily restricted to: 
i.  What is the view of BSWP on the restricted mean survival time (RMST) method and its 
estimation? Is the definition of a time window (tau) of 3 years versus observed survival time 
methodologically convincing, also considering the (remaining) life expectancy of this pediatric 
population, but also the data dependent time-point of this definition, and including 
considerations on robustness? Often Propensity-score based approach advisable Inverse 
Probability of Treatment Weighting. 
Generally, for time-to-event endpoints, describing the treatment effect by different effect measures 
is meaningful to provide a comprehensive summary.  
Based on the background information about the disease, BSWP considers that credible and clinically 
interpretable results may only be obtained when the age of starting treatment with lonafarnib is 
included in the statistical model. Particularly, effect measures on the absolute scale such as the 
(difference in) RMST may strongly depend on the age of starting treatment simply because remaining 
life expectancy changes with increasing age, i.e. independently from being treated, the life expectancy 
for the next 3 years differs between a 5-year old patient and a 10-year old patient. Sensitivity analyses 
should also be presented to model an interaction term of treatment with age of starting treatment with 
lonafarnib. This is to account for the possibility that age of starting treatment with lonafarnib may 
not only be prognostic but also predictive for the outcome. 
Looking at the model assumptions underlying the Cox proportional-hazards model and the adjusted 
regression-based RMST, BSWP cannot identify concrete concerns about model assumptions that will 
likely be violated and which would hence particularly question the robustness of the results of either 
model. The particular strength of RMST of not requiring the proportional hazards assumption plays an 
important role only if there are strong deviations from the proportional hazards assumption, for which 
there is no a-priori belief for lonafarnib. On the other hand, BSWP considers that the interpretation of 
the difference in RMST as gain/loss of life expectancy may generally be easier to grasp for clinicians 
and patients than a hazard ratio (HR). 
There is usually some degree of arbitrariness when defining a time window for the RMST. In this 
case, the 3-year window was chosen because it was the maximum length of follow-up in the SATs. 
However, as most patients in the lonafarnib group were treated shorter than 3 years (approx. 2 years 
for ProLon1 and 1-3 years for ProLon2), it is unclear whether a robust estimation of the RMST for the 
3-year time window is possible. Therefore, BSWP recommends looking not only at one fixed time 
window but rather results after 1, 2 and 3 years (see also response to Question 2) b. iii).  
Overall, BSWP considers that the RMST (or the difference thereof) and the estimated HR can be seen 
as complementary measures and lack of a convincing estimate for either of those should overall 
raise concerns about the robustness of the results.

ii.  Can BSWP comment on matching to the external cohort versus adjusting in the analysis. If 
matching is desired, can a preferred matching algorithm be advised? 
Before considering matching methods, it is important to understand the comparability of the trial 
populations and the NHC. In particular, it needs to be critically examined what might be potential 
reasons for one patient of the same age being included in the study but not the other (e.g. calendar 
shift, different geographical location, only specific centers recruiting patients, other in-/exclusion 
criteria) as these could lead to a selection bias and confounding when comparing the cohorts.  
The pool of potential controls from the NHC should usually be restricted to patients that would 
have been eligible to participate also in ProLon1 and ProLon2 based on the in-/exclusion criteria. This 
will likely not be feasible in the comparison for lonafarnib due to the small comparator pool and that 
not all data may be available in the NHC. Consequently, it needs to be considered whether there 
are any in-/exclusion criteria that are known or suspected to be so strongly prognostic of the outcome 
and where this would warrant at least a partial restriction of eligible control patients. In that context, 
restriction to contemporaneous controls is important, however, additional restrictions may be 
warranted based on clinical judgement of potential confounders. A descriptive comparison of the 
demographics and disease characteristics in the SATs and the (matched) NHC including information 
about missing data are a minimum requirement.  
Regarding the preference of matching to the external cohort or adjusting in the analysis, no definite 
recommendation for either method is made by BSWP as both are based on similar assumptions and 
usually lead to similar conclusions if the matching method does not substantially reduce the original 
dataset. Large discrepancies between the results obtained via matching versus an adjusted analysis 
would generally raise concerns about the robustness of the results. It should also be noted that both 
approaches are often mixed, i.e. patients are matched but analysis is still adjusted. Importantly, both 
matching and adjusting the analysis rely on the assumption of no unmeasured confounding. This 
assumption can generally not be verified, however, knowledge and availability of data on important 
prognostic factors is a key issue for assessing the plausibility of the assumption.  
The matching algorithms used by the applicant only match patients by age, sex and geographic region; 
however, there will be other (known) confounders. Consequently, matching or adjusting only for these 
confounders will have limited value in terms of addressing potential bias in the comparison against the 
NHC. Possibilities for improvements with regard to matching algorithms, e.g. via propensity-score 
based methods, depend on knowledge and availability of data on potential confounders at the time of 
starting treatment with lonafarnib (or similarly, the defined time 0 in controls). If no relevant data 
beyond age, sex and the geographic region were available in the NHC, either because they are not 
measured at all or because these are covariates that change over time and are insufficiently captured 
in the NHC, BSWP would not see possibilities to improve the matching algorithms beyond what was 
already provided.  
Analyses should be adjusted for the age of starting lonafarnib, including sensitivity analyses with a 
treatment by age of starting treatment interaction term (see the response to Question 2 b. i.). Overall, 
sensitivity analyses such as the tipping point analysis provided by the applicant with different 
matching algorithms (some of them designed to bias the comparison in favour of the control) are 
considered important in order to understand the impact of assumptions on the robustness of the 
results. Of note, although such sensitivity analyses will provide reassurance on the size of the 
estimate, they cannot clarify whether the analysis provides an estimate for the effect of treatment or 
for differences in prognosis between the populations. The assumption of no unmeasured confounding is 
key to this issue. 
iii.  What is the BSWP view on the impact of censoring survival times when patients switch to 
treatment combinations from monotherapy? 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 110/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the background information provided, it can be assumed that censoring at the end of 
ProLon1 or ProLon2 is non-informative since the trials ended with patients being given a choice to 
become part of a follow-up trial (Triple Therapy or Lonafarnib + Everolimus). Accordingly, almost all 
patients switched after the end of ProLon1 or ProLon2 and consequently, this does not directly raise 
concerns over censoring survival times after switch to Triple Therapy or Lonafarnib + Everolimus. 
However, it must be noted that the follow-up times differed between the two trials with patients in 
ProLon1 being censored after approximately 2 years, whereas the censoring for ProLon2 patients 
happened in a range of 1 to 3 years. The applicant has chosen to censor survival times after 3 years 
for external controls. How the set of patients at risk of death changes over time may introduce a bias 
in favour of the treatment group. Consequently, BSWP recommends requesting performing sensitivity 
analyses where survival times in the control arm are censored already after 1 or 2 years.  
In addition, the analysis irrespectively of censoring at the switch to treatment combinations is 
also considered of relevance. It is acknowledged that this analysis may not isolate the effect of 
lonafarnib as it cannot be excluded that the additional therapies have an influence on survival. 
However, the analysis may still provide relevant supportive data, particularly additional information on 
long-term effects and the upper bound of the effect.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
There is currently no cure or approved treatment for HGPS or PL, and the median survival for patients 
is 14.5 years. 
The difficulties in studying a new therapy in an ultra-rare condition are acknowledged, and the unmet 
medical need is understood. 
The strategy of the Applicant to demonstrate efficacy during the assessment phase is a concern. The 
presented non-clinical package supported by published data is considered sufficient as non-clinical 
support for the pharmacological rationale. 
The initially proposed primary endpoint - annualised rate of weight change – although statistically 
significant showed no clinically meaningful differences. Given the lack of clinically relevant results, it is 
understandable that the Applicant looked into the collected data to see whether there are additional 
valuable clinical outcomes that can be used in the case of lonafarnib. It was observed that patients 
treated with lonafarnib had a better survival than the survival mentioned in the literature. Therefore, 
the CHMP agreed that the survival analyses are to be the basis for the B/R assessment. Thus, the 
benefit is expected to be based on survival outcomes compared to a natural, historic cohort with all the 
well-known associated caveats and biases (e.g. in general only basic demographics were collected for 
the NHC (age of diagnosis, birth date, date of death, gender, geographical region and mutation status 
if known). According to the ICH-E10 guideline, a natural cohort might be acceptable. As only one (1) 
register, including all known patients with HGPS, is available, this registry was chosen as comparator.  
The initial survival analyses showed that patients who received lonafarnib monotherapy in Prolon1 (P1) 
and in group 2 study 09-06-0298 (P2) and matched to untreated contemporaneous patients (birth date 
≥1991) that there is a beneficial effect of lonafarnib treatment based on the pooled data of P1 + P2 
(data cut-off 1 June 2019). Based on the most plausible analysis (including those requested by the 
BSWP (see above)) the mean RMST after 3 years of treatment increased from 0.44 to 0.47 years. 
Given the limited information in the datasets, the estimated monotherapy effect over 3 years can be 
down to 0.2 in view of the 95%-CI.  
Although the improvement of the mean RMST at last follow-up was considered important (by the 
BSWP), the results should be interpreted with some caution as patients underwent additional 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 111/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(potentially beneficial) treatments. Based on the analysis with the original random matching 
methodology with adjusting for age at start, the mean RMST at last to follow-up is 4.3 with a 95%-CI 
from 2.6 to 6.1.   
Additional support for the clinical effect of lonafarnib are the observed reductions of progerin in 
patients, and the improvements of PWV and echodensity. These add to the totality of clinical evidence 
in favour of lonafarnib. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The lonafarnib for Progeria clinical development program includes two clinical studies that provide data 
for the evaluation of the safety of lonafarnib monotherapy in patients with HGPS and PL; Study 07-01-
0007 and Study 09-06-0298. The results of a third ongoing clinical study, Study 0000170505, are not 
included in this submission. The main focus will be on the naïve patients treated with lonafarnib 
monotherapy (ProLon1 and 2). The overall population (including the patients in the triple therapy 
group (group 1)) will be discussed when relevant and available. 
In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 Combined Safety Population 60 classic HGPS patients (95.2%), 2 patients 
with non-classic HGPS (3.2%) and 1 one patient with PL (1.6%) were presented. The median age of 
patients at baseline was 6.0 years (range: 2, 17 years), with the majority of patients (57 [90.5%] 
patients) 1 to 11 years of age. There was a similar proportion of males (33 [52.4%] patients) and 
females (30 [47.6%] patients).  
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Sixty-three drug naïve patients were enrolled and received at least one confirmed dose of lonafarnib 
(28 patients in Study 07-01-0007 (ProLon1) and 35 patients as part of ProLon2 in Study 09-06-0298). 
These 63 patients are included in the ProLon1 and ProLon2 Combined Safety Population. Of these 
patients, 52 (81.3%) completed the study, and 11 (17.2%) discontinued treatment. Generally, patient 
disposition was similar between ProLon1 and ProLon2; however, the majority of patients who 
discontinued the study were in ProLon2 (9 [25.7%] patients) compared to ProLon1 (2 [6.9%] 
patients).  
The Triple Therapy study (Study 09-06-0298, Group 1) evaluated the therapeutic effect of pravastatin 
and zoledronic acid in combination with lonafarnib for children with HGPS or PL. Forty-seven patients 
(≥1 year of age) were enrolled in Group 1, 38 with classic HGPS, five with non-classic mutations, and 
four with PL. Twenty-six participants had previously received at least 2 years of continuous lonafarnib 
monotherapy in Study 07-01-0007, and 21 were treatment-naïve. The lonafarnib dose was 150 mg/m2 
BID administered orally. 
In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, the median duration of exposure (total days drug taken) 
was 809 days (range: 8, 1148 days). The mean daily dose was 154.67 mg (standard deviation [SD]: 
32.37), and the median daily dose was 149.08 mg (range: 94.55, 239.28 mg). The mean and median 
dosing varied around 150 mg daily. Given a body surface area varying between 0.37 m2 and 0.95 m2, 
the daily dose expressed per surface area is within the expected and advised dosing regimen (the goal 
for treatment was 150 mg/m2). In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, no patient reached the 
proposed SmPC’s capped dose of 300 mg/350 mg daily for patients with HGPS/PL, respectively (daily 
dose range was 94.55, 239.28 mg).  
Overall, of the 84 patients who received lonafarnib treatment, 90.5% were treated for at least one 
year and approximately 50% were treated ≥5 years. To date, 8 (9.5%) patients have been treated for 
≥10 years.

The most frequent reasons for treatment discontinuation were withdrawal by parent/guardian or death 
(4 (36.4%) patients each). Reason for parental withdrawal were intercurrent adverse events (vomiting, 
pneumonia and a combination of elevated ALT and AST, hyperglycaemia, and hypertriglyceridemia).  
The remaining discontinuations were withdrawal of informed consent by a patient and withdrawal by 
the primary investigator with no reason for withdrawal mentioned.  
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
The most commonly reported TEAEs were vomiting (88.9%), nausea (46.0%), diarrhoea (81.0%), 
fatigue (50.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (46%), decreased appetite (47.6%) and headache 
(52.4%). The reported TEAEs were similar between ProLon1 and ProLon2.  
In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, nausea and vomiting were frequently reported TEAEs in 
patients receiving lonafarnib. All cases of treatment-related vomiting and nausea were considered mild 
to moderate. During the first four months of treatment in ProLon1, 19 (67.9%) patients had 
treatment-related vomiting, and 10 (35.7%) patients had treatment-related nausea. By the end of 
therapy, no patients had treatment-related nausea or vomiting. However, a few patients (4 (14.3%) 
patient) required antiemetics or anti-nauseants after those 4 months. 
The majority of the patients in ProLon1 and 2 (about 93%) experienced mild or moderate diarrhoea 
(Grade 1 or 2), requiring no change in the dose of lonafarnib. The diarrhoea appears to be time-
dependent as during the first 4 months, 46 patients (73%) reported diarrhoea. From 4 months on the 
frequency of diarrhoea reported was between 5 and 11.5%. In the ProLon1 group of patients 12 
(42.9%) patients were treated with loperamide. In the ProLon2 group no patients required 
antidiarrheals such as loperamide. 
Treatment-Related Adverse Events 
In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, there were a total of 519 treatment-related TEAEs (TRAEs) 
in 61 (96.8%) patients. The most commonly reported TRAEs are presented in table 19.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Dehydration 
In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, although infrequent, treatment-related dehydration was 
reported in 3 (4.8%) patients. One patient experienced Grade 1 dehydration while the others reported 
Grade 2 dehydration (one patient reported dehydration that was an SAE).  
Eye Disorders 
Preclinical electroretinography findings suggest the potential for impairment of night vision. There was 
1 (2.9%) patient who reported Grade 4 iritis that was considered an SAE; however, it was considered 
not related to the study drug. The patient had a head injury and concussion and subsequently 
developed traumatic iritis with mild optic disc oedema. Overall, there were no patients who 
experienced TRAEs associated with visual disturbances or acuity. 
Haematological Events 
Anaemia,  thrombocytopenia,  leukopenia,  and  neutropenia  are  expected  events  based  on  findings  in 
preclinical studies and have been reported in clinical studies in cancer patients. However, no patients 
experienced TRAEs suggestive of myelosuppression. 
Adverse Events in Other Patient Populations 
Oncology Program 
Over 1,500 oncology patients were treated with lonafarnib prior to the termination of development for 
oncology due to a lack of clear clinical activity. In oncology patients, lonafarnib administered at doses 
above 200 mg BID was associated with dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicities, including nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, and myelosuppression. In combination with chemotherapy, 
myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia) was observed at dose levels above 100 to 150 mg 
BID in previously treated solid tumour patients. In most patients, diarrhoea related to lonafarnib was 
effectively managed with over-the-counter anti-diarrheal agents (e.g., loperamide). In the oncology 
studies of lonafarnib, the most frequently observed AEs in all patients who received lonafarnib 
monotherapy (N=374) were gastrointestinal and were mainly mild to moderate in severity. The most 
frequently reported treatment-related AEs included diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and 
decreased appetite. Similarly, the most frequently reported Grade 4 treatment-related AEs in 
monotherapy studies included diarrhoea, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, and vomiting. 
Hepatitis D Program 
Lonafarnib is being developed to treat HDV infection in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus 
(HBV).  
Lonafarnib has been administered as monotherapy and in combination with RTV in a number of Phase 
1 studies. In addition, lonafarnib + RTV was administered with and without peginterferon alfa-2a (PEG 
IFN-alfa-2a) in a Phase 3 study and with peginterferon lambda-1a (lambda) in a Phase 2 study. 
Lonafarnib was also administered with other therapies in drug-drug-interaction studies. Studies 
evaluating single doses used lonafarnib 50 mg + RTV 100 mg and lonafarnib 75 mg. In multiple-dose 
Phase 1 studies, lonafarnib was administered BID for up to 10 days at doses of 50 mg or 100 mg with 
RTV 100 mg and lonafarnib monotherapy 75 mg and 100 mg. In later phase studies, lonafarnib 50 mg 
and RTV 100 mg BID were administered with and without 180 μg PEG IFN-alfa-2a once weekly (for up 
to 48 weeks), and 180 μg lambda (for up to 24 weeks). 
To date, 281 healthy adult subjects, including 16 otherwise healthy subjects with hepatic impairment, 
and 4 otherwise healthy subjects with renal impairment, and >110 adult patients with HDV have been

administered lonafarnib for up to 48 weeks. In patients with HDV, dose-limiting toxicities include 
diarrhoea, nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain/abdominal pain upper, decreased 
weight/weight loss, decreased appetite, asthenia, fatigue, epigastric pain, and inguinal pain.  
The most common treatment-related side-effects in HDV-infected patients receiving lonafarnib with or 
without RTV were diarrhoea, nausea, fatigue, decreased appetite, vomiting, abdominal pain/abdominal 
pain upper, and weight decreased. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
In ProLon1 and ProLon2, 34 SAEs were reported in 24 (38.1%) patients. The most frequently reported 
SAEs were cerebral ischaemia (6 (9.5%) patients), haematoma (4 (6.3%) patients), myocardial 
infarction (3 (4.8%) patients), and pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, (2 (3.2%) patients, 
each). There was a greater proportion of patients who reported at least one SAE in ProLon1 (12 
(42.9%) patients) relative to ProLon2 (12 (34.3%)). There was 1 (1.6%) patient who reported an SAE 
of iritis.  
There were 6 SAEs that were considered to be treatment-related reported by 5 (7.9%) patients, all in 
the ProLon1 group. Treatment-related SAEs included cerebral ischaemia (2 [3.2%] patients) and 
pyrexia, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, and dehydration 
(1 [1.6%] patients, each). 
Among Group 1 Triple Therapy patients enrolled following ProLon1, there were 4 (15.4%) patients who 
reported at least one SAE (myocardial infarction (n=2), haematoma (n=1) and death (n=1)). Among 
Group  1  Triple  Therapy  treatment  naïve  patients,  2  (9.5%)  patients  reported  at  least  one  SAE 
(pneumonia  and  death,  both  n=1).  None  of  the  SAEs  was  considered  treatment-related  by  the 
Investigator.  
Deaths 
In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, of the 63 patients treated, 5 (7.9%) patients died while 
on study or within 30 days of concluding treatment. There were two deaths due to myocardial 
infarction, one due to a severe stroke leading to death, and one death due to heart failure. In addition, 
there was one death that was associated with disease progression.  
Of the 84 patients who received lonafarnib treatment in the total lonafarnib for progeria safety 
population, a total of 17 (20.2%) patients died while receiving lonafarnib, irrespective of the treatment 
regimen; 14 (16.7%) classic HGPS patients and 3 (3.57%) non-classic HGPS patients. There were no 
deaths in PL patients. The primary causes of death across studies included myocardial infarction (7 
(8.33%) patients), deaths without an associated CTCAE term (not otherwise specified (NOS)) (4 
(4.76%) patients), disease progression (2 (2.38%) patients), heart failure, severe stroke, epidural 
haematoma, and pneumonia (1 (1.19%) patient, each). None of the deaths was considered by the 
investigator to be treatment-related.  
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Overall, there was no clear or consistent pattern of changes in haematology, clinical chemistry or 
urinalysis from baseline to the end of therapy suggestive of an adverse drug effect.  
In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined population, a substantial proportion of haemoglobin, neutrophil 
and lymphocyte counts were elevated at baseline (28.6%, 68.3% and 12.7%, respectively). Four (4)

cases of haematoma were graded as ≥ Grade 3 AE were reported by different patients. No clear signs 
of myelosuppression were reported. 
The only consistent pattern seen was an increase in ALT and AST levels throughout the study. The 
majority of the increases were mild. Of the 14 (22.2%) patients who reported increased ALT, 11 
(17.5%) patients reported Grade 1 increases, and 2 (3.2%) patients reported Grade 3 increases. 
Similarly, of the 18 (28.6%) patients who reported increased AST, 17 (27.0%) patients reported Grade 
1 increases and 1 (1.6%) patient-reported a Grade 3 increase. The Grade 3 increases of ALT and AST 
were also considered SAEs. 
The majority of the treatment-related increases in ALT and AST occurred during the first 8 months of 
treatment, and the frequency of these events decreased as time progressed. 
2.6.8.5.  Vital signs 
Blood pressure 
The overall systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measurements were 
generally age-appropriate throughout the lonafarnib treatment period. Occasional changes from 
baseline for SBP of ≥20 mmHg were seen in 20 (31.7%) patients, and changes from baseline for DBP 
of ≥15 mmHg were seen in 26 (41.3%) patients. However, these were generally isolated occurrences. 
Six of these patients were taking antihypertensive or vasodilator agents. 
ECG 
For ProLon1 patients, ECG measures were to be taken pre-therapy, during week 16, 32, 52, 68, 84, 
and 116, as well as at the end of therapy for all patients, while for ProLon2 patients, ECG measures 
were to be taken pre-therapy and at end of therapy (week 52-156) only if signs or symptoms of 
cardiac disease were present.  
Overall, in the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, there was no meaningful difference between the 
QTcB and QTcF data with the exception of the number of patients with QTc values ≥0.450 sec in males 
or ≥0.460 sec in females. Seven males had on-treatment QTcB ≥0.450 sec and two females had on-
treatment QTcB ≥0.460 sec compared to no patients using Fridericia’s correction. No patients had QTc 
values ≥0.500 sec. 
In ProLon1, three patients had decreases in the QTc interval, whereas 23 patients had ≥0.010-sec 
increases from baseline for QTcB or QTcF. In ProLon2, 8 patients had decreases in either QTcB or QTcF 
interval when compared to baseline. Another 40 patients had ≥0.010-sec increases for QTcB or QTcF.  
Six patients in ProLon1, also reported TEAEs of hypokalaemia. One of the patients in ProLon 2 with an 
increase in QTc interval had an AE of hyperkalaemia. None of the patients reporting hypokalaemia had 
evidence of cardiac rhythm disturbance. 
2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
Age and Gender 
There is a relationship between lonafarnib exposure and age and gender. In a study of healthy adults, 
an analysis of PK parameter values for lonafarnib stratified by the covariates of age (young vs elderly) 
and sex (males vs females) demonstrated that, in general, maximal peak concentrations were 
observed earlier for the young and male subjects relative to elderly and females (Study P02673).  
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 117/140 
 
 
 
 
A meta-analysis was performed in order to understand how patients’ demographics affect lonafarnib 
exposure (07-01-0007). The analysis identified a statistically significant association between exposure 
and height and age for the 150 mg/m2 capsule group. Height and age had an approximate doubling of 
lonafarnib exposures. However, since height increases with age, these are most likely confounding 
covariates. No covariate tested (weight, height, BMI, age) was highly correlated and statistically 
significant across all dose and preparation groups (i.e., capsule and suspension). 
Hepatic Impairment  
Study EIG-LNF-003, a Phase 1, open-label, parallel-group study assessed the effects of mild and 
moderate hepatic impairment on the single-dose PK of lonafarnib 50 mg + ritonavir 100 mg compared 
to healthy matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. Of the 27 subjects, 9 had a mild 
hepatic impairment, 7 had a moderate hepatic impairment, and 11 had no hepatic impairment (i.e., 
matched controls). There were no clinically meaningful changes in mean lonafarnib Cmax and AUC(s) for 
either of the hepatically impaired groups relative to the healthy matched controls.  
Overall, the administration of lonafarnib was generally well-tolerated in both healthy subjects and 
those subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No clinically relevant differences between 
treatment groups were noted, and no new clinically significant safety signals were observed (EIG-LNF-
003).  
Renal Impairment 
PK data indicate the severe renally impaired subjects have clinically meaningful increases for both 
lonafarnib and RTV. 
The incidence of AEs was higher in subjects with severe renal impairment than in their matched control 
group (75.0% vs 0.0%), but it could not be ruled out that these AEs were partly due to the poorer 
health status of the subjects with severe renal impairment. An SAE of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease was reported for 1 patient with severe renal impairment. The outcome was reported as 
recovered/resolved. Overall, the incidence of AEs after treatment with a single dose of lonafarnib + 
RTV was low in this study, and AEs occurred without a specific pattern. No safety concerns were 
observed during the current study (EIG-LNF-006). 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Lonafarnib has not been administered to pregnant or lactating women.  
Overdose 
There have been no reports of an overdose in clinical studies of HGPS and PL patients. A small number 
of oncology patients received an overdose of lonafarnib as a single agent or in combination therapy, 
with  the  highest  reported  dosage  of  800  mg/day.  The  resulting  AEs  (anorexia,  fatigue,  diarrhoea, 
vomiting, dehydration, and AST and ALT elevation) were expected and known to be associated with 
lonafarnib when administered at the recommended dose. 
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
No analysis of immunological events was submitted. 
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that lonafarnib is a potent CYP3A time-dependent and 
mechanism-based inhibitor and moderate CYP2C19 inhibitor. Concomitant administration of lonafarnib 
with sensitive CYP3A or CYP2C19 substrates, including herbal supplements, can increase exposure of 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 118/140 
 
 
 
 
the co-administered medicinal product (i.e., sensitive substrate). Lonafarnib administration with strong 
or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors inducers, including herbal supplements can increase exposures of the 
lonafarnib resulting in risk of clinically significant adverse events or decrease exposure of lonafarnib, 
which may impact efficacy.  
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Three ProLon2 patients (4.8%) patients had TEAEs that led to the discontinuation of the study drug. 
The first patient had pneumonia (that was also reported as an SAE), and the second patient had 
treatment-related vomiting (Grade 2). The third patient had elevated ALT and AST (both Grade 1) that 
were considered treatment related and hyperglycaemia (Grade 3) and hypertriglyceridaemia (Grade 4) 
that were considered not treatment related; as these TEAEs were reported on the last study visit, this 
patient was considered to have completed Study 09-06-0298; however, conservatively, these were 
also considered as TEAEs that led to drug discontinuation.  
The most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation was the withdrawal by parent or guardian or 
death (4 [36.4%] patients each). Of the patients whose parent/guardian withdrew the informed 
consent one did before starting lonafarnib. Of the remaining withdrawals, 3 withdrew the informed 
consent due to adverse events. An additional one withdrew the informed consent him/herself, and two 
patients were withdrawn by the treating physician. No reason for withdrawal was provided for the last 
3 patients. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
No post marketing experience is available for this medicinal product. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety population 
The safety analysis includes all patients from ProLon1 in study 07-01-0007 (first part of ProLon1) and 
all patients from ProLon2 enrolled in study 09-06-0298 (first part of ProLon2). This analysis is provided 
in the ProLon1 and ProLon2 Combined Safety Population. The full safety profile for all patients in Group 
1 Triple Therapy and Group 1 Monotherapy Extension treatment groups, as well as data from those in 
Study 09-02-074 (triple therapy pilot study) and pravastatin in children with HGPS and the ongoing 
lonafarnib + everolimus study (Study 0000170505), are only included in this assessment when 
relevant. 
Safety data from PL and non-classic HGPS patients in the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group was 
limited to n=1 subject and n=2 subjects, respectively. The safety profile in these patients cannot be 
based on these 3 subjects and might be extrapolated from that observed for HGPS.  
The analysis of the ProLon1 & 2 safety population provides the best impression of the safety profile 
possible. Due to the very limited number of patients included in the ProLon1 and ProLon2 Combined 
Safety Population, an analysis including all patients treated with lonafarnib, was presented. The 
emerging safety profile is comparable with that reported for the combined ProLon 1 and 2 analysis. 
One of the issues hampering the assessment of the overall group, including patients treated with 
everolimus, is that both medicinal products exhibit nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea as adverse events. 
The minor differences that can be observed should, therefore, be attributed to the differences in the 
regimen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 119/140 
 
 
 
 
While the Applicant’s position regarding the ethical feasibility of exposing HGPS patients to a non-
active control is acknowledged, the lack of comparative safety data limits the interpretation of the AE 
analyses. As the efficacy is limited in alleviating the signs and symptoms of the underlying condition, a 
thorough discussion comparing the safety data from Study 07-01-0007 and Study 09-06-0298 (group 
2, ProLon2) with a historical (matched) cohort would be helpful. However, it is not possible to compare 
lonafarnib safety data with untreated HGPS patients, as the information relating to the Natural History 
Cohort used for matching was essentially limited to basic demographic characteristics  
Based on the demographic data from the ProLon1 and ProLon2 Combined Safety Population, the 
patients represent the general classic HGPS population currently known. Only two patients with non-
classic HGPS were included, and 1 patient was suffering from PL. It is assumed that the 3 patients 
suffering from non-classic HGPS and PL do not bias the safety profile observed in the ProLon 1 and 2 
studies.  
The claimed indication covers children from 12 months on. It is understood that farnesylation is an 
important step in the processing of a range of cellular proteins. Clinical studies have not uncovered 
findings indicating lonafarnib interferes with the development of human organs; however, renal and 
retinal toxicities and impaired fertility may be potential concerns based on animal studies, and these 
concerns are addressed in the SmPC.   
For the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, the majority of patients (57/63 (90.5%)) were in the 
age group 1 to 11 years as specified in the original submission (which did not include any 1-year-olds). 
As requested, an analysis of AE data for the ProLon1 and ProLon2 study populations split around the 
median age (i.e. age group <7 years vs age group ≥7 years) was submitted. Based on the data and 
clinical narratives provided together with the summary of TEAEs by median age group, no apparent 
trend was seen indicating a difference between age groups split by median age in the frequency or 
severity of TEAEs in the ProLon1 or ProLon2 safety populations. 
Exposure 
Sixty-three (63) drug naïve patients who were enrolled and received at least one confirmed dose of 
lonafarnib (28 patients in Study 07-01-0007 (ProLon1) and 35 patients as part of ProLon2 in Study 09-
06-0298) were included in the ProLon1 and ProLon2 Combined Safety Population. Of these patients, 
52 (81.3%) completed the study, and 11 (17.2%) discontinued treatment.  
Overall, 84 patients received lonafarnib treatment, 90.5% were treated for at least one year, and 
approximately 50% were treated for at least three years and ≥5 years. To date, 8 (9.5%) patients 
have been treated for ≥10 years. As this considers an ultra-rare disease, the number of patients 
should be considered the best possible. However, due to the limited number of patients, the conclusion 
cannot be considered robust. 
The mean and median dosing varied around 150 mg daily. Given a body surface area varying between 
0.37m2 and 0.95 m2, the daily dose expressed per surface area is within the expected and advised 
dosing regimen (the goal for treatment was 150mg/m2). The SmPC provides a table in section 4.2 with 
the recommended dose per BSA.  
The median follow-up was 809 days (range: 8, 1148 days). Taken into consideration that 4 patients 
died 40, 220, 294 and 368 days after the start of the treatment, and 6 withdrew consent after 53, 58, 
150, 667, 670, and 975 days of treatment (the 1 patient who withdrew the consent before any 
treatment started was not included) the follow-up is considered sufficient.  
Discontinuation 
The most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation was the withdrawal by a parent or guardian or 
death (4 (36.4%) patients each).  
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 120/140 
 
 
 
 
The most commonly reported (used by ≥20% of patients) concomitant medication were analgesics (30 
(47.6%) patients), vitamins (28 (44.4%) patients), mineral supplements (23 (36.5%) patients), and 
antidiarrheals, intestinal anti-inflammatory/anti-infective agents (13 (20.6%) patients). 
Some minor differences between ProLon1 and 2 were observed. Most striking is the low use of 
antidiarrheals and/or antiemetics in the ProLon2 population. This was based on the experiences in 
Prolon1 and the triple therapy study; antidiarrheals and/or antiemetics were only prescribed if 
indicated by the physician.  
Adverse events 
The majority (98%) of patients experienced AEs, and the mean number of AEs was 31 and 14 AEs per 
patient in Study ProLon1 and ProLon2, respectively. In ProLon1, a substantial number of study 
subjects (12 patients (42.9%)) were treated with loperamide or anti-emetics. However, GI symptoms 
often improved despite continued therapy, and their incidence declined after dose escalation at Month 
4. Furthermore, only 4 patients discontinued study participation following GI events, and >20 patients 
in the MAP have been treated with lonafarnib for a decade or longer, lending support to long-term 
tolerability. Based on the summary of TEAEs by SOC and PT by Action Taken for the safety population 
within the initial 4 months of treatment, 15/63 (22%) patients required some form of dosing 
adjustment and only 1/63 (2%) patients discontinued treatment. The remaining 14 patients were able 
to complete the study. For 10 patients (10/63, 16%), the action taken was associated with 
gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance, a known and common side-effect of lonafarnib: 1 discontinuation, 3 
dose reductions and 6 dose interruptions. These results are mentioned in the SmPC section 5.1. 
The most commonly reported TEAEs were vomiting (56 (88.9%) patients; grade 1 or 2), diarrhoea (51 
(81.0%) patients, grade 1 or 2), and fatigue (32 (50.8%) patients).  
The majority of the patients reporting diarrhoea (about 93%) experienced mild or moderate diarrhoea 
(Grade 1 or 2), requiring no change in the dose of lonafarnib; however, 12 (42.9%) patients were treated 
with loperamide. The diarrhoea appears to be time-dependent as, during the first 4 months, 46 patients 
(73%) reported diarrhoea. From 4 months on, the frequency of diarrhoea reported was between 5% and 
11.5%.  In  the  ProLon1  group  of  patients,  12  (42.9%)  patients  were  treated  with  loperamide.  In  the 
ProLon2 group, no patients required antidiarrheals.  
During the first four months of treatment in ProLon1, 19 (67.9%) patients had treatment-related 
vomiting and 10 (35.7%) patients reported treatment-related nausea; all AE were mild to moderate. 
After 4 months of treatment, no patients reported treatment-related nausea or vomiting. In proLon1, 
all patients started with antiemetics or anti-nauseants at baseline; after 4 month only a few patients (4 
(14.3%) patients) required antiemetics or anti-nauseants. In ProLon2 (use of antiemetics or anti-
nauseants was not mandatory at start of treatment), no patients required antiemetics or anti-
nauseates. 
Nausea and vomiting are important identified risks of lonafarnib that were not associated with high 
rates of serious complications and mainly occurred during the first few months of treatment. Careful 
management of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea is important to counteract the development of volume 
depletion. This is included as a warning, and additional dosing advice on how to treat these signs and 
symptoms is provided in the SmPC. 
In both the ProLon1 and ProLon2 studies, the total number of TEAEs and the proportion of patients with 
TEAEs declined continuously during the first eight weeks of treatment.  
The Applicant informs that 4 cases of haematoma were graded as ≥ Grade 3 AE; none were associated 
with thrombocytopenia. In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined population, a substantial proportion of 
haemoglobin, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were elevated at baseline (28.6%, 68.3% and 12.7%, 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 121/140 
 
 
 
 
respectively). Inspection of the data reveals that the majority of instances were either marginal 
increases (e.g., haemoglobin 138 g/L (ULN 134 g/L)), or <2x ULN (Listing 1.244.4.1). Given the 
magnitude of the increase, the baseline abnormalities can be considered to be representative of 
physiologic fluctuation and of no clinical significance. 
Serious adverse events 
In ProLon1 & 2 safety population, 34 SAEs were reported in 24 (38.1%) patients. The most frequently 
reported SAEs were cerebral ischaemia (6 (9.5%) patients), haematoma (4 (6.3%)) patients), 
myocardial infarction (3 (4.8%)) patients), and pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, 
(2 (3.2%) patients, each). There was a greater proportion of patients who reported at least one SAE in 
ProLon1 (12 (42.9%) patients) relative to ProLon2 (12 (34.3%)). Six (6) SAEs were considered related 
to lonafarnib. These SAEs included cerebral ischemia (2 (3.2%) patients) and pyrexia, alanine 
aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, and dehydration (1 (1.6%) 
patients, each).  
In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, of the 63 patients treated, 5 (7.9%) patients died. All of 
the patients died due to a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event. None of the deaths was considered 
by the Investigator to be treatment-related. 
Other safety issues 
In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, most of the measured laboratory parameters shifted. 
There was no clear or consistent pattern of changes in laboratory parameters. The most relevant 
changes observed were related to liver function. No cases of Hy’s law were reported in any of the 
studies of lonafarnib. Further, elevations >3xULN were reported in 3 patients in ProLon1 and 6 patients 
in ProLon2 and were only reported for ALT. Only 1 patient in ProLon2 had an ALT excursion >5x ULN; 
the ALT for this patient was 6.1x ULN. No patients in the ProLon1 or ProLon2 populations had increases 
in bilirubin. In general, the larger increases, above 3x ULN, tended to occur within the first 4 months 
following initiation of treatment. 
In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, creatinine clearance was within the normal values for 
age and sex, indicating that most patients had a normal renal function. 
Special patient groups 
The overall analysis of the available safety data indicates a relation between dose, gender, weight and 
age (with age and weight considered confounders).  
According to the Applicant’s PopPK analysis, in patients with HGPS, females had an 18.6% reduction in 
clearance of lonafarnib compared to males of the same size. It is accepted that a difference of such 
magnitude does not in itself support a gender-based dosing recommendation.   
The frequency of adverse events reported in the group of patients with mild to moderate hepatic 
impairment was higher. The more frequently reported adverse events are diarrhoea, nausea, 
abdominal pain, abdominal faeces, oesophageal varices and vomiting. However, the differences 
between treatment groups were not considered clinically relevant. 
The incidence of AEs was higher in subjects with severe renal impairment than in their matched control 
group (75.0% vs 0.0%). Most adverse events reported were vomiting and nausea, an increase in liver 
function parameters and infections. As only the minority of lonafarnib is renally cleared (< 1%), the 
observed imbalance is considered a chance finding. 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022

SmPC 
One patient discontinued the study after 38 days of treatment due to study related vomiting. As 
vomiting is treatment-related and because this adverse event is most severe in the first phase of the 
treatment, this is included as a warning in the SmPC.  
Lonafarnib is a potent CYP3A4 mechanism-based inhibitor. As lipid modifying agents are commonly 
used by HGPS and lonafarnib is expected to increase plasma concentrations of statins, concomitant use 
of lonafarnib with lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin is contraindicated due to an increased risk 
of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Further, concomitant use of lonafarnib with orally administered 
midazolam is also contraindicated. This is reflected in the SmPC and agreed. 
Lonafarnib administration with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, including herbal 
supplements, can increase exposures of the lonafarnib resulting in a risk of clinically significant adverse 
events or decrease exposure of lonafarnib, which may impact efficacy, respectively. Concomitant use 
of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers are contraindicated in the SmPC.  
Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
See discussion on efficacy above for details on the additional data required. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
As HGPS concerns an ultra-rare disease, the number of patients (N=63) should be considered the best 
possible. However, due to the limited number of patients, the conclusions on safety cannot be 
considered robust. 
The safety of lonafarnib was mainly investigated in patients included in Study 07-01-0007 (ProLon1) 
and Study 09-06-0298, ProLon2. Only 63 patients were enrolled and treated in these non-controlled 
studies. Thus, both the study design and the few patients included in the trials limits firm conclusions; 
however, this may be accepted due to the rarity of the disease.  
Most (98.4%) of the patients experienced AEs while treated with lonafarnib, and the majority of these 
patients experienced multiple AEs. The majority of the AEs were reported within the initial 4 months of 
the treatment, and the most commonly reported adverse events comprise gastrointestinal AEs, 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea (all grade 1 or 2). Of the patients reporting diarrhoea 12 
(42.9%) were treated with loperamide. Of the patients reporting nausea/vomiting 4 patients were 
treated with anti-nausea or anti-emetic treatment. The majority of the patients experienced one or 
more moderate/severe AE(s). In the SmPC it is stated that prevention or treatment of vomiting and/or 
diarrhoea with an anti-emetic and/or anti-diarrhoeal medicinal product can be considered, which is 
considered sufficient. 
Serious AEs were reported in 24 (38.1%) patients, including 6 (9.5%) patients with cerebral ischaemia 
and 3 (4.8%) patients with AMI; these SAEs could be related to disease (progression). The SAEs 
related to hepatic function (increased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) were 
considered related to lonafarnib.  
Five (5) patients died during the period under observation. All of the patients died due to a 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event. None of the deaths was considered to be treatment-related by 
the Investigator. 
In the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group, most of the measured laboratory parameters shifted. 
There was no clear or consistent pattern of changes in laboratory parameters.

Concomitant administration of lonafarnib with sensitive CYP3A or CYP2C19 substrates, including herbal 
supplements, can increase the exposure of the co-administered medicinal product (i.e., sensitive 
substrate). In addition, Lonafarnib administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, including herbal 
supplements, can increase the exposure of lonafarnib, resulting in a risk of clinically significant adverse 
events or decreased exposure of lonafarnib, which may impact efficacy, respectively. These are 
contraindicated in the SmPC.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the Package Leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lonafarnib EigerBio Europe Limited 
(lonafarnib) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 
1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU, and as the 
marketing authorisation is approved under exceptional circumstances.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
2.9.3.  Labelling exemptions 
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
- the Group accepted the request due to the ultra-rarity of the diseases and the extremely low number 
of patients.  
The Applicant committed to providing a printed Package Leaflet in each patient’s native language with 
all orders, and will ensure that all HCPs are provided with all native language SmPCs in printed format 
upon request. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lonafarnib is a specific inhibitor of farnesyltransferase (FTI). The proposed indication for lonafarnib 
monotherapy is the treatment of patients 12 months of age and older with a genetically confirmed 
diagnosis of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome or a processing-deficient Progeroid Laminopathy 
associated with either a heterozygous LMNA mutation with progerin-like protein accumulation or a 
homozygous or compound heterozygous ZMPSTE24 mutation. 
Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare multi-systemic “premature ageing” disease in 
which children mostly die of severe atherosclerosis and accompanied cardiovascular complications at 
an average age of 14.5 years. A mean survival of classic HGPS of 12.4 (range: 1.5–27) years was 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 128/140 
 
 
 
 
found in the literature. The incidence of HGPS is approximately 1 in 4 million births with a prevalence 
of 1 in 20 million living individuals. Progeroid laminopathies, rarer than HGPS, are genetically related to 
HGPS and have clinical features that overlap with HGPS, including severe cardiovascular disease. As of 
October 2021, 133 children with the classic HPGS phenotype and 63 patients with progeroid 
laminopathies (who have a mutation in the lamin pathway but do not produce progerin) are known to 
be alive3.  
HGPS is characterized by an increase in arteriosclerosis and vascular wall fibrosis due to the presence 
of progerin. Further, HGPS is characterized by severe failure to thrive, characteristic faces (receding 
mandible, narrow nasal bridge and pointed nasal tip), total alopecia, global lipodystrophy, joint 
contractures, skeletal dysplasia, sclerodermatous skin, dental abnormalities, and low-frequency 
conductive hearing loss. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are no medicinal products approved for the treatment of children with HGPS or PL. Patients are 
given the best standard of care to treat the signs and symptoms. Medications used to treat HGPS 
include low-dose aspirin, statins, antihypertensives, anticoagulants, and various other medications.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
To demonstrate the clinical efficacy of lonafarnib monotherapy 150 mg/m2 capsules twice daily p.o. in 
patients  with  Hutchinson-Gilford  Progeria  Syndrome  and  Progeroid  Laminopathies,  a  survival  cohort 
study was conducted. This survival analysis included 60 classic HGPS patients and 2 non-classic HGPS 
who received lonafarnib monotherapy in studies Prolon1 (n=27) and Prolon2 (n=35). For the primary 
survival  analysis,  HGPS  patients  were  compared  to  untreated  controls  retrieved  from  a  retrospective 
natural history cohort (n=81), matched in pairs (based on sex and continent when possible; the value 
for ‘age at start treatment’ for the untreated patient in a pair was set to the corresponding value of the 
lonafarnib treated patient). During the procedure, numerous additional analyses were submitted. 
Supportive  data  from  two  open-label,  single-arm,  single-site  Phase  II  studies  of  different  design  and 
subgroups  (Study  07-01-0007/Prolon1  and  Study  09-06-0298  group2/Prolon2)  were  submitted.  The 
studies enrolled a global study population of 84 distinct patients from 34 countries across five continents. 
There was no age limitation for enrolment. Among others, changes in Corrected Carotid Femoral Pulse 
Wave Velocity (PWVcf) and Carotid artery ultrasonography echodensity were measured as explorative 
endpoints. In the NHC no data on cardiovascular parameters were collected. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In animal studies and in vitro using human fibroblasts, it was demonstrated that lonafarnib blocks the 
farnesylation of progerin, leading to the formation of more normal nuclei. Furthermore, the reduction 
of abnormal nuclei under lonafarnib was dose-dependent. The improvement of the nuclei morphology 
was also observed in fibroblasts obtained from patients with non-classic HGPS or PL. 
It was demonstrated that progerin levels for the HGPS patients included in studies Prolon1 and Prolon2 
decreased under continued lonafarnib treatment. Progerin levels remained at a low level during 
continued lonafarnib treatment.

The generalizability of the data is high because the study populations in the clinical studies include most 
patients identified with HGPS worldwide as young as 12 months of age. In addition, few patients were 
prematurely discontinued (3 patients) or underwent dose reductions (4 patients) in the combined group 
of lonafarnib treated patients. 
Pooling of Prolon 1 and Prolon 2 is considered sufficiently justified. There were no clinical reasons for 
why  Prolon  1  and  Prolon  2  would  be  different  in  terms  of  inclusion,  and  the  apparent  differences  in 
survival results reported for ProLon1 and 2 are likely the result of a different age profile with ProLon2 
including  older  patients,  which  affect  survival  outcome  as  age  at  the  start  is  currently  identified  as  a 
prognostic factor for the treatment result. 
Survival 
Analysis submitted by the Applicant of the pooled data of Prolon1 and Prolon2 showed some 
improvement in mean survival time (censored at 3 years) in patients with lonafarnib monotherapy as 
compared to untreated controls (estimated mean 2.83 vs 2.34 years; p=0.0002, stratified log-rank 
test; primary analysis as per SAP: censored at 3 years, a randomly selected match without 
replacement). There is no indication that the original matching (Original Random Untreated) with 
adjustment for age at start of treatment is the most optimistic implementation of the random matching 
procedure due to chance, given the 21 implementations of random matching that the Applicant has 
shown. It yields a mean survival benefit of 0.47 years (95% CI: 0.2, 0.7; p-value=0.0005). 
Additional, requested survival analyses censored at 3 years (i.e. the maximum duration of the initial 
monotherapy phase of the studies) were performed using various censoring and matching methods. 
The estimates for RMST vary between 0.44 and 0.47 years (without and with regression adjustment 
for age at start, respectively). Given the limited information in the datasets, the estimated 
monotherapy effect over 3 years can be down to 0.2 in view of the 95%-CI.  
The BSWP was in favour of a tipping point analysis censored at 3 years. The mean RMST difference for 
treated versus untreated patients using the tipping point analyses was somewhere in the range 
between 0.2 and 0.5 years, all favouring the lonafarnib treated patients.  
As the BSWP expressed uncertainty of using 3-year window for RMST analysis, a 1-year and 2-year 
RMST analysis on the Prolon1 and Prolon2 pooled dataset as suggested by BSWP was conducted. The 
survival benefit for 1-year and 2-year follow up are 0.1 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.15; p=0.002) and 0.2 (95% 
CI: 0.07, 0.40; p=0.004), respectively. 
An analysis censored at 3 years, fixed 50th percentile matching by mutation status, gender, and 
continent showed a statistically significant difference in restricted mean survival of 0.24 years when 
censored at 3 years.  
The analysis showed a statistically significant difference in restricted mean survival 2.5 years at the 
last follow-up. 
A Cox proportional hazards analysis, matched on sex, continent and age at the start of lonafarnib 
treatment, was conducted on the last follow-up at 1 August 2021, with survival time and start age as 
covariates and study (Prolon 1, Prolon 2, Triple therapy) as a factor. This analysis showed for Prolon1 a 
HR (95% CI) of 0.23 (0.115, 0.457), for Prolon2: 0.35 (0.156, 0.780), and the 18 naïve patients on 
triple therapy (TT): 0.24 (0,084, 0.702).  
The numerous additional analyses confirmed the improvement in survival of lonafarnib treated patients 
compared to untreated controls during the 3 years monotherapy phase of the analysis.  
The BSWP favoured using the survival results at the last follow-up to obtain an upper bound of the 
longer-term effects of lonafarnib on the survival of the patients. RMST in treated versus random 
untreated (censored on 1 August 2021, ProLon1 and ProLon2 Contemporaneous Intention-to-Treat Set 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 130/140 
 
 
 
 
[N=144]) was 4.3 years with a 95%-CI from 2.6 to 6.1. Given the limited information in the datasets, 
the upper bound of the long-term effect of lonafarnib can be down to 2.6 years in view of the 95%-CI. 
Using age at the start of treatment as a continuous covariate and the original matching methodology, 
the mean survival benefit was 4.7 years.  
When in the Cox proportional hazards analysis only patients were included with an age ≤10 years at 
the start of treatment, HRs (95% CI) were 0.19 (0.082, 0.430), 0.22 (0.072, 0.653), 0.13 (0.034, 
0.489), for Prolon1, Prolon2 and triple therapy, respectively with all results statistically significant. 
PWVcf and carotid artery ultrasonography 
Improvements  (change  from  baseline  to  end  of  treatment)  for  both  PWVcf  and  carotid  artery 
ultrasonography  (echodensity)  –  both  exploratory  endpoints  -  were  statistically  significant  within  the 
group compared to baseline.  
Other clinical endpoints such as weight gain, height gain, and SBP showed marginal improvements.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It is not clear if the potency of lonafarnib is comparable in human and non-clinical species. However,  
proof of concept has been established in vitro.  
The primary studies for ProLon1 and ProLon2 cohorts are two open-label, single-arm, single-site Phase 
II studies of different designs and subgroups (Study 07-01-0007/Prolon1 and Study 09-06-0298 
group2/Prolon2) that did meet their predefined primary endpoint (weight increase). This increase in 
body weight, however, was considered (by the Applicant) clinically irrelevant. 
Sample size 
The sample size is very limited and hampers the interpretation of the results reported. However, given 
the ultra-rare nature of Progeria, the number of 60 classic HGPS patients, 2 non-classic HGPS and 4 PL 
patients included in the clinical studies should be considered the best possible.  
After careful consideration, it is concluded that ProLon1 and ProLon2 can be pooled, although the 
overall effect is mainly driven by the results obtained in ProLon1. 
The exploratory cardiovascular outcomes like PWV and hypotension are well-known indicators for 
cardiovascular complications later in life. In patients suffering from HGPS these could be prognostic. 
For the NHC, this kind of data is not available and cannot be used for matching. 
As no other parameters besides age, gender, region, mutation status (or the lack thereof), date of 
birth/death were collected in the NHC, there are limited possibilities to match patients.  
Survival analysis 
Selection bias cannot be excluded as an external control was used as a comparator, and no 
randomisation could be applied to balance known and unknown confounding factors. 
The initially proposed primary endpoint was discarded during the assessment process.  
The post-hoc strategy of the Applicant to demonstrate survival benefits is a concern. The benefit of the 
treatment is based on survival outcomes of two cohorts from different studies and compared to a 
natural, historical cohort from a third source with all the well-known associated caveats and biases. 
The lack of predefined analysis to support the application jeopardizes the ability to draw robust 
conclusions based on the existing data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 131/140 
 
 
 
 
The appreciation of the results is further complicated by the many different analyses and methods 
submitted by the Applicant, and as a result the BSWP was asked for independent advice on which 
is/are the most adequate analyses. All analyses show different effects sizes. Based on the preferred 
analyses (including those of the BSWP) for the 3-years follow-up (i.e. lonafarnib monotherapy) the 
mean RMST benefit ranges from 0.44 to 0.47 years, and while considering the last FU the survival 
ranges from 2.0 (1.989) tot 5.0 (4.964) years. However, the last FU analyses are further hampered by 
the start and stop of additional treatments that may affect the effect estimates  (e.g., pravastatin + 
zoledronic acid and/or everolimus).  
Pooling ProLon1 and 2 and triple therapy 
When monotherapy data (i.e., up to the first three years of follow-up) from existing ProLon 1 and 2 
cohorts is evaluated separately, the survival found in the ProLon1 cohort and retrospective natural 
history cohort could not confirm the analyses of the ProLon 2 cohort vs NHC when including all NHC 
patients. The age distribution might partly explain that 3 out of 5 of the older patients in Prolon2 died 
during the follow-up period, while none of the patients died in Prolon1.  
After an unplanned interim efficacy analysis, the Applicant initially excluded the patients treated in the 
triple therapy part of study 09-06-0298. As a result, the remaining patients in study 09-06-0298 (to 
become ProLon2) received monotherapy again.  
The planning and handling of the interim analysis of study 09-06-0298 and the missing data points for 
cardiovascular data resulted in GCP-related concerns. Therefore, the interpretation of the explorative 
cardiovascular endpoints should be made with utmost caution. 
Notwithstanding these concerns, an initial request for a GCP inspection was lifted as the survival 
analyses were considered the main source of evidence. 
Cardiovascular parameters 
There is no external control, as in the NHC no cardiovascular data were collected.  
PWV data analysed did not include patients undergoing triple therapy.  
No meaningful differences in carotid echodensity at EOT was observed in the additional responder 
analyses conducted between survivors and non-survivors.  
Carotid echodensity data analysed did not include patients undergoing triple therapy.  
The observed changes in PWV and Carotid echodensity cannot be benchmarked against an untreated 
group of progeria patients.  
Lower age limit 
Study 09-06-0298 (Group 1/Triple therapy and Group 2/ProLon2) included 10 patients ≤3 years of 
age. Of these children, 5 ProLon2 patients were included in the survival and safety analyses. Nine out 
of the 10 patients starting lonafarnib at ≤3 years of age were known to be alive through 1 June 2019. 
One patient was lost to follow-up. Seven of the 10 patients remained on study. The Applicant provided 
an update for the patients with a cut-off date of 1 August 2021. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Sixty-three (63) drug-naïve patients were included in the ProLon1 and ProLon2 Combined Safety 
Population. Of these patients, 52 (81.3%) completed the study, and 11 (17.2%) discontinued 
treatment. The median follow-up was 809 days (range: 8, 1148 days). 
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 132/140 
 
 
 
 
The mean and median dosing varied around 150 mg daily. Given a body surface area varying between 
0.37 m2 and 0.95 m2, the daily dose expressed per surface area is within the expected and advised 
dosing regimen (the goal for treatment was 150 mg/m2).  
Most (98.4%) of the patients experienced AEs while treated with lonafarnib, and the majority of these 
patients experienced multiple AEs. Most patients (96.8%) experienced TRAEs. The majority of the 
patients (79%) experienced one or more moderate/severe AE(s). The most commonly reported TEAEs 
were vomiting (88.9%, grade 1 or 2), nausea (46.0%, grade 1 or 2), diarrhoea (81.0%, grade 1 or 2), 
fatigue (50.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (46%), decreased appetite (47.6%) and headache 
(52.4%). Diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting are reported to be drug-related. “Weight decreased” was 
noted for 17 (27.0%) patients, and transaminase elevations were commonly observed (>50% of 
patients in ProLon1).  
In the ProLon1 group, 12 (42.9%) patients were treated with loperamide or anti-emetics, whereas in 
the ProLon2 group, no patients required antidiarrheals or anti-emetics/antinauseants. Further, the 
frequency of nausea and vomiting decreased over time, with only a few patients reporting treatment-
related nausea or vomiting at the end of the study.  
In ProLon1 & 2 safety population, 34 SAEs were reported in 24 (38.1%) patients. The most frequently 
reported SAEs were cerebral ischaemia (6 (9.5%) patients), haematoma (4 (6.3%)) patients), 
myocardial infarction (3 (4.8%)) patients), pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract infection, 
(2 (3.2%) patients, each), which all could be considered disease-related as the investigators reported 
that these were not drug-related. Six (6) SAEs (cerebral ischaemia (2 (3.2%) patients) and pyrexia, 
alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, and dehydration (1 (1.6%) 
patients, each) were considered related to lonafarnib. 
There was a greater proportion of patients who reported at least one SAE in ProLon1 (12 (42.9%) 
patients) relative to ProLon2 (12 (34.3%)). 
Five (5) patients died during the period under observation. All of the patients died due to a 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event. None of the deaths was considered by the Investigator to be 
treatment-related. 
Most of the measured laboratory parameters shifted in the ProLon1 and ProLon2 combined group. 
There was no clear or consistent pattern of changes in laboratory parameters. Elevations >3xULN were 
reported in 3 patients in ProLon1 and 6 patients in ProLon2 and were only reported for ALT. Only 1 
patient in ProLon2 had an ALT excursion >5x ULN; the ALT for this patient was 6.1x ULN. No patients 
in the ProLon1 or ProLon2 populations had increases in bilirubin. In general, the larger increases, 
above 3x ULN, tended to occur within the first 4 months following initiation of treatment. There were 
no patients with a Hy law case. 
Lonafarnib is a substrate of CYP3A4, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and affects various metabolic enzymes 
and transporters. There is a significant risk of DDIs with lonafarnib, both as victim drug and perpetrator.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Dealing with an ultra-rare disease, the number of patients (N=63) is limited but should be considered 
the best possible. However, due to the limited number of patients, the conclusions on safety cannot be 
considered being robust. No clear or unexpected adverse events were reported in this additional 
analysis. Further, the lack of comparative data and the general high frequency and seriousness of 
morbidity associated with the disease hamper interpretation of the safety findings.  
Assessment report  
EMA/656670/2022  
Page 133/140 
 
 
 
 
The most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation was the withdrawal by parent or guardian or 
death (4 (36.4%) patients each). The remaining patients withdrew due to GI-related adverse events. 
Except for the low use of antidiarrheals and/or antiemetics in the ProLon2 population, only minor 
differences in comedication between ProLon1 and 2 were observed. The difference in the use of 
antidiarrheals and/or antiemetics between both studies can be explained by the fact that in ProLon2, 
these medications were not provided as standard co-medication but only prescribed on medical 
indication. 
The incidence of AEs was higher in subjects with severe renal impairment than in their matched control 
group (75.0% vs 0.0%). The most frequent adverse events reported were vomiting and nausea, an 
increase in liver function parameters and infections. As only the minority of lonafarnib is renally cleared 
(<1%), this observation is considered a change finding. 
There is a discrepancy between the high number of moderate and severe AEs and the low number of 
patients with either dose-reduction or withdrawal from the study due to AEs. This is considered due to 
the temporality of the adverse events; after about 4 months, the most important adverse events 
(vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea and elevated liver function tests) decrease in frequency or are not 
reported at all.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In vitro studies confirmed the proof of concept of lonafarnib and showed that lonafarnib dose-
dependently prevents nuclear blebbing in dermal fibroblasts from HGPS patients.  
Currently, it is poorly understood how progerin accumulation results in HGPS typical cardiovascular 
(CV) complications.  
Non-clinical information demonstrates a linkage between farnesyl transferase inhibition and reduction 
of CV disease in progeria. This conclusion is mainly based on the changes in cardiovascular disease 
seen in transgenic G608G LMNA mice. In these mice the loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (one of 
the CV features seen in progeria) can be prevented by treatment with the farnesyl transferase inhibitor 
(FTI) tripifarnib (Capel et al., 2008). It is also suggested that endoplasmic reticulum stress and 
unfolded protein due to progerin accumulation can lead to loss of vascular smooth muscle cells and, 
consequently, atherosclerosis (Hamzcyk et al., 2019). This mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum stress 
has also been shown to be present in HGPS patient-derived cells.  
The analyses provided by the Applicant were, among others, hampered by the post-hoc character, the 
lack of sufficient patients and follow-up, the intercurrent treatments, and the use of historical controls 
(with only limited information available). Therefore, matching should preferably have been performed 
on important prognostic factors. As no prognostic factors (except age at the start of treatment and 
mutation) have been collected for the NHC, matching on age and mutation status is considered the 
best possible.  
The initial survival analyses showed a beneficial effect of lonafarnib treatment. The estimated 
additional survival is 0.49 years after 3 years of lonafarnib monotherapy treatment. Based on the most 
plausible analysis (including those requested by the BSWP), the mean RMST after 3 years of treatment 
increased from 0.44 to 0.47 years (without and with adjustment for age at start, respectively). Given 
the limited information in the datasets, the estimated monotherapy effect over 3 years can be down to 
0.2 in view of the 95% CI. In other words, 2.4 months of enhanced survival is the most conservative 
estimate consistent with the data according to these new analyses. Although the improvement of the 
mean RMST at the last follow up was considered important (by the BSWP), the results should be 
interpreted with some caution as patients underwent additional (potentially beneficial) treatments. 
Based on the most preferred analysis, the mean RMST at the last follow-up is 4.3 years with a 95% CI 
from 2.6 to 6.1. Given the limited information in the datasets, the upper bound of the long-term effect 
of lonafarnib can be down to 2.6 years in view of the 95% CI. 
The lack of cardiovascular parameters in the NHC and the absence of standardisation in measurements 
prevent comparisons, and limits the added value and potential associations or explanations of 
observed treatment effects on PWV and carotid echodensity.  
Improvements from baseline to EOT in PWV and echodensity as observed in the Prolon1 and Prolon2 
patients suggest some decrease in the risk of cardiovascular complications.  
Diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting occurred mainly in the first 4 months of treatment but were 
manageable with or without medicinal treatment. The GI adverse events during the first 4 months of 
treatment seem not to be expressed in a decreased quality of life. The use of antidiarrheals or anti-
emetics/antinauseants, and potential measures are sufficiently addressed in the SmPC.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The mean improvement of the mean RMST after 3 years of treatment ranges from 0.44 to 0.47 years. 
At the last follow-up, the improvement in mean RMST was 4.3 with a 95%-CI from 2.6 to 6.1. During 
the first 4 months, most patients reported vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. These adverse events 
could be managed with or without medication for most patients. 
Given the modest and not exactly defined improvement of survival after mono-therapy (i.e. at 3 
years), the further improved survival benefit at last follow-up and the manageable vomiting, nausea 
and diarrhoea, it is considered that the treatment should not be withheld from the patients accepting 
the side effects, dominating during the first 4 months of treatment, taking in consideration that the 
size of treatment effect (although positive) is not well-defined.   
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
There is currently no cure or approved treatment for HGPS or PL. The median life span for HGPS is 
about 14.5 years. It is acknowledged that the development of lonafarnib in this rare-occurring 
condition with a high unmet medical need, claiming exceptional circumstances marketing 
authorization, has not been a strict pre-defined development process.  
The proof of concept that lonafarnib inhibits progerin production is demonstrated using animal data 
and in vitro data from human-derived fibroblast cell lines obtained from HGPS patients. In transgenic 
C608G LMNA mice, FTI treatment showed significant improvements in both the ascending and 
descending aorta regarding the increased abundance of vascular smooth muscle cells. The observed 
reduction in cardiovascular disease progression affected all vessels, including the descending aorta, 
ascending aorta, carotid artery, and abdominal aorta. In contrast, there are no indications of improving 
the vascular system or increased survival in the long-term rat or monkey studies.  
Initial postulated research objectives and outcome measures have been adopted based on an iterative 
process of continuously gathering clinical evidence about the medicine's benefits and risks from an 
environment of use and setting.   
It is not likely that the Applicant will be able to collect and provide prospective additional data on the 
efficacy and safety of lonafarnib under normal conditions of use, considering the indication's rarity and 
the proportion of Progeria patients included in a research environment and already treated with the 
product. Therefore, the possibility to conduct additional large co-operative multicentre studies with a 
scientifically sound research design is practically not possible.   
The Applicant used an NHC as a comparator; this is in line with the ICH-E10 guideline (choice of a 
control group in clinical trials), and the data used for matching can be traced back into the patient’s 
dossiers. The NHC is compiled of chart review data of known HGPS patients. In general, it should be 
mentioned that for orphan medicinal products - which were approved in the past - for the natural 
history cohort, limited data was available in most cases. Therefore, the availability of birth date, date 
of death, gender and region may be the best that could have been collected in the case of Progeria. 
Importantly, all patients treated in the clinical program (e.g. Prolon1, Prolon2, triple therapy) and 
those NHC patients matched in the survival analyses (all patients born in or after 1991) are all derived 
from one registry. It is reassuring that the HGPS patients used for matching received similar best 
standard of care; this was confirmed by analysing the survival data of treated and untreated HGPS 
patients born ≥1991 (contemporaneous NHC patients) and those who were alive in 2007.  
As with other orphan diseases it is universally accepted by the scientific community that treatment as 
early as feasible in life may lead to a better perspective for the patient. This also seems to apply to the 
treatment of Progeria. Therefore, to better appreciate the effect on survival for patients with a starting

age <10 years, the Applicant was requested to submit an analysis of patients for ProLon1 and Prolon2 
(unrevised) separate and combined to investigate the influence of age when starting lonafarnib. In this 
analysis, the influence of starting age was assessed not only as a prognostic factor but also as an 
effect modifier; do patients starting at a younger age demonstrate a stronger effect (in terms of 
hazard ratio or difference in restricted mean survival) than patients starting at an older age. The 
analyses suggest that age at start presents as an important prognostic factor but not as an effect 
modifier because the effect of lonafarnib and age on survival follows the proportional hazards 
assumption.  
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, the Applicant requested a marketing 
authorisation under exceptional circumstances in the initial submission. 
It is considered that the Applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication 
applied for is encountered so rarely that the Applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide 
comprehensive evidence. The prevalence of HGPS is 1 in 20 million living individuals, with only about 
132 HGPS patients and 64 patients with progeroid laminopathies (who have a mutation in the Lamin 
pathway but do not produce progerin) alive as of January 2022. Therefore, the requirements for 
accepting a MA under exceptional circumstances are fulfilled and in view of the positive benefit risk 
balance, the recommendation of a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances is 
considered appropriate. 
It is considered important to note that the data suggest that lonafarnib treatment should be initiated 
as soon as a diagnosis is made.  Both age at initiation and PWV are contributing factors to survival, in 
which age and BL PWV seem to have a plausible relationship.  
Patients with progeroid laminopathies and non-classic HGPS 
In the clinical program (Prolon1 and Prolon2) 60 classic HGPS patients were included. However, only 2 
patients with non-classic HGPS and four patients with PL were included in the clinical program. Based 
on limited (pre)clinical data, the results may be extrapolated with some reservation. However, as this 
application is submitted under exceptional circumstances, no additional data in non-classic and PL 
patients is to be collected in the short term, and these patients are in need for treatment; therefore, 
the proposed indication for non-classic and PL patents can be accepted. 
Registry 
The Applicant proposes to conduct a Prospective Observational Study of Patients with Hutchinson-
Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Progeroid Laminopathy. The study will evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of lonafarnib treatment and quality of life (QoL) among patients with Hutchinson-Gilford 
Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and Progeroid Laminopathy (PL) in a real-world setting. The proposal is 
welcomed given that there is no long-term follow-up data in the HGPS patients, and this may hopefully 
provide more insight into the survival under continued lonafarnib treatment. In addition, as in the 
current application very limited data on non-classic HGPS and PL patients were submitted, the 
proposed study will enable the collection of additional data in these patients.

that the benefit-risk balance of Zokinvy is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Zokinvy is indicated for the treatment of patients 12 months of age and older with a genetically 
confirmed diagnosis of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome or a processing-deficient 
progeroid laminopathy associated with either a heterozygous LMNA mutation with progerin-like 
protein accumulation or a homozygous or compound heterozygous ZMPSTE24 mutation. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions:

Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and 
Processing Deficient Progeroid Laminopathies, 
the MAH shall submit the results of a 
prospective observational cohort study based 
on a registry. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that lonafarnib is to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0258/2019 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

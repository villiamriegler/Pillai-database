ProQuad (measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine 
(live)) 
An overview of ProQuad and why it is authorised in the EU 
What is ProQuad an what is it used for? 
ProQuad is a vaccine against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox).  
ProQuad is given to children from 12 months of age to help protect them against measles, mumps, 
rubella, and chickenpox. ProQuad may also be given to children from 9 months of age in certain 
situations, for example as part of a national vaccination programme, during an outbreak or for travel 
to a region where measles is common. 
ProQuad contains attenuated (weakened) viruses for the diseases. How is 
ProQuad used? 
ProQuad is injected into a muscle or under the skin, preferably in the thigh in younger children and in 
the upper arm in older children and adults. Rarely, in a child with a bleeding disorder, the vaccine is 
injected under the skin to prevent excessive bleeding. 
For children above 12 months of age, one ProQuad injection is sufficient for protection against 
measles, mumps and rubella. To protect against chickenpox, a second injection needs to be given 1 to 
3 months after the first one; this can be done either by giving a second dose of ProQuad or by giving a 
vaccine that only protects against chickenpox. 
Children between 9 and 12 months of age should receive a second dose at least 3 months after the 
first dose for adequate protection against measles and chickenpox.  
ProQuad can only be obtained with a prescription. It is used according to official recommendations, 
including recommendations about the number of doses and the interval between them. 
How does ProQuad work? 
ProQuad contains weakened forms of the viruses that cause measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox. 
When a person receives the vaccine, it triggers an immune response against the weakened viruses. 
Later, when the person comes into contact with the actual viruses, the immune system recognises 
them and is already prepared to attack the viruses and so protects the person from the disease.

What benefits of ProQuad have been shown in studies?? 
Because ProQuad contains well known weakened viruses, which are used in other vaccines, the 
company presented data from vaccines that are already on the market. Five main studies were carried 
out in 6,987 healthy children (aged 12 to 23 months). In these studies, after one dose, the response 
rates in children (measuring how well the immune system had responded to the viruses) were: 98% 
for measles, 96 to 99% for mumps, 99% for rubella and 91% for chickenpox. After the second dose, 
the rates were around 99% for measles, 100% for mumps, 98% for rubella, and 99% for chickenpox. 
Another study in 1,620 children from 9 to 12 months of age showed that, after two doses of ProQuad 
given 3 months apart, the immune response against mumps, rubella and chickenpox in children who 
received the first dose at 9 months of age was comparable with those who received the first dose at 12 
months of age. However, children who received the first dose at 9 months of age had a lower immune 
response against measles. 
What are the risks associated with ProQuad? 
The most common side effects with ProQuad (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are fever, 
and pain and erythema (redness) at the site of injection. For the full list of side effects of ProQuad, see 
the package leaflet. 
ProQuad must not be used in children who are hypersensitive (allergic) to any chickenpox vaccine or 
measles, mumps or rubella vaccine, or to any of the other ingredients including neomycin. It must not 
be used in children who have severely weakened immune systems. It must also not be used in a 
pregnant woman. For the full list of restrictions, see the package leaflet. 
Why has ProQuad been approved? 
The European Medicines Agency decided that ProQuad’s benefits are greater than its risks and it can be 
authorised for use in the EU in children above 12 months of age and in certain situations from 9 
months of age, noting that a second vaccination against chickenpox should be given for full protection 
against the disease.  
The Agency also recommended that the vaccine be authorised in children from 9 to 12 months of age 
only in certain situations, for example as part of a national vaccination programme, during an outbreak 
or for travel to a region where measles is common.

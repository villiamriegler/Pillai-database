Pluvicto 
Centralized 
Chemical class: Pluvicto is a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical 
Summary of mode of action:  
Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan is a radioligand therapy that is 
comprised of the therapeutic radionuclide lutetium-177 linked to a 
small molecule that binds with high affinity to PSMA, a 
transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in prostate cancer, 
including mCRPC. Upon the binding of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan to PSMA-expressing cancer cells, the beta emission from 
lutetium-177 delivers therapeutic radiation to the targeted cell, as well 
as to surrounding cells, and induces DNA damage which can lead to 
cell death. 
Important information about its composition:  
Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan is composed of radionuclide 
lutetium-177 which is linked to a small molecule ligand that targets 
and binds with high affinity to PSMA, a transmembrane protein that is 
highly expressed in prostate cancer, including in mCRPC 
[Proposed SmPC] 
Current:  
Pluvicto in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with 
or without androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with progressive prostate-specific 
membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been treated with AR pathway 
inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy.  
Current: The recommended lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan 
dose is 7400 MBq intravenously every 6 weeks (± 1 week) for up to a

total of 6 doses, or until disease progression, or unacceptable 
toxicity. 
Current:  
Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan 1000 MBq/ml solution for 
injection/ infusion.  
One ml of solution contains 1000 MBq of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan at the date and time of calibration.  
The total amount of radioactivity per single-dose vial is 7400 MBq ± 
10% at the date and time of administration. Given the fixed volumetric 
activity of 1000 MBq/mL at the date and time of calibration, the 
volume of the solution in the vial is adjusted between 7.5 mL and 
12.5 mL to provide the required amount of radioactivity at the date 
and time of administration.

2.1 
Indication 
Pluvicto in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with or without androgen 
receptor  (AR)  pathway  inhibition  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
progressive  prostate-specific  membrane  antigen  (PSMA)-positive  metastatic  castration-
resistant  prostate  cancer  (mCRPC)  who  have  been  treated  with  AR  pathway  inhibition  and 
taxane-based chemotherapy.  
PSMA  is  a  transmembrane  protein,  also  known  as  folate  hydrolase  or  glutamate 
carboxypeptidase II. PSMA is highly overexpressed in nearly all prostate cancers, but also has 
restricted  and  several  hundred-fold  lower  expression  in  some  normal  tissues  such  as  the 
duodenal mucosa, proximal renal tubules, and salivary glands (Bostwick et al 1998, Ghosh and 
Heston 2004, Mannweiler et al 2009). Additionally, PSMA overexpression also correlates with 
advanced,  high-grade,  metastatic,  androgen-independent  disease  (Ross  et  al  2003).  The 
differential  expression  of  PSMA  from  tumor  to  non-tumor  tissue  has  resulted  in  numerous 
targeted  strategies  involving  both  disease  localization  using  radioactive  imaging  as  well  as 
therapeutic  intervention,  and  therefore  may  be  an  attractive  target  for  men  with  metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  
When conducted, calculations were based on the assumption that all cases of mCRPC occurred 
in men aged ≥40 years. 
Incidence: 
Within the published data, one study was found reporting the incidence (per 100,000 men) of 
mCRPC  in  Europe  (Thurin  et  al  2020)  and  three  studies  were  found  reporting  number  of

incident cases (n) in Europe (Marteau et al 2014), the UK (Morgan et al 2010) and in the USA 
(Scher et al 2015). 
Thurin  et  al  2020  estimated  the  incidence  of  mCRPC  in  2014  using  the  French  nationwide 
healthcare database (SNDS) by a SNDS extraction of men covered by the general healthcare 
insurance (86% of the French population), and aged ≥40 year. Age-standardized incidence of 
mCRPC was estimated as 21 cases per 100,000 men in 2014. Less than one mCRPC case per 
100,000 was observed in men aged 40-49 and maximum mCRPC incidence was in men aged 
80-89 (175 per 100,000). 
In a study by Marteau et al 2014, the incidence of mCRPC patients was assessed in 8 European 
countries and Australia using several sources including national cancer registries, a literature 
review, and an ad-hoc chart review. Across all 9 countries, 76,200 new patients were diagnosed 
mCRPC over one year. Of those patients, 35% (26,400 patients) went to supportive care without 
receiving any mCRPC targeted therapy (mCRPCTT) while 65% (49,800 patients) received a 
first line mCRPCTT.  
One retrospective study by Morgan et al 2010 reported incidence of mCRPC in the UK using 
the Health Improvement Network (THIN) data collected between 1998 and 2008. Based on an 
extrapolation, the study estimated an annual incidence of 820 mCRPC cases from 2003 to 2007 
in the UK. Assuming the UK population of men aged ≥40 year was ~14,000,000 in 2007, the 
annual incidence would be ~5.8 per 100,000 men aged ≥40. 
Based on a dynamic transition model, Scher et al 2015 estimated the future mCRPC incidence 
in the USA, which was expected to increase by 19% in the base case scenario from 36,100 in 
2009 to 42,970 in 2020. The majority (86%) of new mCRPC cases were from progression of 
nmCRPC. Assuming the USA population of men aged ≥40 years was ~67,000,000 in 2009 and 
~160,000,000 in 2020, corresponding estimated annual incidence per 100,000 men was 53.9 
and 26.9, respectively.  
Prevalence: 
Within the published data, only one study was found to report the prevalence of mCRPC in 
Europe (Thurin et al 2020). Five retrospective studies reported the number of prevalent cases 
in  different  regions  (i.e.,  worldwide  (Parihar  2018),  the  UK  (Hirst  et  al  2012,  Morgan  et  al 
2010), USA (Fuld et al 2018, Scher et al 2015). 
Thurin et al (2020) estimated the prevalence of mCRPC in 2014 by a SNDS extraction of men 
covered by the general healthcare insurance (86% of the French population), and aged ≥40. The 
age-standardized prevalence of mCRPC was estimated as 62 cases per 100,000 men in 2014. 
Less than one mCRPC prevalent case per 100,000 was observed in men aged 40-49 and the 
maximum mCRPC prevalence was in men aged 80-89 (500 per 100,000). 
In a study using country-specific cancer registries from 45 countries, Parihar 2018 estimated 
the first-line mCRPC drug-treatable populations (DTP) by global geographic/economic regions 
over the period 2017-2027. They found an estimated 331,000 first-line mCRPC DTP worldwide 
in 2017 and projected that the first-line mCRPC DTP worldwide will increase by 30% over the 
period 2017-2027, with higher growth across lower-income countries (40%), than across high-
income countries (14%).

One retrospective study by Morgan et al 2010 reported the prevalence of mCRPC in the UK 
using THIN data between 1998 and 2008. Based on an extrapolation, the study estimated that 
the annual prevalence of mCRPC was 1.2% of PC cases (2,600 cases), from 2003 to 2009. If 
we assume the UK population of men aged ≥40 equaled ~14,000,000 in 2007, the prevalence 
would be ~18.6 per 100,000 men. The UK prevalence reported by Morgan et al 2010 was based 
on an extrapolation and is higher than the other estimates identified in this review. As this study 
was  only  presented  as  an  abstract,  limited  details  on  methodology  or  context  for  the 
extrapolation are available, although the abstract concludes that the study findings are consistent 
with other UK studies. 
Two UK based studies (Hirst et al 2012, Morgan et al 2010) reported the proportion of mCRPC 
in the CRPC population from 8.8% to 15.7% (1,821-2,600 PC cases), between 1998 and 2009 
using THIN and General Practice Research Database (GPRD). 
In the US, the estimated prevalence of mCRPC was 2.1% of PC cases (13,818 cases) from 2007 
to 2017 (Fuld et al 2018). Based on a dynamic transition model, Scher et al 2015 estimated the 
prevalence of mCRPC in the US. It was 62,110 in 2009 and estimated to be 76,690 in 2020. 
Assuming  the  USA  population  of  men  aged  ≥40  years  equals  ~67,000,000  in  2009  and 
~160,000,000 in 2020, corresponding annual incidence rate per 100,000 men would be ~92.7 
and ~47.9, respectively. Scher et al 2015 estimated that improved progression-free survival by 
25% in nmCRPC in 2015 would decrease the mCRPC prevalence by 12% in 2020 (from 72,677 
to 68,837). 
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, 
racial and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease: 
Multivariate analyses showed that high occupational physical activity (AOR 6.7, 95% CI 1.3-
35. 1), history of prostatitis (AOR 31.5, 95% CI 9.2-170.5), and old age (over 80 years vs 70 or 
young,  AOR  299.1,  95%  CI  5.3-16985.9)  were  associated  with  higher  risk  of  PC 
(Hosseini et al 2010). 
Obesity  in  general  was  found  to  be  associated  with  more  aggressive  PC  with  higher  risk  of 
biochemical recurrence (HR = 1.20, p = 0.026), risk of CRPC (HR = 2.12, p = 0.026) and risk 
of mortality (HR 3.38, p = 0.0170) (Vidal et al 2017). Another study showed similar results 
where high BMI was associated with a trend for greater risk of progression to CRPC (HR: 3.36, 
95% CI: 0.96-11.71, p=0.063), risk of developing metastases (HR: 3.58, 95% CI: 0.77-16.65, 
p=0.027)  and  a  trend  toward  worse  PCSM  (HR:  8.21  95%  CI:  0.97-69.72,  p=0.119). 
(Keto et al 2012). 
The main existing treatment options: 
There is an urgent need for more effective treatments to improve outcomes for patients with 
mCRPC.  
As per the ESMO practice guidelines (Parker et al 2020), docetaxel is recommended for men 
with mCRPC. In patients with mCRPC in the post-docetaxel setting, abiraterone, enzalutamide 
and  cabazitaxel  are  recommended.  In  patients  with  bone  metastases  from  CRPC  at  risk  for 
clinically  significant  skeletal-related  events  (SREs),  a  bisphosphonate  or  denosumab  is

recommended. 223Ra is recommended for men with bone-predominant, symptomatic mCRPC 
without visceral metastases. 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity: 
Mortality data in prostate cancer is limited across EU. Morgan et al 2010 reported mortality of 
CRPC in the UK. Following the onset of CRPC, the mortality rate was 201.2 per 1,000 patient 
years compared with 86.7 per 1,000 for non-CRPC (Morgan et al 2010).  
Helgstrand and colleagues reported five-year mortality in men with newly diagnosed mPC. The 
5-year overall mortality in the Danish Prostate Cancer Registry cohort after diagnosis of de-
novo metastatic PCa was 78.5% (95% CI, 77.4%-79.5%). In the DaPCaR cohort, 5-year PCa-
specific mortality significantly decreased from 73.4% (95% CI, 71.2%-75.6%) for patients who 
were diagnosed during 1995 through 1999 to 56.8% (95% CI, 54.8%-58.8%; p<.0001) for the 
patients diagnosed during 2005 and 2009 (Figure 28) (Helgstrand et al 2018). 
Five-year PCa mortality was stable in the US for men diagnosed with de novo mPC from 1980-
1994 and increased slightly for the 2005-2008 period; whereas, it decreased significantly by 
16.6%  (p<.0001)  in  the  DaPCaR  cohort  from  diagnosis  period  1995-1999  to  2005-2009 
(Helgstrand et al 2018)  
The majority of men with localized PC died from other reasons (n=11,228, 23.9%) than PC 
(n=4058, 8.6%) during 1985-1994, while the majority of men with metastatic disease (48%) 
died from PC during the same period (Seikkula et al 2017) 
Palliative  radiation  was  the  most  common  symptomatic  skeletal  event  (83%),  followed  by 
spinal  cord  compression  (10%),  pathological  fracture  (6%),  and  surgery  to  bone  (1%)  with 
majority of the patients having ≥2 symptomatic skeletal-related events (Saad et al 2018). 
Important co-morbidities: 
In  the  UK,  the  retrospective  cohort  study  by  Hirst  and  colleagues  used  data  from  General 
Practice Research database to identify patients who were diagnosed with CRPC from July 1999 
until June 2009. Prevalence of comorbidities was evaluated from any qualifying event in the 36 
months pre-CRPC time frame and after CRPC. Hypertension (24.4% and 3.19 per 100 PY), 
dyspnea (19.9% and 7.75 per 100 PY), and anemia (11.2% and 7.66 per 100 PY) were most 
common  comorbidities  with  higher  prevalence  and  incidence  rates  before  and  after  CRPC 
respectively.  Cardiovascular  events  and  diabetes  were  also  relatively  common,  in  line  with 
expectations  of  an  older  male  population;  in  this  population  almost  7%  had  pre-existing 
diabetes.  The  other  most  commonly  reported  comorbidities  in  this  population  are  urinary 
complaints  (hematuria,  urinary  tract  infection,  dysuria,  retention  of  urine,  and  nocturia), 
digestive problems (constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting), 
respiratory infections (cough and chest infection), back pain, leg pain, joint pain (hip, shoulder, 
and knee), chest pain, and cervicalgia (Hirst et al 2012).  
In the United States, using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, of 
the  2,234  patients  with  CRPC  diagnosed  between  2000  to  2011,  most  of  the  patients  had  a 
history of other serious medical conditions on or before the cohort entry date. The most common

comorbidities (present in >20% of patients) were chronic pulmonary disease (42.4%), diabetes 
without chronic complications (41.2%), peripheral vascular disease (37.2%), cerebrovascular 
disease (30.5%), congestive heart failure (28.5%), mild liver disease (22.9%), and renal disease 
(21.8%) (Saltus et al 2019).

Key Safety findings (from non-clinical studies) 
Toxicity 
Single and repeat-dose toxicity: 
Single-dose GLP toxicity studies with unlabeled PSMA-
617 and 175Lu-PSMA-617 in rats and mini-pigs provided 
a systemic no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) at 
the highest doses tested (4.0 mg/kg rat and 1.8 mg/kg 
mini-pig).  
These exposures provide a safety margin of between 
150 and 400-fold relative to the potential maximum 
human dose (0.275 mg) in the average patient with a 
body surface area of 1.7 m2.  
In the repeat-dose GLP toxicity study with unlabeled 
PSMA-617 in rats, the NOAEL was ≥400 µg, the highest 
dose tested. This provides a safety margin of 
approximately 15-fold relative to the potential maximum 
human dose (0.275 mg) in the average patient with a 
body surface area of 1.7 m2. 
Reproductive/Developmental toxicity 
Fertility and embryo-fetal development studies have not 
been conducted with lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan 
as they are not required as per ICH S9 guidance and the 
CHMP Guideline on the nonclinical requirements for 
radiopharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018). 
Carcinogenicity  
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with 
lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan as they are not 
required as per ICH S9 guidance and the CHMP 
Guideline on the nonclinical requirements for 
radiopharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018). 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity/mutagenicity studies have not been 
conducted with lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan as 
they are not required as per ICH S9 and the CHMP 
Guideline on the nonclinical requirements for 
radiopharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018).  
PSMA-617, the unlabeled precursor, was not mutagenic 
in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (AMES 
test). Genotoxicity/mutagenicity studies have not been 
conducted with lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan as 
they are not required as per ICH S9. 
Safety Pharmacology: 
Relevance to human usage 
Based on the current available non-
clinical data, there is no concern 
relevant to human usage. 
Beta, and gamma radiation cause 
deoxyribonucleic acid damage and 
damage male and female germ cells 
and a developing fetus. The risks of 
potential of fetal harm and infertility are 
appropriately communicated in product 
labeling. 
Beta, and gamma radiation cause 
deoxyribonucleic acid damage and are 
inherently carcinogenic. The risk of 
radiation being a carcinogen is 
appropriately communicated in product 
labeling. 
Beta, and gamma radiation cause 
deoxyribonucleic acid damage and are 
inherently genotoxic. The risk of

on behavioural, neurologic or autonomic parameters in 
male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats after single-dose 
administration up to 1.8 mg/kg. 
Respiratory system 
No effects of unlabeled PSMA-617 or 175Lu-PSMA-617 on 
respiratory parameters in male SD rats after single-dose 
administration up to 1.8 mg/kg. 
Drug-drug interactions 
In  vitro  assessments  have  been  carried  out  with  a  test 
solution  containing  unlabeled  PSMA-617  and  175Lu-
PSMA-617, in lieu of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan. 
CYP450 enzymes 
Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan is not a substrate of 
cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. It does not induce 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4, and it does not 
inhibit  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  1A2,  2B6,  2C8,  2C9, 
2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5 in vitro. 
Transporters 
Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan is not a substrate of 
BCRP,  P-gp,  MATE1,  MATE2-K,  OAT1,  OAT3,  and 
OCT2,  and  it  is  not  an  inhibitor  of  BCRP,  P-gp,  BSEP, 
MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
OCT1, and OCT2 in vitro. 
Conclusions:  
The  nonclinical  studies  carried  out  on  unlabeled  PSMA-617  and  175Lu-PSMA-617  (cold 
compound) did not identify any safety concerns. There are risks which are known to be inherent 
with  radiation  (lutetium  (177Lu)  vipivotide  tetraxetan)  such  as  genotoxicity/mutagenicity, 
reproductive/developmental toxicity, and carcinogenicity.

In patients receiving

(e.g. because of a

that the therapeutic

lower, though it also 
remains a possibility 
that the patient would 
still derive benefit due 
to small PSMA-

that escape imaging 
resolution.  
Literature evidence 
suggests that the use 
of lutetium (177Lu) 
vipivotide tetraxetan is 
safe irrespective of 
PSMA status, and does 
not confer an added 
risk of harm in those

Salivary gland toxicity 
Lacrimal glands 
Reason for non-inclusion as an RMP safety concern 
There are no pre-clinical or mechanistic data suggesting risk to the liver.  
Preclinical and clinical experience with lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan showed that liver metabolism of the compound is negligible. 
Hepatotoxicity events in the pivotal VISION study were reported with 
similar incidence in both treatment arms, including high grade events (≥ 
grade 3 events in 2.8% of patients in the lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan +BSoC arm and 2.4% in the BSoC-only arm). There were no 
cases suggestive of drug-induced liver injury.  
Therefore, there is no cause to further investigate this safety topic beyond 
routine pharmacovigilance or to implement risk minimization activities. 
In patients receiving lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan treatment 
despite being PSMA-negative (e.g. because of a false positive result of 
the gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET/CT scan) it is possible that the 
therapeutic benefit would be lower, though it also remains a possibility 
that the patient would still derive benefit due to small PSMA-expressing 
lesions that escape imaging resolution.  
Clinical data indicate that the safety and tolerability of lutetium (177Lu) 
vipivotide tetraxetan is favourable enough not to confer additional risk of 
harm from severe and irreversible effects should it be administered to 
patients who have negative PSMA-expressing lesions, especially as the 
radionuclide would not be bound in such cases and excreted promptly. 
Salivary glands have been shown as a site of PSMA uptake. 
Dry mouth is a very common AE as reported in the pivotal VISION study, 
but appears to be more of a tolerability/ inconvenience issue to patients 
with mostly mild events (majority grade 1, no grade ≥3) rather than a 
safety risk. Data do not suggest an increase in infections or other 
complications.  
Risk is adequately covered by routine labeling. Further data is not 
expected to change knowledge or actions that would impact patient 
safety. 
Lacrimal glands express PSMA receptors and are a site of PSMA 
uptake. Dry eye is a common AE as reported in the pivotal VISION 
study, but these events were mostly of mild severity (grade 1-2), 
reversible and there was no suggestion of enduring impact to patient 
safety.

Risk is adequately covered by routine labeling. Further data is not 
expected to change knowledge or actions that would impact patient 
safety. 
Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation and decreased appetite / 
weight are very common AEs in the pivotal VISION study, but have not 
been shown to be of significant impact on patient safety. 
Risk is adequately covered by routine labeling. Further data not 
expected to change knowledge or actions that would impact patient 
safety. 
No addictive or misuse has been seen. This therapeutic product will only 
be administered by trained/qualified health-care professionals authorised 
to handle radiopharmaceuticals in designated clinical settings. 
Risk is adequately covered by routine labeling. Further data not expected 
to change knowledge or actions that would impact patient safety. 
The risk of misuse and abuse is therefore considered to be of little or no 
impact to the risk-benefit balance of the product and does not warrant 
further investigation or mitigation. 
The proposed indication is for late stage prostate cancer patients with a 
short life-expectancy. Long-term toxicity of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan can be considered to be beyond the horizon of relevance. 
Any long-term toxicity of the product, based on the mechanism of action 
and known risk profile is most likely to be related to renal toxicity and 
second primary malignancies. These are safety concerns in their own 
right with a category 3 study to further characterise them. 
Therefore, “long-term toxicity” as a separate risk is considered to be of 
little to no further impact to the benefit-risk balance of the product in the 
current indication and does not warrant further investigation or mitigation 
beyond routine pharmacovigilance. 
Extravasation is always possible with the administration of intravenous 
agents. There were two reports of infusion site extravasation in the 
lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan +BSC/BSoC arm of the PSMA-617-
01 study (0.4%): two grade 1 episodes in two patients with no report of 
clinical consequences. There are two literature reports of extravasation 
of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide in the forearm in which the events were 
managed without tissue damage. 
Extravasation can be managed by routine medical practice, and the risk 
is adequately covered by routine labeling. Further data is not expected 
to change knowledge or actions that would impact patient safety. 
Extravasation tissue damage is therefore considered to be of little to no 
impact to the benefit-risk balance of the product and does not warrant 
further investigation or mitigation. 
Target patients are often elderly and constitute a large part of the 
population studied (~75%). The safety profile and risks of lutetium (177Lu) 
vipivotide tetraxetan have been evaluated including the elderly, and data 
do not show that this age group constitutes a risk, per se, or missing 
information whose collection would impact the benefit-risk balance. 
Medication errors may include wrong dosing to the patient. The product 
is an intravenous administration of a single-dose vial by a healthcare 
professional in a specialist center. Current manufacturing foresees a 
radioactivity of 1000 MBq/ml at the date and time of production

Reproductive toxicity 
/calibration that will progressively diminish over time. The total amount of 
radioactivity per single-dose vial is 7400 MBq +/-10% at the date and 
time of administration. Inadvertent overdosing is unlikely. Administration 
by an HCP limits the likelihood of confusing products, under-dosing, 
wrong scheduling etc. 
Inadvertent exposure which may be considered a form of medication 
error is categorised separately as a potential risk. 
Medication errors are therefore considered not to be an important safety 
concern. 
Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan is a genotoxic drug by virtue of its 
radioactivity. However, being used in prostate cancer, it will not be given 
to women. Furthermore, the male patients receiving the product are 
predominantly > 60 years old and have been subject to chemical or 
surgical castration. Routine risk minimisation measures addressing the 
use of condoms for sexually active patients are proposed in section 4.6 
of the SmPC. Therefore, this risk is considered not important and does 
not require further characterisation or risk minimisation measures.

Myelosuppression  
Renal toxicity 
Acute disruption of the production of blood cells in the bone marrow as a toxic 
result of the administration of the product may have severe consequences for 
the patient, including severe infections, anemia and bleeding.  
Kidneys are a primary site of PSMA uptake, and lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan is rapidly excreted through the kidneys. Study documents 
recommend good hydration to promote drug wash-out. 
Acute kidney injury and increased serum/blood creatinine are common AEs 
in the pivotal VISION study.  
Given that the kidneys are exposed to PSMA, the long-term toxicity of 
repeated administrations of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan cannot be 
ruled out.

between countries and states.  
Occupational exposure of HCPs, due either to mishaps or during routine 
use, cannot be ruled out.  
While there is currently no data identifying occupational and inadvertent 
exposure as a risk, there is potential for this risk to impact the benefit-risk 
balance in real world use, due to its nature as an invisible risk factor to the 
healthy people in the patient’s environment. 
Radiation tissue damage is known to predispose to the formation of 
malignancies. This would impact benefit-risk balance because of its potential 
for severe disease in the short term or long term.

Missing information 
Missing 
information 
Patients with severe 
renal impairment 
Risk-benefit impact (Reasons for classification as missing information) 
Current data do not include patients with severe renal impairment. Only 
patients with adequate renal function, and also a limited number of patients 
with mild and partly moderate renal impairment were included in clinical trials 
so far (Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min)  
Safety profile in severe renal impaired patients is expected to be different 
from general target population due to estimated extended time of lutetium 
(177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan of renal uptake and renal excretion. This could 
induce more severe renal damage and a possible systemic effect of delayed 
excretion and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions with existing co-
treatments. Slower elimination of renally excreted drugs would be causing 
their accumulation to high plasma levels, potentially leading to toxicity or 
further exacerbating negative effects on the kidneys. Risk anticipated in 
severe renal impairment population include further deterioration and sudden 
drop of renal function, occurrence of acute kidney injury and/or hospital 
admissions and as consequence the need of renal transplant or renal 
replacement therapy.

Biodistribution of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan in pre-clinical models 
has shown activity in the blood in the hours following administration, 
consistent with the i.v. mode of administration. Pre-clinical evidence for 
myelosuppression is not significant, however, ionising radiation from 177Lu 
may have a direct, brief effect on circulating blood cells in patients. 
Dosimetry studies show radiation absorption in the red marrow to varying 
degrees, with the highest in patients with extensive skeletal metastases

Name of the risk 
Evidence source(s) 
and strength of

Characterization of 
the risk: 
Details 
The clinical evidence is strong that treatment of patients with lutetium 
(177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan can cause reversible reductions in blood cell 
counts. Prostate cancer metastases preferentially to the bone, which may 
put the marrow at risk of the effects of radioactivity during the short time of 
exposure. 
Myelosuppression-related events are very common in patients treated with 
lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan. These events are also common in 
patients receiving best standard of care, though less so, suggesting that 
the patient population as a whole is prone to low and fluctuating blood 
counts due to the underlying malignancy, comorbidities and concomitant 
medications. 
• 
In the lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan +BSC/BSoC treatment 
group a total of 251 (47.4%) patients had myelosuppression-
related AEs, of which 27 (5.1%) patients had SAEs, and 3 of them 
were fatal. 
In the BSC/BSoC only group, a total of 36 (17.6%) patient had 
myelosuppression-related AEs, of which one had a serious event, 
and no fatal AEs were reported. 
Patients may be at increased risk if they have: 
• 
•  Recent or concomitant exposure to anti-cancer drugs with 
myelosuppressive actions 
•  Low pre-treatment blood cell counts for any reason 
•  High tumor load, particular with bone metastases 
Risk of adverse effects of low blood cell counts may be reduced by 
delaying administration of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan when blood 
cell counts are low until a time when counts have recovered. 
Blood count monitoring after treatment can identify low blood counts and 
allow corrective measures to prevent clinical complications.

Important Identified risk - Renal toxicity: Other details 
Renal toxicity 
Potential mechanisms 
Details 
Kidney is the primary route of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan 
excretion and a PSMA-expressing tissue. Renal toxicities in this frail, 
elderly patient population can be expected as a consequence of prior 
anti-cancer treatments and the advanced, metastatic disease state. 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Nephrotoxicity (i.e. serious acute kidney injury) was reported in 
literature, as well in company sponsored clinical trials. 
Characterization of the 
risk: 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Preventability 
Data from VISION show that about 5-10% experienced renal AEs 
during treatment in either arm. Patients receiving lutetium (177Lu) 
vipivotide tetraxetan were more likely to have renal events overall, 
though there appeared no difference in the likelihood to experience 
serious or high grade events. No grade 4 or 5 events were reported in 
VISION. 
• 
In the lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan +BSC/BSoC 
treatment group a total of 46 (8.7%) subjects had at least one 
event of renal toxicity, of which 9 (1.7%) patients reported 
SAEs, of which none of them were fatal. 
In the BSC/BSoC only group, 12 (5.9%) subjects had at least 
one event of renal toxicity, of which of which 7 (3.4%) patients 
reported were SAEs, of which none of them were fatal. 
Pre-existing and concomitant conditions: kidney function impairment, 
urinary tract disorders, previous or concomitant nephrotoxic 
treatments  
Physiological changes associated with aging: diminished renal mass, 
reduction in renal blood flow, loss of nephron function 
As per the SmPC, patients are encouraged to remain hydrated, 
increasing oral fluids and urinating as often as possible.

Intracranial hemorrhage  Details 
Potential mechanisms 
It is not currently known if lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan presents 
a direct risk to intracranial vessels or to brain integrity. PSMA is a unique 
membrane  bound  glycoprotein  which  is  overexpressed  manifold  on 
prostate cancer as well as neovasculature of most of the solid tumors, 
but  not  in  the  vasculature  of  the  normal  tissues  (Ghosh  and  Heston 
2004).

• 
Thrombocytopenia may contribute to the risk indirectly by reducing the 
patient’s inherent clotting ability. 
Some events of intracranial hemorrhage occurred in the pivotal VISION 
clinical trial, but also in the comparator group, and no conclusive 
association with lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan was made. 
In the lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan +BSC/BSoC 
treatment group a total of 7 (1.3%) subjects reported at least 
one event of intracranial hemorrhage. Two subjects (0.4%) had 
fatal outcomes (intracranial hemorrhage, subdural hematoma)  
In the BSC/BSoC only group, 3 subjects (1.5%) reported at 
least one event of intracranial hemorrhage, of which one 
patient (0.5%) had a fatal outcome (subdural hematoma).

Details 
Any deviation in institutional good radiation safety practices may lead to

vipivotide tetraxetan.  
Theoretical risk, currently low strength of evidence 
Currently there are no events informing the character of this risk. No 
AEs were reported in the VISION study. 
The administration of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan may result in 
significant  hazard  to  people  close  to  the  patient  (caregivers,  family 
members, etc.). This may be of concern to the immediate family of those 
patients  undergoing  treatment  or  the  general  public  depending  on  the 
level of radioactivity administered. 
Radiation exposure should be minimized to patients, medical personnel, 
and household contacts during and after treatment with lutetium (177Lu) 
vipivotide  tetraxetan  consistent  with  institutional  good  radiation  safety

Second primary 
malignancies 
Details 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Characterization of the 
risk: 
malignancies (RISM) is one of the important late adverse effects of 
conventional radiation therapy. Radiation damage to blood precursor 
cells may potentially cause later malignant transformation.  
Reports of second primary malignancies were reported from VISION 
(as of 27-Jan-2021), and are discussed below 
Additional evidence from literature suggests that around 17%–19% 
of patients who survive a primary malignancy, ultimately develop a 
second primary malignancy. At present radiotherapy contributes to 
only about 5% of the total treatment-related second primary 
malignancies. 
• 
• 
In the lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan +BSC/BSoC 
treatment group a total of 11 (2.1%) subjects reported at 
least one event. One event of CNS metastases had a fatal 
outcome. 
In the BSC/BSoC only group, 2 (1.0%) subjects with AEs 
were reported. The reported malignancies were metastases 
and skin malignancies (melanoma and squamous cell 
carcinoma). There were no TEAEs of hematological 
malignancies, the relatively short time to onset seen in this 
trial does not suggest causal relationship. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Preventability 
The risk of developing a second malignancy may increase with 
exposure to chemotherapy, other radiotherapeutic modalities, with 
age and family history of cancer. 
As per the SmPC, patients are encouraged to increase oral fluids 
and urged to void as often as possible to reduce bladder radiation.

Missing information: Patients with severe renal impairment 
Patients with severe 
renal impairment 
Details 
Evidence source 
Current data do not include patients with severe renal impairment. Only 
patients with adequate renal function were included in clinical trials (Serum 
creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min). 
Preclinical work, dosimetry studies, and clinical experience with lutetium 
(177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan confirmed the kidney expresses PSMA and are 
highly exposed to radiation. 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: 
Risks anticipated in the severe renal impairment population include further 
deterioration and sudden drop of renal function, occurrence of acute kidney 
injury  and/or  hospital  admissions  and  as  consequence  the  need  of  renal 
transplant or renal replacement therapy.

progressive PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
Rationale and study objectives: 
An extension of this pivotal phase 3 study is planned to conduct long-term follow-up for a 12-
month period in subjects still alive and consented for follow up in this study. This long-term 
follow-up period will include the collection of survival and new treatment information, adverse 
events assessment for renal toxicity and secondary malignancies, and results of hematology and 
chemistry testing. During follow-up, patients will be followed for safety and survival. They will 
be  seen  or  contacted  by  a  clinician  every  3  months  (±1  month)  via  phone,  in  person  or  via 
telemedicine visit, email or letter for up to 12 months, until death or until withdrawal of consent, 
whichever occurs first. 
Study design: 
This  is  a  Phase  III,  open-label,  international,  randomized  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and 
safety  of  lutetium  (177Lu)  vipivotide  tetraxetan  in  patients  with  progressive  PSMA-positive 
mCRPC, when administered in addition to BSC/BSoC as compared to BSC/BSoC alone and is 
a Category 3 study commitment. 
Study population: 
Patients  with  progressive  mCRPC,  who  had  received  at  least  one  NAAD  and  who  were 
previously  treated  with  at  least  one,  but  no  more  than  2  prior  taxane-based  chemotherapy 
regimens.

Part V.2. Additional Risk minimization measures 
Additional Risk minimization measures: Patient guide 
Objective: The objective of this educational program is to minimize the important potential 
risk of inadvertent radiation exposure while on lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan therapy 
for  PSMA-  positive  mCRPC.  Additional  guidance/measures,  after  treatment  for  the 
management of inadvertent radiation exposure are included in the patient guide. 
Rationale  for  the  additional  risk  minimization  activity:  Although  inadvertent  radiation 
exposure is mentioned in the Package Leaflet (PL) and clear instructions are provided in the 
PL, a patient guide has been developed to increase the awareness of the patient.  
Target audience and planned distribution path:

•  Planned distribution path: A patient guide will be prepared nationally in line with 
the key safety messages defined in the RMP and with each EU member state’s 
national regulations and legislations. The patient guide will be distributed to 
institutions where lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan is expected to be 
administered in patients. The treating physician is expected to provide the patient 
guide to all patients receiving treatment with lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan. 
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success: 
The effectiveness of the proposed risk minimization measure will be assessed by monitoring in 
the  PSUR  the  reported  frequency  of  the  important  potential  risk  of  inadvertent  radiation 
exposure.

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan for Pluvicto 
(lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Pluvicto. The RMP details important 
risks of Pluvicto, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Pluvicto's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Pluvicto's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Pluvicto should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Pluvicto should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Pluvicto's 
RMP. 
13.1 
Part VI: I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Pluvicto in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with or without androgen 
receptor  (AR)  pathway  inhibition  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
progressive  prostate-specific  membrane  antigen  (PSMA)-positive  metastatic  castration-
resistant  prostate  cancer  (mCRPC)  who  have  been  treated  with  AR  pathway  inhibition  and 
taxane-based chemotherapy.  
Pluvicto 1000 MBq/ml is a solution for injection/infusion. One ml of solution contains 
1000 MBq of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan at the date and time of calibration. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Pluvicto’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Pluvicto’s

Part VI: II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimize or further characterize the risks 
Important risks of Pluvicto, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Pluvicto's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Pluvicto is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
13.2.1  Part VI – II.A: List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Pluvicto  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Pluvicto. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this 
association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
The clinical evidence is strong that treatment of patients with lutetium 
(177Lu)  vipivotide  tetraxetan  can  cause  reversible  reductions  in  blood 
cell  counts.  Prostate  cancer  metastases  preferentially  to  the  bone, 
which may put the marrow at risk of the effects of radioactivity during 
the short time of exposure. 
Patients may be at increased risk if they have: 
•  Recent or concomitant exposure to anti-cancer drugs with 
myelosuppressive actions 
•  Low pre-treatment blood counts for any reason 
•  High tumor load, particular with bone metastases

Important identified risk - Renal toxicity 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups  
Kidneys are a primary site of PSMA uptake, and lutetium (177Lu) 
vipivotide tetraxetan is rapidly excreted through the kidneys. 
Nephrotoxicity (i.e., serious acute kidney injury) was reported in 
company sponsored clinical trials. Given that the kidneys are exposed 
to PSMA, long-term toxicity of repeated administrations of lutetium 
(177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan cannot be ruled out. 
Pre-existing and concomitant conditions: kidney function impairment, 
urinary track disorders, previous or concomitant nephrotoxic 
treatments  
Physiological changes associated with aging: diminished renal mass, 
reduction in renal blood flow, loss of nephron function

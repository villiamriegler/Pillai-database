1.  Introduction 
Currently,  the  registered  strengths  of  Rebif  are  22  µg  and  44  µg  in  0.5  ml.  The  recommended 
posology  of  Rebif  is  44  micrograms  given  three  times  weekly  by  subcutaneous  injection.  The 
currently approved SPC also indicates that: 
"When  first  starting  treatment  with  Rebif,  in  order  to  allow  tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing 
adverse reactions, it is recommended that 8.8 micrograms  (0.1 ml of the 44 micrograms strength or 
0.2  ml  of  the  22  micrograms  strength)  be  administered  during  the  initial  2  weeks  of  therapy,  22 
micrograms  (0.25  ml  of  the  44  micrograms  strength  or  the  total  of  the  22  micrograms  strength)  be 
administered in weeks 3 and 4, and the total of the 44 micrograms strength be administered from the 
fifth week onwards." 
The new strength product will be provided in a “Initiation pack”, containing 6 syringes of the 8.8 µg 
and  6  syringes  of  the  22  µg  presentation,  respectively.  Each  pre-filled  syringe  (1ml)  is  designed  to 
deliver 0.2 ml (for 8.8 µg) or 0.5 ml (for 22 µg) of a sterile, clear aqueous solution. The interferon-ß-
1a  8.8  µg  finished  product  batches  have  been  manufactured  using  the  same  compounding, 
manufacturing  process,  equipment  and  quality  control  procedures  as  for  the  currently  marketed 
Interferon-ß-1a finished product (22 and 44 µg) and are differing only in the syringe fill volume (0.2 
ml instead of 0.5 ml per 22 µg syringe).

Finished product 
Description and composition of the finished product  
Rebif solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe is available in syringes delivering 8.8 µg in 0.2 ml, 
or 22 µg in 0.5 ml, or 44 µg in 0.5 ml. Each pre-filled syringe (1ml) is designed to deliver 0.2 ml (for 
8.8  µg)  or  0.5  ml  (for  22  µg  and  44  µg)  of  a  sterile,  clear  aqueous  solution.  The  compositions  are

Manufacture  
IFN-ß-1a finished product solution for injection in pre-filled syringe is manufactured at the currently 
approved finished product manufacturers. 
Manufacturing process 
IFN-ß-1a solution for injection 8.8 µg / 0.2 ml in pre-filled syringe, is manufactured according to the 
process used for Rebif 22 µg but with a filling volume of 0.2 ml instead of 0.5 ml. 
The same in-process controls are applied for control in the manufacture of all three product strengths, 
except that the filling volume acceptance range is adapted to the target filling volume of 0.2 ml. 
Process validation 
Studies  were  performed  to  demonstrate  that  IFN-ß-1a  solution  for  injection  8.8  µg  in  a  pre-filled 
syringe (0.2 ml fill) manufactured at LSA consistently delivers a product that meets the approved in-
process control and the intended finished product specifications.  
Control of Excipients  
No changes to the approved dossier. 
Control of Finished product 
Compared to the currently approved 22 µg and 44 µg strengths, the specifications were adapted to the 
smaller volume of the 8.8 µg strength as applicable. There are no other changes. 
Reference Standards or Materials

Stability  
Based on the real time stability data a shelf life for the finished product has been accepted. 
3.  Non clinical aspects  
No new data or studies were submitted for this application. 
4.  Clinical aspects 
No new data or studies were submitted for this application.  
5.  Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Close to identical processes are used for manufacture of the 22 µg and 8.8 µg presentations. The use 
of a smaller fill volume is not considered likely to have any large effect on product quality.  
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of 
Rebif in the treatment of “patients with multiple sclerosis and with 2 or more relapses within the last 
two  years.  Efficacy  has  not  been  demonstrated  in  patients  with  secondary  progressive  multiple 
sclerosis without ongoing relapse activity” was favourable and therefore recommended the extension 
of the marketing authorisation for Rebif 8.8 µg and 22 µg.

1.  Introduction 
On 07 April 2017, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study A3L45 for Hexaxim/ Hexacima/ 
Hexyon, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk balance for 
Hexaxim™/Hexacima™/Hexyon™ and that no consequential regulatory action is required. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that A3L45 “Safety and Immunogenicity of Sanofi Pasteur’s DTaP-IPV-HBPRP~T 
combined Vaccine given as a Primary Series of Vaccination in Infants” is a standalone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Licensed product 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Hexaxim™/Hexacima™/Hexyon™ is indicated for active immunisation (primary and booster 
vaccination) of infants and toddlers from six weeks of age against diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), 
pertussis, Hepatitis B (Hep B), poliomyelitis and invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae 
type b (Hib). 
The MAH submitted the final report for: 
A3L45:  
“Safety and Immunogenicity of Sanofi Pasteur’s DTaP-IPV-HBPRP~T combined Vaccine 
given as a Primary Series of Vaccination in Infants” (Russian Federation, Poland) 
Intent of this study was licensure in the Russian Federation. Only one dose of the vaccine was given in 
that country but immunogenicity and safety were assessed. In Poland three doses were given but due 
to the vaccine being licensed here already only safety was assessed. 
This study was not conducted as part of the EU-approved Paediatric Investigational Plan for this 
product (EMEA 001201-PIP01-11-M02).

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
Methods 
Study design 
This clinical study A3L45 is a Phase III, open-label, multi-center one-arm study in 150 infants.  
• 
• 
In the Russian Federation, 1 single dose of DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T vaccine was administered 
between 6 months and 6 months and 29 days of age in infant subjects who had previously 
received through routine medical practice 2 doses of a DTaP-IPV//PRP~T vaccine (Pentaxim) at 
3 and 4.5 months of age (MoA) and 2 doses of a standalone HB vaccine administered within 24 
hours of birth and at 1 MoA per the national vaccination calendar of the Russian Federation. 
In Poland, a 3-doses primary series of DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T vaccine was administered at 6 to 8 
weeks of age, at 3 to 4 MoA, and at 5 to 6 MoA in infant subjects who had received 1 dose of 
HB vaccine administered within 24 hours of birth per the national vaccination calendar of 
Poland. 
Laboratory assays were the same as for the previous studies; analysis was done at the sponsor’s 
laboratory in Swiftwater, USA.

Objectives 
Russian Federation 
To describe the safety and reactogenicity of DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T vaccine after a single 
injection in infants between 6 months and 6 months 29 days of age who had previously 
received 2 vaccinations with DTaP-IPV//PRP~T (Pentaxim) and 2 doses with HB vaccines 
administered at ages recommended by the Russian National Immunization Program. 
To evaluate the immunogenicity of DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T vaccine 1 month after vaccination. 
• 
• 
Poland 
• 
To describe the safety and reactogenicity after each and all doses of DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T 
vaccine administered as a 3-dose primary series. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary: 
•  Occurrence of any unsolicited systemic AEs reported in the 30 minutes after each and all 
dose(s). 
•  Occurrence of solicited (prelisted in the subject’s DC and CRF) injection site and systemic 
reactions occurring through 7 days (D0-D7) following each and all dose(s). 
•  Occurrence of unsolicited AEs through 30 days following each and all dose(s). 
•  Occurrence of SAEs throughout the trial 
•  Other endpoints recorded or derived as described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
Depending on the item, these include: nature (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA] preferred term), time of onset, duration, number of days of occurrence, Grade of 
severity, relationship to vaccine, action taken, whether the AE led to early termination from the 
study, seriousness, or outcome 
Secondary: 
One month (30 to 42 days) after the single dose of study vaccine (D30, Visit 2):  
•

Assessor’s comment: 
The manner of this study with only one dose of Hexyon after two doses of Pentaxim + HepB makes it 
hardly relevant which GMs are achieved. Serological protection thresholds are reached in all cases and 
for all antigens. 
Safety results 
No deaths occurred in this study.  
A total of 3 unsolicited AEs reported by 2 subjects were considered as related to vaccine by the 
Investigator: 
• A subject experienced rash of Grade 2 one day after the second injection. The subject received 
health care and medication. The event resolved after 9 days. This subject also experienced rash 
papular of Grade 1 one day after the third injection. The subject received health care and medication. 
The event resolved after 8 days. 
• A subject experienced injection site rash of Grade 2 two days after the third injection. No action was 
taken. The event resolved after 30 days. 
No SAEs related to the vaccines were reported. No (S)AEs led to discontinuation of the study. 
Otherwise similar event rates were seen for solicited local and systemic events in both groups in known 
frequencies. Frequencies and grades do not increase with additional doses in the polish part of the 
study. 
No safety issues are identified. 
The safety profile remains unchanged. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Due to the nature of the study (only one dose given within immunogenicity part of the study) the 
immunogenicity results are hardly relevant.  
Overall, this study does not add new information regarding the immunogenicity and safety. The safety 
profile remains unchanged.  
3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

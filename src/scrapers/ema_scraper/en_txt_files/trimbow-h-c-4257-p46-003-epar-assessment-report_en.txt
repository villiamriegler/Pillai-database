1.  Introduction 
On 29 July 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for CHF 5993 100/6/12.5 mcg 
pressurised inhalation solution (EMEA/H/C/004257, tradename Trimbow), in accordance with Article 46 
of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measures. A short critical expert has 
also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
CHF 5993 pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) is a fixed dose combination (FDC) of the inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS) beclometasone dipropionate (BDP), the long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) formoterol 
fumarate (FF) and the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) glycopyrronium bromide (GB). 
The medicinal product was first authorised by the European Commission (EC) in July 2017 for the 
maintenance treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by a combination of ICS / LABA. In 
January 2019, the indication was broadened via a type II variation to also include patients not 
adequately controlled by a combination of ICS / LAMA. 
In January 2021, CHF 5993 pMDI 100/6/12.5 was also authorised by the EC for the maintenance 
treatment of asthma patients not adequately controlled by a combination of a LABA and medium dose 
ICS and having experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year. 
The authorised dose regimen for CHF 5993 pMDI 100/6/12.5 in adult patients with COPD and asthma 
is 2 puffs twice daily (bid). 
The development of CHF 5993 pMDI in adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) plans to use the 
commercially available formulation and strength of CHF 5993 approved in adult patients with COPD 
and asthma (dose strength 100/6/12.5 mcg, referred to as medium strength).  
A Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) was initially agreed with the PDCO in May 2019 and modified 
afterwards three times, in November 2019, August 2020 and March 2021, respectively. Due to the 
global Coronavirus pandemic outbreak, execution of the agreed PIP and studies was delayed. 
The clinical pharmacology / PK safety study in scope of this application (study CLI-05993CB1-01) is 
the first out of two clinical studies (to be) conducted by the applicant as part of the agreed paediatric 
investigational plan (PIP, most recent version P/0094/2021 issued on 17MAR2021). The main objective 
of the study was to quantify total systemic exposure to CHF 5993 (as a surrogate of safety) in an 
adolescent population as compared with adults after a single dose consisting of a total of four 
consecutive inhalations (total nominal dose: 400 mcg BDP, 24 mcg FF, and 50 mcg GB). 
Based on the results of this study, an active controlled safety and efficacy study in adolescents is 
planned to be conducted next by the applicant (study CLI-05993CB1-02).

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
In the PK study CLI-05993CB1-01, the commercially available pMDI formulation and strength of 
CHF 5993 approved adult patients with COPD and asthma (dose strength 100/6/12.5 mcg, referred to 
as medium strength) was used. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In the framework of this submission, the MAH submitted the final clinical study report (CSR) for: 
• 
study CLI-05993CB1-01 
Study title: A single-dose, uncontrolled, open label, non-randomised, clinical pharmacology 
study of CHF 5993 100/6/12.5 μg pMDI (fixed combination of beclometasone dipropionate plus 
formoterol fumarate plus glycopyrronium bromide) in asthmatic adolescent patients and adult 
patients 
LPLV of the study was on 04FEB2021 and the report issued on 23JUL2021. The CSR is thus 
submitted within six (6) months from study completion as required by applicable regulation. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study CLI-05993CB1-01 
Description 
This was a single-dose, uncontrolled, open-label, non-randomised study to characterise the pharmaco-
kinetics, safety and tolerability of CHF 5993 100/6/12.5 mcg pMDI in asthmatic adolescent patients as 
compared to adults. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objectives 
-to evaluate the total systemic exposure to the active ingredients of CHF 5993 (B17MP, formoterol and 
GB) as measured by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to the last 
quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t) after inhalation of CHF 5993 pMDI in adolescent asthmatic patients 
in comparison to adult asthmatic patients; 
-to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BDP and additional PK parameters of B17MP, 
formoterol, and GB; 
-to evaluate the systemic effects in terms of heart rate (HR), serum potassium and glucose levels and 
the general safety and tolerability profile of CHF 5993 pMDI in adolescent asthmatics as compared with 
adult asthma patients. 
Study design 
An overview on the study design is provided in Figure 1. Patients who met the eligibility criteria upon the 
screening were enrolled into the study. Patients presented to the clinical unit on the morning of day D1 with 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

no prior in-house stay. Once the eligibility was re-confirmed and the pre-dose assessments completed, 
study participants administered a single dose of CHF 5993 and remained in-house until the 10-hour post-
dose assessments had been completed. On day D2 of the study, study participants came back to the clinical 
unit for further post-dose assessments. Fourteen (14) to sixteen (16) days after IMP administration, an 
end-of-study visit took place.

Study design and visits 
GCP aspects 
The applicant confirms that the study was conducted in compliance with ICH-GCP and other applicable 
international regulations and guidance. According to the documentation submitted by the applicant, 
maintenance audits of the service providers entrusted with on-site monitoring, PK/PD-analyses, data 
management biostatistics, medical writing and cardiac safety analyses were performed. 
Laboratory analyses were carried out according to GCP and the applicable principles of Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD. 
No major deviations from the CTP were reported by study sponsor. 
Study population /Sample size 
The study population included male and female adolescent and adult patients with a diagnosis of asthma for 
at least 6 months prior to the screening visit. Participants had to be on regular treatment with medium 
doses of ICS alone or in fixed combination with long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) and using short-acting β2-
agonist (SABA) as reliever. In line with the GINA 2019 guideline, asthma disease had to be controlled in 
order to be able to wash out BDP and other corticosteroids two days before the IMP was administered. In 
order to be eligible, participants had to have a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of >70% of 
predicted values after withholding treatment for a minimum of 6h prior to screening or 24h in case of LABA. 
Further criteria were consistent with accepted standards for this type of clinical research involving an 
asthma population. 
The required sample size was calculated to be N=74 evaluable patients (assumed standard deviation of 
0.38 on a log-scale; 80% power to rule out that the ratio in total systemic exposure between adolescents 
and adults is greater than 125%; two-sided 90% confidence interval). Considering a rate of non-evaluable 
participants of approx. 7%, a total of 80 patients (40 adolescents and 40 adults) were planned to be 
enrolled.  
All 40 eligible subjects (100%) enrolled in the two age groups were treated with the IMP and also 
completed the PK part of the study. The PD analysis set consisted of N=75 patients (N=38 adolescents 
and N=37 adults). 
Treatments 
Prior to IMP administration, all participants were instructed and received documented training to 
correctly use the pMDI device using an aerosol inhalation monitor (AIMTM Vitalograph).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/38576/2022

On day D1, all participants administered one single dose of CHF 5993 from one inhaler, consisting of 
four consecutive inhalations of CHF 5993 100/6/12.5 µg pMDI (total nominal dose: 400 mcg BDP, 
24 mcg FF and 50 mcg GB). 
Patients were instructed to hold their breath for 10 seconds following each inhalation and to wait 
approximately 30 seconds before administering the next inhalation. This resulted in an interval of 
40 seconds between consecutive inhalations. Time zero was defined as the time when the first 
inhalation was initiated and thus, all post-dose measurement times of PK and PD parameters refer to 
this time point. 
Any issues observed by the investigator(s) or their designee(s) during the inhalation manoeuvres were 
recorded in the eCRF. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
A total of nine blood samples collected up to 10 hours post-dose (pre, 5’, 15’, 30’, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h and 10h 
post-dose) to quantify the concentrations of BDP, B17-MP formoterol and GB (pharmacokinetic part).  
•  primary variables 
AUC0-t of B17MP, formoterol and GB; 
•  secondary variables 
Cmax, tmax, AUC0-0.5h, AUC0-∞ and t½ of B17MP, formoterol and GB; 
AUC0-t, Cmax and tmax of BDP. 
The following pharmacodynamic parameters were recorded: 
•  serum potassium: AUC0-2h, AUC0-t  , Cmin, tmin; 
•  serum glucose: AUC0-2h, AUC0-t  , Cmax, tmax; 
•  heart rate (HR): average pre-dose, 0-4h, 0-12h and 0-24h; 
•  12-lead ECG parameters extracted from Holter: HR, PR, QRS and QTcF; 
•  blood pressure: systolic and diastolic blood pressure. 
Safety variables: 
•  number of AEs recorded throughout the duration of the study; 
•  number and percentage of patients who experienced at least one AE; 
• 
clinical laboratory test results (chemistry, hematology and urinalysis). 
Statistical Methods 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) was finalised on 14 April 2021 and thus prior to database lock (06 
May 2021). Calculations of PK and PD (potassium and glucose) parameters was performed using 
WinNonlin Phoenix 8.0. All statistical calculations were performed using SAS software version 9.4. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses: The PK analysis set was used for all PK analyses; no patients were excluded 
from this analysis set. PK analyses were based on actual times. PK parameters were calculated, where 
data permitted, by standard non-compartmental methods. Cmax and tmax were obtained directly from 
the experimental data without interpolation. 
AUC0-t of B17MP, formoterol and GB was log-transformed and analysed using a linear model including 
patient group (adolescent or adult) as fixed effects. The ratios of adjusted geo means between patient 
groups (adolescent vs. adult) were calculated with their 90% two-sided CIs. Adolescent and adult total 
systemic exposure was assessed as comparable if the upper limit of CIs of the ratios (adolescent vs. 
adult) was lower or equal to 125. Forest plots of the GMR including the respective 90% CIs were to be

graphically presented for the inferential statistical comparison (adolescents vs adults) of AUC0-t, 
AUC0-0.5h and Cmax of B17MP, formoterol and GB, respectively. 
Pharmacodynamic analyses: 
Serum potassium and serum glucose concentrations / time curves were descriptively analysed and 
graphically displayed (by age group) in linear/linear scale. 
Parameters of BP and ECG parameters extracted from Holter (HR, PR, QRS, and QTcF; HR0-4h, 
HR0-12h, and HR0-24h) were also descriptively analysed by age category. Actual values and changes 
from baseline (incl. corresponding 95% CI) were tabulated separately. For QTcF, the number and 
percentage of patients with abnormal actual values and/or abnormal changes from baseline were 
calculated. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The study was conducted at 2 clinical sites in Poland from 27FEB2020 (first patient first visit, FPFV) 
until 04FEB2021 (last patient last visit, LPLV). 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the enrolment was stopped and/or trial conduct suspended 
repeatedly. Risk assessment documents were released by the sites to ensure that relevant precautions 
were taken to guarantee the safety of study participants, their relatives and of site staff. On-site 
monitoring visits were suspended during the first phase of the pandemic outbreak until June 2020 but 
are reported to have resumed at times in a limited form from July 2020 onwards. According to the 
applicant, restrictions and precautions slowed down the Source Data Verification (SDV) activities but 
did not prevent a full check of the study data. To achieve this objective, remote monitoring was 
allowed. 
In total, 41 adolescent patients and 41 adult patients were screened of whom N=1 (2.4%) adolescent 
patient and N=1 (2.4%) adult patient were classified to be screening failures. Thus, N=40 adolescent 
patients and N=40 adult patients were enrolled, received the dose of IMP as defined in the CTP and 
completed the study. The three analysis sets of study CLI-05993CB1-01 are presented in Table 1. 
Table 1: 
Analysis sets of study CLI-05993CB1-01 
The PK analysis set was defined as all patients of the safety set excluding those without any valid PK 
measurement and with major protocol deviations affecting PK evaluations. In reality, the PK population 
consisted of less than N=40 participants for the three analytes in both age groups because a number 
of instances were observed, leading to the exclusion of data from analyses or rendering data unreliable 
(in the assessment of the study sponsor). The detailed reasons on which the sponsor's decision was 
based, are not clearly presented and therefore difficult to understand, at least in part. The document 
relevant to probably understand in a more straightforward way the decisions taken by the study 
sponsor in relation with protocol deviations and the exclusion of participants and/or individual results 
from certain analyses was not submitted (so-called Data Review Report, DRR).

In the following, a brief overview on the most important issues is provided in the following 
(Table 2, Table 3). 
Quantifiable pre-dose concentrations (>5% of individual Cmax) were reported in this PK study for 
the following analytes and subjects. Respective data were excluded not only from the statistical PK 
analyses for the analyte concerned, but also all PD assessments.

Baseline data 
The gender distribution between the age groups was uneven: whereas 62.5% of the adolescents 
population were male, this percentage was only 35.0% in the adult age group. The mean (min-max) 
age was 14.8 (12-17) years for adolescents and 43.6 (19-64) years for adults. Their mean (SD) BMI 
was 22.3 (3.7) kg/m2 and 25.35 (3.0) kg/m2, respectively. All patients in both age categories were 
white and – as per inclusion criteria - non-smokers. 
At study entry, the vast majority of patients in the adolescent and adult group was on a fixed combina-
tion ICS / LABA treatment regimen (77.5% and 92.5%, respectively). Mean (SD) screening FEV1 value 
was 3.512 (0.772) L for adolescent patients versus 2.636 (0.813) L for adult patients, corresponding to 
101.39% (range: 74-144) vs 83.47% (range:71-112) of the predicted normal value. A small 
percentage of patients in both groups reported to have experienced at least one asthma exacerbation 
in the previous 12 months (10.0% vs 12.5%). 
Efficacy results 
•  Pharmacokinetics

Comparative pharmacokinetics in adolescents and adult asthma patients after administration of a 
single, supratherapeutic dose of CHF 5993 (twice the approved adult clinical dose; nominal dose 
BDP/FF/GB of 400/24/50 mcg) were studied up to 10h post-dose for the metabolite B17-MP, 
formoterol and GB. Due to the inadequate sampling schedule for the parent compound BDP, these 
results have only limited relevance to the research question of this study. 
The total systemic bioavailability (AUC0-t) as assessed in this study is reflecting the pulmonary 
disposition as well as the gastrointestinal absorption of swallowed active ingredients, and thus is a 
surrogate of the orally inhaled medicinal product’s safety.  
In adolescents, AUC0-t was (markedly) lower for all three primary analytes (B17-MP, formoterol, 
GB) when compared with adult plasma levels. Similarly, peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of all 
three analytes were (markedly) lower in adolescents. Overall, the elimination half-live t1/2 was 
shorter for the adolescents as compared to the adult levels (Table 4, Figure 2).  
The median time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) was comparable between the age groups, 
though it needs to be mentioned that the early sampling frequency of blood samples (5’, 15’ and 
30’ post-dose) was not adapted to the rapid pulmonary disposition of FF and GB. This is even 
more true for the parent compound BDP where plasma levels were only quantifiable upon three 
measurement times, i.e. 5’, 15’ and 30’ post-dose. Results for these three measurement times – 
with all necessary reservations – may point towards a lower pulmonary disposition in adolescent 
patients as compared with adults (point estimator of AUC0-0.5h 3.4 (90%CI [24.4-51.2]).

Figure 2: 
AUC0-t and Cmax for each of the three main analytes in adolescents 
versus adults – Forest plot (PK analysis set) 
Thus, the primary objective of the study to rule out a higher systemic plasma exposure (in terms 
of AUC0-t) to B17MP, formoterol and GB, if the medium dose strength of CHF5993 approved in an 
adult asthma population is administered in adolescents, was achieved. The upper limit of the 
respective 90%CI remained below the threshold of 125% for all three analytes. 
More detailed results are displayed for each of the three analytes in turn in Figure 3 to Figure 5 as 
well as in Table 5 to Table 11. It is noted that – based on source data - the PK parameter 
AUC0-0.05h included the tables of the CSR most likely is a typo and should read truncated 
AUC0-0.5h.

•  Pharmacokinetics – BDP 
Table 11: 
BDP – inferential statistical analysis results (PK analysis set) 
In view of the purely safety-oriented study objective and the participation of an adolescent 
population, it appears acceptable that the blood sampling schedule was not adapted to adequately 
quantify the kinetics of the rapidly absorbed (tmax <5’) and short-lived parent compound BDP 
which in adition is known to undergo extensive first-pass metabolism. 
As stated in the Q&A document of the PKWP dated 03/2020 (item 4.11), truncated AUC0-30min of 
BDP without charcoal block is however considered a more sensitive measure of pulmonary 
deposition than AUC0-30min of B17MP, and thus efficacy. Though available BDP data need to be 
interpreted with caution (as based mainly on three sampling times only), they together with 
B17MP data may point towards a relevantly lower pulmonary deposition of ICS from the 
formulation in an adolescent population. The width of the 90%CI appears does not appear to be 
excessively wide. 
•  Pharmacodynamic parameters 
As mentioned above, the PD analysis set consisted of N=75 patients. Two adolescent patients and 
three adult patients were excluded from the PK analysis due to quantifiable pre-dose 
concentrations of formoterol (5.7% to 15.7% of individual Cmax during PK profiling). Reference is 
made to the section «Results - Recruitment/ Number analysed» of this report. 
Hypokalaemia is known to be potentially associated with beta-agonist treatment. Results of this 
study are difficult to interpret due to the important number of haemolytic samples, especially in 
the adolescent group. Available serum glucose results point towards the fact that formoterol at the 
supratherapeutic dose administered led to an increase in blood glucose which in two adolescents 
exceeded the normal range. 
Overall, there were no relevant trends over time or between groups in terms of the various 
cardiovascular parameters assessed.

Multiple blood samples were haemolysed, thereby relevantly affecting the analysis of potassium 
serum concentrations. As can be seen from Table 14.2.3.2, this problem predominantly affected 
the adolescent age group.  
The sponsor has therefore defined a set of post-study criteria to determine which single and/or 
patient potassium results are included in the descriptive statistical analysis and which are 
excluded. As this approach is considered arbitrary, the conclusions regarding potassium serum

levels and profile of adolescent patients are not considered conclusive by the clinical assessor and 
therefore not presented in detail in the core of this assessment report. For details, reference is 
made to chapters 11.6.1 and 11.6.2.1 of the CSR. 
•  Pharmacodynamics – Glucose 
The pharmacodynamics of glucose were studied in serum up to 4h post-dose. It is noted that 
patients were fasting up to approximately 2h post-dose when a standardises meal was served to 
all participants. This is most likely the reason for the increase in glucose serum concentrations 
between the 2h and 4h post-dose measurement time when the glucose result exceeded the upper 
reference range of 5.9 mmol/L in many participants. 
In two adolescents hyperglycaemia was reported prior to food intake already (Table 12). In the 
immediate post-dosing period, a total of N=6 adult patients of the PD population presented 
hyperglycaemia, which was however already present upon the pre-dose measurement. Only two 
adults with pre-dose serum glucose in the normal range showed an increase exceeding the normal 
range in the post-dose period and prior to food intake.

•  Pharmacodynamics – parameters based on 24h Holter recordings 
In both age groups, mean HR increased from 4h until 12h post-dose, the mean maximum change 
from baseline being +15 bpm at 10h post-dose for adolescents +8.3 bpm at 4h post-dose for 
adults (Figure 6).  
After discharge from the clinical unit (at 16h and 20h post-dose), the mean HR decreased to 
below baseline values in both age groups to re-increase on the next morning. 
In addition, heart rate averages were calculated from Holter recordings for three sampling 
intervals (HR0-4h, HR0-12h and HR0-24h). 
Overall, the HR profiles presented no relevant differences between the two age groups. 
Similarly, QTcF and the respective change from baseline was comparable in adolescents and 
adults with no obvious between-group differences (Figure 7). Individual increases from baseline in 
QTcF of >30ms were observed in N=4 (10.8%) adolescents and N=12 (36.4%) adults, but none 
of these resulted in a QTcF of >450ms (males) or >470ms (females).

Safety results 
Overall, no relevant or new safety signals were identified in the adolescent and adult patients enrolled 
in this clinical study and administered a single supratherapeutic dose of CHF5993 (nominal dose 
400 mcg BDP, 24 mcg FF, and 50 mcg GB). 
•  Treatment-emergent adverse events 
Analyses of safety parameters were based on the safety dataset, defined as all patients who were 
enrolled and received at least one dose of the investigational medicinal product (CHF5993). 
No deaths, other SAEs, or COVID-19-related TEAEs were reported during this study. Overall, a low 
number of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were reported. N=3 (3.8%) of adult participants and none 
of the adolescents reported to have experienced a TEAE. All four (4) TEAEs reported in the 3 adult 
patients were mild in intensity, required no treatment, resolved before trial end, and were considered 
to be treatment related (Table 13).

•  Physical examination and clinical safety laboratory results 
Results of physical examinations or clinical safety laboratory were not suggestive of any relevant safety 
related to the administration of the single supratherapeutic dose of CHF5993.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Clinical study CLI-05993CB1-01 is an uncontrolled, open-label, non-randomised clinical pharmacology 
study comparing the effects of administering a single supratherapeutic dose of medium strength 
CHF5993 (CHF5993 100/6/12.5 mcg; N=4 consecutive inhalations, resulting in a nominal dose of 
400 mcg BDP, 24 mcg FF, and 50 mcg GB) in adolescent (12 to 17 years of age) and adult asthma 
patients. 
The primary objective of the trial was to quantify the total systemic exposure (AUC0-t) to each of the 
three active ingredients of CHF 5993 as a surrogate of safety. Thereby, confirmation was sought that 
the use of the commercially available formulation and medium dose strength of CHF 5993 (which so far 
is approved in adult patients with asthma only) is safe and does not result in an undesirably high 
exposure to one or more of the active ingredients (BDP, formoterol, GB) in an adolescent asthma 
population as compared with adult controls. 
This objective was achieved. Available data suggest that Cmax as well as AUC0-t of all three analytes 
remained clearly below the pre-defined limit of 125%, when comparing adolescent and adult exposures 
after a single dose of CHF5993. 
Results of pharmacodynamic parameters appear to confirm this conclusion as no relevant between-
group differences or trends over the observation period of the study were reported. It is mentioned in 
the core of this report, that an inappropriate blood sampling technique (leading to haemolysis of 
multiple samples) relevantly limits the interpretability of the potassium results, in particular in the 
adolescent population. 
Based on TEAE data, overall, administration of a single dose of medium strength CHF5993 was safe 
and well tolerated in both age groups. 
Therefore, the applicant is planning now to proceed to the 2nd adolescent study defined in the PIP, i.e. 
study CLI-05993CB1-02  
Until further study results are available, the applicant is of the opinion that the currently authorised 
summary of product characteristics (SmPC) does not need to be updated, since the efficacy of 
CHF5993 pMDI in adolescents with asthma has not yet been established. This can be agreed to. 
It is agreed that the PK study under assessment focussed on safety aspects (i.e. total systemic 
exposure) and that in view of this objective, the start and frequency of sampling were not adapted to 
reliably assess the early disposition phase and measure truncated AUC (AUC0-0.5h) as a measure 
of pulmonary deposition. 
However, with all necessary caveats and limitations, the data generated suggest that pulmonary 
deposition as roughly estimated from AUC0-0.5h was lower in adolescent asthmatics compared with 
adults for all three active ingredients (point estimator [90%CI]: B17MP1 86.7 [69.9;107.7]; formoterol 
77.9 [62.4;97.2]; GB 74.3 [58.4;94.4]). This is further confirmed by AUC0-t data of the rapidly 
absorbed and short-lived parent compound of the ICS component BDP ([35.4 [24.4;51.2]). 
This observation is unexpected since adolescents and adults are considered to have a similar airway 
geometry and range of breathing patters and tidal volumes. There is however a precedent in this 
respect. 
1   gastrointestinal absorption of swallowed B17MP not negligible and thus also contributing to AUC0-0.5h (in contrast to 
the parent compound BDP)

Early absorption of the ICS component (but not formoterol) from the applicant’s related, fixed-dose 
dual combination product (CHF1535 BDP/FF 100/6 mcg pMDI) was previously reported to be 
lower in adolescent asthma patients as compared with adults (PK study CP08; procedure reference 
DE/H/0871/001/II/079). In the corresponding pivotal, 12-week superiority study in adolescent asthma 
patients (CT05), CHF1535 100/6 mcg pMDI was found not to be superior to BDP monotherapy, neither 
in terms of pulmonary function parameters (primary variable: change from baseline in pre-dose 
morning PEF), secondary efficacy variables, nor clinical outcome measures. Consequently, this pMDI 
medicinal product is still not indicated in adolescents. 
This and the above tentative PK findings raise a concern and should be taken into account when 
evaluating whether the PIP development programme is still appropriate and when assessing the 
usefulness of the therapeutic equivalence (TE) study which is planned next under the PIP in 
adolescents asthma patients (study 2, CLI-05995CB1-02). 
There appears to be a risk that the planned clinical study will not be suitable to detect differences in 
pulmonary deposition of the individual components between adolescents and adults (if they do exist), 
because other than dedicated PK studies, such TE studies are known to have notoriously low 
discriminatory power, even if correctly designed and powered. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Results  of  clinical  study  CLI-05993CB1-01  suggest  that  administration  of  a  single,  supratherapeutic 
dose  of  medium  strength  CHF 5993  100/6/12.5 mcg  (N=4  consecutive  inhalations,  resulting  in  a 
nominal dose of 400 mcg BDP, 24 mcg FF, and 50 mcg GB) to adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) is 
safe and well tolerated. Total systemic exposure (AUC0-t) to each of the three active ingredients as a 
surrogate  of  safety  was  lower  in  adolescents  as  compared  with  adults  (upper  90%CI  <125%). 
Recorded pharmacodynamic parameters overall endorsed this conclusion. 
Thus, the primary objective of clinical study focussing on this safety aspect was achieved. 
The  applicant’s  conclusion  that  the  currently  authorised  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC) 
does not need to be updated is agreed. 
However,  preliminary  data  collected  in  the  PK  part  of  this  clinical  trial  suggest  that  the  pulmonary 
deposition  of  all  three  active  ingredients  of  CHF5993  and  especially  of  the  ICS  component  may  be 
lower in adolescents than in adults, with unclear consequences for the product’s efficacy in adolescents 
as  compared  with  adults.  The  question  arises  whether  the  design  and  objective  of  the  therapeutic 
equivalence  study  planned  under  the  PIP  (CLI-05995CB1-02),  comparing  the  fixed-dose  triple 
combination  product  (BDP/FF/GB)  with  a  free  dual  combination  (BDP/FF)  in  male  and  female 
adolescent  asthma  patients,  are  suitable  to  clarify  this  issue.  The  MAH  is  recommended  to  seek 
scientific advice with PDCO involvement on this matter.

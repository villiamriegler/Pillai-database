PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Axumin 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Axumin. The RMP details important 
risks of Axumin, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Axumin’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Axumin’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet  give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Axumin should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Axumin should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Axumin’s 
RMP. 
6.1.1 
The Medicine and what it is Used for 
Axumin is authorised for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging to detect recurrence 
of prostate cancer in adult men with a suspected recurrence based on elevated blood prostate 
specific  antigen  (PSA)  levels  after  primary  curative  treatment  (see  SmPC  for  the  full 
indication). It contains fluciclovine (18F) as the active substance and it is given by intravenous 
injection.  
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Axumin’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Axumin’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA)

Risks  Associated  with  the  Medicine  and  Activities  to  Minimise  or  Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Axumin, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Axumin’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to minimise 
the risk that the medicine is used incorrectly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Axumin,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment, so that 
immediate  action  can  be

taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Axumin is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
6.1.2.1 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important  risks  of  Axumin  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Axumin. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine); 
Important identified and potential risks, together with missing information, are summarised in 
Table 22.

Risk Factors and Risk Groups 
Not applicable – there do not appear to be any patient-related risk

Risk Minimisation Measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
•  Listed as an ADR in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
•  Section 4.2 of the SmPC provides information on the correct 
method of administration.

Risk Factors and Risk Groups 
Risk Minimisation Measures 
There are no patient-specific risk groups or risk factors, but lack of 
familiarity or of complete training by image interpreters may be a 
risk factor for misinterpretation of imaging results. For example, 
normal biodistribution of fluciclovine (18F) can result in uptake into 
muscle and the pancreas may be misinterpreted as an abnormal 
finding.  
Additionally, sub-optimal PSA levels may lead to false negative 
findings as the optimal performance of Axumin is linked to a PSA 
level of 1.05 ng/mL. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
• 
•  Section 4.2 of the SmPC provides information on the correct

Additional risk minimisation measures: 
Provision of a self-training programme containing the following 
information: 
•  Physiological distribution of fluciclovine. 
• 
•  Examples of incidental findings on PET-CT with fluciclovine. 
•  Examples of positive and negative findings on PET-CT with

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This  centralised  application  concerns  a  hybrid  application  according  to  article  10(3)  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC  for  Zolsketil  pegylated  liposomal  2  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  dispersion,  which 
contains  doxorubicin  hydrochloride  as  active  substance.  The  reference  medicinal  product  in  this 
application is Adriamycin 2 mg/ml solution for injection (authorised nationally in Denmark on October 
24th 1979).  
Adriamycin and Zolsketil pegylated liposomal differ in terms of formulation, since Adriamycin contains 
doxorubicin  hydrochloride  in  a  non-liposomal  formulation  while  Zolsketil  pegylated  liposomal  contains 
doxorubicin  hydrochloride  in  a  pegylated  liposomal  formulation.  Hence,  due  to  the  differences  in 
formulation,  a  bioequivalence  study  was  not  feasible.  Therefore,  Caelyx,  which  contains  doxorubicin 
hydrochloride in a pegylated liposomal formulation was chosen as comparator with regards to quality, 
non-clinical  and  clinical  comparability.  Caelyx  2  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  was 
authorised in the European Union on 20 June 1996 through a centralised procedure. 
The indications applied for Zolsketil pegylated liposomal are the same indications authorised for Caelyx: 
- 
- 
- 
As monotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer, where there is an increased cardiac 
risk. 
For treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in women who have failed a first-line platinum-based 
chemotherapy regimen. 
In combination with Bortezomib for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients 
who have received at least one prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable 
for bone marrow transplant. 
For treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in patients with low CD4 counts (< 200 CD4 
lymphocytes/mm3) and extensive mucocutaneous or visceral disease. 
Doxorubicin hydrochloride is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic obtained from Streptomyces peucetius 
var. Caseins. The exact mechanism of the antitumour activity of doxorubicin is not known. It is generally 
believed that inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis is responsible for the majority of the cytotoxic 
effects. This is probably the result of intercalation of the anthracycline between adjacent base pairs of 
the DNA double helix thus preventing their unwinding for replication. 
Liposomes are microscopic vesicles composed of a phospholipid bilayer that are capable of encapsulating 
active  drugs.  The  liposomes  of  Doxorubicin  are  formulated  with  surface-bound  methoxy  polyethylene 
glycol  (MPEG),  a  process  often  referred  to  as  pegylation,  to  protect  liposomes  from  detection  by  the 
mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and to increase blood circulation time. 
Pegylated liposomes have a half-life of approximately 55 hours in humans. They are stable in blood, and 
direct measurement of liposomal Doxorubicin shows that at least 90% of the drug (the assay used cannot 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/212114/2022  
Page 10/46 
 
 
 
 
quantify  less  than  5-10%  unencapsulated  Doxorubicin)  remains  liposome  encapsulated  during 
circulation. 
It is hypothesized that because of their small size (ca. 100 nm) and persistence in the circulation, the 
pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride liposomes are able to penetrate the altered and often compromised 
vasculature of tumors. This hypothesis is supported by studies using colloidal gold containing pegylated 
liposomes, which can be visualized microscopically. Evidence of penetration of pegylated liposomes from 
blood  vessels  and  their  entry  and  accumulation  in  tumors  has  been  seen  in  mice  with  C-26  colon 
carcinoma  tumors  and  in  transgenic  mice  with  Kaposi's  sarcoma-like  lesions.  Once  the  pegylated 
liposomes  distribute  to  the  tissue  compartment,  the  encapsulated  doxorubicin  hydrochloride  becomes 
available. The exact mechanism of release is not understood. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal) concentrate for solution for infusion is a long-
circulating pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin hydrochloride. Pegylated liposomes contain 
surface-grafted segments of the hydrophilic polymer methoxy polyethylene glycol (MPEG). These linear 
MPEG groups extend from the liposome surface creating a protective coating that reduces interactions 
between the lipid bilayer membrane and the plasma components. This allows the Doxorubicin 
Hydrochloride Liposomes (Pegylated Liposomal) to circulate for prolonged periods in the blood stream. 
Pegylated liposomes are small enough (average diameter of approximately 100 nm) to pass intact 
(extravasate) through defective blood vessels supplying tumours. The pegylated liposomes also have a 
low permeability lipid matrix and internal aqueous buffer system to keep Doxorubicin hydrochloride 
encapsulated during liposome residence time in circulation. 
The  plasma  pharmacokinetics  of  Doxorubicin  Hydrochloride  (Pegylated  Liposomal)  concentrate  for 
solution  for  infusion  in  humans  differs  significantly  from  those  reported  in  the  literature  for  standard 
doxorubicin  hydrochloride  preparations.  Standard  Doxorubicin  hydrochloride  displays  extensive  tissue 
distribution  (volume  of  distribution:  700  to  1,100  l/m2)  and  a  rapid  elimination  clearance  (24  to  73 
l/h/m2).  In  contrast,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  Doxorubicin  Hydrochloride  (Pegylated  Liposomal) 
concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  indicates  that  Doxorubicin  Hydrochloride  (Pegylated  Liposomal) 
concentrate for solution for infusion is confined mostly to the vascular fluid volume and that the clearance 
of doxorubicin from the blood is dependent upon the liposomal carrier. Doxorubicin becomes available 
after the liposomes are extravasated and enter the tissue compartment. 
At equivalent doses, the plasma concentration and AUC values of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Pegylated 
Liposomal) concentrate for solution for infusion which represent mostly pegylated liposomal Doxorubicin 
hydrochloride (containing 90 % to 95 % of the measured Doxorubicin) are significantly higher than those 
achieved with standard Doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations. 
Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal) concentrate for solution for infusion should not be used 
interchangeably with other formulations of Doxorubicin hydrochloride. 
Patients with impaired hepatic function 
Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal) concentrate for solution for infusion pharmacokinetics 
determined in a small number of patients with elevated total bilirubin levels do not differ from patients 
with normal total bilirubin; however, until further experience is gained, the Doxorubicin Hydrochloride 
(Pegylated  Liposomal)  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  dosage  in  patients  with  impaired  hepatic 
function should be reduced based on the experience from the breast and ovarian clinical trial programs 
as follows: at initiation of therapy, if the bilirubin is between 1.2-3.0 mg/dl, the first dose is reduced by 
25%. If the bilirubin is > 3.0 mg/dl, the first dose is reduced by 50%. If the patient tolerates the first 
dose without an increase in serum bilirubin or liver enzymes, the dose for cycle 2 can be increased to 
the next dose level, i.e., if reduced by 25% for the first dose, increase to full dose for cycle 2; if reduced 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/212114/2022  
Page 11/46 
 
 
 
by 50% for the first dose, increase to 75% of full dose for cycle 2. The dosage can be increased to full 
dose for subsequent cycles if tolerated. 
Doxorubicin  Hydrochloride  (Pegylated  Liposomal)  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  can  be 
administered to patients with liver metastases with concurrent elevation of bilirubin and liver enzymes 
up to 4 x the upper limit of the normal range. Prior to Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal) 
concentrate for solution for infusion administration, evaluate hepatic function using conventional clinical 
laboratory tests such as ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. 
Patients with impaired renal function 
As doxorubicin is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the bile, dose modification should not be 
required. Population pharmacokinetic data (in the range of creatinine clearance tested of 30-156 
ml/min) demonstrate that Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal) concentrate for solution 
for infusion clearance is not influenced by renal function. No pharmacokinetic data are available in 
patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 ml/min. 
Population pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal) concentrate for solution for 
infusion was evaluated in 120 patients from 10 different clinical trials using the population 
pharmacokinetic approach. The mean intrinsic clearance of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Pegylated 
Liposomal) concentrate for solution for infusion was 0.030 l/h/m2 (range 0.008 to 0.152 l/h/m2) and 
the mean central volume of distribution was 1.93 l/m2 (range 0.96 – 3.85 l/m2) approximating the 
plasma volume. The apparent half-life ranged from 24 – 231 hrs with a mean of 73.9 hrs. 
Breast cancer patients 
The pharmacokinetics of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal) concentrate for solution for 
infusion  determined  in  18  patients  with  breast  carcinoma  were  similar  to  the  pharmacokinetics 
determined in the larger population of 120 patients with various cancers. The mean intrinsic clearance 
was 0.016 l/h/m2 (range 0.008 - 0.027 l/h/m2), the mean central volume of distribution was 1.46 l/m2 
(range 1.10 - 1.64 l/m2). The mean apparent half-life was 71.5 hrs (range 45.2 - 98.5 hrs). 
Ovarian cancer patients 
The pharmacokinetics of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal) concentrate for solution for 
infusion  determined  in  11  patients  with  ovarian  carcinoma  were  similar  to  the  pharmacokinetics 
determined in the larger population of 120 patients with various cancers. The mean intrinsic clearance 
was 0.021 l/h/m2 (range 0.009 – 0.041 l/h/m2), the mean central volume of distribution was 1.95 l/m2 
(range 1.67 – 2.40 l/m2). The mean apparent half-life was 75.0 hrs (range 36.1 – 125 hrs).

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  a  concentrate  for  dispersion  for  infusion.  It  consists  of  a  pegylated  liposomal 
formulation of doxorubicin hydrochloride 2 mg/mL. Two fill volumes are proposed: 10 mL and 25 mL.

The  excipients  used 
in 
the 
formulation  are  hydrogenated  soy  phosphatidylcholine,  N-
(carbonylmethoxypoly-ethylene  glycol-2000)-1,2-  distearoyl-  sn-glycero-  3-phosphoethanolamine,

sodium salt (MPEG 2000-DSPE), cholesterol, ammonium sulfate, histidine, sucrose, ethanol anhydrous, 
hydrochloric acid, concentrated, sodium hydroxide, water for injection, and nitrogen gas. 
The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  formulate  a  robust  and  stable  product,  with 
essentially  similar  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  and  being  a  pharmaceutical  equivalent 
generic formulation of Caelyx® 2mg/ml (MA Holder: Janssen-Cilag International NV). 
The development of the formulation and manufacturing process has been described. The development 
of the formulation and manufacturing process was done using Quality by Design (QbD) approach. The 
quality  target  product  profile  (QTTP)  was  defined  based  on  the  European  reference  product;  Caelyx. 
Major  QTTP  elements  were  appearance/description,  route  of  administration,  dosage  form,  strength, 
therapeutic  indication,  pharmacokinetic  properties,  storage,  shelf  life,  packaging  and  drug  product 
quality. The critical quality attributes were identified for the drug substance and drug product. The CHMP 
raised a MO asking the applicant to determine the pH of the internal compartment of the liposomes, and 
liposomes  aggregation  in  5%  glucose.  This  was  addressed  and  the  MO  resolved,  concluding  that  the 
quality characterization of the product was performed in line with the CHMP reflection paper on the data 
requirements  for  intravenous  liposomal  products  developed  with  reference  to  an  innovator  liposomal 
product  (EMA/CHMP/806058/2009/Rev.  02).  The  comparison  for  the  test  and  reference  product  was 
performed for specification parameters. 
The identified CQAs of the active substance were description/appearance, assay, related substances, pH, 
bacterial endotoxins and microbial tests. 
The  identified  CQAs  of  the  finished  product  intermediate  (bulk  stage)  were  appearance,  pH,  assay, 
bioburden and weight per mL.  
The identified CQAs of the finished product were appearance, identification of doxorubicin, identification 
of  lipids,  pH,  osmolality,  particulate  matter,  particle  size  distribution,  zeta  potential,  assay,  related 
substances, lipid content, lipid degradants, encapsulation efficiency, free drug, drug to lipid ratio, sulfate 
and ammonium ion concentration, colour, sterility and bacterial endotoxin. 
The applicant determined the qualitative and quantitative composition of the reference product based on 
literature  survey,  SmPC/Labelling  and  analytical  evaluation  of  reference  product,  and  adopted  an 
equivalent composition for the formulation development of his product. The excipients selected are same 
as in the reference product. These are: 
•  Hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC). This is the main lipid component, which 
forms the lipid bilayer along with other lipids during the manufacturing of the liposome 
formulation. 
•  MPEG-DSPE. This is also a lipid component which forms the lipid bilayer along with other 
lipids  during  the  manufacturing  of  the  liposome  formulation  as  well  as  the  pegylated 
layer over the surface of the liposome. 
• 
• 
• 
cholesterol is the lipid component of the liposomes which provides the stability to the 
lipid bilayer of the liposomes. 
histidine which acts as a buffering agent. 
sucrose, used to maintain the isotonicity of the formulation. 
Assessment report

• 
• 
• 
• 
ammonium sulfate, used for the active substance precipitation and active drug loading 
in the liposomes. 
hydrochloric acid, to adjust the pH of the formulation. 
sodium hydroxide, to adjust the pH of the formulation 
ethanol, used for lipid solubilization 
•  water for injections, as the vehicle 
• 
nitrogen gas, as the inert gas used for sparging and flushing 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.Eur., 
US/NF  or  in-house  specifications.  As  requested  during  the  MA  evaluation,  the  applicant  presented  a 
detailed justification for the proposed specifications for the non-compendial excipients, discussing the 
relevance of the parameters included and their limits and justifying the omission of some tests. It was 
also confirmed that cholesterol complies with Ph. Eur. monograph 2397 on “cholesterol for parenteral 
use”. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
To  support  this  MAA,  the  applicant  conducted  an  extensive  comparative  characterisation  study  on 
multiple batches of the reference and the test product. The quality attributes evaluated as part of this 
comparability exercise were the same as those tested in the reference product, listed above. The original 
submission  included  only  tables  with  analytical  results,  and  was  missing  a  scientific  discussion  and  a 
statistical evaluation of the results, in line with the CHMP reflection paper on statistical methodology for 
the comparative assessment of quality attributes in drug development (EMA/CHMP/138502/2017). This 
was unacceptable and resulted in a major objection (MO) for which the applicant provided acceptable 
responses. 
In response, the applicant provided a statistical comparison protocol and report of CQAs in line with the 
CMHP  Reflection  paper.  According  to  the  information  provided,  for  each  set  quality  attributes  the 
similarity  criteria,  as  well  as  the  sample  strategy,  have  been  predefined  in  a  protocol.  Based  on  the 
analysed results the applicant confirmed that both products test and reference products are similar.  The 
analyses  provided  are  acceptable.  These  data  demonstrated  that  the  test  product  can  be  considered 
pharmaceutical equivalent to the reference product. 
The comparability results on the general physicochemical properties of the test product were found to 
be equivalent to Caelyx. There were no significant differences between both products.  
Upon request from the CHMP, and in line with the CHMP reflection paper on the data requirements for 
intravenous  liposomal  products  developed  with  reference  to  an  innovator  liposomal  product 
(EMA/CHMP/806058/2009/Rev.  02),  this  comparative  physicochemical  characterization  was  also 
conducted  on  samples  of  the  reference  and  test  products  stored  for  up  to  3  months  at  accelerated 
condition  (25°C/60%RH  in  inverted  vials  as  the  worst  case  condition).  Comparable  degradation 
behaviour was observed between the two products. 
In addition, the comparability exercise also included an evaluation of the phase transition temperature, 
the composition and morphology [lamellarity, shape of liposomes, location of drug substance, size 
distribution, drug encapsulation and grafted PEG layer thickness] of the liposomes, in vitro leakage on 
multiple conditions, determination of the internal pH of the liposomes and determination of aggregates. 
There results showed no notable differences between the applicant’s product and the reference product 
Caelyx.

Finally, in terms of drug release as measured by in vitro methods, both products were found to be 
equivalent in the various multiple conditions tested and the final in vitro release method proposed for 
quality control (QC) release testing. Comparability of the drug release profiles between the test and 
reference product under different conditions (e.g. temperature, pH) was also investigated. The results 
indicated that both products are highly comparable regardless of the in vitro release conditions.  
During initial assessment, the CHMP raised an MO on the choice of QC dissolution method and its 
discriminatory nature. In response, the choice of the QC method conditions and its discriminatory 
nature towards changes to product composition and manufacturing process parameters has been 
further discussed and found to be satisfactory. 
Overall, the applicant has discussed the physicochemical properties of the proposed product versus the 
reference product (Caelyx) in view of the required quality characterisation data as detailed in the CHMP 
reflection paper on the data requirements for intravenous liposomal products developed with reference 
to an innovator liposomal product (EMA/CHMP/806058/2009/Rev. 02). 
The liposomes are prepared using an ammonium sulfate gradient to load doxorubicin into the 
liposomes aqueous phase. Pre-formulation and development studies were described in sufficient detail. 
Based on the presented data, it is acceptable the use of overages proposed for the active substance 
and the lipids.  
The recommended hold time of 24 hours is acceptable for manufacturing / filtration / filling of doxorubicin 
hydrochloride pegylated liposomal 2 mg/mL concentrate for dispersion for infusion. The filter selection 
has been justified for the filtration of bulk solution. Further, four types of stoppers MOC were observed 
to  be  compatible  with  the  finished  product,  but  the  rubber  stopper  was  selected  as  similar  to  the 
innovator stopper MOC. The product is oxygen sensitive and should be stored under nitrogen headspace 
or atmosphere; the product is stable throughout the studied pH range. 
The manufacturing process includes sterile filtration and vial filling under aseptic conditions. As liposomes 
are temperature-sensitive, terminal sterilisation is not suitable for proposed finished product. The choice 
of the sterilisation method (sterile filtration) is justified. 
Process optimisation studies were conducted at laboratory and large batch sizes, with identification of 
scale dependent and independent process parameters. The process parameters considered of high risk 
were identified in the lipid extrusion and filtration steps. 
An  overage  of  doxorubicin  active  substance  to  compensate  for  manufacturing  process  loss  during 
filtration stage is justified by the results obtained during the validation of the manufacturing process. An 
excess lipid is employed to compensate for manufacturing losses observed during manufacturing of the 
lipid suspension prior to doxorubicin addition. 
The primary packaging material consists of Type I glass vials closed with a siliconised grey bromobutyl 
stopper, and an aluminium seal containing a deliverable volume of 10 mL (20 mg) or 25 mL (50 mg). 
The flip off seals for each fill volume are of different colour (blue for the 10 mL, red for the 25 mL). The 
glass container and rubber stoppers comply with the requirements of Ph. Eur. The finished product glass 
vial is further wrapped with PharmaShield®. PharmaShield® is a system consisting of a superficial plastic 
sheathing around the vial, going from the reinforced non-PVC base to the vial seal. 
The  container  closure  was  chosen  based  on  the  results  from  compatibility  studies  with  the  rubber 
stoppers and the glass vials, a 6-month stability study in inverted condition, a container closure integrity 
(CCI) study and an extractable and leachable study. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is concluded to be adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/212114/2022

Some  extractable  impurities  were  observed  at  different  concentrations;  the  impurities/extractables 
above AET level were considered as potential leachables and will be monitored during the leachable study 
in finished product (REC2).  
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of following main steps: preparation of buffer solution, preparation 
of  lipid  solution,  preparation  of  lipid  suspension  and  hydration,  extrusion,  diafiltration,  drug  solution 
preparation and loading, pre-filtration, aseptic filtration, filling and sealing. The CHMP raised a MO about 
the level of  detail  of  the manufacturing  process  description provided  in  the  original  submission  which 
was  insufficient.  This  was  addressed  satisfactorily  by  the  provision  of  further  details.  The  process  is 
considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The finished product is manufactured through a validated manufacturing process.  
Following a request from the CHMP, the applicant confirmed the maximum batch manufacturing time 
from the start of product manufacturing (doxorubicin addition) to the completion of packaging into the 
final primary container. 
The manufacturing process and in-process controls correspond to the actual standards of pharmaceutical 
technology for liposomal preparations and are suitable to guarantee an appropriate quality of the final 
finished  product.  Although  the  applicant  proposed  to  delete  the  IPC  for  “phosphorous  content”  for 
commercial production, a recommendation is made to keep this test in future process validation exercises 
(REC3). 
The  provided  validation  data  on  three  batches  of  each  fill  volume  (10  mL  &  25  mL)  show  a  good 
reproducibility with all presented data matching the specifications and in compliance with results obtained 
from  finished  product  release  testing.  These  imply  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  adequately 
controlled, reproducible and robust.  
2.2.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: description, identification for doxorubicin hydrochloride (HPLC), identification for lipids (HPLC for 
hydrogenated  soy  phosphatidylcholine,  HPLC  for  MPEG-DSPE,  HPLC  for  cholesterol),  pH,  extractable 
volume, uniformity of dosage units, degradation products (HPLC-UV), assay of doxorubicin hydrochloride 
(HPLC-UV/DAD),  in-vitro  release,  content  of  cholesterol  (HPLC-UV),  content  of  hydrogenated  soy 
phosphatidylcholine (HPLC-UV), content of MPEG-DSPE (HPLC-RI), lipid related impurities, encapsulation 
efficacy (HPLC-UV), free drug, drug to lipid ratio, histidine content (HPLC-UV), sucrose content (HPLC-
RI), sulfate ion concentration (IC), ammonium sulfate (IC), ammonium ion concentration (IC), ethanol 
content  (GC),  particle  size  distribution,  particulate  contamination,  sterility,  bacterial  endotoxins,  zeta 
potential,  phosphorous  content  (ICPS-OES),  osmolality  (Ph.Eur.),  turbidity  (Ph.Eur.),  and  colour  test 
(Ph.Eur.). 
Although some of the limits proposed by the applicant in the original submission were wider than the 
batch analysis data provided, following a MO raised by the CHMP, the applicant revised and tightened 
them. The revised release and shelf-life tests and limits are acceptable. Nonetheless, the applicant is 
recommended  to  continue  the  characterisation  studies  of  impurities  and  submit  the  data  as  soon  as 
available (REC4). The applicant is also recommended to revise the limit of impurity at RRT 0.95 to further 
guarantee that the limit is not exceeded during the shelf-life (REC5).

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. However, additional recommendations related to analytical 
methods (REC 6 and REC 7) are proposed to the applicant, as specified under the section 2.2.6.  
Batch analysis results on three production scale finished product batches of 10 mL and three batches of 
25 mL (i.e. the same batches as used in the stability studies) have been provided.  
Satisfactory details and certificates of analysis for standards used for the analysis of the finished product 
have been provided.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 
three process validation batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that 
each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Following a request from the CHMP (other concern) the applicant performed a risk assessment on the 
potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the product concluding that the presence of 
nitrosamines is negligible. The information on the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities was 
considered satisfactory. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of finished product of each presentation stored for up 
to  24  months  under  long  term  conditions  (5°C  ±  3°C)  and  for  up  to  six  months  under  accelerated 
conditions (25°C ± 2°C/60% ± 5%RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches were 
stored  in  inverted  position  in  clear  tubular  glass  vial  (type  I),  with  20  mm  grey  bromobutyl  rubber 
stopper,  and  a  coloured  flip  off  seal.  The  batches  of  Zolsketil  liposomal  pegylated  concentrate  for 
dispersion  for  infusion  used  in  the  stability  studies  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  pH,  related  substance,  assay  of  doxorubicin  hydrochloride, 
cholesterol 
content,  hydrogenated 
soy  phosphatidylcholine 
content,  MPEG-DSPE 
content, 
lysophophatidyl choline, lyso PEPEG 2000, free fatty acids, encapsulation efficiency, free drug, drug to 
lipid  ratio,  sulfate  ion  concentration,  ammonium  sulfate,  ammonium  ion  concentration,  particle  size, 
particle  size  distribution,  zeta  potential,  phosphorous  content,  osmolality,  particulate  contamination, 
sterility,  bacterial  endotoxins,  turbidity  and  colour  test.  The  analytical  procedures  used  have  been 
demonstrated to be stability indicating.  
At long term conditions, there was an increase in the level of related substances. No trends are observed 
in  the  assay  of  the  lipids,  or  in-vitro  release.  With  regards  to  the  lipid  related  impurities,  there  is  no 
change in the level of lysophosphatidyl choline. However, the levels of lyso PEPEG 2000 and free fatty 
acid increase over time.  There are no trends in any of the other parameters observed. 
To note, although at day 120 list of questions (LoQ) a MO was raised on the proposed shelf-life for the 
10 mL vials given that the observed level of the impurity at RRT 1.15 was not justified as being qualified, 
this was addressed by the applicant justifying the qualification level by use and the issue was resolved. 
At  accelerated  conditions,  out  of  specification  results  were  observed  for  related  substances,  in-vitro 
release, and MPEG-DSPE content.

A  forced  degradation  study  (covering  acid, base,  oxidative,  heat,  humidity,  photolytic  and  metal  ions 
degradation) was carried out as part of the analytical method validation in order to prove the specificity 
of the HPLC method for assay and related substances in the finished product, and therefore the stability 
indicating capability of those methods.  
In  addition,  one  batch  of  Zolsketil  pegylated  liposomal  concentrate  for  dispersion  for  infusion  was 
exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and 
Products.  Samples  were  tested  for:  description,  pH,  related  substance,  assay  of  doxorubicin 
hydrochloride, cholesterol content, hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine content, MPEG-DSPE content, 
lysophophatidyl choline, lyso PEPEG 2000, free fatty acids, encapsulation efficiency, free drug, drug to 
lipid ratio, particle size mean diameter and particle size distribution. The results demonstrate that the 
product is photostable. 
A freeze thaw study was conducted. The purpose was to generate data to support possible temperature 
excursions during transit. The results showed that the product physical and chemical parameters remain 
unaffected after three cycles of freeze thaw, concluding that there is no risk for short-term storage at 
freezing conditions. Nonetheless, the applicant proposed to maintain the stringent storage condition “do 
not  freeze”  in  line  with  reference  product.  The  inclusion  of  this  additional  condition  is  acceptable.  A 
dilution study was performed to evaluate the stability of doxorubicin hydrochloride pegylated liposomal 
2  mg/mL  concentrate  for  dispersion  for  infusion  after  dilution  with  5%  dextrose  solution  in  non  PVC 
infusion container for a period of 24 hrs at 2 - 8°C. The study is in accordance with the instructions in 
the  reference  product’s  SmPC.  One  test  batch  and  one  reference  batch  were  included  in  the  study. 
Samples were analysed for description, pH of diluted sample, assay of doxorubicin hydrochloride, related 
substances, particle size (mean), particle size distribution, encapsulation efficiency, free drug particulate 
matter  and  osmolality.  The  study  results  revealed  that  the  applicant’s  product  after  diluted  with  5% 
dextrose injection in the studies conditions meets the predetermined acceptance criteria for a period of 
24 hours at 2 - 8°C. The results on the test and reference products were comparable and support the 
administration instructions included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 18 months and storage conditions “Store 
in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C); do not freeze” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The  active  substance  of  the  product,  doxorubicin  hydrochloride,  is  subject  of  a  Ph.  Eur.  monograph 
(01/2008:0714). A CEP is used to support this application. 
The  finished  product  has  been  developed  in  essence  as  a  “generic”  of  Caelyx  (pegylated  liposomes 
containing doxorubicin) and has been compared with it. The comparison of physicochemical attributes 
has  been  conducted  in  line  with  the  CHMP  reflection  paper  on  the  data  requirements  for  intravenous 
liposomal 
products 
developed  with 
reference 
to 
an 
innovator 
liposomal 
product 
(EMA/CHMP/806058/2009/Rev.  02)  and  the  CHMP  reflection  paper  on  statistical  methodology  for  the 
comparative assessment of quality attributes in drug development (EMA/CHMP/138502/2017). Although 
five MO were raised during the evaluation, which pertained to comparability exercise (attributes included 
and statistical evaluation) of the test and reference products, quality characterisation of the product (e.g. 
pH of internal compartment of the liposomes, liposomes aggregation), level of detail of the manufacturing 
process  description,  description  of  the  dissolution  method,  finished  product  specification  and  the 
proposed shelf-life, all have been resolved by provision of the relevant additional information. 
There  are  a  few  recommendations  to  the  applicant  for  further  development  which  do  not  impact  the 
benefit/risk of the product.  
Overall, the information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the

o 
The  SST  should  include  the  symmetry  factor.  The  acceptance  criterion  for  the 
symmetry factor should meet the requirements on Eur. Ph. 2.2.46.  
Calculation formula: Note that Ph. Eur. indicates: any impurity: not more than the 
area of the peak due to doxorubicin in the chromatogram obtained with reference 
solution (b)  (0.5 per  cent).  Therefore,  the  calculation  formula  for  individual 
impurities (as % of total area) should be amended in order to guarantee that the 
individual content of each impurity is expressed relative to main component.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Doxorubicin hydrochloride, a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces 
peucetius var. caesius. Doxorubicin interferes with DNA synthesis by interacting strongly with the 
phosphate backbone of nucleic acids, presumably by specific intercalation of the planar anthracycline 
nucleus with the DNA double helix. Doxorubicin is an approved antineoplastic agent. Human tumors 
shown to be responsive to doxorubicin include acute leukemia, resistant Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's 
lymphomas, sarcoma, neuroblastoma, ovarian and endometrial carcinoma, breast carcinoma, 
bronchogenic carcinoma, lung cancer and thyroid and bladder carcinoma. AIDS-related Kaposi's 
sarcoma (KS) is somewhat responsive to doxorubicin as a single agent and in combination regimens. 
Dose dependent toxicities, including stomatitis/mucositis, nausea/vomiting, bone marrow suppression 
and cardiomyopathy, limit the amount of doxorubicin patients are able to tolerate. Conventional

liposomal formulations of doxorubicin have been proposed as a means to reduce doxorubicin-related 
toxicities and thereby improve the drug's therapeutic index. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Zolsetil Pegylated Liposomal is a long-circulating liposomal formulation of doxorubicin. This type of 
liposome contains surface-grafted segments of the hydrophilic polymer methoxypolyethylene glycol 
(MPEG). These linear MPEG groups extend from the liposome surface creating a protective coating that 
reduces interactions between the lipid bilayer membrane and plasma components. 
The critical design features of the Stealth Liposome include: 
•  
Polyethylene glycol ("Stealth" polymer) coating: reduces MPS uptake and provides long plasma 
residence times. 
•  
Average diameter of approximately 85 nm: balances drug carrying capacity and circulation 
time, and allows extravasation through endothelial defects/gaps in microvasculature of tumors. 
•  
Low permeability lipid matrix and internal aqueous buffer system: provide high drug loading 
and stable encapsulation, i.e., drug retention during residence in plasma. The "steric stabilization" 
effect provided by MPEG is believed to be responsible for the remarkable stability of Accord 
Doxorubicin in plasma. The MPEG coating also inhibits the interaction (close approach) of liposomes 
with macrophage cells, thus reducing hepatic uptake and prolonging liposome residence time in the 
circulation. 
A study evaluated whether multiple sessions of Lipo-DOX administered after FUS-induced blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) disruption (FUS-BBBD) induces severe adverse events in the normal brain tissues. While 
delivery of Lipo-DOX to the rat brain might result in minor damage, the severe neurotoxicity seen in 
earlier works does not appear to occur with delivery via FUS-BBB disruption. The damage may be 
related to capillary damage produced by inertial cavitation, which might have resulted in excessive 
doxorubicin concentrations in some areas. 
Comparative in vitro cytotoxicity of doxorubicin liposome injection and Caelyx in cancer cell 
lines  
In vitro cytotoxicity of Doxorubicin Liposome injection (Test) and Caelyx injection (Reference) were 
tested with WST-1 cell viability assay in two cancer cell lines, T47D, a human breast cancer line and 
P388, a murine leukemia cell line. The T47D cells were incubated with either Test or Reference over a 
concentration range of 0.01 and 100 μM for 96 hrs, while P388 cells were incubated over a 
concentration range of 0.001 and 10 μM for 72 hrs. Cell viability was quantified at the end of the 
incubation. The study showed comparable in vitro cytotoxicity between Test and Reference formulation 
in both T47D and P388 cells. 
The P388 cell viability vs. concentration of doxorubicin of both formulations is showed in Figure 2. The 
50% inhibition concentration (IC50) for both formulations estimated from the curves was around 0.4 
μM.  
The T47D cell viability vs. concentration of doxorubicin of both formulations is showed in Figure 3. The 
50% inhibition concentration (IC50) for both formulations estimated from the curves was around 0.9 
μM. The cytotoxicity studies showed equivalent inhibition of cancer cell lines by both formulations.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Daunorubicin,  doxorubicin,  epirubicin,  and  idarubicin  usually  are  administered  intravenously  and  are 
cleared  by  a  complex  pattern  of  hepatic  metabolism  and  biliary  excretion.  The  plasma  disappearance 
curve  for  doxorubicin  is  multiphasic,  with  elimination  half-lives  of  3  hours  and  about  30  hours.  All 
anthracyclines  are  converted  to  an  active  alcohol  intermediate  that  plays  a  variable  role  in  their 
therapeutic activity. Idarubicin has a half-life of about 15 hours, and its active metabolite, idarubicinol, 
has a half-life of about 40 hours. There is rapid uptake of the drugs in the heart, kidneys, lungs, liver, 
and spleen. They do not cross the blood-brain barrier.  
Doxorubicin is eliminated by metabolic conversion to a variety of aglycones and other inactive products. 
Doxorubicin  is  metabolized  predominantly  by  the  liver  to  the  major  metabolite,  doxorubicinol,  and 
several cytotoxic aglycone metabolites. Doxorubicinol is up to 10 times more potent than doxorubicin at 
inhibiting isometric contraction of the papillary muscle isolated from the right ventricle of rabbit heart.  
Pegylated  liposomal  doxorubicin  (doxorubicin  HCl  liposome  injection)  is  a  liposomal  formulation  of 
doxorubicin, reducing uptake by the reticulo-endothelial system due to the attachment of polyethylene 
glycol polymers to a lipid anchor and stably retaining drug as a result of liposomal entrapment via an 
ammonium sulfate chemical gradient. These features result in a pharmacokinetic profile characterized 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/212114/2022  
Page 24/46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by an extended circulation time and a reduced volume of distribution, thereby promoting tumor uptake. 
Preclinical studies demonstrated one- or two-phase plasma concentration-time profiles. Most of the drug 
is cleared with an elimination half-life of 20–30 hours. The volume of distribution is close to the blood 
volume, and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) is increased at least 60-fold compared 
with  free  doxorubicin.  Studies  of  tissue  distribution  indicated  preferential  accumulation  into  various 
implanted  tumors  and  human  tumor  xenografts,  with  an  enhancement  of  drug  concentrations  in  the 
tumor when compared with free drug. 
Comparative pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin following an intravenous administration of 
doxorubicin liposome injection (Intas) and Caelyx in female ICR (CD-1) mice. 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of doxorubicin in reference formulation, Caelyx (Janssen) and a test 
formulation, Doxorubiocin Liposome Injection (Intas) following a single intravenous (IV) dose 
administration was determined in female ICR (CD-1) mice (Study No. JIN026). Blood samples were 
collected at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hrs following each IV administration. Plasma was prepared and the 
concentrations of free (unencapsulated) and encapsulated doxorubicin in plasma sample were analyzed 
by HPLC. The major PK and relative bioavailability of free and encapsulated doxorubicin were 
calculated.  
Both free and encapsulated doxorubicin profiles were comparable between Test and Reference 
formulations. The 90% confidence interval (CI) of relative bioavailability (T/R) of both free and 
encapsulated doxorubicin was well within 80.00-125.00%, indicating the two formulations are 
bioequivalent. 
The time course of mean plasma concentrations of free doxorubicin for both formulations are shown in 
Figure 4 and encapsulated for both formulations are presented in Figure 5.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicity profile of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is characterized by dose-limiting mucosal and 
cutaneous toxicities, mild myelosuppression, decreased cardiotoxicity compared with free doxorubicin 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/212114/2022

and minimal alopecia. The mucocutaneous toxicities are dose-limiting per injection; however, the 
reduced cardiotoxicity allows a larger cumulative dose than that acceptable for free doxorubicin 
(Gabizon A et al. 2003).  
2.3.4.1.  Single dose toxicity  
In single dose studies, the acute toxicity of liposomal doxorubicin injection was similar for mice, rats, 
and dogs. In the rat, the incidence and severity of clinical observations were dose- related and 
included tail and footpad lesions, swelling and inflammation of the penis and scrotum, rough haircoat, 
alopecia, hypoactivity, hunched posture, respiratory distress, and reduced body weight gain. 
Reversible myelotoxicity was noted based on decreased RBC, WBC, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. 
Increases occurred in BUN and cholesterol levels (Product monograph, Caelyx, 2018). Dogs were the 
most sensitive species. Treatment-related toxicity included dermal toxicity, reversible myelotoxicity, 
hematologic changes, increased BUN, gastrointestinal toxicity, body weight loss, reversible cutaneous 
lesions, and alopecia. Myelotoxicity was less severe compared with the doxorubicin hydrochloride 
group. In a single dose study, MPEG-DSPE micelles, a component of the Doxorubicin liposome 
formulation, had no acute toxic effects in mice when administered at a lipid dose approximately 30-fold 
that found in the dose of 20 mg/m2 recommended for humans. The acute toxicity of doxorubicin in 
Swiss mice varies greatly according to the route of administration. The LD50 is 8.5 mg/kg by the intra-
peritoneal route, 21.1 mg/kg by the intravenous route, and greater than 750 mg/kg by the oral route. 
2.3.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity  
The toxicities of free doxorubicin (F-DOX) and liposome-associated doxorubicin (L-DOX) were 
investigated in inbred BALB/c and outbred Sabra mice treated iv with 5, 7.5, and 10 mg doxorubicin 
(DOX)/kg body weight every 2 weeks up to 8 injections and observed for 6 months. Two distinct 
patterns of death were observed: 1) an acute phase type occurring early after injection of high doses 
of DOX and apparently related to gastrointestinal toxicity and 2) a delayed phase type requiring a long 
latency after initial drug exposure and characterized by a complex pattern of abnormalities. Delivery of 
DOX by liposomes effectively protected against both types of lethal effects. Reduced toxicity of L- DOX 
resulted in reduced body and organ weight losses, reduced severity of pathologic changes, and fewer 
blood biochemical alterations. The pathological damage to the heart muscle found in mice treated with 
L-DOX was less severe than with F-DOX, and in some cases, it was reversible. Nephrotoxicity was 
extremely frequent and severe among F-DOX- treated mice, while it was totally insignificant among L-
DOX-treated mice. Hyperlipidemia, hypoglycemia, and glycogen-depleted hepatocytes were 
characteristic findings in mice treated with F-DOX. Altogether, the data obtained in this study indicate 
that liposomes significantly diminish the toxicity of DOX with the use of an intermittent schedule of 
chemotherapy.  
Repeated dose toxicity of a generic version of Doxil (Pegylated Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome), 
and Doxil were also conducted in male and female mice and rats, respectively. Mice (5 males and 5 
females in each group) received 3 i.v. injections (via tail vein) at a dose of 6 mg/kg on days 1, 8 and 
15. Rats (6 males and 6 females in each group) received an i.v. injection at dose levels of 0.5, 1.0 and 
1.5 mg/kg on days 1 and 8. The toxicity profiles of Pegylated Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome in 
both mice and rats were comparable to those of Doxil. The body weight changes from Day 1 to Day 29 
were comparable between those treated with Pegylated Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome and Doxil 
in both mice and rats. Necropsy results showed that all organ weights were within the normal limits for 
animals treated with Pegylated Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome and Doxil. There were no 
abnormal changes in Complete Blood Count and Blood Chemistry values for both male and female 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/212114/2022

animals treated with Doxil or Pegylated Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome. There were no 
histopathological changes or generic toxicity in kidneys, liver, heart, spleen and lungs in mice treated 
with either Pegylated Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome or Doxil. In rats, mild toxic effects were 
observed only in cardiac myocytes of some of the animals treated with Doxil or Pegylated Doxorubicin 
Hydrochloride Liposome. No other toxic effects in kidneys, liver, spleen and lungs were observed in any 
of the animals. It was thus concluded that Pegylated Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome have 
comparable toxicity profile to that of Doxil in both mice and rats (Ali SM et al. 2016). 
2.3.4.3.  Carcinogenicity and mutagenesis 
Doxorubicin, is both mutagenic and carcinogenic so conducting carcinogenicity and mutagenicity 
studies was not deemed necessary. Four studies were carried out with Stealth placebo liposome to 
confirm their lack of mutagenicity and genotoxicity. Negative results were obtained in the Ames, the 
L5178Y mouse lymphoma, and chromosomal aberration assays in vitro, and the mouse bone marrow 
micronucleus assay in vivo. 
Formal long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with doxorubicin. Doxorubicin and 
related compounds have been shown to have mutagenic and carcinogenic properties when tested in 
experimental models (including bacterial systems, mammalian cells in culture, and female Sprague-
Dawley rats) (Report on carcinogens, 1985; PDR, 2002; SPC, 2008; HSDB: Hazardous Substance Data 
Bank: National Library of Medicine). Doxorubicin is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen 
based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. There is inadequate evidence 
for the carcinogenicity of doxorubicin in humans (Report on carcinogens, 1985). No epidemiological 
study of doxorubicin alone was available for review. However, in one study of cancer patients receiving 
doxorubicin in combination with alkylating agents and radiotherapy, the patients developed leukemia 
and bone cancer. 
2.3.4.4.  Local tolerance 
Histopathological evaluation of the intravenous injection sites in Rabbits revealed that liposomal 
doxorubicin injection, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and placebo liposomes were well tolerated with no 
gross or microscopic evidence of irritation. In contrast, histopathological evaluation of the 
subcutaneous injection sites showed reversible mild to moderate dose-related inflammation at 
liposomal doxorubicin injection injections sites compared to moderate to severe inflammation and 
necrosis at doxorubicin hydrochloride injection sites that showed no signs of resolution during a 4-
week recovery period. 
2.3.4.5.  Other toxicity studies 
Cardiotoxicity: Cardiotoxicity is a risk of anthracycline treatment that may be manifested by early 
(i.e., acute) or late (i.e., delayed) events (Doroshow et al. 1981; Shan et al., 1996; Andersson et al. 
1999; Wang et al. 1999; Forrest et al. 2000; Olson et al. 2003; Minotti et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2006). 
Results in two species (dogs and rabbits) demonstrate that the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin is 
significantly decreased when administered as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Significantly more 
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin can be given without incurring an increased risk of cardiomyopathy 
(Working PK et al. 1999).  
Anionic liposomes containing doxorubicin were evaluated in mice for therapeutic potential in reducing 
the risks of chronic cardiotoxicity characteristic of long-term high-dose anthracycline therapy. It was 
concluded that anionic liposomes can function as efficacious carriers of doxorubicin. These vesicles 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/212114/2022  
Page 28/46 
 
 
 
possess improved therapeutic action as reflected by their ability to reduce cardiac toxicity, overcome 
growth inhibition, and increase antileukemic activity (Forssen EA et al. 1981).  
Nephrotoxicity: Renal toxicity reflected in increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels 
included tubular and/or glomerular changes and presented as renal hemorrhage and/or edema (cortex, 
pelvis or papilla), distal tubular dilatation, tubular protein casts, hypertrophy of the Bowman’s capsular 
epithelial cells, interstitial  
Administration of lip- DXR resulted in lower DXR levels in renal tissue compared to administration of 
free DXR. After administration of lip+ DXR, very low tissue and tumor DXR levels were found. The 
authors conclude that treatment with lip- DXR or lip+ DXR resulted in a prolonged survival, less 
albuminuria, and higher serum albumin levels. Also, fewer lesions in kidney was found, correlating with 
lower DXR levels in the kidney (vanHoesel QGCM et al. 1984).  
Hemolytic Potential: The hemolytic potential of liposomal doxorubicin injection and Stealth placebo 
liposomes in human blood was assessed in vitro, as well as their compatibility with human serum and 
plasma. Neither liposomal doxorubicin injection 1.0 mg/mL nor empty Stealth liposomes induced 
hemolysis of human erythrocytes, nor did either cause coagulation or precipitation of human serum or 
plasma. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is a degradation product of the phosphatidylcholine component 
of the liposomes. An additional hemolytic potential study using liposomal doxorubicin injection 
formulations prepared with 0 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL, or 0.88 mg/mL LPC caused no hemolysis of rat blood 
cells.  
Dermal Lesion Development: The effect of peak dosage and dose frequency on dermal lesion 
development and myelosuppression was studied in dogs. Liposomal doxorubicin injection 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 
mg/kg was administered q7d, q14d, or q28d by intravenous (cephalic) catheter for 6-12 weeks. The 
higher dose intensities with lower dose frequency (1.0 mg/kg q14d and 1.5 mg/kg q28d) produced 
minimal evidence of cyclic depression of hemoglobin and hematocrit. In both groups, the hemoglobin 
and hematocrit values recovered to prestudy values at the end of the study. The onset of lesions 
occurred within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of treatment and began to heal at rates that varied 
depending on lesion severity and dose frequency. Myelosuppression was mild with all treatment 
regimens and no evidence of treatment-related leukopenia was observed. Dosages of 0.5 mg/kg given 
every 2 or 4 weeks were tolerated much better than the weekly doses at 0.5 mg/kg. Comparison of 
groups that received 0.5 mg/kg/treatment showed clear dose frequency-related effects on lesion 
development, lesion severity, and general toxicity. Integration of current results with previous studies 
showed a similar frequency-dependent effect with 1.0 mg/kg; weekly and every 2-week regimens 
produced severe toxicity while a 3-week dose cycle was better tolerated.  
Stealth Liposome Placebo: In addition to the mutagenicity and developmental studies, and the 
acute and long-term studies in which placebo liposomes were used as controls, Stealth Liposome 
Placebo was evaluated for its potential to induce cardiovascular changes in dogs and neurobehavioral 
changes in rats. In the cardiovascular study, dogs showed a significant decrease in blood pressure (19-
70%) immediately after the start of dosing followed by a rapid partial recovery after the end of dosing, 
and a return to normal values within 4-6 hours post-dose. Compensating acceleration in heart rate was 
not seen. The dose rate did not affect the extent of hypotension, but inversely affected the duration. In 
the rat study, placebo liposomes did not induce any adverse neurobehavioral effects or evidence of 
neurotoxicity.  
Other toxicity Studies: The excipients in the Doxorubicin Hydrochloride concentrate for solution for 
infusion are: Fully hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC), α-(2-[1,2-distearoyl-sn 
glycero(3)phosphooxy] ethylcarbamoyl) -ω-methoxypoly(oxyethylen)-40 sodium salt (MPEG-DSPE), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/212114/2022  
Page 29/46 
 
 
 
Cholesterol, Ammonium sulphate, Sucrose, Histidine, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and water 
for injection. Suitability and safety of excipients in the formulation and the toxicity of inactive 
ingredients were discussed. The excipients presented in Doxorubicin Hydrochloride concentrate for 
solution for infusion 2 mg/ml are essentially similar to that of reference product. These excipients are 
widely used in pharmaceutical products and are well characterized. In line with EC directive 92/27 all 
excipients should be declared on the leaflet. There is no safety or clinical concerns regarding the 
presence of any of these excipients in this formulation.  
Several new studies were added to non-clinical dossier, in line with the EMA´s Reflection Paper on the 
data requirements for intravenous liposomal products developed regarding an innovator liposomal 
product (EMA/CHMP/806058/2009/Rev. 02). In the light of the studies provided by the Applicant, the 
product is comparable and has similar exposure as with the reference. Consequently, it is concluded 
that all the toxicological data generated for the reference medicinal product, can be extrapolated to 
Doxorubicin Liposome Injection (Intas), and the outcome to the comparability studies support 
equivalent toxicity. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No dedicated environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been provided. The introduction of Zolsketil 
pegylated liposomal is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales 
volumes for all Doxorubicin hydrochloride, liposomal, containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
As this is a “Hybrid” application claiming essential similarity to an existing product, no specific non-
clinical studies have been undertaken; however, an analysis of data pertaining to related substances 
and formulation supported the authorization of this product under article 10(3) of European Directive 
2001/83/EC. The non-clinical part of the submission provided considered the pharmacological and 
toxicological literature. 
The reference product (Adriamycin) contains doxorubicin hydrochloride in a different form (not 
enclosed in pegylated liposomes), whereas in the applicant’s product the active substance doxorubicin 
hydrochloride is enclosed in tiny fatty spheres called liposomes (pegylated liposomal formulation). 
Therefore, Caelyx 2 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion, which contains doxorubicin in 
pegylated liposomal form, was used for comparisons with Zolsketil pegylated liposomal.  
The cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various organs are 
thought to be related to nucleotide base intercalation and cell membrane lipid binding activities of 
doxorubicin. Intercalation inhibits nucleotide replication and action of DNA and RNA polymerases. The 
interaction of doxorubicin with topoisomerase II to form DNA-cleavable complexes appears to be an 
important mechanism of doxorubicin cytocidal activity.  
Doxorubicin and related compounds have been shown to have mutagenic and carcinogenic properties 
when tested in experimental models (including bacterial systems, mammalian cells in culture, and 
female Sprague-Dawley rats).  
Animal studies have shown activity in a spectrum of experimental tumors, immunosuppression, 
induction of a variety of toxic effects, including delayed and progressive cardiac toxicity, 
myelosuppression in all species and atrophy to testes in rats and dogs.

Zolsketil pegylated liposomal is a long-circulating liposomal formulation of doxorubicin. This type of 
liposome contains surface-grafted segments of the hydrophilic polymer methoxypolyethylene glycol 
(MPEG). These linear MPEG groups extend from the liposome surface creating a protective coating that 
reduces interactions between the lipid bilayer membrane and plasma components. The "steric 
stabilization" effect provided by MPEG is believed to be responsible for the stability of Accord 
Doxorubicin in plasma. The MPEG coating also inhibits the interaction (close approach) of liposomes 
with macrophage cells, thus reducing hepatic uptake and prolonging liposome residence time in the 
circulation. Decreased systemic elimination, increased penetration into the tumor, and long liposome 
presence with slow drug release into the tumor probably accounted for the enhanced therapeutic effect 
of doxorubicin in sterically stabilized liposomes.  
Besides, as requested, the Applicant performed several new non-clinical studies to follow the EMA 
recommendations stated in the “Reflection paper on the data requirements for intravenous liposomal 
products developed with reference an innovator liposomal product” (EMA/CHMP/806058/2009/Rev.02). 
The studies addressed specific questions of Pharmacology and, pharmacokinetics. The studies display 
similar outcome between the free and encapsulated in both products (reference and test formulations). 
Therefore, no new studies in animals are required to support the present marketing authorisation 
application. 
The Applicant conducted an in-vitro cytotoxicity study to demonstrate the similarity in 
pharmacodynamic response. To perform the mentioned test, two cancer cell line were tested T47D, a 
human breast cancer line, and P388, a murine leukaemia cell line. The cytotoxicity studies showed 
equivalent inhibition of cancer cell lines by both formulations i.e. test product and reference product. 
The Applicant conducted two in vivo tests to address the pharmacokinetic studies question inquiry by 
EMA´s reflection paper “Reflection paper on the data requirements for intravenous liposomal products 
developed regarding an innovator liposomal product” (EMA/CHMP/806058/2009/Rev. 02), a 
comparative pharmacokinetic study in mice; and a distribution study in mice. Both studies displayed a 
similar outcome between the free and encapsulated doxorubicin in both products (reference vs test 
formulation). After one single intravenous dose administration in female ICR mice, the plasma 
concentration for encapsulated and unencapsulated remains at comparable levels. Secondly, a 
distribution study was conducted in mice and compared to human data (reference and a test 
formulation). The result displays similar data between the free and encapsulated in both products 
(reference vs test formulation) either in the volume of distribution and clearance. 
Some impurities are present at higher than the qualification threshold, this may be considered 
acceptable, based on levels found in the EU and US originator product, which are considered as 
qualified. 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
The applicant has submitted a review of the doxorubicin active-product-ingredient (API) consumption 
from year 2017 to year 2019 (data not shown). According to the EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1 
guideline, the introduction of Zolsketil pegylated liposomal is considered unlikely to result in any 
significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all Doxorubicin hydrochloride, liposomal, 
containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance, and not further 
studies on environmental risk assessment are necessary. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant presented new studies to confirm the similarity between the reference product and the 
test product. The studies display similar outcomes in cytotoxicity, volume of distribution and clearance

between the reference and the test product. Considering all the results provided (bibliographic and new 
studies) and acknowledging that the Applicant follows the EMA´s reflection paper on the data 
requirements for intravenous liposomal products developed regarding an innovator liposomal product 
(EMA/CHMP/806058/2009/Rev. 02), and, takes into account the principles of the EMEA´s 3R Guideline 
on the principles of regulatory acceptance of 3Rs (replacement, reduction, refinement) testing 
approaches, no further animal studies are required to support the present marketing authorisation 
application. 
The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The reference medicinal product (Adriamycin) contains doxorubicin hydrochloride (not enclosed in 
pegylated liposomes), whereas in the Applicant’s product the active substance doxorubicin 
hydrochloride is enclosed in tiny fatty spheres called liposomes (pegylated liposomal formulation). 
Therefore, Caelyx 2 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion, which contains doxorubicin in 
pegylated liposomal form was used for comparisons with the Applicant’s product. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of doxorubicin based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the 
SmPC of the reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Reflection paper on the data requirements for intravenous liposomal 
products developed with reference to an innovator liposomal product (EMA/CHMP/806058/2009/Rev. 
02), the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) as well as 
the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09), <Question number 4 
of the Questions & Answers: Generic Applications” (CMDh/272/2009/Rev. 03, December 2017) and 
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride concentrate for solution 2 mg/ml product-specific 
bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/800775/2017) are of particular relevance. 
GCP aspect 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
To support the application, the Applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study, “a multicentre, open 
label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single dose, cross-over, 
bioequivalence study of Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal) in comparison with Caelyx 
[Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal)] in patients with ovarian cancer”.

hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal) in comparison with Caelyx [Doxorubicin Hydrochloride 
(Pegylated Liposomal)] in patients with ovarian cancer. 
Methods 
•  Study design  
This was a multicenter, open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, 
single dose, cross-over, bioequivalence study. There was at least 28 days of washout period between 
first dosing of IMP administration in the two periods. Window period of +14 days for adverse event 
management was allowed between two periods of the study. 
As per the protocol, a total of fifty (50) samples (25 samples in each period), each of 5 mL were 
collected from each patient during the study. 
The venous blood samples were withdrawn at pre-dose (0.000 hour) and at 0.333, 0.667, 1.000*, 
1.250, 1.500, 1.750, 2.000, 2.500, 3.000, 4.000, 5.000, 6.000, 8.000, 12.000, 16.000, 24.000, 
48.000, 72.000, 120.000, 168.000, 216.000, 264.000, 312.000 and 360.000 hours after first-dose 
administration in each period. Blood sample at 72.000, 120.000, 168.000, 216.000, 264.000, 312.000 
and 360.000 hours were collected on an ambulatory basis. 
*That was the adjustable time-point: The sample was taken immediately at the end of infusion (1 hour 
± 5 minutes). 
Pre-dose blood sample were collected within 5 minutes prior to dosing. A deviation of ± 1 minute was 
allowed for samples to be collected during infusion up to the end of infusion. A deviation of ± 2 
minutes was allowed for post-dose samples up to 48 hours. The ambulatory samples were collected at 
an allowable deviation of ± 2 hours. All deviations outside the range allowed as above were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/212114/2022  
Page 33/46 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
documented as protocol deviations.  
The actual time of sample collection was reported in eCRF. 
The blood samples were withdrawn using pre-labelled syringe and transferred into pre-chilled 
(maintained at temperature of 2 to 8°C), vacutainers containing K3EDTA as the anticoagulant, kept in 
ice cold water bath (maintained at temperature of 2 to 8°C). 
Treatments administered and method of administration 
After an overnight fast of at least 8 hours, the patients were served with a non-high fat breakfast, 
which they consumed completely within 30 minutes. The breakfast derived approximately 15-20%, 60-
65%, and 20-25% calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat respectively. The IMP was administered 
at two hours (± 10 minutes) after serving of breakfast. They were administered 50 mg/m2 dose (based 
on BSA) of either the test or reference product as per the randomisation schedule on the first day of 
the chemotherapy cycle under fasting condition (Day 1) in Period-I. Patients were crossed over to the 
other arm in Period-II (Day 29). 
The IMP was administered by intravenous infusion after dilution over 1 hour (+ 5 minutes window 
period). 
The sampling schedule is considered adequate. It is necessary to take sample beyond 72 h because 
this is not an immediate release product, but a prolonged release product. Samples up to 360 h are 
considered sufficient. 
The washout period of at least 28 days between the dosing days is considered sufficient for 
encapsulated, unencapsulated and total doxorubicin taking into account the half-life described for 
encapsulated doxorubicin of 73 h. However, pre-dose values were observed for subjects 10102 
(169.980 ng/mL) and 10202 (168.189 ng/mL) for encapsulated doxorubicin and subjects 10202 (8.033 
ng/mL) and 10104 (37.637 ng/mL) for unencapsulated doxorubicin. Only in the last case the pre-dose 
level is higher than 5% of the corresponding Cmax. This profile was excluded from statistical 
calculations. 
Further, the dosing interval is in line with the recommended posology of one dose once every 4 weeks 
as this BE study is conducted in ovarian cancer patients. 
Conducting the bioequivalence study with standardized light meals due to patient’s needs is 
appropriate and in line with the product-specific bioequivalence guidance. Moreover, the relative caloric 
content (approximately 15-20%, 60-65%, and 20-25% calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat 
respectively) is considered also acceptable. The detailed composition of the meal is not described, but 
it is not considered critical. 
The administration of the meal two hours before drug product administration is considered acceptable 
since this product is not an orally administered product. 
•  Test and reference products  
Test and reference product information is presented below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/212114/2022  
Page 34/46 
 
 
 
 
•  Population(s) studied 
The sample size computation was determined considering the following assumptions: 
−  T/R ratio = 95.0-105.0% 
− 
Intra-patient CV (%) ~ 35% 
−  Significance Level = 5% 
−  Power ≥ 80% 
−  Bioequivalence Limits = 80.00-125.00% 
Based on the above estimates, 52 completers were required to establish bioequivalence between 
formulations with adequate power. Considering approximately 20% dropout and/or withdrawn, 66 
patients were sufficient to establish bioequivalence between formulations with adequate power for this 
study. 
Patient with confirmed ovarian cancer whose disease has progressed or recurred after platinum-based 
Chemotherapy who are already receiving or scheduled to start the therapy with Doxorubicin HCl 
(Pegylated Liposomal) 2 mg/mL (20 mg/10 mL) concentrate for solution for infusion. Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2. Cardiac function (left ventricular ejection 
fraction [LVEF] ≥ 50%. 
A total of 66 patients were dosed in the trial as per the randomization schedule. Out of these, a total of 
15 patients discontinued/ were withdrawn. 
In all, a total of 50 patients completed the clinical phase of the study successfully and were used in the 
pharmacokinetics and statistical analysis with the exception of one patient (Period-I) whose pre-dose 
concentration was > 5% of Cmax for unencapsulated doxorubicin. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics are presented in the following table:

Prophylactic Inj. Granisetron (Antiemetic) 2 mg IV (30 minutes prior) and Inj. Dexamethasone 8 mg 
(45 minutes prior) (to avoid hypersensitivity reaction) were given to all the patients before IMP 
administration in both the periods. Prophylactic anti-allergy treatment and G-CSF are permitted at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
•  Analytical methods 
Pre-study validation 
The concentrations of unencapsulated doxorubicin (non-liposomal, free) and encapsulated doxorubicin 
in human plasma were determined using two separate LC-MS/MS methods. Apparently, the pre-study 
validation of both methods are satisfactory. Both methods met the acceptance criteria for all the 
validation parameters evaluated, demonstrating acceptable performance. In addition, the analyte 
stability was demonstrated. The analytical range for unencapsulated doxorubicin was modified to 4.063 
ng /mL - 750.770 ng/ mL] in the partial validation (MV(I)-205-16 (A-IV). This new calibration range 
met also the acceptance criteria or all the validation parameters evaluated. The long-term stability 
data in frozen human plasma stored at -65 ºC was demonstrated in K3EDTA for 280 days for 
unencapsulated doxorubicin and at least 250 days for encapsulated doxorubicin and it covers the 
maximum storage samples at -65 ºC [i.e., 232 days at -65±10˚C for unencapsulated doxorubicin 
(June 06th, 2018 to January 23th, 2019 for Patient No. 10202 and 243 days at -65±10˚C for 
encapsulated doxorubicin (May 28th, 2018 to January 25th, 2019 for Patient No. 10802)]. 
In-study validation: 
The calibration standards of the in-study validation were acceptable, although, for encapsulated 
doxorubicin the processing of calibrators, QC samples and study samples should be identical. However, 
in the determination of encapsulated doxorubicin the calibrators and QC samples prepared with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/212114/2022  
Page 36/46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
working solutions were extracted by protein precipitation, whereas the QC samples prepared with the 
formulation and the study samples were extracted by solid phase extraction. In the submitted 
response the Applicant has clarified these concerns. 
Encapsulated doxorubicin 
The reasons for reanalysis of the individual samples for unencapsulated doxorubicin (significant analyte 
concentration in pre-dose sample, concentration above highest standard, poor chromatography and 
significant variation in response of internal) and for encapsulated doxorubicin (significant analyte 
concentration in pre-dose sample of patient, and laboratory accident) are acceptable. In addition, one 
run for unencapsulated doxorubicin and four runs for encapsulated doxorubicin were re-analysed due 
to the runs did not meet the acceptance criteria. In addition, fifty samples (50) were reanalysed due to 
the run did not meet the analytical run acceptance. 
Dilution of some samples for unencapsulated doxorubicin was necessary (a dilution factor x5 was 
validated; the maximum Cmax was 1466.705 ng/mL). 
Dilution of some samples for encapsulated doxorubicin was not necessary (the maximum Cmax was 
54,163.493 ng/mL). 
Neither a sample re-integration nor a sample re-injection was performed for encapsulated doxorubicin. 
For unencapsulated doxorubicin, the re-injection and the re-integration of the samples were carried out 
according to the internal SOPs. The applicant submitted a table concerning the re-integration of 
chromatograms for free doxorubicin and a table concerning the reanalysis of samples runs containing 
subjects No. 11003 and 10401, including the original and the repeated concentration values. The ISR 
was performed in a total of 125 samples for each analyte, which is in accordance with section 6 
“Incurred Samples reanalysis” of the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation that require at least 
194 samples out of 2876 (10% of the samples should be reanalysed in case the number of samples is 
less than 1000 samples and 5% of the number of samples exceeding 1000 samples). For the samples 
reanalysed, the ISR was acceptable as 90.7% (195 samples out of 215 samples) and 76.7% (165 
samples out of 215 samples) of the samples reanalysed for encapsulated and unencapsulated 
doxorubicin, respectively, were within the acceptance range (± 20%). 
•  Pharmacokinetic variables 
The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated: 
Primary pharmacokinetic parameters 
Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for unencapsulated and encapsulated doxorubicin. 
Secondary pharmacokinetic parameters 
Tmax, AUC0-48, AUC48-t, λz, t½, AUC_%Extrap_obs, Cl and Vd for unencapsulated and encapsulated 
doxorubicin. 
These parameters were derived individually for each analysed patient from the concentration vs. time 
profiles of Encapsulated and unencapsulated Doxorubicin in plasma using non-compartmental of 
Phoenix WinNonlin. 
The selected primary pharmacokinetics variables are not completely in line with the product-specific 
guidance for liposomal doxorubicin, because the partial AUC should have been considered as primary 
PK parameters for the encapsulated doxorubicin to ensure profile comparability. In any case, the 
Applicant has submitted these partial AUC and we have considered them as primary. 
Pharmacokinetic software is considered acceptable and the method of Cmax and AUC estimation is 
correct since the linear trapezoidal method was employed as described in the protocol. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/212114/2022  
Page 37/46 
 
 
 
According to the product-specific guidance for liposomal doxorubicin, only encapsulated drug and 
unencapsulated drug need to be analysed, but both have to be quantified separately. 
For unencapsulated doxorubicin the results of two samples have been excluded for the analysis 
because of suspected mishandling of the samples at the clinical site, which cannot be accepted. The 
Applicant has conducted new pharmacokinetic calculations again with the original concentrations of the 
samples from patients 10204 and 11111 (please refer to the results section). 
•  Statistical methods 
The statistical software and method is considered the correct method to be employed. 
The calculation of the 90% CI of the test / reference ratio of the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
interest is based on an ANOVA analysis containing the centre factor because it was defined so in the 
protocol. In addition, the centre effect was significant in several PK parameters (Encapsulated 
doxorubicin Cmax, AUCt, AUCinf, AUC0-48 and AUC48-t and unencapsulated doxorubicin Cmax, AUCt, 
AUCinf, AUC40-t), except for unencapsulated doxorubicin AUC0-48 h with P value = 0.0512), according 
to the ANOVAs reported by the Applicant. In the assessor opinion the existence of a significant centre 
effect is not relevant since patients in the difference centers may exhibit different demographic 
characteristics, which are likely responsible for the different exposure in the centers. In addition, the 
number of patients per centre is very limited and some of the centers were pooled. 
The Applicant has also submitted an additional pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis that was 
performed using the original concentration values to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters of 
unencapsulated Doxorubicin and these results show that the 90% CI of all the primary PK parameters 
remains within the acceptance criteria of 80.00-125.00% (see results section).

Linear and log-linear plots have been submitted for both analytes. 
A pre-dose concentration levels were detected for subjects 10202 (8.033 ng/mL) and 10104 (37.637 
ng/mL) for unencapsulated doxorubicin and subjects 10102 (169.980 ng/mL) and 10202 (167.189 
ng/mL) for encapsulated doxorubicin. For subject 10104, the pre-dose value was > 5% of Cmax (95.063 
ng/mL), hence this subject was excluded from the statistical analysis. This is considered acceptable in 
accordance with the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence. For the rest of the subjects the 
pre-dose values were < 5% of their respective Cmax and were included in the statistical analysis.

No tmax was observed at the first sample time point for both analytes. 
The LLOQ was 4.133 ng/mL for unencapsulated doxorubicin, therefore, it was not sensitive enough to 
detect levels of 5% of the minimum Cmax (3.2884 ng/mL is the 5% of the minimum Cmax= 65.768 
ng/mL), but it was sensitive enough to detect levels of the 5% of the mean Cmax (7.248 ng/mL is the 
5% of the mean Cmax= 144.967 ng/mL). 
The LLOQ was 151.002 ng/mL for encapsulated doxorubicin, therefore, it was sensitive enough to 
detect levels of 5% of the minimum Cmax (1379.458 ng/mL is the 5% of the minimum Cmax= 
27,589.161 ng/mL). 
The AUC estimated is considered representative enough of the extent of absorption/exposure since the 
extrapolation is lower than 20% in all individual profiles for both analytes with the exception of subject 
10604 (25.823%) for encapsulated doxorubicin of the test product and subjects 10203 (48.928%), 
10604 (34.915%) and 11102 (22.294%) for unencapsulated doxorubicin of the test product and 
subject 10403 (23.589%) for reference product. This is considered acceptable in accordance with the 
Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence. 
For encapsulated doxorubicin and unencapsulated doxorubicin it can be concluded that the 90% CI for 
AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax and partial AUC (AUC0-48h and AUC48-t) were within the 80.00% to 125.00% 
acceptance criterion. Therefore, bioequivalence has been demonstrated for these two types of 
doxorubicin (encapsulated and unencapsulated). The Applicant has submitted additional 
pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses that were performed using the original concentration values to 
calculate pharmacokinetic parameters of unencapsulated Doxorubicin and these results show that the 
90% CI of all the primary PK parameters remains within the acceptance criteria of 80.00-125.00%.  
•  Safety data 
A total of 66 patients were dosed at least once and were included in safety evaluation. A total of two 
hundred and thirty-one (231) adverse events (AEs) were reported by forty (40) patients during the 
conduct of study. As per CTCAE, of the two hundred and thirty-one (231) adverse events, one hundred 
and forty (140) AEs were classified under Grade 1 (mild), fifty-nine (59) AEs were classified under 
Grade 2 (moderate), twenty-six (26) AEs were classified under Grade 3 (severe) and six (6) AEs were 
classified under Grade 5 (death related to AE). 
The causality assessment was judged as unlikely for one hundred and thirty-four (134) AEs, as 
probable/likely for sixty (60) AEs, as possible for thirty-one (31) AEs and as certain for six (6) AEs to 
the study drug administered. 
One hundred and twenty-five (125) AEs were reported after administration of Test Product-T and one 
hundred and six (106) AEs were reported after administration of Reference Product-R. 
The outcome of the adverse event was “recovered without sequelae” for two hundred and nine (209) 
AEs, “unknown” for nine (9) AEs, “death” for six (6) AEs, “change in severity” for five (5) AEs, “not yet 
recovered ” for one (1) AE and “stable” for one (1) AE. 
There were ten (10) SAEs reported during the study. Out of which, one (1) SAE was sudden death and 
from the remaining nine (9) SAEs, five (5) SAEs resulted in death of 2 patients. Hence, a total of three 
(3) patients died during the study. 
The outcome of the SAEs was “recovered without sequelae” for two (2) SAEs, “unknown” for one (1) 
SAE, “death” for six (6) SAEs and “change in severity” for one (1) SAE. 
The causality assessment was judged as unlikely for nine (9) SAEs (including 3 deaths) and possible 
for one (1) SAE.

2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The application is for a hybrid medicinal product of the reference product Adriamycin 2 mg/mL Solution 
for Injection, which has been authorized nationally in Denmark on 24th October 1979. The proposed 
indications for the developed product are the same indications of the centrally authorised product 
Caelyx 2 mg/mL Concentrate for Solution for Infusion of Janssen-Cilag International NV. 
To support the application, the Applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study, “a multicentre, open 
label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single dose, cross-over, 
bioequivalence study of Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal) in comparison with Caelyx 
[Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Pegylated Liposomal)] in patients with ovarian cancer”. 
The Applicant has stated that the trial has been conducted in compliance with GCP and GLP 
requirements, and the monitoring reports of the bioequivalence study have been submitted. Both, 
clinical and analytical sites were inspected by the European Authorities. 
The test and reference (from the Romanian market) products and the mode of administration are 
adequate in accordance with Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride concentrate for solution 2 
mg/ml product-specific bioequivalence guidance. Further, the dosing interval is in line with the 
recommended posology of one dose once every 4 weeks as this BE study is conducted in ovarian 
cancer patients.  
Both batches were tested before expiry date and the CoA shows a similar content. Therefore, content 
correction is not necessary.  
The provided comparative bioavailability study is appropriate in accordance with pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin hydrochloride concentrate for solution 2 mg/mL product-specific bioequivalence guidance, 
that require a single dose study with standardized light meals rather than in the fasting state due to 
patient’s needs (please refer to mode of administration). In addition, the study was carried out in 
patients with ovarian cancer, which is also in accordance with the product-specific bioequivalence 
guidance. 
Conducting the bioequivalence study with standardized light meals due to patient’s needs is 
appropriate and in line with the product-specific bioequivalence guidance.  
A total of 66 patients were dosed in the trial as per the randomization schedule. The number of 
subjects is adequate to show equivalence based on the intra-subject variability obtained from in house 
data. Out of these, a total of 15 patients discontinued/ were withdrawn. 
The subject withdrawals due to adverse events (subjects 10701 and 10503), protocol non-compliance 
(subject 11005), due to disease progression (subject 10807), died during the study (subjects 10501, 
10602 and 10902), lost to follow-up (subject 10903) and dropout (freely of consent; 10305, 10806, 
10904, 10906, 11004, 11103 and 10802) are considered to be acceptable. The exclusion of patient 
10104 from the statistical analysis due to pre-dose concentration > 5% of Cmax for unencapsulated 
doxorubicin is considered acceptable in accordance with the Guideline on investigation of 
bioequivalence. This pre-dose level occurred in period 1, which may be understood as he/she was a 
patient. 
Assessment report

The study population is considered acceptable with regards to demographic characteristics and the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered to be acceptable. 
The study patient population is in line with the recommendation of the product-specific bioequivalence 
guidance (stable ovarian/breast cancer patients) and with the therapeutic indications of the reference 
product used in the BE study. 
The concentrations of unencapsulated doxorubicin (non-liposomal, free) and encapsulated doxorubicin 
in human plasma were determined using two separate LC-MS/MS methods.  
The selected primary pharmacokinetics variables (i.e., Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞) were not completely 
adequate for this study, since partial AUCs are also required in the product-specific guidance for 
liposomal doxorubicin. The Applicant has submitted them and these were considered as secondary PK 
parameters. 
The applied statistical methodology is adequate and in accordance with the Guideline requirements. A 
Statistical Analysis Plan is presented in appendix 16.1.9.4 of the Clinical Study Report, with details on 
the statistical analysis. ANOVA model includes clinical site as a factor. The center effect was assessed 
by the applicant with MS error as denominator at it should be the MSsubject(sequence*center). With 
the correct analysis it has not been detected a centre effect. Therefore, the differences between 
centers are not significant compared with the existing variability. 
It could be considered more relevant to conduct the ANOVA including additionally the centre-by-
formulation interaction in order to assess if the ratio T/R is consistent in all centers. This exploratory 
analysis is not proposed to estimate the 90% CI of the ratio T/R of the primary PK parameters, since 
the estimation would be biased when the number of subjects per center is disbalanced, but it is 
considered valuable to give consistency to the study results. These analyses have been conducted by 
the assessment teams and no center-by-formulation interaction has been detected. The centre effect is 
not considered relevant, the conventional ANOVA ignoring the centre, i.e. including only formulation, 
period, sequence and subject (sequence) has been calculated and the corresponding 90% confidence 
interval of the ratio test / reference of the PK parameters of interest are similar to those reported by 
the MAH based on the ANOVA including the centre without centre-by-formulation interaction. 
Therefore, this sensitivity analysis confirms the bioequivalence of the product. 
For encapsulated doxorubicin and unencapsulated doxorubicin it was concluded that the 90% CI for 
AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax and partial AUC (AUC0-48h and AUC48-t) were within the 80.00% to 125.00% 
acceptance criterion. Therefore, bioequivalence has been considered as appropriately demonstrated for 
these two substances. However, for unencapsulated doxorubicin this conclusion was only achieved 
after the presentation of the outcome of new calculations that were repeated with the original values of 
two samples that were previously excluded (not reportable) due to pharmacokinetic reasons. 
The safety profile of both products seems to be comparable, although it is obvious that the design was 
not powered to compare the safety profile. No difference in the safety profile can be anticipated. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Zolsketil pegylated liposomal is considered bioequivalent 
with Caelyx.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This centralised procedure concerns a hybrid application for Zolsketil pegylated liposomal 2 mg/ml 
concentrate for dispersion for infusion (pegylated liposomal formulation) with Adriamycin 2 mg/ml 
solution for injection (non-pegylated liposomal formulation) as reference medicinal product. However, 
since Caelyx contains doxorubicin hydrochloride in a pegylated liposomal formulation, it was 
considered an appropriate comparator. Therefore, the indications applied for this new medicinal 
product are the same as those authorised for Caelyx: “As monotherapy for patients with metastatic 
breast cancer, where there is an increased cardiac risk. For treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in 
women who have failed a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. In combination with 
bortezomib for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least 
one prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for bone marrow transplant. For 
treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in patients with low CD4 counts (<200 CD4 
lymphocytes/mm3) and extensive mucocutaneous or visceral disease”. 
Nonclinical studies have been provided for this application and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
The bioavailability study in patients with ovarian cancer forms the pivotal basis with an open label, 
randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single dose, cross-over, design. The study 
design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioavailability of this formulation and was in line with 
the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well 
as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and 
statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Zolsketil pegylated liposomal met the protocol-defined criteria for 
bioequivalence when compared with Caelyx. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals 
for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-72h, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined 
acceptance range. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus decision is of the opinion that Zolsketil pegylated liposomal is not similar to 
Zejula, Kyprolis, Farydak, Ninlaro, Imnovid, Darzalex, Abecma and Blenrep within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. (See appendix)  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Zolsketil pegylated liposomal is favourable in the following indication: 
ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal is indicated: 
- 
- 
As monotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer, where there is an increased cardiac 
risk. 
For treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in women who have failed a first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.

- 
In combination with bortezomib for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients 
who have received at least one prior therapy and who have already undergone or are 
unsuitable for bone marrow transplant. 
- 
For treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in patients with low CD4 counts (< 200 
CD4 lymphocytes/mm3) and extensive mucocutaneous or visceral disease. 
ZOLSKETIL  pegylated  liposomal  may  be  used  as  first-line  systemic  chemotherapy,  or  as  second  line 
chemotherapy in AIDS-KS patients with disease that has progressed with, or in patients intolerant to, 
prior  combination  systemic  chemotherapy  comprising  at  least  two  of  the  following  agents:  a  vinca 
alkaloid, bleomycin and standard doxorubicin (or other anthracycline). 
ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal is indicated in adults.

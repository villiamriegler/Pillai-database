Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for carfilzomib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Following a request from the PRAC, the MAH provided a full assessment of all reported cases using the 
‘Hearing impairment’ Standardized MedDRA Query (narrow). Review of the MAH’s clinical trials and safety 
database retrieved a high number of cases of tinnitus. Considering the imbalance observed in completed 
randomized controlled trials, short last dose latency, plausible mechanism of action (accumulation of un-
degraded, potentially sensorineural and ototoxic proteins) and a potential class effect with tinnitus listed 
as adverse drug reaction for bortezomib, the PRAC concluded that tinnitus should be added as a new 
adverse drug reaction with a frequency ‘common’ in section 4.8 of the SmPC and section 4 of Package 
Leaflet. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for carfilzomib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing carfilzomib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

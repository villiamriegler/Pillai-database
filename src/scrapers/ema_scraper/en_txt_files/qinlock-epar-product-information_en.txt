CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
QINLOCK is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal 
tumour (GIST) who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including 
imatinib. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
QINLOCK should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the administration of anticancer agents. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 150 mg ripretinib (three 50 mg tablets) taken once daily at the same time 
each day with or without food. 
If the patient misses a dose of QINLOCK within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient 
should be instructed to take it as soon as possible and then take the next dose at the regularly 
scheduled time. If a patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the 
patient should be instructed not to take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule 
on the following day. 
In case of vomiting after QINLOCK administration, the patient should not take a replacement dose 
and should resume the dosing schedule the next day at the usual time. 
Treatment with QINLOCK should continue as long as benefit is observed or until unacceptable 
toxicity (see section 4.4).

If Grade 3 or 4 recurs, permanently discontinue. 
Concomitant medicinal products 
Concomitant medicinal products that are strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A should be avoided 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). If a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer must be co-administered, the 
QINLOCK dosing frequency may be increased during the co-administration period. For strong 
inducers, the dose may be increased from 150 mg once daily to 150 mg twice daily. For patients taking 
QINLOCK twice daily, if the patient misses a dose within 4 hours of the time it is usually taken, the 
3 
 
 
 
patient should be instructed to take the missed dose as soon as possible and then take the next dose at 
the regularly scheduled time. If a patient misses a dose by more than 4 hours of the time it is usually 
taken, the patient should be instructed not to take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing 
schedule. Close monitoring of overall efficacy and safety is recommended in these patients. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment  
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (see 
section 5.2). Only limited clinical data are available in patients with severe renal impairment 
[creatinine clearance (CLcr) <30 mL/min]. A recommended dose of QINLOCK has not been 
established in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment  
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) 
or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Data in patients with severe hepatic impairment is 
limited, thus close monitoring of overall safety is recommended in these patients. 
Elderly  
In clinical studies, no clinically relevant differences were observed between elderly (aged >65 years) 
and younger patients (aged ≤ 65 and ≥ 18 years) (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of QINLOCK in children below 18 years of age have not been established (see 
section 5.1). No data are available.  
Method of administration  
QINLOCK is for oral use.  
The tablets should be taken at the same time each day with or without food (see section 5.2).  
Prescribers should instruct patients to swallow the tablets whole and not to chew, split, or crush them. 
Patients should not ingest the tablets if they are broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact as the 
potential effects of these alterations have not been evaluated. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysaesthesia Syndrome (PPES) 
PPES occurred in patients treated with ripretinib (see section 4.8). Based on severity, ripretinib should 
be withheld and then resumed at the same or reduced dose (see section 4.2). 
Hypertension 
Hypertension was observed with ripretinib (see section 4.8). Ripretinib must not be initiated unless 
blood pressure is adequately controlled. Blood pressure is to be monitored as clinically indicated. 
Based on severity, ripretinib should be withheld and then resumed at same or reduced dose or 
permanently discontinue (see section 4.2). 
Cardiac failure 
Cardiac failure (including cardiac failure, cardiac failure acute, acute left ventricular failure, and 
diastolic dysfunction) was observed with ripretinib (see section 4.8). Ejection fraction should be 
assessed by echocardiogram or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan prior to initiating ripretinib 
and during treatment, as clinically indicated. Ripretinib should be permanently discontinued for Grade 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 or 4 left ventricular systolic dysfunction (see section 4.2). The safety of ripretinib has not been 
assessed in patients with a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction below 50%. 
Cutaneous malignancies 
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CuSCC) and melanoma were reported in patients receiving 
ripretinib (see section 4.8). Dermatological evaluations should be performed when initiating ripretinib 
and routinely during treatment. Suspicious skin lesions should be managed with excision and 
dermatopathological evaluation. Ripretinib should be continued at the same dose. 
Wound healing complications 
No formal studies to evaluate the effect of ripretinib on wound healing have been conducted. Impaired 
wound healing complications may occur in patients who receive medicinal products that inhibit the 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathway. Therefore, ripretinib has the potential 
to adversely affect wound healing.  
Treatment with ripretinib is to be withheld for at least 3 days prior to and after minor surgery and at 
least 5 days prior to and after major surgery. Ripretinib may then be resumed after surgery based on 
clinical judgement of adequate wound healing.  
Embryo-foetal toxicity 
Based on findings from animal studies, ripretinib can cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant 
women (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). It is recommended to advise women to avoid pregnancy while 
taking ripretinib. The pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential must be verified prior to 
initiating ripretinib and during treatment. Females of reproductive potential and males with female 
partners of reproductive potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 
1 week after the final dose of ripretinib (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). Effects of ripretinib on 
contraceptive steroids have not been studied. A barrier method contraception should be added if 
systemic contraceptive steroids are used. 
Phototoxicity 
Ripretinib exhibits a potential for phototoxicity (see section 5.3). It is recommended to advise patients 
to avoid or minimise exposure to direct sunlight, sunlamps, and other sources of ultraviolet radiation 
due to the risk of phototoxicity associated with ripretinib. Patients should be instructed to use 
measures such as protective clothing (long sleeves and hat) and sunscreen with high sun protection 
factor (SPF). 
CYP3A inhibitors and inducers 
Ripretinib is a CYP3A substrate. Concurrent administration of ripretinib with the strong CYP3A and 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor itraconazole resulted in an increase in ripretinib plasma exposure (see 
section 4.5). Caution is required when administering ripretinib with agents that are strong CYP3A and 
P-gp inhibitors. 
Concurrent administration of ripretinib with the strong CYP3A inducer rifampicin resulted in a 
decrease in ripretinib plasma exposure. Therefore, chronic administration of agents that are strong or 
moderate CYP3A inducers with ripretinib should be avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
Important information about some excipients  
QINLOCK contains lactose.  
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Both ripretinib and its active metabolite DP-5439 are mainly cleared by CYP3A4/5 and are substrates 
of P-gp and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect of other medicinal products on ripretinib 
Effect of strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors 
Co-administration of itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) and also a P-gp inhibitor increased 
ripretinib Cmax by 36% and AUC0-∞ by 99%. DP-5439 Cmax was unchanged; AUC0-∞ increased by 99%. 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A/P-gp (e.g. ketoconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, itraconazole, 
ritonavir, posaconazole, and voriconazole) are to be used with caution and patients should be 
monitored. Ingestion of grapefruit juice is not recommended.  
Effect of CYP3A inducers 
Co-administration of QINLOCK with the strong CYP3A inducer rifampicin decreased ripretinib Cmax 
by 18% and AUC0-∞ by 61%, decreased DP-5439 AUC0-∞ by 57%, and increased DP-5439 Cmax by 
37%. 
Concomitant use of QINLOCK with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
rifampicin, phenobarbital and St. John’s wort) and moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. efavirenz and 
etravirine) must therefore be avoided. If a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer must be 
co-administered, the QINLOCK dosing frequency may be increased during the co-administration 
period. For strong inducers, the dose may be increased from 150 mg once daily to 150 mg twice daily. 
For patients taking QINLOCK twice daily, if the patient misses a dose within 4 hours of the time it is 
usually taken, the patient should be instructed to take the missed dose as soon as possible and then 
take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. If a patient misses a dose by more than 4 hours of 
the time it is usually taken, the patient should be instructed not to take the missed dose and simply 
resume the usual dosing schedule. Monitor for clinical response and tolerability.  
Effect of acid-reducing agents 
No clinically significant differences in the plasma exposure to ripretinib and DP-5439 were observed 
when QINLOCK was co-administered with pantoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor). 
Drug transporter systems 
Based on in vitro data, medicinal products that are inhibitors of BCRP (e.g. cyclosporine A, 
eltrombopag) should be used with caution in combination with QINLOCK, as increased plasma 
concentrations of ripretinib or DP-5439 may be possible. 
Effect of ripretinib on other medicinal products  
CYP isoform-selective substrates  
In vitro studies suggested ripretinib may inhibit CYP2C8. QINLOCK is to be used with caution in 
combination with substrates of CYP2C8 (e.g. repaglinide, paclitaxel), as co-administration may lead to 
increased exposure of CYP2C8 substrates. 
The in vivo net effect of inhibition of CYP3A4 in the intestine and systemic CYP3A4 induction is 
unknown. Caution is recommended when co-administering ripretinib with sensitive CYP3A4 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus) or that are mostly 
metabolised in the intestine (e.g. midazolam).  
Ripretinib and DP-5439 induced CYP2B6 in vitro. Co-administration of ripretinib with CYP2B6 
substrates with narrow therapeutic index (e.g. efavirenz) may lead to loss of their efficacy. 
Ripretinib and DP-5439 down-regulated CYP1A2 in vitro. Co-administration of ripretinib with 
CYP1A2 substrates with narrow therapeutic index (e.g. tizanidine) may lead to increased 
concentrations and monitoring is recommended. 
It is unknown whether ripretinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal 
contraceptives, and therefore women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should add a 
barrier method. 
Drug transporter systems  
In vitro studies suggested ripretinib is an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. DP-5439 is a substrate for P-gp 
and BCRP. DP-5439 is an inhibitor of BCRP and Multidrug And Toxin Protein 1 (MATE-1). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicinal products that are P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. digoxin, dabigatran 
etexilate) should be used with caution in combination with QINLOCK due to the likelihood of 
increased plasma concentrations of these substrates.  
QINLOCK is to be used with caution in combination with BCRP substrates (e.g. rosuvastatin, 
sulfasalazine and irinotecan) and MATE-1 substrates (e.g. metformin) as co-administration of 
QINLOCK with BCRP and MATE-1 substrates may lead to an increase of their exposure. Clinical 
studies with BCRP or MATE-1 substrates have not been conducted. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential and men with female partners of reproductive potential must be 
informed that QINLOCK may cause foetal harm and must ensure effective contraception during 
treatment and for at least 1 week after the final dose of QINLOCK (see section 4.4)  
The pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential is to be verified prior to initiating 
QINLOCK and during treatment. 
Effects of QINLOCK on contraceptive steroids have not been studied. Add a barrier method if 
systemic steroids are used for contraception. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of ripretinib in pregnant women.  
Based on its mechanism of action, ripretinib is suspected to cause foetal harm when administered 
during pregnancy and animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). 
QINLOCK should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with ripretinib. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether ripretinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed child 
cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with QINLOCK and for 
at least 1 week after the final dose.  
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of ripretinib on human fertility. Based on findings from animal studies, 
male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with QINLOCK (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
QINLOCK has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In some patients, fatigue has 
been reported following administration of QINLOCK. If a patient experiences fatigue, this may 
influence their ability to drive or use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In the Phase 3 double-blind, randomised (2:1), placebo-controlled study (INVICTUS), 
129 participants with a diagnosis of advanced GIST who had failed at least 3 approved prior lines of 
treatment were randomised to QINLOCK (n=85) or placebo (n=44) (see section 5.1). In the Phase 1 
Study DCC-2618-01-001, a total of 277 patients with advanced malignancies were enrolled, and 
218 patients were treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose of 150 mg QINLOCK once daily.  
The median duration of treatment for QINLOCK in the double-blind period of the INVICTUS study 
was 5.49 months.

The most frequently observed adverse reactions (≥25%) in patients treated with QINLOCK in the 
pooled safety population (n=392) were fatigue (51.0%), alopecia (50.8%), nausea (39.8%), myalgia 
(37.8%), constipation (37.2%), diarrhoea (32.7%), PPES (29.8%), weight decreased (26.5%) and 
vomiting (25.8%). 
The adverse reactions (≥10 to <25%) observed in patients treated with QINLOCK in the pooled safety 
population (n=392) were lipase increased (23.7%), muscle spasms (23.7%), arthralgia (21.2%), 
headache (20.7%), dyspnoea (20.2%), hypertension (19.4%), dry skin (17.6%), back pain (15.6%), 
cough (15.6%), blood bilirubin increased (14.0%), oedema peripheral (13.8%), hypophosphataemia 
(12.2%), pain in extremity (12.0%), pruritus (11.0%) and seborrhoeic keratosis (11.0%).  
Grade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥2%) observed in patients treated with QINLOCK in the pooled safety 
population (n=392) were lipase increased (14.8%), anaemia (14.0%), abdominal pain (8.2%), 
hypertension (6.9%), fatigue (4.1%), hypophosphataemia (4.1%), vomiting (2.6%), dyspnoea (2.0%), 
diarrhoea (2.0%) and blood bilirubin increased (2.0%). Serious adverse reactions (≥1%) observed in 
patients treated with QINLOCK were anaemia (3.8%), dyspnoea (2.3%), vomiting (2.0%), nausea 
(1.8%), fatigue (1.5%), blood bilirubin increased (1.3%), constipation (1.0%), and muscular weakness 
(1.0%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The overall safety profile of QINLOCK is based on pooled data from 392 patients (pooled safety 
population) who received at least 1 dose of QINLOCK. Two clinical studies with QINLOCK in adult 
patients with advanced malignancies were conducted and form the primary basis of the overall 
evaluation of safety: a pivotal phase 3 study in adult patients with GIST, Study DCC-2618-03-001 
(INVICTUS) (see section 5.1) and an open-label, first-in-human study in adult patients with advanced 
malignancies (Study DCC-2618-01-001). 
The double-blind period of the INVICTUS study formed the primary basis of the determination of 
adverse reactions. The treatment emergent adverse events that were at least 5% higher in QINLOCK 
arm as compared to the placebo arm and those that were at least 1.5 times greater in the QINLOCK 
arm than those compared to placebo arm in INVICTUS were considered adverse drug reactions. 
Treatment emergent adverse events identified within the INVICTUS study were also evaluated across 
the pooled safety population (n=392). These events were considered adverse drug reactions per the 
Sponsor assessment. They are classified according to System Organ Class and the most appropriate 
MedDRA term is used to describe a certain reaction and its synonyms and related conditions.  
The severity of adverse drug reactions was assessed based on the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), defining Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe, Grade 
4=life threatening, and Grade 5=death. 
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 
to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from 
the available data) and are shown in Table 2. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse drug reactions  
Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES)  
In the double-blind period of the INVICTUS study, PPES was reported in 19 of 85 (22.4%) patients in 
the QINLOCK arm and no patients in the placebo arm. PPES led to dose discontinuation in 1.2% of 
patients, dose interruption in 3.5% of patients, and dose reduction in 2.4% of patients. All events were 
mild or moderate in severity (58% Grade 1 and 42% Grade 2).  
In the pooled safety population, PPES occurred in 29.8% of 392 patients, including Grade 3 adverse 
reactions in 0.5%. The median time to onset and duration of the first event was 8.1 weeks (range: 
0.3 week to 112.1 weeks) and 24.3 weeks (range: 0.9 week to 191.7 weeks), respectively. See 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 for additional information. 
Hypertension 
9 
 
 
 
 
In the double-blind period of the INVICTUS study, there was a higher incidence of hypertension (all 
events regardless of causality) in patients treated with QINLOCK (15.3%) vs. 4.7% of patients who 
received placebo.  
In the pooled safety population, hypertension occurred in 19.4% of 392 patients, including Grade 3 
adverse reactions in 6.9%. See sections 4.2 and 4.4 for additional information. 
Cardiac failure 
In the double-blind period of the INVICTUS study, cardiac failure (all events regardless of causality) 
occurred in 1.2% of the 85 patients who received QINLOCK. Cardiac failure led to dose 
discontinuation in 1.2% of the 85 patients who received QINLOCK. 
In the pooled safety population, cardiac failure occurred in 1.5% of 392 patients, including Grade 3 
adverse reactions in 1.0%. 
In the pooled safety population, 299 of 392 patients had a baseline and at least one post-baseline 
echocardiogram. Grade 3 decreased left ventricular ejection fraction occurred in 4.0% of the 
299 patients.  
See section 4.4 for additional information. 
Cutaneous malignancies  
In the double-blind period of the INVICTUS study, CuSCC (all events regardless of causality) was 
reported in 5.9% of the 85 patients receiving QINLOCK. CuSCC of the skin was not reported in 
placebo-treated patients. See sections 4.2 and 4.4 for additional information.  
In the pooled safety population, CuSCC occurred in 8.7% of 392 patients including Grade 3 adverse 
reactions in 0.5%.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no known specific antidote for overdose with QINLOCK.  
In the event of suspected overdose, QINLOCK must be discontinued immediately, best supportive 
care should be initiated by a medical professional, and the patient must be observed until clinical 
stabilisation.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
INVICTUS (DCC-2618-03-001 study)  
The efficacy and safety of QINLOCK were evaluated in a randomised (2:1), double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study (INVICTUS study) in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or 
metastatic GIST who had been previously treated with or are intolerant to at least 3 prior anticancer 
therapies including treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. Randomisation was stratified 
by prior lines of therapy (3 versus ≥4) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status (0 versus 1 or 2).  
The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) based on disease 
assessment by blinded independent central review (BICR) using modified RECIST 1.1 criteria, in 
which lymph nodes and bone lesions were not target lesions and a progressively growing new tumour 
nodule within a pre-existing tumour mass must meet specific criteria to be considered unequivocal 
evidence of progression. Secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) by 
BICR, overall survival (OS), and patient-reported health state, physical function (PF), and role 
function (RF). 
Participants were randomised to receive 150 mg QINLOCK (n=85) or placebo (n=44) orally once 
daily administered in continuous 28-day cycles. Treatment continued until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Individual treatment arms were unblinded at the time of disease progression as 
assessed by BICR review and all patients on placebo arm were offered to cross-over to QINLOCK.  
The demographic characteristics were median age of 60 years (29 to 83 years) with 79 (61.2%) of 
patients aged 18-64 years, 32 (24.8%) of patients aged 65-74 years, and 18 (13.9%) patients aged 
≥ 75 years (no patients ≥ 85 years old were randomised); male (56.6%); white (75.2%); and ECOG 
performance status of 0 (41.9%), 1 (49.6%), or 2 (8.5%). Sixty-three percent (63%) of patients 
received 3 prior therapies and approximately 37% received 4 or more prior therapies. Sixty-six percent 
(66%) of patients randomised to placebo crossed over to QINLOCK during the open-label period.  
At the primary analysis (data cut-off date 31 May 2019) QINLOCK was compared to placebo in the 
INVICTUS study. QINLOCK demonstrated benefit in all assessed patient subgroups for PFS. Median 
PFS as determined by BICR (months) (95% CI) was 6.3 (4.6, 6.9) for QINLOCK versus 1.0 (0.9, 1.7) 
for placebo, HR (95% CI) 0.15 (0.09, 0.25) p-value < 0.0001. The secondary endpoint ORR (%) was 
9.4 (4.2, 18) for QINLOCK versus 0 (0, 8) for placebo, p-value 0.0504 and not statistically significant. 
Median OS (months) (95% CI) was 15.1 (12.3, 15.1) for QINLOCK versus 6.6 (4.1, 11.6) for placebo, 
nominal p-value 0.0004. OS was not evaluated for statistical significance as a result of the sequential 
testing procedure for the secondary endpoints of ORR and OS.  
PFS, ORR and OS results from a more recent data cut-off (10 August 2020) are shown in Table 3 and 
Figures 1 and 2. PFS results were similar across subgroups based on age, sex, region, ECOG status 
and number of previous lines of therapy.

a Data cut off 10 August 2020 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
QINLOCK in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of GIST (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Ripretinib reaches peak plasma concentrations at a median of 4 hours after oral administration of 
single dose ripretinib 150 mg (given as three tablets each containing 50 mg). The mean (CV%) 
AUC0-∞ after a single dose of 150 mg of ripretinib was 9,856 (39%) and 8,146 (56%) ng•h/mL for 
ripretinib and DP-5439, respectively.  
Administration with a high-fat meal increased ripretinib AUC0-24 and Cmax by 30% and 22%, 
respectively. DP-5439 AUC0-24 and Cmax were higher by 47% and 66%, respectively.  
Distribution  
Both ripretinib and its active metabolite DP-5439 bind to plasma proteins at ≥ 99%. The mean (CV%) 
apparent volume of distribution (Vss/F) is approximately 302 (35%) L for ripretinib and 491 (38%) L 
for DP-5439.  
Biotransformation 
CYP3A4/5 is the major metaboliser of ripretinib and its active metabolite DP-5439, while CYP2C8 
and CYP2D6 are minor metabolisers. 
Elimination 
Following oral administration of single dose ripretinib 150 mg in humans, mean (CV%) apparent oral 
clearance (CL/F) was 15.2 (39%) and 17.9 (56%) L/hr for ripretinib and DP-5439, respectively. Mean 
(CV%) half-life (t½) was 12.6 (17%) and 15.6 (23%) hours for ripretinib and DP-5439, respectively. 
Systemic elimination of ripretinib was not primarily attributed to the kidney with 0.02% and 0.1% of 
the ripretinib dose excreted as ripretinib and DP-5439, respectively, in urine and 34% and 6% of the 
ripretinib dose excreted as ripretinib and DP-5439, respectively, in faeces.  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dose proportionality  
Across the dose range of 20-250 mg, ripretinib and DP-5439 PK appeared to be less than dose 
proportional, especially at ripretinib doses higher than 150 mg.  
Time dependency  
Steady-state conditions are achieved within 14 days.  
Specific populations 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of QINLOCK were observed based on 
age (19 to 87 years), sex, race (White, Black, and Asian), body weight (39 to 138 kg), and tumour 
(GIST or other solid tumours).  
Patients with renal impairment 
In clinical studies, no relevant differences in exposure were observed between patients with mild and 
moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault) and patients with 
normal renal function. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is 
recommended in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics and safety 
of QINLOCK in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min estimated by 
Cockcroft-Gault) is limited. No dosing recommendation can be made in patients with severe renal 
impairment (see section 4.2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
The effect of varying degrees of hepatic impairment as defined by Child-Pugh classification on the 
pharmacokinetics of ripretinib and DP-5439 was studied in a clinical trial (Study DCC-2618-01-004). 
In participants with mild hepatic impairment, there was no impact on the pharmacokinetics of 
ripretinib or DP-5439. In participants with moderate hepatic impairment, ripretinib AUC0-tlast was 
approximately 99% higher while Cmax was unchanged compared to matched healthy participants. The 
combined AUC0-tlast of ripretinib and DP-5439 was higher by approximately 51%. In participants with 
severe hepatic impairment, ripretinib AUC0-tlast was approximately 163% higher, Cmax was 
approximately 24% lower, and the combined AUC0-tlast of ripretinib and DP-5439 was approximately 
37% higher, compared to matched healthy participants. The observed magnitude of increase in 
ripretinib exposure is unlikely to be clinically relevant based on the known safety profile of ripretinib. 
Fraction of unbound ripretinib and DP-5439 was highly variable and no trend was apparent between 
protein binding and degree of hepatic impairment. 
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B), 
or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The preclinical safety profile of ripretinib was assessed in rats and dogs for up to 13 weeks duration. 
Inflammation responses correlated with skin changes (discoloured, lesions) were recorded in rats 
(approximately 1.12 times the human exposure at 150 mg once daily). Elevated hepatic enzyme 
activity was reported in both species (approximately 1.12 and 1.3 times the human exposure at 150 mg 
once daily for rats and dogs, respectively). Dogs presented gastrointestinal effects (emesis and/or 
abnormal faeces) (approximately 1.3 times the human exposure at 150 mg once daily), and 
inflammatory responses illustrated by adverse skin lesions (approximately 0.14 times the human 
exposure at 150 mg once daily). 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with ripretinib. 
Genotoxicity 
Ripretinib was found to be positive in an in vitro micronucleus assay. Ripretinib was not mutagenic in 
in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay nor in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay, 
demonstrating the absence of significant genotoxic risk. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Dedicated fertility studies in male and female animals were not conducted with ripretinib. However, in 
a 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study in male rats, there were findings of degeneration in the 
seminiferous epithelium of the testes, and cellular debris of the epididymis in males administered 30 or 
300 mg/kg/day but were considered of sufficient severity to affect reproduction at dose 300 mg/kg/day 
only (approximately 1.4 times the human exposure at 150 mg once daily). 
In a pivotal embryofoetal development study, ripretinib was teratogenic in rats, inducing dose-related 
malformations primarily associated with the visceral and skeletal systems at a maternal dose of 
20 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.0 times the human exposure at 150 mg once daily). Additionally, 
skeletal variations were already observed at 5 mg/kg/day. The developmental NOAEL for ripretinib 
was therefore established at 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.02 times the human exposure at 150 mg 
once daily). 
A study investigating effects of ripretinib on the pre-/postnatal development was not performed. 
Phototoxicity  
Ripretinib indicates a potential for photoirritation/phototoxicity based on absorption in the UV visible 
range (above 290 nm). In vitro phototoxicity assessment in 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells suggest that 
ripretinib exhibits a potential for phototoxicity at clinically relevant concentrations following exposure 
to UVA and UVB radiation.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What QINLOCK is and what it is used for 
QINLOCK is a cancer medicine containing the active substance ripretinib, a protein kinase inhibitor. 
Protein kinase inhibitors are used to treat cancer by stopping the activity of certain proteins that are 
involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. 
QINLOCK is used to treat adults with gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), a rare type of 
cancer of the digestive system including the stomach and bowel, that has: 
spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery 
- 
been treated with at least 3 previous cancer medicines, including imatinib. 
- 
If you have any questions about how QINLOCK works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, please ask your doctor. 
2.  What you need to know before you take QINLOCK 
Do not take QINLOCK if you are allergic to ripretinib or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Before taking QINLOCK, talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have or have a history of: 
- 
high blood pressure. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure prior to and during treatment 
with QINLOCK and may give you a medicine to treat high blood pressure, if needed.  
- 
heart conditions. Your doctor may perform additional tests to assess how your heart functions 
prior to and during your treatment with QINLOCK. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
liver or kidney problems. 
When taking QINLOCK, talk to your doctor or pharmacist if: 
- 
you notice redness, pain, swelling, or blisters on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet. 
This is a skin problem called palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES). Your doctor 
may continue your treatment, change your dose or stop your treatment until your condition 
improves (see section 4). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you notice unexpected skin changes such as a new wart, open sore or reddish bump that bleeds 
or does not heal, or a change in size or colour of a mole. QINLOCK may increase the risk of 
some types of skin cancers (see section 4). Your doctor will check your skin when starting 
treatment with QINLOCK and routinely during treatment. It is important that you check your 
skin regularly. 
you have wounds from any recent surgery that aren’t healing as expected. QINLOCK may 
affect the way wounds heal. Your doctor may decide to temporarily stop treatment with 
QINLOCK a few days before surgery and until your wound has healed after surgery. Your 
doctor will decide when to start QINLOCK again. It is important that you tell your doctor if you 
have any planned surgeries in the future. 
you feel tired, short of breath, notice protruding veins in your neck, or have swelling of the 
abdomen, ankles or lower legs while taking QINLOCK, these may be symptoms of heart failure 
(see section 4).  
your skin or eyes become more sensitive to sunlight or other forms of light. Do not expose 
yourself to direct sunlight, sunlamps and other sources of ultraviolet radiation when taking this 
medicine. You should wear protective clothing, and apply sun cream with high sun protection 
factor when you are exposed to strong sunlight. 
Important information for men and women about contraception 
QINLOCK can cause harm to your unborn baby. Do not become pregnant while taking QINLOCK. 
Use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 week after the final dose of QINLOCK 
if you are a female of childbearing potential or a male with a female partner of childbearing potential. 
If using hormonal contraception, add a barrier contraception (such as condoms). See section on 
‘Contraception, pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility’. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years of age because it has not been 
studied in this age group.  
Other medicines and QINLOCK 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
QINLOCK can affect the way some medicines work. Also, some medicines can affect the way 
QINLOCK works.  
In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines:  
- 
medicines used to treat fungal infections (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, 
voriconazole)  
medicines used to treat bacterial infections (such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin)  
medicines used to treat HIV (such as ritonavir, efavirenz, etravirine) 
medicines used for epilepsy or fits (such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital)

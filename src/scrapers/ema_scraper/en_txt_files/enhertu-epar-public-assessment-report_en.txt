2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for trastuzumab deruxtecan is monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients 
with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-
HER2-based regimens.

2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed female cancer worldwide (11.6% of all cancer sites) 
and the leading cause of cancer death in women (6.6% of all cancer deaths in 2018). Breast cancer is 
mainly a female disease with only 1% of cases occurring in males worldwide and it occurs more 
frequently in women over 40 years of age. According to GLOBOCAN 2018 data, 67% of patients with 
breast cancer are diagnosed between the ages of 45 years and 74 years, with 43% of patients 
diagnosed between the ages of 55 years and 74 years. In 2018, there were an estimated 1,410,831 
women living with breast cancer in the EU-27 who were diagnosed in the last 5 years, corresponding to 
a 5-year prevalence rate of 623.6 per 100,000. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Approximately 20% of patients with breast cancer have HER2-positive tumours and HER2 positivity is 
associated with a more aggressive disease and a younger patient population. Although treatment with 
anti-HER2 targeted therapies has improved the disease outcomes, these are not curative in the locally 
advanced/metastatic setting and the disease invariably progresses. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
The diagnosis of breast cancer is based on clinical examination in combination with imaging and 
confirmed by pathological assessment. Disease stage should be assessed according to the AJCC TNM 
staging system. HER2 testing should be carried out according to the American Society of Clinical 
Oncology–College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines (Cardoso et al., 20191). HER2 is 
defined as positive by IHC (3+) when more than 10% of the cells harbor a complete membrane 
staining, and by ISH if the number of HER2 gene copies is ≥6, or the HER2/chromosome 17 (CEP17) 
ratio is ≥2 and HER2 copies ≥4, or HER2/CEP17 <2 and HER2 copies ≥6 (Wolff et al., 20182). 
The signs of more advanced locoregional disease include axillary adenopathy (suggesting locoregional 
disease) or skin findings such as erythema, thickening, or dimpling of the overlying skin (peau 
d’orange), suggesting inflammatory breast cancer. Symptoms of metastatic breast cancer depend on 
the organs involved, with the most common sites of involvement being the bone (e.g., back or leg 
pain), liver (abdominal pain, nausea, jaundice), and lungs (e.g., shortness of breath or cough). 
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease. Although treatment with anti-
HER2 therapies has improved the disease outcomes for patients with unresectable or metastatic breast 
cancer, the disease invariably progresses. Especially, the incidence of brain metastases, for which 
effective treatment options are limited, has increased such that brain metastases may develop in up to 
half of patients. The estimated median OS of metastatic breast cancer is about 3 years and the 5-year 
survival rate is only 
25% (Cardoso et al., 20183).

Several anti-HER2 therapies have been approved in the EU for the treatment of HER2-positive breast 
cancer. The first approved anti-HER2 therapy was trastuzumab, and other HER2-targeting agents now 
approved include the HER2-targeting ADC trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) as monotherapy for 
patients previously received trastuzumab and a taxane separately or in combination; the tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI) neratinib as monotherapy in early-stage breast cancer; and the mAb pertuzumab 
and the TKI lapatinib in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.   
The current SoC for newly-diagnosed metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in Europe, according to 
guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), is a combination of pertuzumab, 
trastuzumab, and taxane based on results from the CLEOPATRA study, followed by treatment with 
single-agent TDM1 as established by the EMILIA study. In the CLEOPATRA study, newly-diagnosed 
patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive trastuzumab plus 
docetaxel with or without the addition of pertuzumab as first-line therapy. The addition of pertuzumab 
improved the median PFS from 12.4 months to 18.5 months and the median overall survival (OS) from 
40.8 months to 56.5 months. In the EMILIA study, TDM1 was compared to combined therapy with 
lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients, who had progressed after treatment with the trastuzumab plus 
taxane combination, which resulted in improved outcomes compared to treatment with lapatinib plus 
capecitabine, with an ORR of 43.6% (95%CI: 38.6, 48.6) in the TDM1 arm vs. 30.8% (95%CI: 26.3, 
35.7) in the lapatinib plus capecitabine arm; a median PFS of 9.6 months vs. 6.4 months (HR 0.65 
[95%CI: 0.55, 0.77]), respectively; and a median OS of 30.9 months vs. 25.1 months (HR 0.68 
[95%CI: 0.55, 0.85]), respectively.   
Treatment options for HER2-positive MBC after 2 or more anti-HER2 based regimens 
It is agreed that there is no clearly defined SoC for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast 
cancer after 2 or more anti-HER2-based regimens, which is the proposed setting for trastuzumab 
deruxtecan. Moreover, some of the approved regimens have moved to the setting of early breast 
cancer, such as TDM1 and pertuzumab.  
Treatment options licensed in the European Union in this setting include lapatinib + capecitabine, 
trastuzumab + capecitabine, trastuzumab + lapatinib, or trastuzumab + other agents. The most 
recently published clinical studies in subjects with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had 
received ≥2 prior lines of anti-HER2 therapy are the NALA, SOPHIA, and HER2CLIMB studies, which 
have sought to establish SoC regimens. The reference arms of these studies represent the most recent 
data for subjects receiving the current European SoC in the target population. In the NALA study, the 
reference therapy was lapatinib + capecitabine; in the SOPHIA study, the reference therapy 
trastuzumab + chemotherapy; and in the HER2CLIMB study, the reference therapy was placebo + 
trastuzumab + capecitabine. The results of these studies are provided in Table 1.

ORR by ICR was 61.4% (95%CI: 54.0, 68.5), with a duration of response (DoR) of 20.8 months 
(95%CI: 15.0, NE). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 19.4 months (95%CI: 14.1, NE), 
and the median overall survival (OS) was 24.6 months (95%CI: 23.1, NE). Thus, trastuzumab 
deruxtecan offers clinically meaningful benefit compared with the current SOCs. The median PFS for 
trastuzumab deruxtecan of 19.4 months is higher than the reported median PFS for the reference 
therapies used in the NALA, SOPHIA or HER2CLIMB studies (≤5.6 months); indeed, the lower bound of 
the trastuzumab deruxtecan 95%CI for the PFS of 14.1 months is higher than the reported upper 
bound for PFS from the reference arms of the NALA, SOPHIA, and HER2CLIMB studies (which were all 
below ≤7.1 months). Hence, trastuzumab deruxtecan is considered to offer clinically meaningful 
benefit compared with the investigational therapies used in the NALA, SOPHIA, and HER2CLIMB 
studies, where the median PFS was≤7.8 months, and the upper bound of the 95%CI was 9.6 months. 
Unmet Medical Need in the Proposed Indication 
Metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer remains an uncurable disease. Although treatment with anti-
HER2-based regimens has improved the disease outcomes for patients with unresectable locally-
advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, the disease invariably progresses. Efficacy 
outcomes from current treatments approved in the EU for previously treated patients with HER2-
positive metastatic breast cancer summarized by the Applicant show that the ORRs for available 
treatments range from 16-26.7% and a duration of response of approximately 6 months and PFS in 
the range between 4.9-5.6 months for licensed therapies.  The lack of clearly preferential and effective 
treatment options after 2 or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens for HER2-positive metastatic breast 
cancer, as reflected by the absence of guideline-specific recommendations and low reported ORRs, 
highlights the remaining unmet medical need for these patients and the continued need for new HER2-
targeted agents in this particular setting.

About the product 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan exhibits HER2 specific antitumor activity via a mechanism of action that 
combines Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a HER2 targeted antibody and topoisomerase I inhibitor 
conjugate, a so-called antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The anti-HER2 component, MAAL 9001, is a 
humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has the same amino acid 
sequence as trastuzumab and thus, trastuzumab deruxtecan is similarly targeted to HER2 expressing 
tumours. The released drug, MAAA-1181a, is a topoisomerase I inhibitor derivative of exatecan. The 
mAb is covalently conjugated to a drug-linker, MAAA 1162a, that is composed of a cleavable maleimide 
tetrapeptide linker and the released drug. The tetrapeptide linker is designed to be stable in plasma to 
reduce systemic exposure to the released drug. After cell internalization, the released drug leads to 
apoptosis of the target tumour cells via the inhibition of topoisomerase I. The released drug is cell-
membrane permeable, giving the ability to penetrate and act in surrounding cells.  
The claimed and approved indication for trastuzumab deruxtecan is as monotherapy for the treatment 
of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or 
more prior anti HER2 based regimens. 
The recommended dose of Enhertu is 5.4 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks 
(21 day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The initial dose should be 
administered as a 90 minute intravenous infusion. If the prior infusion was well tolerated, subsequent 
doses of Enhertu may be administered as 30 minute infusions. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The Applicant’s summary of the efficacy of existing therapies. 
It is agreed that there still exists a high unmet medical need for the patient population, who 
have received two prior lines of anti-HER2 treatment-based regimens.  
It is agreed that there is no clear SOC in the targeted setting after two prior lines of anti-HER2 
treatment-based regimens. The efficacy results with the treatments currently used in the 
proposed setting show response rates (ORR) from 9-41% and duration of response (DOR) and 
PFS in the range of 3.3 to 7.8 months, so there exists an unmet medical need for better 
treatments in the targeted setting. 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan demonstrated antitumor activity with confirmed objective response 
rate (ORR) of 60.9% (95% CI: 53.4, 68.0) in Study U201, with median duration of response 
(DoR) at 14.8 months (95% CI: 13.8, 16.9). 
The strength of evidence presented is deemed sufficient for an accelerated assessment of an 
application of a CMA, since the efficacy and safety data have been updated since the primary 
analysis and there are efficacy data for 235 patients from a single-arm trial, who have received 
the proposed dose with relevant and acceptable exposure.  
The safety database comprises 234 patients, which is also considered acceptable for a CMA. 
The Applicant has several randomised comparative studies ongoing, of which the 301 study is 
considered to be able to provide relevant confirmatory efficacy and safety data within a 
reasonable timeframe.

• 
In conclusion, an accelerated assessment of the application for trastuzumab deruxtecan would 
be of major interest from the point of view of public health, because the ORR and DOR results 
show therapeutic advantage compared to available treatments. 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) 726/2004, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. 
The Applicant has an ongoing Phase 3 randomized controlled study, which data can serve as 
confirmatory: DESTINY Breast02 (Study U301) assesses the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan vs. investigator's choice of treatment (trastuzumab plus capecitabine or lapatinib 
plus capecitabine) in patients, whose disease progressed on T-DM1 (i.e. 3L). A total of 600 
patients are planned to be enrolled, 329 randomized as of 13 March 2020. This study is 
relevant for the claimed target population and provides data on PFS (primary endpoint) and OS 
(key secondary endpoint). Enrolment is expected to be complete in February 2021 and 
progression-free survival data are currently projected to be available during the first quarter of 
2022 and could be considered as comprehensive data as a specific obligation (SOB) in the 
context of a CMA. It is considered likely that granting of a CMA will not impact the enrolment of 
the phase 3 study. A total of 329 out of 600 subjects planned were enrolled as of 13 Mar 2020, 
therefore 82 new patients were enrolled within a period of about 3 months. Therefore, the 
planning for the last subject to be enrolled (Feb 2021) is considered reasonable. It is expected 
that granting of a CMA will not impact the enrolment of the phase 3 study U301. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as there is no clearly defined SoC and reported ORRs of 
therapeutic regimens administered after 2 or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens range 
approximately from 9% to 41%, while trastuzumab deruxtecan showed a confirmed ORR of 
60.9% (95% CI: 53.4, 68.0) in Study U201 with DoR of 14.8 months (95% CI: 13.8, 16.9). 
Additionally, the median PFS with currently available treatment options is in the range of 3.3 to 
7.8 months and a need for better treatments exist that prolong PFS and ultimately OS. ORR and 
DoR are substantially higher/longer for trastuzumab deruxtecan than reported for other medicinal 
products in the target population with at least two prior lines of anti-HER2 treatment. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan shows substantial antitumor activity with a clinically meaningful ORR 
and durability of response, representing a clinically significant improvement over available 
therapies. Trastuzumab deruxtecan was generally tolerable and its safety profile was generally 
manageable through dose modifications and standard clinical practice. As such, trastuzumab 
deruxtecan addresses the unmet medical need and the immediate accessibility of patients to 
trastuzumab deruxtecan will provide a benefit to public health that outweighs the inherent risks 
associated with the limited availability of long-term safety and efficacy data. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Enhertu  is  an  antibody-drug  conjugate  (ADC)  presented  as  a  powder  for  concentrate  for  solution  for 
infusion in a vial containing 100 mg of trastuzumab deruxtecan as active substance. Enhertu is provided 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 15/210 
 
 
 
in a 10 mL Type 1 amber borosilicate glass vial sealed with a fluoro-resin laminated butyl rubber stopper, 
and a polypropylene/aluminium yellow flip off crimp cap. 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is formulated with L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sucrose 
and polysorbate 80.    
Prior to use, the powder is reconstituted with water for injections. The reconstituted solution is sterile 
and intended for single use only. It is then diluted in an infusion bag using 5% glucose solution before 
dosing via intravenous infusion.  
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that contains trastuzumab, a humanised 
anti HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, covalently linked 
to a topoisomerase I inhibitor via a linker. Approximately 8 molecules of deruxtecan are attached to 
each antibody molecule. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan active substance, also referred to as DS-8201a, results from the conjugation 
of the following intermediates: 
- Trastuzumab monoclonal antibody (MAAL-9001); 
- A drug-linker (MAAA-1162a) comprised of a Topoisomerase I inhibitor derivative of exatecan (MAAA-
1181a) and a tetrapeptide based cleavable linker (MFAH).  
MAAL-9001 is covalently conjugated to approximately 8 molecules of MAAA-1162a. The linker is designed 
to  be  stable  in  plasma  to  reduce  systemic  exposure  to  the  released  MAAA-1181a  drug.  After  cell 
internalisation,  the  released  MAAA-1181a  drug  leads  to  apoptosis  of  the  target  tumour  cells  via  the 
inhibition of topoisomerase I. The released MAAA-1181a drug is cell-membrane permeable, giving the 
ability to penetrate and act in surrounding cells. The effect of the ADC derives primarily from the released 
MAAA-1181a drug and to a lesser extent to the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) effector 
function of the conjugated antibody. 
The quality of MAAL-9001 antibody, MAAA-1162a drug-linker and the conjugated antibody is described 
in  separate  sections.  The  structures  of  DS-8201a,  MAAA-1162a,  MAAA-1181a,  and  MAAL-9001  are 
provided in Figure 1.

2.2. Trastuzumab intermediate (MAAL-9001) 
General information 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 19/210 
 
 
 
 
MAAL-9001 is a full-length IgG1κ isotype antibody with relative molecular mass of approximately 145 
kDa without accounting for glycans (glycosylation site at Asn300). MAAL-9001 consists of two identical 
heavy  chains  and  light  chains  composed  of  450  and  214  amino  acids,  respectively.  The  amino  acid 
sequence  of  MAAL-9001,  deduced  from  its  cDNA  sequence,  is  the  same  as  the  one  of  trastuzumab 
contained in centrally authorised products (e.g. Herceptin (EMEA/H/C/000278)). The inter-chain disulfide 
bonds  are  identified  between  heavy  chains  at  Cys229  and  Cys232,  and  between  Cys214  on  the  light 
chain and Cys223 on heavy chain. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls  
The manufacturing site for MAAL-9001 is provided. A valid GMP certificate has been provided. Valid GMP 
certificates  are  also  provided  for  the  sites  performing  WCB  and  MCB  storage  as  well  as  for  the  site 
performing mycoplasma and adventitious virus testing.   
The  MAAL-9001  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  monoclonal  antibody  manufacturing  process.  It 
consists of a cell culture process (upstream) and a protein purification process (downstream).  
The cell culture process involves the propagation of recombinant CHO cells expressing the MAAL-9001 
protein from one WCB vial through inoculation of flasks and bioreactors of gradually increasing size up 
to the final batch production bioreactor. The MAAL-9001 antibodies are harvested and is purified using 
a series of chromatography steps (, viral inactivation (ultrafiltration/diafiltration and viral filtration steps. 
The manufacturing process is well described.  
The  General  Process  Parameters  (GPP),  Key  Process  Parameters  (KPP)  and  CPPs  are  defined  by  the 
Applicant for each manufacturing stage and listed with their PARs: 
- GPP: A process parameter whose variability impacts neither a Key Process Attribute (KPA) (a measure 
that represents consistency of process performance) nor a Critical Quality Attribute (CQA). 
- KPP: A process parameter whose variability has an impact on a KPA but not on a CQA. 
- CPP: A process parameter whose variability has an impact on a CQA when falling outside the operational 
range. 
Acceptable  hold  times  are  applied  for  the  cell  culture  process  and  for  the  purification  process, 
respectively. 
Control of materials 
The raw materials are listed with appropriate specifications. The TSE risk is considered sufficiently low. 
The source, history and generation of the cell substrate has been described in sufficient detail.  
The  host  cell  line  for  expressing  MAAL-9001  was  generated  using  the  CHO-S  system.  MAAL-9001  is 
manufactured from CHO-derived cell substrates employing a two-tiered system consisting of Master Cell 
Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB). The MCB is extensively tested in accordance with ICH Q5A 
and ICH Q5D guidelines making the proposed reduced virus testing programme for WCBs acceptable.  
A protocol is presented for generation of future cell banks and is acceptable. The stability and lack of 
contamination of the production cell line has been documented beyond the culturing period.  
Control of Critical steps and intermediates 
A summary of the CPPs, KPPS and IPCs is given in the dossier and these are found acceptable. IPCs have 
been defined for each step of the active substance manufacturing process  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 20/210 
 
 
 
The IPC methods have been suitably described. Method validation has been provided for non-compendial 
IPC methods and method suitability has been adequately verified for compendial methods.  
Process validation 
Process evaluation 
The  approach  to  process  evaluation  was  based  on  extensive  process  development  studies,  prior 
manufacturing experience and process risk assessments.  
The Applicant sufficiently summarised the results of the design of experiments (DOE) studies and also 
provided  a  rationale  as  to  the  potential  impact  of  process  parameters  (and  interactions)  on  quality 
attributes.  The  results  from  these  studies  are  supportive  of  a  well-characterised  process  and  the 
approach to setting of PARs is found acceptable. 
Process verification 
The process validation strategy included process verification (also referred to as PPQ) runs. The results 
from  the  PPQ  batches  are  consistent  and  support  a  conclusion  that  the  process  is  robust  and  well 
controlled.  
Shipping of the MAAL-9001 has been qualified.  
Manufacturing process development  
The manufacturing process development is adequately described.  
Characterisation  
Elucidation of structure 
MAAL-9001 has been thoroughly characterised. The predicted primary amino acid sequences of MAAL-
9001 heavy chains and light chains have been verified.  
Post-translational  modifications,  glycosylation,  charge  and  size  heterogeneity,  secondary  structure, 
binding activity have been were suitably investigated. 
 The Applicant included further biological characterisation of MAAL-9001 in the trastuzumab deruxtecan 
section (see below).  
Impurities 
Product-related impurities 
Product related impurities such as HMWS, including dimer and higher order aggregates, and LMWS were 
investigated and are controlled to acceptable levels. 
Product-related substances 
Product-related substances, such as major acidic and basic variants found in MAAL-9001. are suitably 
controlled to acceptable levels. 
Process-related impurities  
It is considered demonstrated that process-related impurities are well-controlled and pose no safety risk.  
Furthermore,  a  risk  assessment  of  extractables  and  leachables  from  materials  used  during  the 
manufacture of MAAL-9001 has been conducted. 
CHMP assessment report

Specification 
The specification for MAAL-9001 performed at release and for stability assessment includes control of 
identity, purity and impurities, potency and other general tests. 
Overall,  the  parameters  included  in  the  MAAL-9001  specifications  are  found  adequate  to  control  the 
quality of the MAAL-9001. The acceptance criteria for the MAAL-9001 specification parameters are found 
appropriate.  
Analytical methods 
The  analytical  procedures  are  described  in  sufficient  details.  System  suitability  criteria  are  specified 
where relevant and the acceptance criteria have been confirmed during validation of the methods. The 
Applicant provided validation reports for the non-compendial methods. In general, the non-compendial 
methods have been validated in line with ICH Q2, and it has been clarified that suitability of the methods 
has  been  adequately  demonstrated.  The  suitability  of  the  test  for  bioburden  and  test  for  endotoxin 
performed according to Ph. Eur. have been demonstrated.  
Batch analysis 
Data  for  all  batches  show  that  data  is  comparable  across  production  scales.  All  batches  met  the 
acceptance criteria. 
Reference standard 
A  standard  approach  with  two  tier  reference  standards  is  in  place.  Primary  reference  standard  and 
secondary reference standard are established and have been qualified.  
The Applicant has provided the history of the previous MAAL-9001 reference standards and documented 
the link between the current reference standard and the initial material used for toxicology and clinical 
studies, including detailed information on the qualification and assessment against the primary reference 
standard  of  the  secondary  reference  standard.  Information  on  the  generation  and  storage  of  future 
primary  and  secondary  reference  standards  is  given by  referring to  the  description  of  the  procedures 
used for the preparation of the current primary and secondary reference standards. 
Container closure  
The MAAL-9001 bulk is filled into bags. The inner fluid contact layer is stated to be compliant with Ph. 
Eur. 3.1.7 Ethyl vinyl acetate copolymer for containers and tubing for parenteral nutrition preparations.  
The choice of packaging material for the active substance is considered appropriate.  
Stability 
The shelf life proposed for MAAL-9001 stored in the container closure system is considered supported by 
the  stability  data.  These  primary/registration  lots  are  considered  as  representative  of  the  MAAL-9001 
commercial process. 
2.3. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) 
General information 
The active substance trastuzumab deruxtecan, also referred to as DS-8201a, is an ADC comprised of 
MAAL-9001 antibody conjugated to the drug-linker MAAA-1162a. There are 4 interchain disulfide bonds 
that  can  be  reduced  to  produce  cysteine  residues  which  then  can  react  with  MAAA-1162a  to  form 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 22/210 
 
 
 
thioether bonds and produce the ADC DS-8201a. The target number of drug-linker coupled to 1 antibody 
molecule is 8. The drug which is released is the MAAA-1181a moiety. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The conjugation of the MAAL-9001 and drug-linker occurs at the Daiichi Sankyo Chemical Pharma Co., 
Ltd.  (DSCP),  Onahama  site  in  Japan.  During  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process,  the  MAAL-
9001  antibody  is  conjugated  with  the  MAAA-1162a  drug-linker.  MAAA-1162a  and  MAAL-9001  are 
categorised as active substance intermediates. 
The DS-8201a manufacturing process consists of MAAL-9001 thawing) followed by reduction. Reduced 
MAAL-9001 is incubated with MAAA-1162a for conjugation. After conjugation, the crude MAAA-1162a is 
purified, and the composition is adjusted to the final formulation. The composition adjusted solution is 
then  filtered  into  separate  bags  and  frozen  for  storage  and  shipment.  The  manufacturing  process  is 
adequately described. 
Control of materials 
Appropriate specifications are presented for non-compendial materials.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The IPCs defined for the control strategy are found to be acceptable. 
Process validation 
Process evaluation 
Process evaluation involved the initial identification of CQAs through an evaluation of the Quality Target 
Product  Profile  (QTPP)  and  CQAs  of  the  finished  product.  This  was  followed  by  a  preliminary  hazard 
analysis  and  a  risk  assessment  to  identify  areas  of  focus  and  potential  CPPs  with  impact  on  CQAs, 
respectively. Potential CPPs, classified as high risk, were evaluated through process evaluation studies 
to  determine  if  they  had  a  critical  impact  on  the  relevant  CQAs.  The  control  strategy  is  considered 
acceptable. 
Process verification 
The commercial manufacturing process was successfully validated. The process validation batches met 
the validation acceptance criteria supporting that the process is in a valid state.  
Shipping qualification studies were performed and verified that the product-temperature is maintained 
for the duration of shipping. 
Manufacturing process development  
Overall,  the  results  of  the  comparability  studies  support  that the  quality  of  DS-8201a  throughout  the 
product  and  process  development  has  been  comparable  from  the  early  development  non-clinical  and 
clinical trials, to the pivotal trial and to the commercial product. 
Characterisation  
Elucidation of structure 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a active substance) has been thoroughly characterised.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 23/210 
 
 
 
The  primary  structure  of  DS-8201a  active  substance  and  the  drug-linker  conjugation  sites  were 
confirmed by a peptide mapping technique.   
The secondary structure was verified by confirmation of the expected disulphide bond configuration of 
the IgG1 subclass antibody by peptide mapping under non-reducing conditions. 
The charge heterogeneity of DS-8201a was evaluated by cation exchange chromatography (CEX-HPLC), 
imaged capillary isoelectric focusing (icIEF) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE).  
The size heterogeneity of DS-8201a active substance was investigated and it was found that DS-8201a 
is predominantly a monomer in solution with trace amounts of HMWS and LMWS.  
The distribution profile of drug-linker on DS-8201a active substance was characterised by 3 methods: 
RP-HPLC, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HI-HPLC) and non-reduced CE-SDS (nrCE-SDS). The 
average DAR of DS-8201a active substance was determined by RP-HPLC and HI-HPLC to be 7.8.  
The secondary structure was elucidated using far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The tertiary 
structure was elucidated using near UV CD spectroscopy. The folding state of the conjugated MAAL-9001 
was  deduced  from  its  thermal  stability  using  Differential  Scanning  Calorimetry  (DSC)  and  the  results 
indicate that the tertiary structure of the MAAL-9001 is maintained through the drug-linker conjugation 
process. 
Biological characterisation 
The biological characterisation is found comprehensive and support the putative mechanism of action 
(MoA). The major MoA of the DS-8201a active substance is antitumor activity through HER2 binding and 
cytotoxic activity of the conjugated drug MAAA-1162a, which is cleaved and the MAAA-1181a released 
after internalization and leads to apoptosis of the target tumour cells via the inhibition of topoisomerase 
I. The DS-8201a active substance has the same amino acid sequences as trastuzumab, which targets 
HER-expressing tumour cells. DS-8201a active substance exhibits ADCC activity and HER2-mediated Akt 
phosphorylation inhibition, but no complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).  
Overall the binding activity studies demonstrate that the DS-8201a active substance, after undergoing 
the conjugation process that attaches the drug-linker, retains most of the structural features of MAAL-
9001. 
Impurities  
Product-related impurities 
HMWS, LMWS and unconjugated DS-8201a active substance are considered product-related impurities. 
HMWS  
HMWS and LMWS are present in MAAL-9001 and are carried over to DS-8201a active substance.  
Product-related substances 
The charge variants of DS-8201a active substance are classified as product-related substances. The APG 
and BPG in MAAL-9001 are carried over to the DS-8201a active substance.  
Process-related impurities   
The process-related impurities are tested according to the specifications and are considered sufficiently 
controlled.  
Extractables/Leachables  
A risk assessment for the single-use polymeric components used in the manufacture and storage of the 
active substance was conducted. The results demonstrate that single-use polymeric components used in 
CHMP assessment report

of the methods has been adequately demonstrated. The suitability of the test for bioburden and test for 
endotoxin performed according to Ph. Eur. have been demonstrated. 
Batch analysis 
Data for DS-8201a batches manufactured through clinical development and for the commercial product 
have been provided.  
Data for all batches show that data is comparable across production scales and sites. All batches met 
the acceptance criteria. 
Reference standard 
A standard approach with two tier reference standards is in place. A primary reference standard and a 
secondary  reference  standard  is  established  and  has  been  qualified.  Qualification  included  DS-8201a 
active substance release methods as well as additional characterisation.  
The  Applicant  has  provided  the  history  of  the  previous  DS-8201a  reference  standards  and  has

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
Description of the finished product 
Trastuzumab  deruxtecan  100  mg  finished  product  is  a  sterile  lyophilised  powder  for  concentrate  for 
solution for infusion, supplied as single-use vials. Each carton contains 1 vial. 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is formulated with well-known compendial excipients: sucrose, L-Histidine, L-
Histidine hydrochloride monohydrate and polysorbate 80.  
Prior to use, the finished product is reconstituted with 5 mL of water for injections to provide a solution 
with a concentration of 20 mg/mL trastuzumab deruxtecan, in 25mM histidine buffer that includes 90 
mg/mL  sucrose  and  0.03%  (w/v)  of  polysorbate  80  at  pH  5.5.  The  reconstituted  solution  is  a  sterile 
solution  and  is  then  diluted  in  an  infusion  bag  containing  5%  dextrose  (glucose)  for  dosing  via 
intravenous infusion.  
The primary container closure system is a Type 1 amber borosilicate glass vial sealed with a fluoro-resin 
laminated butyl rubber stopper, and a polypropylene/aluminium yellow flip off crimp cap.  
There are no overages. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The  formulation  development  was  guided  by  the  QTPP  and  based  on  prior  knowledge  regarding  the 
stabilisation  of  lyophilised  monoclonal  antibodies  and  antibody-drug  conjugate  products.  CQAs  were 
identified based on the QTPP. The rationale for the identified CQAs has been provided. The rationale for 
assigning  the  parameters  as  CQAs  is  based  on  the  influence  of  the  individual  CQA  on  safety  and/or 
efficacy and stability of the finished product.  
The formulation development has been thoroughly described and the rationale for the selection of the 
formulation  has  been  adequately  addressed  and  justified.  The  manufacturing  process  development  is 
described in detail and found to be comprehensive. 
A comprehensive set of studies is presented for each step in the manufacturing process. The knowledge 
gained  during  process  development  studies  was  used  to  develop  the  control  strategy  Overall  the 
approach taken for the control strategy is considered acceptable.  A summary of the critical IPCs has 
been provided. The definition of the approach to non-conformances for IPCs is acceptable.  
DS-8201a is light-sensitive and an amber vial was selected for the container of the finished product in 
order to prevent light-induced photo-degradation. No incompatibility between the amber vials and the 
finished product was observed. The selection of the amber glass vial as a control measure to minimise 
photo-degradation is supported by the registration stability studies. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 26/210 
 
 
 
The integrity of the container closure system to prevent microbial contamination has been adequately 
examined. Further, the sterility of the finished product is assured by the validated aseptic manufacturing 
process. 
An  IV  compatibility  study  was  conducted  using  a  representative  range  of  administration  materials 
including commonly used in-line filters. In addition to the physical and chemical compatibility study, an 
in-use study to assess the sterility maintenance and a microbial challenge penetration study was also 
conducted. It is agreed that these studies support storage at 2°C to 8°C for no more than 24 hours for 
reconstituted and diluted product as stated in the SmPC.  
Overall, the pharmaceutical development of the finished product is described in sufficient details and is 
acceptable. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture  
Trastuzumab  deruxtecan  (DS-8201a)  finished  product  is  manufactured,  tested,  stored,  labelled  and 
packaged in accordance with EU GMP.  
The manufacturing process includes active substance thawing and compounding, sterile filtration, aseptic 
filling,  lyophilisation  and  capping.    The  pooled,  fully  formulated  finished  product  solution  is  sterilised 
using sterile filters. For the lyophilisation process, the freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying 
steps  are  performed  consecutively.  The  manufacturing  process  does  not  include  any  isolated  process 
intermediates.  
Throughout the manufacturing process, measures are taken to protect DS-8201a from light exposure, 
since it is a critical parameter for the purity of the active substance. The microbial quality is assessed 
during  finished  product  manufacturing  by  IPC  testing  for  bacterial  endotoxins  (compounding  step), 
bioburden  (prior  to  sterile  filtration)  and  filter  integrity  (post  filtration).    Filter  integrity  testing  is 
performed  pre-  as  well  as  post-filtration.  In  addition  to  the  IPCs  related  to  microbial  control,  the  fill 
volume is part of the routine IPCs for each batch.  Processing and hold times limits for the manufacture 
of finished product has been provided in the detailed description of the manufacturing process.  
The manufacturing process is well described and considered acceptable. Flow charts of the manufacturing 
process steps, including IPCs have been provided and a narrative description of each step is given. The 
IPCs and CPPs are considered acceptable and sufficient to ensure the quality and consistency of each 
manufacturing step. 
Process validation 
Process validation (PPQ) was performed and three PPQ batches were manufactured.  
All the PPQ tests met the acceptance criteria and it is agreed that the validated process is reproducible, 
consistent, and under control.  
Sterilisation and depyrogenation of the filling equipment and components used in the finished product 
manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  and  are  re-qualified  periodically.  The  equipment  used  for 
sterilisation and depyrogenation of the filling equipment and container closure components of finished 
product were qualified. The sterilisation-in-place (SIP) of the lyophiliser was validated with all acceptance 
criteria being met. 
Routine  revalidation  of  media  fills  for  all  vial  formats,  interventions  and  challenging  conditions  were 
covered.  For  confirmation  of  the  container  closure  system  used  for  commercial  manufacturing  of  the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 27/210 
 
 
 
finished  product,  additional  product-specific  media  fills  were  conducted.  As  a  result,  the  aseptic 
procedure for the manufacturing of the finished product was qualified. 
Filter validation has been performed, demonstrating the consistent B. diminuta retention capability of 
the sterilising-grade filter.  
To  ensure  finished  product  quality,  a  study  was  performed  focusing  on  leachables  coming  from  the 
manufacturing  equipment.  The  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  did  not  generate 
leachables  of  safety  concern  to  patients.  In  addition,  from  these  results,  it  was  confirmed  that  no 
leachables are present above the safety limit or the AET. 
The presented finished product manufacturing process, the proposed manufacturing control strategy for 
the manufacturing process and the performed process validation are considered acceptable. 
Product specification 
The specification for the finished product includes control of identity, purity and impurity, potency and 
other general tests. 
A comprehensive control strategy has been developed to ensure the quality of the final finished product.  
The  release  specifications  for  the  finished  product  includes  general  tests  (appearance  before 
reconstruction and after reconstruction (color and clarity), osmolality, pH, water content, reconstitution 
time), tests for identity , purity and impurity tests test for protein content (UV) and potency as well as 
tests  for  safety(visible  particles,  subvisible  particulate  matter,  endotoxin  and  test  for  sterility).  The 
acceptance criteria for the finished product specification parameters are considered appropriate.  
The potential presence of  elemental impurities in the active substance and finished product has been 
assessed on a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D guideline for elemental impurities. The risk 
of carryover of elemental impurities is considered negligible and no additional control is required. 
A  risk  evaluation  concerning  the  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been 
performed(as  requested) considering  all  suspected  and  actual  root  causes  in line  with  the  “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/Applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report - Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004  -  Nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/369136/2020).  Based  on  the 
information provided, it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities  in  the  active  substance  or  finished  product.  Therefore,  no  additional  control  measures  are 
deemed necessary. 
Analytical procedures  
The analytical procedures for the finished product are adequately described.  The procedures are either 
specific to the finished product or identical to the active substance.  Validation reports were provided.  
Batch analysis 
Data for all batches show that data is comparable across production scales and comparable between the 
formulations and strengths. All batches met the acceptance criteria in place at the time of release. 
Reference materials 
A DS-8201a reference standard is used for release and stability testing of DS-8201a finished product for 
the purpose of identity and potency. The same primary and secondary reference standards for the active 
substance are used as the reference standards for DS-8201a finished product testing.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021

Container closure 
The primary container closure of DS-8201a finished product is Type I amber glass 10 mL vials sealed 
with a 20 mm fluoro-resin laminated butyl rubber stopper and crimped with a 20 mm polypropylene/ 
aluminium  flip-off  cap  with  a  plastic  flip-off  disk.  The  container  closure integrity  has  been  adequately 
examined,  and  the  sterilisation  and  depyrogenation  for  the  container  closure  components  has  been 
validated as part of the process validation. 
A leachables study was performed on the finished product container closure system. The data presented 
supports the Applicant’s conclusion that the DS-8201a finished product would not generate leachables 
of concern for safety to the patient and, in addition, the potential amount of leachables would not have 
an impact on the quality of the finished product. 
Stability of the product 
A 24-month shelf life is proposed for the finished product when stored at 2-8°C in the proposed container 
closure system (unopened vial).  The proposed shelf life is considered supported by the long-term and 
accelerated  registration  stability  data.  The  stability  studies  are  performed  in  accordance  with  current 
guidelines. 
 The finished product registration batches placed into the stability program are considered representative 
of the material used in non-clinical and clinical studies as well as the material produced by the commercial 
process. 
Overall, the proposed shelf life of 2 years at 2 ºC to 8 ºC (unopened vial) is considered acceptable. 
In-use stability studies on the finished product reconstituted in 5 mL water for injections was performed 
as part of the product development and they support: 
- Storage of the reconstituted solution for up to 24 hours at 2 ºC to 8 ºC; 
- Storage of the reconstituted solution diluted in infusion bags containing 5% glucose solution at room 
temperature (≤ 30 ºC) for up to 4 hours or in a refrigerator at 2 ºC to 8 ºC for up to 24 hours. These 
storage times start from the time of reconstitution.  
A  photostability  study  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q1B  on  one  registration  batch.  All 
photostability  study  results  were  within  the  specifications.  The  lyophilisation  of  the  finished  product 
appears to protect the finished product from light-induced damage, since the DS-8201a finished product 
seems less light-sensitive than the DS-8201a DS. However, the diluted solution, if not used immediately, 
should be stored protected from light. 
Adventitious agents 
MAAL-9001 
Raw materials. 
No raw materials of animal- or human origin are used during the manufacture of the MAAL-9001 antibody 
active  substance.  The  bag,  used  as  container  closure  for  MAAL-900,  contains  additives  derived  from 
tallow.  
A risk assessment has been conducted evaluating the risk of transmitting TSE or adventitious viruses 
from  these  raw  materials  or  from  the  container  closure  system.  Based  on  the  processes  used  for 
manufacture of the raw materials/tallow-derived additives, the stage at which the specific material has 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 29/210 
 
 
 
been used, and of the origin of the animal-derived material (species and geographical), it is concluded 
that the TSE- or adventitious virus-related risk associated with MAAL-9001 is negligible.  
Cell banks 
The  master,  working,  and  limit-of-in-vitro-age  (LIVCA)  cell  banks  have  been  tested  according  to  ICH 
Q5A and Q5D for absence of non-viral (mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi) and viral adventitious agents, and 
endogenous  retroviruses.  The  testing  verified  the  absence  of  adventitious  agents  and  endogenous 
viruses, except for type A- and C- retrovirus-like particles, known to be present in the CHO cells.  
Bulk harvest 
Bulk harvest is routinely tested for the bioburden level and the absence of mycoplasma and adventitious 
viruses (IPCs). The bioburden and mycoplasma testing are conducted according to Ph. Eur. Testing for 
viral contaminants is conducted using a 28 days in vitro assay for adventitious viruses with MRC-5, Vero, 
CHO, and 324K cells as detector cells. Results have been provided from three commercial scale batches, 
verifying the absence of mycoplasma, bioburden, and viral contamination. 
Viral clearance studies 
The  viral  clearance  capacity  of  the  MAAL-9001  purification  process  was  evaluated  by  conducting  viral 
clearance  studies,  using  qualified  scale  down  models  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q5A.  The  scale  down 
procedure  is  considered  acceptable  and  the  scale  down  models  are  representative  of  the  commercial 
scale. The studies conducted at worse-case values were included where applicable. FMEA was employed 
to identify the CPPs for viral clearance capability based upon organisation experience, viral clearance, 
characterisation  of  development  experiments  for  the  MAAL-9001  manufacturing  process  and  from 
experience  with  similar  biological  products.  The  parameters  selected  by  FMEA  for  performing  virus 
clearance studies are considered relevant and appropriate.  
Four model viruses were used for the virus validation, including murine leukemia virus (MLV), reovirus 
3  (REO3),  pseudorabies  virus  (PRV),  and  mouse  minute  virus  (MMV).  The  selected  model  viruses 
represent  a  wide  range  of  particle  size,  genome-type,  and  degree  of  resistance  to  physico-chemical 
treatments.  
Based  on  the  cumulative  log  reduction  obtained  for  MLV,  a  safety  factor  has  been  determined  and  is 
considered a low and acceptable risk.  
Conclusion 
Overall, the risk of contamination of MAAL-9001 with adventitious agents, including TSE, mycoplasma, 
bacteria,  fungi,  and  viruses,  is  considered  well  contained  based  on  selection  of  safe  raw  materials, 
demonstration of absence of viral contaminants in cell banks, testing at relevant stages of the process, 
and finally the substantial virus clearance capacity demonstrated for the MAAL-9001 purification process.  
Trastuzumab deruxtecan active substance (DS-8201a) 
No animal- or human-derived materials are used in the manufacture of the DS8201a active substance, 
consisting  of  the  MAAL-9001  antibody,  for  which  adventitious  agents  safety  evaluation  is  described 
above, conjugated to the chemical drug-linker, MAAA-1162a. Tests for bioburden are routinely performed 
during manufacture of the active substance. No additional risk of contamination by adventitious agents 
is conferred by the DS8201a manufacturing process. 
Finished product 
No animal- or human-derived materials are used for formulation of the trastuzumab-deruxtecan finished 
product. No additional risk of contamination by adventitious agents is conferred by the finished product 
manufacturing process.

application for Enhertu is considered approvable from the quality point of view.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is an antibody drug conjugate, where 8 drug moieties are linked via a peptide 
linker to cysteine residues on the trastuzumab antibody. The drug linker will be cleaved and will 
release the deruxtecan moiety which has membrane permeability, e.g. it will permeate the cell 
membrane and have effect inside the cell, and it may even affect neighbouring cells, hence a 
bystander effect has been shown. Deruxtecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor, and DNA damage and 
apoptosis are observed. Trastuzumab, the antibody part of the ADC, will also have pharmacological 
activity, hence the ADC show both ADCC as well as drug mediated cellular toxicity. 
The nonclinical profile for the ADC, DS-8201a, and the released drug, MAAA-1181a, has been 
characterized through pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology studies.  The in vivo studies 
were primarily conducted via intravenous injection in mice, rats, and monkeys, as this is the intended 
route of administration in humans.  Safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were conducted in 
compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and were consistent with the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standards in effect at the time.  A nonclinical 
testing strategy for DS-8201a was developed based on the product characteristics and existing 
regulatory guidelines in the US, the EU, and Japan, including the Food and Drug Administration 
guidance “Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of 
Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products” (November 1995),

MAAL-9001 is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with MAAL-9001 DNA 
sequence.  Two MAAL-9001 producing cell lines have been established for the development of DS-
8201a.  The MAAL-9001 producing cell line was used to support preclinical studies and early stage of 
development.  The second MAAL-9001 producing cell line is used for early and late stage of 
development and for commercial manufacture.  MAAL-9001 manufacturing processes (mAb Process-1 
and mAb Process-2) are developed for each of MAAL-9001 producing cell lines. 
In nonclinical sections, MAAL-9001 and DS-8201a used in nonclinical studies are named as follows: 
MAAL-9001 produced by mAb Process-1 is referred to as MAAL-9001 (Process 1) and MAAL-9001 
produced by mAb Process-2 is referred to as MAAL-9001 (Process 2).   
DS-8201a manufactured using MAAL-9001 (Process 1) is referred to as DS-8201a (Process 1).  DS-
8201a manufactured using MAAL-9001 (Process 2) is referred to as DS-8201a (Process 2). 
Unless otherwise stated in this section, DS-8201a refers to DS-8201a (Process 1) and MAAL-9001 
refers to MAAL-9001 (Process 1). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
IN VITRO 
Binding activity and specificity of DS-8201a to human HER2: 
The binding activity of DS-8201a and MAAL-9001, the antibody component of DS-8201a, to human 
HER family (epidermal growth factor receptor, HER2, HER3, and HER4) and HER2 ortholog (mouse, 
rat, and cynomolgus monkey) proteins was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA). 
DS-8201a and MAAL-9001 specifically bound to both human HER2 and cynomolgus monkey HER2, but 
not to other human HER family or other HER2 ortholog proteins. The dissociation constant (Kd) values 
of DS-8201a and MAAL-9001 for human HER2 protein were 7.33 and 7.84 ng/mL, respectively. The Kd 
values of DS-8201a and MAAL-9001 for cynomolgus monkey HER2 protein were 7.46 and 7.48 ng/mL, 
respectively. 
The results indicate that DS-8201a and MAAL-9001 exhibit specific binding activity to both human and 
cynomolgus monkey HER2 and the impact of drug conjugation on the binding activity is minimal. 
HER2-specific cell growth inhibitory activity of DS-8201a in human cancer cells: 
In order to evaluate the cell growth inhibitory activity and specificity of DS-8201a, 5 human cancer cell 
lines were used: the lung adenocarcinoma cell line Calu-3, the gastric carcinoma cell line NCI-N87, the 
breast adenocarcinoma cell lines SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-468, and the breast cancer cell line KPL-4. 
Each cell line was treated with DS-8201a, MAAL-9001, or MAAA-9001b, an ADC with the same drug-
linker as DS-8201a in which MAAL-9001 has been replaced with a human IgG1 isotype control, at 
concentrations from 0.64 ng/mL to 10,000 ng/mL. Cell viability was evaluated 6 days after incubation 
by detection of adenosine triphosphate. The HER2 expression level of each cell line was determined by 
flow cytometric analysis with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-HER2 antibodies or isotype control 
antibodies.

Human HER2 was expressed on the Calu-3, KPL-4, NCI-N87, and SK-BR-3 cells, but not on the MDA-
MB-468 cells. DS-8201a exhibited cell growth inhibitory activity against HER2-positive Calu-3, KPL-4, 
NCI-N87, and SK-BR-3 cells, but not against HER2-negative MDA-MB-468 cells. On the other hand, 
MAAA-9001b showed no cell growth inhibitory activity against the cells tested. MAAL-9001 showed cell 
growth inhibitory activity only against NCI-N87 and SK-BR-3 cells, although not as much as DS-8201a. 
As a reference, all cell lines were sensitive to the active metabolite, MAAA-1181c. 
These results indicate that DS-8201a possesses HER2-specific activity. The activity was higher than 
that of the anti-HER2 antibody, MAAL-9001, and was observed even in MAAL-9001 insensitive cells 
except for HER2-negative MDA-MB-468 cells. 
Topoisomerase I inhibitory activity of MAAA-1181a: 
MAAA-1181a is expected to be released from DS-8201a in the cytoplasm after DS-8201a binds to 
HER2 and is internalized in tumor cells. Since human topoisomerase I can relax supercoiled DNA, the 
inhibitory activity of MAAA-1181a against human topoisomerase I was evaluated by a topoisomerase I-
mediated DNA relaxation assay using supercoiled DNA as a substrate. Human topoisomerase I is a 
type IB topoisomerase which can relax positive and negative supercoiled DNA and is an essential 
enzyme for DNA replication, transcription, and chromatin condensation. The inhibition of 
topoisomerase I causes cell death.  
Recombinant human topoisomerase I was incubated with MAAA-1181a for 5 min. Supercoiled pBR322 
DNA was then added and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes (final concentration of MAAA-1181a: 
20,000, 10,000, 5,000, 2,500, 1,250, 625, 312.5, 156.25, and 78.125 nmol/L). After the mixture was 
electrophoresed on an agarose gel, the amount of the supercoiled DNA was measured. MAAA-1181a 
inhibited the relaxation of supercoiled DNA caused by human topoisomerase I in a dose-dependent 
manner. This result indicates that MAAA-1181a has inhibitory activity against human topoisomerase I. 
Induction of DNA damage and apoptosis by DS-8201a: 
Since it has been reported that topoisomerase I inhibitors induce double-strand DNA breaks and 
apoptosis, the induction of DNA damage and apoptosis by DS-8201a was evaluated using the human 
breast cancer cell line KPL-4 in comparison with MAAL-9001 and MAAA-1181a. The KPL-4 cells were 
treated with DS-8201a, MAAL-9001, or MAAA-1181a. Phosphorylation of Chk1 and histone H2A.X was 
evaluated as DNA damage markers and cleaved poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase 
(PARP) as an apoptosis marker by a Western blotting method after 24, 48, and 72 hours. 
DS-8201a and MAAA-1181a induced the phosphorylation of Chk1 after 24 hours, the phosphorylation 
of histone H2A.X after 48 hours, and PARP cleavage after 72 hours, whereas MAAL-9001 induced no 
major changes in any markers. The results indicate that DS-8201a induced DNA damage and apoptosis 
in the same manner as MAAA-1181a, suggesting that these changes were caused by the 
topoisomerase I inhibition of the MAAA-1181a released from DS-8201a. 
Inhibitory activity of DS-8201a against intracellular phosphorylation of Akt 
MAAL-9001 has the same amino acid sequence as trastuzumab, and DS-8201a is therefore expected to 
have HER2-mediated Akt phosphorylation inhibitory activity and ADCC activity. In this study, the 
inhibitory activity of DS-8201a against the intracellular phosphorylation of Akt in human breast 
adenocarcinoma SK-BR-3 cells was evaluated by ELISA. The SK-BR-3 cells were incubated with DS-
8201a at concentrations from 1.524 ng/mL to 10,000 ng/mL. After 24 hours of incubation, 
phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and total Akt were measured using a commercially available ELISA kit. 
DS-8201a induced the downregulation of intracellular pAkt in the SK-BR-3 cells in a dose-dependent 
manner and the estimated minimum value of relative pAkt was 17.2%, and the ED50 value was 89.65 
CHMP assessment report

Page 33/210 
 
 
 
ng/mL. Conversely, the treatment of the control IgG ADC, MAAA-9001b, did not induce the distinct 
downregulation of the intracellular pAkt indicating. 
Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic activity of DS-8201a using human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (P140118): 
The ADCC activities of DS-8201a and MAAL-9001 were evaluated using human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells derived from 3 healthy donors as effector cells and human breast cancer SK-BR-3 
cells as target cells. The effector cells and the 51Cr-labeled target cells were incubated with DS-8201a 
or MAAL-9001 at concentrations from 0.001 ng/mL to 10,000 ng/mL and the ADCC activity was 
measured based on the radioactivity released from the target cells 4 hours after incubation. 
DS-8201a and MAAL-9001 exhibited ADCC activity against the SK-BR-3 cells. The 50% effective 
concentration (EC50) in the 2 donor samples were 3.8 and 5.9 ng/mL for DS-8201a, and 2.1 and 2.7 
ng/mL for MAAL-9001, whereas the EC50 for the other donor sample could not be calculated due to the 
low percentage of natural killer (NK) cells. 
These results suggest that DS-8201a possesses ADCC activity in the presence of human peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells, as does MAAL-9001, and that the impact of drug conjugation on ADCC 
activity is considered minimal. 
Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic activity of DS-8201a (Process 1 and Process 2) using natural 
killer cells (B161208): 
The ADCC activities of DS-8201a (Process 1) and DS-8201a (Process 2) were evaluated using human 
CD16-expressing NK cells as effector cells and human breast cancer SK-BR-3 cells as target cells. The 
effector cells and the 51Cr-labeled target cells were incubated with DS-8201a at concentrations from 
0.0508 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL and the ADCC activity was measured based on the radioactivity released 
from the target cells 4 hours after incubation. MAAA-9001b was also evaluated as a negative control. 
DS-8201a (Process 1) and DS-8201a (Process 2) exhibited ADCC activity against SK-BR-3 cells. The 
EC50 was 10.1 ng/mL for DS-8201a (Process 1) and 18.2 ng/mL for DS-8201a (Process 2). The 
maximum possible effect (Emax) was 41.8% for DS-8201a (Process 1) and 31.4% for DS-8201a 
(Process 2). 
IN VIVO 
Antitumor activity of DS-8201a (Process 1 and Process 2) and its antibody component in HER2-positive 
breast cancer xenograft model in nude mice (CR16-H0018-R06): 
The in vivo efficacy of DS-8201a was evaluated in a mouse xenograft model of HER2-positive breast 
cancer KPL-4 cells in female CAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu/CrlCrlj mice (nude mice) in a comparison with MAAL-
9001. In this study, the efficacies of two lots of DS-8201a as well as MAAL-9001 were compared in 
order to investigate the impact of the differences in in vitro ADCC activity as shown in study B161208. 
DS-8201a (Process 1), DS-8201a (Process 2), MAAL-9001 (Process 1), and MAAL-9001 (Process 2) 
were administered intravenously at a single dose of 10 mg/kg to the mice (n = 12/group) 13 days 
after inoculation (Day 0). The tumor dimensions and body weight of each mouse were measured twice 
a week until Day 21. The area under the curve (AUC) of tumor growth inhibition (TGI) against days 
after administration was calculated for DS-8201a. 
DS-8201a (Process 2) at 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor growth by 97.4% compared with the 
vehicle control group on Day 21 (P < 0.0001, Student’s t-test). The relative mean AUC of TGI for DS-
8201a (Process 2) compared to DS-8201a (Process 1) was 110.8% (95% confidence interval: 98.4% 
to 123.1%), which indicated that there is no significant difference in efficacy between DS-8201a 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021

(Process 2) and DS-8201a (Process 1). MAAL-9001 (Process 1) and MAAL-9001 (Process 2) inhibited 
tumor growth by 24.7% and 26.9%, respectively, on Day 21. 
These results suggest that the antitumor activity of DS-8201a is mainly derived from the activity of the 
conjugated drug, MAAA-1181a, and no apparent difference in antitumor activity in vivo was observed 
between the 2 lots of DS-8201a and MAAL-9001 tested. 
Antitumor activity of DS-8201a in a trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer xenograft 
model in nude mice (CR16-H0018-R23): 
The HER2-positive breast cancer cell line JIMT-1 was derived from a trastuzumab-resistant patient and 
is known to be refractory to T-DM1. In this study, the in vivo efficacy of DS-8201a was evaluated in 
comparison with that of T-DM1 and MAAL-9002b in a mouse xenograft model of JIMT-1 cells. JIMT-1 
cells were inoculated into female CAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu/CrlCrlj mice (nude mice) and DS-8201a, T-DM1, 
and MAAL-9002b were administered intravenously at a single dose of 3 or 10 mg/kg for DS-8201a and 
10 mg/kg for T-DM1 and MAAL-9002b to the mice (n = 10/group) 10 days after inoculation (Day 0). 
The tumor dimensions and body weight of each mouse were measured twice a week until Day 21. 
DS-8201a at 3 and 10 mg/kg, T-DM1 at 10 mg/kg, and MAAL-9002b at 10 mg/kg significantly 
inhibited tumor growth by 64%, 85%, 35%, and 66%, respectively, compared with the vehicle control 
on Day 21 (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.0001, respectively, Dunnett’s test). 
Furthermore, DS-8201a at 10 mg/kg showed significantly greater efficacy than T-DM1 and MAAL-
9002b (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0003, respectively, Student’s t-test). The results suggest that DS-8201a 
is effective even in T-DM1-refractory HER2-positive breast cancer tumors and that the high DAR results 
in higher efficacy. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Two dedicated safety pharmacology studies were performed. A hERG study and an in vivo cynomolgus 
study with telemetered animals, where cardiovascular, respiratory and CNS endpoints were evaluated.  
Safety Pharmacology Study of MAAA-1181a on hERG Channels in hERG Transfected CHO 
Cells (SBL315-029, GLP study) 
The effect of MAAA-1181a on the hERG currents, which are responsible for the rapidly activating 
component of delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr), was evaluated using the whole-cell patch 
clamp method. MAAA-1181a monohydrate was applied by perfusion at concentrations of 1, 3, and 10 
μmol/L to hERG transfected CHO cells at room temperature (n = 5/concentration). The tail peak 
currents were used as an indicator of the hERG currents, and the compensated suppression rates of 
the tail peak currents, corrected for the negative control value, were used to evaluate the test article’s 
effect on the hERG currents. A negative control (physiological saline diluted 188-fold with Tyrode 
solution), and a known selective IKr blocker, E-4031 at 0.1 μmol/L, as the positive control, were 
applied to the cells in the same manner as the test article. 
The compensated suppression rates of MAAA-1181a at 1, 3, and 10 μmol/L for the tail peak current 
were −4.24%, 0.42%, and −0.74%, respectively. MAAA-1181a had no statistically significant effect on 
tail peak currents at any concentrations in comparison with the negative control. E-4031, the positive 
control, at 0.1 μmol/L produced a statistically significant decrease in tail peak currents in comparison 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021

with the negative control (79.34%). This result indicates that the test system was reliable and suitably 
sensitive to detect the inhibitory effect of the test article on hERG currents. 
In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, MAAA-1181a had no effect on hERG currents at 1, 3, 
or 10 μmol/L in hERG transfected CHO cells. MAAA-1181a had no effect on hERG channel current at 
concentrations up to 10 µmol/L (approximately 5000 ng/mL), at which there was a sufficient margin of 
exposure compared with the Cmax (7.2 ng/mL) of MAAA-1181a in patients administered at 5.4 mg/kg 
of DS-8201a in the clinical study (Study DS8201-A-U201). 
Safety Pharmacology Study of DS-8201a on the Cardiovascular, Respiratory, and Central 
Nervous Systems in Monkeys (SBL315-061, GLP study) 
A safety pharmacology study of DS-8201a on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous 
systems was conducted in 8 conscious and unrestrained male cynomolgus monkeys (4 years to 6 years 
old) using a telemetry system, blood gas analysis, and a functional observational battery method. DS-
8201a dissolved in a control article (10 mmol/L histidine buffer [pH 5.8], 10 w/v% trehalose, and 0.02 
w/v% polysorbate 20) was intravenously administered at single doses of 30 or 78.8 mg/kg (dose 
volume, 4 mL/kg; rate of administration, 3 mL/min). The control article was administered to all 8 
animals on Day 1 and then the test article was administered to the 30 and 78.8 mg/kg groups (4 
animals/group) on Day 22. 
Blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean), heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters (PR 
interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and QT interval corrected with Bazett’s formula), respiratory rate, 
blood gas parameters (arterial blood pH, arterial oxygen tension, arterial carbon dioxide tension, and 
haemoglobin oxygen saturation), intra-abdominal body temperature, presence or absence of 
arrhythmia, general behaviour and neurobehavioral function were evaluated. Clinical signs, body 
weight, and food consumption were also evaluated. At 30 and 78.8 mg/kg, there were no test article-
related changes in blood pressure, heart rate, any ECG parameter, respiratory rate, any blood gas 
parameter, intra-abdominal body temperature, or general behaviour or neurobehavioral function. 
There was no arrhythmia at either dose level. At 30 mg/kg, no abnormalities in clinical signs were 
observed in any animal. At 78.8 mg/kg, vomiting (including retching) was observed sporadically in 3 
animals between approximately 6 and 47.5 hours after the end of administration. Soft stool and/or 
diarrhoea were observed in 3 animals between 4 and 11 days after administration. Abnormal skin 
colour (brownish black) was observed in all animals between 9 days after administration and the final 
observation day. A decrease in food consumption was observed in 2 animals between 1 and 8 days 
after administration at 30 mg/kg and in 3 animals between 1 and 10 days after administration at 78.8 
mg/kg. In 3 animals that were treated with 78.8 mg/kg, a decrease in body weight was also observed 
6, 13, and 20 days after administration. 
In conclusion, under the conditions of the present study, DS-8201a had no effect on the 
cardiovascular, respiratory, or central nervous systems at doses of up to 78.8 mg/kg when 
administered once intravenously to male monkeys. 
Cardiovascular endpoints were also included in the repeat dose study (SBL-315-031), where the 
animals were dosed once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks, at doses of 0, 10, 30 or 78.8 mg/kg. 
Shortening of PR interval and prolongation of QTc was observed in the 78.8 mg/kg group, and related 
to treatment with DS-8201a. 
MAAA-1181d had no effect on hERG currents at 1, 3, or 10 μM in hERG transfected CHO cells. Also, a 
safety pharmacology study of DS-8201a was conducted in male cynomolgus monkeys using a 
telemetry system, blood gas analysis, and a functional observational battery method. DS-8201a had 
no effect on the cardiovascular, respiratory, or central nervous systems at doses of up to 78.8 mg/kg.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been conducted since this application (see 
discussion on non - clinical pharmacology). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The in vivo pharmacokinetic studies with DS-8201a (trastuzumab deruxtecan) were conducted via 
intravenous (IV) injection, as this is the intended clinical route of administration, to rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys, which were used for toxicology studies. Tissue distribution was evaluated in 
monkeys. The in vitro metabolic profile of DS-8201a was evaluated in plasma and in hepatocytes. The 
in vivo metabolism and excretion of DS-8201a was investigated in plasma, urine and faeces of monkey 
and the in vivo metabolism and excretion of MAAA-1181a in rats. 
Methods of analysis 
Ligand binding assays were developed and validated to determine the concentrations of DS-8201a and 
total antibody (the sum of conjugated and unconjugated antibody) in mouse, rat, and monkey plasma. 
Electro-chemiluminescence assay (ECLA) methods were developed and validated to determine the anti-
DS-8201a antibody (ADA) and anti-MAAL-9001 antibody concentrations in rat and monkey plasma. 
Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were developed and 
validated to determine the MAAA-1181a concentrations in the samples. 
Absorption 
A single dose, non-GLP, IV administration study in cynomolgus monkeys were performed. 
Furthermore, a single dose PK study was performed comparing the two process DS-8201a (Process 1 
and 2), which is presented and discussed under the heading “other PK studies”.   
Pharmacokinetics after Single Intravenous Administration of DS-8201a in Cynomolgus 
Monkeys (SBL315-043) 
The PK of DS-8201a, total antibody, and MAAA-1181a were investigated after single intravenous 
administration of DS-8201a at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg to male fasted cynomolgus monkeys 
(n = 3/group). The plasma DS-8201a, total antibody, anti-DS-8201a antibody, and MAAA-1181a 
concentrations were measured pre-dose and at designated time points (0.083, 1, 7 hours, 1, 3, 7, 14, 
21, and 28 days post-dose). 
The plasma DS-8201a concentrations decreased exponentially after single intravenous administration. 
The AUC of DS-8201a increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner. The CL (14.0 mL/d/kg to 
55.7 mL/d/kg) decreased with the dose ranged from 0.1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg. The t1/2 and MRTinf were 
longer at 1 and 3 mg/kg (t1/2, 2.90 and 3.92 day; MRTinf, 2.55 and 3.84 day) than at 0.1 and 0.3 
mg/kg (t1/2, 0.641 and 0.686 day; MRTinf, 0.834 and 0.867 day). The Vss (30.6 mL/kg to 55.4 
mL/kg) of DS-8201a was close to the plasma volume and no difference was noted between the doses 
of DS-8201a. 
No significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters between DS-8201a and 
total antibody. No anti-DS-8201a antibodies were detected in any animals. All individual MAAA-1181a 
concentrations were below the LLOQ (0.100 ng/mL) at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg. Low plasma concentrations 
of MAAA-1181a were detected at a few time points at 1 and 3 mg/kg (lower than 0.195 and 0.709 
ng/mL, respectively). 
Toxicokinetics after Repeated Intravenous Administration of DS-8201a 
Rats: Six-week Intermittent Dose Toxicity Study (SBL315-030) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021

The toxicokinetic (TK) of DS-8201a, total antibody, and MAAA-1181a were evaluated in a GLP-
compliant 6-week intermittent dose (once every 3 weeks [q3w]) toxicity study of DS-8201a by 
intravenous bolus injection. 
The toxicokinetic parameters of DS-8201a, total antibody, and MAAA-1181a are summarized in the 
below table.  The C0 and AUC21d values of DS-8201a and total antibody generally increased along 
with the dose ranged from 20 mg/kg to 197 mg/kg.  The Cmax and AUC21d values of MAAA-1181a 
also generally increased along with the dose ranged from 20 mg/kg to 197 mg/kg.  No apparent 
changes after repeated dosing nor any apparent sex differences were noted in the toxicokinetic 
parameters.  Anti-DS-8201a antibodies were not detected in any animals during the dosing or recovery 
period.

Cynomolgus Monkeys: Six-week Intermittent Dose Toxicity Study (SBL315-031) 
The TK of DS-8201a, total antibody, and MAAA-1181a were evaluated in a GLP-compliant 6-week 
intermittent dose (q3w) toxicity study of DS-8201a by intravenous bolus injection. 
The toxicokinetic parameters of DS-8201a, total antibody, and MAAA-1181a are summarized in the 
table below. The C0 and AUC21d values of DS-8201a and total antibody generally increased along with 
the dose ranged from 10 mg/kg to 78.8 mg/kg. The Cmax and AUC21d values of MAAA-1181a also 
generally increased along with the dose ranged from 10 mg/kg to 78.8 mg/kg. No apparent changes 
after repeated dosing nor any apparent sex differences were noted in the toxicokinetic parameters. 
Anti-DS-8201a antibodies were not detected in any animals during the dosing or recovery period.

Rats and Cynomolgus Monkeys: Six-week Intermittent Dose Toxicity Studies of MAAL-9001 
(SBL315-144 and SBL315-143) 
The TK of MAAL-9001 were evaluated in GLP-compliant 6-week intermittent dose (q3w) toxicity studies 
of MAAL-9001 (Process 1) in rats and cynomolgus monkeys by intravenous bolus injection. 
The toxicokinetic parameters of MAAL 9001 in rats and cynomolgus monkeys are summarized in table 
below. No apparent changes after repeated dosing nor any apparent sex differences were noted in the 
toxicokinetic parameters. Anti-MAAL-9001 antibodies were not detected in any animals in rat study. 
While anti-MAAL-9001 antibody was detected in 1 female monkey in the 78.8 mg/kg group on Day 43 
of dosing, no effects on TK parameters were seen.

Distribution 
Tissue distribution was examined in the cynomolgus monkey, using autoradioluminography following 
single dose of 3H-labelled Trastuzumab deruxtecan or 14C-labelled Trastuzumab deruxtecan, of which 
the drug component MAAA-1181a was 14C labelled. Tissue distribution was evaluated 1 and 14 days 
after administration by whole-body autoradioluminography. 
The radioactivity was located mainly to the blood, and well perfused organs. The only organ with a 
higher radioactivity score was the large intestine, after administration of 14C-labelles trastuzumab 
deruxtecan. No apparent retention in any organs was observed, as the radioactivity had decreased in 
all tissues from 1 to 14 days post dose. In vitro blood cell distribution of the drug moiety of the ADC 
(MAAA-1181a) as well as the plasma protein binging were examined. The blood cell distribution ratios 
of 14C-MAAA-1181a radioactivity ranged from 31.6% to 33.8% in mice, 27.8% to 32.7% in rats, 
36.4% to 39.7% in monkeys, and 13.0% to 17.7% in humans.  The ratio of the concentration of 
radioactivity in blood to that in plasma was 0.82 to 0.85 in mice, 0.81 to 0.87 in rats, 0.92 to 0.95 in 
monkeys, and 0.59 to 0.62 in humans. The mean plasma protein binding ratios ranged from 90.3% to 
92.5% in mice, 94.2% to 96.7% in rats, 86.5% to 89.1% in monkeys, and 96.8% to 98.0% in 
humans.  
Metabolism 
In vitro metabolite profiling was performed. The theoretical release rate of the drug moiety of the ADC 
was examined in mouse, rat, monkey and human plasma as well as PBS+1%BSA, and it was shown 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 43/210 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that the release rates were comparable between doses at 10 and 100 µg/mL, and similar across the 
species tested as well. the highest release of the drug moiety was 3.9 %, observed in the monkey at a 
dose of 10 µg/mL.  
In vitro metabolism of trastuzumab deruxtecan was examined in rat, monkey and human hepatocytes. 
No human specific metabolites were detected. 6 metabolite peaks were identified in all species. The 
most abundant metabolite was unchanged MAAA-1181a, detected at only 0.1% of the total amount of 
free and conjugated drug. Hence, the applicant concluded that trastuzumab deruxtecan is metabolic 
stable in the in vitro cryopreserved hepatocyte incubation system. This is accepted.  The rat and 
monkey are considered appropriate for characterising the toxicity of trastuzumab deruxtecan, and the 
drug moiety of the ADC. 
The in vivo metabolism of DS 8201a was investigated in one male cynomolgus monkey. After a single 
intravenous administration of 14C DS 8201a (6.4 mg/kg), the majority of label was found to be 
conjugated to the antibody in plasma. Only 14C-MAAA 1181a radioactivity was found to be present in 
plasma but as <1%. Also, in urine and faeces only one major labelled peak was found across the time 
periods up to 144h, which was identified as 14C-MAAA-1181a. 
Metabolic profiling of a mass balance study in rats using 14C-labelled MAAA 1181a (1 mg/kg) showed 
that one main (>1%) labelled peak (86% - 89% of total radioactivity) was detected in urine, faeces, 
and bile (0 - 48h). Metabolic profiling showed that the radioactive component was MAAA-1181a and it 
was present in urine, faeces, and bile as 23%, 61% and 63%, respectively, of the dose after a single 
IV administration. In faeces one other peak >1% (1.1%) was detected but not identified. This 
indicates that metabolism of MAAA-1181a is low and mainly excreted as unchanged MAAA 1181a in 
rat. 
Excretion 
The excretion of trastuzumab deruxtecan and the drug moiety was examined in monkeys following 
single IV administration of 14C labelled ADC or drug moiety alone. With respect to both the ADC and 
the drug moiety, the major route of excretion was faeces, with approximately 60 to 70% of the 
recovered radioactivity detected in the faeces, and only approximately 20 to 30% excreted in urine. 
Negligible amounts were recovered in the expired air.  
A study was also performed in bile cannulated rats, administered 14C-labelled deruxtecan (MAAA-
1181a). Here it was shown that the bile was the primary route of excretion (71.6% of the excreted 
radioactivity recovered in bile), with only 21.9% in urine, and 2.7% in feces. In normal rats 70% was 
found in faeces and 27% in urine at 168h after dosing. MAAA-1181a was the most abundant 
component of radioactivity. Elimination of MAAA-1181a was found to be fast as at the 0 - 4h time 
period bile excretion was almost maximal. 
In vitro pharmacokinetic drug interactions have been studied using human biomaterials and are 
described in the clinical part of this MAA.  
Other PK studies 
Pharmacokinetics after Single Intravenous Administration of DS-8201a (Process 1) or DS-8201a 
(Process 2) to Cynomolgus Monkeys (SBL315-376 and SBL315-532): 
The PK of DS-8201a, total antibody, and MAAA-1181a were investigated after single intravenous 
administration of DS-8201a (Process 1 [Lot: HA104-U]) or DS-8201a (Process 2 [Lot: HA202]) at 
8.0 mg/kg to male fasted cynomolgus monkeys (n = 12/group).  The plasma DS-8201a, total 
antibody, anti-DS-8201a antibody, and MAAA-1181a concentrations were measured pre-dose and at 
designated time points (0.083, 1, 7 hours, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days post-dose). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 44/210 
 
 
 
The geometric mean ratios of DS-8201a (Process 2)/DS-8201a (Process 1) for the Cmax, AUCinf, and 
AUC21d of DS-8201a were 0.865 (90% confidence interval [CI]: 0.809 to 0.925), 0.779 (90% CI: 
0.700 to 0.867), and 0.784 (90% CI: 0.709 to 0.867), respectively.  Anti-DS-8201a antibodies for 
both drug substances were not detected through 21 days after administration in any animals. 
No significant differences were observed between the kinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC) of the two 
processes, at dose levels of 8.0 mg/kg. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
All toxicology studies were conducted in compliance with GLP regulations and were consistent with the 
OECD standards in effect at the time. The toxicity of trastuzumab deruxtecan, the drug moiety alone 
as well as the antibody moiety alone were examined in the nonclinical toxicity program. Rat and 
cynomolgus monkey were chosen by the Applicant as the nonclinical species. 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies of DS-8201a have been conducted in accordance with the ICH M3(R2), 
since the acute toxicity information is available from the repeated dose toxicity studies. In a 6-week 
intermittent dose (q3w) toxicity study in rats, skin trauma and/or crust was observed in a female at 20 
mg/kg and in both sexes at ≥60 mg/kg, and sparse fur and/or loss of fur in both sexes at 197 mg/kg 
from Day 8 of dosing. Decreased food consumption was observed in males and females at 197 mg/kg 
on Day 2 of dosing, and decreased body weight was observed on Day 3 or later. There were no deaths 
or moribund animals throughout the study, and the approximate lethal dose for a single administration 
in rats was determined to be >197 mg/kg. In a 6-week intermittent dose (q3w) toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys, diarrhea was observed from Day 8 of dosing at 78.8 mg/kg. Decreased food 
consumption was observed in 1 male and 1 female from Day 2, followed by decreased body weight.  
After two doses of 78.8 mg/kg, 1 female was prematurely euthanized on Day 26 due to the 
deteriorated condition resulted from decreased body weight and food consumption as well as bone 
marrow toxicity and intestinal toxicity. However, there were no serious toxic findings leading to death 
or moribundity after the first dose.  Based on the above results, the approximate lethal dose for a 
single administration in cynomolgus monkeys was determined to be >78.8 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose studies were performed in rats and monkeys. Studies with trastuzumab deruxtecan, as 
well as studies where MAAA-181a was administered alone, and studies with administration of MAAL-
9001 alone were also performed. Intermittent dosing regimens were employed. The pivotal studies 
were performed in accordance to GLP (below table).

In the studies with trastuzumab deruxtecan, the rodent study and one monkey study were performed 
with process 1 material, whereas the 2 additional cynomolgus monkey studies were performed with 
process 2 material.  
The highest non-severely toxic dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan was established at 197 mg/kg in rats 
(non-binding species), and 30 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkey (78 mg/kg resulted in moribundity in one

female, and the changes observed for this female resulting in euthanasia on Day 26 of the study, were 
also seen in the remaining animals in the high dose group). The subsequent studies were performed 
with 30 mg/kg as the high dose level, and this dose was tolerated. The target organs and tissues were 
intestines; lymphatic/haematopoietic system, lungs (cynomolgus monkey only), kidneys, skin, testes, 
incisor teeth (rat only). Two studies were performed with intermittent dosing (q1w, 5 administrations) 
of the drug moiety alone (MAAA-1181a), in rat and cynomolgus monkey respectively. The toxicities 
observed were similar compared to the findings in the repeat dose toxicity studies with trastuzumab 
deruxtecan, except additional ocular toxicity (rat and NHP) as well as heart and liver toxicity (NHP 
only), but no pulmonary, renal, skin and testicular toxicity were seen with MAAA-1181a alone. The 
ocular toxicity, cardiotoxicity and livertoxicity were observed at exposure multiples of 14-fold the 
human AUC (based on cynomolgus monkey exposure following 12 mg/kg dose). Based on Cmax, the 
safety margins are well in excess of any clinical relevance, 6900-fold human Cmax. The liver toxicity 
was observed at exposure multiples of 14-fold the human AUC. Based on Cmax, the safety margins are 
well in excess of any clinical relevance, 6900-fold human Cmax.  
Toxicities observed in cynomolgus monkeys after administration of the free drug deruxtecan were 
associated with much higher deruxtecan plasma exposure levels than when the ADC was administered. 
The apparent higher sensitivity after ADC administration as well as the occurrence of additional 
toxicities (lung, kidney, skin and testis) is likely explained by the different plasma/tissue concentration-
time profiles for deruxtecan. After administration of the ADC, deruxtecan plasma levels are lower, but 
present over extended periods of times, whereas after administration of free drug, deruxtecan is 
cleared from the plasma in a short period of time.     
In order to characterise the toxicity of the antibody moiety of trastuzumab deruxtecan (MAAL-9001), 
two repeat dose studies were performed (one in rats and one in monkeys. In 6-week intermittent dose 
toxicity studies of MAAL-9001, MAAL-9001 was administered intravenously (q3w) to rats at 0 and 197 
mg/kg (SBL315-144) and to cynomolgus monkeys at 0 and 78.8 mg/kg (SBL315-143). In these 
toxicity studies, no test article-related toxic changes were observed. The no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) was considered to be the high dose level in both species; 197 mg/kg in rats and 
78.8 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. 
Comparative exposure for the toxicities observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies is presented in the 
below table.

MAAA-1181a was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation test (SBL315-617), but was found to be 
positive in the in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration test (SBL315-618) as well as causing an 
increased number of micronucleated immature erythrocytes (SBL315-756). No increase in the 
proportion of immature erythrocytes was observed. The exposure level in male rats was 27.8 ng*d/mL, 
where the clinical plasma exposure level following the recommended human dose, is 30.5 ng*d/mL.  
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Reproduction Toxicity 
No fertility and early embryonic development to implantation studies, effects on pre and postnatal 
development, including maternal function studies or embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies have 
been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Effects on the reproductive system following the intravenous administration of DS-8201a were 
evaluated in intermittent dose toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys.  In the 6-week 
intermittent dose toxicity study in rats, small-sized testes and epididymides accompanying reduced 
organ weights were observed at 197 mg/kg.  Histopathological findings in rats included spermatid 
retention at 20 and 60 mg/kg, and tubular degeneration/atrophy in the testes accompanied by 
secondary changes of luminal cell debris and reduced sperm in the epididymides at 197 mg/kg.  In the 
6-week and 3-month intermittent dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, decreased number of 
round spermatids in the Stage V-VI seminiferous tubule in the testes was observed at ≥30 mg/kg. 
Toxicology studies in rats and monkeys with DS-8201a or MAAA-1181a indicated toxic effects to 
rapidly dividing cells (lymphatic/hematopoietic organ, intestines, or testes) (see above).

Other toxicity studies 
Tissue Cross-reactivity Study of DS-8201a with Human Tissues (20064734, GLP Study) 
The potential tissue cross-reactivity of DS-8201a was evaluated using a normal human tissue panel 
(38 tissues).  DS-8201a or a human IgG1κ (isotype control article) was applied to a full panel of 
normal human tissues from at least 3 separate individuals at 2 concentrations (1 and 10 µg/mL) and 
immunohistochemically detected using a biotinylated anti-human IgG precomplex method.  An NCI-
N87 (human gastric cancer) cell xenograft was used as a positive control sample and an MDA-MB-468 
(human breast adenocarcinoma) cell xenograft was used as a negative control sample.   
Specific DS-8201a staining was observed in the cytoplasm and/or cell membrane of 
syncytiotrophoblasts and decidual cells in the placenta at 1 µg/mL or more.  Specific staining was also 
observed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in multiple human tissues including the breast, cervix, 
colon, fallopian tube, kidney, ocular lens fibers, pancreas, parathyroid, pituitary, prostate, salivary 
gland, skin, small intestine, stomach, thymus, thyroid, tonsil, ureter, urinary bladder, and uterus-
endometrium.  However, the biological relevance of cytoplasmic staining is low because the antibody is 
not able to access to the cytoplasmic compartment directly in vivo. 
Tissue Cross-reactivity Study of DS-8201a with Cynomolgus Monkey Tissues (20069107, 
GLP Study) 
The potential tissue cross-reactivity of DS-8201a was evaluated using selected cynomolgus monkey 
tissues (bone marrow, brain, heart, intestines, kidney, liver, lung, skin, spleen, and testis).  DS-8201a 
or a human IgG1κ (isotype control article) was applied to the cynomolgus monkey tissues from 3 
separate individuals at 2 concentrations (1 and 10 µg/mL) and immunohistochemically detected using 
a biotinylated anti-human IgG precomplex method.  An NCI-N87 cell xenograft was used as a positive 
control sample and an MDA-MB-468 cell xenograft was used as a negative control sample.   
Neither membranous nor cytoplasmic staining was noted in the cynomolgus monkey tissues tested.  No 
staining on the cell membrane in the selected cynomolgus monkey tissues was consistent with the 
results obtained for the corresponding human tissues. 
Intermittent Dose Toxicity Study in Rats Treated Intravenously with MAAA-1181a 
Monohydrate Once Weekly for 4 Weeks Followed by a 4-week Recovery Period (SBL315-026, 
GLP Study) 
MAAA-1181a monohydrate was intravenously administered intermittently once weekly for 4 weeks 
(Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 of dosing, 5 times in total) to Crl:CD(SD) rats (10 animals/sex/group) at 
dose levels of 0 (vehicle: physiological saline), 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg (calculated as MAAA-1181a).  
Additional animals (5 animals/sex) were treated at dose levels of 0 and 30 mg/kg for 4 weeks and 
used to assess the reversibility of the toxic changes after a 4-week recovery period.  An additional 
satellite group of 4 animals of each sex was established for TK assessment of MAAA-1181a 
There was no test article-related death or moribundity, and no test article-related toxic changes were 
noted in clinical signs, ophthalmology, urinalysis, or necropsy at any dose level during the dosing or 
recovery period. 
In both sexes, the following changes were noted at ≥3 mg/kg: transient suppression of body weight 
gain and low food consumption; decreased erythroid parameters (erythrocyte count, hemoglobin 
concentration, hematocrit value, and reticulocyte ratio); decreased white blood cell parameters 
(leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil counts); and high levels in 
serum glucose.  Histopathological findings included decreased erythroblasts and myelocytes in the 
bone marrow; single cell necrosis in the lymphocytes in the thymus with decreased organ weight;

atrophy of the follicles in the submandibular lymph nodes and/or ileac Peyer’s patches; single cell 
necrosis of the crypt epithelial cells in the small and large intestines, and in the corneal epithelium; 
and atrophy of the villi in the duodenum. 
Additional changes at 30 mg/kg included: atrophy of the thymus in both sexes; and regeneration of 
the crypt epithelial cells with luminal dilatation in the cecum in a male. 
By the end of the 4-week recovery period, the changes observed during the dosing period showed 
reversibility. 
Under the conditions of this study, the target organs/tissues of MAAA-1181a included intestines, 
lymphatic/hematopoietic system and cornea.  The STD10 was determined to be greater than 30 mg/kg 
because the changes were not severe to induce a deteriorated condition, moribundity, or death. 
Intermittent Dose Toxicity Study in Monkeys Treated Intravenously with MAAA-1181a 
Monohydrate Once Weekly for 4 Weeks Followed by a 4-week Recovery Period (SBL315-032, 
GLP Study) 
MAAA-1181a monohydrate was intravenously administered once weekly (Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 of 
dosing, 5 times in total) to cynomolgus monkeys (3 animals/sex/group) at a dose level of 0 (vehicle: 
physiological saline), 1, 3, or 12 mg/kg.  Additional animals (2 animals/sex) were treated with 
MAAA-1181a at a dose level of 12 mg/kg for 4 weeks and used to assess the reversibility of the toxic 
changes after a 4-week recovery period.  TK assessments were conducted for MAAA-1181a. 
In the 12 mg/kg group, 1 male was euthanized due to moribundity on Day 12 of dosing and 1 female 
died on Day 23 of dosing.  Clinical observations in these animals included vomiting, diarrhea, lateral 
position, hypothermia, pale oral mucosa, and/or suppression of touch response.  Additionally, 
decreased body weight and food consumption and/or no consumption of food were noted.  The 
abnormal findings were observed in hematology (decreased in hematocrit value and lymphocyte 
count), and blood chemistry (increases in aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase; decreases 
in sodium and chloride).  
The following histopathological changes were observed in these animals: degeneration/necrosis of 
cardiac myocytes in the heart (only in the male), decreased erythroblasts and myelocytes in the bone 
marrow, atrophy of the follicles and the periarterial lymphatic sheath in the spleen, atrophy of the 
follicles in the mesenteric lymph nodes and ileac Peyer’s patches, single cell necrosis, focal necrosis, 
and increased mitosis of hepatocytes, bile thrombus and dilatation of the bile canaliculus, brown 
pigment deposition in Kupffer cells in the liver, and regeneration of the crypt epithelial cells, single cell 
necrosis of the crypt epithelial cells and/or dilatation of crypt in the small and large intestines.  The 
cause of moribundity was considered related to the animal’s deteriorated clinical condition resulted 
from decreased body weight and/or food consumption as well as lesions of the intestine and bone 
marrow. 
In the surviving animals, the following changes that were similar to those noted in the animals that 
died prematurely were noted: decreases in reticulocyte ratio, atrophy of the follicles in the spleen, 
mesenteric lymph nodes, and ileac Peyer’s patches, and single cell necrosis of lymphocytes in the 
thymus at ≥1 mg/kg; vomiting, decreases in body weight, and increases in aspartate transaminase at 
≥3 mg/kg.  At 12 mg/kg, abnormal stool, increases in alanine transaminase, single cell necrosis in the 
hepatocytes, and single cell necrosis of the crypt epithelial cells in the small intestine were observed.  
Additional changes in the animals in the 12 mg/kg group included decreases in erythrocyte parameters 
(erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit value) and lymphocyte count, an 
increase in platelet count, prolongation and shortening of activated partial thromboplastin time, 
increases in inorganic phosphorus and potassium, and single cell necrosis in the corneal epithelium.

No test article-related abnormalities were noted in urinalysis in any group. 
The test article-related changes noted during the dosing period showed recovery by the end of the 
recovery period. 
Under the conditions of this study, the target organs/tissues of MAAA-1181a included the heart, bone 
marrow, lymphatic organs, liver, intestines, and cornea. The HNSTD was determined to be 3 mg/kg in 
both sexes based on the moribundity or death observed at 12 mg/kg. 
Antigenicity 
No standalone studies were performed. Antidrug-antibody (ADA) analysis was included in the pivotal 
toxicity studies. No ADA were detected in the rat study (SBL315-030). In the monkey studies, only 
pre-dose samples in a few animals in two of the four studies showed detectable ADA (one male in 
study SBL315-031, 3 animals in Study SBL315-526). No other animals were positive for ADA during 
the studies. 
Phototoxicity 
MAAA-1181a was found to be phototoxic under the conditions of the in vitro 3T3 NRU assay, with a 
mean photo effect value of 0.432. However, in the subsequent in vivo study, in pigmented rats, 
administered doses of 0, 1 or 3 mg/kg MAAA-1181a intravenously, the drug did not show any 
phototoxic potential. The high dose group, provided a safety margin to the clinical Cmax, of 13-fold 
(90.5 ng/mL in rats, compared to 7.2 ng/mL In clinical study DS8201-A-U201). Therefore, the 
negative in vivo study result is considered to be sufficient to overrule the in vitro positive result. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of an anti-HER2 antibody, 
MAAL-9001, and a topoisomerase I inhibitor, MAAA-1181a, bound together by a peptide-based 
cleavable linker with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of approximately 8. The antibody- and linker are 
of biological origin, and is expected to be metabolised in the body, and the use of which will not alter 
the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, these two moieties 
are not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
With regards to the drug-part of the ADC, MAAA-1181a is considered not to be PBT, nor vPvB. A risk to 
the STP, surface water, groundwater, sediment and terrestrial compartment is not anticipated based 
on the prescribed use of Enhertu. 
Calculation of PECsurface water 
Enhertu is dosed at 5.4 mg/kg body weight once every three weeks. MAAA-1181a released after 
application is 2.5% of the dose and calculated as: 
On average, the target number of drug-linker (MAAA-1162a [drug + linker molecule]) to 1 antibody 
molecule is 8. The molecular weight of MAAA-1162a is 1034.05 and the molecular weight of the MAAL-
9001 is approximately 150,000 Da. Therefore, the total molecular weight of trastuzumab deruxtecan is 
approximately 158,000 Da. On average 8 molecules of the active drug (MAAA-1181a at 493.484 Da) 
are present on each molecule (8 × 493.484 = 3947.872 Da), thus MAAA-1181a represents 
approximately 2.5% of the total dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan (3947.872 ÷ 158 000 = 2.5%). On 
the basis of the average body weight of a European adult of 70.8 kg (Walpole et al., 2012) a dose of 
9.56 mg/patient/day (5.4 x 70.8 x 0.025) is calculated for the default phase I PEC calculation.

Refinement of Fpen  
The applicant has indicated that based on posology, the drug is dosed once every three weeks, the 
PECsw would be below the action limit 0.01 µg/L but has performed an Fpen refinement based on 
prevalence.  
The highest breast cancer rate is reported for Belgium with a 191.8 per 100 000 females (Ferlay et al., 
2018). Assuming a 1:1 male: female ratio, the prevalence for the total population is 95.9 per 100 000. 
In addition, HER2-positive breast cancers have been demonstrated to account for 15-20% of all breast 
cancer sub-types (Wolff et al., 2013). On the basis of this the Fpen is calculated as 95.9/100 000 x 0.2 
= 0.000192. With this refined Fpen the PECsw is calculated as 0.00092 µg/L.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The mechanism of action of Enhertu, as a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate, which after binding 
to HER2 undergoes internalization and intracellular linker cleavage of the deruxtecan part by lysosomal 
enzymes, that are upregulated in cancer cells, causing DNA damage and apoptotic cell death, has been 
demonstrated to a high extent in vitro. However, the process of linker cleavage is written in less detail. 
Okamoto et al (2020) showed the results of the exposure of the tissues of KPL-4 tumour-bearing mice 
to released DXd (deruxtecan, MAAA-1181a) after a single iv administration of T-DXd (Enhertu) or non-
targeted control ADC. This indicates the proof of principal; the majority of MAAA-1181a (ca. 80%) is 
delivered in the tumor. This means that ca. 20% of MAAA-1181a is exposed to other tissues in this 
model, but is relatively quickly removed from the body (t1/2 was fond 1.35 h). However, a detailed 
process of cleavage and the observed discrepancies in some animal studies related to the DAR and 
HER2 occupation could not be explained. Altogether, it is clear that there is very likely some exposure 
to free MAAA-1181a in the human system, which should be taken into account in the toxicological 
characterization of the product. 
Results in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of breast cancer suggest that DS-8201a is effective 
even in T-DM1 refractory HER2-expressing breast cancer tumours due to the drug-linker system with a 
different mechanism of action. However, it is unexpected that DS-8201a has a clear, although not 
significant, lesser effect than MAAL-9002b which has a two times lower drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) in 
the HER2-positive CTG-0708 model. This is not seen in the HER2-low model. Furthermore, when the 
HER2-positive and HER2-low xenografts are compared, it is noted that DS-8201a has a more robust 
antitumor activity in the HER2-low model. This is also unexpected, since the antibody part of DS-8201a 
binds specifically to HER2.  
In the HER2-positive breast cancer cell line JIMT-1, derived from a trastuzumab-resistant patient and 
known to be refractory to T-DM1, DS-8201a at 3 and 10 mg/kg, T-DM1 at 10 mg/kg, and MAAL-9002b 
at 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumour growth by 64%, 85%, 35%, and 66%, respectively. So, in 
this model the high DAR of DS-8201a results in higher efficacy, because MAAL-9002b showed a lower 
effect than DS-8201a. 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted. However, according to ICH S9, 
understanding the secondary pharmacodynamic properties of a pharmaceutical could contribute to the 
assessment of safety for humans, and those properties might be investigated as appropriate. The 
Applicant considers secondary pharmacodynamic studies not necessary, because sufficient information 
is known from the other studies and of other topoisomerase inhibitors as well. However, MAAA-1181a 
is a new active substance, and probably, there is some exposure to the human system. It would be 
informative to know whether MAAA-1181a can bind to other targets, which could explain secondary or 
toxic effects observed, or predict other secondary or toxic effects not seen thus far in animal studies or 
clinical trials. Therefore, the Applicant is recommended to perform a secondary pharmacodynamic 
study post-marketing. 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been conducted since this application is for use of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan as monotherapy. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The in vivo pharmacokinetic studies with DS-8201a (trastuzumab deruxtecan) were conducted via 
intravenous (IV) injection, as this is the intended route of administration in humans, in rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys, which were used for toxicology studies. From the pharmacokinetic point of view, 
the cynomolgus monkey was the most relevant species for non-clinical efficacy and safety studies. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 57/210 
 
 
 
 
Absorption, tissue distribution and excretion were consistent with what is known for monoclonal 
antibodies. The drug part of DS-8201a, the topoisomerase I inhibitor MAAA-1181a, was found in 
plasma of rats or monkeys but as <1% and, given its pharmacokinetic behaviour, its clearance is 
suggested to be dependent on release from the conjugate. The excretion of MAAA-1181a was found to 
be mainly via the biliary/faecal route as unchanged MAAA-1181a. 
Toxicology 
In animals, toxicities were observed in lymphatic and haematopoietic organs, intestines, kidneys, 
lungs, testes and skin following the administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan at exposure levels of the 
topoisomerase I inhibitor (DXd) below clinical plasma exposure. In these animals, antibody-drug 
conjugate (ADC) exposure levels were similar or above clinical plasma exposure.  
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed that trastuzumab deruxtecan was tolerated in both rats 
and cynomolgus monkey at clinically relevant exposures as well as at higher exposures. Most of the 
toxicities observed, could be attributed to the drug moiety (deruxtecan, MAAA-1181a). Target organs 
and tissues of toxicity were identified to be intestines, lymphatic/haematopoietic system, lungs 
(cynomolgus monkey only), kidneys, skin, testes, incisor teeth (rat only). When the drug moiety 
MAAA-1181a was administered alone; ocular toxicity, liver toxicity and cardiotoxicity were observed, at 
exposure multiples of 14-fold the human AUC (based on cynomolgus monkey) (see SmPC section 5.3). 
The observed toxicities in non-clinical studies after administration of DS-8201a are explained as the 
consequence of the presence of free deruxtecan. Nevertheless, the presence of HER2 in parenchymal 
cells of the lung may have an important role in the processes leading to inflammatory changes and 
interstitial lung toxicity, however, the precise mechanisms are unclear. 
Considering that toxicity is likely related to continuous exposure to deruxtecan after treatment with 
trastuzumab deruxtecan, and clinical deruxtecan plasma exposures exceed plasma exposures in 
animals at the NOAEL, the observed toxicities in cynomolgus monkeys are potential safety concerns 
(see also Clinical Safety section). Intestinal, lymphatic/haematopoietic, pulmonary, skin, renal and 
testicular toxicity have been addressed in the RMP.  
During development, the production of the antibody moiety was changed, and a Process 1 and Process 
2 antibody and subsequent ADC was examined. Both comparative PK studies were performed, some of 
the in vivo studies were performed with process 2 ADC, as well as two of the pivotal toxicity studies in 
cynomolgus monkey. Hence, the change in production of the antibody moiety is considered to be 
sufficiently characterised and Process 2 is sufficiently well described and tested from a nonclinical point 
of view.  
DXd was clastogenic in both an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay and an in vitro Chinese 
hamster lung chromosome aberration assay and was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse 
mutation assay. The positive signal in the in vivo and in vitro mammalian cell assays, is considered to 
be clinically relevant. Genotoxicity to mammalian cells is a known characteristic of topoisomerase I 
inhibitors. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with trastuzumab deruxtecan. This is, according to 
the ICH S9 guideline, not needed for advanced cancer indications, which the current MAA proposed 
indication indeed is considered to be. 
Dedicated fertility studies have not been conducted with trastuzumab deruxtecan. Based on results 
from general animal toxicity studies, trastuzumab deruxtecan may impair male reproductive function 
and fertility.

There were no animal reproductive or developmental toxicity studies conducted with trastuzumab 
deruxtecan. Based on results from general animal toxicity studies, trastuzumab deruxtecan and DXd 
were toxic to rapidly dividing cells (lymphatic/haematopoietic organs, intestine, or testes), and DXd 
was genotoxic, suggesting the potential for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity. The absence of 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies is in line with ICH S9, because MAAA-1181a is 
genotoxic and targets rapidly dividing cells. Moreover, trastuzumab was shown to cause developmental 
toxicity. It is therefore very likely that DS-8201a will also cause embryo-foetal damage in the clinic. 
This is further mentioned in the RMP (as important identified risk) and SmPC. Specifically, in SmPC 
section 4.6, the effective contraception is recommended for at least 7 months in treated females and 
at least 4 months in treated males. The times specified are based on the half-life of trastuzumab of 5.7 
days, and consequently the washout period for males and females after cessation of therapy with 
trastuzumab deruxtecan were specified to a period of 4 months (5 half-lives plus 3 months) and a 
period of 7 months (5 half-lives plus 6 months), respectively. 
For breastfeeding, the washout of 7 months was suggested, however, a shorter period of only 5 half-
lives should actually be sufficient. However, as the product information of previously approved 
products (trastuzumab (t½ 13-27 days) or trastuzumab emtansine (t½ 4 days)), suggest 7 months 
waiting period, the same wording is used in the present product. Furthermore, an additional 
precautionary wording and recommendation on counselling on sperm storage prior to initiating 
treatment has been included in section 4.6 of the SmPC. This is based on a further discussion on the 
findings on sperm in rat and cynomolgus monkey was presented. When comparing DS-8201a plasma 
levels, the non-recovering findings in rats were observed at approximately 26-fold the MHRD, whereas 
at lower doses (9-fold MHRD), the findings were less severe and mostly appeared reversible. However, 
when deruxtecan plasma levels are compared testicular toxicity was observed in animals at plasma 
levels below human therapeutic plasma levels. 
Environmental risk assessment 
The Environmental assessment report provided by the applicant consisted of a justification for 
performing ERA assessment for the drug moiety of the ADC, as the antibody and linker are of biological 
origin, and expected to be metabolised to peptides and amino acids in the body. This is supported. 
With regards to the drug-part of the ADC, MAAA-1181a is considered not to be PBT, nor vPvB. A risk to 
the STP, surface water, groundwater, sediment and terrestrial compartment is not anticipated based 
on the prescribed use of Enhertu. Furthermore, the refining the Fpen resulted in a PECsurfacewater 
below the trigger value, and the LogKow was also below the limit of 4.5. Due to this, no further 
environmental studies were performed. This is supported.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that trastuzumab 
deruxtecan show anti-tumour activity against both HER2 positive and HER2 low cancer models. The 
pharmacokinetic programme was considered sufficient. Toxicology studies showed that trastuzumab 
deruxtecan was tolerated in both rats and cynomolgus at clinically relevant as well as higher 
exposures.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Overall, results from 5 studies are presented in the Clinical pharmacology section: four Phase 1 clinical 
studies in subjects with breast cancer and other solid malignant tumors and one Phase 2 clinical study 
in breast cancer subjects as well as a popPK analysis and exposure-response analysis. 
The intended commercial drug product (Lyo-DP) was used in the Phase 2 study (Study DS8201-A-
U201) and in Studies DS8201-A-J102, DS8201-A-A103, and DS8201-A-A104. Two other drug products 
were used in development: frozen liquid drug product (FL-DP) 1 and FL-DP2. FL-DP1 was used in 
Study DS8201-A-J101 and FL-DP2 was used in Studies DS8201-A-J101 and DS8201-A-U201. The 
transition from FL-DP1 to FL-DP2 included changes to the manufacturing process for drug substance 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021

and drug-linker, and cell line and process change for mAb; the only difference between the 
formulations of FL-DP2 and Lyo-DP is that FL-DP2 was supplied frozen and Lyo-DP is lyophilized. 
Analytical methods 
Three drug product (DP) dosage forms of trastuzumab deruxtecan have been used across the clinical 
development program: the first two DPs were frozen-liquid DPs (FL-DP) and the last one is lyophilized 
powder drug product (Lyo-DP) which is the to-be-marketed formulation of trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
Three analytes were measured in the development program: trastuzumab deruxtecan (the intact ADC), 
total anti-HER2 antibody, and MAAA-1181a (the topoisomerase I inhibitor). 
PK properties of FL-DP1, FL-DP2, and Lyo-DP formulations of trastuzumab deruxtecan were compared 
using data from two clinical studies. 
The analytical comparability program to establish the comparability of trastuzumab deruxtecan DS 
manufactured by DS Process-1 and DS Process-2a included an evaluation of both MAAL-9001, which 
involved a cell line change, and of the changes in D-L manufacturing process.  
The impact of the dosage form change from FL-DP2 to Lyo-DP on the quality of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan DP was evaluated by an analytical comparability exercise, and no differences that may 
potentially impact on the efficacy and/or safety were observed. 
Bioanalysis was conducted to determine the serum concentrations of three moieties associated with 
trastuzumab deruxtecan: concentrations of the intact drug, trastuzumab deruxtecan; concentrations of 
total anti-HER2 antibody were determined in an assay that detected the sum of MAAL-9001 and 
trastuzumab deruxtecan; and concentrations of the released payload, MAAA-1181a. Antidrug 
antibodies (ADAs) against trastuzumab deruxtecan were also determined. 
The bioanalytical methods utilized electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays for trastuzumab deruxtecan, 
total anti-HER2 antibody, and anti-trastuzumab deruxtecan antibodies, and liquid chromatography 
coupled with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS) for MAAA-1181a.  
An assay measuring concentrations of intact trastuzumab deruxtecan in human serum, using an ECL 
method, was developed and validated at CRO PPD. Trastuzumab deruxtecan was analyzed over the 
nominal concentration range of 0.400 to 25.6 μg/mL.  
An assay measuring concentrations of total anti-HER2 antibody in human serum using an ECL method 
was developed and validated at CRO PPD. Total anti-HER2 antibody was analyzed over the nominal 
concentration range of 0.400 to 25.6 μg/mL.  
An assay measuring MAAA-1181a (topoisomerase inhibitor component of DS-8201a) concentrations in 
human serum using a stable-labelled internal standard was developed utilizing protein precipitation 
and quantification using LC-MS/MS. MAAA-1181a was analyzed over the nominal concentration range 
of 10.0 to 2000 pg/mL.  
An assay to detect and confirm anti-trastuzumab deruxtecan antibodies (anti-DS-8201a antibodies) in 
human serum using an ECL method in a multi-tiered approach was developed and validated. 
Biomarker analysis was performed by measurement of HER-2/neu in serum. The ADVIA Centaur® 
HER-2/neu assay (Siemens ADVIA Centaur HER-2/neu [H2n]) was a fully automated Food and Drug 
Administration-approved, 2-site sandwich immunoassay that used direct, chemiluminescent 
technology.

PopPK analysis 
The popPK analysis was composed of two models: intact DS-8201a model and released drug (MAAA-
1181a) model. Data from 5 studies were included in the model development. 
The PK of intact DS-8201a was described by a two-compartment model with linear elimination. 
Clearance was estimated to be 0.421 L/day; central and peripheral volumes of distribution were 
estimated to be 2.77 and 5.16 L respectively. However, non-compartmental analyses comparing cycle 
3 with cycle 1 suggested time-varying pharmacokinetics of intact DS-8201a the elimination half-life 
was longer in cycle 3 compared to cycle 1. A time varying clearance has been described regularly for 
antibodies in oncology setting (Wilkins et al. 2019, Liu et al. 2017, Li et al. 2017). The popPK model of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan did not include time-varying clearance. The Applicant provided new 
information about the incorporation of time independent CL in the PopPK. In this analysis, Applicant 
detailed the time-varying clearance of MAAA-1181a and time-independent clearance of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan by VPC plots and residual plots stratified by cycle. The conclusion of the applicant are not 
fully supported; the VPC plots and the residual plots stratified by cycle indicated that the clearance of 
MAAA-1181a is underestimated in the first cycle and that the model predicted the pharmacokinetics of 
MAAA-1181a better at the third cycle although the variability is overestimated. For both trastuzumab 
deruxtecan as well as MAAA-1181a, in the first cycle the initial clearance during the first 4 days is 
underestimated which is not apparent at the third cycle. It may be hypothesized that effect of baseline 
tumour size has more impact on the clearance of trastuzumab deruxtecan the first few days after the 
first administration compared to repeated administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan. The PK of the 
released drug is described by a time-varying one-compartment model, with intact DS-8201a as an 
input. Clearance was estimated to be 19.9 L/h, a volume of distribution 17 L/m2, and a release rate of 
0.0167 h. The variability was overestimated, and shrinkage of clearance was rather high, i.e. 37.8%  
in the final model of MAAA-1181a compared to 25.4% in the base model.

Absorption  
Based on non-compartmental analysis from 5 studies (DS8201-A-J101, DS8201-A-J102, DS8201-A-
A103, DS8201-A-A104, and DS8201-A-U201) Tmax of DS8201a was approximately 2 hours, whereas 
Tmax of the MAAA-1181a was approximately 6.8 hours. 
Bioavailability 
The dose of MAAA-1181a (released drug) was unknown, as the drug was not directly administered. In 
the popPK analysis, each 1000 mg of DS-8201a was modelled to release 3.33 mg of MAAA-1181a upon 
deconjugation (the ratio of approximately 500/150000 is according to molecular weight). DX-8951f has 
a molecular weight of 568 g/mol, and trastuzumab has a molecular weight of 146000 g/mol. 
Additionally, the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) for DS-8201a is approximately 8. 
Bioequivalence 
No dedicated bioequivalence studies were conducted. Three drug products were used during the clinical 
development process: FL-DP1 (DS-8201a for injection 50 mg/2.5 mL used in Study DS8201-A-J101), 
FL-DP2 (DS-8201a for injection 100 mg/5 mL used in studies DS8201-A-J101 and DS8201-A-U201) 
and Lyo-DP (intended commercial drug product used in studies DS8201-A-U201, DS8201-A-J102, 
DS8201-A-A103, and DS8201-A-A104). 
PK comparison of FL-DP1 and FL-DP2 was performed in clinical Study DS8201
A-J101, while PK 
comparison after administration of FL-DP2 and Lyo-DP was conducted in Study DS8201
‑
addition, the effects of different drug products were evaluated in PopPK analysis.

A PK comparison across formulations and DPs was also performed using integrated data from 
subjects with HER2-expressing advanced or metastatic breast cancer across Study DS8201 A J101 
(Parts 2a, 2c, and 2e) and Study DS8201 A U201. 
Study DS8201-A-J101 
This was a Phase 1, 2-part (Dose Escalation followed by Dose Expansion), multicenter, nonrandomized, 
open-label, multiple-dose, first-in-human study of DS-8201a. Study design schema is presented below. 
Two types of DS-8201a drug product, FL-DP1 and FL-DP2, were used in this study. 
FL-DP1 drug product was used for the Dose Escalation phase and for Dose Expansion Parts 2a, 
2b, 2c, and 2d, whereas FL-DP2 drug product was used for Dose Expansion Part 2e. PK analysis set 
included all subjects who received at least one dose of DS-8201a and had measurable serum 
concentrations of DS-8201a.

Study DS8201
A-U201 
This was a phase 2, open-label, multicenter, 2-part study designed to justify the recommended dose of 
‑
DS-8201a and investigate the safety and efficacy in subjects with unresectable and/or metastatic 
HER2-positive BC previously treated with T-DM1. Study DS8201-A-U201 design is presented in the 
figure below. Two DP were used during the study FL-DP2 and Lyo-DP.

 Figure 5: DS8201-A-U201 Study Design 
The FL-DP2 DP was used in all subjects randomized in Part 1 PK stage (ie, 22 subjects in the 5.4 
mg/kg dose, 22 subjects in the 6.4 mg/kg dose, and 21 subjects in the 7.4 mg/kg dose cohorts) and 
Part 1 Dose Finding stage (ie, 28 subjects in the 5.4 mg/kg dose and 28 subjects in the 6.4 mg/kg 
dose cohorts).  In Part 2 (5.4 mg/kg dose), 108 subjects received the Lyo-DP product and 26 subjects 
received the FL-DP2 product. The PK comparison between FL-DP2 and Lyo-DP was conducted using 
RP2D, which was determined to be 5.4mg/kg. The PK comparison was done using Pharmacokinetic 
(PK) Analysis Set, which was determined as all subjects enrolled in Part 1 or Part 2 who received at 
least 1 dose of study drug and had measurable serum concentrations of DS-8201a. The PK sampling 
time points used for the PK comparison are presented in the below tables.

Distribution 
Intact DS-8201a 
From the popPK model Vc of DS-8201a was 2.77L, Vp was 5.16L. Identified covariates on volume of 
distribution in the popPK model was sex and country (Japan, non-Japan). According to the model, male 
subjects had approx. 19% higher Vc, whereas subjects from Japan had a approx. 26% lower Vp. 
MAAA-1181a (Released drug) 
According to MAA, the volume (V) of the released drug was not estimable from the current data, as a 
result it was fixed to 17 L/m2 (literature documented volume of distribution of exatecan mesylate DX-
8951f) multiplied by individual body surface area. Data from popPK indicate that V was greater in older 
subjects and in subjects receiving FL-DP2 (by approx. 26% in comparison with the Lyo-DP 
formulation). V was lower in subjects receiving FL-DP1 (by approx. 21% in comparison with the Lyo-DP 
formulation).  
Protein binding 
Based on in vitro data, the binding of MAAA-1181a to human plasma proteins was 96.8% to 98.0% 
across the concentration range of 10 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL.  
Blood to plasma ratio 
Blood to plasma ratio of MAAA-1181a was also evaluated in vitro, the ratio was 0.59 to 0.62 across the 
concentration range of 10 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL, suggesting that MAAA-1181a distributes easily into red 
blood cells.  
Transporters 
Based on in vitro data, the MAAA-1181a is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, MATE2-K, OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3, BCRP, MRP 1. 
Elimination 
Based on PopPK analysis the clearance of DS-8201a was estimated to be 0.421 L/d, whereas the 
clearance of MAAA-1181a was 19 L/h. Based on non-compartmental analysis across studies, the 
apparent terminal elimination half-life of DS-8201a ranged from 2.2 days to 7.3 days across the 0.8 
mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg dose range, half-life for the 5.4mg/kg dose was 6.03 days. The apparent terminal 
elimination half-life of MAAA-1181a ranged from 2.5 days to 6.45 days across the 0.8 mg/kg to 8.0 
mg/kg dose range, half-life for the 5.4mg/kg dose was 6.11 days. 
Excretion 
The routes and patterns of excretion were not specially investigated in humans. The available data is 
from studies with animals. This data indicates that after IV administration of 14C-labeled MAAA-1181a 
to rats the major excretion pathway of radioactivity was faeces via the biliary route and MAAA-1181a 
was the most abundant component of radioactivity in urine, faeces, and bile. After single IV 
administration of 14C-labelled trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg/kg) to monkeys, radioactivity was 
predominantly excreted into faeces and MAAA-1181a was the most abundant component in urine and 
faeces 
Metabolism 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 72/210 
 
 
 
 
Experiments with CYP-expressing microsomes showed that CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 
were involved in the metabolism of MAAA-1181a. In the experiments using human liver microsomes 
with the specific CYP inhibitors, the inhibition rates were -1.3% for CYP1A2, 3.7% for CYP2B6, 16.3% 
for CYP2C8, -2.9% for CYP2C9, 6.0% for CYP2C19, 8.9% for CYP2D6, and 94.9% for CYP3A4/5. As a 
result, CYP3A4 is the primary CYP isoform involved in the metabolism of MAAA-1181a.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
There were no clinical studies designed specifically to evaluate single doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan 
in human subjects. Dose proportionality of 3 analytes was assessed in a Study DS8201-A-J101. The 
estimation of the slope of the dose proportionality analysis was approximately 1 for both the 0.8-8.0 
mg/kg group and the ≥3.2 mg/kg group for DS-8201a and total anti-HER2 antibody. DS-8201a Cmax 
was dose proportional across the dose range of 0.8 to 8.0 mg/kg. AUClast demonstrated greater-than 
dose- proportional increases across the wide dose range of 0.8 to 8.0 mg/kg but increased dose 
proportionally at doses at or above 3.2 mg/kg. 
Table 7: Dose Proportionality of Total Anti-HER2 Antibody Analysis of Pharmacokinetic 
Parameters of DS-8201a Dose Escalation (PK Analysis Set) 
Estimate of (95% CI) of the slope for AUClast for total anti-HER2 antibody was 1.23 (1.01, 1.46) for 
the 0.8-8.0 mg/kg dose range and 1.50 (1.16, 1.83) for the ≥3.2 mg/kg dose range, which suggest 
greater than the dose-proportional increase for both dose groups (Table 2.1.6.1). Estimation (95% CI) 
of the slope for AUClast for MAAA-1181 was 0.507 (-0.0255, 1.04) for the ≥ 3.2 mg/kg dose range, 
due to the constant exposure over 5.4 mg/kg (below table).

Time dependency 
Time dependency of trastuzumab deruxtecan was evaluated in Study DS8201-A-J102 in Cycle 1 and 
Cycle 3. Following IV administration of DS-8201a at 6.4 mg/kg, the Cmax for MAAA-1181a was 
reached with a median Tmax of 6.93 hours at Cycle 1 (n = 51) and 6.92 hours at Cycle 3 (n = 37). At 
Cycle 1, the mean Cmax for MAAA-1181a was 12.6 ng/mL and the mean AUCtau was 39.0 ng•d/mL. 
At Cycle 3, the mean Cmax for MAAA-1181a was 9.60 ng/mL and the mean AUCtau was 41.5 
ng•d/mL; the mean AR for AUCtau at Cycle 3 was 1.09. Steady state was reached at Cycle 3 (see 
figure below).

Time to steady state was evaluated using the observed Cmin (trough concentration) data using the 
PopPK dataset. Based on the observed Cmin by cycle (Figure below) trastuzumab deruxtecan appeared 
to have reached steady state by Cycle 3.

Cmin = minimum observed serum concentration; IQR = interquartile range. 
Note: Individual observed trastuzumab deruxtecan concentrations in the 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg dose groups within the first 8 
treatment cycles from the final population PK analysis dataset were used. Some outlying data points with extreme values were 
excluded to allow better visualization of the observed concentration range in each cycle and dose group. Boxes represent quartiles 
and whiskers represent 1.5 IQR. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In the popPK analysis, interindividual variability for DS-8201a clearance was 25.1%, for distribution 
clearance 30%, for central and peripheral volumes of distribution was 15.8% and 65.6% respectively. 
Interindividual variability for MAAA-1181a clearance was 25.4%, volume of distribution 42%, release 
rate 37.6%.  
The Applicant was asked to provide data regarding intrasubject variability. The model estimated a 
proportional residual error (intrasubject variability) of 27.9% (as CV%) for the observed MAAA-1181a 
concentrations. The proportional residual error (intrasubject variability) was estimated to be 16.3% (as 
a CV%) for intact trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
The effect of renal impairment on the exposure of DS-8201a and MAAA-1181a was evaluated using 
CrCL as a covariate in the PopPK analysis. Normal function, mild impairment, moderate impairment, 
and severe impairment were defined as CrCL (using Cockroft and Gault equation) of ≥90, 60 to 89, 30 
to 59, and 15 to 29 mL/min, respectively.  
Summary of post-hoc MAAA-1181a exposures in breast cancer subjects with 5.4 mg/kg DS-8201a 
Q3W dosing, comparison in renal function subgroups is presented in below table. A post hoc 
comparison of exposures showed approx. 10% lower exposures of MAAA-1181a between subjects with 
mild renal impairment (N = 206) and subjects with normal renal function (N = 238) (see figure below). 
Moderate and severe renal impartment showed no apparent change in exposure of MAAA-1181a, 
although this was based on only 58 subjects (57 subjects with moderate renal impairment and 1

subject with severe renal impairment). The Applicant states that, based on the PopPK analysis, no dose 
adjustment is recommended for subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment. Limited data 
preclude a recommendation for subjects with severe renal impairment.

Impaired hepatic function 
Dedicated hepatic impairment study was not conducted. The effect of hepatic impairment was 
evaluated using hepatic function parameters on clearance and volume of MAAA-1181a in the popPK 
analysis. Baseline AST and baseline total bilirubin were identified as significant covariates on the 
clearance of MAAA-1181a. The increase of AST and total bilirubin results in decreased clearance of 
MAAA-1181a. The effects on clearance resulted in differences in exposure. Subjects with AST of 83 U/L 
(95th percentile) demonstrated 25% higher MAAA-1181a AUC, 24% higher Cmax and 25% higher 
Cmin at steady state compared with subjects with the median AST value of 30 U/L (figure 2.1.8.2). 
Subjects with total bilirubin of 17 μmol/L (95th percentile) demonstrated 17% higher AUC and Cmin, 
and 16% higher Cmax compared with subjects with the median total bilirubin value of 8 μmol/L (figure 
below). For both covariates (AST and total bilirubin), values below median resulted in lower exposure 
of MAAA-1181a. However, the ratios of AUC, Cmin and Cmax remained within the 0.8-1.25 limits 
(figure below).

administered the Lyo-DP formulation of DS-8201a.   
Based on the popPK model, the ratio in exposures between subjects with mild hepatic impairment 
versus normal hepatic function (based on NCI ODWG criteria which based on total bilirubin and AST) 
ranged from 1.03 to 1.11 (table below). There were only 1 subject with moderate and 3 subjects with 
unknown hepatic function. Boxplots of released drug exposure stratified by hepatic function are 
presented in below figure.

subjects; NCI ODWG = National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group; Q3W = every 3 weeks. 1. Comparison of 
exposure between moderate/unknown hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function was not performed because of the very 
limited sample size of breast cancer subjects with moderate/unknown hepatic impairment (N=4). Note: Values were calculated using 
15 significant figures but are presented with rounding to 3 significant figures. Hepatic function was categorized using the NCI ODWG 
criteria.

range of data. Whiskers represent the extent of data within 1.5 times the interquartile range. Points represent data 
outside the whiskers. Hepatic function was categorized using the NCI ODWG criteria. 
Gender 
Gender effects on PK of DS-8201a and MAAA-1181a were evaluated in popPK analysis. Sex was 
identified as a significant covariate for clearance and central volume for DS-8201a. Male subjects had 
19.7% higher central volume and 17.4% higher clearance of DS-8201a. This resulted in reduced 
exposure metrics Cmin, AUC and Cmax compared to typical female subject (see Figure below). 
However, According to MAA, differences between AUC values were not clinically meaningful as the 
decrease in AUC at steady state for males was approximately 15% relative to females. 
Sex was not identified as significant covariate for any covariates tested for MAA-1181a.

subject is defined as a female from a non-Japan country with body weight 57.8 kg, albumin 40 g/L, and baseline tumor size 57 mm.   
Race 
The effect of race on exposure was evaluated using the PopPK analysis and was not identified as a 
significant covariate for either DS-8201a or MAAA-1181a. However, country (Japan versus non-Japan) 
was also evaluated as a covariate in the PopPK analysis and Japan as a country had a statistically 
significant effect on the clearance and peripheral volume of DS-8201a. Clearance of DS-8201a 
decreased with being in Japan (by approx. 9%), and peripheral volume of distribution decreased with 
being in Japan (by approx. 7%). These effects resulted in increased exposure, but did not correspond 
to relative changes in exposure outside the 0.8 to 1.25 limits (ratios of 1.11 for AUC and 1.19 for 
Cmin, see figure 2.1.8.4). Ratio for Cmax was also within the conventional bioequivalence limits (ratio 
of Cmax was 1.02). 
Albumin 
Baseline albumin was evaluated as a covariate in the PopPK analysis. Baseline albumin was identified 
as a significant covariate on the clearance of DS-8201a, indicating decreasing clearance with increasing 
albumin levels. According to the MAA, the effect of baseline albumin on the exposure of DS-8201a was 
not considered clinically meaningful as the 90% CIs of the AUC at steady state ratio was within the 
0.80 to 1.25 range for both subjects with baseline albumin of 31 g/L (5th percentile) and 45 g/L (95th 
percentile) compared with subjects with the median value of baseline albumin of 40 g/L (AUC at steady 
state ratios of 0.87 and 1.06, respectively; see figure 2.1.8.4).

Weight 
Body weight was identified as a significant covariate on clearance for DS8201a and MAAA-1181a in the 
popPK analysis. In both instances the model suggests increasing clearance with increasing body 
weight. However, despite the fact that the effect of baseline body weight on clearance of DS-8201a 
and MAAA-1181a suggests increasing clearance with increasing body weight, the overall effect of 
baseline body weight greater than median is a slight increase in exposure.  
According to popPK analysis, subjects with 86 kg (95th percentile) body weight had an approximately 
28% increase in DS8201a AUC relative to a subject with the median body weight (57.8 kg). Whereas 
for MAAA-1181a, subjects with 86 kg (95th percentile) body weight had an approximately 30% 
increase in AUC, 26% increase in Cmax and 25% increase in Cmin relative to a subject with the 
median body weight (57.8 kg). The ratio of Cmin and Cmax for DS8201a and Cmin for MAAA-1181a 
was in the limits of 0.8-1.25 for all presented percentiles (from 5th to 95th).

Elderly 
The effect of age was assessed in the PopPK analysis. Age was identified as a significant covariate for 
volume of MAAA-1181a. However According to MAA, age did not show a clinically meaningful effect on 
the AUC of MAAA-1181a as the 90% CI of the AUCss ratio was within the 0.8- to 1.25-fold).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Study DS8201-A-A104 was a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single-sequence crossover study of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan designed to evaluate DDI potential of ritonavir (dual inhibitor of 
OATP1B/CYP3A) and itraconazole (strong inhibitor of CYP3A) on trastuzumab deruxtecan and 
MAAA-1181a in 40 subjects (age 57, range 31-80) with HER2-expressing advanced solid malignant 
tumors dosed at 5.4 mg/kg.  
Cohort 1: Ritonavir was dosed at 200 mg twice a day from Day 17 of Cycle 2 until Day 21 of Cycle 3. 
Seventeen (17) subjects were enrolled and 5 subjects were excluded from PK statistics because the 
subjects had missing/incomplete dosing in Cycle 2 and Cycle 3. 
Cohort 2: Itraconazole was dosed at 200 mg twice daily on Day 17 of Cycle 2 followed by 200 mg once 
daily until Day 21 of Cycle 3. Twenty-three (23) subjects were enrolled and 9 subjects were excluded 
from PK statistical analysis because the subject had missing/incomplete dosing in Cycle 2 and Cycle 3.  
AUC0-17d was used as a parameter to evaluate the effect of the inhibitors on the DS-8201a exposure 
instead of AUC0-21d. This was done to prevent delays to dosing of DS-8201a in Cycle 3 (maintaining 
21 day cycle) while also allowing the inhibitors to reach steady state before co-administration. 
Therefore, ritonavir and itraconazole dosing was initiated on Day 17 of Cycle 2, and AUC of DS-8201a

Concomitant use of ritonavir or itraconazole resulted in minimal increases in exposure of MAAA-1181a, 
with increases in AUC17d of 22% and 18%, respectively. Concomitant use of ritonavir or itraconazole 
resulted in minimal increases in exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan, with increases in AUC17d of 
19% and 11%, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
MAAA-1181a as victim 
Metabolism of MAAA-1181a was evaluated with CYP-expressing microsomes (Report AE-8104-G). This 
study showed that a metabolite MAAA-1468a was formed by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 
were involved in the rapid metabolism of MAAA 1181a. Additional experiments in human liver 
microsomes with specific inhibitors of CYP enzymes indicated that CYP3A4 is the primary CYP isoform 
involved in the formation of MAAA-1468a. 
The uptake transport of 14C-MAAA-1181a via OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, 
and MATE2-K was examined using cells expressing each transporter in the presence and absence of 
typical inhibitors (GE-1515-G) or in vesicles MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3 (Report No. DS-23-23Jul2017) or 
in hepatocytes (Report No. TCRM-DMPK-2015-19). The P-gp- and BCRP-mediated transport of 
14C-MAAA-1181a in the presence and absence of typical inhibitors was assessed using Caco-2 cell 
monolayers. The BSEP-mediated transport of 14C-MAAA-1181a with or without adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) was assessed using BSEP-expressing membrane vesicles.  
The transport assays using transporter-expressing cell lines revealed that 14C-MAAA-1181a was a 
substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and MATE2-K. Michaelis constant (Km) and maximum transport rate 
values were 13.3 μmol/L and 252 pmol/mg protein/minute, respectively, for OATP1B1, and 
19.0 μmol/L and 240 pmol/mg protein/minute, respectively, for MATE2-K. For OATP1B3, the uptake 
clearance tended to be saturated at a concentration of 0.3 μmol/L or higher, suggesting that the Km 
was lower than the concentrations tested in this study. Confirmation that MAAA-1181a is a substrate 
for OATP1B transporters was obtained in hepatocytes. In the presence of rifampicin (150 μmol/L), the 
uptake of 14C-MAAA-1181a was reduced, resulting in a 2.29- to 3.13-fold reduction in the CLuptake 
(Report No. TCRM-DMPK-2015-19). MAAA-1181a was a substrate for MRP1 but no marked transport 
via OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MRP2, MRP3 or BSEP was observed. In addition, the P-gp- and 
BCRP-mediated vectorial transport of 14C-MAAA-1181a across Caco-2 cell monolayers was observed. 
In conclusion, MAAA-1181a was found to be a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE2-K, P-gp, 
BCRP, and MRP-1. 
MAAA-1181a as perpetrator 
The inhibitory potential of MAAA-1181a on the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A was investigated using human liver microsomes with or without a 
30-minute preincubation in the presence of MAAA-1181a at concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 
10, and 50 µmol/L. 
The IC50 values of MAAA-1181a for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A 
(testosterone), and CYP3A (midazolam) with and without 30 min preincubation were all estimated to 
be >50 µmol/L, indicating neither reversible nor time-dependent inhibitory effects of MAAA-1181a on 
the activities of any of the CYP isoforms. 
The inhibitory effects of MAAA-1181a (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 µmol/L as MAAA-1181a) on the 
uptake of typical substrates via human OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 86/210 
 
 
 
 
MATE2-K were examined using cells expressing these proteins. The inhibitory effects of MAAA-1181a 
on P-gp and BCRP were assessed using monolayer culture of Caco-2 cells. In addition, the inhibitory 
effect of MAAA-1181a on BSEP was assessed using its expressing vesicles. MAAA-1181a inhibited OAT1 
and OATP1B1 with IC50 values of 12.7 and 14.4 µmol/L, respectively. MAAA-1181a did not inhibit 
OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, P-gp, BCRP, or BSEP (IC50 >30 µmol/L). 
Induction potential of MAAA-1181a was investigated with primary cultures of fresh human hepatocytes 
from 3 donors at concentrations of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 µmol/L. After a 72-hour drug 
exposure, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2B6 mRNA levels and enzyme activities (6β-hydroxytestosterone 
from testosterone for CYP3A4, acetaminophen from phenacetin for CYP1A2, and hydroxybupropion 
from bupropion for CYP2B6) were measured. 
MAAA-1181a, at concentrations of up to 30 µmol/L, did not show any induction potential on mRNA 
expression or induction of metabolic activity of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, or CYP2B6 in human hepatocytes. In 
contrast, MAAA-1181a inhibited mRNA expression and metabolic activity of all three enzymes.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No human PD studies were performed in support of the mechanism of action. Exposure response 
analysis were performed for efficacy and safety based on the clinical studies DS8201-J101, DS8201-
U201, DS8201-J102, DS8201-A103, and DS8201-A104. The effect of trastuzumab deruxtecan on 
Qt/QTc prolongation was investigated in study DS8201-AJ102. 
Primary pharmacology 
Not applicable. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Cardiac effects 
Cardiac effects were assessed in the tQT study DS8201-A-J102, a study conducted in Japan to assess 
the effect of DS-8201a on corrected QT (QTc) interval and its PK in subjects with HER2-expressing 
metastatic and/or unresectable breast cancer, in which the subjects enrolled (n = 51) received the 
higher dose (6,4 mg) of DS-8201a as an IV infusion once Q3W on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. 
Four (7.8%) subjects had TEAEs of ECG QT prolonged, all Grade 1, which were considered to be drug-
related by the investigators and were not classified as a serious TEAE. None of the subjects required 
medication and no action was taken with DS-8201a due to the TEAEs. All subjects recovered and 
continued on study. 
The analysis of the QTcF interval over time was the primary analysis for assessment of the effect of 
DS-8201a on the QTc interval. The results of the analysis indicated that the upper bound of the 90% 
CI for the mean ΔQTcF was below 10 milliseconds at all time points.  A slight increase in the mean 
QTcF interval was observed for up to 7 hours post-dose in both Cycles 1 and 3. However, no QTcF 
prolongation was observed on Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 Day 8 and Day 15.   
Evaluation the mean change in QTcF interval at the mean Cmax values for DS-8201a and MAAA-1181a 
(Table below). The values presented in this table were calculated using the observed mean Cmax for 
each analyte, which was incorporated in the equation for the linear model of concentration vs ΔQTcF 
for Cycle 1 and Cycle 3. The upper bound of the 90% CI for change in QTcF at the observed mean

ΔQTcF at Cycles 1, 2, and 3 (Cardiac Safety Analysis Set) 
ΔQTcF, MAAA-1181a = -4.94 + 0.65*concentration   
Results from the study indicate that trastuzumab deruxtecan 6.4 mg/kg administration was not 
associated with a clinically meaningful (change from baseline >10 ms) corrected QT interval by 
Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) prolongation. The upper bound of the 90% CI for change from baseline in 
QTcF (ΔQTcF) at the observed mean Cmax for each analyte (trastuzumab deruxtecan and MAAA-
1181a) in the linear model of concentration versus ΔQTcF for Cycles 1 and 3 was under 10 ms. 
Interactions 
Possible interaction with OATP1B inhibitors was assessed in the Study A104. No clinically relevant 
changes in the exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan was observed. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
The Applicant has performed PGx in the study A104, however, no analysis was performed due small 
number of patients included. 
Exposure-response analysis 
Exposure-efficacy analysis 
The exposure-efficacy analysis set included efficacy-evaluable subjects with HER2-positive breast 
cancer in Studies J101 and U201 that were also included in the population PK analysis.  
The exposure-efficacy analysis set comprised 337 HER2-positive breast cancer subjects, including 106 
subjects from Study J101 and 231 subjects from Study U201. 
Individual post-hoc Bayes estimates of PK parameters of intact DS-8201a and released drug were used 
to compute exposure metrics after a single dose (maximum concentration [Cmax], minimum 
concentration [Cmin], area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) or at steady state (Cmax,

Cmin, AUC), or average concentration to the time of the event (accounting for any dose reductions or 
dose interruptions).  
Exposure-safety analysis  
There was a total of 645 subjects who were evaluable for safety. As a sensitivity analysis, the 
exposure-safety analysis for ILD was repeated amongst subjects from J101 and U201, to confirm 
robustness of the results.  
Individual posthoc Bayes estimates of PK parameters of intact DS-8201a and released drug were used 
to compute exposure metrics at Cycle 1 (Cmax, Cmin, AUC), steady-state (Cmax, Cmin, AUC), or 
average concentration to the end of the cycle in which the event occurred (accounting for dose 
reductions or dose interruptions).

There was a trend towards increased confirmed central ORR with increasing intact DS-8201a exposures 
but not with released drug exposures. The only relationship that achieved statistical significance was for

cycle during which event occurred for both trastuzumab deruxtecan and MAAA-1181a, as described. 
The exposure metric, that demonstrated the most significant relationship with the ORR, was intact 
Cavg. The was a similar trend for Cmin, but statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.174). 
Similar trend was observed with released drug Cavg and CminSS.

Complete analyses for E-R-A for efficacy. Exposure parameters used in the ER analysis for efficacy 
are provided in a selected manner. This approach is not clear and the Applicant should provide ORR

concentrations. None of the tested covariates, including body weight, sex, race, tumor size, and others 
had statistically significant relationship with the efficacy endpoints.  
Exposure-Safety Analyses 
The ER analyses for safety were conducted using a combined dataset from 5 clinical studies (DS8201-
A-J101, DS8201-A-J102, DS8201-A-A103, DS8201-A-A104, and DS8201-U201) and included the 
following safety endpoints: 
(1) discontinuation associated with AEs; (2) dose reduction associated with AEs; (3) dose interruption 
associated with AEs; (4) AEs of ≥ Grade 3; (5) SAEs; (6) anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia;

severity grades derived using CTCAE grading criteria; (7) AESIs, ie, ILD/pneumonitis and decreased 
LVEF; severity grades derived using CTCAE grading criteria. 
A number of patient-specific covariates were evaluated for their impact on ER relationship, including 
country (Japan, non-Japan Asia, non-Japan Other), age, sex, race (Asian, White, African American, 
other, unknown), HER2 status (positive, negative, unknown), ECOG PS (0 versus 1 or greater), lung 
metastases (present versus absent), number of prior non-hormonal cancer therapies ≥6, and baseline 
platelets, hemoglobin, and neutrophils. 
Results 
LVEF AEs based on AE data were too few for formal exposure-response analysis, so LVEF events based 
on ECHO data and CTCAE criteria were used instead. Because CTCAE criteria do not define a grade 
level of one for LVEF reduction, and there were only three events of Grade ≥3, Grade ≥2 by ECHO 
LVEF decrease was analysed as an endpoint.  
A combined race-country covariate was used instead of separate race and country categories to reduce 
confounding and to capture key differences. In total, there were 310 Asians in Japan, 84 Asians not in 
Japan, and 245 non-Asians.  
All AEs analysed showed an exposure-response relationship.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The Applicant presented popPK analysis which was composed of two models: intact DS-8201a model 
and released drug (MAAA-1181a) model. Data from 5 studies were included in the model development. 
The PK of intact DS-8201a was described by a two-compartment model with linear elimination. The PK 
of the released drug is described by a time-varying one-compartment model, which presented 
discrepancies.   The Applicant also provided results of the tested simultaneous 2-analyte model. The 
simultaneous 2-analyte model provided similar parameter estimates compared to current model, with 
a slightly lower OFV value. However, the differences between the current released drug model and the 
simultaneous 2 analyte model are considered minor, as a result, the current structural model is 
considered acceptable. 
The popPK models are able to predict individual trastuzumab deruxtecan and MAAA-1181a exposures 
adequately and are fit for the purposes of PopPK and exposure-response analyses.  
Distribution 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the volume of distribution of the central compartment 
(Vc) of trastuzumab deruxtecan and topoisomerase I inhibitor, DXd, were estimated to be 2.77 L and 
27.4 L, respectively. 
In vitro, the mean human plasma protein binding of DXd was approximately 97%. 
In vitro, the blood to plasma concentration ratio of DXd was approximately 0.6. 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan undergoes intracellular cleavage by lysosomal enzymes to release the DXd 
(see Discussion on non-clinical pharmacology). The humanised HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody is 
expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same 
manner as endogenous IgG. In vitro metabolism studies in human liver microsomes indicate that DXd 
is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 via oxidative pathways. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following intravenous administration of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, the clearance of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan was estimated to be 0.42 L/day and the clearance of DXd was 19.2 L/h. In cycle 3, the 
apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) of trastuzumab deruxtecan and released DXd was approximately 
7 days. Moderate accumulation (approximately 35% in cycle 3 compared to cycle 1) of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan was observed. 
Based on non-compartmental analysis Tmax of DS8201a was approximately 2 hours, whereas Tmax of 
the MAAA-1181a was approximately 6.8 hours. 
In vitro interactions 
Effects of Enhertu on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
In vitro studies indicate DXd does not inhibit major CYP450 enzymes including CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6 and 3A. In vitro studies indicate that DXd does not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, P-gp, BCRP, or BSEP transporters. 
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of Enhertu 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021

In vitro, DXd was a substrate of P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE2-K, MRP1, and BCRP.  
No clinically meaningful interaction is expected with medicinal products that are inhibitors of MATE2-K, 
MRP1, P-gp, OATP1B1, or BCRP transporters (see section 4.5). 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan and released DXd when administered intravenously increased 
in proportion to dose in the 3.2 mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg dose range (approximately 0.6 to 1.5 times the 
recommended dose) with low to moderate inter-subject variability. Based on population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, inter-subject variability in trastuzumab deruxtecan and DXd elimination 
clearances was approximately 25% and for central volume of distribution was approximately 16% and 
42%, respectively. The intra-subject variability in trastuzumab deruxtecan and DXd AUC values (area 
under the serum concentration versus time curve) was approximately 8% and 14%, respectively. 
Special populations 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age (23-96 years), race, ethnicity, sex and body weight 
did not have a clinically meaningful effect on exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan or released DXd. 
Elderly 
The population PK analysis showed that age (range: 23-96 years) did not affect the PK of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan. 
Renal impairment 
No dedicated renal impairment study was conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis 
including patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥ 60 and <90 mL/min) or moderate 
(CLcr ≥ 30 and <60 mL/min) renal impairment (estimated by Cockcroft-Gault), the pharmacokinetics 
of the released DXd was not affected by mild or moderate renal impairment as compared to normal 
renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dedicated hepatic impairment study was conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, 
the impact of changes on pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with total bilirubin 
≤ 1.5 times ULN, irrespective of AST level, is not clinically meaningful. There are insufficient data for 
patients with total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times ULN, irrespective of AST level, to draw conclusions, and no 
data is available for patients with total bilirubin > 3 times ULN, irrespective of AST level (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
The routes and patterns of excretion were not specifically investigated in humans. The Applicant was 
asked to discuss whether findings from animal studies, which suggest that majority of the MAAA-1181a 
is excreted unchanged in faeces, could be extrapolated to humans. Metabolism of MAAA-1181a by 
CYP3A4 into metabolite MAAA-1468a was suggested to be an important elimination pathway. This 
would suggest a different fate of MAAA-1181a in human compared to animal species and this would 
limit the use of PK/excretion and safety data obtained in animals to extrapolate to the human situation. 
It was argued that even if the CYP3A was identified to be the primary CYP enzyme metabolizing MAAA-
1181a, it was not the primary elimination pathway for MAAA-1181a in humans, since the DDI study 
showed around 20% increase in MAAA-1181a AUC values and did not change the elimination half-life. 
During in vitro studies with human liver microsomes, one metabolite was identified (MA-1468a, 
product of CYP3A metabolism). However, the concentration of the metabolite accounted for <1,5% of 
the parent compound concentration. The MA-1468a was not identified in studies with cryopreserved 
CHMP assessment report

hepatocytes. The Applicant is recommended to conduct additional study using liver microsomes from 
other species in order to investigate the inconsistency observed in metabolism between the in vitro 
human liver microsomes versus cryopreserved hepatocyte studies and in vivo studies. The results of 
the study are expected to be available by June 2021.  
After single dose ranging from 0.8 mg/kg to 8.0 kg/kg administration, Cmax increased dose-
proportionally for trastuzumab deruxtecan, total anti-HER2 antibody, and MAAA-1181a. Tmax after 
single dose for trastuzumab deruxtecan varied from 1.95 to 4.12 hours, and was longer in 1.6 and 3.2 
mg/kg doses. Tmax was more consistent for MAAA-1181a, approximately 6 hours. AUCinf increased in 
a dose proportionate manner with increasing dose for the trastuzumab deruxtecan and total anti-HER2 
antibody, and for the MAAA-1181a, the AUCinf increased dose-proportionally up to 5.4 mg/kg dose, 
than at the 6.4 mg/kg dose decreased to 34.4 ng·d/mL, and with higher dose of 8.0 mg/kg increased 
to 44.5 ng·d/mL. Nevertheless, it is deemed that the dose-proportionality is maintained.  
The exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan and released DXd when administered intravenously increased 
in proportion to dose in the 3.2 mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg dose range (approximately 0.6 to 1.5 times the 
recommended dose) with low to moderate inter-subject variability. Based on population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, inter-subject variability in trastuzumab deruxtecan and DXd elimination 
clearances was approximately 25% and for central volume of distribution was approximately 16% and 
42%, respectively. The intra-subject variability in trastuzumab deruxtecan and DXd AUC values (area 
under the serum concentration versus time curve) was approximately 8% and 14%, respectively. 
Data on Cl for total anti-HER2 antibody and MAAA-1181a are lacking. Clearance was decreasing with 
increasing doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan. However, no clearance data is suggested for the parts of 
the ADC: total anti-HER2 antibody and MAAA-1181a. The Applicant presented the clearance values for 
total anti-HER2 antibody, pooling the data from studies DS8201-A-J101, DS8201-A-J102, DS8201-A-
A103, DS8201-A-A104, and DS8201-A-U201. The clearance of anti-HER2 antibody (trastuzumab) is 
decreasing with increasing dose, but the limiting factor for comparison is small number of patients in 
the lower doses’ groups. The clearance of MAAA-1181a based on popPK analysis was 19.2 L/h (460.8 
L/day). The MAAA-1181a was not administered by itself in any clinical studies, and no mass balance 
study was performed in humans. 
Steady state was achieved in approximately 42 days. Following administration of 6.4 mg/kg dose, the 
AUCtau of trastuzumab deruxtecan in the Cycle 3 was 35% higher than in Cycle 1.   
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age (23-96 years), race, ethnicity, sex and body weight 
did not have a clinically meaningful effect on exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan or released DXd. 
No dedicated renal impairment study was conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis 
including patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥ 60 and <90 mL/min) or moderate 
(CLcr ≥ 30 and <60 mL/min) renal impairment (estimated by Cockcroft-Gault), the pharmacokinetics 
of the released DXd was not affected by mild or moderate renal impairment as compared to normal 
renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min). 
As a result, no dose adjustment is recommended for this patient population. Patients with severe renal 
impairment were not included, thus no dosing recommendation could be provided.  
No dedicated hepatic impairment study was conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, 
the impact of changes on pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with total bilirubin 
≤ 1.5 times ULN, irrespective of AST level, is not clinically meaningful. There are insufficient data for 
patients with total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times ULN, irrespective of AST level, to draw conclusions, and no 
data is available for patients with total bilirubin > 3 times ULN, irrespective of AST level (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 100/210 
 
 
 
No dosing recommendations could be provided for subjects with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment. The SmPC reflects that these patients should be monitored carefully (see SmPC section 
4.4).   
Elevated AST and total bilirubin were covariates of MAAA-1181a exposure and higher MAAA-1181a was 
associated with increased incidence of AEs (see discussion on clinical safety). The applicant plans to 
collect PK and safety data in at least 10 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment from ongoing 
clinical studies with trastuzumab deruxtecan and provide an overall assessment of these 10 subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment (see RMP).  
Subjects with body weight of 86kg (95th percentile) have higher exposure values of DS8201a (AUC) 
and MAAA-1181a (AUC and Cmax) compared to typical subject, as the exposure is increased with 
increasing weight. The exposure values obtained by the subjects in 95th percentile fall out of 
conventional bioequivalence limits. However, it was observed in the exposure-response safety analysis, 
that higher body weight (i.e. more than 60 kg) was associated with lower risk of anaemia, any grade 3 
or more AE, and dose reduction associated with AEs, even though there was a clear relationship with 
higher exposures and more safety issues. The exponential factor of body-weight on clearance and 
volume was <0.5, which suggests that flat dosing rather than dosing based on body weight would 
result in lower intersubject variability. Further, the applicant was requested to discuss the therapeutic 
window of trastuzumab deruxtecan and if capping of the dose for subjects with high body weight is 
needed, since the patients in the 75th percentile of concentrations tend to have more SEAs, Grade 3 
AEs and other safety issues. PK simulations for the recommended 5.4 mg/kg dose and a flat dose of 
310 mg (calculated with 5.4 mg/kg multiplied by median body weight) in breast cancer patients 
indicated a similar intersubject variability and similar distributions of all exposure matrices for both 
intact and released drug. Exposures in subjects with body weight >86 kg (95th percentile of body 
weight) were 22% to 30% higher compared to a typical subject (57.8 kg). Rates of all AEs endpoints in 
subjects treated with 5.4 mg/kg trastuzumab deruxtecan weighing > 86 kg were generally similar with 
those in subjects with body weight ≤ 86 kg and ORR rate was slightly higher in subjects with body 
weight >86 kg. Based on these results capping of the dose for subjects with higher body-weight is 
considered not necessary (see SmPC section 4.2). In the exposure-response analyses for safety, the 
majority of subjects with the 75th percentile highest trastuzumab deruxtecan and MAAA-1181a 
concentrations were from the higher dose levels of 6.4 mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg which is likely to explain 
the increased SEAs, Grade 3 AEs and other safety issues in the 75th percentile group.  
DS-8201a dose does not need to be adjusted for albumin level, age, gender, race. Results from popPK 
analysis indicate that race does not influence PK of both DS-8201a or MAAA-1181a, although  some 
effects on clearance and peripheral volume of distribution of DS-8201a were identified in Japanese 
patients.   
Given the information from the nonclinical data, the MAAA-1181a exposure may have increased when 
OATP1B inhibitors are administered concomitantly. To further assess this possible interaction in vivo, 
the Applicant had performed the study DS8201-A-A104 with ritonavir as a double inhibitor of OATP1B 
and CYP3A. Since ritonavir is also a potent CYP3A inhibitor, to clarify the role of OATP1B inhibition, 
Cohort 2 was investigated using itraconazole as probe. Since the MAAA-1181a was not found to be 
UGT substrate, and in vitro or in the rat or monkey no conjugated metabolites of MAAA-1181a were 
detected, the DDI risk through the UGT enzyme is not evaluated.  The exposure of MAAA-1181 
increased by 22% in usage together with ritonavir and 18% in usage with itraconazole. This magnitude 
of increase of AUC is deemed clinically insignificant. However, as the results of the in vitro induction 
assay cannot be interpreted at this moment because too high concentrations of MAAA-1181a were 
used, the in vitro induction study should be repeated with lower, clinically relevant MAAA-1181a 
concentrations. The Applicant is recommended to repeat the in vitro induction assay with lower, 
clinically relevant MAAA-1181a concentrations.

Pharmacodynamics 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) has been investigated in a two-part dose-escalation and dose-
expansion Phase 1 study in Japan (DS8201-A-J101) and in an open-label two-part global Phase 2 
study (DS- 8201-A-U201). Three other Phase 1 studies of DS-8201a (Studies DS8201-A-J102, 
DS8201-A-A103, and DS8201-A-A104) also provide useful safety information for exposure-response 
analysis. Study DS8201-A-J102 was designed to assess DS-8201a potential for QTc prolongation and 
to explore the PK profile of DS-8201a after multiple dosing.   
Trastuzumab deruxtecan at 6.4 mg/kg dose did not result in a positive tQT study. What is notable; 
however, is that there was a positive trend towards increase in the change of QTcF with increasing 
MAAA-1181a concentrations, and at the highest concentrations, the upper bound of the 90% CI 
exceeded 10 ms. Moreover, the study was conducted solely with Japanese subjects. Since the systemic 
exposures of trastuzumab deruxtecan and MAAA-1181a in the QT study (6.4 mg/kg Q3W) are higher 
than those in the intended EU population, including subjects with high body weight, at the 
recommended dosing regimen because of the dose difference (6.4 mg/kg Q3W in the QT study vs. the 
recommended 5.4 mg/kg Q3W in the EU population). Overall, the QTc interval in the intended EU 
population as the upper bound of the 90% CI for ΔQTcF (2.7 ms) at the recommended dose of 5.4 
mg/kg is estimated to be below the 10 ms, the estimated MAAA-1181a exposures for subjects with 
high body weight at 5.4 mg/kg dose are also covered by the exposure values at the 6.4 mg/kg dose 
evaluated in the QT study.  
Exposure-efficacy was evaluated in HER2-positive breast cancer subjects in Studies J101 and U201 for 
ORR, PFS, and DOR.  
For the exposure-efficacy analysis, the Applicant tested the Cmax, Cmin, and AUC after cycle 1 and at 
steady state for both trastuzumab deruxtecan and MAAA-1181a, in addition to Cav up to the end of the 
cycle during which event occurred for both trastuzumab deruxtecan and MAAA-1181a, as described.  
Slope estimates were either very shallow of statistically non-significant (p>0.05), thus revealing that 
candidate exposure markers are not informative for E-R-A associations. None of the tested covariates, 
including body weight, sex, race, tumor size, and others had statistically significant relationship with 
the efficacy endpoints.  
To evaluate exposure-safety relationships in all subjects in Studies J101, J102, A103, A104, and U201 
the following treatment-emergent AEs were selected: (1) discontinuation associated with AEs, (2) dose 
reduction associated with AEs, (3) dose interruption associated with AEs, (4) AEs of Grade ≥3, (5) 
serious AEs, (6) anemia, (7) neutropenia, (8) thrombocytopenia, and AEs of special interest (i.e., (9) 
ILD and decreased (10) LVEF). The Applicant has submitted the data on AEs and ORR for patients (n = 
135) who received reduced doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan. The Applicant argues, that in the 
exposure-response analyses, average concentrations for both intact trastuzumab deruxtecan and 
MAAA-1181a until the dosing cycle of the event (for each safety and efficacy endpoint evaluated in the 
analyses) were evaluated, therefore, no additional exposure-response relationships were presented for 
subgroup with reduced doses. The overall rate of AEs and the efficacy metric (ORR) did not present 
any significant differences between the patients who received full and reduced doses. The Applicant will 
submit additional data from the Phase 3 study, once they are available (see discussion on clinical 
efficacy). 
For the exposure-safety analysis, all safety endpoints, that were evaluated, did show a statistically 
significant (p ≤ 0.05) E-R relationship with at least one of the exposure parameters of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan or MAAA-1181a. Trastuzumab deruxtecan steady-state exposure (AUCss) was a 
statistically significant predictor for (1 ) discontinuation associated with AEs and (7) ILD (any grade), 
trastuzumab deruxtecan Cmax,ss was a statistically significant predictor for ILD ≥Grade 3 and (6) 
CHMP assessment report

decreased LVEF, and MAAA-1181a Cav was a significant predictor for all other evaluated safety 
endpoints. For discontinuations due to AEs, the covariates that were evaluated as significant was race-
country and number of prior therapies. However, it is not unexpected, that discontinuation was higher 
in patients with 6 or more lines of prior therapies (see discussion on clinical safety).   
The probability of dose reduction was higher in the highest quartiles, and significant covariates were 
detected: lower probabilities of dose reduction due to AEs were in patients weighting more than 60 kg, 
having more than 6 lines of previous treatment, and having HER2 receptor status negative or 
unknown. The rate of dose interruption was up to 50.6% in the 4th quartile, and the modelling showed, 
that having more than 6 lines of previous treatment decreases the risk of dose interruption due to AEs. 
For the grade ≥3 AEs, rate of those in the 2nd quartile was 49.4% and increased with increasing Cavg. 
Even though the probability of grade ≥3 AE appeared to increase with increasing released drug 
exposure, the same was lower in subjects with body weight ≥60 kg compared with subjects weighing 
<60 kg. No other covariates were identified.  
Higher ECOG PS score (i.e. 1 or more) was associated with higher probability for SAEs. Higher weight 
was a covariate, predicting lower probability of AE, and for grade 3 anaemia, this was also true for 
higher ECOG PS score (i.e. 1 or more). Low baseline haemoglobin was a clear predictor of 
anaemia,neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.. No statistically significant covariates were identified for 
LVEF decrease; most accurate exposure metrics were Cmax,ss of the intact drug and the Cavg of the 
released drug. For the ILD, both intact drug AUCss and Cmax,ss were the most accurate exposure 
metrics. Only race (Asian-Japan vs Asian-Non-Japan) were identified as significant covariates. Higher 
weight (i.e. > 60 kg) predicted lower risk of dose reduction because of AEs, any grade ≥ 3 AEs, or 
anaemia, but this may well be a reflection of these patients being in a better health state.  
Statistically significant relationships were found for all safety endpoints evaluated (p<0.05), with a 
greater rate of AEs for the 6.4 mg/kg dose group compared to the 5.4 mg/kg dose group.  
Overall, dose-response projections suggested an increase in efficacy (4.6% increase in ORR), but also 
corresponding increases in most AEs, i.e. a dose increase from 5.4 to 6.4 mg/kg increases the 
incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs by 6.9%, the incidence of Grade ≥2 by ECHO LVEF reductions by 4.0%, and 
the incidence of Grade 3 or greater ILD events at 360-d by 1.6%. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK profile of the trastuzumab deruxtecan has been well characterised. Further, the 
Applicant is recommended to conduct additional study using liver microsomes from other species in 
order to investigate the inconsistency observed in metabolism between the in vitro human liver 
microsomes versus cryopreserved hepatocyte studies and in vivo studies. In addition, the Applicant is 
recommended to repeat the in vitro induction assay with lower, clinically relevant MAAA-1181a 
concentrations.

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study DS8201-A-J101 (J101): Phase 1, Two-part, Multicenter, Non-randomized, Open-label, 
Multiple-dose, First-in-human Study of DS-8201a, in Subjects with Advanced Solid Malignant 
Tumors.

Study J101 was a Phase 1, 2-part (Dose Escalation followed by Dose Expansion), multicenter, non-
randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, first-in-human study of trastuzumab deruxtecan, with study 
sites in Japan and the US. The Dose Escalation (Part 1, n=27) was intended to identify the MTD or the 
RP2D of trastuzumab deruxtecan. Part 1 used modified continuous reassessment method with 
escalation with overdose control design with at least 3 subjects evaluable for assessment of dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) per dose level (0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 5.4, 6.4, and 8.0 mg/kg). The subsequent Dose 
Expansion (Part 2) was intended to further assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan at the MTD/RP2D. Part 2 enrolled patients with solid tumors and with human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression including low HER2 levels and HER2 mutation.

Study Participants  
The study included adult patients (≥20 years in Japan, ≥18 years in the USA) with multiple 
advanced/unresectable solid tumors and with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status (PS) of 0 or 1; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50% within 28 days before 
registration; adequate organ function as defined in the protocol within 7 days before registration; 
adequate treatment washout period before registration, as defined in the protocol; able to provide 
written informed consent; willing to provide pre-existing diagnostic or resected tumor samples; and life 
expectancy of ≥3 months.  
Part 1 (Dose Escalation) included patients with pathologically documented advanced/unresectable or 
metastatic breast cancer (BC) or gastric or gastroesophageal (GEJ) adenocarcinoma refractory to or

intolerable with standard treatment, or for which no standard treatment was available. There were no 
requirements regarding HER2-expression. 
Part 2 (Dose Expansion) consisted of 5 cohorts with different tumor diagnosis criteria, including HER2-
expression Of relevance for the current application is cohort 2a, which included patients with: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
pathologically documented advanced/unresectable or metastatic BC 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression (immunohistochemistry 
[IHC]) 3+ or in situ hybridization [ISH]+ (fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] or dual in 
situ hybridization [DISH]) 
refractory to or intolerable with standard treatment, or for which no standard treatment is 
available;  
treated with T-DM1; 
•  measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.  
Patients were included based on local laboratory HER2 testing and confirmed by central laboratory 
testing. 
Patients with clinically active brain metastases, defined as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring 
therapy with steroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms were excluded. Patients with 
treated brain metastases that were no longer symptomatic and who required no treatment with 
steroids may have been included in the study if they had recovered from the acute toxic effect of 
radiotherapy. 
Main exclusion criteria included significant comorbidities (e.g. congestive heart failure, myocardial 
infarction/unstable angina within 6 months, uncontrolled infection). Patients with a history of (non-
infectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected 
ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening were also excluded. 
Treatments 
Patients received trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously on a day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Doses from 
0.8 mg/kg up to 8.0 mg/kg were administered in the dose escalation phase. Dose escalation of 
DS-8201a to determine the MTD/RP2D was guided by the modified continuous reassessment method 
(mCRM) using a Bayesian logistic regression model following the escalation with overdose control 
(EWOC) principle (Neuenschwander et al. 20084).  
Two doses (5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg) were chosen for continued evaluation in the Dose Expansion 
phase in Part 2. Assignment of individual subjects to each dose was performed in sequential blocks of 
months, with subjects assigned to a certain dose based on the time period of enrollment, and efforts 
were made to enroll to both doses equally. 
Two types of drug product, FL-DP1 (part 1 and part 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) and FL-DP2 (part 2e), were 
supplied in this study. 
Treatment continued until there was no longer clinical benefit from therapy, withdrawal of consent, or 
until unacceptable toxicity occurred.

Concomitant treatment 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 strong inhibitors and strong inducers were prohibited. If use of CYP3A4 
inhibitors was unavoidable, treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan should be delayed when possible 
or patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions in case treatment could not be delayed. 
Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors were also inhibited and in case concomitant 
use was unavoidable, the same approach as for CYP3A4 inhibitors was to be followed. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy endpoints: 
•  Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve either 
(confirmed) complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] per RECIST v1.1 
•  Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the sum of the proportion of subjects who achieve CR, 
PR, or stable disease (SD) 
•  Clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the sum of the proportion of subjects who achieve CR, 
PR, or >6 months of SD 
•  Duration of response (DoR) 
Other efficacy endpoints include amongst others percent change in sum of diameters of target lesions 
from baseline to best post-baseline measurement, time to response (TTR) and the time-dependent 
endpoints PFS and OS. 
Safety endpoints: 
Safety endpoints will include DLTs, SAEs, TEAEs, physical examination findings (including ECOG PS), 
vital sign measurements, standard clinical laboratory parameters, ECG parameters, ECHO/MUGA 
findings, and ophthalmologic findings. TEAEs will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE. Dose 
escalation will be determined by the incidence of DLTs. 
Sample size 
For the Dose Expansion part (Part 2), approximately 260 subjects (100 subjects for Part 2a, 
40 subjects for Part 2b, 20 to 40 subjects for Part 2c, 60 subjects for Part 2d and 20 subjects for Part 
2e) will be enrolled. 
Cohort 2a: If target ORR is more than 15% (null hypothesis: ORR ≤ 0.15, alternative hypothesis: ORR 
> 0.15), then the probability of less than 9 responders out of 100 subjects will be less than 5%. The 
probability that more than 21 responders out of 100 subjects (ORR > 21%) are observed will be less 
than 5% under the null hypothesis with ORR ≤ 0.15 but more than 90% under alternative hypothesis 
with ORR = 0.35. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analysis 
Efficacy assessments were based on tumor assessments, using computerized tomography (CT) scan or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (spiral CT scan or MRI with ≤5 mm cuts) performed at screening 
and every 6 weeks in the first 24 weeks after Day 1 of Cycle 1 and thereafter every 12 weeks while the 
subject remained on study drug. 
Efficacy analyses were to be performed on the Enrolled Analysis Set (intent-to-treat, ITT), with 
analyses of ORR, DCR, and CBR also performed on the Response Evaluable Set (at least one dose of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan and measurable tumors by ICR at baseline). Efficacy data from subjects dosed 
CHMP assessment report

at the RP2D in the Dose Escalation phase were pooled with the efficacy data from the corresponding 
tumor type cohorts in the Dose Expansion phase to calculate the overall efficacy estimates. Efficacy 
analyses were performed based on both ICR and investigator review, with ICR-based response rates in 
the Enrolled Analysis Set considered to be the main efficacy variables of interest. 
The best overall response (BOR) of CR/PR was considered to be confirmed only if the criteria were met 
at a subsequent time point (at least 4 weeks from the time a response of CR/PR was first observed). 
Confirmed and unconfirmed BOR were to be summarized descriptively using the number and 
percentage of subjects along with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on Clopper and Peterson 
methods. For ORR, DCR, and CBR, point estimates and 95% exact binomial CIs were to be provided. 
Time-to-event variables including DoR, duration of SD, TTR, PFS, and OS were to be summarized 
descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier method. Kaplan-Meier estimates of median DoR, median duration 
of SD, median PFS, and median OS and the 95% CIs were to be provided. Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS 
and OS were to be presented.  
Subgroup analyses were planned for selected efficacy endpoints by HER2 expression level, prior 
treatments, metastases (location of organ), other evaluable biomarkers, selected demographic and 
baseline characteristics, and tumor type, as appropriate, to assess the homogeneity of the estimate of 
treatment effect. 
Safety analysis 
The primary analysis is to assess the safety and tolerability of trastuzumab deruxtecan in subjects with 
advanced solid malignant tumors and to determine the MTD/RP2D or establish the safety and 
tolerability of the maximum administered dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan. The data cutoff for the 
primary analysis will occur after all subjects have either discontinued the study or the last subject 
enrolled in Part 2 of the study has completed approximately 6 months of study drug treatment.  
Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03. Potential events of interstitial lung disease 
(ILD) were adjudicated by an independent ILD Adjudication Committee. A DLT was defined as any 
TEAE not attributable to disease or disease-related processes that occurred during the DLT evaluation 
period (Day 1 to Day 21 in Cycle 1 of Part 1) and was Grade 3 or above according to NCI CTCAE v4.03, 
with some exceptions that were pre-defined in the protocol. 
The Safety Analysis Set will include all subjects who received at least one dose of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan.  
Results 
Overall, 292 subjects were enrolled in the study at 8 study centers in the United States and 6 study 
centers in Japan.  
Within the dose escalation part including 27 patients, the MTD was not reached up to 8.0 mg/kg as no 
DLTs were observed. Across all doses combined, 40.7% (95% CI: 22.4, 61.2) achieved a confirmed 
ORR by ICR, and 96.3% (95% CI: 81.0, 99.9) achieved disease control. A dose-response for activity 
was observed, with most of the responses PRs and the greatest response to treatment (best percent 
change from baseline in sum of diameters of target lesions) observed in patients treated with 
5.4 mg/kg or higher. Doses of 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg were administered in the dose expansion 
part.

Study disposition 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021

A total of 118 HER2-positive BC subjects were enrolled and assigned to receive 5.4 mg/kg (n=51) or 
6.4 mg/kg of trastuzumab deruxtecan (n=67) based on the dose escalation and dose expansion part.  
A total of 116 subjects received at least 1 dose of 5.4 (n=50) or 6.4 mg/kg (n=66). At DCO, median 
duration of exposure was 8.5 months (range: 0.7-31.0 months) and 9.0 months (range 
1.4-35.0 months) for the 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg dose group, respectively (safety analysis set). 
Study duration was 9.8 months (range: 0.8-30.4 months) and 10.4 months (1.5-34.4 months) for the 
5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg dose group, respectively. For the 5.4 mg/kg dose group, 20% of patients 
were on study treatment at the time of DCO. Most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were 
progressive disease per RECIST (40.0%), AEs (18.0%) and clinical progression per investigator 
(10.0%). For the 6.4 mg/kg dose group, 18.2% of patients were still on study treatment. Most 
common reasons for treatment discontinuation were progressive disease per RECIST (30.3%), AEs 
(33.3%) and clinical progression per investigator (18.2%). 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics 
Recommended dose 5.4 mg/kg: All but one patient were female, median age was 58.0 years 
(range 28-77; 66.7% <65 yrs), 37.3% were white and 52.9% Asian, 58.8% were from the US and 
most patients had an ECOG PS of 0 (64.7%). A total of 43.1% had mild renal impairment and 7.8% 
had moderate renal impairment at baseline. A total of 45.1% had mild hepatic impairment, no patients 
with moderate of severe hepatic impairment were included. 
Median time from initial diagnosis was 73.5 months (range: 15.2-244.5 months). Most patients were 
hormone receptor status positive (HR+, 62.7%; ER+: 60.8% and PR+: 41.2). Lung metastases were 
observed in 37.3% patients, 23.5% had liver metastases, 11.8% had brain metastases and 39.2% had 
bone metastases. Most patients received ≥5 prior cancer regimens (82.4%, median 7; range 2-17) for 
locally advanced/metastatic BC; a total of 98.0% received prior trastuzumab, 84.3% received prior 
pertuzumab and all patients received prior T-DM1. 
Baseline characteristics were in general comparable between dose groups, except for greater 
proportion of Asian subjects in the 6.4 mg/kg group (67.2% vs 52.9%), more patients with positive HR 
status (74.6% vs 62.7%) as well as a longer median time from initial diagnosis in patients (91.1 vs 
73.5 months) with 6.4 mg/kg. 
Patients were included based on local laboratory HER2 testing and confirmed by central laboratory 
testing. Based on local testing for the 5.4 mg/kg group, 78.4% of patients were IHC 3+ and 21.6% 
were ISH+. Based on central testing, 51.0% of patients were IHC 3+ and 11.8% were ISH+. Four 
patients had missing data for central testing. 
Outcomes and estimations 
Tumor response and duration of response 
Efficacy results on tumor response are summarized below. Confirmed ORR by ICR was 51.0% (95% 
CI: 36.6, 65.2) for the 5.4 mg/kg; CR was observed in 3.9% of patients and PR in 47.1% of patients. 
Median duration of confirmed response by ICR was 12.7 months (95% CI: 6.7, -). A total of 53.8% of 
patients were censored. Median time to confirmed response by ICR was 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.5, 
2.9). 
Results for the 6.4 mg/kg were largely comparable to that of the 5.4 mg/kg group, except for a higher 
rate of CR by ICR (11.9% vs 3.9%). 
Confirmed DCR was 88.2% and 95.5% in the 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg dose group, respectively.

The phase 1 dose-finding J101 study first tested the dose range of 0.8 mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg Q3W. 
Based on the balance between activity and safety, as demonstrated in the observed data and the ER 
analyses, doses of 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg were selected for further investigation in the dose 
expansion part (Part 2) of the study. 
In this application, the efficacy in the patients included with HER2-positive MBC are of focus. For these 
patients, similar and clinically relevant efficacy was shown for both doses tested in Part 2. With a 
median follow-up of 11.6 months, confirmed ORR by ICR of 52.5% (95%CI: 43.1, 61.8) was observed 
among all 118 patients with HER2-positive BC (range 51-52.5%). The duration of response by ICR was 
13.3 months (range: 12.7-13.6), which was similar across the dose groups and clinically relevant. It is 
agreed that there is no relevant dose-effect relationship between the two tested doses in HER2-
positive MBC patients in Part 2 of the study, and both ORR and DOR by IRC were clinically meaningful. 
Efficacy update 
An efficacy update was performed based on a data cut-off (DCO) of 01 Aug 2019 for the 5.4 mg/kg 
dose group. As of the Update DCO, the median duration of study follow-up for subjects with metastatic 
HER2-positive breast cancer assigned to 5.4 mg/kg trastuzumab deruxtecan was 10.8 months (range: 
0.8-36.4), median treatment duration was 8.54 months (range: 0.7, 37.1). Seven out of fifty (14.0%) 
patients were ongoing on study treatment at the time of the efficacy update DCO.  
The confirmed ORR based on ICR was unchanged, at 51.0% (26/51 subjects) (95% CI: 36.6, 65.2). 
The median DoR in subjects with confirmed response based on ICR was 10.8 months (95% CI: 6.7, 
non-estimable). A total of 50.0% of patients were censored. There were 47% PFS events, and 
estimated median PFS by IRC remained unchanged (13.7 months; 95% CI: 8.5, 19.6). A total of 
52.9% of patients were censored.

•  Normal hepatic function to mild hepatic dysfunction: total bilirubin (TBL) ≤1.5 ×upper limit of 
normal (ULN) or <3 × ULN in the presence of documented Gilbert's syndrome or liver 
metastases at baseline, and aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤5 × 
ULN. 
•  Moderate hepatic dysfunction: TBL >1.5 × ULN and ≤3 × ULN, and AST/ALT ≤5 × ULN. After 
approximately 10 subjects with moderate hepatic dysfunction had been enrolled, subsequent 
subjects with moderate hepatic dysfunction were to be excluded. 
11. Adequate blood clotting function, defined as: 
• 
International normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time ≤1.5 × ULN. 
12. If less than 100 of the planned 150 subjects enrolled and dosed at the RP2D (20 from the Part 1 
PK stage, 30 from the Part 1 Dose Finding stage, and 100 from Part 2a) had a history of pertuzumab 
treatment in the metastatic setting, enrollment could continue to achieve this number, and prior first- 
or second-line pertuzumab treatment in the advanced/metastatic BC setting was required for these 
additional subjects. 
13. Subjects were to be able and willing to comply with protocol visits and procedures. 
•  Male and female subjects of reproductive/childbearing potential had to agree to use a highly 
effective form of contraception or avoid intercourse during and upon completion of the study 
and for at least 4.5 months after the last dose of study drug. For the purpose of this protocol, 
methods considered to be highly effective methods of contraception included: 
−  Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) 
−  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, 
injectable, implantable) 
Intrauterine device 
Intrauterine hormone-releasing system 
− 
− 
−  Bilateral tubal occlusion 
−  Vasectomized partner 
−  Complete sexual abstinence defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during and 
upon completion of the study and for at least 4.5 months after the last dose of study drug. 
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) was not an 
acceptable method of contraception. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 114/210 
 
 
 
−  Nonchildbearing potential was defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal 
ligation or hysterectomy; postmenopausal was defined as 12 months of spontaneous 
amenorrhea (in questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle-stimulating 
hormone >40 mIU/mL and estradiol <40 pg/mL [147 pmol/L] was confirmatory). Females 
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) whose menopausal status was in doubt were 
required to use 1 of the contraception methods outlined for women of childbearing 
potential if they wished to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they had to 
discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. 
For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks elapsed between the cessation of therapy and 
the blood draw; this interval depended on the type and dosage of HRT. Following 
confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they could resume the use of HRT during the 
study without using a contraceptive method. 
14. Men who were fertile and sexually active had to be willing to use highly effective methods of 
contraception if their partners were of reproductive potential. 
15. Male subjects could not freeze or donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the study 
period, and at least 4.5 months after the final study drug administration. Preservation of sperm was to 
be considered prior to enrollment in the study. 
16. Female subjects could not donate, or retrieve for their own use, ova from the time of screening 
and throughout the study treatment period, and for at least 4.5 months after the final study drug 
administration. 
17. Provided informed consent for study participation before performance of any studyspecific 
procedures or tests.

After approximately 30 subjects with inactive brain metastases had been enrolled at the RP2D (20% of 
the 150 planned to receive the RP2D), subsequent subjects with any current or past history of brain 
metastases were to be excluded.

inhibitor. 
13. Unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy, defined as toxicities (other than alopecia) 
not yet resolved to Grade ≤1 or baseline. Subjects with chronic Grade 2 toxicities could have been 
eligible at the discretion of the investigator after consultation with the Sponsor Global Clinical Lead or

ingredients in the drug product. 
Patients included had to have centrally confirmed HER2-positive expression according to the guidelines 
from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which is standard for clinical trials and endorsed. It is 
acceptable that patients included in part 2b could have discontinued treatment with TDM1 for reasons 
other than resistance or refractory disease, since this is a moderately toxic treatment and 
discontinuations due to AEs is reflective of clinical practice.  
Patients were excluded, if they had a history of non-infectious ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids; 
had current ILD/pneumonitis; or had suspected ILD/pneumonitis that could not be ruled out by 
imaging at screening. This is endorsed, since fatal cases of ILD/pneumonitis has been observed with 
trastuzumab deruxtecan. Moreover, this important information for prescribers have been included in 
the SmPC section 4.4, which is also endorsed.

Treatments 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) was administered as an IV infusion once every 3 weeks, on Day 
1 of each 21-day cycle. 
• 
• 
In the Part 1 PK stage, subjects were randomized to receive 1 of 3 doses: 5.4 mg/kg, 6.4 
mg/kg, or 7.4 mg/kg. 
In  the  Part  1  Dose  Finding  stage,  subjects  were  randomized  to  receive  1  of  the  2  doses 
selected in the PK stage (identified as 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg). 
Once  assigned,  subjects  were  to  remain  on  study  in  their  treatment  group  and  not  to  change  dose 
groups. 
• 
In Part 2, all subjects received 5.4 mg/kg, which was determined to be the RP2D. 
The first dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan was to be administered over 90 minutes (±10 minutes). If 
there was no infusion-related reaction (IRR) after the first dose, subsequent doses were to be 
administered over 30 minutes (±5 minutes).

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was ORR assessed by an ICR based on tumor scans. 
Objective response rate was defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a best overall 
response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), with confirmation of response, 
based on RECIST 1.1. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 117/210 
 
 
 
 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• Investigator-assessed ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a BOR of CR or PR 
based on local radiologists/investigators' tumor assessments using RECIST 1.1. 
• DCR, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a BOR of CR, PR or SD. 
• CBR, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a BOR of CR or PR or more than 6 months 
of SD. 
• DoR, defined as the time interval between the date of first documentation of objective response (CR 
or PR) and the date of the first objective documentation of disease progression or death due to any 
cause. 
• PFS, defined as the time interval between the date of randomization/registration and the first 
documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause. Disease progression was determined 
through an ICR of tumor scans using RECIST 1.1. Clinical progression without objective documentation 
of disease progression per RECIST 1.1 was not considered to be progression while deriving the PFS 
endpoint. 
• OS, defined as the time interval between the date of randomization/registration and the date of 
death due to any cause. If the analysis subject was not known to have died prior to the data cut-off 
(DCO) date, OS was censored at the last contact date at which the subject was known to be alive. 
• Best percent change in sum of diameters of measurable tumors, based on RECIST 1.1. The best 
percent change was defined as the percent change in the smallest sum of diameters from all post-
baseline tumor assessments, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. 
The assessment of DCR, CBR, DoR, PFS, and best percent change in measurable tumor sum of 
diameters was based on ICR. 
Exploratory Objectives 
• To evaluate the duration of stable disease (SD) and time to response (TTR). 
• To evaluate potential biomarkers of response, such as serum HER2 extracellulardomain (HER2 ECD). 
• To evaluate exposure-response (ER) relationships for efficacy and safety endpoints. 
Safety endpoints 
Safety is monitored based on reporting of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests (hematology 
and blood chemistry tests), vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations. AEs are recorded and 
categorized using the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) version 20.1. AEs and 
abnormal laboratory test results, if applicable, were to be graded using National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. AEs of special interest (AESIs) 
were ILD, LVEF decrease, QT prolongation and infusion related reactions (IRRs). An independent ILD 
adjudication committee (AC) was established for the trastuzumab deruxtecan program that was 
responsible for reviewing all cases of potential ILD on an ongoing basis. 
Sample size 
The sample size of approximately 230 subjects was chosen to further confirm the safety profile and 
secure adequate accuracy to determine ORR of trastuzumab deruxtecan. A sample size of 50 subjects 
(30 subjects from dose finding and 20 subjects from PK stage) provides ORR with 90% CI within plus 
or minus about 10% under the expected ORR=35%. The probabilities of observing the lower bound of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 118/210 
 
 
 
the 90% CI > 15% and ORR ≥ 30% are 93.4% (72.0% for the lower bound of the 90% CI > 20%) 
and 81.2% under the expected ORR=35%, respectively. A sample size of 150 subjects (50 subjects 
from Part 1 who receive the optimal dose level and 100 subjects from Part 2a) provides ORR with 95% 
CI within plus or minus 10% of the ORR. The probabilities of observing the lower bound of the 95% CI 
> 20% and ORR ≥ 30% are 98.2% and 91.6% under the expected ORR=35%, respectively. 
Randomisation 
Part 1 of the study was randomized and consisted of 2 stages: a PK stage and a Dose Finding stage. 
Part 1 was designed to bridge Phase 1 experience to the to-be marketed product (new process, new 
formulation) and adequately support dose and regimen recommendations: 
In the PK stage of Part 1, approximately 60 subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 
doses of DS-8201a (5.4 mg/kg, 6.4 mg/kg, and 7.4 mg/kg; approximately 20 subjects per dose level). 
After review of the PK findings, 2 dose levels were to be selected for further evaluation. 
In the Dose Finding stage of Part 1, approximately 60 subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
1 of the 2 doses selected (approximately 30 subjects per dose level), and a dose-justification ER 
(exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety) analysis was to be conducted in order to determine the 
optimal dose of DS-8201a. 
Randomization in Part 1 was stratified by region (Asia, rest of the world). Part 2 was not randomized, 
and all subjects were to receive DS-8201a at the recommended dose determined in Part 1. 
The study was divided into two parts. Part 1 aimed to determine the optimal dose, and it was further 
divided into Part 1a (3 test doses) and Part 1b (2 of the best performing doses from Part 1a). Part 2 
included subjects, who received the optimal dose selected in Part 1b. Part 1 was randomized 1:1 
equally among the included doses and stratified by region (Asia, Rest of the World (RoW)). Part 2 was 
a single arm trial, and thus randomization was not applicable. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a single arm study and thus all patients received the active treatment. No blinding for the 
different dose levels was applied in Part 1. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 119/210 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy analyses were to be performed on the Enrolled Analysis Set (EAS, which was the same as the 
Intent-to-Treat [ITT] Analysis Set) and the Response Evaluable Set (RES). 
The primary analysis population is the EAS, which includes all subjects with signed ICF who were 
randomized or registered. The response evaluable set was used as supplementary analysis for the 
primary efficacy endpoint. This is agreed. 
Tumor assessment was performed at Screening and every 6 weeks thereafter using computerized 
tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (spiral CT scan or MRI with ≤5 mm cuts). 
Imaging data obtained every 6 weeks per protocol were provided by the investigators to the ICR. 
Confirmation was performed no earlier than 4 weeks (28 days) from the time a response of CR/PR is 
first suspected. 
Dose selection analysis 
The following criteria were to be included as part of the information used for dose selection. Additional 
factors such as depth of response (ie, best change from baseline in sum of diameters of measurable 
tumors), DoR, and chronic toxicity were also to be included. 
Assuming binomial distribution for the ORR, and a beta conjugate prior, the high dose level was to be 
considered efficacious relative to the low dose level if the posterior probability of the difference in ORR 
given the observed data showed that: 
Probability (ORRhigh - ORRlow >5% | data) >80%. 
Assuming normal-normal conjugate prior mode, the high dose level was to be considered toxic relative 
to the low dose level if the posterior probability of the differences in the percent change from baseline 
in neutrophil count (PCNC) given the observed data showed that: Probability (PCNChigh - PCNClow <-
10% | data) >80%. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: IRC-ORR 
The estimate of ORR and its 2-sided 95% exact (Clopper-Pearson) confidence interval (CI) were to be 
provided in each Part/dose group and overall. In addition, ORR based on BOR within a fixed duration 
(eg, 3, 6, 9, 12 months) along with their 2-sided 95% exact CIs were to be provided in each Part/dose 
group and overall. DCR, CBR, and investigator-assessed ORR without confirmation of CR/PR were to be 
performed using the same methods as for the ORR analysis. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Distribution of time to event endpoints such as duration of response, PFS, and OS will be estimated 
using Kaplan-Meier method and results presented graphically. Additionally, quartile event times and 
their 2-sided 95%CI using Brookmeyer and Crowley methods will be presented for each part/dose 
group and overall. In addition, Kaplan-Meier estimates of duration of response, PFS, and OS rates at 
fixed time points (e.g. 3, 6, 9, 12 months) along with their 2-sided 95%CIs will be provided for each 
part/dose group and overall provided enough events are recorded. The CIs for the rates at fixed time 
points will be calculated by applying asymptotic normality to the log-log transformation of the rates. 
Duration of response (DoR) 
The rules for censored cases are defined as follows: 
•  Subjects who are not known to have progressed or died at the data cut-off date will be 
censored at the date of last evaluable tumor assessment. An evaluable tumor assessment 
is defined as an assessment where the overall tumor response is not “Inevaluable (NE)”. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 120/210 
 
 
 
•  Subjects who start other anti-cancer therapy prior to disease progression or death will be 
censored at the date of the last tumor evaluable assessment prior to starting new 
anticancer therapy. 
•  Subjects who progress or die after missing ≥ 2 consecutive scheduled tumor assessments 
will be censored at the date of the last evaluable tumor evaluation prior to progression or 
death. In this study, tumor assessment is performed at every 6 weeks (±7 days), 
therefore, progression or death after missing ≥ 2 consecutive scheduled tumor 
assessments are defined as progression or death that occurs after more than 14 weeks 
(two tumor assessment visits plus 2 weeks visit window).  
Progression free survival (PFS) 
The rules for censored cases are defined as follows: 
•  Subjects known to not have progressed or died at the data cut-off date will be censored at the 
date of last evaluable tumor assessment. 
•  Subjects who discontinue from the study prior to first post-baseline evaluable tumor 
assessment for a reason other than death will be censored at the date of randomization (the 
date of registration for not randomized subjects). 
•  Subjects who start other anti-cancer therapy prior to disease progression or death will be 
censored at the date of last tumor evaluable assessment prior to starting new anti-cancer 
therapy. 
•  Subjects who have progressive disease or die after missing ≥ 2 consecutive scheduled tumor 
assessments (i.e., more than 14 weeks, allowing for 2 weeks visit window) will be censored at 
the date of last evaluable tumor assessment prior to progression. 
•  Subjects without baseline evaluable tumor assessment will be censored at the date of 
randomization or registration, except death within first 2 scheduled tumor assessments (i.e., 
14 weeks) will be considered as a PFS event. 
Overall survival (OS) 
After discontinuation from study treatment, follow-up information for survival and subsequent 
anticancer therapy will be obtained every 3 months (±14 days) from the date of the Follow-up visit 
until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow up, or study closure, whichever occurs first. 
The rules for censored cases are defined as follows: 
• 
If analysis patient is not known to have died prior to the data cut-off date, OS will be censored 
at the last contact date at which the subject is known to be alive. The last contact date is 
defined as the last date the subject was known to be alive up-to the data cut-off date. 
The primary endpoint is ORR (CR + PR). The proportion of responders were presented together with 
the 95%CI (Clopper-Pearson). Patients with no postbaseline data or non-evaluable were included as 
non-responders. Secondary endpoints included in the statistical section are DoR, PFS and OS, which 
were described using the Kaplan-Meier method. The following patients were censored in the DoR 
analysis: patients who did not experience an event while being observed, patients who switched to 
another anti-cancer therapy before PD or death, patients who only had clinical progression, and 
patients who died or experienced PD after two or more missed assessments. For PFS, the DoR 
censoring rules were used. In addition, subjects without a baseline assessment or who discontinue 
from the study prior to first post-baseline evaluable tumor assessment for a reason other than death 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 121/210 
 
 
 
were also censored. For OS, patients not known to have died will be censored at the date of last 
contact. The main analysis was repeated using the INV-assessments and the RES set. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
A total of 253 subjects were enrolled and treated at 1 of 72 study sites in the following countries: US 
(24 study sites), Japan (10), France (9), Spain (8), South Korea (7), Belgium (5), UK (5), and Italy 
(4); an additional 5 study sites screened, but did not enroll, subjects. The first subject was dosed at 03

Table 24 Key demographic characteristics (Enrolled analysis set, U201) 
Baseline disease characteristics are summarised in Table 25. For patients receiving 5.4 mg/kg 
(N=184), all but 1 of the patients enrolled in the study had confirmation that their tumors were HER2-
positive based on central laboratory testing of submitted archival tissue. Most patients had metastatic 
disease (93.5%), with 30.4% having liver metastases and 13.0% having brain metastases. Half of the 
patients were hormone-receptor positive (52.7%) and 50.5% estrogen-receptor positive. Patients had 
either ECOG performance status 0 (55.4%) or 1 (44.0%), and normal renal function (48.9%) or mild 
renal impairment (37.5%). Further, patients had either normal hepatic function (57.1%) or mild 
hepatic impairment (41.3%).

Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analysis (censoring) 
The Applicant provided the reasons for censoring patients due to “other reasons” and performed a 
supplementary analysis, where patients censored due to discontinuation before PD, PD after missing 
two or more assessments, and initiation of new anti-cancer therapy before PD are imputed as events. 
Censoring reasons for DoR per the Update DCO (01 Aug 2019) due to “other reasons” were all due to 
discontinuation before PD/death.

The sensitivity analyses presented in table 1 above show that the median DOR is changed from 14.8 
months per the original (prespecified) analysis to 9.8 months or from 20.8 months per the original 
(prespecified) analysis to 10.0 months. It is noted that more patients were censored for DOR at EMA 
DCO (n=46) vs update DCO (n=30) and this may have impacted the analyses.

Subgroup analyses of DoR for confirmed responses by ICR as of the Update DCO for subgroups based 
on HR status (positive/negative) and prior pertuzumab use (yes/no) in Study U201 showed the 
following:  
• 
• 
The median DoR was 13.8 months (95%CI: 9.7, 15.0) for patients, who were HR-positive 
(54/184 patients) and 14.8 months (95%CI: 14.8, NE) for those who were HR-negative 
(55/184 patients).  
The median DoR was 15.0 months (95%CI: 14.8, NE) for patients, who had received prior 
pertuzumab (76/184 patients) and 13.8 months (95%CI: 9.0, 13.8) for those who had not

Phase 2, 2-part open-label, multicentre study to justify the recommended dose 
of trastuzumab deruxtecan and investigate further the safety and efficacy in 
subjects with unresectable and/or metastatic human epidermal growth factor 
receptor (HER)2-positive breast cancer (BC) previously treated with 
trastuzumab emtansine (TDM1). Eligible subjects were administered 
trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W). 
Part 1 was randomized (stratified by region: Asia, rest of the world) and 
designed to bridge Phase 1 experience to the to-be marketed product (new 
process, new formulation) and adequately support dose and regimen 
recommendations. 
• 
In the PK stage of Part 1, subjects were randomized (1:1:1) to either 5.4, 
6.4, or 7.4 mg/kg trastuzumab deruxtecan. After review of the PK, 2 dose 
levels were to be selected for further evaluation. 
In the Dose Finding stage of Part 1, subjects were randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to 1 of the 2 doses selected, and a dose-justification exposure 
response (ER) (exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety) analysis was to be 
conducted to determine the optimal dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
Part 2 was not randomized, all subjects received trastuzumab deruxtecan at 
the recommended dose determined in Part 1. Part 2 was subdivided into 2 
cohorts: 
• 
• 
Part 2a included approximately 100 subjects. 
Part 2b, was an exploratory cohort to explore the efficacy of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan in subjects who discontinued T-DM1 for reasons other than 
disease progression (PD). Enrollment in Part 2b would be completed when 
approximately 100 subjects had been enrolled in Part 2a. The expected 
enrolment in Part 2b was approximately 10 to 15 subjects.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A pooled efficacy analysis was performed based on DS8201-A-J101 and DS8201-A-U201 at time of 
DCO for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and assigned to the 5.4 mg/kg dose of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan. The pooled analysis set included a total of 235 randomized patients (n=51 from J101 and 
n=184 from U201) of which 234 were treated. The median duration of follow-up was 7.40 months 
(range: 0.7, 30.4) and 120 (51.3%) patients were ongoing on study treatment. For the pooled analysis 
set, ORR was 58.3% (95%CI: 51.7%, 64.7%), median DoR was 16.9 months (95%CI: 9.5, NE), and 
median PFS was 13.9 months (95%CI: 10.9, NE).

The  Applicant  submitted  results  from  two  additional  studies  (historical  controls)  to  contextualize  the 
results of the pivotal study, the Unicancer study and a literature-based study (DS8201-PMx004). 
Real World Evidence – the Unicancer Study 
To supplement the clinical data package with real-world evidence and to estimate the expected clinical 
benefit (PFS, ORR) of other therapies with a comparable patient population, individual patient data 
were collected and analysed by Unicancer, a French network of 18 FCCCs. Beginning in 2008, 
Unicancer ESME research program has centralized existing real-world patient data in oncology to 
provide independent aggregated data for analysis. From the Unicancer ESME database of 
approximately 60,000 patients, a total of 19,867 patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer at 
any of the 18 FCCCs. From this database, 2 datasets were generated by Unicancer: The Reference 
Cohort and the Matched Cohort.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 149/210 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Reference Cohort dataset (N=721) consisted of data from patients with metastatic HER2-positive 
breast cancer who had initiated treatment in the metastatic setting between 01 Jan 2008 and 31 Dec 
2016 and received at least 1 therapy post treatment with TDM1 as of 17 Sep 2018. Of these 721 
patients, 398 patients had at least 2 evaluable radiological exams and imaging data from 222 patients 
could be made available for ICR assessment. These 222 patients in the Reference Cohort went through 
a matching process to identify patients with comparable baseline characteristics to those of the 180 
subjects treated at the 5.4 mg/kg dose in Study U201 Part 1 and Part 2a (at a DCO of 10 Dec 2018). 
Using the propensity score caliper matching method, 1 patient from the Reference Cohort was matched 
to 1 subject from Study U201 without replacement, provided that the absolute difference in the logit of 
propensity score of the matched pair was less than a prespecified threshold (the caliper). Prespecified 
demographics and baseline characteristics considered for matching were: 1) Prior treatment with 
pertuzumab (yes/no); 2) HR status at T DM1 therapy (positive/negative/not determined); 3) Presence 
of visceral disease at index date (present/absent); 4) Number of lines of treatment prior to T DM1 
(<2/≥2). The matching algorithm continued until either each Study U201 subject was matched with a 
patient from the Reference Cohort or no matching pairs could be found using the caliper. A 1:1 match 
within the prespecified threshold of the caliper was not possible for all Study U201 subjects as the 
Reference Cohort did not include enough patients within the caliper: 137/222 patients from the 
Reference Cohort were matched with 137 subjects from Study U201; 85/222 patients were excluded 
after the matching process.   
Figure 32 Generating the Matched Cohort in the Unicancer Study 
Source: adapted from Module 5.3.5.3 UARP MBC2018-10 v2.1 Table 1 
In the Matched Cohort, 136 patients were female and 1 was male, whereas all 137 Study U201 
subjects were female. A total of 40.9% of Matched Cohort patients and 48.2% of Study U201 subjects 
were <55 years of age. There were 59.9% of Matched Cohort patients and 56.9% of Study U201 
subjects who were HR-positive at the time that TDM1 treatment was initiated. A difference in ECOG PS 
between Matched Cohort patients and Study U201 subjects was observed: 35.8% of Matched Cohort 
patients had an ECOG PS of 0 and 64.2% had an ECOG PS ≥1, while 54.7% of Study U201 subjects 
had an ECOG PS of 0 and 45.3% had an ECOG ≥1. However, patients in the Matched Cohort were 
relatively healthy as evidenced by the 91.7% 6-month survival rate from the date of the first 
subsequent treatment following the TDM1 based regimen.

The primary objective of both the Reference Cohort and Matched Cohort was to describe patient 
characteristics and clinical features, and a secondary objective was to describe the treatment 
strategies for these patients. A comparison of the baseline characteristics indicates that patients in the 
Reference Cohort had a lower rate of exposure to pertuzumab prior to TDM1 therapy than patients in 
the Matched Cohort (38.7% vs. 56.9%, respectively). The difference between the Reference Cohort 
and Matched Cohort in pertuzumab exposure prior to TDM1 therapy is likely due to the difference in 
enrolment timeframes.   
The Reference Cohort included patients treated between 01 Jan 2008 and 31 Dec 2016. Pertuzumab 
became available for commercial use in France beginning Mar 2013. The first subject was enrolled in 
Study U201 in Sep 2017. The Matched Cohort, therefore, included a higher proportion of patients with 
prior pertuzumab to correspond to the more recent treatment patterns included in Study U201.  
Matched patients received a median of 7.0 lines of treatment for their metastatic breast cancer with a 
median of 3.0 lines of treatment, including TDM1, prior to the index date. Prior to the index date, 
94.9% of matched patients received trastuzumab. A total of 89.8% received a taxane, 48.9% received 
an anthracycline, 32.8% received an anti-estrogen, and 32.8% received an aromatase inhibitor. 
In the line of therapy immediately after TDM1, a total of 73.7% of patients in the Matched Cohort 
received an anti-HER2 therapy: 48.9% of patients received trastuzumab, 29.9% received lapatinib, 
2.2% received TDM1, and 2.2% received another anti-HER2 treatment. A total of 35.0% of patients 
received oral chemotherapy, 37.2% received IV chemotherapy, and 12.4% received endocrine 
therapy. Disease progression was the most common reason for termination. 
Table 42: Baseline characteristics of patients before and after matching 
Objective response rates in first-line treatment post-TDM1 for patients in the Matched Cohort were 
evaluated by an ICR. Of the 137 patients in the Matched Cohort, 22 patients were excluded during 
central review because the image quality of the submitted scans was such that the radiologist reviewer 
was not able to assess the response. These subjects are listed as “unknown”. The remaining 115 
matched subjects were used for analysis of response. The ORR for the Matched Cohort was equal to

Literature Based Analysis (DS8201-PMx004): Comparator Analysis in Metastatic Breast 
Cancer using Model-Based Meta-Analysis 
To understand the historical context of expected response rates of trastuzumab deruxtecan in the 
post-trastuzumab setting, a literature-based analysis was conducted. The objectives of this analysis 
were twofold:  
• Review literature for prospective or retrospective trials in second line or later advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer who previously received prior trastuzumab and chemotherapy. 
• Perform a model-based meta-analysis to quantify ORR, median PFS time, and median OS time in this 
population for comparison with ongoing trials of trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
An initial review was performed for trials conducted in populations after prior trastuzumab and a 
taxane. The search criteria were subsequently broadened to include trials in second line or later 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer in subjects who received prior trastuzumab and any 
chemotherapy. Specifically, the following study inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied: 
Inclusion criteria: 
•  Reports (full papers and abstracts) of prospective and retrospective studies on treatment of 
subjects with advanced or metastatic breast cancer who were HER2-positive and had previously 
received trastuzumab and taxanes or other chemotherapies. 
−  The study included an anti-HER2 therapy, which is required by NCCN and ESMO 
guidelines. The study had to include at least 1 of the clinical outcomes, response to 
treatment (i.e., ORR) or survival (i.e., median PFS, median OS) (English language) 
Exclusion criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Indication: The purpose of the study was not second-line or later treatment for advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer. 
Publication: The study did not add new data (e.g., reviews, meta-analysis, preclinical research, 
letter, case report, etc.) or the report duplicated prior published results. 
Treatment: The regimens in the study did not include an anti-HER2 therapy; or the study or arm 
reported unapproved therapies, surgery, radiotherapy, dietary supplements, or observation; or the 
study or arm reported TDM1 treatment results. 
Population: Prior therapy was not trastuzumab plus taxanes or other chemotherapies. 
Endpoints: no outcome of interest. 
In total, 258 references were selected for review and 64 references from 58 studies were selected for 
data extraction. Another 21 studies were excluded, as either reporting results for TDM1 or for 
investigational agents that have not received marketing authorization. In total, 8827 subjects from 48 
treatment arms and 37 studies were included in the analysis of ORR, median PFS, and median OS.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy assessment of the new active substance trastuzumab deruxtecan is primarily based on the 
pivotal Study 201, which is a phase 2, two-part, open-label, single-arm, cohort study. Patients were 
recruited from 72 study sites and a third of the patients were enrolled in the geographic regions of 
either Asia, US or Europe, respectively. A total of 184 HER2-positive breast cancer patients were 
treated with the proposed dose of 5.4 mg/kg. Supportive clinical trial evidence was submitted from 51 
patients treated in the phase 1 study J101. 
Primarily, patients being progressive during or after T-DM1 treatment (resistant/refractory) were 
included which allows assessment of efficacy of treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan. All patients 
had at least 2 prior anti-HER2 based regimens, about half in the neo(adjuvant setting) and almost all 
patients in the metastatic setting. The criterion for prior pertuzumab in the advanced/metastatic 
setting (at least 100/150) ensures that the patient population reflects current EU treatment practice 
(ESMO guideline).  
Patients had to have measurable disease at baseline as the primary endpoint was ORR. It is noted that 
patients with stable brain metastases were to be included, and recruitment was restricted to 30 
patients with inactive brain metastases due to a similar approach in other studies of anti-HER2 therapy 
(the NALA and TH3RESA study), and since 24 patients with brain metastases were enrolled in the 
study, none were excluded based on the limitation on brain metastases enrolment. This is acceptable 
as an adequate update of the SmPC has been done. There seems to be no clinically relevant difference 
in ORR in patients with stable brain metastases (n=24) compared with the subgroup without brain 
metastases; however, no firm conclusions can be drawn due to small numbers. 
The RP2D of 5.4 mg/kg is adequately justified based on the phase 1 study J101 and the dose-finding 
part 1 of study U201. Higher doses did not lead to a significant increase in efficacy whereas tolerability 
was considerably worse. There is limited support for the efficacy of reduced doses in case of toxicity. 
The overall number of patients treated with 3.2 mg/kg was 12/253 in study U201. Further information 
is expected post-authorisation from the ongoing phase 3 studies.   
The single-arm, open-label design of the pivotal study U201 is acceptable in the context of a CMA, 
since the targeted indication is for the last-line setting and there is no SOC. Confirmatory randomised 
data is requested from one of the two ongoing phase 3 randomised trials as a specific obligation (SOB) 
to the CMA, ie, Study U301, since the study population from this study is more similar to the currently 
evaluated study population from the pivotal Study U201. 
The statistical methods (calculation of proportions and Kaplan-Meier method) are overall agreed. The 
Applicant has conducted sensitivity analyses following a conservative approach and provided the 
reasons for censoring patients due to “other reasons” and performed a supplementary analysis, where 
patients censored due to discontinuation before PD, PD after missing two or more assessments, and 
initiation of new anti-cancer therapy before PD are imputed as events. The Applicant has clarified that 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 156/210 
 
 
 
 
 
the censoring reasons for DoR per the Update DCO (01 Aug 2019) due to other reasons were all due to 
discontinuation before PD/death. 
In Study U201, baseline characteristics showed that the median age was 55 years, with 76% of the 
patients being less than 65 years of age, and 24% of the patients were ≥65 years, which is reflective 
of the patient population. No male patients were included, which is acceptable since breast cancer is 
rare in men. However, the results from the pivotal trial is considered extrapolatable to men with HER2-
positive metastatic breast cancer, in line with previous EMA decisions for HER2-targeted treatments 
(e.g. trastuzumab). Most patients were white (54.9%) or Asian (38%), of ECOG PS 0 (55.4%) or 1 
(44%), and the mean weight and BMI were within the normal range although the range was wide. The 
level of HR/PR positive or negative disease and HER2 expression by central lab were acceptable and 
reflects the target population. The vast majority of patients had visceral metastases located at the 
lungs (57%), liver (30%), and/or brain (13%), while 28% had bone metastases, which is also 
reflective of the targeted disease. 90% of the patients had more than 3 prior systemic therapy 
regimens, not counting endocrine (HR) therapy, so the study population was heavily pre-treated. A 
total of 65.8% had prior pertuzumab, but only 27.7% as first or second line in the metastatic setting, 
which is consistent with the inclusion criteria and the proposed indication and appears to reflect clinical 
practice at the time of the study. It is noted that ~36% of the patients had PD as best response to 
TDM1, and considering the high response rate in the pivotal study U201, this does not seem to affect 
later response to trastuzumab deruxtecan. Subgroup analyses on ORR for patients with/without prior 
pertuzumab in the 1st or 2nd line setting in advanced/metastatic breast cancer showed at least 
comparable ORR for patients with prior treatment, providing reassurance on the efficacy of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan in this patient population. 
The primary objective is to assess the ORR by independent blinded review and the secondary 
objectives are to assess the duration of the responses (DOR), DCR, CBR, PFS and OS. The independent 
assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint is endorsed for this single-arm, open-label, non-
comparative pivotal study, which could otherwise be subject to investigator bias. The clinical benefit 
rate (CBR) is clinically relevant to measure for the targeted disease, as patients with SD for 6 months 
or longer is deemed to have clinical benefit from the given treatment.  
Study U201 was conducted in accordance with the ICH for GCP and the Declaration of Helsinki. Though 
a high number of major protocol deviations were reported, these do not raise particular concerns. This 
is supported by data from national GCP inspections and monitoring reports. 
The Applicant provided supportive data in the form of RWE from the Unicancer study and a literature-
based analysis. The Unicancer study matched cohorts from a) real-world evidence describing the use of 
regimens including anti-HER2 agents, chemotherapies, and endocrine therapy post-TDM1 from a 
patient population and b) matched these to the patients enrolled in Study U201, using 1) Prior 
treatment with pertuzumab (yes/no); 2) HR status at T DM1 therapy (positive/negative/not 
determined); 3) Presence of visceral disease at index date (present/absent); 4) Number of lines of 
treatment prior to T DM1 (<2/≥2), but not age, no CVD, no other diseases, and the time frame is also 
different. Hence, the matching is not optimally done.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
This assessment focuses on the 184 HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with the proposed 
dose of 5.4 mg/kg, included in Part 1 and Parts 2a and 2b of the pivotal study U201, as they reflect the 
targeted patient population. The median age was 55 years (range 28-96), 76% of the patients were 
less than 65 years of age, and 24% of the patients were ≥65 years. No male patients were included. 
Most patients were white (54.9%) or Asian (38%). The majority of patients were of ECOG PS 0 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 157/210 
 
 
 
(55.4%) or 1 (44%), and the mean weight and BMI were within the normal range. Approximately half 
of the patients had tumors, which were either Estrogen receptor positive or negative, while a third of 
the tumors were Progesterone receptor positive. 83.7% of the tumors had HER2-ekspression on ICH of 
3+ by central lab. The vast majority of patients had visceral metastases, which were located at the 
lungs (57%), liver (30%), and/or brain (13%). It is also noted that 28% of the patients had bone 
metastases, which is unmeasurable per RECIST 1.1. 90% of the patients had more than 3 prior 
systemic therapy regimens not counting endocrine (HR) therapy. ~66% of the patients had prior 
pertuzumab, ~54% other anti-HER2 treatment, while all of the patients had prior TDM1 and 
trastuzumab. Efficacy after TDM1 was presented under Ancillary analyses. The sample size is 
considered sufficient for the evaluation of clinically meaningful benefit for a CMA. 
The primary endpoint of ORR by ICR was 60.3% at the initial data cut and this result was maintained 
at the updated DCO with 12.2 months of follow-up time i.e. 60.9% (95%CI: 53.4; 68). Update DCO 
show that 6% of the patients had a CR and 54.9% had a PR, while 36.4% had SD as best overall 
response. Further updated ORR was 61.4% (95%CI: 54.0; 68.5). This response rate is considered 
promising and much higher than expected beforehand (~35%) based on literature data. Sensitivity 
analyses support the reported ORR. The magnitude of response is considered highly clinically relevant 
for this heavily pre-treated study population, who have no standard of care. It is noted that very few 
had a non-evaluable best overall response, which is reassuring. The waterfall plot clearly reflects these 
data, which are considered highly clinically relevant for this heavily pre-treated study population, who 
have no standard of care. Hence, the ORR data show clinically significant activity of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan even though no comparative data is available. The sensitivity analyses of ORR are overall 
consistent with the results of the primary endpoint. 
The secondary endpoint of duration of response by IRC at update DCO show a median of 14.8 
months (95%CI: 13.8, 16.9), which is a clinically relevant result with a median follow-up time of 12.2 
months. Further updated data showed a median duration of response of 20.8 months (95%CI: 15.0, 
NE) with a median follow-up time of 20.5 months and 34.8% events of PD or death. Approximately 
65% of the patients were censored for DOR and 24.1% of the patients are ongoing without an event, 
so this is considered a highly clinically relevant DOR for this heavily treated study population.   
The updated PFS at EMA DCO was 19.4 months (95%CI: 14.1, NE), and this data is partly immature 
as well as difficult to assess without a comparator arm. The low event rate of 38% is showing a low 
incidence of either progression or death in the follow-up period and the estimate is in line with the 
DOR.  
Spaghetti plots of the repeated tumour measurements (sum of diameters at each tumour assessment) 
for each patient, who was censored from the PFS and DoR analyses for reasons apart from data cut off 
were presented for PFS and for DoR at the time of the updated DCO 08Jun20. These plots indicate that 
the initial decreases in tumour size after starting treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan were 
maintained for subjects who were censored for any reason other than DCO. 
OS data were initially immature with only 10% deaths, but the Applicant has also provided updated OS 
data based on a DCO of 08 Jun 2020 with a median duration of follow-up of 20.5 months showing a 
median OS of 24.6 months (95% CI: 23.1, NE). At that time, 37 subjects (20.1%) were still on 
treatment and a total of 65 deaths had occurred among the 184 subjects treated at 5.4 mg/kg. This is 
clinically meaningful and compares favorably to other reported OS outcomes from similar studies in 
patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, who had been previously treated with 2 lines of prior anti-
HER2-based regimens (targeted treatment setting), where median OS in the range of 17.2-21.9 
months has been reported in literature. Moreover, the Applicant was recommended to provide the final 
OS data after the Study U201 closes.

The ORR of and apparent durable responses observed are considered to be clinically meaningful in the 
target population; however, data were immature with a high rate of censored patients. Updated data 
based on an update at DCO 8 June 2020 showed that the median DoR increased from 14.8 months to 
20.8 months and these results provide further support for the conclusion that the high response rate of 
about 60% is accompanied by a highly durable response. However, the censoring rate remained above 
60%, with a high percentage of patients now censored for other reasons (n=46/112 for DoR). For 
some of these patients, no reason for discontinuation of treatment was provided (n=31/112 for DoR). 
This might be due to adverse events, but it could also be that patients were censored after an 
investigator-determined progression without central confirmation, which along with receiving new 
anticancer therapy, could be considered to be an example of informative censoring. A conservative 
sensitivity analysis was performed, with the censored times in the updated DoR analysis imputed as 
event times for all patients censored for other reasons than ongoing without PD. This approach 
substantially lowered the median DoR to 10.0 months (95%CI: 7.9, 12.7). Moreover, additional 
sensitivity analyses of DoR with clinical progression and investigator determined PD counted as events 
rather than censored, and the median DoR for the EMA DCO is estimated to be 14.6 months (95%CI 
10.3, 18.2). Given that it is reasonable to presume that these patients may have showed signs of 
progression, an event based on investigator or ICR progression could be a better measure of efficacy, 
so this may be a more realistic estimate than the 20 months that was first estimated in the EMA DCO. 
However, a median DoR of 14 months in combination with an ORR of around 60% is just as well 
considered a major therapeutic advantage (MTA) over existing therapies in the target population. 
Subgroup analyses for the 184 HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with the proposed dose 
overall show consistent results for ORR by ICR across important subgroups, with a point estimate of 
more than 50% for all except for the subgroups of very small sample size, e.g. the 9 patients who 
have moderate renal impairment. It is noted that even for the ER/HR negative; for patients with prior 
pertuzumab treatment in the metastatic setting, and for patients with PD as best response to TDM1, 
the point estimate for ORR was more than 60%. The subgroup analyses for ORR by ICR were also 
consistent regardless of age, race, region, country, ECOG PS 0 vs 1, disease burden (sum of diameter 
target lesions), following immediately TDM1 treatment, and HER2 status (ICH3+ vs ISH+). It is highly 
encouraging that efficacy seems established across important subgroups regardless of presence of 
negative prognostic factors such as old age, ECOG PS 1, visceral disease, HR negative status. It is also 
reassuring that trastuzumab deruxtecan showed similar and clinically relevant response in patients 
(n=56), who had treatment with TDM1 just before entering the study. Subgroup analyses of DOR were 
also consistent in patients regardless of HR status (positive vs negative) and prior pertuzumab use 
(yes vs no), which is supportive of the primary endpoint. 
Evaluating the updated efficacy results summarized above, it is agreed that trastuzumab deruxtecan 
was associated with longer median DoR and median PFS than the data currently reported for available 
therapies in the proposed setting. Hence, these updated efficacy data establish that the ORR, PFS, and 
OS observed with trastuzumab deruxtecan 5.4 mg/kg show a major therapeutic benefit over existing 
treatments in the proposed patient population, which has no clearly preferential treatment options and 
where there remains an unmet medical need. 
Of main relevance for the targeted patient population with HER2+ MBC is the clinical benefit rate 
(CBR), and the confirmed CBR (i.e. CR+PR+ SD >6 months) was 70.7% (95%CI: 63.5; 77.1) for the 
relevant study population at the proposed dose (N=184). This is considered clinically relevant that 
two-thirds of the patients derive clinical benefit from the study treatment, as both response to 
treatment (ORR) and stabilisation of the disease for more than 6 months is considered beneficial for 
these heavily treated patients. The DCR is not considered of great relevance in this patient population, 
where the ORR and DOR results are considered to better reflect benefit in this single arm pivotal trial.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 159/210 
 
 
 
The median time to response was 1.6 months, which is in line with other chemotherapies and clinically 
relevant for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. 
To contextualize the results in the absence of a comparator arm, the Applicant submitted data from a 
matched cohort using the Unicancer database and results from a literature-based analysis to provide 
an understanding of the range of ORR and PFS reported in published clinical studies. However, since 
patients in the control and experimental could differ in important prognostic factors despite matching, 
this is considered data of an exploratory nature. Moreover, even though the assessment of ORR was 
done by IRC, of the 137 patients in the Matched Cohort, 22 patients had to be excluded because of 
poor image quality precluding an assessment of response, so only 115 matched subjects were used for 
analysis of response. 
In nearly all cases, the lower limit of the 95%CI for ORR and median PFS with trastuzumab deruxtecan 
exceeds the upper limit of the 95%CI reported in a variety of literature studies, including those studied 
in patients with two prior anti-HER2 regimens. For the Unicancer study, selection was based on a post-
baseline variable (tumour scan) which may introduce selection bias. The impact is unknown as no 
further information was available. About 74% of patients received anti-HER2 therapy as their first 
treatment post-T-DM1. The ORR in the matched cohort (N=115) was 12.2% (95%CI: 6.2, 18.2), 
which is considerably lower (five times) than that reported for the overall population in U201. Further, 
median PFS was 4.7 months (95% CI: 3.8, 6.0) which is about three times lower than observed after 
trastuzumab deruxtecan. These data might support compelling efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
However, comparisons to historical controls carry inherent biases with regards to different factors and 
the following points are especially raising uncertainties on/questioning the current historical 
comparison: 1. The timing and measurement of ORR and PFS may differ between the matched cohort 
and study U201; 2. Data on ORR and PFS for those patients in study U201 who were matched with the 
external cohort have not been provided; 3. Uncertainties remain on the comparability of patient 
populations for other factors than those included for matching. It was clarified that in the matched 
cohort, ORR was based on unconfirmed CR and PR. The ORR for 137 patients in study U201 used for 
the 115 Unicancer matched cohort was 59.1% based on ICR, slightly lower than for the overall study.  
Information on timing and follow-up scans with information on tumour status at each assessment was 
not available. Further, a full comparison of baseline characteristics between patients in U201 and the 
Unicancer matched cohort could not be provided. Information on definition of and censoring of PFS, 
suggest a broader definition. A further major limitation is the lack of DoR data. So, given the identified 
limitations and remaining uncertainties related to the use of the Unicancer cohort, the results from this 
cohort cannot be considered supportive . 
A literature study was performed and searched for patients on second line or later therapy for 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who previously had received prior trastuzumab and a 
chemotherapy, and the search yielded 37 studies and 8827 patients with ORR, PFS, or OS data. The 
results showed that the overall mean ORR was estimated to be 25.5% (95% prediction range: 17.1-
36.1), while the median PFS was estimated to be 5.8 months (95% prediction range: 3.2-10.5). In the 
subgroup of studies that had a median of at least 2 prior chemotherapies or at least 2 prior anti-HER2-
based regimens, the median ORR was estimated to be 15% (95%CI: 9, 30) and the median PFS was 
estimated to be 4.8 months (95%CI: 3.3, 5.5). 
Overall, the analyses of RWE and historical data from the literature seem to reflect lower efficacy than 
observed in the pivotal study U201; however, the data is considered of an exploratory nature, since 
there are too many uncertainties such as non-optimal matching and missing assessment of response in 
16% of the matched subjects, which cannot be properly estimated or adjusted for.Despite the 
uncertainties described above, the comparison with literature data from currently anti-HER2 regimens 
used in the same setting/target population support a major therapeutic advantage based on efficacy 
for trastuzumab deruxtecan; the median DoR of 20.8 months is about 3 times higher than the reported 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 160/210 
 
 
 
median DoR (6.0 -8.5 months) or median PFS (4.9 – 7.8 months) and the differences is as such that it 
is considered to overcome the uncertainties related to the lack of an active comparator arm and thus 
indirect comparisons, in the context of the requested CMA.  
The data translate in clinical benefit with trastuzumab deruxtecan where currently there is an unmet 
medical need. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The Applicant’s proposal to provide comprehensive data relevant to the target population comes from 
two global phase 3 randomised controlled studies of trastuzumab deruxtecan in advanced HER2-
positive breast cancer which are currently ongoing, DS8201-A-U301 (Study U301) and DS8201-A-
U302 (Study U302). The proposal to provide comprehensive data in reasonable timelines is overall 
considered acceptable and the Study U301 is considered the most informative for efficacy in terms of 
time-dependent endpoints PFS and OS, which is the main uncertainty in this dossier hence submission 
of interim data from that study is proposed as a SOB to the CMA. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The updated results from the pivotal Study U201 show clinically relevant efficacy of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan regarding a high response rate, and durations of response, which appear durable in a 
heavily pre-treated population with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. The 
updated efficacy data have justified the clinical relevance of the results and the major therapeutic 
advantage of trastuzumab deruxtecan compared to existing therapies. The Applicant is recommended 
to provide final efficacy and safety data from the study U201. 
The CHMP considers the following measure (SOB) necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA:  
Submission of interim efficacy and safety data from the ongoing randomised phase 3 study DS-8201-
A-U301, a Phase 3 multicentre, randomised open-label, active-controlled study of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan versus treatment of investigator’s choice for HER2-positive, unresectable and/or metastatic 
breast cancer subjects pre-treated with prior standard of care HER2 therapies, including T-DM1. Due 
date: March 2022.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The primary data on clinical safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan are based on a DCO of 01 Aug 2019 for 
pooled data from the 2 clinical studies J101 and U201 (i.e., the Safety Update DCO). The primary 
safety database includes 542 subjects, who have received at least 1 dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan in 
Study J101 or Study U201, of whom 234 subjects with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic BC 
were treated with 5.4 mg/kg. For comparison purposes, data from the primary analyses for each of the 
2 studies were combined using the individual CSR DCOs (01 Feb 2019 for Study J101 and 21 Mar 2019 
for Study U201); hereafter this pool is referred to as “CSR DCO.” Update safety DCO was 01 Aug 2019. 
To allow for evaluation of the safety of the proposed dose, data from Study J101 and Study U201 were 
combined to create the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool (N=234). The following 3 additional pooled 
groups of data from Study J101 and Study U201 were designed to allow evaluation of possible dose 
response effects and safety in other tumor types:   
•  HER2-positive BC treated with ≥6.4 mg/kg (6.4, 7.4 or 8.0 mg/kg) (N=137) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 161/210 
 
 
 
•  All tumor types treated with 5.4 mg/kg (N=275) 
•  All tumor types treated with ≥6.4 mg/kg (6.4, 7.4, or 8.0 mg/kg) (N=258) 
The overall safety population consisted of 542 patients, who have received at least 1 dose of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan in Study J101 or Study U201, and of these 234 patients with HER2-positive 
unresectable or metastatic BC were treated with 5.4 mg/kg the study treatment at the proposed dose 
(5.4 mg/kg). The size of the safety data available on patients, who have received the study treatment 
at the proposed dose is considered acceptable for a CMA. 
Patient exposure 
Table 45: Summary of Exposure (Safety Analysis Set) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 162/210 
 
 
 
 
The median duration of exposure to trastuzumab deruxtecan for the all tumor types safety pool (herein 
after ATT pool) (n=275) was 9.43 months (range: 0.7-37.9) and 9.82 months (range: 0.7-37.1) for 
the HER2+MBC pool (n=234) (Update safety DCO 01 Aug 2019). 66% of the patients in the ATT pool 
had exposure of more than 6 months and 28% were exposed for more than 12 months. 
The dose intensity was high and similar in both pools, with 5.25 mg (range: 2.5-5.7) for the ATT pool. 
This corresponds to more than 70% of the patients having had 90% or more of the planned dose of 
5.4 mg/kg, which is acceptable and considered a relevant exposure for a tumour response.

Almost all of the patients experienced at least one AE in the pivotal study U201 (HER2+ BC) at safety 
update DCO, and 57.1% experienced a ≥grade 3 AE. SAEs were observed in 22.8% of the patients, of 
which 4.9% had an SAE leading to death. The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs was 15.2%. 
Common AEs in the BC pool were nausea (77.7%), fatigue (49.5%), vomiting (45.7%), and 
constipation (35.9%). As expected with an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), such as trastuzumab 
deruxtecan, the haematological toxicity was also common with anaemia (29.9%) and neutrophil count 
decrease (34.8%). However, febrile neutropenia was only reported in 1.7% of patients and grade 3 
anaemia (8.7%), white blood cell count decrease (6.5%), and neutrophil count decrease (7.6%) were 
within an acceptable level. Other common grade 3 AEs were nausea (7.6%) and fatigue (6.0%), also 
of an acceptable level.

At the time of the start of the clinical program, ILD was considered to be an important potential risk for 
trastuzumab deruxtecan. After the first suspected fatal ILD case occurred, the Sponsor established an 
external ILD Adjudication Committee for the program that adjudicated all events of potential ILD 
reported by investigators on an ongoing basis. Events of potential ILD from all clinical studies of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan were closely monitored. In Jan 2018, in response to the observed ILD events, 
ILD was determined to be an important identified risk. In the spring of 2019, a global ILD awareness 
campaign was initiated to educate both investigators and patients, with the goal of reducing the risk of 
severe ILD (including fatal cases) by proactively detecting and intensively managing ILD at an early 
stage. While there was an increase in the frequency of subjects with adjudicated drug-related ILD at 
the time of the Safety Update DCO (13.7% vs. the 9.4% as of the CSR DCOs), most events reported 
were Grade 1 or Grade 2, with no new events of Grade 4 or Grade 5 reported after the DCOs for the 
individual studies (01 Feb 2019 for Study J101 and 21 Mar 2019 for Study U201). An analysis of all 
events of potential ILD that were adjudicated by the AC from Study J101 and Study U201 pooled data

is presented below, based on the 44 PTs listed in the ILD AC Charter. In addition, a comprehensive 
exploratory analysis to evaluate the potential risk factors for ILD was performed based on the 5-study 
pool.

positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool, Subject No. 10101020 in the All Tumor Types 5.4 mg/kg Pool (HER2-low GC), and Subject No. 10104009 in the All Tumor Types 
≥6.4 mg/kg Pool (HER2-positive GC 6.4 mg/kg) 
c  One subject in Study U201 had a TEAE of respiratory failure and subsequently died; the death was adjudicated as being due to ILD (after the database lock, the 
severity was updated from Grade 4 to Grade 5, following ILD AC re-adjudication of the event).  As of the CSR DCO, the database reflected this as a Grade 4 event; 
the database as of 01 Aug 2019 reflects it as a Grade 5 event. 
d  One subject in Study U201 had an event adjudicated as not related to trastuzumab deruxtecan, with death not due to ILD.  The ILD AC commented that “This is 
ARDS [acute respiratory distress syndrome] related to pneumococcal sepsis.”

Adverse events of special interest included ILD/pneumonitis, left ventricular dysfunction, QT 
prolongation, and infusion-related reactions. Below, the AESI of ILD/pneumonitis is assessed. 
35/234 (15%) patients in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool had an ILD event and of these, 32 
patients (13.7%) had treatment-related events of grade 1 in 6/234 (2.6%) patients, grade 2 in 
19/234 (8.1%), grade 3 in 1/234 (0.4%), grade 4 in 0, and fatal outcome (grade 5) was observed in 6 
patients (2.6%). 3 patients had ILD that was not deemed treatment-related and one was a fatal event 
of ARDS related to pneumococcal sepsis.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 174/210 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Compared to the HER2-positive BC ≥6.4 mg/kg Pool, the incidence of treatment-related ILD was lower 
in the HER2-positive 5.4 mg/kg Pool: 32/234 (13.7%) vs. 34/137 (24.8%). The median time to onset 
of ILD was 134.0 days (range: 35-338) and the median duration of the first event of ILD was 31.5 
days (range: 3-261). Trastuzumab deruxtecan was discontinued due to treatment-related ILD in 
22/234 (9.4%) patients, while the dose was reduced in 4/234 (1.7%) patients and dosing was 
interrupted in 6/234 (2.6%) patients. The outcome of the worst event of treatment-related ILD 
(further updated) was as follows: Not recovered/Not resolved: 7/32 (21.9%); Recovered/Resolved: 
15/32 (46.9%); fatal: 6/32 (18.8%); Recovered/Resolving: 2/32 (6.3%) and Recovered/Resolved with 
sequelae: 1/32 (3.1%). Reported outcome were missing for 1 patient.  
Relatively more patients from Japan experienced treatment-related ILD (12/51 [23.5%] vs. 20/183 
[10.9%] non-Japan) and some of the difference was driven by low grade events (grade 1 [7.8%]) 
Japan vs. 2 [1.1%] non-Japan or grade 2 ([15.7%] Japan vs. [6.0%] non-Japan).   
The Applicant has analysed at potential risk factors for ILD across all tumor types and doses in the 
combined five studies as of the CSR DCOs among the 645 treated patients. Of all the variables tested, 
only country (Japan vs. non-Japan) and number of prior regimens (<10 vs. ≥10) were statistically 
significant, i.e. patients from Japan had a higher incidence of treatment-related ILD (any grade) than 
patients from outside Japan did and patients with ≥10 prior regimens experienced a higher incidence 
than those who received <10 prior regimens, adjusting for all other factors.  
The chosen factors which were analysed are deemed clinically relevant, but the presented analysis 
does not find any clinically relevant risk factors that can be used for the prescriber, since the applied 
indication is not for patients treated with more than 10 prior regimens and the increased number of 
events in Japanese were mostly of low grade; hence, no regulatory consequences are warranted for 
this finding. The Applicant informs that they plan to continue investigating trastuzumab deruxtecan 
related ILD/pneumonitis in ongoing and future clinical studies and they will submit the results of these 
analyses post-authorization in the Periodic benefit risk evaluation reports. The plans for further 
investigation of ILD/pneumonitis risk factors and prognostic factors are endorsed.   
LVEF decrease 
The Sponsor reviewed the selected PTs in the AESI of LVEF decrease (listed in Table 2.21) to 
determine whether the event was related to LVEF per echocardiogram (ECHO)/multigated acquisition 
(MUGA) scan and determined that LVEF decrease is not a risk for trastuzumab deruxtecan. Only the PT 
of ejection fraction decreased was determined to indicate actual LVEF decrease.   
One additional subject reported a PT of ejection fraction decreased as of the Safety Update DCO 
(3/234 [1.3%] compared with 2/234 [0.9%] reported as of the CSR DCOs). Of these 3 subjects, 1 had 
a grade 2 event that was associated with drug interruption and resolved; 1 had a grade 3 event 
(reported the same day as Grade 1 mitral valve incompetence) that was associated with drug 
interruption and resolved; and the additional subject as of the Safety Update DCO had 3 grade 2 
events, none of which required any action with regard to study treatment and all of which resolved.   
No new events of cardiac failure were reported as of the Safety Update DCO. As reported as of the CSR 
DCOs, 2 subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool from Study U201 had events of PTs other 
than ejection fraction decreased: a grade 2 SAE of cardiac failure congestive that led to the withdrawal 
of the study drug and resolved (LVEF value of 63% at baseline and 66%-70% during the study); and a 
grade 1 cardiac failure on Day 1 that was not resolved at the DCO (LVEF value of 52% at baseline and 
57%-60% during the study). 
One new subject with a PT of asymptomatic troponin I increased (grade 3) was reported in the HER2-
positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool as of the Safety Update DCO. The event resolved, with no action taken 
regarding study drug. At the time of the Safety Update DCO, a PT of troponin increased was reported 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 175/210 
 
 
 
as a TEAE in 3/234 (1.3%) subjects (1 grade 1 event and 2 grade 3 events), and troponin I increased 
was reported as a TEAE in 4/234 (1.7%) subjects (2 grade 1 events and 2 grade 3 events) in the HER2 
positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool, with all events being asymptomatic. 
The AESI of LVEF decrease included many PTs (Table 2.21) and the Applicant found that ‘Left 
ventricular dysfunction’ could be related to treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan and this is an 
‘Important potential risk’ in the list of safety concerns. 
LVEF decrease is a known risk for Trastuzumab, but the Applicant states that after reviewing the 
selected PTs in the AESI of LVEF decrease it was determined that LVEF decrease is not a risk for 
trastuzumab deruxtecan. The definition of LVEF decrease should include patients with a reported AE of 
cardiac failure or LVEF decrease and/or a laboratory value of LVEF decrease.  
The Applicant provided an update on TEAEs of LVEF decease (grouped PTs) and LVEF laboratory 
abnormalities through EMA DCO. The number TEAE reported within the grouped preferred terms (PTs) 
for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was limited, with 4 patients (2.2%) reporting ejection 
fraction decreased through EMA DCO. All were considered treatment related by the investigator and 
resolved without study drug discontinuation. 
QT prolongation 
The Sponsor reviewed the 12 selected PTs in the AESI of QT prolongation (listed in Table 2.21). Of 
these 12 selected PTs, events of electrocardiogram (ECG) QT prolonged (14/234 [6.0%] subjects, 
compared to 12/234 [5.6%] as of the CSR DCOs) and seizure (1/234 [0.4%] subject), were reported 
in the HER2 -positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool. The SAE of seizure was in a subject who had a history of 
brain metastases and brain irradiation; the event was not associated with QT prolongation. No 
symptomatic QT prolongation, Torsade de pointes, or severe arrhythmic events were reported. 
Compared to results as of the CSR DCOs, 1 new asymptomatic event of ECG QT prolonged (Grade 3) 
was reported during this period in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool. The event resolved with no 
action taken regarding study drug. Based on ECG data, 8/234 (3.4%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 
5.4 mg/kg Pool had a maximum change from baseline in QT interval corrected for heart rate by 
Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) >60 msec, which was unchanged from the results seen at the individual 
DCOs. 
Infusion-related reactions 
The Sponsor reviewed the 14 selected PTs in the AESI of potential IRR (listed in Table 2.21). No new 
events of IRR were reported as of the Safety Update DCO. A total of 18/234 (7.7%) subjects in the 
HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool had events of potential IRR. After review, events of potential IRR in 
12 of the 18 cases were considered not to be IRR, due to alternative etiologies. Hence, six (2.6%) of 
the 234 subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool had events of IRR after review: 
• An SAE of Grade 1 hypersensitivity was reported in 1/234 (0.4%) subject. 
• The other 5/234 (2.1%) subjects had PTs of Grade 1 flushing (n=1) or Grade 2 infusion related 
reaction (n=4)  
• No subject had study drug discontinued or dose reduction due to a TEAE of IRR.  
• Dosing was interrupted in 1/234 (0.4%) subject who had a PT of infusion related reaction. 
• At the time of the DCO, the IRR had resolved in 5 subjects and resolved with sequelae in 1 subject, 
who had a second event approximately 6 months later that resolved on the day of onset (Day 178).   
• Prophylactic medication was allowed at the investigator’s discretion but was not mandated by 
protocol.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 176/210 
 
 
 
The available data did not allow for differentiation between prophylactic use and management of IRR; 
however, as stated above, no subject had study drug discontinued or dose reduction due to a TEAE of 
IRR.

The 2 pooled analysis groups were based on tumor type and assigned dose for subjects in Study J101 and Study U201. The individual studies include all treated 
subjects with HER2-positive BC who were assigned to receive 5.4 mg/kg in Study J101 or Study U201.  
a  In addition to the subjects listed in footnote “d,” 2 subjects in Study U201 had adverse event as primary cause of death, but the event occurred after the on-study 
treatment period.  
b  Other primary causes of deaths were recorded for 2 subjects in Study U201 (acute organ failure in Subject No.  and alteration of the general condition in relation to 
his cancer in Subject No.) (Safety Update Listing 1.5.2). 
c  On-study death was defined as any death that occurred from the date of the first dose up to 28 days (for Study J101) or up to 47 days (for Study U201) after the last 
dose of study drug. 
d  Includes DS8201-A-J101 Subject Nos. (respiratory failure),  (respiratory failure); DS8201-A-U201 Subject Nos. (shock haemorrhagic),  (general physical health

A total of 12 (4.7%) patients had at least 1 TEAE associated with a fatal outcome and narratives for all 
subjects who died on-study are provided. For 4 of the 12 patients (1 in the 7.4 mg/kg dose cohort  and 
3 in the 5.4 mg/kg dose cohort), the TEAEs with a fatal outcome were adjudicated as study drug-
related Grade 5 ILD by the ILD AC. An additional subject in the 5.4 mg/kg cohort had an event of ILD 
adjudicated as study drug-related Grade 4 ILD ; the patient subsequently died before DCO and the 
death was adjudicated as being due to ILD (for a total of 5 deaths due to study drug-related ILD 
events). In addition, one Subjectin the 5.4 mg/kg cohort had an event adjudicated as ILD but not 
related to study drug. Death was attributed instead to acute respiratory distress syndrome related to 
pneumococcal sepsis by the ILD AC.  
•  Subject No. (7.4 mg/kg), a 67-year-old white female subject, started treatment with DS-
8201a on 03 Apr 2018 and received the last dose on Day 246. A TEAE of grade 1 pneumonitis 
started on Day 253, which was considered to be study drug related by the investigator. Dosing 
was not modified, and the subject continued on treatment. On Day 266, the subject 
experienced Grade 3 hypoxia and the event led to treatment discontinuation. Death from study 
drug-related Grade 5 pneumonitis occurred on Day 285 from first dose. The event was 
adjudicated as Grade 5 study drug-related ILD by the ILD AC. 
•  Subject No. (5.4 mg/kg), a 45-year-old white female, started treatment with DS-8201a on 25 
Jul 2018 and received the last dose on Day 65. A Grade 5 event of acute respiratory failure 
occurred on Day 83 with death on Day 91. The event was adjudicated as Grade 5 study drug-
related ILD by the ILD AC. 
•  Subject No. (5.4 mg/kg), a 62-year-old white female, started treatment with DS-8201a on 21 
Aug 2018 and received the last dose on Day 43. The event of Grade 5 lymphangitis started on 
Day 63 and led to death on Day 72. The event was initially reported as pneumonitis before the 
study site updated the event to lymphangitis. The event was adjudicated as Grade 5 study 
drug-related ILD by the ILD AC. 
•  Subject No. (5.4 mg/kg), a 64-year-old white female, started treatment with DS-8201a on 13 
Sep 2018 and received the last dose on Day 127. Grade 1 cough and Grade 1 dyspnoea started 
on Day 120, which were considered to be drug-related by the investigator; dosing was not 
modified, and no treatment was administered. These TEAEs remained ongoing and on Day 
148, a diagnosis of pneumonitis was made and DS-8201a was withdrawn due to the event. 
Death from study drug-related Grade 5 pneumonitis occurred on Day 190 from first dose. The 
event was adjudicated as Grade 5 study drug-related ILD by the ILD AC. 
•  Subject No. (5.4 mg/kg), a 33-year-old white female, started treatment with DS-8201a on 29 
Aug 2018 and received the last dose on Day 85. A Grade 1 TEAE of pneumonitis 
(asymptomatic per verbatim term) was reported on Day 86, which the investigator considered 
to be study drug-related and for which dosing was interrupted and treatment with oral 
methylprednisolone (48 mg) was started on Day 106. The event worsened to Grade 2 on Day 
134 and was associated with Grade 1 hypoventilation. Treatment of pneumonitis with 
methylprednisolone continued and DS-8201a was withdrawn due to the event on Day 134. 
Both events of pneumonitis and hypoventilation remained ongoing. A TEAE of respiratory 
failure was reported as starting on Day 137, with death from study drug-related Grade 5 
respiratory failure occurring on Day 145. The event was adjudicated as Grade 4 study drug-
related ILD by the ILD AC. 
•  Subject No. (5.4 mg/kg), a 48-year-old white female, started treatment with DS-8201a on 26 
Jul 2018 and received the last dose on Day 156. The event of Grade 5 pneumonia started on 
Day 167 with death from the event on Day 180. The event was adjudicated as Grade 5 ILD not

related to DS-8201a by the ILD AC. The event was attributed instead to acute respiratory 
distress syndrome related to pneumococcal sepsis by the ILD AC. 
In 6 of the 12 patients with TEAEs associated with a fatal outcome, death was not considered to be 
study drug-related by the investigators: 2 subjects with disease progression, these 2 subjects are 
not described below. Based on the protocol, when a subject died from PD with no other immediate 
causes, disease progression was to be reported as an SAE; and 1 subject each with shock 
haemorrhagic , asthenia, acute hepatic failure and acute kidney injury, and general physical health 
deterioration. 
•  Subject No. (5.4 mg/kg), a 69-year-old white female, started treatment with DS-8201a on 08 
May 2018 and received the last dose on Day 45. A Grade 5 shock haemorrhagic occurred on 
Day 87 and the subject died the same day. No laboratory test results were available for the 
time of the event. 
•  Subject No. (6.4 mg/kg), a 78-year-old white female, started treatment with DS-8201a on 03 
May 2018 and received the last dose on Day 99. The TEAE of Grade 5 asthenia started on Day 
113. The subject had ongoing Grade 2 anemia. After the start of the event of asthenia, the 
subject experienced Grade 2 pleural effusion and Grade 1 ascites and was hospitalized on 30 
Aug 2018. Treatment with DS-8201a was discontinued on Day 119 due to physical 
deterioration. Death due to asthenia occurred on Day 153 and was considered to be unrelated 
to study drug. 
•  Subject No.  (5.4 mg/kg), a 53-year-old white female, started treatment with DS-8201a on 
23 Aug 2018 and received the last dose on Day 85. Study drug was interrupted on Day 104 
due to a TEAE of blood bilirubin increased. Events of Grade 1 abdominal distension, peripheral 
swelling, chromaturia, and dyspnea, and Grade 2 fatigue started on Day 117. Ultrasound 
results at the time showed hepatic metastatic disease and cholelithiasis without evidence of 
cholecystitis. The subject received 5 cycles of study drug and discontinued due to progressive 
disease. The TEAEs of Grade 5 acute hepatic failure and acute kidney injury started on Day 119 
and were attributed to disease progression (liver metastases) with death from the events on 
Day 125. 
•  Subject No. (5.4 mg/kg), a 66-year-old white female, started treatment with DS-8201a on 20 
Jun 2018 and received the last dose on Day 190. The subject was diagnosed with pneumonia 
based on radiological findings and was hospitalized; during this time, general condition 
worsened, with an ECOG PS of 3 reported. The event of Grade 5 general physical health 
deterioration started on Day 196, for which DS-8201a was interrupted. Death due to the event 
occurred on Day 219 from first dose. 
•  Subject: 61-year-old female initially diagnosed with breast cancer on 22 OCT 2014. She 
enrolled in the DS8201-A-U201 clinical study and was assigned to the dose level of 5.4 mg/kg 
in Part 2 Cohort 2a. At study entry, the subject had stage IV breast cancer with disease 
progression. Her last anti-cancer regimen prior to participating in this study included 
trastuzumab and capecitabine (15 JAN 2018 to 09 JUL 2018). The tumor was HER2 IHC 2+, 
ISH positive. The subject had ECOG PS of 1 and had received 5 prior anti-cancer regimens, 
including anti-HER2 agents. Relevant prior radiation therapy included femoral neck stereotactic 
radiotherapy (JUL 2017). Relevant medical history included asthenia (ongoing from 2018) and 
ascites (ongoing from 2018). On 12 NOV 2018 (Day 98), the subject was diagnosed with Grade 
3 hyperkalaemia, considered a serious adverse event as it required hospitalization. The last 
dose of DS-8201a (5.4 mg/kg) the subject received prior to onset of the event of 
hyperkalaemia was on 09 OCT 2018 (Day 64). The subject’s potassium was reported as 8.8 
mmol/L (reference range: 3.4 to 4.5 mmol/L); 9 L of fluid was removed by paracentesis on the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021

same day. There were no ECG signs of hyperkalemia. The subject improved with intravenous 
medications of insulin/glucose QD and polystyrene sulfonate QD and oral furosemide QD (12 
NOV 2018 to 13 NOV 2018) for Hyperkalemia. On 13 NOV 2018 (Day 99), laboratory result 
showed normal potassium. On 15 NOV 2018 (Day 101), the event of hyperkalaemia resolved 
with potassium of 4.16 mmol/L. The action taken with DS-8201a as a result of the event 
hyperkalaemia was not applicable as DS-8201a had been previously interrupted. Relevant 
concomitant medications the subject was taking at the time of the event of hyperkalaemia 
included morphine, enoxaparin sodium, and prednisolone. DS-8201a was permanently 
discontinued due to the Investigator’s decision on 22 NOV 2018 (Day 108). The subject 
received a total of 4 doses of DS-8201a. On 03 DEC 2018 (Day 119), the subject died due to 
deterioration of her general condition caused by her cancer. It is unknown whether an autopsy 
was performed. The Investigator considered the event of hyperkalaemia unrelated to DS-
8201a. This is agreed.

alkaline phosphatase increased being the two most common grade≥3 events in 5.1% and 2.2% of the 
patients, respectively. Hence, shifts in blood chemistry were acceptable and manageable.

BC = breast cancer; DCO = data cut-off; HER2 = human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; N = total number of subjects in the pool; n = number of subjects with both 
baseline and post-baseline values; ULN = upper limit of normal 
Percentages were calculated using the non-missing n as the denominator. 
Safety Update DCO = 01 Aug 2019 
Each subject was counted for only the worst case observed post-baseline.   
The 4 pooled analysis groups were based on tumor type and first dose received for subjects in Study J101 and Study U201. 
a  Non-missing n is the number of subjects with both baseline and post-baseline data. 
b  “Concurrent” is defined as these abnormalities occurred within a 28-day window.  
Source:  Safety Update Table 1.3.1.2 
In the ATT pool, the patients commonly had increased ALT (17.6%), AST (43.6%), or ALP (36%) 
compared to baseline. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
Subjects were categorized into age groups of <65 or ≥65 years and <75 and ≥75 years of age at 
baseline. Since only 11 subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 Pool were ≥75 years of age, no 
meaningful comparison between subjects <75 and ≥75 years of age could be made.  
The following differences of at least 10 pp or a doubling in incidence were noted when comparing 
subjects <65 years of age (N=173) and subjects ≥65 years of age (N=61):  
•  A higher proportion of subjects ≥65 years than subjects <65 years had ≥Grade 3 TEAEs: 38/61 
(62.3%) vs. 90/173 (52.0%). 
•  A higher proportion of subjects ≥65 years than subjects <65 years had ≥Grade 3 events of fatigue 
(8/61 [13.1%] vs. 5/173 [2.9%]), and febrile neutropenia (4/61 [6.6%] vs. 0%). 
Compared to data as of the CSR DCOs, overall TEAEs and PTs of anaemia and neutrophil count 
decreased were no longer notably different (ie, no longer had a >10-pp difference or a doubling 
between the 2 age subgroups).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021

Race 
The following differences were noted when comparing Asian subjects (N=97) and White subjects 
(N=119) in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool. Since over 90% of subjects in each pool were either 
Asian or White, differences in other races were not evaluated. 
•  SAEs occurred more frequently in White vs Asian subjects:  34/119 (28.6%) vs. 18/97 (18.6%). 
• 
• 
TEAEs associated with outcome of death occurred more frequently in White subjects (10/119 
[8.4%] vs. 2/97 [2.1%] Asian subjects); this difference was driven primarily by the deaths due to 
adjudicated drug-related ILD in 5/119 (4.2%) White subjects compared to 1/97 (1.0%) Asian 
subject. 
TEAEs associated with drug interruption occurred more frequently in Asian subjects than White 
subjects: 43/119 (44.3%) vs. 37/97 (31.1%). 
•  A higher proportion of Asian vs White subjects had an event of neutrophil count decrease:  
42/97 (43.3%) vs. 28/119 (23.5%) subjects, with values ≥Grade 3 in 27/97 (27.8%) vs. 
15/119 (12.6%), and WBC count decrease (grouped term): 30/97 (30.9%) vs. 15/119 (12.6%) 
subjects, with values ≥Grade 3 in 7/97 (7.2%) vs. 6/119 (5.0%). 
•  A lower proportion of Asian vs White subjects experienced ≥Grade 3 AEs in the Gastrointestinal 
disorders SOC (8/97 [8.2%] vs. 23/119 [19.3%]), and the following TEAEs: 
o  Nausea: ≥Grade 3 in 2/97 (2.1%) Asian vs. 13/119 (10.9%) White subjects 
o  Abdominal pain (grouped term): 11/97 (11.3%) vs. 31/119 (26.1%) subjects, with values 
≥Grade 3 in 2 (2.1%) vs. 1 (0.8%) 
o  Vomiting: 37/97 (38.1%) vs. 67/119 (56.3%) subjects 
o  Diarrhea: 17/97 (17.5%) vs. 50/119 (42.0%) subjects 
o  Dyspnea: 6/97 (6.2%) vs. 25/119 (21.0%) subjects, with values ≥Grade 3 in 1/97 (1.0%) 
vs. 3/119 (2.5%) 
o  Fatigue:  37/97 (38.1%) vs. 68/119 (57.1%) subjects 
The differences between Asian and White subjects reported as of the CSR DCOs remained in the Safety 
Update DCO, with only anemia no longer showing a 10-pp difference between races. 
Country 
The following differences were noted between subjects in Japan (N=51) and subjects in other countries 
(N=183) in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool. 
•  A higher proportion of subjects in Japan were ≥65 years (18/51 [35.3%] Japan vs. 43/183 
[23.5%] non-Japan). 
•  Subjects in Japan had longer median treatment duration (10.58 months; range:  0.7-37.1) than 
non-Japan subjects (9.69 months; range:  0.7-26.3), and lower median relative dose intensity 
(94.3% vs. 97.6%). A higher proportion of subjects in Japan had a treatment duration >12 months 
(19/51 [37.3%] vs. 50 [27.3%] non-Japan). 
•  A higher proportion of subjects in Japan experienced adjudicated drug-related ILD (12/51 [23.5%] 
vs. 20/183 [10.9%]). This difference was driven primarily by events of Grade 1 (4/51 [7.8%]) 
Japan vs. 2/183 [1.1%] non-Japan) or Grade 2 (8/51 [15.7%] vs. 11/183 [6.0%]).  (No event was 
adjudicated as drug-related ≥Grade 3 ILD in Japan in this pool.) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 187/210 
 
 
 
•  A lower proportion of subjects in Japan experienced TEAEs associated with an outcome of death 
(1/51 [2.0%] Japan vs. 11/183 [6.0%] non-Japan).  A similar difference was also seen based on 
race (Asian vs. White). 
•  A higher proportion of subjects in Japan discontinued due to TEAEs (13/51 [25.5%] Japan vs. 
23/183 [12.6%] non-Japan).  
•  A higher proportion of subjects in Japan had drug interruption due to TEAEs (27/51 [52.9%] Japan 
vs. 60/183 [30.2%] non-Japan). 
The differences observed between the country subgroups were similar as of the CSR DCOs and the 
Safety Update DCO. 
Geographic Region 
The following differences were noted between subjects in Europe (N=68), North America (N=82), and 
Asia (N=84) in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool. 
•  Median treatment duration in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool was lower in the European 
subgroup (9.25 months vs. 9.74 months in North America and 10.78 months in Asia), primarily 
due to the timing of study initiation in the various geographical regions. 
•  Compared with the North America subgroup, the European subgroup had a higher proportion of 
subjects with asthenia (23/68 [33.8%] vs. 6/82 [7.3%]), dyspnea (18/68 [26.5%] vs. 12/82 
[14.6%]), and lymphocyte count decrease (grouped term) (11/68 [16.2%] vs. 5/82 [6.1%]); and 
a lower proportion of subjects with fatigue (28/68 [41.2%] vs. 59/82 [72.0%]), alopecia (27/68 
[39.7%] vs. 41/82 [50.0%]), diarrhea (22 [32.4%] vs. 36 [43.9%]), and cough (11/68 [16.2%] 
vs. 28/82 [34.1%]). 
• 
• 
• 
The European subgroup had a higher proportion of subjects with a TEAE associated with an 
outcome of death than either of the 2 other geographical regions (7/68 [10.3%] vs. 4/82 [4.9%] 
North America, 1/84 [1.2%] Asia). Each of the 7 subjects in the European subgroup had death 
associated with a different PT (acute respiratory failure, disease progression, general physical 
health deterioration, lymphangitis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure).  
The European subgroup had a higher proportion of subjects with a serious TEAE than either of the 
other 2 geographical regions (23/68 [33.8%] vs. 17/82 [20.7%] North America, 14/84 [16.7%] 
Asia). The most common serious TEAE in all 3 subgroups was ILD (4/68 [5.9%] Europe, 3/82 
[3.7%] North America, and 1/84 [1.2%] Asia), with no PT or grouped term accounting for a 
preponderance of serious TEAEs. 
The European subgroup had a higher proportion of subjects with TEAEs of ILD (11/68 [16.2%]) 
than the North America subgroup (7/82 [8.5%]).   
More patients of ≥65 years of age had a grade ≥3 treatment emergent AEs (38/61 (62.3%) vs. 
90/173 (52.0%), especially regarding fatigue (8/61 [13.1%] vs. 5/173 [2.9%]), and febrile 
neutropenia (4/61 [6.6%] vs. 0%). 
Renal function at baseline 
In the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool, 113 subjects entered the study with normal renal function, 
91 with mild impairment (39%; creatinine clearance ≥60 and <90 mL/min), 29 with moderate 
impairment (12%; creatinine clearance ≥30 and <60 mL/min), and 1 with severe impairment 
(creatinine clearance ≥15 and <30 mL/min). No subject entered the study with end-stage renal 
disease. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 188/210 
 
 
 
   
A higher proportion of subjects with moderate renal impairment at baseline had study drug 
discontinuation for TEAEs and drug-related TEAEs (24.1% overall, 20.7% drug related) than subjects 
with normal renal function at baseline (13.3% overall, 11.5% drug related) or mild renal impairment 
(14.3% overall, all drug related). 
Furthermore, a higher proportion of subjects with moderate renal impairment at baseline had events of 
adjudicated drug-related ILD (9/29; 31.0%) compared to subjects with normal renal function (12/113; 
10.6%) or mild renal impairment (10/91; 11.0%) at baseline.  
Hepatic function at baseline 
In the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool, 132 subjects entered the study with normal hepatic function 
(56%), 99 with mild impairment (42%), and 1 with moderate impairment. No subject entered the 
study with severe hepatic impairment. The safety profile was similar between subjects with normal 
hepatic function and those with mild hepatic impairment, except for ≥Grade 3 TEAEs, which were 
reported in 59.8% of subjects with normal hepatic function and 46.5% of subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment.

Table 69: Summary of Adverse Events by Pooled Group and Age (Safety Analysis Set) 
The provided tables above show that in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool, the distribution of 
patients in each age subgroup were as follows: <65 years, N=173; 65 to 74 years, N=50; 75 to 84 
years, N=8; and ≥85 years, N=3. This reflects the patient population but limits any firm conclusions 
for the age group patients who are more than 75 years of age due to small numbers. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 190/210 
 
 
 
 
 
It is noted that there are more serious AEs (26% vs 22%), AEs associated with discontinuations (20% 
vs 15%), cardiac disorders (12% vs 7.5%) and infections (60% vs 45.1%) in the 65-74 years of age 
group compared to patients <65 years.  
Immunological events 
Antidrug Antibody-related Adverse Events study U201 
Thirteen (5.1%) of 253 subjects had a positive ADA sample at baseline. Of these 13 subjects, 5 (2.0%) 
subjects had positive ADA samples while on treatment. Of these 5 subjects: 3 subjects were positive 
both at baseline and post-baseline; 1 subject who tested ADA-negative at baseline was ADA-positive 
post-baseline; and 1 subject with no detectable ADAs at baseline was positive post-baseline. One 
subject (No. 81090001), who was ADA-positive at baseline experienced a TEAE of Grade 2 IRR at Cycle 
1 Day 1. In the ADA evaluations, no subject shifted from ADA negative at baseline to ADA positive 
after baseline.  One subject who received trastuzumab deruxtecan and itraconazole shifted from ADA-
positive at baseline to ADA-negative after baseline. 
Information on ADAs are collected in the ongoing phase 3 studies with trastuzumab deruxtecan, see 
Table below. 
Table 70: Immunogenicity Sampling Strategy for Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Clinical 
Development Program 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The PK results of the DDI study DS8201 A A104 are summarized in previous section, please see clinical 
pharmacology for details. The conclusions of this study were as follows:   
• Concomitant use of trastuzumab deruxtecan with ritonavir (dual inhibitor of OATP1B/CYP3A) or 
itraconazole (strong inhibitor of CYP3A) resulted in increases of 22% and 18% in AUC17d of MAAA-
1181a, respectively. 
• Concomitant use of ritonavir and itraconazole did not affect the exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
• Trastuzumab deruxtecan in combination with ritonavir or itraconazole showed a similar safety profile 
as observed in other trastuzumab deruxtecan studies.

Post marketing experience 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan was approved in the USA on 20 Dec 2019 and was first made available in the 
USA on 31 Dec 2019. Trastuzumab deruxtecan was also approved in Japan on 25 Mar 2020, but no 
post-marketing experience in Japan is available. The post marketing data are summarized below. 
Since the approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan in the USA, the estimated cumulative post-marketing 
patient exposure through 13 Mar 2020 was 94 patient-years (1633 infusions x 21 / 365). A total of 111 
AEs was reported in 50 patients during the post-marketing period from 20 Dec 2019 through 13 Mar 
2020, including 16 serious events in 15 patients. The majority of events were non-serious (95 events 
in 38 patients). Gastrointestinal disorders were the MedDRA SOC with the highest proportion of AEs 
(37 of the 111 total events), with the majority (35/37) of these events being non-serious. 
Sixteen serious AEs were reported in 15 patients 4 of these were reported to have a fatal outcome 
(neoplasm malignant, respiratory failure, death and malaise). 1 was reported as not recovered 
(deafness), 1 was reported as recovered (pneumonitis), and 10 had an unknown outcome (ILD, 
aphasia, ascites, general physical health deterioration, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, hospitalisation, 
hyponatraemia, infusion related reaction, nausea, neutropenia). There was 1 report of an SAE of 
neutropenia (DSU-2020-108177), and the outcome is yet unknown but additional follow up information 
is expected. 
Death due to any cause was reported in 4 patients, with PTs of death (1), respiratory failure (1), 
neoplasm malignant (1) and malaise (1). All were medically confirmed reports and were deemed not-
related to treatment.   
Cumulatively, since the approval of Enhertu in December 2019, 3 patients treated in the post 
marketing setting were reported to have had a potential ILD AE: PTs were ILD (1 with unknown

outcome), pneumonitis (1 recovered), and respiratory failure (1 with a fatal outcome). All events were 
serious events. Two of the 3 AEs were medically confirmed reports and 1 was a consumer report.   
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety populations of interest are patients with all tumor types (ATT pool, n=275) and the breast 
cancer patients (n=234) treated with the proposed dose of 5.4 mg/kg. The median duration of 
exposure to trastuzumab deruxtecan for the ATT pool was almost 10 months for both safety pools at 
the Update safety DCO of 01 Aug 2019. 66% of the patients in the ATT pool were exposed for more 
than 6 months, while 28% were exposed for more than 12 months. Hence, the median exposure is 
similar in both safety pools and considered acceptable for the applied CMA. Moreover, safety data from 
a phase 3 confirmatory study is expected as part of the special obligations for a CMA.  
Almost all of the patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) in the pivotal study U201 at 
safety update DCO. In the HER2-positive breast cancer pool, gastrointestinal events were the most 
frequent AEs for trastuzumab deruxtecan, e.g. nausea (79.9%) and vomiting (48.7%). Other 
frequently reported GI events were constipation (35.9%) and diarrhea (30.8%). Haematological 
toxicity (anemia: 33.8%, neutrophil count decreased: 32.5% and platelet count decrease: 23.1%) was 
commonly observed. Although ≥grade 3 neutrophil count decreased was common (18.8% of patients), 
febrile neutropenia was reported for 1.7% patients. Both GI and haematological events are known side 
effects of for cytotoxic drugs such as topoisomerase inhibitors. 
Treatment-related AEs or adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were similar to the AEs observed, both 
regarding all-grade events and grade 3-4 events. This is interpreted as most of these were due to the 
chemotherapy-like toxicity, which is also commonly observed with other ADCs. Although heavily pre-
treated, the study population were of good performance status, had with relatively few severe 
symptoms of the underlying advanced breast cancer disease, and tolerated the treatment with 
trastuzumab deruxtecan with an acceptable level of toxicity. 
Adverse events of special interest included ILD/pneumonitis, left ventricular dysfunction, QT 
prolongation, and infusion-related reactions. ILD/pneumonitis is an important identified risk with 
trastuzumab deruxtecan and the Applicant payed special attention to this AESI from the start. In the 
HER2-positive breast cancer pool, 18.1% of the patients had an ILD event while more than grade 3 
events were observed in 3.7% and fatal outcome was observed in 6 patients (2.6%). The incidence of 
treatment-related ILD was lower in the 5.4 mg/kg Pool (13.7%) vs the 6.4 mg/kg pool 
34/137 (24.8%), so there seems to be a dose-risk relationship favouring the lower proposed dose of 
5.4 mg/kg. The median time to onset of ILD was 134.0 days (range: 35-338) and the median duration 
of the first event of ILD was 31.5 days (range: 3-261), so the timing of the event cannot be estimated 
from these data. At the updated DCO, almost half of the patients had recovered and only 1 patient 
with sequalae. The Applicant has analysed potential risk factors for ILD across all tumor types and 
doses among 645 treated patients and found that patients from Japan had a higher incidence of 
treatment-related ILD (any grade) than patients from outside Japan did. Moreover, patients with ≥10 
prior regimens experienced a higher incidence than those who received <10 prior regimens. The 
chosen factors which were analysed are deemed clinically relevant, but the presented analysis does not 
find any clinically relevant risk factors that can be used for the prescriber, since the applied indication 
is not for patients treated with more than 10 prior regimens and the increased number of events in 
Japanese were mostly of low grade; hence, no regulatory consequences are warranted for this finding. 
The Applicant informs that they plan to continue investigating trastuzumab deruxtecan related 
ILD/pneumonitis in ongoing and future clinical studies and they will submit the results of these 
analyses post-authorization in the Periodic benefit risk evaluation reports. The plans for further 
investigation of ILD/pneumonitis risk factors and prognostic factors are endorsed. A precautionary 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 194/210 
 
 
 
statement is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC, including a warning that patients with a history of 
ILD/pneumonitis may be at increased risk of developing ILD/pneumonitis. Furthermore, measures are 
included in the RMP and educational material (see RMP). Overall, the risk of treatment-related ILD is 
the most serious toxicity of trastuzumab deruxtecan and the information about this in the SmPC, 
including the warning section, is acceptable at this point in time. 
There were few events of cardiac failure which were not associated with a reduction in LVEF. The 
limited number of events is reassuring; however, as stated by the Applicant patients with LVEF less 
than 50% were excluded from the study. The Applicant added left ventricular dysfunction as important 
potential risk in the RMP and additional data will become available through PSURs and from the 
ongoing phase 3 trials. Assessment of causality is hampered by the lack of a control group, therefore 
results from the controlled settings will provide further information on causality. A conservative 
approach is needed in the absence of a control group and also given the known class-effect. The 
additional information in section 4.4 is acceptable.  The Applicant provided additional information 
clarifying that no grade Grade 2 LVEF decrease (Resting LVEF 50% to 40%; 10% to 19% decrease 
from baseline) occurred, which explains why no dose modification was performed. The Applicant has 
agreed to include LVEF decrease in the ADR Table in section 4.8 of the SmPC, and to include left 
ventricular dysfunction as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
6% of the patients had an AE of QT prolonged, and only one grade 3 event was symptomatic. 3.4% 
had QT interval prolongation on ECG of more than 60 msec. Overall, the incidence of QT prolongation 
is acceptable and manageable with trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
After review, six patients (2.6%) had an infusion-related reaction (IRR), and all events have resolved 
with sequelae in one patient with 2 IRR events. No discontinuations or dose-reductions were 
necessary, so this event is manageable. 
Overall, there were 12 deaths from any treatment emergent adverse event (4.4%), 3 patients (1.1%) 
died from other causes, and 9 patients (3.3%) died due to unknown causes in the ATT pool (n=275). 
Of the 39 deaths (16.7%) in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg pool, the most frequent cause of death 
was disease progression (n=25, 10.7%). Four deaths were clarified to be treatment-related ILD.   
In the ATT pool, 22.2% had serious adverse events (SAEs), most commonly pertaining to 
pneumonia (2.5%), pneumonitis (2.2%), respiratory failure, and cellulitis (1.8% each). In total, 23 
patients (8.4%) had an SAE related to the respiratory system; however, the rate of SAEs with 
trastuzumab deruxtecan is acceptable considering the heavily treated study population as well as the 
targeted setting and patient population. 
In the ATT pool, the patients commonly had increased ALT (17.6%), AST (43.6%), or ALP (36%) 
compared to baseline. However, these were rarely increased to very high levels, and no cases of 
potential Hy’s Law were determined to be causally associated with trastuzumab deruxtecan. Overall, 
hepatotoxicity was within an acceptable level for most patients and is deemed manageable based on 
available data. 
More patients of ≥65 years of age had a grade ≥3 treatment emergent AEs (38/61 (62.3%) vs. 
90/173 (52.0%), especially regarding fatigue (8/61 [13.1%] vs. 5/173 [2.9%]), and febrile 
neutropenia (4/61 [6.6%] vs. 0%). This is often observed with advanced cancer patients treated with 
chemotherapy, and is within an acceptable level. 
Increased toxicity in white vs Asian patients were observed regarding SAEs (28.6% vs 18.6%), grade 5 
AEs (8.4% vs 2.1%), AEs leading to dose interruption (44.3% vs 31.1%), and neutrophil count 
decrease (43.3% vs 23.5%). Moreover, more white patients had GI toxicity (19.3% vs 8.2%). These 
differences are also reflected in the safety by country and geographic region shown above. However, 
even though the data indicate increased toxicity in white patients and those from the European region, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 195/210 
 
 
 
this may have been biased by differences in the reporting of adverse events between the regions 
among other things, so this is overall not considered problematic. It seems that the awareness of 
possible ILD/pneumonitis was increased in Japan, leading to more low-grade cases, which may then 
not progress into high grade or even fatal events. Hence, comprehensive information about this risk 
with trastuzumab deruxtecan is highly endorsed. The increased toxicity in elderly patients, especially 
regarding fatigue has also previously been shown in cancer trials, and data are adequately reflected in 
the SmPC, section 4.8. The increased toxicity in the patients aged 65 years or older is adequately 
reflected in the SmPC. 
The Applicant stated that 1 subject with moderate hepatic impairment was included in study U201 and 
two additional patients were included in study U301 and U303; however, it is unknown whether these 
patients were treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan. The Applicant plans to obtain data from 10 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan from several ongoing 
clinical studies for an overall assessment of the effect of moderate hepatic impairment on the PK and 
safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan. This is considered acceptable. 
It is agreed that at this time, ADA formation does not seem to cause safety problems, not even serious 
infusion-related reactions. However, this may change with increased use of the drug and overall 
increased exposure, and the Applicant stated that information on ADAs are collected in the ongoing 
phase 3 studies with trastuzumab deruxtecan. This is acceptable. 
Drug-drug interactions do not seem to have clinically meaningful effect on safety. 
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs in the ATT pool was 14.2%, and of these, 12.7% of the 
patients discontinued due to treatment-related AEs. This is similar to the discontinuation rate due to 
AEs in the breast cancer safety pool at safety update DCO (16.2%). Most common AEs leading to 
discontinuation were ILD/pneumonitis in both the BC (9%) and the ATT pool (8%), which reflects the 
safety profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan. Otherwise, only 1-2 patients discontinued per PT, which 
means that the known hematological toxicity rarely led to discontinuations, which is reassuring. 
Overall, the rate of discontinuations is acceptable for the proposed indication and targeted patient 
population. With currently available data, the AEs of ILD/pneumonitis is by far the greatest risk in the 
treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
Dose reductions were common and the rates were similar in both the BC and the ATT pool at safety 
update DCO (~20%). Most frequent AEs leading to dose reductions were fatigue, nausea, and 
decreased neutrophil count, which is consistent with the safety profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan, 
since ILD/pneumonitis should lead to discontinuation of the drug. The overall rate of dose reductions is 
considered acceptable considering the heavily pre-treated study population and the targeted setting 
and patient population. 
Post marketing data from the US is summarized above, and do not give rise to any new safety 
concerns with trastuzumab deruxtecan. The SAEs are considered to reflect the targeted patient 
population and disease. Moreover, the serious and potentially fatal ILD/pneumonitis cases induced are 
of focus for the Applicant, and relevant data about this known risk is adequately described in the 
SmPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Although heavily pre-treated, the study population were of good performance status, with relatively 
few severe symptoms of the underlying advanced breast cancer disease, and tolerated the treatment 
with trastuzumab deruxtecan with an acceptable level of toxicity. Hence, with currently available safety 
data, ILD/pneumonitis is by far the greatest risk in the treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
Moreover, safety data from the phase 3 confirmatory study as well as an updated analyses of risk 
factors and risk mitigation strategies for ILD/pneumonitis should be provided post-authorisation. 
Overall, the safety profile can be considered acceptable in the target population with limited treatment 
options and no major objections on safety are identified precluding marketing authorisation. 
The CHMP considers the following measure (SOB) necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
Submission of interim efficacy and safety data from the ongoing randomised phase 3 U301 study, 
which is requested as a specific obligation to the CMA.

cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 20.12.2019. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that trastuzumab deruxtecan has not been previously authorised in a medicinal 
product in the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for trastuzumab deruxtecan is monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients 
with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti 
HER2 based regimens. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer remains an uncurable disease. Although treatment with anti-
HER2-based regimens has improved the disease outcomes for patients with unresectable locally-
advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, the disease invariably progresses.   
There is no clearly defined standard of care (SOC) for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast 
cancer after two or more anti-HER2-based regimens. Preferred regimens include continuation of HER2-
targeted therapy with trastuzumab or lapatinib in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, such as 
capecitabine. However, efficacy outcomes from current treatments approved in the EU for previously 
treated patients with two or more anti-HER2-based regimens for HER2-positive metastatic breast 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 201/210 
 
 
 
cancer are response rates in the range from 9% to 41%. Results from recent clinical studies (Rugo et 
al., 2019; Murthy et al., 2019) evaluating combination therapies in patients with HER2-positive 
metastatic breast cancer, who had received 2 or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens, underline the 
continued need for efficacy improvement for this patient population as the median PFS was below 6 
months and median OS was reported to be 17.4 to 19.8 months. Therefore, there remains a significant 
unmet medical need for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed despite 
receiving current standard of care, including 2 prior anti-HER2 agents. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study U201 is a global, phase 2, open-label, multicentre, single-arm trial conducted at 72 
study sites, which was fully recruited in approximately 1 year, and the median follow-up was 12.2 
months at the time of the updated data cut-off. A third of the patients were enrolled in the geographic 
regions of either Asia, US or Europe, respectively; hence, predominantly from populations that are 
similar to the European populations. The patient population was heavily pretreated with a median 
number of 5 prior cancer regimens including at least 2 anti-HER2 based regimens at baseline, which is 
considered representative of the target population. The 184 patients with HER2-positive MBC treated 
with trastuzumab deruxtecan at the proposed dose are of main focus in this application. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint of ORR by ICR was 60.3% at the initial data cut and this result was maintained 
at the updated DCO with 12.2 months of follow-up time i.e. 60.9% (95%CI: 53.4; 68). Update DCO 
show that 6% had a CR and 54.9% had a PR, while 36.4% of the patients had SD as best overall 
response.  
The most recent update (DCO 8 June 2020) showed an ORR by IRC of 61.4% (95%CI: 54.0; 68.5). 
The secondary endpoint of duration of response by IRC at update DCO show a median of 14.8 months 
(95%CI: 13.8, 16.9), while further updated DOR was 20.8 months (95%CI: 15; NE). 
The latest updated PFS was 19.4 months (95%CI: 14.1; NE).  
Updated OS data based on a DCO of 08 Jun 2020 with a median duration of follow-up of 20.5 months 
showed a median OS of 24.6 months (95%CI: 23.1, NE).  
The results of the first-in-human study J101 (n=51) support the findings of the pivotal trial, ORR being 
51.0% (95%CI: 36.6, 65.2) and median DoR of 12.7 months (95% CI: 6.7, NE) at time of primary 
data cut-off. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The magnitude of response is considered clinically relevant for this heavily pre-treated study 
population, who have no standard of care. Although sensitivity analyses of ORR are consistent with the 
result of the primary endpoint, no comparative data is available at this point in time. This hampers the 
interpretability of PFS especially. For the same reason, subgroup analyses are also difficult to interpret 
(the ongoing Ph III study is expected to address these). 
The number of patients with inactive brain metastases at baseline is limited (24/184). OS data were 
initially immature with only 10% deaths, but the Applicant has provided updated OS data up of 20.5 
months and was recommended to provide the final OS data post-authorisation after the Study U201 
closes. The interim efficacy data from the ongoing Phase 3 study U301 which are being requested as a 
CHMP assessment report

Page 202/210 
 
 
 
specific obligation to the marketing authorisation (see “Specific Obligation to complete post-
authorisation measures for the conditional marketing authorisation”) are expected to address the 
above uncertainties. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost all of the patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) in the pivotal study U201 at 
safety update DCO and most of these were treatment-related. Gastrointestinal events were the most 
frequent AEs for trastuzumab deruxtecan, with incidences of 79.9% for nausea and 48.7% for vomiting 
based on the pooled data at the safety update DCO. Other frequently reported gastrointestinal events 
were constipation (35.9%) and diarrhoea (30.8%). These occurred early upon treatment (nausea and 
vomiting within first week), were mostly grade 1 and 2 and resolved without dose modifications.  
Next to GI events, hematological events (anemia: 33.8%, neutrophil count decreased: 32.5% and 
platelet count decrease: 23.1%) were commonly observed AEs. Most events occurred within the first 
3 months and were grade 1 or 2. The highest frequency of ≥grade 3 events was neutrophil count 
decreased (18.8% of patients). Febrile neutropenia was reported for 1.7% patients. In general, 
haematological events were managed with dose interruptions and dose reductions or supportive 
management. Both GI and haematological events are known side effects of for cytotoxic drugs such as 
topoisomerase inhibitors. 
≥Grade 3 events were reported in 54.7% of patients, predominantly neutrophil count decrease 
(18.8%) and anaemia (9.0%).  
Adverse events of special interest of clinical interest included ILD/pneumonitis, LVEF decrease, QT 
prolongation and IRR in the HER2-positive breast cancer pool, which were selected based on class 
effects. A total of 15% of the patients had an ILD/pneumonitis event and fatal events were observed in 
2.6%. In total, 16.9% of patients met the laboratory criteria for grade 2 LVEF decrease, and none were 
grade 3 or higher. 
Overall, serious adverse events occurred in 23.2% of patients and there were 16.7% deaths during 
follow-up. Most frequently occurring SAEs were pneumonitis (2.6%), pneumonia, and respiratory 
failure (2.1% each). TEAEs were considered the primary cause of death in 3.0% of patients.  
Treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs occurred in 16.2% of patients in the BC pool and the most 
common were ILD/pneumonitis in both the BC (9%) and the ATT pool (8%). 
There were more ≥grade 3 events in patients ≥65 years, especially fatigue and febrile neutropenia. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The median exposure in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool was 9.82 months (range: 0.7-37.1) for 
the HER2+MBC pool (n=234) (Update safety DCO 01 Aug 2019) with 69/234 (29.5%) being treated 
for > 12 months. Therefore, long-term safety data is limited. Causality assessment of unfavourable 
events is impaired by the single arm design of the studies. 
The knowledge about ILD/pneumonitis is still limited regarding the recovery rate and clinically relevant 
risk factors. Moreover, patients with a history of noninfectious ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids 
were excluded from the trial due to a potential increased risk of ILD. Proposed mitigating strategies for 
ILD (section 4.2 and 4.4 SmPC, DHPC) appear adequate to reduce the risk of severe/fatal ILD for these 
patients.

No safety data are available in patients with severe renal impairment and safety data in patients 
>75 years is limited. 
No safety data are available in patients with moderate/severe hepatic impairment whereas the safety 
profile may be different as the drug is primarily hepatically eliminated. Grade 1 and Grade 2 elevations 
in ALT and AST were frequently reported. Although no severe hepatic toxicities were observed, the 
impact may be more relevant in patients with moderate/severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, a PK 
and safety study in patients with moderate hepatic impairment is required (see RMP).  
Long-term safety data is limited and a safety update with a focus on the AESI of ILD is expected with 
the efficacy update. In approximately 2 years’ time, the interim PFS results will be available from the 
ongoing phase 3 randomised controlled study with trastuzumab deruxtecan versus investigator’s 
choice (Study U301), and it is considered that the benefits shown now could outweigh the risks of 
conditionally approving trastuzumab deruxtecan before comparative confirmatory data are available.  
To address the limitations around safety data, interim safety data from the ongoing Phase 3 study 
U301 are being requested as a specific obligation to the marketing authorisation (see “Specific 
Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the conditional marketing authorisation”).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan monotherapy was studied in a single-arm phase 2 study with 184 advanced 
or metastatic breast cancer patients, who had received at least 2 lines of therapy. The study 
population is in general representative of the target population and the limited number of patients with 
brain metastases does not raise a major issue on efficacy.  
As the basis for this application is a single-arm trial, several aspects need explicit consideration. In this 
respect, the natural course of the target disease as well as the target population are considered 
adequately defined. Updated efficacy results for trastuzumab deruxtecan based on a median follow-up 
of 20.5 months, confirm the initial analysis. The results showed a significant antitumor activity (ORR by 
IRC of 61.4%) that seems better than reported for currently used anti-HER2 based regimens in this 
setting with no clear SOC. Responses appear durable (updated median DoR: 20.8 months) and 
updated median PFS was 19.4 months.  The obtained ORR and DoR should be compared to the fact, 
that there is no clear standard of care in the proposed setting, and efficacy of the available treatments 
used show limited efficacy with a reported median DoR of 6.0 -8.5 months and median PFS of 4.9 – 
7.8 months (the NALA, SOPHIA, and HER2CLIMB studies). The substantial longer DoR together with 
the high ORR support a major therapeutic advantage despite the inherent limitations related to cross-
study comparisons. The difference is as such that it is considered to overcome the remaining 
uncertainties related to indirect comparisons and high censoring rate.  
Censoring rates remained high at the time of DCO 08 Jun 2020 with a median follow-up of 20.5 
months, for DoR: 65.2% and for PFS: 62.0%. In order to reason out what the likely DoR for this study 
would be, sensitivity analyses were requested with clinical progression and investigator determined PD 
counted as events rather than censored, and the median DoR for the EMA DCO is estimated to be 14.6 
months (95%CI 10.3, 18.2). Given that it is reasonable to presume that these patients may have 
showed signs of progression, an event based on investigator or ICR progression could be a better 
measure of efficacy, so this may be a more realistic estimate than the 20 months that was first 
estimated in the EMA DCO. However, a median DoR of 14 months in combination with an ORR of 
around 60% is just as well considered a major therapeutic advantage (MTA) over existing therapies in 
the target population. 
As the initial results are to some extent confirmed by an update of efficacy data and various sensitivity 
analyses, the ORR and DoR are likely to translate into a clinically meaningful benefit for a population 
with median OS of 3 years. The clinical benefit in terms of survival and efficacy in patients with brain 
metastasis need to be confirmed by the ongoing phase III U301 trial proposed as specific obligations in 
case of a CMA.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021

Efficacy results need to be weighed against the safety profile, which is mainly characterised by 
gastrointestinal and haematological events, which were generally manageable and infrequently led to 
treatment discontinuation. Although the single arm trial design hampers a causality assessment of 
adverse events, the safety profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan largely resembles that of other 
trastuzumab-based regimens combined with chemotherapy. Grade 2 LVEF was observed and because 
decrease in LVEF is a class effect, left ventricular dysfunction was added as an important identified risk 
for trastuzumab deruxtecan in the RMP.   
The major safety concern of trastuzumab deruxtecan is the risk of ILD/pneumonitis (13.7%), which 
frequently led to drug discontinuation and with fatal events being reported (2.6%). The incidence is 
higher than reported for other trastuzumab-based products and may be related both to the antibody 
and the released drug; however, when early recognised, low grade ILD/pneumonitis is manageable 
with dose modification and corticosteroid treatment in line with clinical treatment guidelines (see 
section 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC), more safety data will be available from the ongoing studies with 
trastuzumab deruxtecan, to better characterize the safety profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan within a 
reasonable timeframe.  Further safety data such as long-term safety, a PK and safety study in patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment will be provided post authorisation (see RMP and Annex II).  
To contextualize, the Applicant is seeking an indication in a setting, where there is no standard of care 
available and currently used treatment regimens show limited efficacy. Hence, there is a high unmet 
medical need for further treatment options for the targeted patient population in the proposed setting, 
and trastuzumab deruxtecan is considered to address this unmet need. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The reported ORR and duration of response are considered promising in the target population that 
have already received two anti-HER2 based regimens and who have no clear SOC. The effect size is as 
such that it is sufficient to overcome the uncertainties related to the lack of an active comparator arm 
and thus the indirect comparisons. Overall, the results indicate a likely clinical benefit of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan in terms of time dependent endpoints.   
The adverse events are mostly mild, reversible upon management and/or dose modifications and 
comparable to what is known from trastuzumab-based regimens combined with chemotherapy. Further 
PK and safety data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment will be obtained post-approval.  
The benefit/risk balance is currently positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease. Breast 
cancer is the most commonly diagnosed female cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer 
death in women. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/2446/2021  
Page 206/210 
 
 
 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed in Section 3.7.2. . 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. 
The ongoing Phase 3 Study U301 is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan vs Investigator’s choice in patients with HER2-positive MBC previously 
treated with TDM1 (i.e. 3rd line treatment), n=600 planned, PFS projected Q1 2022. A total of 
411 out of 600 subjects planned are enrolled as of 08 Jun 2020 in Study U301. Previously, 
329/600 subjects planned were enrolled as of 13 Mar 2020, therefore 82 new patients were 
enrolled within a period of about 3 months. A total of 189 patients are needed to meet the 
planned 600 subjects. Therefore, the planning for the last subject to be enrolled (Feb 2021) is 
considered reasonable. It is expected that granting of a CMA will not impact the enrolment of 
the phase 3 study U301 and with an estimated DCO of Q3 2021, results are expected to be 
available in a reasonable time frame. Hence, Study U301 serves as a confirmatory study, with a 
study population similar to the currently evaluated study population from the pivotal Study 
U201. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as 
there is no clearly defined SoC and reported ORRs of therapeutic regimens administered after 2 
or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens range approximately from 9% to 41%, while 
trastuzumab deruxtecan showed a confirmed ORR of 60.9% (95% CI: 53.4, 68.0) in Study 
U201 with DoR of 14.8 months (95% CI: 13.8, 16.9). Additionally, the median PFS with 
currently available treatment options is in the range of 3.3 to 7.8 months and a need for better 
treatments exist that prolong PFS and ultimately OS. ORR and DoR are substantially 
higher/longer for trastuzumab deruxtecan than reported for other medicinal products in the 
target population with at least two prior lines of anti-HER2 treatment. The MTA is therefore 
considered demonstrated. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
ORR and DoR are substantially higher/longer for trastuzumab deruxtecan than reported for 
other medicinal products in the target population with at least two prior lines of anti-HER2 
treatment. The difference is as such that it is considered to overcome the remaining 
uncertainties related to indirect comparisons and high censoring rate. The safety profile can be 
considered acceptable in the target population with limited treatment options. It is considered 
that the benefits shown now outweigh the risks of conditionally approving trastuzumab 
deruxtecan before comparative confirmatory data are available. 
3.8.  Conclusions

Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥65 years of age (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild [creatinine clearance (CrCL) >60–90 mL/min], 
moderate (CrCL 30–60 mL/min) or severe (CrCL 15–<30 mL/min) renal impairment. Enfortumab 
vedotin has not been evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease (CrCL <15 mL/min) (see 
section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment [total bilirubin of 1 to 1.5 × 
upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST any, or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN]. Enfortumab 
vedotin has only been evaluated in a limited number of patients with moderate hepatic impairment and 
has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of enfortumab vedotin in the paediatric population for the indication of locally 
advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.   
Method of administration 
Padcev is for intravenous use. The recommended dose must be administered by intravenous infusion 
over 30 minutes. Enfortumab vedotin must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus 
injection. 
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6.

Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Skin reactions 
Skin reactions are associated with enfortumab vedotin as a result of enfortumab vedotin binding to 
Nectin-4 expressed in the skin. Fever or flu-like symptoms may be the first sign of a severe skin 
reaction, and patients should be observed, if this occurs.  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mild to moderate skin reactions, predominantly maculopapular rash, have been reported (see section 
4.8). Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including SJS and TEN, with fatal outcome have also 
occurred in patients treated with enfortumab vedotin, predominantly during the first cycle of 
treatment. In clinical trials, the median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 0.6 months (range: 
0.1 to 6.4). 
Patients should be monitored starting with the first cycle and throughout treatment for skin reactions. 
Appropriate treatment such as topical corticosteroids and antihistamines can be considered for mild to 
moderate skin reactions. For suspected SJS or TEN, or in case of bullous lesions onset, withhold 
treatment immediately and refer to specialised care; histologic confirmation, including consideration 
of multiple biopsies, is critical to early recognition, as diagnosis and intervention can improve 
prognosis. Permanently discontinue Padcev for confirmed SJS or TEN, Grade 4 or recurrent severe 
skin reactions. For Grade 2 worsening, Grade 2 with fever or Grade 3 skin reactions, treatment should 
be withheld until Grade ≤1 and referral for specialised care should be considered. Treatment should be 
resumed at the same dose level or consider dose reduction by one dose level (see section 4.2). 
Pneumonitis/ILD 
Severe, life-threatening or fatal pneumonitis/ILD have occurred in patients treated with enfortumab 
vedotin (see section 4.8).  
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms indicative of pneumonitis/ILD such as hypoxia, cough, 
dyspnea or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Corticosteroids should be administered for 
Grade ≥ 2 events (e.g., initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper). 
Withhold Padcev for Grade 2 pneumonitis/ILD and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue 
Padcev for Grade ≥3 pneumonitis/ILD (see section 4.2). 
Hyperglycaemia 
Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including fatal events, occurred in patients with and 
without pre-existing diabetes mellitus, treated with enfortumab vedotin (see section 4.8). 
Hyperglycaemia occurred more frequently in patients with pre-existing hyperglycaemia or a high body 
mass index (≥30 kg/m2). Patients with baseline HbA1c ≥8% were excluded from clinical trials. Blood 
glucose levels should be monitored prior to dosing and periodically throughout the course of treatment 
as clinically indicated in patients with or at risk for diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia. If blood 
glucose is elevated >13.9 mmol/L (>250 mg/dL), Padcev should be withheld until blood glucose is 
≤13.9 mmol/L (≤250 mg/dL) and treat as appropriate (see section 4.2). 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Peripheral neuropathy, predominantly peripheral sensory neuropathy, has occurred with enfortumab 
vedotin, including Grade ≥3 reactions (see section 4.8). Patients with preexisting peripheral 
neuropathy Grade ≥2 were excluded from clinical trials. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of 
new or worsening peripheral neuropathy as these patients may require a delay, dose reduction or 
discontinuation of enfortumab vedotin (see Table 1). Padcev should be permanently discontinued for 
Grade ≥3 peripheral neuropathy (see section 4.2). 
Ocular disorders 
Ocular disorders, predominantly dry eye, have occurred in patients treated with enfortumab vedotin 
(see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for ocular disorders. Consider artificial tears for 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
prophylaxis of dry eye and referral for ophthalmologic evaluation if ocular symptoms do not resolve 
or worsen. 
Infusion site extravasation  
Skin and soft tissue injury following enfortumab vedotin administration has been observed when 
extravasation occurred (see section 4.8). Ensure good venous access prior to starting Padcev and 
monitor for possible infusion site extravasation during administration. If extravasation occurs, stop the 
infusion and monitor for adverse reactions. 
Embryo-foetal toxicity and contraception 
Pregnant women should be informed of the potential risk to a foetus (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). 
Females of reproductive potential should be advised to have a pregnancy test within 7 days prior to 
starting treatment with enfortumab vedotin, to use effective contraception during treatment and for at 
least 12 months after stopping treatment. Men being treated with enfortumab vedotin are advised not 
to father a child during treatment and for up to 9 months following the last dose of Padcev. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Formal drug-drug interaction studies with enfortumab vedotin have not been conducted. Concomitant 
administration of enfortumab vedotin and CYP3A4 (substrates) metabolised medicinal products, has 
no clinically relevant risk of inducing pharmacokinetic interactions (see section 5.2). 
Effects of other medicinal products on enfortumab vedotin 
CYP3A4 inhibitors, substrates or inducers 
Based on physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, concomitant use of enfortumab 
vedotin with ketoconazole (a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitor) is predicted to increase 
unconjugated MMAE Cmax and AUC exposure to a minor extent, with no change in ADC exposure. 
Caution is advised in case of concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Patients receiving 
concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. boceprevir, clarithromycin, cobicistat, indinavir, 
itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, 
voriconazole) should be monitored more closely for signs of toxicities. 
Unconjugated MMAE is not predicted to alter the AUC of concomitant medicines that are CYP3A4 
substrates (e.g. midazolam). 
Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John's wort 
[Hypericum perforatum]) may decrease the exposure of unconjugated MMAE with moderate effect 
(see section 5.2). 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to 
initiating treatment. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception 
during treatment and for at least 12 months after stopping treatment. Men being treated with 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enfortumab vedotin are advised not to father a child during treatment and for up to 9 months following 
the last dose of Padcev. 
Pregnancy 
Padcev can cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women based upon findings from animal 
studies. Embryo-foetal development studies in female rats have shown that intravenous administration 
of enfortumab vedotin resulted in reduced numbers of viable foetuses, reduced litter size, and 
increased early resorptions (see section 5.3). Padcev is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether enfortumab vedotin is excreted in human milk. A risk to breast-fed children 
cannot be excluded. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during Padcev treatment and for at least 6 
months after the last dose. 
Fertility 
In rats, repeat dose administration of enfortumab vedotin, resulted in testicular toxicity and may alter 
male fertility. MMAE has been shown to have aneugenic properties (see section 5.3). Therefore, men 
being treated with this medicinal product are advised to have sperm samples frozen and stored before 
treatment. There are no data on the effect of Padcev on human fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Padcev has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immunogenicity 
A total of 590 patients were tested for immunogenicity to enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg; 15 patients 
were confirmed to be positive at baseline for anti-drug antibody (ADA), and in patients that were 
negative at baseline (N=575), a total of 16 (2.8%) were positive postbaseline (13 transiently and 3 
persistently). Due to the limited number of patients with antibodies against Padcev, no conclusions can 
be drawn concerning a potential effect of immunogenicity on efficacy, safety or pharmacokinetics.  
Skin reactions 
In clinical studies, skin reactions occurred in 55% (375) of the 680 patients treated with enfortumab 
vedotin 1.25 mg/kg. Severe (Grade 3 or 4) skin reactions occurred in 13% (85) of patients and a 
majority of these reactions included maculo-papular rash, rash erythematous, rash or drug eruption. 
The median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 0.62 months (range: 0.1 to 6.4 months). Serious 
skin reactions occurred in 3.8% (26) of patients. 
In the EV-201 (N=214) clinical study, of the patients who experienced skin reactions, 75% had 
complete resolution and 14% had partial improvement (see section 4.4). 
Pneumonitis/ILD 
In clinical studies, pneumonitis occurred in 15 (2.2%) and ILD occurred in 2 (0.3%) of the 680 
patients treated with enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg. Less than 1% of patients experienced severe 
(Grade 3-4) pneumonitis or ILD. Pneumonitis or ILD led to discontinuation of enfortumab vedotin in 
0.1% and 0.3% of patients, respectively. There were no deaths from ILD or pneumonitis. The median 
time to onset of any grade pneumonitis or ILD was 3.6 months (range: 0.8 to 6.0 months) and the 
median duration was 1.4 months (range: 0.2 to 27.5 months). Of the 17 patients who experienced 
pneumonitis or ILD, 6 (35.3%) had resolution of symptoms. 
Hyperglycaemia 
In clinical studies, hyperglycaemia (blood glucose >13.9 mmol/L) occurred in 14% (98) of the 680 
patients treated with enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg. Serious events of hyperglycaemia occurred in 
2.2% of patients, 7% of patients developed severe (Grade 3-4) hyperglycaemia and 0.3% of patients 
experienced fatal events, one event each of hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. The incidence 
of Grade 3-4 hyperglycaemia increased consistently in patients with higher body mass index and in 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients with higher baseline haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c). The median time to onset of hyperglycemia 
was 0.6 months (range: 0.1 to 20.3).  
In the EV-201 (N=214) clinical study, at the time of their last evaluation, 61% of patients had 
complete resolution, and 19% of patients had partial improvement (see section 4.4). 
Peripheral neuropathy 
In clinical studies peripheral neuropathy occurred in 52% (352) of the 680 patients treated with 
enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg. Four percent of patients experienced severe (Grade 3-4) peripheral 
neuropathy including sensory and motor events. The median time to onset of Grade ≥2 was 4.6 months 
(range: 0.1 to 15.8).  
In the EV-201 (N=214) clinical study, at the time of their last evaluation, 19% of patients had 
complete resolution, and 39% of patients had partial improvement (see section 4.4).  
Ocular disorders 
In clinical studies, 30% of patients experienced dry eye during treatment with enfortumab vedotin 
1.25 mg/kg. Treatment was interrupted in 1.3% of patients and 0.1% of patients permanently 
discontinued treatment due to dry eye. Severe (Grade 3) dry eye only occurred in 3 patients (0.4%). 
The median time to onset of dry eye was 1.7 months (range: 0 to 19.1 months) (see section 4.4).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
There is no known antidote for overdosage with enfortumab vedotin. In case of overdosage, the patient 
should be closely monitored for adverse reactions, and supportive treatment should be administered as 
appropriate taking into consideration the half-life of 3.6 days (ADC) and 2.6 days (MMAE). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, 
ATC code: L01FX13 
Mechanism of action 
Enfortumab vedotin is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) targeting Nectin-4, an adhesion protein 
located on the surface of the urothelial cancer cells. It is comprised of a fully human IgG1-kappa 
antibody conjugated to the microtubule-disrupting agent MMAE via a protease-cleavable 
maleimidocaproyl valine-citrulline linker. Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of 
enfortumab vedotin is due to the binding of the ADC to Nectin-4-expressing cells, followed by 
internalisation of the ADC-Nectin-4 complex, and the release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage. 
11 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Release of MMAE disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, subsequently inducing cell cycle 
arrest and apoptotic cell death. MMAE released from enfortumab vedotin targeted cells can diffuse 
into nearby Nectin-4 low-expressing cells resulting in cytotoxic cell death. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
At the recommended dose of 1.25 mg/kg, enfortumab vedotin did not prolong the mean QTc interval 
to any clinically relevant extent based on ECG data from a study in patients with advanced urothelial 
cancer. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Metastatic urothelial cancer 
EV-301 
The efficacy of Padcev was evaluated in study EV-301, an open-label, randomised, phase 3, 
multicentre study that enrolled 608 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who 
have previously received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and a programmed death receptor 1 
(PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor. The primary endpoint of the study was 
Overall Survival (OS) and secondary endpoints included Progression Free Survival (PFS) and 
Objective Response Rate (ORR) [PFS and ORR were evaluated by investigator assessment using 
RECIST v1.1]. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg on 
Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle, or one of the following chemotherapies as decided by the 
investigator: docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (38%), paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (36%) or vinflunine 320 mg/m2 (25%) 
on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.  
Patients were excluded from the study if they had active CNS metastases, ongoing sensory or motor 
neuropathy ≥ Grade 2, known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (HIV 1 or 2), 
active Hepatitis B or C, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as HbA1c ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with 
associated diabetes symptoms. 
The median age was 68 years (range: 30 to 88 years), 77% were male, and most patients were White 
(52%) or Asian (33%). All patients had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 
status of 0 (40%) or 1 (60%). Ninety-five percent (95%) of patients had metastatic disease and 5% had 
locally advanced disease. Eighty percent of patients had visceral metastases including 31% with liver 
metastases. Seventy-six percent of patients had urothelial carcinoma/transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) 
histology, 14% had urothelial carcinoma mixed and approximately 10% had other histologic variants. 
A total of 76 (13%) patients had received ≥3 lines of prior systemic therapy. Fifty-two percent (314) of 
patients had received prior PD-1 inhibitor, 47% (284) had received prior PD-L1 inhibitor, and an 
additional 1% (9) patients had received both PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. Only 18% (111) of patients 
had a response to prior therapy with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. Sixty-three percent (383) of patients 
had received prior cisplatin-based regimens, 26% (159) had received prior carboplatin-based 
regimens, and an additional 11% (65) had received both cisplatin and carboplatin-based regimens. 
Table 4 summarizes the efficacy results for the EV-301 study, after a median follow-up time of 11.1

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
enfortumab vedotin in all subsets of the paediatric population in urothelial cancer (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
The mean estimate of steady-state volume of distribution of ADC was 12.8 L following 1.25 mg/kg of 
enfortumab vedotin. In vitro, the binding of MMAE to human plasma proteins ranged from 68% to 
82%. MMAE is not likely to displace or to be displaced by highly protein-bound medicinal products. 
In vitro studies indicate that MMAE is a substrate of P-glycoprotein. 
Biotransformation 
A small fraction of MMAE released from enfortumab vedotin is metabolised. In vitro data indicate 
that the metabolism of MMAE occurs primarily via oxidation by CYP3A4. 
Elimination 
The mean clearance of ADC and unconjugated MMAE in patients was 0.11 L/h and 2.11 L/h, 
respectively. ADC elimination exhibited a multi-exponential decline with a half-life of 3.6 days. 
Elimination of MMAE appeared to be limited by its rate of release from enfortumab vedotin. MMAE 
elimination exhibited a multi-exponential decline with a half-life of 2.6 days. 
Excretion 
The excretion of MMAE occurs mainly in faeces with a smaller proportion in urine. After a single 
dose of another ADC that contained MMAE, approximately 24% of the total MMAE administered 
was recovered in faeces and urine as unchanged MMAE over a 1-week period. The majority of 
recovered MMAE was excreted in faeces (72%). A similar excretion profile is expected for MMAE 
after enfortumab vedotin administration. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that age [range: 24 to 90 years; 60% (450/748) 
>65 years, 19% (143/748) >75 years] does not have a clinically meaningful effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin. 
Race and gender 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, race [69% (519/748) White, 21% (158/748) Asian, 1% 
(10/748) Black and 8% (61/748) others or unknown] and gender [73% (544/748) male] do not have a 
clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of ADC and unconjugated MMAE were evaluated after the administration of 
1.25 mg/kg of enfortumab vedotin to patients with mild (CrCL >60–90 mL/min; n=272), moderate 
(CrCL 30–60 mL/min; n=315) and severe (CrCL 15–<30 mL/min; n=25) renal impairment. No 
significant differences in AUC exposure of ADC or unconjugated MMAE were observed in patients 
with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. 
Enfortumab vedotin has not been evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease (CrCL 
<15 mL/min). 
Hepatic impairment 
Based on population pharmacokinetics analysis using data from clinical studies in patients with 
metastatic UC, there was no significant differences in ADC exposure and a 37% increase in 
unconjugated MMAE AUC were observed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin of 
1 to 1.5 × ULN and AST any, or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, n=65) compared to patients 
with normal hepatic function. Enfortumab vedotin has only been studied in a limited number of 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment (n=3) and has not been evaluated in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment. The effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN 
and AST any) or liver transplantation on the pharmacokinetics of ADC or unconjugated MMAE is 
unknown.  
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling predictions 
Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin with ketoconazole (a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A 
inhibitor) is predicted to increase unconjugated MMAE Cmax and AUC exposure to a minor extent, 
with no change in ADC exposure. 
Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin with rifampin (a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducer) 
is predicted to decrease unconjugated MMAE Cmax and AUC exposure with moderate effect, with no 
change in ADC exposure. The full impact of rifampin on the Cmax of MMAE may be underestimated 
in the PBPK model. 
Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin is predicted not to affect exposure to midazolam (a sensitive 
CYP3A substrate). In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that MMAE inhibits 
CYP3A4/5 but not other CYP450 isoforms. MMAE did not induce major CYP450 enzymes in human 
hepatocytes.  
In vitro studies 
In vitro studies indicate that MMAE is a substrate and not an inhibitor of the efflux transporter 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In vitro studies determined that MMAE was not a substrate of breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), organic anion 
transporting polypeptide 1B1 or 1B3 (OATP1B1 or OATP1B3), organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), 
or organic anion transporter 1 or 3 (OAT1 or OAT3). MMAE was not an inhibitor of the bile salt 
export pump (BSEP), P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3 at 
clinically relevant concentrations. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
Genotoxicity studies showed that MMAE had no discernible genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation 
test in bacteria (Ames test) or in a L5178Y TK+/- mouse lymphoma mutation assay. MMAE did 
induce chromosomal aberrations in the micronucleus test in rats which is consistent with the 
pharmacological action of microtubule-disrupting agents. 
Skin lesions were noted in repeat dose studies in rats (4- and 13-weeks) and in monkeys (4-weeks). 
The skin changes were fully reversible by the end of a 6-week recovery period. 
Hyperglycaemia reported in the clinical studies was absent in both the rat and monkey toxicity studies 
and there were no histopathological findings in the pancreas of either species. 
Foetal toxicity (reduced litter size or complete litter loss) was observed and decrease in the litter size 
was reflected in an increase in early resorptions. Mean foetal body weight in the surviving foetuses at 
the 2 mg/kg dose level were reduced compared with control. 
Enfortumab vedotin associated foetal skeletal variations were considered developmental delays. A 
dose of 2 mg/kg (approximately similar to the exposure at the recommended human dose) resulted in 
maternal toxicity, embryo-foetal lethality and structural malformations that included gastroschisis, 
malrotated hindlimb, absent forepaw, malpositioned internal organs and fused cervical arch. 
Additionally, skeletal anomalies (asymmetric, fused, incompletely ossified, and misshapen sternebrae, 
misshapen cervical arch, and unilateral ossification of the thoracic centra) and decreased foetal weight 
were observed. 
Testicular toxicity observed, only in rats, was partially reversed by the end of a 24-week recovery 
period.

Follow procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products. 
Use appropriate aseptic technique for reconstitution and preparation of dosing solutions. 
Calculate the recommended dose based on the patient’s weight to determine the number and 
strength (20 mg or 30 mg) of vials needed. 
Reconstitute each vial as follows and, if possible, direct the stream of sterile water for injection 
along the walls of the vial and not directly onto the lyophilized powder: 
a.  20 mg vial:  Add 2.3 mL of sterile water for injection, resulting in 10 mg/mL enfortumab 
vedotin.  
b.  30 mg vial:  Add 3.3 mL of sterile water for injection, resulting in 10 mg/mL enfortumab 
vedotin. 
Slowly swirl each vial until the contents are completely dissolved. Allow the reconstituted 
vial(s) to settle for at least 1 minute until the bubbles are gone. Do not shake the vial. 
Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discolouration. The reconstituted 
solution should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to light yellow and free of visible 
particles. Discard any vial with visible particles or discolouration. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dilution in infusion bag 
7.  Withdraw the calculated dose amount of reconstituted solution from the vial(s) and transfer into 
8. 
an infusion bag.  
Dilute enfortumab vedotin with dextrose 50 mg/mL (5%), sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) or 
Lactated Ringer’s solution for injection. The infusion bag size should allow enough solvent to 
achieve a final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL to 4 mg/mL enfortumab vedotin.  
Diluted dosing solution of enfortumab vedotin is compatible with intravenous infusion bags composed 
of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ethylvinyl acetate, polyolefin such as polypropylene (PP), or IV bottles 
comprised of polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified, and infusion sets

reaction worsens. If you have any further questions about your treatment, please contact your doctor. 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
This patient is being treated with Padcev (enfortumab vedotin), which can cause severe skin 
reactions, including SJS and TEN (predominantly during the first cycle of treatment).  
Symptoms include rash or itching that continues to get worse or comes back after treatment, 
skin blistering or peeling, painful sores or ulcers in mouth or nose, throat, or genital area, fever 
or flu-like symptoms or swollen lymph nodes.  
Fever or flu-like symptoms may be the first sign of a skin reaction. Patients should be monitored 
starting with the first cycle and throughout treatment for skin reactions. Topical 
corticosteroids/antihistamines can be considered for mild to moderate skin reactions. 
If SJS or TEN is suspected or if bullous lesions occur, immediately withhold treatment and 
refer for specialised care; histologic confirmation is critical to early recognition, as diagnosis 
and intervention can improve prognosis.  
If SJS or TEN, Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions occur, permanently discontinue 
treatment.  
•  Withhold treatment for Grade 2 with fever, worsening Grade 2 or Grade 3 skin reactions until 
Grade ≤1 and resume at the same dose level or consider dose reduction by one dose level; 
consider referral to specialised care. 
Please contact the patient’s Haematologist/Oncologist for more information and consult the Product 
Information for enfortumab vedotin available at https://www.ema.europa.eu/.

WHAT PADCEV IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Padcev contains the active substance enfortumab vedotin which is made up of a monoclonal antibody 
linked to a substance intended to kill cancer cells. The monoclonal antibody recognises certain cancer 
cells and delivers the substance to the cancer cells. 
This medicine is used in adults to treat a kind of cancer called bladder cancer (urothelial carcinoma). 
People get Padcev when their cancer has spread or cannot be taken out by surgery. 
Padcev is given to people that have received an immunotherapy medicine and also received a 
chemotherapy-containing platinum medicine.

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Instructions for preparation and administration 
Reconstitution in single-dose vial 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Follow procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products. 
Use appropriate aseptic technique for reconstitution and preparation of dosing solutions. 
Calculate the recommended dose based on the patient’s weight to determine the number and 
strength (20 mg or 30 mg) of vials needed. 
Reconstitute each vial as follows and, if possible, direct the stream of sterile water for injection 
along the walls of the vial and not directly onto the lyophilized powder: 
a. 
20 mg vial: Add 2.3 mL of sterile water for injection, resulting in 10 mg/mL enfortumab 
vedotin.  
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b. 
30 mg vial: Add 3.3 mL of sterile water for injection, resulting in 10 mg/mL enfortumab 
vedotin. 
5. 
6. 
Slowly swirl each vial until the contents are completely dissolved. Allow the reconstituted 
vial(s) to settle for at least 1 minute until the bubbles are gone. Do not shake the vial. 
Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discolouration. The reconstituted 
solution should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to light yellow and free of visible 
particles. Discard any vial with visible particles or discolouration. 
Dilution in infusion bag 
7.  Withdraw the calculated dose amount of reconstituted solution from the vial(s) and transfer into 
8. 
an infusion bag.  
Dilute enfortumab vedotin with dextrose 50 mg/mL (5%), sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) or 
Lactated Ringer’s solution for injection. The infusion bag size should allow enough solvent to 
achieve a final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL to 4 mg/mL enfortumab vedotin.  
Diluted dosing solution of enfortumab vedotin is compatible with intravenous infusion bags composed 
of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ethylvinyl acetate, polyolefin such as polypropylene (PP), or IV bottles 
comprised of polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified, and infusion sets 
composed of PVC with either plasticizer (bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) or tris(2-ethylhexyl) 
trimellitate (TOTM)), PE and with filter membranes (pore size : 0.2-1.2 μm) composed of 
polyethersulfone, polyvinylidene difluoride, or mixed cellulose esters.  
9.  Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion. Do not shake the bag.  
10.  Visually inspect the infusion bag for any particulate matter or discolouration prior to use. The 
reconstituted solution should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to light yellow and free 
of visible particles. Do not use the infusion bag if particulate matter or discolouration is 
observed. 
11.  Discard any unused portion left in the single-dose vials. 
Administration 
12.  Administer the infusion over 30 minutes through an intravenous line. Do not administer as an 
intravenous push or bolus. 
No incompatibilities have been observed with closed system transfer device composed of acrylonitrile 
butadiene styrene(ABS), acrylic, activated charcoal, ethylene propylene diene monomer, methacrylate 
ABS, polycarbonate, polyisoprene, polyoxymethylene, PP, silicone, stainless steel, thermoplastic 
elastomer for reconstituted solution. 
13.  Do not co-administer other medicinal products through the same infusion line. 
14. 
In-line filters or syringe filters (the pore size: 0.2-1.2 μm, recommended materials: 
polyethersulfone, polyvinylidene difluoride, mixed cellulose esters) are recommended to be 
used during administration. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Disposal 
Padcev is for single use only.  
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Rationale for submitting an updated Risk Management Plan (RMP): This Esbriet 
E.U. RMP Version 12.1 is submitted in response to a request raised in the 
Assessment Report for procedure EMEA/H/C/002154/II/0074, which is the variation to 
extend the authorized indication from “treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)” to “treatment of adult patients with IPF.” The list of 
significant changes with the corresponding rationale is provided below.
Summary of significant changes in this RMP:

Part II, Module SVII.3; Part II, Module SVIII; Part III, Module III.1:  The following 
safety concerns have been removed:
– Gastrointestinal symptoms
–
–
–
Risk of medication error in patients transferring between capsules and tablets
Patients with QT prolongation
Patients with underlying specific cardiac events
None of these safety concerns are subject to additional pharmacovigilance activities 
and no additional risk minimisation measures are in place.  The Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) describes the routine risk minimization measures in 
place for Gastrointestinal symptoms, and these symptoms are well-recognized and
well-characterized.  Following continued post-marketing monitoring by the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder (MAH), no new safety signal has emerged for the other safety 
concerns.  Therefore, it is considered that at this stage of the product life cycle 
these safety concerns can be removed from the RMP.  The MAH will continue to 
monitor such events via routine pharmacovigilance and present an evaluation of any
newly emerging data via the appropriate regulatory channels.
Part V: As per RMP template guidance, inclusion of references to the routine risk 
minimisation measures in the Patient Information Leaflet for the important identified 
risks (photosensitivity reaction and rash and drug-induced liver injury [DILI]) in 
Tables 15 and 17, respectively, and Part VI: Summary of the RMP.

Chemical Class: Immunosuppressants, other immunosuppressants
Summary of mode of action: The mechanism of action of pirfenidone 
has not been fully established. However, existing data suggest that 
pirfenidone exerts both antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in 
a variety of in vitro systems and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis 
(bleomycin and transplant-induced fibrosis). Idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis is a chronic fibrotic and inflammatory pulmonary disease 
affected by the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
including TNF- and IL-1 and pirfenidone has been shown to reduce 
the accumulation of inflammatory cells in response to various stimuli.
Pirfenidone attenuates fibroblast proliferation, production of 
fibrosis-associated proteins and cytokines, and the increased 
biosynthesis and accumulation of extracellular matrix in response to 
cytokine growth factors such as, TGF- and PDGF.

TARGET POPULATION(S)
SI.1
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
Incidence and Prevalence
The prevalence and incidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) varies across 
studies, depending on the case definition and the population studied.  The annual 
incidence of IPF has been estimated as 6.817.4 per 100,000 in the United States and 
0.227.4 per 100,000 in the European Union (E.U.). Prevalence estimates range from 
14.063.0 per 100,000 in the United States and from 1.2523.4 per 100,000 in the E.U.
(Raghu et al. 2006; Fernández Pérez et al. 2010; Nalysnyk et al. 2012). 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is most prevalent in middle-aged and elderly patients, and 
most studies have found a higher frequency in men than in women 
(Nalysnyk et al. 2012).  Symptoms have usually been present for at least 6 months 
before the diagnosis was made.
A systematic review of 34 studies (Hutchinson et al. 2015) provides data from
21 countries.  This review shows an increasing trend in worldwide incidence rates over 
time and also that rates are converging across countries.  In studies since 2000, the 
estimated incidence rate of IPF ranges from 3–9 cases per 100,000 per year for Europe 
and North America, and is lower in East Asia and South America.
For Europe, results from large database studies in Denmark and the United Kingdom 
indicate that incidence rates of IPF range from 5.288.65 per 100,000 per year 
(age-adjusted estimates range from 2.914.17 per 100,000 per year).  Hutchinson and 
Gribbin have reported an IPF incidence rate of 4.6 per 100,000 person-years in the 
United Kingdom and have suggested that more than 4000 new cases of IPF are 
diagnosed each year in the United Kingdom (Gribbin et al. 2006; 
Hutchinson et al. 2015).  Results of regional studies across Europe provide lower rates.
While the criteria for the diagnosis of IPF have been updated (American Thoracic 
Society [ATS]/European Respiratory Society [ERS]/Japanese Respiratory Society 
[JRS]/Latin American Thoracic Association [ALAT] 2011; Raghu et al. 2018), they 
remain generally consistent with the 2000 ATS/ERS Consensus Statement 
(ATS/ERS 2000) and do not meaningfully affect prevalence estimates.  
The Orphanet Report of May 2014 cites the prevalence of IPF in Europe as 11.5 cases 
in 100,000 persons.
Demographics
According to the ATS/ERS Consensus Classification of the Idiopathic Interstitial 
Pneumonias, IPF occurs in adults and predominately in patients  50 years of age.  
Two-thirds of patients with IPF are over the age of 60 years at the time of presentation 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 12.1 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
pirfenidone
12
of
107
and the mean age at diagnosis is 66 years.  The incidence of the disease increases with 
older age (ATS/ERS 2000).
In general, the incidence of IPF is slightly higher in the male population than in females 
(Coultas et al. 1994; Thomeer et al. 2001; Gribbin et al. 2006).  In a population-based 
study of adult patients with IPF in Olmsted County, Minnesota (19972005), the age and 
sex-adjusted incidence rate was 8.8 per 100,000 (narrow criteria) and 17.4 per 
100,000 (broad criteria) person-years.  The age-adjusted incidence rate was higher in 
men than in women, and among patients aged 7079 years 
(Fernández Pérez et al. 2010).
The Main Existing Treatment Options
Pirfenidone and nintedanib are the only two approved treatment options for IPF. 
Pirfenidone was the first treatment that gained approval for IPF in the E.U. in 2011, with 
nintedanib, subsequently approved in 2014.
The 2011 ATS/ERS guidelines (which predated the E.U. approval of pirfenidone) 
recommend oxygen supplementation as required and pulmonary rehabilitation 
(ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2011).  According to the guideline pharmacological therapy, if 
elected, should be based on individualized discussions with patients.  Although lung 
transplantation may be an additional therapeutic option, patients with IPF are often 
ineligible for transplantation.
An update to the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines, published in April 2015, acknowledges 
the significant advances made in the clinical management of IPF.  New evidence for 
treatment recommendations was reviewed, and updated conditional treatment 
recommendations were provided in favor of the use of either pirfenidone or nintedanib.  
Strong recommendations were made against the use of other commonly prescribed 
therapies, including corticosteroid monotherapy, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy, and 
combined corticosteroid (e.g., azathioprine or cyclophosphamide) therapy 
(Raghu et al. 2015).  Many national IPF guidelines and position statements have been 
issued in 2017 based on the international guidelines.  The published guidelines by 
German, Spanish, French, Nordic countries, Swiss and Australian expert groups also 
positively recommend the use of pirfenidone and nintedanib in the clinical management 
of IPF (Behr et al. 2017; Cottin et al. 2017; Funke-Chambour et al. 2017; Jo et al. 2017; 
Sköld et al. 2017; Xaubet et al. 2017).  In 2018, the guideline updated the diagnostic 
criteria for IPF (Raghu et al. 2018).  Previously defined patterns of usual interstitial 
pneumonia (UIP) were redefined to patterns of UIP, probable UIP, indeterminate for UIP, 
and alternate diagnosis.
Risk Factors for the Disease
A variety of genetic and environmental risk factors have been implicated as potential 
causes of IPF, including smoking and exposure to metal and wood dust, but no definitive

107
causes have been established as the initiating factor for the development of this disease 
(ATS/ERS 2000).
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the (Untreated) Population
Disease Classification
Formal classification of IPF severity does not currently exist.  In 2011, the first 
evidence-based clinical guidelines were established to help clinicians diagnose and 
manage IPF (Raghu et al. 2011). Despite updates to the therapeutic and diagnostic 
guidelines for IPF (Raghu et al. 2015; 2018), there continues to be no formal guidance 
on disease staging.  Likely, a major factor in the lack of definitive staging criteria is the 
fact that IPF progression is not always linear and patients may have long periods of 
stable disease followed by rapid decline.
Despite this, it is generally accepted that forced vital capacity (FVC) and decrease in 
carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLco) are significant predictors of mortality in IPF.  
In contrast, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) pattern of UIP 
(probable vs. definite) is not (Yamauchi et al. 2016; Raghu et al. 2017; 
Hyldgaard et al. 2020).  One proposed staging method, GAP (gender, age, physiology) 
staging (Ley et al. 2012), incorporates the use of FVC and DLco, in addition to gender 
and age, into its prediction of mortality risk.  Gender, age, physiology Stage 1 reflects the 
lowest risk of 1 and 3-year mortality, whereas Stage III is the highest risk. However, the 
GAP staging fails to predict functional changes over the next year (Ley et al. 2016).
The official classification of disease severity in Japan uses the J system, has been 
discussed recently, and has been evaluated against a revised J system as well as the 
GAP system (Kondoh et al. 2017).  The revised J system and GAP system have been 
found to be valuable tools to predict mortality and manage IPF.  However, the J system 
has not been used in any pivotal trials for IPF elsewhere and is only used in clinical 
practice in Japan.
While there is no standardized definition for mild, moderate and severe disease, clinical 
studies have used an FVC threshold of 50%–55% predicted and a DLco threshold of 
35%–40% predicted to separate mild-to-moderate patients from those with severe 
disease (King et al. 2011; Noble et al. 2011; Richeldi et al. 2011; Raghu et al. 2012). 
Due to its relentlessly progressive nature and poor prognosis, the term 
“mild-to-moderate” IPF potentially misrepresents the seriousness of IPF, as it only refers 
to the functional status of a patient at the moment of evaluation (e.g., FVC or DLco 
values), but any patient with even very limited functional impairment (“mild” IPF) at 
diagnosis will progress to worse functional impairment and ultimately respiratory failure 
and death.

Mortality and Morbidity
The classic clinical phenotype of IPF is one of slowly progressive decline in lung function 
and worsening dyspnea, leading to death within 25 years of diagnosis 
(Bjoraker et al. 1998; Ley et al. 2011; Navaratnam et al. 2011; Strand et al. 2014).  
Historical estimates suggest that 38%55% of patients with IPF die of IPF-related 
causes (Turner-Warwick et al. 1980; Johnston et al. 1990).  However, in a Phase III trial 
of interferon gamma-1b (IFN-1b) (Actimmune), 89% of deaths in placebo patients were 
considered by the study’s principal investigators to be related to IPF 
(Martinez et al. 2005).
In IPF, hospital admissions are often due to respiratory worsening and are associated 
with reduced survival.  At least half of hospitalizations are thought to be due to acute 
exacerbations of IPF, defined as respiratory worsening over less than 1 month without 
an identifiable secondary cause, such as infection.  Based mostly on retrospective 
studies, the annual incidence rate of acute exacerbations of IPF ranges from 
approximately 5%–20%, with a mortality rate of 20%–100% (Ley and Collard 2013).
Outcome of the (Untreated) Target Disease
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a rapidly progressive disease with an extremely poor 
prognosis.  Median survival following diagnosis has been reported to be as low as 
25 years (Cottin 2012).  The clinical course is challenging to predict.  For some patients 
the course of disease is rapid, with fatal respiratory failure evolving over a few months 
(Selman et al. 2007).  Other patients have a gradual progression over years, followed by 
acute exacerbations associated with abrupt and often fatal hypoxemic respiratory failure 
(Collard et al. 2007).  Spontaneous remissions do not occur with IPF, and 10-year 
survival is less than 15% (Lynch and Belperio 2012).  Clinically, IPF usually presents 
insidiously, with the gradual onset of a non-productive cough and dyspnea.  Dyspnea is 
usually the most prominent and disabling symptom and is progressive in nature 
(ATS/ERS 2000).
Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a disease of the elderly, and two-thirds of patients with 
IPF are older than 60 years at the time of presentation (ATS/ERS 2000).
Therefore, pregnancy is a rare occurrence in the IPF population and no reliable data are 
available concerning the use of pirfenidone in pregnant women (see Section SII).
Important Co-Morbidities
The most common IPF comorbidities are coronary artery disease, gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (GERD), obstructive sleep apnea, lung cancer and pulmonary infection.

Steroid-related complications resulting from concomitant use with pirfenidone, include 
hypertension, peptic ulcer, osteoporosis, tuberculosis, and diabetes 
(Turner-Warwick et al. 1980).  Complications of other pharmacological therapies used in 
the treatment of IPF (off-label agents such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide) 
include bone marrow depression, increased susceptibility to infections, increased risk for 
malignancies, gastrointestinal (GI) distress (e.g., nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and/or 
diarrhea), and liver toxicity (with azathioprine) (Winterbauer et al. 1978; 
Raghu et al. 1991; Zisman et al. 2000).
Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a potential risk factor for IPF. Present IPF treatment 
guidelines give a conditional recommendation for anti-acid therapies (AAT) with very low 
confidence in estimates of effect (Raghu et al. 2015).
Present IPF guidelines suggest that clinicians should not use NAC monotherapy in 
patients with IPF (conditional recommendation, low confidence in estimates of effect).
After pooling the results of 3 randomized, controlled trials, no significant benefit on 
mortality was seen using NAC monotherapy for patients with IPF.  There were no 
significant differences in FVC change, quality of life or adverse outcomes 
(Raghu et al. 2015).

SPECIFICATION
TOXICITY
Repeat-Dose Toxicity
Gastrointestinal System
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs, vomiting was commonly seen at high doses of 
pirfenidone.
Central Nervous System
In repeat-dose oral studies in rats (gavage) and dogs, the principal clinical findings were 
transient CNS-related clinical effects.
Platelet Effects
Increased platelet levels were seen in some repeat-dose toxicity studies in the mouse, 
rat and dog.
Hepatic System
Increased alkaline phosphatase (up to 3-fold higher than control values), hepatic 
enzyme induction (determined in 2 studies), increased liver weight (up to 4-fold higher 
than control values) and hepatocellular hypertrophy were observed in repeat-dose dog 
toxicity studies conducted with pirfenidone.

Relevance to Human Usage
No, for platelet effects and hepatic system.
Yes, for GI system and CNS.
Discussion
Gastrointestinal effects are a recognized adverse reaction associated with clinical use of 
pirfenidone and are adequately addressed by clinical monitoring.
Central nervous system adverse reactions such as dizziness, fatigue, anorexia, and 
decreased appetite are recognized after pirfenidone administration.  Anorexia and 
decreased appetite might contribute to weight loss, which is an identified risk of 
pirfenidone administration.  It is considered that potential CNS effects of pirfenidone are 
adequately addressed by clinical monitoring.
The nonclinical hepatic findings (increased alkaline phosphatase, increased liver weight 
and hepatocellular hypertrophy) in repeat-dose dog studies are considered to be an 
adaptive response to hepatic metabolism of pirfenidone and induction of CYP enzymes.  
These findings are not considered relevant for human usage.
The increases in platelet count in these studies were considered slight in magnitude, 
were not seen in all studies, and were not considered to be toxicologically meaningful.  
Review of safety data from marketing authorization holder (MAH)-sponsored Phase III 
studies revealed no clinically-significant effects on platelets.  While a review of data from 
Shionogi reveals that there were few incidents of decreased platelet counts in their 
post-marketing surveillance program, analysis of the MAH post-marketing data for 
patients exposed to pirfenidone indicated that increases in platelet counts were not 
evident after over 63,000 world-wide patient years of exposure (PYE).  This potential risk 
was removed from the E.U. RMP in 2016.
Reproductive/Developmental Toxicity
Dietary Fertility Study
In the dietary fertility study in rats, body weight and food consumption were decreased in 
both sexes; in females, these correlated with depressed gravid uterine weights, and 
fetuses with reduced body weights and fetal immaturity (soft tissue and skeletal 
variations).  Similar changes were not observed in the fertility study in rats with gavage 
administration, which used similar dose levels.
At high doses ( 450 mg/kg/day), rats exhibited a prolongation of estrous cycle and a 
high incidence of irregular cycles.

Pre- and Post-Natal Study
In the pre- and post-natal study conducted in rats, a prolongation of gestation and 
reduction in fetal viability were observed at the high dose of 1000 mg/kg/day.  Except for 
reduced body weights during the nursing period at doses  300 mg/kg/day, there were 
no adverse effects on the postnatal development of offspring.
Relevance to Human Usage
Not known.
Discussion
The reduced fetal weights were attributed to maternal toxicity (in the absence of effects 
on the number of implantations and pre- and post-implantation losses) rather than any 
direct effect on the fetus.  The observed fetal variations were considered to result from 
secondary maternal effects (nutritional stress) which resulted in slightly delayed fetal 
development.  The relevance of the findings in the dietary study in rats to humans is not 
known at this time.
The relevance of findings (from high dose study) in rats to the menstrual cycle in 
humans is not known at this time.  This finding is included in Section 5.3 
(Preclinical Safety Data) of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).
The prolongation of the gestation period at the high dose (1000 mg/kg/day) in rats 
suggests that difficulties in parturition may have been experienced by the dams, 
resulting in adverse effects on pups with consequent loss of live pups.  The relevance of 
these findings in rats to humans is not known at this time.  These are included in 
Sections 4.6 (Fertility, Pregnancy, and Lactation) and 5.3 (Preclinical Safety Data) of the

Pirfenidone was not photomutagenic in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay but 
was photoclastogenic when exposed to ultra violet (UV) A (UVA) in the Chinese hamster 
lung cell assay.
Relevance to Human Usage
Yes
Discussion
Skin reactions and rash have been identified in clinical trials as risks for pirfenidone. 
No increase in skin cancer was observed in patients treated with pirfenidone as 
compared with placebo in the Phase III studies.  Additionally, there has been no 
indication of a safety signal related to skin cancer in either of the safety studies 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 12.1 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd

107
(PIPF-002 and PIPF-012) or in the post-marketing experience with pirfenidone in Japan.  
The incidence of cancerous and precancerous skin lesions remains low during extended 
periods of treatment with pirfenidone.  There is no evidence of a relationship between 
preexisting neoplastic or precancerous skin lesions and the subsequent occurrence of 
skin-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) due to treatment with 
pirfenidone.
Neoplastic sequelae are not considered to present a potential risk to patients.  
The potential photogenotoxicity effects of pirfenidone are; therefore, adequately 
addressed by clinical monitoring.  The positive photoclastogenic finding has been 
included in Section 5.3 (Preclinical Safety Data) of the SmPC.
Phototoxicity
There was no evidence of photosensitivity with pirfenidone but transient phototoxic 
effects were noted in the skin of guinea pigs after oral administration of pirfenidone 
concomitant to exposure to UVA/UV B (UVB).  These skin effects were mitigated with 
topical application of sunscreen agents.  In hairless mice treated orally with pirfenidone 
and exposed to UV, reversible mild acanthosis and mild single cell necrosis were 
observed in the epidermis of the auricle and the dorsal skin.  There was no systemic 
toxicity.
Relevance to Human Usage
Yes
Discussion
Photosensitivity reactions are an identified risk with pirfenidone use in humans
(see Section SVII.3.1).  This risk can be minimized by educating patients on how to 
avoid exposure to sunlight and all other sources of UV light and use appropriate sun 
blocks. Dose modification may also help to mitigate the risk.  Patients with mild or 
moderate symptoms in whom the dose has been modified can be rechallenged with full 
dose pirfenidone.  Therefore, it is considered that potential phototoxicity effects of 
pirfenidone are adequately addressed by clinical monitoring.
Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats revealed an increase in the incidence of liver 
cell tumors in both species and an increase in uterine tumors in rats.  These increased 
tumors are attributed to rodent and rat specific mode of actions, respectively.

of
107
Discussion
The uterine tumors observed in rats are a well-documented, species-specific finding due 
to prolactin level reduction and a shift in the estrogen/progesterone ratio, with no 
correlation in humans.  Similarly, hepatocellular tumors observed in rodent studies of 
pirfenidone were described as secondary to phenobarbital-type induction of drug 
metabolizing, CYP450 enzymes in the liver.  Although evaluation of epidemiologic 
studies of several marketed drug products with these animal findings suggests no 
indication of an increased risk in development of either tumor type in humans, the 
relevance of these rodent tumors to humans is not known at this time.
GENERAL SAFETY PHARMACOLOGY
Gastrointestinal System
In nonclinical safety pharmacology studies, decreased gastric emptying and decreased 
small intestinal transport were observed in rats after oral administration of pirfenidone.
Relevance to Human Usage
Yes
Discussion
Gastrointestinal effects (diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, GERD, and abdominal 
discomfort) are a recognized adverse reaction associated with clinical use of pirfenidone.  
These symptoms can be reduced by taking pirfenidone with food.
If symptoms persist, a 
dose reduction regime can be applied. Therefore, it is considered that potential 
GI effects of pirfenidone in humans are adequately addressed by clinical monitoring.
Cardiovascular System
In two cardiovascular safety studies in rats, intraduodenal administration of pirfenidone
at high doses (300 mg/kg) did evoke occasional arrhythmias; however, these were 
episodic in nature and were not observed in any dog study.
Relevance to Human Usage
No
Discussion
The clinical relevance of the findings in rats is uncertain with respect to both the route of 
administration utilized and the fact that the mechanisms of cardiac repolarization are 
different in rats compared to dogs and humans.  The arrhythmias observed in rat safety 
pharmacology studies are considered to have no relevance to human usage. Review of 
safety data from the Phase III studies, including central review of ECGs, along with 
post-marketing safety data from Japan, post-marketing safety data covering over 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 12.1 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
pirfenidone
20
of
107
63,000 PYE of world-wide exposure, and a long-term prospective study following 
patients exposed to pirfenidone under real-world conditions have shown no clear sign of 
cardiac toxicity.
Central Nervous System
Pirfenidone has been shown to interact with the dopamine transporter with in vitro IC50/Ki 
values of 988/785 M pirfenidone (183/145 g/mL).  The clinical steady state maximum 
observed concentration (Cmax) is 14.7 g/mL after a single oral dose of 2403 mg/day. 
In safety pharmacology studies, transient neurobehavioral effects, including sedation, 
abnormal posture, abnormal limb position, staggering gait, ptosis, and hypothermia were 
seen in mice administered single oral doses of pirfenidone.  At a 300 mg/kg oral dose, 
pirfenidone caused a prolongation of pentobarbital-induced sleep time.
Relevance to Human Usage
Yes
Discussion
Central nervous system adverse reactions such as dizziness, fatigue, anorexia, and 
decreased appetite are recognized after pirfenidone administration.  Anorexia and 
decreased appetite might contribute to weight loss, which is an identified risk of 
pirfenidone administration.  To minimize the risk of dizziness, patients are advised to 
take pirfenidone with food.  Patients are instructed to learn how they react to pirfenidone 
before they drive a vehicle or operate machinery.  To minimize the risk of weight loss 
associated with anorexia and decreased appetite, health care professionals and patients 
will be advised to monitor the patient’s weight and to use dietary supplementation where 
necessary.  Therefore, it is considered that potential CNS effects of pirfenidone are 
adequately addressed by clinical monitoring.
Pregnancy and Lactation
In lactating animals, excretion of pirfenidone and/ or its metabolites in milk occurs with 
the potential for the accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in milk.
In pregnant animals, placental transfer of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites occurs with 
the potential for the accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in amniotic fluid.
Relevance to Human Usage
Not known
Discussion
The relevance of these findings in rats to humans is not known at this time.

SV.1 POST-AUTHORISATION EXPOSURE
SV.1.1 Method Used to Calculate Exposure
The methodology used for patient exposure calculation was as below:


Patient equivalent: Total Volume / (Dose/day/patient x Compliance  Persistence 
365 days)
Patient Year: Total Pills / (7.2 pills Persistence 365 days)
Persistence refers to the percentage of time a patient stays on treatment in a
12 month period.

Patient Year: Total Volume / (Dose/day/patient  Compliance  365 days)
Data from commercial sales and Named Patient Programs (NPPs) have been used to 
calculate the cumulative patient exposure to Esbriet from marketing experience.
The volume sold by Roche is sourced from Roche supply chain and financial systems 
(Controlling Profitability Analysis).  The sales data are provided on a monthly basis; 
therefore, the exposure is available from the International Birth Date 
(IBD, 28 February 2011) to the nearest point data lock point (DLP, i.e., 27 February 2022
[Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report RDR 1113548]).

The cumulative exposure was estimated by adding the results of the interval
exposure since IBD per Roche estimation methodology (see above)
The source for the persistence data is the Roche IPF market tracker.  The IPF market 
tracker is a Roche commissioned primary market research project conducted in 
5 E.U. Countries (Germany, Spain, France, Italy and U.K.).
SV.1.2 Exposure
As of February 2022, the estimated cumulative total exposure to Esbriet from marketing 
experience is 306,149 patient-equivalent and 208,790 patient-years (see Table 12 and 
Table 13, respectively).

PART II: MODULE SVI  ADDITIONAL E.U. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION
POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES
The MAH is not aware of any evidence to suggest a potential for misuse or abuse and 
so this risk is thought to be very low.

SUBMISSION
SVII.1.1 Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety 
Concerns in the RMP
Not applicable.
SVII.1.2 Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety 
Concerns in the RMP
Not applicable.
SVII.2 NEW SAFETY CONCERNS AND RECLASSIFICATION WITH A 
SUBMISSION OF AN UPDATED RMP
Severe skin reactions, previously classified as an important potential risk, is no longer 
included in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis have been included in Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 of the SmPC, 
based on the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) Periodic Safety 
Update Report (PSUR) Assessment Report (procedure number 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00002435/202102). The risk of severe skin reactions will be subject 
to routine pharmacovigilance and risk minimization measures and no additional 
pharmacovigilance activities are deemed necessary. The risk is therefore removed from 
the RMP as an important potential risk.
As requested by the PRAC in the assessment report for procedure number 
EMEA/H/C/002154/II/0074, the following safety concerns have been removed from the 
list of safety concerns in the RMP:




Gastrointestinal symptoms, previously classified as an important identified risk
Risk of medication error in patients transferring between capsules and tablets,
previously classified as an important potential risk
Patients with QT prolongation
Patients with underlying specific cardiac events, previously classified as missing
information
None of these safety concerns  are subject to additional pharmacovigilance activities and 
no additional risk minimization measures are in place.  The SmPC describes the routine 
risk minimization measures in place for Gastrointestinal symptoms, and these 
symptoms are well recognized and well-characterized.  Following continued 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 12.1 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd

post-marketing monitoring by the MAH, no safety signal has emerged for the other 
safety concerns.  Therefore, it is considered at this stage of the product life cycle these 
safety concerns can be removed from the RMP.  The MAH will continue to monitor 
such events via routine pharmacovigilance and present an evaluation of any newly 
emerging data via the appropriate regulatory channels.
SVII.3 DETAILS OF IMPORTANT IDENTIFIED RISKS, IMPORTANT 
POTENTIAL RISKS, AND MISSING INFORMATION
SVII.3.1. Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential 
Risks
Information on Important Identified Risks
The following section is based on data presented in the ISS RSU and describes 
2 important patient subsets:


The Randomized Patient Subset: pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (623 patients) and
placebo (624 patients) in Studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006, and PIPF-016, totaling
1247 patients
The Pirfenidone Patient Original Treatment Arm Subset: patients who received at
least 1 dose of pirfenidone in Studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006, PIPF-016, as well as
open-label Studies PIPF-002 and PIPF-012 (which only contained patients originally
enrolled in Studies PIPF-004 and PIPF-006), totaling 1067 patients
(2014 RSU Table 1.1-1U).  This represents a subset of the overall
Pirfenidone Patient Subset described in Part II, Module SIII (N  1299).
Photosensitivity Reaction and Rash
MedDRA terms: Photosensitivity reaction, rash
Potential mechanism: Cutaneous photosensitivity is due to UV ray exposure after 
administration of this drug.
administration or reducing the dose.
It is transient and is alleviated by discontinuing 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: A series of 4 nonclinical studies have been 
conducted to evaluate the potential phototoxic effects of pirfenidone in the presence of 
UV light in guinea pigs.  Some of these studies detected erythema of the skin in guinea 
pigs as well as irritation and inflammation histologically.  However, the phototoxic effects 
on skin were mitigated by the use of sunscreens with SPF values of 50 or greater.  
In hairless mice treated with pirfenidone and exposed to UV, reversible mild acanthosis 
and mild single cell necrosis were observed in the epidermis of the auricle and the dorsal 
skin.  There was no systemic toxicity. Incidence in patients has been derived from 
clinical studies in the E.U. and U.S.

Frequency in the Randomized, Blinded Trial Population
Photosensitivity
In the Randomized Patient Subset, photosensitivity reaction was reported for 9.3% of 
pirfenidone patients and 1.1% of placebo patients.  In the pirfenidone group, 5 patients 
(0.8%) had Grade 3 events, 1 patient (0.2%) had a treatment-emergent serious adverse 
event (TESAE), and 4 patients (0.6%) discontinued treatment for a photosensitivity 
reaction; no patient had a Grade 4 event, was hospitalized, or died.  In the placebo 
group, 1 patient (0.2%) had a Grade 3 event and 1 patient (0.2%) discontinued treatment 
because of a photosensitivity reaction; no patient had a Grade 4 event, a TESAE, was 
hospitalized, or died.
Rash
In the Randomized Patient Subset, rash was reported for 30.3% of pirfenidone patients 
and 10.3% of placebo patients.  In the pirfenidone group, 4 patients (0.6%) had Grade 3 
rash, 1 patient (0.2%) had a TESAE, and 8 patients (1.3%) discontinued treatment for a 
rash; no patient had a Grade 4 event, was hospitalized, or died.  In the placebo group, 
1 patient (0.2%) had a Grade 3 event; no patient had a Grade 4 event, a TESAE, was 
hospitalized, discontinued treatment, or died because of rash.

Severity and Nature of Risk
Photosensitivity
In the Randomized Patient Subset, 5 (0.8%) of the 623 patients treated with pirfenidone 
2403 mg/day reported a Grade 3 photosensitivity reaction. One (0.2%) of the 
624 patients treated with placebo reported Grade 3 photosensitivity reaction.  Half of the 
patients in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group who reported photosensitivity reaction 
first did so between Month 0 and 3.  The majority of photosensitivity reactions in the 
Pirfenidone Patient Original Treatment Arm Subset (112/118, 95%) were Grades 1 or 2.  
Overall, no patient experienced Grade 4 photosensitivity reaction during pirfenidone 
treatment.  The risk is potentially severe due to the nature of the possible long-term 
adverse effects arising from sunburn and skin damage.
Rash
In the Randomized Patient Subset, 4 (0.6%) of the 623 patients treated with pirfenidone 
2403 mg/day reported a Grade 3 rash.  One (0.2%) of the 624 patients treated with 
placebo reported a Grade 3 rash.  In the majority of patients with rash in the 
Pirfenidone Patient Original Treatment Arm Subset (289/295, 98%), the severity was 
Grade 1 or Grade 2.  Overall, no patient experienced a Grade 4 rash during pirfenidone 
treatment.  Most patients in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group, who reported a rash 
first, did so between Month 0 and 6.
Seriousness/outcomes
In the Pirfenidone Patient Original Treatment Arm Subset, there were 381 patients 
(35.7%) with rash and/or photosensitivity reaction; these events tended to occur within 
the first 6 months of treatment (276/381, 72%).
Impact on Quality of Life
Patients treated with pirfenidone who experience a photosensitivity reaction may require 
treatment with topical corticosteroids and may need to reduce the dose or stop 
pirfenidone.  Patients taking pirfenidone should take measures to avoid or protect 
against (sun blocks, clothing) sun exposure.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups
No specific groups or factors indicating increased risk of photosensitivity reaction or rash 
have been identified for either patients with IPF or those treated with pirfenidone.

Photosensitivity
In the Randomized Patient Subset, approximately 9 times the percentage of patients 
treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day compared with placebo reported a photosensitivity 
reaction.  Sex, age, race, and baseline IPF severity did not appear to have an effect on 
photosensitivity reaction.
Rash
In the Randomized Patient Subset, approximately 3 times the percentage of patients 
treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day compared with placebo reported a rash.  
There was a suggestion of a race effect.  In the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group, after 
subtracting the placebo effect, 12.8% more white patients than non-white patients 
reported rash; however, sex, age, and baseline IPF severity did not appear to have an 
effect.  In the general population, risk factors for photosensitivity reactions include 
prolonged exposure to the sun and UV rays; diseases such as dermatomyositis and 
lupus erythematosus; and certain drugs and drug classes (e.g., antibiotics [quinolones, 
tetracyclines, sulfonamides]), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diuretics, 
chemotherapeutics agents and retinoids.
Preventability
Direct exposure to strong UV radiation should be avoided during treatment with 
pirfenidone.  Patients should be cautioned to use sun block and appropriate protective 
clothing to minimize sun exposure.
In Section 4.4 of the SmPC, special warnings and precautions for use of Esbriet have 
been stated to avoid photosensitivity reaction and rash.  It is advised that exposure to 
direct sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided or minimized during treatment 
with Esbriet.  Patients should be instructed to use a sunblock daily, to wear clothing that 
protects against sun exposure, and to avoid other medications known to cause 
photosensitivity.
A statement has also been included in Section 4.2 of the SmPC that dose adjustment or 
temporary treatment discontinuation may be necessary in patients who experience a 
mild to severe photosensitivity reaction or rash.
A Safety Checklist about monitoring and management of photosensitivity reaction and 
rash was made available via distribution at the time of each formulation launch to all 
local medical staff involved in managing patients with IPF.  It requests reporting of all 
clinically-significant adverse drug reactions (ADR) of photosensitivity reaction and rash 
to the MAH where an association is suspected.  Given that the incidence of 
photosensitivity reaction is increased in early summer, particular attention should be paid 
to preventive measures during those months.

Impact on the Benefit-Risk Balance of the Product
The impact of photosensitivity reaction and rash on the benefit-risk balance of 
pirfenidone is considered low since the adverse events (AEs) are typically non-serious, 
transient, and manageable per the label.  The risk minimization activities consisting of 
educational material/label, mitigate both risk severity and early discontinuation of 
pirfenidone.  In consideration of the benefit conferred by the drug, and the ability to 
manage the risk, the impact on the benefit-risk balance is low.
Public Health Impact
The potential public health impact of photosensitivity reaction and rash is low based on 
the typically non-serious, transient, and manageable nature of these AEs.
Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
MedDRA terms: Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ) drug-related hepatic disorders 
severe events only (narrow) and related sub-SMQs.
Potential mechanism:  Unknown
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  Incidence in patients has been derived 
from clinical studies in the E.U. and U.S. and estimates of post-marketing patient 
exposure
Characterization of the Risk
Incidence/prevalence
Drug-induced liver injury has an estimated annual incidence between 10 and 15 per 
10,000 to 100,000 persons exposed to prescription medications. The prevalence and 
cause of DILI varies geographically (Hassan and Fontana 2018).  Drug-induced liver 
injury accounts for approximately 10% of all cases of acute hepatitis
(Zimmerman 2000), is the cause of acute jaundice in 50% of patients who present with 
new jaundice, and accounts for up to half of the cases of acute liver failure in Western 
countries (Larrey 2002; Ostapowicz et al. 2002; Sgro et al. 2002; Larson et al. 2005; 
Hussaini et al. 2007; Wei et al. 2007; Reuben et al. 2010).
There were no reports of DILI during the pivotal clinical trials.  Thus, its frequency has 
been estimated based on the guidance provided with “A Guideline on Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC), Revision 2” released by the European Commission in 
September 2009. Considering that 623 patients have been enrolled in Esbriet pivotal 
trials and that the upper limit of the 95% CI is not higher than 3/623, then the upper limit 
of the 95% CI for the point estimate is 1/207 or less and the resulting frequency category 
is "uncommon", based on the worst value of the point estimate.

Clinically silent liver enzyme abnormalities have been detected during clinical 
development, and are well-described in the E.U. SmPC (Section 4.4).  In the pooled 
pivotal Studies PIPF-004, -006 and -016, the placebo group included 9/624 (1.4%) 
patients with reported ALT increase and 9/624 (1.4%) patients with reported AST 
increase (Section 2.2 and Table 7 of Drug Safety Report [DSR] 1097072).

Source: Adapted from t_risks_95_ core_id.rtf Important Identified Risks.
Severity and Nature of Risk
A cumulative assessment of all the available evidence concerning severe hepatotoxicity 
in patients treated with pirfenidone was performed in 2019 (DLP: 30 June 2019; 
DSR 1097072). This included the review of nonclinical, clinical studies, literature data 
and post-marketing reports, plus a retrospective cohort study of a claim database 
(PharmMetrics™).  No evidence of liver damage following exposure to pirfenidone was 
found during the review of toxicology studies data. The review of clinical trial data 
showed an increased cumulative incidence of hepatic TEAEs with pirfenidone versus the 
control arm (placebo). The majority of these TEAEs (9.5% pirfenidone vs. 4.3% 
placebo) were laboratory abnormalities without clinical consequences (RSU 2014).
Cumulatively, as of the DLP date of the DSR (i.e., 30 June 2019), 383 cases reporting 
418 events were retrieved from the Roche global safety database using MedDRA SMQ 
drug-related hepatic disorders  severe events only (narrow) and related sub SMQs.  
In line with the known epidemiology of IPF, the majority of these cases were reported in 
elderly patients (62.4%) and included manifestation of DILI such as liver disorders, liver 
injury, hepatotoxicity, hepatocellular injury, and liver failure.  In 24 of the 383 cases 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 12.1 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
pirfenidone
49
of
107
(6.2%), the reported event led to a fatal outcome.  Reports providing sufficient 
information were assessed for causality via the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment 
Method (RUCAM) score, an algorithm widely used to assess the causal relationship 
between medicines and DILI; this was possible in 22 of the 383 cases (5.7%).  Two of 
these 22 cases (9.1%) recently published in the literature (Verma et al. 2017; 
Benesic et al. 2019) had a RUCAM score of 68 indicating a highly probable causal 
association with the use of pirfenidone, whereas 3 cases (13.6%) had a RUCAM score 
of 35 implying a probable causal association.  The remaining 361 cases (94.3%) where 
a RUCAM score could not be assessed were reviewed based on the available evidence 
and categorized as probable causal relationship (1, 0.3%), questionable causal 
relationship due to alternative and more likely etiologies (113, 31.3%) and cases 
presenting with insufficient information (247, 68.4%).
Based on the above evidence, it is justified to conclude that pirfenidone is causally 
associated with clinical manifestations of DILI, including rare cases with fatal outcome, 
possibly caused by idiosyncratic reactions to pirfenidone.  Subsequently, DILI was 
added as important identified risk to the E.U. RMP.
Impact on Quality of Life
Drug-induced liver injury can develop following the use of many prescriptions and 
over-the-counter drugs through a variety of mechanisms, and can resemble almost all 
known types of acute, subacute, and chronic liver disease (Chalasani et al. 2014). 
Therefore, the impact on quality of life varies greatly, ranging from negligible in case of 
clinically silent laboratory abnormalities to severe in case of serious manifestations such 
as acute liver failure.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups
Subgroup analyses of specific liver-related laboratory outcomes by sex, age and 
baseline IPF severity was not possible as there were too few patients in these 
subgroups to draw meaningful conclusions.  Risk groups or risk factors are dependent 
on the nature of the liver disorder although non-specific factors for all forms of hepatic 
dysfunction such as alcohol abuse are well-recognized.
Preventability
Esbriet (pirfenidone) should be used with caution in patients with preexisting mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment.  Esbriet should not be used in patients with severe or end 
stage liver disease.  Because pirfenidone is metabolized by the liver, dosing of 
pirfenidone and/or other drugs metabolized in the liver may require adjustment upon 
starting or stopping concomitant therapy.

In the setting of regular LFT monitoring and a dose-modification plan in the Phase III 
clinical studies, hepatotoxicity occurred infrequently, was manageable, and was 
reversible.  Most patients normalized or improved their laboratory abnormalities over 
time, generally without permanent dose modifications.  Rarely have these elevations 
been associated with concomitant elevations in bilirubin.  However, clinical 
manifestations of DILI including cases with fatal outcome  possibly caused by 
idiosyncratic reactions to pirfenidone – have been reported post-marketing in rare 
instances (DSR 1097072).
The SmPC Section 4.4 (Special Warnings and Precautions), provides detailed 
recommendations to monitor LFTs prior to the initiation of the treatment and 
subsequently at monthly intervals for the first 6 months and then every 3 months 
thereafter.  In addition, LFTs should be promptly measured in patients who report 
symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper 
abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice.  It has also been recommended that in 
case of ALT and/or AST elevations  3 to 5  upper limit of normal (ULN) without 
bilirubin elevation after starting pirfenidone therapy, other causes should be excluded, 
and the patient monitored closely.  Discontinuation of other medicines associated with 
liver toxicity should be considered.  If clinically appropriate, the dose of pirfenidone 
should be reduced or interrupted (e.g., until LFTs are within normal limits) with 
subsequent re-escalation to the recommended daily dose if tolerated.  Pirfenidone 
should be discontinued and the patient should not be rechallenged if a patient exhibits 
an AST and/or ALT elevation 3 to  5 ULN accompanied by hyperbilirubinemia or 
clinical signs or symptoms indicative of liver injury, or if a patient exhibits an 
aminotransferase elevation to  5 ULN.
In Section 4.3 of the SmPC, the use of pirfenidone is contraindicated in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment or end stage liver disease.
Potential risk factors for hepatic dysfunction, in general, are known and awareness of 
these, coupled with advice in the SmPC that pirfenidone should be used with caution in 
patients with preexisting mild to moderate hepatic impairment will help minimize the risk 
from increased exposure to pirfenidone.  A Safety Checklist about monitoring and 
management of hepatic-related events, including asymptomatic abnormal levels of ALT/
AST was made available to be distributed at the time of launch to all local medical staff 
involved in managing patients with IPF.  It requests reporting of all 
clinically-significant ADRs of liver-related abnormalities to the MAH.
Impact on the Benefit-Risk Balance of the Product
The impact of DILI is considered low in most of the cases, characterized by 
asymptomatic incidental lab findings, and manageable per the label.  There were no 
reports of DILI during the pivotal clinical trials and approximately half of the reports 
received post-marketing recovered without sequelae.  The risk minimization activities

consisting of educational material/label, including recommendation of baseline and 
periodic laboratory tests, enables early identification and mitigation of the risk.
In consideration of the benefit conferred by the drug, the rarity of DILI reports, and the 
ability to manage the risk by monitoring LFTs and reducing or discontinuing treatment in 
case of abnormal values, the overall impact on the benefit-risk balance is deemed 
acceptable.
Public Health Impact
The potential public health impact of DILI is deemed acceptable in consideration of the 
benefit conferred by the drug, the rarity of DILI and the ability to manage the risk by 
monitoring LFTs and reducing or discontinuing treatment in case of abnormal values.

Reporting of any findings to regulatory authorities is done as required, based on the 
nature and strength of the evidence and its impact on benefit risk assessment.
Although pregnancy is a rare occurrence in this elderly patient population, any 
pregnancy reports will be followed up via the Roche standard pregnancy follow-up 
process.  This was implemented for all products to request additional information on the 
medication history of the exposed parent, relevant medical history for the mother and 
father, previous obstetric history, the current pregnancy, fetal and infant conditions, and 
results of tests and investigations for any pregnancy complication or congenital 
abnormality during pregnancy or within the first year of the infant’s life.

Routine Risk Minimization Activities
Routine risk minimization activities recommending specific clinical 
measures to address the risk:
Exposure to direct sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided or 
minimized during treatment with pirfenidone. 
Patients who experience a mild to moderate photosensitivity reaction or 
rash should be reminded to use a sunblock daily and to avoid exposure to 
the sun, to wear clothing that protects against sun exposure, and to avoid 
other medicinal products known to cause photosensitivity. 
Patients should be instructed to report symptoms of photosensitivity 
reaction or rash to their physician.  
Patients who experience severe photosensitivity reaction or rash should 
be instructed to interrupt the dose and to seek medical advice 
(see Section 4.4).  Once the rash has resolved, pirfenidone may be 
re-introduced and re-escalated up to the recommended daily dose at the 
discretion of the physician. Severe photosensitivity reactions are 
uncommon.  
Dose adjustments or temporary treatment discontinuation may be 
necessary in mild to severe cases of photosensitivity reaction or rash 
(see Section 4.2).  This has been adequately captured in Section 4.4 of 
E.U. SmPC.

Elevated transaminases have been commonly reported in patients treated 
with pirfenidone. Liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) should be 
performed prior to the initiation of treatment with pirfenidone, and 
subsequently at monthly intervals for the first 6 months and then 
every 3 months thereafter (see Section 4.8 of the Esbriet SmPC).
Safety Concern
Routine Risk Minimization Activities
If a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation  3 to  5  ULN 
without bilirubin elevation and without symptoms or signs of DILI after 
starting pirfenidone therapy, other causes should be excluded, and the 
patient monitored closely. Discontinuation of other medicines associated 
with liver toxicity should be considered. If clinically appropriate, the dose 
of pirfenidone should be reduced or interrupted.  Once liver function tests 
are within normal limits pirfenidone may be re-escalated to the 
recommended daily dose if tolerated. 
DILI
Uncommonly, elevations in AST and ALT were associated with 
concomitant bilirubin increases.  Cases of severe DILI, including isolated 
cases with fatal outcome, have been reported post-marketing 
(see Section 4.8 of the Esbriet SmPC).
In addition to the recommended regular monitoring of liver function tests, 
prompt clinical evaluation and measurement of liver function tests should 
be performed in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver 
injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark 
urine, or jaundice.
If a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation  3 to  5  ULN 
accompanied by hyperbilirubinaemia or clinical signs or symptoms 
indicative of liver injury, pirfenidone should be permanently discontinued 
and the patient should not be rechallenged.
If a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation to  5  ULN, 
pirfenidone should be permanently discontinued and the patient should 
not be rechallenged.
Hepatic impairment
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (i.e., Child-Pugh Class B), 
pirfenidone exposure was increased by 60%.  Pirfenidone should be 
used with caution in patients with pre-existing mild to moderate hepatic 
impairment (i.e., Child-Pugh Class A and B) given the potential for 
increased pirfenidone exposure.  Patients should be monitored closely 
for signs of toxicity especially if they are concomitantly taking a known 
CYP1A2 inhibitor (see Sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the Esbriet SmPC). 
Pirfenidone has not been studied in individuals with severe hepatic 
impairment and Esbriet must not be used in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see Section 4.3 of the Esbriet SmPC).

Safety Checklist
To Intensify communication and medical and patient education 
around photosensitivity reaction and rash with measures to avoid 
exposure to sun and other UV sources and risk of photosensitivity 
reactions.
To prevent clinically significant ADRs of photosensitivity reaction 
and rash where an association is suspected and to better clarify 
the nature of the rash, and identify specific risk factors if the event 
manifests.
All local medical staff involved in managing patients with IPF.
How effectiveness will be measured: 
1. Monitor distribution metrics of checklist at the time of local 
tablet launch.
2. Monitor against increasing trends in worldwide and regional 
(E.U., U.S., ROW) exposure adjusted reporting rates and 
document in the PBRER.
Criteria for judging the success: 
1.
2.
If metrics of educational materials distribution at PBRER time 
are not adequate, Safety Science will work with the Local 
Safety Unit to identify reasons and address with remediation. 
If an increase trend in worldwide or regional exposure 
adjusted reporting rates is identified, a root-cause analysis 
will be conducted assessing the reports for the geography at 
issue to determine risk factors and efficacy of education.
Further reinforcement and education on the need for 
preventing/reducing exposure to UV light by the patient may be 
conducted to make prescribers and patients aware of these 
factors.  
In addition, further reinforcement might be proposed in the SmPC 
and PL if there was an aggregate signal.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR ESBRIET (PIRFENIDONE)
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Esbriet.  The RMP details 
important risks of Esbriet, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Esbriet risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Esbriet’s SmPC and its Package Leaflet give essential information to healthcare 
professionals and patients on how Esbriet should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Esbriet should be read in the context of all this information,
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Esbriet RMP.
I. THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Esbriet is authorized for the treatment of IPF.  It contains pirfenidone as the active 
substance and it is given by oral administration.
II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS
Important risks of Esbriet, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Esbriet’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the Package Leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g., with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Esbriet, these measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant risks, below.  
In addition to these measures, information about AEs is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken 
as necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

II.A LIST OF IMPORTANT RISKS AND MISSING INFORMATION
Important risks of Esbriet are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Esbriet.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT RISKS
Important Identified Risk: Photosensitivity Reaction and Rash
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Risk factors and risk 
groups
A series of 4 nonclinical studies have been conducted to evaluate 
the potential phototoxic effects of pirfenidone in the presence of UV 
light in guinea pigs. Some of these studies detected erythema of 
the skin in guinea pigs as well as irritation and inflammation 
histologically.  However, the phototoxic effects on skin were 
mitigated by the use of sunscreens with SPF values of 50 or 
greater.  In hairless mice treated with pirfenidone and exposed to 
UV, reversible mild acanthosis and mild single cell necrosis were 
observed in the epidermis of the auricle and the dorsal skin.
There was no systemic toxicity.

Incidence in patients has been 
No specific groups or factors indicating increased risk of 
photosensitivity reaction or rash have been identified for either 
patients with IPF or those treated with pirfenidone. 
Photosensitivity:  In the Updated Randomized Patient Subset, 
approximately 9 times the percentage of patients treated with 
pirfenidone 2403 mg/day compared with placebo reported a 
photosensitivity reaction.  Sex, age, race, and baseline IPF severity 
did not appear to have an effect on photosensitivity reaction.

Rash: In the Updated Randomized Patient Subset, approximately 
3 times the percentage of patients treated with pirfenidone 
2403 mg/day compared with placebo reported a rash. There was a 
suggestion of a race effect. In the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group, 
after subtracting the placebo effect, 12.8% more white patients than 
non-white patients reported rash; however, sex, age, and baseline 
IPF severity did not appear to have an effect.  In the general 
population, risk factors for photosensitivity reactions include 
prolonged exposure to the sun and UV rays; diseases such as 
dermatomyositis and lupus erythematosus; and certain drugs and 
drug classes (e.g., antibiotics [quinolones, tetracyclines, 
sulfonamides]), NSAIDs, diuretics, chemotherapeutics agents and 
retinoids.

Section 4 Possible side effects
Routine risk minimization activities recommending specific 
clinical measures to address the risk:
Exposure to direct sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided 
or minimized during treatment with Esbriet.
Patients who experience a mild to moderate photosensitivity 
reaction or rash should be reminded to use a sunblock daily and to 
avoid exposure to the sun, to wear clothing that protects against sun 
exposure, and to avoid other medicinal products known to cause 
photosensitivity. Patients should be instructed to report symptoms 
of photosensitivity reaction or rash to their physician. Patients who 
experience severe photosensitivity reaction or rash should be 
instructed to interrupt the dose and to seek medical advice (see 
Section 4.4 of the Esbriet SmPC). Once the rash has resolved, 
Esbriet may be re-introduced and re-escalated up to the 
recommended daily dose at the discretion of the physician.
Severe photosensitivity reactions are uncommon.  
Dose adjustments or temporary treatment discontinuation may be 
necessary in mild to severe cases of photosensitivity reaction or 
rash (see Section 4.2). This has been adequately captured in 
Section 4.4 of E.U. SmPC.

Subgroup analyses of specific liver-related laboratory outcomes in the 
pooled safety analyses, in relation to the effects of sex, age and 
baseline IPF severity was not possible as there were too few patients 
in these subgroups to draw meaningful conclusions.  Risk groups or 
risk factors are dependent on the nature of the liver disorder although 
non-specific factors for all forms of hepatic dysfunction such as 
alcohol abuse are well-recognized.

Important Identified Risk: DILI
Elevated transaminases have been commonly reported in patients 
treated with Esbriet. Liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) 
should be performed prior to the initiation of treatment with Esbriet, 
and subsequently at monthly intervals for the first 6 months and then 
every 3 months thereafter (see Section 4.8 of the Esbriet SmPC). 
If a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation  3 to  5  ULN 
without bilirubin elevation and without symptoms or signs DILI after 
starting Esbriet therapy, other causes should be excluded, and the 
patient monitored closely.  Discontinuation of other medicines 
associated with liver toxicity should be considered. If clinically 
appropriate, the dose of Esbriet should be reduced or interrupted. 
Once liver function tests are within normal limits Esbriet may be 
re-escalated to the recommended daily dose if tolerated. 
DILI
Uncommonly, elevations in AST and ALT were associated with 
concomitant bilirubin increases.  Cases of severe DILI, including 
isolated cases with fatal outcome, have been reported post-marketing 
(see Section 4.8 of the Esbriet SmPC).
In addition to the recommended regular monitoring of liver function 
tests, prompt clinical evaluation and measurement of liver function 
tests should be performed in patients who report symptoms that may 
indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal 
discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice.
If a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation  3 to  5  ULN 
accompanied by hyperbilirubinaemia or clinical signs or symptoms 
indicative of liver injury, Esbriet should be permanently discontinued 
and the patient should not be rechallenged.
If a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation to  5  ULN, 
Esbriet should be permanently discontinued and the patient should 
not be rechallenged.
Hepatic impairment
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (i.e., Child-Pugh Class 
B), pirfenidone exposure was increased by 60%.  Esbriet should be 
used with caution in patients with preexisting mild to moderate hepatic 
impairment (i.e., Child-Pugh Class A and B) given the potential for 
increased pirfenidone exposure.  Patients should be monitored closely 
for signs of toxicity especially if they are concomitantly taking a known 
CYP1A2 inhibitor (see Sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the Esbriet SmPC).
Esbriet has not been studied in individuals with severe hepatic 
impairment and Esbriet must not be used in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (see Section 4.3 of the Esbriet SmPC).

Post-Authorization Use in Populations Not Studied in Clinical 
Trials
Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of the elderly, and two-thirds of patients 
with IPF are older than 60 years at the time of presentation (American Thoracic 
Society/European Respiratory Society 2000).
Therefore, pregnancy is a rare occurrence in the IPF population and no reliable data are 
available concerning the use of pirfenidone in pregnant women.  Nevertheless, in 
animals, placental transfer of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites occurs with the potential 
for accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in amniotic fluid.  At high doses 
( 1000 mg/kg/day), rats exhibited prolongation of gestation and reduction in fetal 
viability.  As a precautionary measure, it is thus, preferable to avoid the use of 
pirfenidone during pregnancy.
It is unknown whether pirfenidone or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of pirfenidone and/or 
its metabolites in milk with the potential for accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its 
metabolites in milk (E.U. Summary of Product Characteristics, see Section 5.3).
Therefore, a risk to the breastfed infant cannot be excluded.


Gastrointestinal symptoms were removed as safety concern for which other forms of routine 
PV activities are in place
Overall, none of these concerns are subject to additional pharmacovigilance activities and no
additional risk minimization measures are in place.  The SmPC describes the routine risk 
minimization measures in place for Gastrointestinal symptoms, and these symptoms are 
well-recognized and well-characterized.  Following continued post-marketing monitoring by the 
MAH, no safety signal has emerged for the other safety concerns.  Therefore, it is considered that 
at this stage of the product life cycle these safety concerns can be removed from the RMP.

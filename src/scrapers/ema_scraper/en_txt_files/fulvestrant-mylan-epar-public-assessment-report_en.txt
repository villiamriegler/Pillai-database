2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The  Applicant  Mylan  S.A.S.  submitted  marketing  authorization  application  for  Fulvestrant  Mylan  250 
mg/5ml solution for injection. The application is referring to Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as 
amended.  
The proposed product Fulvestrant Mylan 250 mg/5 ml solution for injection is long – acting 
intramuscular depot formulation containing Fulvestrant as active substance. Fulvestrant is a chemical 
substance and the dosage form has been developed as generic product to the centrally authorised 
product Faslodex containing the same active substance in the same pharmaceutical form. The 
reference product Faslodex 250 mg/5 ml Solution for Injection (Faslodex) authorised in EU via the 
centralised procedure by AstraZeneca UK Limited. Date of issue of marketing authorisation valid 
throughout the European Union for Faslodex is 10th March 2004, Marketing authorisation number 
EU/1/03/269/001, EU/1/03/269/002. 
The  claimed  indications  for  this  generic  application  are  the  same  as  those  of  reference  product 
Faslodex: 
Fulvestrant is indicated for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer in postmenopausal women: 
• 
not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or 
•  with  disease  relapse  on  or  after  adjuvant  anti-estrogen  therapy,  or  disease  progression  on 
antiestrogen therapy. 
The recommended dose is 500 mg at intervals of one month, with an additional 500 mg dose given 
two weeks after the initial dose. 
Fulvestrant  Mylan  should  be  administered  as  two  consecutive  5  ml  injections  by  slow  intramuscular 
injection (1-2 minutes/injection), one in each buttock. 
Fulvestrant is a competitive estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist with an affinity comparable to estradiol. 
Fulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity. 
The mechanism of action is associated with down-regulation of estrogen receptor protein levels. 
Clinical trials in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant 
significantly down-regulates ER protein in ER positive tumours compared with placebo. There was also 
a significant decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic estrogen 
agonist effects. It has also been shown that fulvestrant 500 mg downregulates ER and the proliferation 
marker Ki67, to a greater degree than fulvestrant 250 mg in breast tumours in postmenopausal 
neoadjuvant setting. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe containing 250 mg of 
fulvestrant as active substance.  
Other ingredients are benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, anhydrous ethanol and refined castor oil. 
Assessment report

The product is available in a clear type 1 glass pre-filled syringe with polypropylene plunger rod, fitted 
with a tamper-evident closure, containing 5 ml Fulvestrant Mylan solution for injection. A safety needle 
(BD SafetyGlide) for connection to the barrel is also provided, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of fulvestrant is 7α-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentylsulfinyl) nonyl]estra-
1,3,5(10)triene-3,17β-diol corresponding to the molecular formula C32H47F5O3S. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 606.77 gmol-1 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The active substance is a white or almost white non-hygroscopic powder. It shows very high 
lipophilicity and extremely low aqueous solubility. It is freely soluble in ethanol (96%) and in 
methylene chloride. The active substance is light sensitive. 
Fulvestrant exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of six chiral carbon atoms and a stereogenic 
sulfoxide in the side chain. The active substance is a mixture of 2 diastereoisomers: fulvestrant 
sulfoxide A and B. They have the same absolute configuration at each of the stereogenic centres in the 
steroid system but different absolute configurations at the sulphur atom. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. 
Polymorphism has not been observed for fulvestrant. 
As there is a monograph of fulvestrant in the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.), the manufacturer of 
the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) 
for fulvestrant which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identity (specific optical 
rotation, IR), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), 
stereochemical purity (chiral HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), bacterial 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/810299/2017  
Page 8/19 
 
 
 
 
 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). Specifications have been set for residual solvents 
methanol, ethyl acetate and toluene tested using gas chromatography (included in the CEP). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 10 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (5 ºC ± 
3 ºC) and for 8 commercial scale batches for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 
60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identity (HPLC), water content, assay, related 
substances, stereochemical purity and microbiological stability. The analytical methods used are 
stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications and no trend was observed at either condition. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch and as part of 
forced degradation study. Fulvestrant is sensitive to light, both in solution and as powder, due to 
formation of some degradation products even after a short exposure time (30 minutes for solution and 
8 hours for the powder). Therefore the active substance needs to be stored in suitably protective 
packaging. Results under stressed conditions (acid, base, oxidation, heat stressed conditions) were 
also provided. Fulvestrant is slightly sensitive to acid (plus temperature) after a prolonged exposure 
(72 hours at 60 °C with HCl). Fulvestrant is sensitive to base (plus temperature) when exposed for 
several hours (72 hours at 60 °C) and the oxidative product fulvestrant sulfone is formed. Fulvestrant 
is very sensitive to oxidation with an increase in fulvestrant sulfone up to about 9% after only 30 
minutes. Fulvestrant is slightly sensitive to heat both in solution and as powder due to formation of 
some degradation products after a prolonged exposure time for the solution and after 24 hours at 105 
°C for the powder. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 12 months when stored at 
5±3 ºC in the proposed container which comprises glass bottles in double polyethylene bags placed in 
a polyester/aluminium/polyester/polypropylene bag. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe containing 250 mg of 
fulvestrant as active substance.  
The finished product is a long-acting intramuscular depot formulation. The dosage form has been 
developed as a generic version of the centrally authorised product Faslodex which contains the same 
active substance in the same pharmaceutical form and is intended to be used via the same route of 
administration (intramuscular injection intended to be used once per month). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/810299/2017  
Page 9/19 
 
 
 
 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains Quality by Design (QbD) elements. 
As the finished product is a parenteral solution intended solely for administration by injection and 
contains the same active substance and excipients as the RMP, bioequivalence studies may not be 
required. However the sustained release properties of the formulation (and corresponding dosing 
regimen) is a critical element to assure bioequivalence. The quality and in vivo performance of the 
finished product are connected to both quantity and quality of the active substance and excipients, 
especially castor oil which contributes to the finished product viscosity and influences performance in 
vivo by modification of release rate. In order to demonstrate pharmaceutical equivalence of Fulvestrant 
Mylan and the RMP, extensive comparative studies were asked for by the CHMP during the assessment 
procedure and have been performed using multiple batches of both products. Comparative fatty-acid 
profile data between reference and generic products was also provided at the request of CHMP. The 
fatty acid profile of refined castor oil is similar to the profile of finished products, both reference and 
generic products. Overall, it can be concluded that the generic product contains the same quality and 
quantity of refined castor oil as the RMP. Therefore, the requirement of the Guideline on the 
investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr with respect to the 
demonstration of the essential similarity of the oily solution for intramuscular administration is 
considered fulfilled. 
Physicochemical characteristics of RMP Faslodex were evaluated and the results are considered 
adequate. 
The formulation and manufacturing development were evaluated through the use of risk assessment 
and design of experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process 
parameters. A risk analysis was performed in order to define critical process steps and process 
parameters that may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. The risk 
identification was based on prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing 
processes as well as on experience from formulation development, process design and scale-up 
studies. The critical process parameters have been adequately identified. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Compatibility of excipients 
and the active substance has been confirmed through stability studies. 
Aseptic processing followed by sterile filtration was chosen as the preferred method of sterilization 
based on publicly available information regarding the RMP. A terminal sterilization suitability study was 
performed. The analysis of description, assay, degree of colouration and related substances 
demonstrated that the proposed finished product is thermally unstable. 
The primary packaging consists of a syringe and a plunger stopper. The syringe is a clear type 1 glass 
syringe containing an elastomeric tip cap and polycarbonate luer lock connector and a polypropylene 
plunger rod within a polypropylene tamper-evident closure. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
A study was carried out to investigate the compatibility of the glass syringe barrel with elastomeric tip 
cap and the plunger stopper with the finished product solution. Results were found to comply with 
respect to the tested parameters after up to 6 months at accelerated conditions (25 ± 2 °C/ 60 ± 5% 
RH), demonstrating the compatibility of the finished product and container closure system. 
A study was carried out to determine the potential extractables/leachables in the container closure 
system that could leach into the finished product solution over the shelf-life. The extraction experiment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/810299/2017  
Page 10/19 
 
 
 
 
performed on the elastomeric tip cap and the plunger stopper resulted in the maximum theoretical 
maximum daily intake (MDI) values that are lower than the staged TTC of 60 microgram/day. All the 
extractables observed from rubber stoppers of the Fulvestrant injection were far below the safety 
threshold of 60 microgram/day. 
Functionality testing of the Fulvestrant Mylan syringes was performed on a single batch at release and 
end of shelf life and found to be acceptable. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  five  main  steps:  dispensing,  compounding,  sterile  filtration, 
filling,  and  labelling  and  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  manufacturing 
process  as  it  utilizes  sterile  filtration  and  aseptic  filing  to  ensure  sterility  of  the  finished  product.  The 
primary  container  components  are  purchased  pre-sterilised.  The  sterilisation  methods  for  equipment 
that comes into contact with the product during processing are described and considered acceptable. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  on  3  consecutive  commercial  scale 
batches  representative  of  the  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process.  Operating  steps  that  are 
critical to the manufacture of the finished product include dispensing, compounding, filtering and filling. 
To  ensure  product  quality,  each  batch  was  sampled  throughout  the  filtering,  filling,  and  packaging 
operations  and  multiple  physical  inspections  were  carried  out.  Bioburden  was  assessed  prior  to  the 
sterile filtration. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of 
dosage  form:  description  (in  house),  identification  (HPLC,  TLC),  volume  in  container,  uniformity  of 
dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.,  in  house),  degree  of  coloration  (in  house),  particulate  matter  (Ph.  Eur.), 
viscosity (Ph. Eur.), content of free fatty acids (titration), water content (Ph. Eur.), optical clarity (Ph. 
Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  stereochemical  purity  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC),  ethanol  content  (GC), 
sterility (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), initial force/ break loose force (force tester), mean 
dynamic  glide  force/  friction  force  (force  tester),  maximum  dynamic  glide  force/  friction  force  (force 
tester) and minimum dynamic glide force/ friction force (force tester). 
The viscosity specification was tightened during the assessment procedure as requested by the CHMP 
in order to ensure that this parameter is as close as possible to analysed reference medicinal product’s 
batches.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released to the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing.

Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of the finished product stored for up to 24 months (1 
batch) and 18 months (2 batches) under long term conditions (2 - 8 ºC) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (25 ± 2 °C / 60 ± 5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches  of  medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, identification, degree of colouration, particulate matter, viscosity, 
content  of  free  fatty  acids,  water  content,  optical  clarity,  assay,  stereochemical  purity,  related 
substances,  ethanol  content,  sterility,  bacterial  endotoxins,  initial  force/  break  loose  force,  mean 
dynamic glide force/ friction force, maximum dynamic glide force/ friction force and minimum dynamic 
glide force/ friction force. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Neither significant changes nor trends have been observed. 
A  28  days  in-use  stability  study  was  carried  out  on  a  single  batch  of  the  finished  product  in  order  to 
support  temperature  excursions  that  may  occur  over  the  shelf-life.  The  results  are  within  the 
specification and no trends were observed. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Samples  were  assessed  for  description,  identity,  degree  of 
coloration,  particulate  matter,  viscosity,  content  of  free  fatty  acids,  water  content,  optical  clarity, 
assay,  stereochemical  purity,  related  substances  and  ethanol  content.  The  finished  product  remained 
within  the  proposed  shelf-life  specifications  following  the  photostability  study.  The  result  of  this 
photostability study demonstrates that light has no impact on the quality of the finished product when 
stored  inside  the  syringe.  However  taking  into  consideration  the  limited  duration  of  the  test,  the 
recommendation proposed in the SmPC (“Store the pre-filled syringe in the original package in order to 
protect from light”) is considered appropriate. 
Forced degradation studies were performed during validation of the assay and related substances test 
methods.  The  finished  product  samples  was  stressed  with  acid  (0.1N  and  1.0N  HCl),  base  (0.1N  and 
1.0N  NaOH),  heat  (80 °C for  24h,  48h),  oxidant  (1%,  3%,  10%  H2O2)  and  light  (1.2  MW/m2).  Some 
degradation was observed on treatment with acid (0.1N HCl), 10% H2O2 oxidant, and light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months and storage conditions of “Store 
and transport refrigerated (2 °C – 8 °C). Temperature excursions outside 2 °C – 8 °C should be limited 
and not exceeding a 28 day period where the average storage temperature for the product is below 25 
°C (but above 2 °C – 8 °C). After temperature excursions, the product should be returned immediately 
to the recommended storage conditions (store and transport in a refrigerator 2 °C – 8 °C). 
Temperature excursions have a cumulative effect on the product quality and the 28 day time period 
must not be exceeded over the duration of the shelf life of Fulvestrant. Exposure to temperatures 
below 2 °C will not damage the product providing it is not stored below – 20°C. Store the pre-filled 
syringe in the original package in order to protect from light.” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are 
acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
As the finished product is a parenteral solution intended solely for administration by injection and 
contains the same active substance and excipients as the RMP, bioequivalence studies are not 
required. In order to demonstrate pharmaceutical equivalence of Fulvestrant Mylan and the RMP 
however, extensive comparative studies have been asked for by the CHMP during the assessment 
procedure and have been performed using multiple batches of both products. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers that the non-clinical overview is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific 
literature. It is agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

The  applicant  provided  an  ERA  as  per  CHMP  request.  This  determined  PECSURFACEWATER  value  is 
approximately 10-fold below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L, indicating that fulvestrant use would have to 
increase the same approximate 10-fold above the current worst-case use scenario in order to exceed 
the PEC action limit and trigger a mandatory Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis. Using the 
highest average Fpen value (0.00552%) would generate a PECSURFACEWATER value (0.00049 µg/L) that is 
approximately  20-fold  below  the  0.01  µg/L  action  limit.  Thus,  it  is  considered  that  the  use  and 
population data over the last 4 years across 27 different Member States provides adequate justification 
for  the  absence  of  specific  ERA  study  data  for  the  Fulvestrant  Mylan  250  mg  solution  for  injection 
submission and additional Phase II studies are not required. Since fulvestrant is a potential endocrine 
disruptor,  the  Applicant  additionally  addressed  public  domain  data  to  make  a  scientifically  sound 
assessment of the environmental risk, with a special interest to avoid unnecessary repetition of animal 
studies (e.g. fish). Physical chemistry data, bioconcentration data, aquatic toxicity and environmental 
fate  data  together  with  known  metabolism  of  fulvestrant  formed  adequate  justification  of  absence  of 
the Phase II studies.  
Based  on  the  physico-chemical  and  environmental  fate  properties  of  fulvestrant,  it  is  likely  that  any 
remaining  active  moiety  (after  extensive  human  metabolism)  present  in  domestic  sewage  would  be 
partitioned  into  the  sewage  sludge  during  wastewater  treatment.  Laboratory  wastewater  treatment 
simulation tests indicate that fulvestrant is completely degraded and is therefore unlikely to enter the 
aquatic  or  terrestrial  environment.  Finally,  based  upon  the  measured  bioconcentration  factor  in  fish 
(BCF  <  400),  the  risk  of  bioaccumulation  of  fulvestrant  in  aquatic  organisms  is  considered  very  low 
(BCF < 1000).  
The ERA is considered acceptable. 
The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.  
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical data and the ERA submitted in support of the authorisation of Fulvestrant 
Mylan 250 mg solution for injection are considered acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for solution for injection containing fulvestrant.  
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of fulvestrant based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the 
SmPC of the reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) in its current version, is of particular relevance.  
Exemption  
There are no bioequivalence studies submitted with this application.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/810299/2017  
Page 15/19 
 
 
 
 
In accordance with the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 
1/Corr**), Appendix II, in the case of other parenteral routes, e.g. intramuscular or subcutaneous, and 
when the test product is of the same type of solution (aqueous or oily), contains the same 
concentration of the same active substance and the same excipients in similar amounts as the 
medicinal product currently approved, bioequivalence studies are not required. 
Fulvestran Mylan contains the same active substance in the same concentration as the reference 
product. 
The Applicant provided information that the excipients contained in the proposed formulation are the 
same and in the same quantity as the ones contained in the reference product formulation. 
Fulvestran Mylan and Faslodex are medicinal products for intramuscular administration as oily solution 
and as such are anticipated to be of similar bioavailability. 
The justification for waiving bioequivalence studies is acceptable. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
No new pharmacokinetics studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.  
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
No bioequivalence studies were submitted with this application. In accordance with the Guideline on 
the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 1/Corr**), Appendix II: In the case 
of other parenteral routes, e.g. intramuscular or subcutaneous, and when the test product is of the 
same type of solution (aqueous or oily), contains the same concentration of the same active substance 
and the same excipients in similar amounts as the medicinal product currently approved, 
bioequivalence studies are not required. The justification provided by the applicant for waiving 
bioequivalence studies is acceptable. 
As the active substance fulvestrant is widely used and well-known, no further studies have been 
submitted which is considered acceptable. Fulvestrant has been used for postmenopausal women with 
hormone receptor-positive breast cancer more than 10 years and the safety profile and tolerability of 
the medicinal product is well established. Based on CONFIRM trial results, the 500 mg once-monthly 
dose of fulvestrant is now the approved dose in the European Union (approved in 2010). 
Discussion on the recent scientific publications on the pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics and 
efficacy/safety of fulvestrant were included in the Clinical overview which is considered adequate. 
The clinical parts of the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package leaflet are in line with that of 
Faslodex. The product information is also adequately reflecting excipients with known effect and 
relevant warnings in accordance with the excipients guideline.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of fulvestrant solution for injection. The reference product 
Faslodex is indicated for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer in postmenopausal women: not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or with 
disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy, or disease progression on anti-estrogen 
therapy. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of the active substance. The applicant’s clinical overview on 
these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information.

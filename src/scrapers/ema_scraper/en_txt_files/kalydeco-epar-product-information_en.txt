CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Kalydeco tablets are indicated:  
•  As monotherapy for the treatment of adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older 
and weighing 25 kg or more with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H CFTR mutation or 
one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, 
S1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
• 
In a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets for the treatment of adults, 
adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous 
for the F508del mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one of the 
following mutations in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 
3849+10kbC→T. 
• 
In a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets for the treatment of 
adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have at 
least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Kalydeco should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. 
If the patient's genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be 
performed before starting treatment to confirm the presence of an indicated mutation in the CFTR gene 
(see section 4.1). The phase of the poly-T variant identified with the R117H mutation should be 
determined in accordance with local clinical recommendations. 
Posology 
Adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older should be dosed according to Table 1.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ivacaftor have not been established in children less than 4 months of age as 
monotherapy, neither in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in children less than 6 years of age or in 
combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in children less than 2 years of age. No data are 
available. 
Limited data are available in patients less than 6 years of age with an R117H mutation in the CFTR 
gene. Available data in patients aged 6 years and older are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. 
Method of administration 
For oral use.  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole. The tablets should not be chewed, crushed, 
or broken before swallowing because there are no clinical data currently available to support other 
methods of administration. 
Ivacaftor tablets should be taken with fat-containing food. 
Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment (see section 4.5). 
4.3 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Only patients with CF who had a G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, 
S549N, S549R gating (class III), G970R or R117H mutation in at least one allele of the CFTR gene 
were included in studies 1, 2, 5 and 6 (see section 5.1). 
In study 5, four patients with the G970R mutation were included. In three of four patients the change 
in the sweat chloride test was < 5 mmol/L and this group did not demonstrate a clinically relevant 
improvement in FEV1 after 8 weeks of treatment. Clinical efficacy in patients with the G970R 
mutation of the CFTR gene could not be established (see section 5.1). 
Efficacy results from a phase 2 study in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation in the CFTR gene showed no statistically significant difference in FEV1 over 16 weeks of 
ivacaftor treatment compared to placebo (see section 5.1). Therefore, use of ivacaftor as monotherapy 
in these patients is not recommended. 
Less evidence of a positive effect of ivacaftor has been shown for patients with an R117H-7T mutation 
associated with less severe disease in study 6 (see section 5.1).  
Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor should not be prescribed in patients with 
CF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have a second CFTR mutation not listed in 
section 4.1. 
Elevated transaminases and hepatic injury 
In a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, liver failure leading to transplantation has been 
reported while receiving ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. This 
medicinal product should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing advanced liver disease 
(e.g., cirrhosis, portal hypertension) and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used 
in these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment (see sections 4.2, 
4.8, and 5.2). 
Moderate transaminase (alanine transaminase [ALT] or aspartate transaminase [AST]) elevations are 
common in subjects with CF. Transaminase elevations have been observed in some patients treated 
with ivacaftor as monotherapy and in combination regimens with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. In patients taking ivacaftor in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, these elevations have sometimes been associated with concomitant 
elevations in total bilirubin. Therefore, assessments of transaminases (ALT and AST) and total 
bilirubin are recommended for all patients prior to initiating ivacaftor, every 3 months during the first 
year of treatment and annually thereafter. For all patients with a history of liver disease or 
transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests should be considered. In the 
event of significant elevations of transaminases (e.g., patients with ALT or AST > 5 × the upper limit 
of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with bilirubin > 2 × ULN), dosing should be interrupted, 
and laboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following resolution of 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transaminase elevations, the benefits and risks of resuming treatment should be considered (see 
sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Use of ivacaftor, either as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, is not 
recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment unless the benefits are expected to outweigh 
the risks. Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with ivacaftor in a combination 
regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (see Table 3 in section 4.2, and sections 4.8 and 5.2).  
For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, use of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor is not recommended. Treatment should only be considered when there 
is a clear medical need and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used 
with caution at a reduced dose (see Table 3 in section 4.2, and sections 4.8 and 5.2). 
Depression 
Depression (including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) has been reported in patients while 
receiving ivacaftor, mainly in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, usually occurring within three months of treatment initiation and in 
patients with a history of psychiatric disorders. In some cases, symptom improvement was reported 
after dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Patients (and caregivers) should be alerted about the 
need to monitor for depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in behaviour and to seek 
medical advice immediately if these symptoms present.  
Renal impairment 
Caution is recommended while using ivacaftor in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage 
renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Patients after organ transplantation 
Ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ transplantation. 
Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for interactions with 
ciclosporin or tacrolimus. 
Rash events  
The incidence of rash events with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor was higher in females than in males, particularly in females taking 
hormonal contraceptives. A role for hormonal contraceptives in the occurrence of rash cannot be 
excluded. For patients taking hormonal contraceptives who develop rash, interrupting treatment with 
ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor and hormonal contraceptives 
should be considered. Following the resolution of rash, it should be considered if resuming ivacaftor in 
a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor without hormonal contraceptives is 
appropriate. If rash does not recur, resumption of hormonal contraceptives can be considered (see 
section 4.8).  
Interactions with medicinal products 
CYP3A inducers 
Exposure to ivacaftor is significantly decreased by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, 
potentially resulting in the loss of ivacaftor efficacy; therefore, co-administration of ivacaftor with 
strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5).  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CYP3A inhibitors 
Exposure to ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor are increased when co-administered with strong or 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors. The dose of ivacaftor must be adjusted when used concomitantly with 
strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.5). 
Paediatric population 
Cases of non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts without impact on vision have been reported in 
paediatric patients treated with ivacaftor and ivacaftor-containing regimens. Although other risk 
factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible 
risk attributable to treatment with ivacaftor cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up 
ophthalmological examinations are recommended in paediatric patients initiating ivacaftor treatment 
(see section 5.3). 
Excipients with known effect 
Lactose 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Ivacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp) and a potential inhibitor of CYP2C9. In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for 
P-gp.  
Medicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor 
CYP3A inducers 
Co-administration of ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased ivacaftor exposure 
(AUC) by 89% and decreased hydroxymethyl ivacaftor (M1) to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. 
Co-administration of ivacaftor with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampicin, rifabutin, 
phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
No dose adjustment is recommended when ivacaftor is used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers.  
CYP3A inhibitors 
Ivacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor, increased ivacaftor exposure (measured as area under the curve [AUC]) by 8.5-fold and 
increased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the ivacaftor dose is recommended for 
co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, 
voriconazole, telithromycin and clarithromycin (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.4). 
Co-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased ivacaftor exposure by 
3-fold and increased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the ivacaftor dose is 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended for patients taking concomitant moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole, 
erythromycin, and verapamil (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.4). 
Co-administration of ivacaftor with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that 
moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure to ivacaftor. Food or drink containing grapefruit 
should be avoided during treatment with ivacaftor (see section 4.2). 
Potential for ivacaftor to interact with transporters 
In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Ivacaftor and its 
metabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro. Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood 
of being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of 
ivacaftor and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not expected to be 
clinically relevant.  
Ciprofloxacin 
Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with ivacaftor did not affect the exposure of ivacaftor. No dose 
adjustment is required when ivacaftor is co-administered with ciprofloxacin. 
Medicinal products affected by ivacaftor 
Administration of ivacaftor may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive 
substrates of CYP2C9, and/or P-gp, and/or CYP3A which may increase or prolong their therapeutic 
effect and adverse reactions. 
CYP2C9 substrates 
Ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, monitoring of the international normalised ratio (INR) is 
recommended during co-administration of warfarin with ivacaftor. Other medicinal products for which 
exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should be used 
with caution. 
Digoxin and other P-gp substrates 
Co-administration with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, 
consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of ivacaftor may increase 
systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or 
prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other 
substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus or 
tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used. 
CYP3A substrates  
Co-administration with (oral) midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased midazolam exposure 
1.5-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of CYP3A by ivacaftor. No dose adjustment of CYP3A 
substrates, such as midazolam, alprazolam, diazepam or triazolam, is required when these are 
co-administered with ivacaftor.  
Hormonal contraceptives 
Ivacaftor has been studied with an oestrogen/progesterone oral contraceptive and was found to have no 
significant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. Therefore, no dose adjustment of oral 
contraceptives is necessary.

Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ivacaftor in 
pregnant women. Animals studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
ivacaftor during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Limited data show that ivacaftor is excreted into human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain 
from ivacaftor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data available on the effect of ivacaftor on fertility in humans. Ivacaftor had an effect on 
fertility in rats (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ivacaftor has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Ivacaftor may cause dizziness 
(see section 4.8) and, therefore, patients experiencing dizziness should be advised not to drive or use 
machines until symptoms abate. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 6 years and older who received 
ivacaftor are headache (23.9%), oropharyngeal pain (22.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.0%), 
nasal congestion (20.2%), abdominal pain (15.6%), nasopharyngitis (14.7%), diarrhoea (12.8%), 
dizziness (9.2%), rash (12.8%) and bacteria in sputum (12.8%). Transaminase elevations occurred in 
12.8% of ivacaftor-treated patients versus 11.5% of placebo-treated patients. 
In patients aged 2 to less than 6 years the most common adverse reactions were nasal congestion 
(26.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (23.5%), transaminase elevations (14.7%), rash (11.8%), and 
bacteria in sputum (11.8%). 
Serious adverse reactions included abdominal pain (0.9%) and transaminase elevations (1.8%) in 
patients who received ivacaftor, while serious adverse reactions of rash were reported in 1.5% patients 
aged 12 years and older treated with a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (see 
section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 4 reflects the adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor monotherapy in clinical trials (placebo-
controlled and uncontrolled studies) in which the length of exposure to ivacaftor ranged from 16 weeks 
to 144 weeks. Additional adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor and/or in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor are also 
provided in Table 4. The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10);

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Transaminase elevations 
During the 48-week placebo-controlled studies 1 and 2 of ivacaftor as monotherapy in patients aged 
6 years and older, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) > 8, > 5 or > 3 × ULN was 
3.7%, 3.7% and 8.3% in ivacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.9% and 8.7% in placebo-treated 
patients, respectively. Two patients, one on placebo and one on ivacaftor permanently discontinued 
treatment for elevated transaminases, each > 8 × ULN. No ivacaftor-treated patients experienced a 
transaminase elevation > 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN. In 
ivacaftor-treated patients, most transaminase elevations up to 5 × ULN resolved without treatment 
interruption. Ivacaftor dosing was interrupted in most patients with transaminase elevations > 5 × 
ULN. In all instances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently 
resumed, ivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4). 
During the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (up to 24 weeks) of tezacaftor/ivacaftor, the incidence of 
maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) > 8, > 5, or > 3 × ULN were 0.2%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor treated patients, and 0.4%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in placebo-treated patients. One patient 
(0.2%) on therapy and 2 patients (0.4%) on placebo permanently discontinued treatment for elevated 
transaminases. No patients treated with tezacaftor/ivacaftor experienced a transaminase elevation > 3 × 
ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin > 2 × ULN.  
During the 24-week, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, these 
figures were 1.5%, 2.5%, and 7.9% in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.5%, 
and 5.5% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations 
was 10.9% in ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor treated patients 
and 4.0% in placebo-treated patients.  
Post-marketing cases of treatment discontinuation due to elevated transaminases have been reported 
(see section 4.4). 
Rash events 
Rash events, generally mild to moderate in severity, have been observed with the use of ivacaftor in a 
combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor and occurred more frequently in female-
treated patients (16.3%) and in those taking hormonal contraceptives (20.5%) (see section 4.4). 
Increased creatine phosphokinase 
Generally transient and asymptomatic increases in creatine phosphokinase were observed in patients 
treated with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, which did not 
lead to treatment discontinuation. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Increased blood pressure 
An increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 3.5 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, 
respectively was observed in patients treated with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor.  
Paediatric population 
The safety data of ivacaftor as monotherapy were evaluated in 6 patients between 4 months to less than 
6 months of age, 11 patients between 6 months to less than 12 months of age, 19 patients between 
12 months to less than 24 months of age, 34 patients between 2 to less than 6 years of age, 61 patients 
between 6 to less than 12 years of age and 94 patients between 12 to less than 18 years of age.  
The safety profile of ivacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen) is generally consistent 
among paediatric patients and is also consistent with adult patients. 
The incidence of transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) observed in studies 2, 5 and 6 (patients aged 
6 to less than 12 years), study 7 (patients aged 2 to less than 6 years), and study 8 (patients aged 4 to 
less than 24 months) are described in Table 5. In the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of 
transaminase elevations were similar between treatment with ivacaftor (15.0%) and placebo (14.6%). 
Peak LFT elevations were generally higher in paediatric patients than in older patients. Across all 
populations, peak LFT elevations returned to baseline levels following interruption, and in almost all 
instances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, 
ivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4). Cases suggestive of positive 
rechallenge were observed. In study 7 ivacaftor was permanently discontinued in one patient. In 
study 8 no patients had elevations in total bilirubin or discontinued ivacaftor treatment due to 
transaminase elevations in either age cohort (see section 4.4 for management of elevated 
transaminases).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
No specific antidote is available for overdose with ivacaftor. Treatment of overdose consists of general 
supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs, liver function tests and observation of the 
clinical status of the patient.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX02 
Mechanism of action 
Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein, i.e., in vitro ivacaftor increases CFTR channel gating to 
enhance chloride transport in specified gating mutations (as listed in section 4.1) with reduced 
channel-open probability compared to normal CFTR. Ivacaftor also potentiated the channel-open 
probability of R117H-CFTR, which has both low channel-open probability (gating) and reduced 
channel current amplitude (conductance). The G970R mutation causes a splicing defect resulting in 
little-to-no CFTR protein at the cell surface which may explain the results observed in subjects with 
this mutation in study 5 (see Pharmacodynamic effects and Clinical efficacy and safety). 
In vitro responses seen in single channel patch clamp experiments using membrane patches from 
rodent cells expressing mutant CFTR forms do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic 
response (e.g., sweat chloride) or clinical benefit. The exact mechanism leading ivacaftor to potentiate 
the gating activity of normal and some mutant CFTR forms in this system has not been completely 
elucidated. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Ivacaftor as monotherapy 
In studies 1 and 2 in patients with the G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene, ivacaftor led to 
rapid (15 days), substantial (the mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 
was -48 mmol/L [95% CI -51, -45] and -54 mmol/L [95% CI -62, -47], respectively) and sustained 
(through 48 weeks) reductions in sweat chloride concentration. 
In study 5, part 1 in patients who had a non-G551D gating mutation in the CFTR gene, treatment with 
ivacaftor led to a rapid (15 days) and substantial mean change from baseline in sweat chloride 
of -49 mmol/L (95% CI -57, -41) through 8 weeks of treatment. However, in patients with the 
G970R-CFTR mutation, the mean (SD) absolute change in sweat chloride at week 8 was -6.25 
(6.55) mmol/L. Similar results to part 1 were seen in part 2 of the study. At the 4-week follow-up visit 
(4 weeks after dosing with ivacaftor ended), mean sweat chloride values for each group were trending 
to pre-treatment levels. 
In study 6 in patients aged 6 years or older with CF who had an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene, 
the treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through 24 weeks of 
treatment was -24 mmol/L (95% CI -28, -20). In subgroup analyses by age, the treatment difference 
was -21.87 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.46, -17.28) in patients aged 18 years or older, and -27.63 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -37.16, -18.10) in patients aged 6 to 11 years. Two patients 12 to 17 years of age were 
enrolled in this study. 
Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor 
In patients homozygous for the F508del mutation, the treatment difference between ivacaftor in 
combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor and placebo in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat 
chloride through week 24, was -10.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.4, -8.8). 
In patients heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation associated with residual 
CFTR activity, the treatment difference in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride 
through week 8 was -9.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.7, -7.3) between tezacaftor/ivacaftor and placebo, 
and -4.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -6.7, -2.3) between ivacaftor and placebo. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who were homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del 
mutation and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity, mean within-group absolute 
change in sweat chloride from baseline at week 8 was -12.3 mmol/L (95% CI: -15.3, -9.3) in the 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor group. 
Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor 
In patients with an F508del mutation on one allele and a mutation on the second allele that predicts 
either no production of a CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that does not transport chloride and is not 
responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor (minimal function mutation) in vitro, the treatment 
difference of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor compared to placebo for mean absolute change in sweat 
chloride from baseline through week 24 was -41.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.4, -39.3). 
In patients homozygous for the F508del mutation, the treatment difference of 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor compared to tezacaftor/ivacaftor for mean absolute change in sweat 
chloride from baseline at week 4 was -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -50.1, -40.1). 
In patients heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele with a gating 
defect or residual CFTR activity, the treatment difference of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor compared 
to the control group (ivacaftor monotherapy group plus tezacaftor/ivacaftor group) for mean absolute 
change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 8 was -23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.1, -20.1). 
In patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the 
F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation, the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from 
baseline (n=62) through week 24 (n=60) was -60.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2)*. The mean 
absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 12 (n=59) was -58.6 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -61.1, -56.1). 
* Not all participants included in the analyses had data available for all follow-up visits, especially 
from week 16 onwards. The ability to collect data at week 24 was hampered by the COVID-19 
pandemic. Week 12 data were less impacted by the pandemic. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Ivacaftor as monotherapy 
Studies 1 and 2: studies in patients with CF with G551D gating mutations 
The efficacy of ivacaftor has been evaluated in two phase 3 randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multi-centre studies of clinically stable patients with CF who had the G551D 
mutation in the CFTR gene on at least one allele and had FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted. 
Patients in both studies were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every 
12 hours with food containing fat for 48 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies (e.g., 
tobramycin, dornase alfa). The use of inhaled hypertonic sodium chloride was not permitted. 
Study 1 evaluated 161 patients who were 12 years of age or older; 122 (75.8%) patients had the 
F508del mutation in the second allele. At the start of the study, patients in the placebo group used 
some medicinal products at a higher frequency than the ivacaftor group. These medicinal products 
included dornase alfa (73.1% versus 65.1%), salbutamol (53.8% versus 42.2%), tobramycin (44.9% 
versus 33.7%) and salmeterol/fluticasone (41.0% versus 27.7%). At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 
was 63.6% (range: 31.6% to 98.2%) and mean age was 26 years (range: 12 to 53 years). 
Study 2 evaluated 52 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age at screening; mean (SD) body weight was 
30.9 (8.63) kg; 42 (80.8%) patients had the F508del mutation in the second allele. At baseline, mean 
predicted FEV1 was 84.2% (range: 44.0% to 133.8%) and mean age was 9 years (range: 6 to 12 years); 
8 (30.8%) patients in the placebo group and 4 (15.4%) patients in the ivacaftor group had an FEV1 less 
than 70% predicted at baseline. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the mean absolute change from baseline in percent 
predicted FEV1 through 24 weeks of treatment. 
The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in 
percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 was 10.6 percentage points (8.6, 12.6) in study 
1 and 12.5 percentage points (6.6, 18.3) in study 2. The treatment difference between ivacaftor and 
placebo for the mean relative change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through 
week 24 was 17.1% (13.9, 20.2) in study 1 and 15.8% (8.4, 23.2) in study 2. The mean change from 
baseline through week 24 in FEV1 (L) was 0.37 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.01 L in the placebo 
group in study 1 and 0.30 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.07 L in the placebo group in study 2. In both 
studies, improvements in FEV1 were rapid in onset (day 15) and durable through 48 weeks. 
The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in 
percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients 12 to 17 years of age in study 1 was 
11.9 percentage points (5.9, 17.9). The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the 
mean absolute change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients 
with baseline predicted FEV1 greater than 90% in study 2 was 6.9 percentage points (-3.8, 17.6). 
The results for clinically relevant secondary endpoints are shown in Table 6.

Study 5: study in patients with CF with non-G551D gating mutations 
Study 5 was a phase 3, two-part, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study 
(part 1) followed by a 16-week open-label extension period (part 2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 years and older who have a G970R or non-G551D gating 
mutation in the CFTR gene (G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P or G1349D). 
In part 1, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every 12 hours 
with fat-containing food for 8 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies and crossed over to 
the other treatment for the second 8 weeks after a 4- to 8-week washout period. The use of inhaled 
hypertonic saline was not permitted. In part 2, all patients received ivacaftor as indicated in part 1 for 
16 additional weeks. The duration of continuous ivacaftor treatment was 24 weeks for patients 
randomised to part 1 placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence and 16 weeks for patients randomised to 
part 1 ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence. 
Thirty-nine patients (mean age 23 years) with baseline FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted (mean FEV1 78% 
predicted [range: 43% to 119%]) were enrolled. Sixty-two percent (24/39) of them carried the 
F508del-CFTR mutation in the second allele. A total of 36 patients continued into part 2 (18 per 
treatment sequence). 
In part 1 of study 5, the mean FEV1 percent predicted at baseline in placebo-treated patients was 
79.3% while in ivacaftor-treated patients this value was 76.4%. The mean overall post-baseline value 
was 76.0% and 83.7%, respectively. The mean absolute change from baseline through week 8 in 
percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 7.5% in the ivacaftor period and -3.2% in the 
placebo period. The observed treatment difference (95% CI) between ivacaftor and placebo was 10.7% 
(7.3, 14.1) (P < 0.0001). 
The effect of ivacaftor in the overall population of study 5 (including the secondary endpoints absolute 
change in BMI at 8 weeks of treatment and absolute change in the respiratory domain score of the 
CFQ-R through 8 weeks of treatment) and by individual mutation (absolute change in sweat chloride 
and in percent predicted FEV1 at week 8) is shown in Table 7. Based on clinical (percent predicted 
FEV1) and pharmacodynamic (sweat chloride) responses to ivacaftor, efficacy in patients with the 
G970R mutation could not be established.

In part 2 of study 5, the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 following 16 weeks 
(patients randomised to the ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence in part 1) of continuous ivacaftor 
treatment was 10.4% (13.2%). At the follow-up visit, 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the 
mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2 week 16 was -5.9% (9.4%). For 
patients randomised to the placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence in part 1 there was a further mean 
(SD) change of 3.3% (9.3%) in percent predicted FEV1 after the additional 16 weeks of treatment with 
ivacaftor. At the follow up visit, 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the mean (SD) absolute 
change in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2 week 16 was -7.4% (5.5%). 
Study 3: study in patients with CF with the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene 
Study 3 (part A) was a 16-week, 4:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
phase 2 study of ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 hours) in 140 patients with CF aged 12 years and older 
who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene and who had FEV1 ≥ 40% 
predicted. 
The mean absolute change from baseline through week 16 in percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy 
endpoint) was 1.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and -0.2 percentage points in the placebo 
group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 1.7 percentage points 
(95% CI -0.6, 4.1); this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). 
Study 4: open-label extension study 
In study 4 patients who completed treatment in studies 1 and 2 with placebo were switched to ivacaftor 
while patients on ivacaftor continued to receive it for a minimum of 96 weeks, i.e., the length of 
treatment with ivacaftor was at least 96 weeks for patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group and at least 
144 weeks for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. 
One hundred and forty-four (144) patients from study 1 were rolled over in study 4, 67 in the 
placebo/ivacaftor group and 77 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Forty-eight (48) patients from study 2 
were rolled over in study 4, 22 in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 26 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. 
Table 8 shows the results of the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 for both groups 
of patients. For patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group baseline percent predicted FEV1 is that of 
study 4 while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group the baseline value is that of studies 1 and 2.

When the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 is compared from study 4 baseline for 
patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n = 72) who rolled over from study 1, the mean (SD) absolute 
change in percent predicted FEV1 was 0.0% (9.05), while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group 
(n = 25) who rolled over from study 2 this figure was 0.6% (9.1). This shows that patients in the 
ivacaftor/ivacaftor group maintained the improvement seen at week 48 of the initial study (day 0 
through week 48) in percent predicted FEV1 through week 144. There were no additional 
improvements in study 4 (week 48 through week 144). 
For patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group from study 1, the annualised rate of pulmonary 
exacerbations was higher in the initial study when patients were on placebo (1.34 events/year) than 
during the subsequent study 4 when patients rolled over to ivacaftor (0.48 events/year across day 1 to 
week 48, and 0.67 events/year across weeks 48 to 96). For patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group 
from study 1, the annualised rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 0.57 events/year across day 1 to 
week 48 when patients were on ivacaftor. When they rolled over into study 4, the rate of annualised 
pulmonary exacerbations was 0.91 events/year across day 1 to week 48 and 0.77 events/year across 
weeks 48 to 96. 
For patients who rolled over from study 2 the number of events was, overall, low. 
Study 6: study in patients with CF with an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene 
Study 6 evaluated 69 patients who were 6 years of age or older; 53 (76.8%) patients had the F508del 
mutation in the second allele. The confirmed R117H poly-T variant was 5T in 38 patients and 7T in 
16 patients. At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was 73% (range: 32.5% to 105.5%) and mean age was 
31 years (range: 6 to 68 years). The mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent 
predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 2.57 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and 
0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus 
placebo was 2.1 percentage points (95% CI -1.1, 5.4). 
A pre-planned subgroup analysis was conducted in patients aged 18 years and older (26 patients on 
placebo and 24 patients on ivacaftor). Treatment with ivacaftor resulted in a mean absolute change in 
percent predicted FEV1 through week 24 of 4.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group 
versus -0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor 
versus placebo was 5.0 percentage points (95% CI 1.1, 8.8). 
In a subgroup analysis in patients with a confirmed R117H-5T genetic variant, the difference in the 
mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent predicted FEV1 between ivacaftor and 
placebo was 5.3% (95% CI 1.3, 9.3). In patients with a confirmed R117H-7T genetic variant, the 
treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo was 0.2% (95% CI -8.1, 8.5).

For secondary efficacy variables, no treatment differences were observed for ivacaftor versus placebo 
in absolute change from baseline in BMI at week 24 or time to first pulmonary exacerbation. 
Treatment differences were observed in absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score through 
week 24 (treatment difference of ivacaftor versus placebo was 8.4 [95% CI 2.2, 14.6] points) and for 
the mean change from baseline in sweat chloride (see Pharmacodynamic effects). 
Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor 
The efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with 
CF aged 12 years and older was assessed in two clinical studies; a 24 week, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study with 504 patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation; and a 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and ivacaftor-controlled, 2 period, 3 treatment, 8-week 
crossover study with 244 patients who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second 
mutation associated with residual CFTR activity. The long-term safety and efficacy of the combination 
regimen was also assessed in both patient populations in a 96-week open-label, rollover, long-term 
extension study. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of tezacaftor/ivacaftor for additional 
data. 
The efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in 
patients aged 12 years and older was demonstrated in three, phase 3, randomised, double blind, 
placebo-controlled (patients were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation with minimal 
function on the second allele, n = 403) and active-controlled (patients were homozygous for the 
F508del mutation, n = 107, or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a gating or residual CFTR 
activity mutation on the second allele, n = 258) studies of 24, 4, and 8 weeks of duration respectively. 
Patients from all studies were eligible to enter open-label, rollover, long-term extension studies. Refer 
to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor for additional data. 
Paediatric population 
Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor 
The efficacy and safety in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age 8.6 years) were assessed in 
an 8-week, double-blind, phase 3 trial with 67 patients who were randomised 4:1 to either ivacaftor in 
a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or a blinding group. Forty-two patients were 
homozygous for the F508del mutation (F/F) and 12 were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a 
second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity (F/RF). Patients were eligible to enter an 
open-label, rollover, 96-week study. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor for additional data. 
Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor 
The pharmacokinetics and safety in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (n = 66) and in those from 2 
to less than 6 years (n = 75) who have at least one F508del mutation were assessed in two 24-week 
open-label studies. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor 
for additional data. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Kalydeco in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF. 
After oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) 
for AUC and Cmax were 10600 (5260) ng*hr/mL and 768 (233) ng/mL, respectively. After every 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12-hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ivacaftor were reached by days 3 to 5, with an 
accumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9. 
Absorption 
Following multiple oral dose administrations of ivacaftor, the exposure of ivacaftor generally 
increased with dose from 25 mg every 12 hours to 450 mg every 12 hours. When given with fat-
containing food, the exposure of ivacaftor increased approximately 2.5- to 4-fold. When co-
administered with tezacaftor and elexacaftor, the increase in AUC was similar (approximately 3-fold 
and 2.5-to 4-fold respectively). Therefore, ivacaftor, administered as monotherapy or in a combination 
regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, should be administered with 
fat-containing food. The median (range) tmax is approximately 4.0 (3.0; 6.0) hours in the fed state. 
Ivacaftor granules (2 × 75 mg sachets) had similar bioavailability as the 150 mg tablet when given 
with fat-containing food to healthy adult subjects. The geometric least squares mean ratio (90% CI) for 
the granules relative to tablets was 0.951 (0.839, 1.08) for AUC0-∞ and 0.918 (0.750, 1.12) for Cmax. 
The effect of food on ivacaftor absorption is similar for both formulations, i.e., tablets and granules. 
Distribution 
Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and 
albumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells. After oral administration of 
ivacaftor150 mg every 12 hours for 7 days in healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) 
apparent volume of distribution was 353 L (122). 
Biotransformation 
Ivacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is 
primarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. 
M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. 
M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. 
The effect of the CYP3A4*22 heterozygous genotype on ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor 
exposure is consistent with the effect of co-administration of a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is not 
clinically relevant. No dose-adjustment of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, or elexacaftor is considered necessary. 
The effect in CYP3A4*22 homozygous genotype patients is expected to be stronger. However, no data 
are available for such patients. 
Elimination 
Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) was eliminated 
in the faeces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for 
approximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible 
urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately 
12 hours following a single dose in the fed state. The apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was 
similar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The mean (± SD) CL/F for a single 150 mg dose was 
17.3 (8.4) L/hr in healthy subjects. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are generally linear with respect to time or dose ranging from 
25 mg to 250 mg.

Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Following a single dose of 150 mg of ivacaftor, adult subjects with moderately impaired hepatic 
function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had similar ivacaftor Cmax (mean [± SD] of 735 
[331] ng/mL) but an approximately two-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC0-∞ (mean [± SD] of 16800 
[6140] ng∙hr/mL) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Simulations for 
predicting the steady-state exposure of ivacaftor showed that by reducing the dose from 150 mg q12h 
to 150 mg once daily, adults with moderate hepatic impairment would have comparable steady-state 
Cmin values as those obtained with a dose of 150 mg q12h in adults without hepatic impairment. 
In subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9), ivacaftor 
AUC increased approximately by 50% following multiple doses for 10 days of either tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor or of ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor. 
The impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C, score 10 to15) on the pharmacokinetics 
of ivacaftor has not been studied. The magnitude of increase in exposure in these patients is unknown 
but is expected to be higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
For guidance on appropriate use and dose modification see Table 3 in section 4.2. 
Renal impairment 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with ivacaftor in patients with renal impairment. In 
a human pharmacokinetic study with ivacaftor monotherapy, there was minimal elimination of 
ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine). 
There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent (less than 0.01% following a 
single oral dose of 500 mg). 
No dose adjustments are recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment. Caution is 
recommended when administering ivacaftor to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Race 
Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of ivacaftor in white (n = 379) and non-white 
(n = 29) patients based on a population PK analysis. 
Gender 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor are similar in males and females. 
Elderly 
Clinical studies of ivacaftor did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to 
determine whether pharmacokinetic parameters are similar or not to those in younger adults. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor in the elderly patients 
(65-72 years) are comparable to those in younger adults.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. 
Pregnancy and fertility 
Ivacaftor was associated with slight decreases of the seminal vesicle weights, a decrease of overall 
fertility index and number of pregnancies in females mated with treated males and significant 
reductions in number of corpora lutea and implantation sites with subsequent reductions in the average 
litter size and average number of viable embryos per litter in treated females. The 
No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings provides an exposure level of 
approximately 4 times the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as 
ivacaftor monotherapy in adult humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). 
Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. 
Peri- and post-natal development 
Ivacaftor decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in pup body weights. The 
NOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level of approximately 3 times 
the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy in 
adult humans at the MRHD.

Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through 35 at ivacaftor 
exposure levels of 0.22 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites 
when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy. This finding has not been observed in foetuses derived 
from rat dams treated with ivacaftor on gestation days 7 to 17, in rat pups exposed to ivacaftor through 
milk ingestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week old rats, nor in 3.5 to 5-month old dogs treated with 
ivacaftor. The potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Kalydeco granules are indicated: 
•  As monotherapy for the treatment of infants aged at least 4 months, toddlers and children weighing 
5 kg to less than 25 kg with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H CFTR mutation or one of the 
following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, 
G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
• 
In a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
(CF) in paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who have at least one F508del mutation in 
the CFTR gene (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Kalydeco should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. 
If the patient's genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be 
performed before starting treatment to confirm the presence of an indicated mutation in at least one 
allele of the CFTR gene (see section 4.1). The phase of the poly-T variant identified with the R117H 
mutation should be determined in accordance with local clinical recommendation.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ivacaftor have not been established in children less than 4 months of age as 
monotherapy or in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in children less than 2 years of 
age. No data are available.  
Limited data are available in patients less than 6 years of age with an R117H mutation in the CFTR 
gene. Available data in patients aged 6 years and older are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. 
Method of administration  
For oral use. 
Each sachet is for single use only. 
Each sachet of granules should be mixed with 5 mL of age-appropriate soft food or liquid and 
completely and immediately consumed. Food or liquid should be at room temperature or below. If not 
33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
immediately consumed, the mixture has been shown to be stable for one hour and therefore should be 
ingested during this period. A fat-containing meal or snack should be consumed just before or just 
after dosing. 
Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment (see section 4.5). 
4.3 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Only patients with CF who had a G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N 
or S549R gating (class III) or G970R mutation in at least one allele of the CFTR gene were included in 
studies 1, 2, 5 and 7 (see section 5.1). 
Less evidence of a positive effect of ivacaftor has been shown for patients with an R117H-7T mutation 
associated with less severe disease in study 6 (see section 5.1). 
In study 5, four patients with the G970R mutation were included. In three of four patients the change 
in the sweat chloride test was < 5 mmol/L and this group did not demonstrate a clinically relevant 
improvement in FEV1 after 8 weeks of treatment. Clinical efficacy in patients with the G970R 
mutation of the CFTR gene could not be established (see section 5.1). 
Efficacy results from a phase 2 study in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation in the CFTR gene showed no statistically significant difference in FEV1 over 16 weeks of 
ivacaftor treatment compared to placebo (see section 5.1). Therefore, use of ivacaftor as monotherapy 
in these patients is not recommended. 
Elevated transaminases and hepatic injury 
In a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, liver failure leading to transplantation has been 
reported while receiving ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. This 
medicinal product should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing advanced liver disease 
(e.g., cirrhosis, portal hypertension) and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used 
in these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment (see sections 4.2, 
4.8, and 5.2). 
Moderate transaminase (alanine transaminase [ALT] or aspartate transaminase [AST]) elevations are 
common in subjects with CF. Transaminase elevations have been observed in some patients treated 
with ivacaftor as monotherapy and in combination regimens with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. In 
patients taking ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, these 
elevations have sometimes been associated with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. Therefore, 
assessments of transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin are recommended for all patients 
prior to initiating ivacaftor, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. 
For all patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of 
liver function tests should be considered. In the event of significant elevations of transaminases (e.g., 
patients with ALT or AST > 5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN), dosing should be interrupted, and laboratory tests closely followed until the 
abnormalities resolve. Following resolution of transaminase elevations, the benefits and risks of 
resuming treatment should be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Use of ivacaftor as monotherapy  is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. Patients with severe hepatic impairment should 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not be treated with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (see Table 
3 in section 4.2, and sections 4.8 and 5.2).  
Use of ivacaftor as monotherapy in patients aged 4 months to less than 6 months with moderate 
hepatic impairment is not recommended unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks.  
For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, use of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor is not recommended. Treatment should only be considered when there 
is a clear medical need and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used 
with caution at a reduced dose (see Table 3 in section 4.2, and sections 4.8 and 5.2). 
Depression 
Depression (including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) has been reported in patients while 
receiving ivacaftor, mainly in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, usually 
occurring within three months of treatment initiation and in patients with a history of psychiatric 
disorders. In some cases, symptom improvement was reported after dose reduction or treatment 
discontinuation. Patients (and caregivers) should be alerted about the need to monitor for depressed 
mood, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if 
these symptoms present.  
Renal impairment 
Caution is recommended while using ivacaftor in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage 
renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Patients after organ transplantation 
Ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ transplantation. 
Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for interactions with 
ciclosporin or tacrolimus. 
Rash events  
The incidence of rash events with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor was higher in females than in males, particularly in females taking 
hormonal contraceptives. A role for hormonal contraceptives in the occurrence of rash cannot be 
excluded. For patients taking hormonal contraceptives who develop rash, interrupting treatment with 
ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor and hormonal contraceptives 
should be considered. Following the resolution of rash, it should be considered if resuming ivacaftor in 
a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor without hormonal contraceptives is 
appropriate. If rash does not recur, resumption of hormonal contraceptives can be considered (see 
section 4.8). 
Interactions with medicinal products 
CYP3A inducers  
Exposure to ivacaftor is significantly decreased by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, 
potentially resulting in the loss of ivacaftor efficacy; therefore, co-administration of ivacaftor with 
strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
CYP3A inhibitors  
Exposure to ivacaftor is increased when co-administered with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 
The dose of ivacaftor must be adjusted when used concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inhibitors. Ivacaftor use is not recommended in children aged 4 to less than 6 months unless the 
benefits outweigh the risks (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.5).  
Paediatric population  
Cases of non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts without impact on vision have been reported in 
paediatric patients treated with ivacaftor and ivacaftor-containing regimens. Although other risk 
factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible 
risk attributable to treatment with ivacaftor cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up 
ophthalmological examinations are recommended in paediatric patients initiating ivacaftor treatment 
(see section 5.3). 
Excipients with known effect 
Lactose 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Ivacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp) and a potential inhibitor of CYP2C9. In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for 
P-gp.  
Medicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor 
CYP3A inducers 
Co-administration of ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased ivacaftor exposure 
(AUC) by 89% and decreased hydroxymethyl ivacaftor (M1) to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. 
Co-administration of ivacaftor with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampicin, rifabutin, 
phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
No dose adjustment is recommended when ivacaftor is used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers.  
CYP3A inhibitors 
Ivacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor, increased ivacaftor exposure (measured as area under the curve [AUC]) by 8.5-fold and 
increased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the ivacaftor dose is recommended for 
co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, 
voriconazole, telithromycin and clarithromycin (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.4). 
Co-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased ivacaftor exposure by 
3-fold and increased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the ivacaftor dose is 
recommended for patients taking concomitant moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole, 
erythromycin, and verapamil (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.4). 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of ivacaftor with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that 
moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure to ivacaftor. Food or drink containing grapefruit 
should be avoided during treatment with ivacaftor (see section 4.2). 
Potential for ivacaftor to interact with transporters 
In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Ivacaftor and its 
metabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro. Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood 
of being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of 
ivacaftor and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not expected to be 
clinically relevant.  
Ciprofloxacin 
Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with ivacaftor did not affect the exposure of ivacaftor. No dose 
adjustment is required when ivacaftor is co-administered with ciprofloxacin. 
Medicinal products affected by ivacaftor 
Administration of ivacaftor may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive 
substrates of CYP2C9, and/or P-gp, and/or CYP3A which may increase or prolong their therapeutic 
effect and adverse reactions. 
CYP2C9 substrates 
Ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, monitoring of the international normalised ratio (INR) is 
recommended during co-administration of warfarin with ivacaftor. Other medicinal products for which 
exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should be used 
with caution. 
Digoxin and other P-gp substrates 
Co-administration with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, 
consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of ivacaftor may increase 
systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or 
prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other 
substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus or 
tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used. 
CYP3A substrates  
Co-administration with (oral) midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased midazolam exposure 
1.5-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of CYP3A by ivacaftor. No dose adjustment of CYP3A 
substrates, such as midazolam, alprazolam, diazepam or triazolam, is required when these are co-
administered with ivacaftor.  
Hormonal contraceptives 
Ivacaftor been studied with an oestrogen/progesterone oral contraceptive and was found to have no 
significant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. Therefore, no dose adjustment of oral 
contraceptives is necessary. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ivacaftor in 
pregnant women. Animals studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable avoid the use of 
ivacaftor during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Limited data show that ivacaftor is excreted into human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain 
from ivacaftor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data available on the effect of ivacaftor on fertility in humans. Ivacaftor had an effect on 
fertility in rats (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ivacaftor has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Ivacaftor may cause dizziness 
(see section 4.8) and, therefore, patients experiencing dizziness should be advised not to drive or use 
machines until symptoms abate. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 6 years and older are headache 
(23.9%), oropharyngeal pain (22.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.0%), nasal congestion 
(20.2%), abdominal pain (15.6%), nasopharyngitis (14.7%), diarrhoea (12.8%), dizziness (9.2%), rash 
(12.8%) and bacteria in sputum (12.8%). Transaminase elevations occurred in 12.8% of 
ivacaftor-treated patients versus 11.5% of placebo-treated patients. 
In patients aged 2 to less than 6 years the most common adverse reactions were nasal congestion 
(26.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (23.5%), transaminase elevations (14.7%), rash (11.8%), and 
bacteria in sputum (11.8%). 
Serious adverse reactions included abdominal pain (0.9%) and transaminase elevations (1.8%) in 
patients who received ivacaftor, while serious adverse reactions of rash were reported in 1.5% patients 
aged 12 years and older treated with a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (see 
section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Transaminase elevations 
During the 48-week placebo-controlled studies 1 and 2 in patients aged 6 years and older, the 
incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) > 8, > 5 or > 3 × ULN was 3.7%, 3.7% and 8.3% 
in ivacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.9% and 8.7% in placebo-treated patients, respectively. Two 
patients, one on placebo and one on ivacaftor, permanently discontinued treatment for elevated 
transaminases, each > 8 × ULN. No ivacaftor-treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation 
> 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN. In ivacaftor-treated patients, most 
transaminase elevations up to 5 × ULN resolved without treatment interruption. Ivacaftor dosing was 
interrupted in most patients with transaminase elevations > 5 × ULN. In all instances where dosing 
was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, ivacaftor dosing was able to be 
resumed successfully (see section 4.4). 
During the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (up to 24 weeks) of tezacaftor/ivacaftor, the incidence of 
maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) > 8, > 5, or > 3 × ULN were 0.2%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor treated patients, and 0.4%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in placebo-treated patients. One patient 
(0.2%) on therapy and 2 patients (0.4%) on placebo permanently discontinued treatment for elevated 
transaminases. No patients treated with tezacaftor/ivacaftor experienced a transaminase elevation > 3 × 
ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin > 2 × ULN.  
During the 24-week, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, these 
figures were 1.5%, 2.5%, and 7.9% in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.5%, 
and 5.5% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations 
was 10.9% in ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor treated patients 
and 4.0% in placebo-treated patients. 
Post-marketing cases of treatment discontinuation due to elevated transaminases have been reported 
with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (see section 4.4). 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rash events 
Rash events, generally mild to moderate in severity, have been observed with the use of ivacaftor in a 
combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor and occurred more frequently in female-
treated patients (16.3%) and in those taking hormonal contraceptives (20.5%) (see section 4.4). 
Increased creatine phosphokinase 
Generally transient and asymptomatic increases in creatine phosphokinase were observed in patients 
treated with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, which did not 
lead to treatment discontinuation. 
Increased blood pressure 
An increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 3.5 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, 
respectively was observed in patients treated with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. 
Paediatric population 
The safety data of ivacaftor were evaluated in 6 patients between 4 months to less than 6 months of 
age, 11 patients between 6 months to less than 12 months of age, 19 patients between 12 months to 
less than 24 months of age, 34 patients between 2 to less than 6 years of age, 61 patients between 6 to 
less than 12 years of age and 94 patients between 12 to less than 18 years of age. 
The safety profile is generally consistent among paediatric patients aged 4 months and older and is 
also consistent with adult patients. 
The incidence of transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) observed in studies 2, 5 and 6 (patients aged 6 
to less than 12 years), study 7 (patients aged 2 to less than 6 years), and study 8 (patients aged 4 to less 
than 24 months) are described in Table 5. In the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of 
transaminase elevations were similar between treatment with ivacaftor (15.0%) and placebo (14.6%). 
Peak LFT elevations were generally higher in paediatric patients than in older patients. Across all 
populations, peak LFT elevations returned to baseline levels following interruption, and in almost all 
instances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, 
ivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4). Cases suggestive of positive 
rechallenge were observed. In study 7 ivacaftor was permanently discontinued in one patient. In 
study 8 no patients had elevations in total bilirubin or discontinued ivacaftor treatment due to 
transaminase elevations in either age cohort (see section 4.4 for management of elevated 
transaminases).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX02 
Mechanism of action 
Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein, i.e., in vitro ivacaftor increases CFTR channel gating to 
enhance chloride transport in specified gating mutations (as listed in section 4.1) with reduced 
channel-open probability compared to normal CFTR. Ivacaftor also potentiated the channel-open 
probability of R117H-CFTR, which has both low channel-open probability (gating) and reduced 
channel current amplitude (conductance). The G970R mutation causes a splicing defect resulting in 
little-to-no CFTR protein at the cell surface which may explain the results observed in subjects with 
this mutation in study 5 (see Pharmacodynamic effects and Clinical efficacy and safety).  
In vitro responses seen in single channel patch clamp experiments using membrane patches from 
rodent cells expressing mutant CFTR forms do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic 
response (e.g., sweat chloride) or clinical benefit. The exact mechanism leading ivacaftor to potentiate 
the gating activity of normal and some mutant CFTR forms in this system has not been completely 
elucidated. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Ivacaftor as monotherapy 
In studies 1 and 2 in patients with the G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene, ivacaftor led to 
rapid (15 days), substantial (the mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 
was -48 mmol/L [95% CI -51, -45] and -54 mmol/L [95% CI -62, -47], respectively) and sustained 
(through 48 weeks) reductions in sweat chloride concentration. 
In study 5, part 1 in patients who had a non-G551D gating mutation in the CFTR gene, treatment with 
ivacaftor led to a rapid (15 days) and substantial mean change from baseline in sweat chloride 
of -49 mmol/L (95% CI -57, -41) through 8 weeks of treatment. However, in patients with the 
G970R-CFTR mutation, the mean (SD) absolute change in sweat chloride at week 8 was -6.25 
(6.55) mmol/L. Similar results to part 1 were seen in part 2 of the study. At the 4-week follow-up visit 
(4 weeks after dosing with ivacaftor ended), mean sweat chloride values for each group were trending 
to pre-treatment levels. 
In study 6 in patients aged 6 years or older with CF who had an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene, 
the treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through 24 weeks of 
treatment was -24 mmol/L (95% CI -28, -20). In subgroup analyses by age, the treatment difference 
was -21.87 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.46, -17.28) in patients aged 18 years or older, and -27.63 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -37.16, -18.10) in patients aged 6 to 11 years. Two patients 12 to 17 years of age were 
enrolled in this study. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study 7 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with a gating mutation on at least 1 allele of the CFTR 
gene administered either 50 mg or 75 mg of ivacaftor twice daily, the mean absolute change from 
baseline in sweat chloride was -47 mmol/L (95% CI -58, -36) at week 24. 
In study 8 in patients with CF aged less than 24 months, the mean absolute change from baseline in 
sweat chloride was -65.1 mmol/L (95% CI -74.1, -56.0) at week 24. Results were consistent in the 
12 months to less than 24 months, 6 months to less than 12 months, and 4 months to less than 
6 months age cohorts. 
Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor 
In patients with an F508del mutation on one allele and a mutation on the second allele that predicts 
either no production of a CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that does not transport chloride and is not 
responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor (minimal function mutation) in vitro, the treatment 
difference of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor compared to placebo for mean absolute change in sweat 
chloride from baseline through week 24 was -41.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.4, -39.3). 
In patients homozygous for the F508del mutation, the treatment difference of 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor compared to tezacaftor/ivacaftor for mean absolute change in sweat 
chloride from baseline at week 4 was -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -50.1, -40.1). 
In patients heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele with a gating 
defect or residual CFTR activity, the treatment difference of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor compared 
to the control group (ivacaftor monotherapy group plus tezacaftor/ivacaftor group) for mean absolute 
change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 8 was -23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.1, -20.1). 
In patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the 
F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation, the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from 
baseline (n=62) through week 24 (n=60) was -60.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2)*. The mean 
absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 12 (n=59) was -58.6 mmol/L (95% CI: 
-61.1, -56.1). 
* Not all participants included in the analyses had data available for all follow-up visits, especially 
from week 16 onwards. The ability to collect data at week 24 was hampered by the COVID-19 
pandemic. Week 12 data were less impacted by the pandemic. 
In patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function 
mutation, treatment with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in combination with ivacaftor resulted in 
reduction in sweat chloride through week 24, as compared to placebo. The treatment difference of 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor compared to placebo for mean absolute change in sweat chloride from 
baseline through week 24 was -51.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -55.3, -47.1; nominal P < 0.0001). 
In patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous 
for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation, the mean absolute change in sweat chloride 
from baseline through Week 24 was -57.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.3, -54.6). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Ivacaftor as monotherapy 
Studies 1 and 2: studies in patients with CF with G551D gating mutations 
The efficacy of ivacaftor has been evaluated in two phase 3 randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multi-centre studies of clinically stable patients with CF who had the G551D 
mutation in the CFTR gene on at least 1 allele and had FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients in both studies were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every 
12 hours with food containing fat for 48 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies (e.g., 
tobramycin, dornase alfa). The use of inhaled hypertonic sodium chloride was not permitted. 
Study 1 evaluated 161 patients who were 12 years of age or older; 122 (75.8%) patients had the 
F508del mutation in the second allele. At the start of the study, patients in the placebo group used 
some medicinal products at a higher frequency than the ivacaftor group. These medicinal products 
included dornase alfa (73.1% versus 65.1%), salbutamol (53.8% versus 42.2%), tobramycin (44.9% 
versus 33.7%) and salmeterol/fluticasone (41.0% versus 27.7%). At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 
was 63.6% (range: 31.6% to 98.2%) and mean age was 26 years (range: 12 to 53 years). 
Study 2 evaluated 52 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age at screening; mean (SD) body weight was 
30.9 (8.63) kg; 42 (80.8%) patients had the F508del mutation in the second allele. At baseline, mean 
predicted FEV1 was 84.2% (range: 44.0% to 133.8%) and mean age was 9 years (range: 6 to 12 years); 
8 (30.8%) patients in the placebo group and 4 (15.4%) patients in the ivacaftor group had an FEV1 less 
than 70% predicted at baseline. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the mean absolute change from baseline in percent 
predicted FEV1 through 24 weeks of treatment. 
The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in 
percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 was 10.6 percentage points (8.6, 12.6) in 
study 1 and 12.5 percentage points (6.6, 18.3) in study 2. The treatment difference between ivacaftor 
and placebo for the mean relative change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through 
week 24 was 17.1% (13.9, 20.2) in study 1 and 15.8% (8.4, 23.2) in study 2. The mean change from 
baseline through week 24 in FEV1 (L) was 0.37 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.01 L in the placebo 
group in study 1 and 0.30 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.07 L in the placebo group in study 2. In both 
studies, improvements in FEV1 were rapid in onset (day 15) and durable through 48 weeks. 
The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in 
percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients 12 to 17 years of age in study 1 was 
11.9 percentage points (5.9, 17.9). The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the 
mean absolute change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients 
with baseline predicted FEV1 greater than 90% in study 2 was 6.9 percentage points (-3.8, 17.6). 
The results for clinically relevant secondary endpoints are shown in Table 6.

Study 5: study in patients with CF with non-G551D gating mutations 
Study 5 was a phase 3, two-part, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study 
(part 1) followed by a 16-week open-label extension period (part 2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 years and older who have a G970R or non-G551D gating 
mutation in the CFTR gene (G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P or G1349D). 
In part 1, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every 12 hours 
with fat-containing food for 8 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies and crossed over to 
the other treatment for the second 8 weeks after a 4- to 8-week washout period. The use of inhaled 
hypertonic saline was not permitted. In part 2, all patients received ivacaftor as indicated in part 1 for 
16 additional weeks. The duration of continuous ivacaftor treatment was 24 weeks for patients 
randomised to the part 1 placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence and 16 weeks for patients randomised to 
part 1 ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence. 
Thirty-nine patients (mean age 23 years) with baseline FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted (mean FEV1 78% 
predicted [range: 43% to 119%]) were enrolled. Sixty-two percent (24/39) of them carried the 
F508del-CFTR mutation in the second allele. A total of 36 patients continued into part 2 (18 per 
treatment sequence). 
In part 1 of study 5, the mean FEV1 percent predicted at baseline in placebo-treated patients was 
79.3% while in ivacaftor-treated patients this value was 76.4%. The mean overall post-baseline value 
was 76.0% and 83.7%, respectively. The mean absolute change from baseline through week 8 in 
percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 7.5% in the ivacaftor period and -3.2% in the 
placebo period. The observed treatment difference (95% CI) between ivacaftor and placebo was 10.7% 
(7.3, 14.1) (P < 0.0001). 
The effect of ivacaftor in the overall population of study 5 (including the secondary endpoints absolute 
change in BMI at 8 weeks of treatment and absolute change in the respiratory domain score of the 
CFQ-R through 8 weeks of treatment) and by individual mutation (absolute change in sweat chloride 
and in percent predicted FEV1 at week 8) is shown in Table 7. Based on clinical (percent predicted 
FEV1) and pharmacodynamic (sweat chloride) responses to ivacaftor, efficacy in patients with the 
G970R mutation could not be established.

In part 2 of study 5, the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 following 16 weeks 
(patients randomised to the ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence in part 1) of continuous ivacaftor 
treatment was 10.4% (13.2%). At the follow-up visit 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the 
mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2 week 16 was -5.9% (9.4%). For 
patients randomised to the placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence in part 1 there was a further mean 
(SD) change of 3.3% (9.3%) in percent predicted FEV1 after the additional 16 weeks of treatment with 
ivacaftor. At the follow up visit 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the mean (SD) absolute 
change in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2, week 16 was -7.4% (5.5%). 
Study 3: study in patients with CF with the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene 
Study 3 (part A) was a 16-week, 4:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
phase 2 study of ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 hours) in 140 patients with CF age 12 years and older 
who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene and who had FEV1 ≥ 40% 
predicted. 
The mean absolute change from baseline through week 16 in percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy 
endpoint) was 1.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and -0.2 percentage points in the placebo 
group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 1.7 percentage points (95% 
CI -0.6, 4.1); this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). 
Study 4: open-label extension study 
In study 4, patients who completed treatment in studies 1 and 2 with placebo were switched to 
ivacaftor while patients on ivacaftor continued to receive it for a minimum of 96 weeks, i.e., the length 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of treatment with ivacaftor was at least 96 weeks for patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group and at 
least 144 weeks for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. 
One hundred and forty-four (144) patients from study 1 were rolled over in study 4, 67 in the 
placebo/ivacaftor group and 77 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Forty-eight (48) patients from study 2 
were rolled over in study 4, 22 in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 26 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. 
Table 8 shows the results of the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 for both groups 
of patients. For patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group baseline percent predicted FEV1 is that of 
study 4 while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group the baseline value is that of studies 1 and 2.

When the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 is compared from study 4 baseline for 
patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n = 72) who rolled over from study 1, the mean (SD) absolute 
change in percent predicted FEV1 was 0.0% (9.05), while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group 
(n = 25) who rolled over from study 2 this figure was 0.6% (9.1). This shows that patients in the 
ivacaftor/ivacaftor group maintained the improvement seen at week 48 of the initial study (day 0 
through week 48) in percent predicted FEV1 through week 144. There were no additional 
improvements in study 4 (week 48 through week 144). 
For patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group from study 1, the annualised rate of pulmonary 
exacerbations was higher in the initial study when patients were on placebo (1.34 events/year) than 
during the subsequent study 4 when patients rolled over to ivacaftor (0.48 events/year across day 1 to 
week 48, and 0.67 events/year across weeks 48 to 96). For patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group 
from study 1, the annualised rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 0.57 events/year across day 1 to 
week 48 when patients were on ivacaftor. When they rolled over into study 4, the rate of annualised 
pulmonary exacerbations was 0.91 events/year across day 1 to week 48 and 0.77 events/year across 
weeks 48 to 96. 
For patients who rolled over from study 2 the number of events was, overall, low. 
Study 6: study in patients with CF with an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene 
Study 6 evaluated 69 patients who were 6 years of age or older; 53 (76.8%) patients had the F508del 
mutation in the second allele. The confirmed R117H poly-T variant was 5T in 38 patients and 7T in 
16 patients. At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was 73% (range: 32.5% to 105.5%) and mean age was 
31 years (range: 6 to 68 years). The mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent 
predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 2.57 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus 
placebo was 2.1 percentage points (95% CI -1.1, 5.4). 
A pre-planned subgroup analysis was conducted in patients aged 18 years and older (26 patients on 
placebo and 24 patients on ivacaftor). Treatment with ivacaftor resulted in a mean absolute change in 
percent predicted FEV1 through week 24 of 4.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group 
versus -0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor 
versus placebo was 5.0 percentage points (95% CI 1.1, 8.8). 
In a subgroup analysis in patients with a confirmed R117H-5T genetic variant, the difference in the 
mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent predicted FEV1 between ivacaftor and 
placebo was 5.3% (95% CI 1.3, 9.3). In patients with a confirmed R117H-7T genetic variant, the 
treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo was 0.2% (95% CI -8.1, 8.5). 
For secondary efficacy variables, no treatment differences were observed for ivacaftor versus placebo 
in absolute change from baseline in BMI at week 24 or time to first pulmonary exacerbation. 
Treatment differences were observed in absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score through 
week 24 (treatment difference of ivacaftor versus placebo was 8.4 [95% CI 2.2, 14.6] points) and for 
the mean change from baseline in sweat chloride (see Pharmacodynamic effects). 
Study 7: study in paediatric patients with CF aged 2 to less than 6 years with G551D or another 
gating mutation 
The pharmacokinetic profile, safety and efficacy of ivacaftor in 34 patients aged 2 to less than 6 years 
with CF who had a G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R 
mutation in the CFTR gene were assessed in a 24-week uncontrolled study with ivacaftor (patients 
weighing less than 14 kg received ivacaftor 50 mg and patients weighing 14 kg or more received 
ivacaftor 75 mg). Ivacaftor was administered orally every 12 hours with fat-containing food in addition 
to their prescribed CF therapies. 
Patients in study 7 were aged 2 to less than 6 years (mean age 3 years). Twenty-six patients out of the 
34 enrolled (76.5%) had a CFTR genotype G551D/F508del with only 2 patients with a non-G551D 
mutation (S549N). The mean (SD) sweat chloride at baseline (n = 25) was 97.88 mmol/L (14.00). The 
mean (SD) faecal elastase-1 value at baseline (n = 27) was 28 µg/g (95). 
The primary endpoint of safety was evaluated through week 24 (see section 4.8). Secondary and 
exploratory efficacy endpoints evaluated were absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride 
through 24 weeks of treatment, absolute change from baseline in weight, body mass index (BMI) and 
stature (supported by weight, BMI and stature z-scores) at 24 weeks of treatment, and measures of 
pancreatic function such as faecal elastase-1. Data on percent predicted FEV1 (exploratory endpoint) 
were available for 3 patients in the ivacaftor 50 mg group and 17 patients in the 75 mg dosing group. 
The mean (SD) overall (both ivacaftor dosing groups combined) absolute change from baseline in 
BMI at week 24 was 0.32 kg/m2 (0.54) and the mean (SD) overall change in BMI-for-age z-score was 
0.37 (0.42). The mean (SD) overall change in stature-for-age z-score was -0.01 (0.33). The mean (SD) 
overall change from baseline in faecal elastase-1 (n = 27) was 99.8 µg/g (138.4). Six patients with 
initial levels below 200 µg/g achieved, at week 24, a level of ≥ 200 µg/g. The mean (SD) overall 
change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline at week 24 (exploratory endpoint) was 1.8 (17.81). 
Study 8: study in paediatric patients with CF aged less than 24 months 
The pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and efficacy of ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 4 months to 
less than 24 months were assessed in a completed cohort of patients in an on-going 24-week, 
open-label, phase 3 clinical study in patients aged less than 24 months (study 8). 
Part B of study 8 enrolled 19 patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months (mean age 15.2 months at 
baseline), with 18 patients completing the 24-week treatment period, 11 patients aged 6 months to less 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than 12 months (mean age 9.0 months at baseline) with all 11 patients completing the 24-week 
treatment period, and 6 patients aged 4 months to less than 6 months (mean age 4.5 months at 
baseline) with all 6 patients completing the 24-week treatment period. Patients received ivacaftor 
25 mg, 50 mg or 75 mg according to their age and weight at each study visit (see section 4.2). 
Ivacaftor was administered orally every 12 hours with fat-containing food. Patients continued on their 
prescribed standard-of-care CF therapies. 
In part B of study 8 the primary endpoint of safety was evaluated through 24 weeks (see section 4.8). 
Secondary endpoints were evaluation of pharmacokinetics and the absolute change from baseline in 
sweat chloride through 24 weeks of treatment (see Pharmacodynamic effects). Tertiary endpoints 
included efficacy measures such as faecal elastase-1 and growth parameters. 
For patients aged 4 months to less than 24 months, with both baseline and week 24 values available, 
mean (SD) weight-for-age, length-for-age, and weight-for-length z-scores are provided in Table 9.

In patients aged 4 months to less than 24 months, with both baseline and week 24 values available, 18 
patients were pancreatic insufficient at baseline (defined as faecal elastase-1 < 200 µg/g) with mean 
(SD) faecal elastase-1 values at baseline and week 24 of 25.5 µg/g (27.6) and 253.6 µg/g (128.3), 
respectively (mean [SD] absolute change 228.41 µg/g [128.3]). Results were consistent in the 
12 months to less than 24 months, 6 months to less than 12 months, and 4 months to less than 6 
months age cohorts. 
Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor 
The efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in 
patients aged 12 years and older was demonstrated in three phase 3, randomised, double blind, 
placebo-controlled (patients were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation with minimal 
function on the second allele, n = 403) and active-controlled (patients were homozygous for the 
F508del mutation, n = 107, or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a gating or residual CFTR 
activity mutation on the second allele, n = 258) studies of 24, 4, and 8 weeks of duration respectively. 
Patients from all studies were eligible to enter open label, rollover, long-term extension studies. Refer 
to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor for additional data. 
Paediatric population 
Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor 
The pharmacokinetics and safety in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (n = 66) and in those from 2 
to less than 6 years (n = 75) who have at least one F508del mutation were assessed in two 24-week 
open-label studies. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with

information on paediatric use). 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF. 
After oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) 
for AUC and Cmax were 10600 (5260) ng*hr/mL and 768 (233) ng/mL, respectively. After every 
12-hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ivacaftor were reached by days 3 to 5, with an 
accumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9. 
Absorption 
Following multiple oral dose administrations of ivacaftor, the exposure of ivacaftor generally 
increased with dose from 25 mg every 12 hours to 450 mg every 12 hours. When given with fat-
containing food the exposure of ivacaftor increased approximately 2.5- to 4-fold. When co-
administered with tezacaftor and elexacaftor, the increase in AUC was similar (approximately 3-fold 
and 2.5-to 4-fold respectively). Therefore, ivacaftor, administered as monotherapy or in a combination 
regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, should be administered with fat-containing food. The 
median (range) tmax is approximately 4.0 (3.0; 6.0) hours in the fed state. 
Ivacaftor granules (2 × 75 mg sachets) had similar bioavailability as the 150 mg tablet when given 
with fat-containing food to healthy adult subjects. The geometric least squares mean ratio (90% CI) for 
the granules relative to tablets was 0.951 (0.839, 1.08) for AUC0-∞ and 0.918 (0.750, 1.12) for Cmax. 
The effect of food on ivacaftor absorption is similar for both formulations, i.e., tablets and granules. 
Distribution 
Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and 
albumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells. After oral administration of ivacaftor 
150 mg every 12 hours for 7 days in healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) apparent 
volume of distribution was 353 L (122). 
Biotransformation 
Ivacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is 
primarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. 
M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. 
M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. 
The effect of the CYP3A4*22 heterozygous genotype on ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor 
exposure is consistent with the effect of co-administration of a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is not 
clinically relevant. No dose adjustment of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, or elexacaftor is considered necessary. 
The effect in CYP3A4*22 homozygous genotype patients is expected to be stronger. However, no data 
are available for such patients. 
Elimination 
Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) was eliminated 
in the faeces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for 
approximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible 
urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately 
12 hours following a single dose in the fed state. The apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The mean (±SD) CL/F for a single 150 mg dose was 
17.3 (8.4) L/hr in healthy subjects. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are generally linear with respect to time or dose ranging from 
25 mg to 250 mg. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Following a single dose of 150 mg of ivacaftor, adult subjects with moderately impaired hepatic 
function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had similar ivacaftor Cmax (mean [± SD] of 
735 [331] ng/mL) but an approximately two-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC0-∞ (mean [± SD] of 16800 
[6140] ng*hr/mL) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Simulations for 
predicting the steady-state exposure of ivacaftor showed that by reducing the dose from 150 mg q12h 
to 150 mg once daily, adults with moderate hepatic impairment would have comparable steady-state 
Cmin values as those obtained with a dose of 150 mg q12h in adults without hepatic impairment.  
In subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9), ivacaftor 
AUC increased approximately by 50% following multiple doses for 10 days of ivacaftor, tezacaftor 
and elexacaftor. 
The impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C, score 10 to15) on the pharmacokinetics 
of ivacaftor or in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor have not been studied. 
The magnitude of increase in exposure in these patients is unknown but is expected to be higher than 
that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  
For guidance on appropriate use and dose modification see Table 3 in section 4.2.  
Renal impairment 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with ivacaftor in patients with renal impairment. In 
a human pharmacokinetic study, there was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in 
urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine). There was negligible urinary 
excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent (less than 0.01% following a single oral dose of 500 mg).  
No dose adjustments are recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment. However, caution is 
recommended when administering ivacaftor to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Race 
Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of ivacaftor in white (n = 379) and non-white 
(n = 29) patients based on a population PK analysis. 
Gender 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor are similar in males and females. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
Clinical studies of ivacaftor as monotherapy did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 
65 years and older to determine whether pharmacokinetic parameters are similar or not to those in 
younger adults. 
Paediatric population 
Predicted ivacaftor exposure based on observed ivacaftor concentrations in phase 2 and 3 studies as 
determined using population PK analysis is presented by age group in Table 10.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. 
Pregnancy and fertility 
Ivacaftor was associated with slight decreases of the seminal vesicle weights, a decrease of overall 
fertility index and number of pregnancies in females mated with treated males and significant 
reductions in number of corpora lutea and implantation sites with subsequent reductions in the average 
litter size and average number of viable embryos per litter in treated females. The 
No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings provides an exposure level of 
approximately 4 times the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as 
ivacaftor monotherapy in adult humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). 
Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. 
Peri- and post-natal development 
Ivacaftor decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in pup body weights. The 
NOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level approximately 3 times the 
systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy in 
adult humans at the MRHD.  
Juvenile animals studies 
Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through 35 at ivacaftor 
exposure levels of 0.22 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites 
when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy. This finding has not been observed in foetuses derived 
from rat dams treated with ivacaftor on gestation days 7 to 17, in rat pups exposed to ivacaftor through 
milk ingestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week old rats, nor in 3.5 to 5-month old dogs treated with 
ivacaftor. The potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Kalydeco is and what it is used for 
Kalydeco contains the active substance ivacaftor. Ivacaftor acts at the level of the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a protein that forms a channel at the cell surface that 
allows the movement of particles such as chloride in and out of the cell. Due to mutations in the CFTR 
gene (see below), chloride movement is reduced in those with cystic fibrosis (CF). Ivacaftor helps 
certain abnormal CFTR proteins open more often to improve chloride movement in and out of the cell. 
Kalydeco tablets are indicated:  
• 
As monotherapy for patients aged 6 years and older and weighing 25 kg or more with cystic 
fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H CFTR mutation or one of the following gating mutations in 
the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R. 
• 
• 
In combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets for patients aged 6 years and older with CF who 
have two F508del mutations in the CFTR gene (homozygous for the F508del mutation) or who 
have an F508del mutation and certain other second mutations that result in reduced amount 
and/or function of the CFTR protein (heterozygous for the F508del mutation with a residual 
function (RF) mutation). If you have been prescribed Kalydeco to be taken with 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor, read the package leaflet of the latter. It contains important information 
about how to take these two medicines. 
In combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets for patients aged 6 years and over 
who have CF, with at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. If you have been prescribed 
Kalydeco to be taken with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, read the package leaflet of the latter. 
It contains important information about how to take these two medicines.

2.  What you need to know before you take Kalydeco 
Do not take Kalydeco 
• 
if you are allergic to ivacaftor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kalydeco. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor if you have liver problems or have previously had them. Your doctor may 
need to adjust your dose. 
Increased liver enzymes in the blood have been seen in some people receiving Kalydeco (alone 
or in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor). Tell your doctor 
right away if you have any of these symptoms, which may be a sign of liver problems: 
•  Pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area 
•  Yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes 
•  Loss of appetite 
•  Nausea or vomiting 
•  Dark urine 
Your doctor will do some blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment, 
particularly during the first year and especially if your blood tests showed high liver enzymes in 
the past. 
Depression (including suicidal thoughts and behaviours) has been reported in patients while 
taking Kalydeco, mainly in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, usually starting within the first three months of treatment. Talk 
to a doctor straightaway if you (or someone taking this medicine) experience any of the 
following symptoms: sad or altered mood, anxiety, feelings of emotional discomfort or thoughts 
of harming or killing yourself, which may be signs of depression. 
Talk to your doctor if you have kidney problems or have previously had them. 
Kalydeco  is not recommended if you have undergone an organ transplant. 
Talk to your doctor if you are using hormonal contraception – for example, women using the 
contraceptive pill. This may mean you are more likely to get a rash while taking Kalydeco in 
combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. 
Abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) without any effect on vision has been noted in some 
children and adolescents treated with Kalydeco (alone or in combination with 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor). Your doctor may perform some eye 
examinations prior to and during treatment. 
Kalydeco  should only be used if you have one of the mutations in the CFTR gene indicated in 
section 1 (What Kalydeco is and what it is used for). 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under 4 months of age as it is not known if ivacaftor is safe and 
effective in these children. 
105 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not give this medicine in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor to children under 6 years of age or 
in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor to children under 2 years of age as it is not known 
if they are safe and effective for them. 
Other medicines and Kalydeco 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Some medicines can affect how Kalydeco works or make side effects more likely. In particular, tell 
your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. Your doctor may decide to adjust your 
dose or that you need extra check-ups. 
•  Antifungal medicines (used for the treatment of fungal infections). These include fluconazole, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. 
•  Antibiotic medicines (used for the treatment of bacterial infections). These include 
clarithromycin, erythromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin, and telithromycin. 
•  Epilepsy medicines (used for the treatment of epileptic seizures or fits). These include 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.  
•  Herbal medicines. These include St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). 
• 
Immunosuppressants (used after an organ transplantation). These include ciclosporin, 
everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus.  
•  Cardiac glycosides (used for the treatment of some heart conditions). These include digoxin. 
•  Anticoagulant medicines (used to prevent blood clots). These include warfarin.  
•  Medicines for diabetes. These include glimepiride and glipizide.  
•  Medicines for lowering blood pressure. These include verapamil. 
Kalydeco with food and drink 
Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit during treatment as these may increase the side effects of 
Kalydeco by increasing the amount of ivacaftor in your body. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. It may be better to avoid using Kalydeco during 
pregnancy, if possible, and your doctor will help you decide what is best for you and your child. 
Ivacaftor passes into breast milk. If you plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for advice before taking 
Kalydeco. Your doctor will decide whether to recommend that you stop breast-feeding or for you to 
stop ivacaftor therapy. Your doctor will take into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child 
and the benefit of therapy for you. 
Driving and using machines 
Kalydeco can make you dizzy. If you feel dizzy, do not drive, cycle or use machines. 
Kalydeco contains lactose and sodium.  
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
Kalydeco contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ivacaftor, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
In  view  of  available  data  on  risk  of  occurrence  of  depression  and  related  events  from  spontaneous 
reports  in  post-marketing  surveillance,  including  in some  cases  a  close  temporal  relationship  and  a 
positive de-challenge and re-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between Ivacaftor 
and depression is at least a reasonable possibility, mainly when used in a combination treatment with 
TEZ/IVA or IVA/TEZ/ELX. The PRAC concluded that the product information of medicinal products 
containing Ivacaftor should be amended accordingly.  
In view of available data on breast-feeding from the literature, update of section 4.6 of the SmPC is 
warranted  regarding  breast-feeding.  The  PRAC  concluded  that the  product  information  of products 
containing Ivacaftor should be amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions 
and grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ivacaftor the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ivacaftor is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

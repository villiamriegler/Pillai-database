CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE 
OF MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES 
The Member States should ensure that all conditions or restrictions with regard to the 
safe and effective use of the medicinal product described below are implemented: 
Gliolan should be used only by neurosurgeons who have attended a training course in accordance with 
the standards detailed below:  
The Member States shall agree with the Marketing Authorisation Holder, prior to launch, measures for 
the implementation of the following: 
âˆ’  A training course for neurosurgeons which is aimed at risk minimisation and to support safe and 
effective use for the product. The training course will take place at qualified training centres using 
qualified trainers.  This course shall consist of measures aiming to minimise adverse events 
associated with the Gliolan-fluorescence-guided surgery (in particular neurological serious 
adverse events) through adequate education about: 
a)  Theory and core principles of Gliolan-fluorescence-guided surgery and malignant glioma 
resection, including methods of eloquent sites identification;  
b)  On-site instructions on the use of the fluorescence-microscope, including pitfalls and 
recognition of problems;  
c)  Differentiation of fluorescence intensity, maintaining safety distances from eloquent areas, 
etc.  
d)  The practice of Gliolan-fluorescence-guided surgery (including participation in at least one 
cases using Gliolan-fluorescence-guided surgery in the operating room with on-site 
instructions on the use of the microscope or demonstration of a fluorescence-guided resection 
by video);  
e)  The current understanding of the benefits and risks of cytoreductive surgery in the 
management of patients with malignant gliomas;  
f)  The theoretical base for porphyrin accumulation in malignant gliomas;  
g)  The technical principles behind fluorescence-guided resections using Gliolan;  
h)  How to identify suitable candidates for fluorescence-guided resections using Gliolan;  
i)  How to apply Gliolan in the correct dosage and timing regimen, and to understand the 
importance of concurrent corticosteroids;  
j)  How to identify patients at risk for neurological deficits using fluorescence-guided resections 
with Gliolan with special focus on aphasias and other critical focal deficits;  
k)  Techniques for intraoperative risk reduction (microsurgical technique, neurophysiological 
monitoring, choice of approach) and how to implement them;  
l)  How to identify fluorescence for resection through using the operating microscope in a hands-
on setting in the operating room;  
m)  The benefits and risks of fluorescence-guided resections using Gliolan;  
Minimum requirements for a qualified trainer are:  
- Board-certification as neurosurgeon according to local, national requirements;  
- Previous successful participation at a training course, or equivalent course during the phase 
III trial;  
- Experience with Gliolan-fluorescence-guided surgery in at least 20 cases.  
Minimum requirements for a qualified training centre are:  
- Microscope modified for fluorescence-guided resection;  
- Sufficient case load (at least 10 patients per year) of malignant gliomas (WHO grade III and 
IV);  
- Neurophysiological monitoring techniques for surgery in eloquent brain regions.

1.  Introduction 
On August 20, 2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Gardasil 9, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that V503-P017 A Phase III Open-label Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Gardasil 9 
Administered to 9- to 26- Year-Old Females and Males in Vietnam is a standalone study. 
Gardasil 9 (9vHPV) was licensed in the EU at 2015.  
The 9vHPV vaccine was developed to provide protection against infection and disease caused by 7 
cancer-causing HPV types (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58), which are together responsible for 
approximately 90% of cervical cancers and HPV-related vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers, and 2 HPV 
types (HPV 6 and 11) which are responsible for 90% of genital warts worldwide.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The commercially available formulation of Gardasil 9 (also known as 9vHPV vaccine or V503), batch 
number: R003279, was used in the study. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

Methods 
Objectives and endpoints 
Protocol V503-017 was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the 9-valent Human 
Papillomavirus (9vHPV) [Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58] L1 Virus-Like Particle (VLP) 
Recombinant Vaccine (hereafter referred to as the 9vHPV vaccine) in males and females of 9 to 26 
years in Vietnam. 
Table 1.  Objectives and endpoints of the study 
Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The purpose of the HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 Competitive Luminex Immunoassay 
(cLIA) or HPV-9 cLIA is to measure antibodies to HPV VLP types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 
before and after vaccination with the 9vHPV vaccine. This assay was performed by Q2 Solutions 
Vaccines (San Juan Capistrano, California, USA) to evaluate the serological response following 
vaccination.  
The primary immunogenicity endpoints are the seroconversion percentages to each of HPV 6, 11, 16, 
18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 by 4 weeks post Dose 3. Seroconversion is defined as changing a 
participant’s serostatus from seronegative at Day 1 to seropositive by 4 weeks post Dose 3. A 
EMA/644999/2019

participant with anti-HPV cLIA (competitive Luminex immunoassay) titre at or above the serostatus 
cut-off for a given HPV type is considered seropositive for that HPV type.  
The serostatus cut-off is the antibody titre level within the assay’s quantifiable range that reliably 
distinguishes “negative” from “positive” samples. The quantifiable range of the assay is the range of 
the standard curve over which test sample results had acceptable precision. To determine the 
serostatus cut off, a bridging study was performed to compare reportable results from the Q2 version of 
the HPV-9 cLIA to historical results generated using the previous version of the assay. The serostatus 
cut-offs for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 are 50, 29, 41, 59, 29, 22, 15, 20, and 15 
mMU/mL, respectively. 
The secondary immunogenicity endpoints are GMTs to HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 at 4 
weeks post Dose 3. 
Study design 
Protocol V503-017 was an open-label, single-centre and single-group assignment study to evaluate the 
immunogenicity and safety of the 9vHPV vaccine in 9 to 26-year-old females and males in Vietnam. 
Figure 1.  Study design 
Study population /Sample size 
Approximately 200 healthy participants were planned to be enrolled. Enrolment was stratified by age 
and gender according to the following factors: 
•  Age: 1:1 allocation between 9 to 15 and 16 to 26-year-old age strata. 
•  Gender: 2:1 allocation between females and males within each of the 9 to 15 and 16 to 26-
year-old age strata. 
Additionally, enrolment limits were applied in the 9 to 15 years age group to ensure ≥30% enrolment 
into each of the following 2 age subgroups (with a minimum number of female and male participants in 
each age subgroup): 9 to 12 years and 13 to 15 years (at least 20 female and 10 male participants in 
each age subgroup).

Treatments 
Participants were to receive a 3-dose regimen (Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6) of the 9vHPV vaccine. 
9vHPV vaccine (0.5 mL) was administered as an intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the 
non-dominant arm. Serum samples for measurement of anti-HPV antibodies were collected on Day 1 
and Month 7 or approximately 4 weeks after administration of Dose 3. The safety of the vaccine was 
evaluated in all participants who received at least one dose of vaccine and provided safety data at any 
time during the study. Safety information was collected from Day 1 through Month 7. 
Statistical Methods 
Immunogenicity Analyses 
The Per-Protocol Immunogenicity (PPI) population served as the primary population for the analysis of 
immune response to each of the HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 in this study. The PPI 
population was HPV type-specific and consisted of all allocated participants who: 
•  Were seronegative to the appropriate HPV type at Day 1; 
•  Received all 3 vaccinations with the correct dose of 9vHPV vaccine within acceptable day 
ranges as specified in the protocol; 
• 
Provided serum a sample within 21 to 49 days post-dose 3; 
•  Had no protocol deviations that could interfere with the evaluation of participant’s immune 
response to 9vHPV vaccination. At Day 1, participants 9 to 15 years of age had to satisfy 
Inclusion Criterion 4 (i.e., “Had not yet had coitarche and did not plan on becoming sexually 
active during the vaccination period [Day 1 through Month 7]”). 
The primary immunogenicity hypothesis was addressed by calculating point and 95% CI estimates of 
percent seroconversion. The 95% CI estimate was derived based on exact binomial calculations. The 
statistical criterion for acceptable anti-HPV seroconversion required the lower limit of the 95% CI of the 
percent of participants who seroconverted to be greater than 90% for each HPV type. 
The corresponding tests of hypothesis for each of these HPV types were conducted at 1-sided Type I 
error level of 0.025. No adjustment for multiplicity was required since success was required for all of 
the 9 HPV types tested. 
The secondary immunogenicity objective was addressed by calculating point and 95% CI estimates of 
GMTs. 
Safety Analyses 
The All Patients as Treated (APaT) analysis population was used for safety analyses which consisted of 
all allocated participants who received at least one dose of 9vHPV vaccine and had provided safety 
data at any time during the study. 
Since this was a single-group study with no comparator group, safety assessments were descriptive in 
nature.  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 205 participants were screened for the study; 4 were ineligible due to certain 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. The remaining 201 participants were randomized at a single-centre. One of

the randomized participants did not receive 9vHPV vaccine and was therefore excluded from all 
immunogenicity and safety analyses.  
Almost all participants (98.5%) completed the 3-dose 9vHPV vaccine regimen. Three participants 
(1.5%) discontinued from the study due to protocol deviation or withdrawal by participant.

Immunogenicity results 
All participants in the HPV type-specific PPI population seroconverted for each of the HPV types by 
Month 7. The lower limit of the 95% CI of the seroconversion percentage was greater than 96% for 
each HPV type, which met the predefined statistical criterion (the lower limit of the 95% CI to be 
greater than 90%) for acceptable anti-HPV seroconversion. 
Robust anti-HPV GMT responses were observed for all HPV types in each of the HPV type specific PPI 
population by Month 7 (4 weeks post-dose 3). In a subgroup analysis stratified by age, a trend 
towards higher GMTs was observed in 9 to 15-year old participants compared to 16 to 26-year old 
participants at Month 7 across the 9 HPV types.

Primary Immunogenicity Endpoint 
•  All participants in the PPI population seroconverted for each of the 9vHPV vaccine types (6, 11, 
16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 48, and 58) by Month 7. 
• 
The lower limit of the 95% CI of the seroconversion percentage was greater than 98% for each 
HPV vaccine type, such that the primary immunogenicity hypothesis was met. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoint 
•  Robust anti-HPV GMT responses were observed for all HPV vaccine types following the 
administration of 3 doses of 9vHPV.

Safety results 
Approximately half of the participants reported at least 1 AE from Day 1 to Day 15 following 
vaccination. Nearly half of the participants (45.0%) had injection-site AEs, all of which were deemed 
vaccine related. Seventeen percent of participants had systemic AEs, the majority of which were not 
considered to be vaccine related. 
Only 1 SAE was reported, which was not considered to be vaccine related. No participant died during 
the study. No participant discontinued vaccine due to AEs. 
Similar observations were made for AEs reported between Day 1 to Month 7.

• 
The incidence of systemic AEs and vaccine-related systemic AEs was low (17.0% and 1.0%, 
respectively). 
•  Most injection-site and systemic AEs were mild in intensity. 
•  One SAE was reported, which was not considered vaccine related. 
•  No participant discontinued vaccine due to AEs. 
•  No participant had a temperature elevation of ≥37.8oC (100.0oF) during the 5 days following 
any vaccination visit. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This study (V503-017) was designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the 9vHPV vaccine 
in 9 to 26-year-old male and female participants in order to support licensure in Vietnam. 
Compliance with the study protocol was good. Overall, of the 201 participants enrolled in this study, 
198 (98.5%) of participants completed the study. 
Immunogenicity 
The 9vHPV vaccine elicited a 100% seroconversion rate in this study with all baseline seronegative 
participants who received the vaccine by Month 7 (4 weeks post-dose 3) for each of the HPV types. 
The vaccine was highly immunogenic as demonstrated by robust antibody responses to all vaccine 
types following administration of a 3-dose regimen of the 9vHPV vaccine. 
Robust anti-HPV GMT responses observed in this study suggest that the HPV antibody levels observed 
in V503-017 are sufficient to generate protection against HPV infection and disease in the Vietnamese 
population. The trend of higher GMTs in the younger age group compared to the older age group 
observed in this study is consistent to those observed in global studies of the 9vHPV vaccine. 
Safety 
Administration of 9vHPV vaccine was generally well tolerated among study participants. About half of 
the participants in the study had vaccine-related injection-site pain, most of which were mild in 
intensity. No participant in the study experienced any vaccine related SAE. Only 2 participants had 
vaccine related systemic AEs, which resolved completely. 
The safety findings in this study were generally comparable to the tolerability findings reported for 
several other international 9vHPV vaccine studies. 
The study population was relatively small (N= 201) and including only small fraction of children at age 
9 to 15 (N=101) and therefore the chance to detect rare AEs and SAEs is low. No new safety concern 
is raised from this study. In conclusion, the 9vHPV vaccine was highly immunogenic and well tolerated 
in both male and female study participants, 9 to 26 years of age in Vietnam. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The results of this study indicate no new efficacy or safety concern. The P46 procedure is considered 
fulfilled. No further regulatory action required.

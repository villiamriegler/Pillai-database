PART VI  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for Prograf™, Advagraf™, Modigraf™ 
(Systemic Tacrolimus) 
This is a summary of the RMP for Prograf™, Advagraf™, and Modigraf™. The RMP details 
important risks of Prograf, Advagraf, and Modigraf, how these risks can be minimized, and 
how more information will be obtained about these risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
Prograf, Advagraf, and Modigraf SmPCs and its package leaflets, give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how it should be used.  
In the EU, Prograf capsules and concentrate for infusion are authorized via mutual 
recognition procedure/national procedures; consequently, there is no European Public 
Assessment Report (EPAR) for Prograf.  
Advagraf and Modigraf are authorized via centralized procedures. 
This summary of the RMP for Prograf, Advagraf and Modigraf should be read in the context 
of all this information, including, for the centrally authorized products Advagraf and 
Modigraf, the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of 
which is part of the EPAR.  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Prograf, 
Advagraf, and Modigraf’s RMP. 
I 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Prograf is authorized for prophylaxis of transplant rejection in liver, kidney or heart allograft 
recipients; and for the treatment of allograft rejection, resistant to treatment with other 
immunosuppressive medicinal products (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
tacrolimus monohydrate as the active substance, and it is given orally or is available as a 
concentrate solution for infusion. 
Advagraf is authorized for prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver 
allograft recipients; and for the treatment of allograft rejection, resistant to treatment with 
other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adult patients (refer to SmPC for the full 
indication). It contains tacrolimus monohydrate as the active substance, and it is given orally. 
Modigraf is authorized for prophylaxis of transplant rejection in liver, kidney or heart 
allograft recipients; and for the treatment of allograft rejection, resistant to treatment with 
other immunosuppressive medicinal products (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
tacrolimus monohydrate as the active substance, and it is given orally. 
 
Further information about the evaluation of the centrally authorized products Advagraf and 
Modigraf benefits can be found in Advagraf’s and Modigraf’s EPARs, including in its plain-
language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/advagraf and 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/modigraf. 
II 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or 
further characterize the risks  
Important risks of Prograf, Advagraf, and Modigraf, together with measures to minimize 
such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about Prograf, Advagraf, and 
Modigraf's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
●  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and the SmPC, addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
● 
●  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen as to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
●  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute the routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about the adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and is regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action 
can be taken if necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Prograf, Advagraf, and Modigraf are those risks that need special risk 
management activities to further investigate or minimize them, so that the medicinal product 
can be safely administered or taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. 
Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of 
Prograf, Advagraf, and Modigraf. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with 
the use of this medicine is possible, based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information 
regarding the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups 
Table continued on next page 
The increased risk in transplant recipients for developing cancer 
has been well described in the literature and Clinical Practice 
Guidelines and is also based on data from tacrolimus post-
marketing experience. 
Risk factors for posttransplant malignancy include traditional risk 
factors such as advancing age, smoking, drinking alcohol, 
obesity, sun exposure, and family history, and risk factors that are 
unique to the transplant population, including 
immunosuppression, oncogenic viral infections, and disease-
specific associations (e.g. factors related to end-stage organ 
disease or dialysis in the case of kidney transplant recipients) 
[Rossi and Klein, 2019; Acuna, 2018]. 
 
 
Important Identified risk: Malignant neoplasms 
Risk minimization measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Section 4.8 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 in which a warning is included that 
concomitant use of tacrolimus and anti-lymphocyte treatment 
increases the risk of Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV)-associated 
lymphoproliferative disorders. 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 in which recommendations are given to 
limit the exposure to sunlight 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 in which a recommendation is given to 
ascertain, in EBV- Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA)-negative

Important Identified risk: Serious infections and reactivation of pre-existing 
infections 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
Table continued on next page 
Increased risk and severity of infection in kidney transplant 
recipients are explained by many factors, including the recipient’s 
condition, such as surgical complications, or the use of 
indwelling catheters; the possibility of transmission of infection 
from donor to recipient; overimmunosuppression; active 
smoking; and obesity, etc.  
Viral infections in kidney transplant recipients, which occur more 
frequently during the first few months, are most likely in the 
context of greater immunosuppression. Furthermore, recipient 
age is often a significant risk factor for bacterial infections, but 
not viral/fungal infections. Type of immunosuppressive agent 
such as use of induction therapy with antithymocyte globulin is 
also associated with viral infection. 
The relationship between bacterial infection in kidney transplant 
recipients and overimmunosuppression is well established. 
However, in many cases there are additional identifiable risk 
factors for bacterial infection, including surgical complications, 
intravenous or urinary catheters, urinary retention or 
vesicoureteral reflux. Patients with a tuberculin purified protein 
derivative-positive skin test or a positive IFN-γ release assay for 
tuberculosis before transplantation are also at increased risk of 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection after transplantation 
[Neuberger, 2017]. 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Section 4.8 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 including a warning in SmPC Section 4.4 
about the increased risk for serious infections or reactivation 
of infections, often related to a high total immunosuppressive 
burden, which may lead to serious or fatal conditions. 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 in which the recommendation is given to 
consider, in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed 
patients with deteriorating hepatic or renal function or 
neurological symptoms, that these conditions may be 
associated with serious infections or reactivation of 
infections. 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 in which the recommendation is given for 
prevention and management of infections in accordance with 
appropriate clinical guidance. 
•  SmPC Section 4.9 in which recommendations are given in 
case of accidental overdose.

the epidemiology of medication errors and error-related adverse 
events in adults, in primary care, ambulatory care and patients’ 
homes. Risk factors for medication errors listed in this 2018 review, 
related to patients, healthcare professionals and/or medications are 
listed below [Assiri et al, 2018].  
Patient related risk factors for the development of medication errors: 
polypharmacy, increased age, number of diseases or comorbidities, 
female gender, low level of education, hospital admission and 
middle family income.  
Risk factors related to healthcare professionals for the development 
of medication errors: more than one physician involved in their care, 
general practice (GP), age ≥51 years, male GP, frequent changes in 
prescription, not considering the prescription of other physicians, 
inconsistency in the information and outpatient clinic visits  
Medication related risk factors for the development of medication 
errors: multiple medication storage locations used, expired 
medication present, discontinued medication repeats retained, 
hoarding of medications, therapeutic duplication, no medication 
administration routine, poor adherence and patients confused by 
generic and trade names. 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Sections 4.2 and 4.8 
•  SmPC Section 4.4, in which medication errors are addressed and 
recommendations are given to maintain patients on a single 
formulation of tacrolimus and to alter formulations or regimen 
only under the close supervision of a transplant specialist 
•  SmPC Section 4.2 in which recommendations are given about 
the need for therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustments 
following conversion to any alternative formulation.

This important identified risk has been well described in drug 
interaction studies, literature and is also based on data from 
tacrolimus post-marketing experience. 
Particularly patients that use tacrolimus and require medications 
or herbal remedies which are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., 
such as telaprevir, boceprevir, ritonavir, ketoconazole, 
voriconazole, itraconazole, telithromycin or clarithromycin) or 
inducers (e.g., such as rifampicin, rifabutin) are at risk. 
Genetic CYP3A polymorphisms may have an impact on drug 
metabolism and a person’s ability to metabolize certain drugs can 
be increased (“fast” metabolizers) or decreased (“poor” 
metabolizers). To date, the influence of CYP3A polymorphisms 
on the metabolism of tacrolimus and clinical consequences 
thereof remains to be further elucidated. It is not clear whether 
pharmacogenetic profiling can be a useful clinical tool for 
identifying high risk patients and better guiding tacrolimus dosing 
in clinical practice (Birdwell et al, 2015; Chen & Prasad, 2018). 
•  Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Section 4.2 in which a recommendation is given about 
monitoring of blood trough levels of tacrolimus following co-
administration of substances which may alter tacrolimus 
whole blood concentrations. 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 in which a recommendation is given to 
closely monitor tacrolimus blood levels, and to adjust the 
tacrolimus dose as appropriate in order to maintain similar 
tacrolimus exposure, when used concomitantly with 
inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 in which a recommendation is given to 
avoid concomitant use with herbal preparations. 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 and 4.5 in which a recommendation is 
given to avoid concomitant use with ciclosporin or 
potassium-sparing diuretics. 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 and 4.5 in which a warning is included that 
certain combinations of tacrolimus with drugs known to have 
nephrotoxic or neurotoxic effects may increase the risk of 
these effects. 
 
 
Important Identified risk: Interaction with other medication and herbal drugs 
Risk minimization measures 
•  SmPC Section 4.5 in which a recommendation is given to 
closely monitor tacrolimus blood levels, as well as QT 
prolongation (with ECG), renal function and other side 
effects, whenever substances which have the potential to alter 
CYP3A4 metabolism or otherwise influence tacrolimus blood 
levels are used concomitantly. 
•  SmPC Section 4.5 in which a recommendation is given about 
other (not related to CYP3A4) interactions potentially leading 
to increased tacrolimus blood levels. 
•  SmPC Section 4.5 in which a recommendation is given about 
the effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicinal 
products because tacrolimus is a known CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
•  SmPC Section 4.5 in which a recommendation is given about 
the need of therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolic 
acid (MPA) when switching combination therapy from 
ciclosporin/MPA to tacrolimus/MPA or vice versa because 
ciclosporin interferes with the enterohepatic recirculation of 
MPA. 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 and 4.5 in which a recommendation is 
given to avoid the use of live attenuated vaccines.

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds:

•

• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing efgartigimod alfa was 
considered justified based on non-clinical and on preliminary clinical data showing improvement of 
relevant functional endpoints and symptoms scores; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent crisis characterised by 
muscle weakness affecting in particular muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, facial 
expressions, chewing, talking, and swallowing. Crisis can also affect muscles that control 
breathing, resulting in life-threatening respiratory impairment; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 2 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European 
Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing efgartigimod alfa will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. 
The sponsor has provided clinical data showing improvement of clinical scores and quality of life on 
top of standard of care with the proposed product. The Committee considered that this constitutes 
a clinically relevant advantage for the patients affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by a combination of weakness and 
fatigability of skeletal muscles, including ocular, bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles. Weakness is the 
result of an IgG antibody mediated, T-cell dependent immunological reaction against proteins in the 
postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of skeletal muscles (nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptors [AChR] and/or receptor-associated proteins). Patients present with muscle 
weakness, which typically worsens with continued activity (fatigue) and improves on rest. 
Exacerbations and remissions may occur, particularly during the first few years after the onset of the 
disease (Drachman, 2001). Remissions are rarely complete or permanent. 
Antibodies are present at NMJ, the site of pathology (Engel et al, 1979). About 80% to 90% of patients 
have detectable antibodies against the nicotinic AChR on the postsynaptic muscle membrane at the 
NMJ. Another 3% to 7% of patients have antibodies directed against MuSK, another NMJ protein. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Vyvgart is indicated as an add-on to standard therapy for the 
treatment of adult AChR-Ab seropositive generalized Myasthenia Gravis (MG) patients” falls within the 
scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of myasthenia gravis”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP.

Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The course of MG is often variable. Exacerbations and remissions may occur, particularly during the 
first few years of the disease. However, remissions are rarely complete or permanent. Myasthenia 
gravis might impair vision (diplopia and ptosis), facial muscles, chewing, speech, swallowing, walking, 
or talking. Difficulty in swallowing may occur because of weakness of the palate, tongue, or pharynx, 
which could lead to nasal regurgitation and aspiration of liquids or foods with the risk of a dangerous 
and difficult to treat infection of the upper and lower airways. Dysphagia and respiratory failure are 
factors known to be caused by MG, and several reports have highlighted the importance of dysphagia 
and aspiration precipitating a myasthenic crisis. Fifteen to 20% of myasthenic patients are affected by 
myasthenic crisis at least once in their lives. Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening complication of MG 
where the majority of patients require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. 
The diagnosis of MG in AChR-antibody-seropositive patients has been associated with increased 
estimated mortality rates (1.41 compared to healthy individuals) especially in patients with late-onset 
disease (>50 years old at onset) (Hansen et al, 2016). 
The condition is therefore both life threatening and chronically debilitating.  
Number of people affected or at risk 
In the initial ODD (Orphan Drug Designation) for efgartigimod for treatment of MG in 2018, the COMP 
agreed on a prevalence estimate of approximately 2 per 10,000 persons (EMA 2018). The estimate 
was supported by literature references identified through a literature search in July 2017. This search 
has now been conducted again, covering publications available up until 31 May 2021. 
A total of 19 European literature references published after 2010 provided direct prevalence estimates 
from established epidemiological data for populations in the EEA (Table 1).

1.1 
The average prevalence of MG published for populations in Europe between 2010 and today is 2.04 per 
10,000 people (range 1.1 to 3.6). For the prevalence values calculated since 2015 (Boldingh et al, 
2015a; García Estévez et al, 2020, Martinka et al, 2018, Westerberg and Punga, 2020; Zieda et al, 
2018), the average is higher 2.45/10,000, range 1.1 to 3.6). Due to the very small number of 
publications, and the small patient samples, it cannot be determined if this increase is indeed indicative 
of a general trend towards higher prevalence. Therefore, the previously accepted prevalence estimate 
of approximately 2 in 10,000 persons in the European Union (EU) is still considered to be applicable. 
The COMP supported a prevalence estimate of approximately 2 in 10,000 persons in the EU.

The mainstays of the routine management of MG are defined in international consensus guidelines, 
most recently in the International Consensus Guidance for Management of Myasthenia Gravis 
(Narayanaswami et al, 2021). This guidance includes the following recommendations: 
•  The AChE inhibitor pyridostigmine should be part of the initial treatment in most patients with 
MG. 
•  Corticosteroids or NSIST therapy for patients who have not met treatment goals after an 
adequate trial of pyridostigmine. NSISTs may be used alone when corticosteroids cannot be 
used. NSISTs that can be used in MG include azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate 
mofetil, methotrexate, and tacrolimus.  
•  Patients with refractory MG may be treated with chronic IVIg and chronic 
plasmapheresis/plasma exchange (PLEX) as maintenance therapy, cyclophosphamide, 
Rituximab. 
It is usually necessary to maintain some immunosuppression for many years, sometimes for life. 
Patients must be monitored for potential adverse effects and complications from immunosuppression 
and changing treatment may be required. 
Thymectomy is recommended to be considered early in disease in patients aged 18–50 years who have 
non-thymomatous generalised MG (gMG), AChR-Ab seropositive patients who have failed to respond to 
immunotherapy or who have intolerable side effects. It may also be considered in patients without 
AChR-Abs (Hehir and Silvestri, 2018). 
The guidance states that eculizumab should be considered in the treatment of severe, refractory, gMG 
in patients that are AChR-Ab positive (Hehir and Silvestri, 2018).

Significant benefit 
For the evaluation of significant benefit of efgartigimod (Vyvgart) and in view of the therapeutic 
indication, medicinal products from the following drug classes are considered satisfactory methods and 
are therefore of relevance for this evaluation: AChE inhibitors, NSISTs and corticosteroids. The 
monoclonal antibody eculizumab is only indicated for the treatment of (AChR-Ab+) patients with 
refractory MG. Other treatment options such as the short-term immune therapies of plasmapheresis/ 
plasma exchange (PLEX) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) are indicated and used in a subset of 
the MG population in which efgartigimod approval is not being sought (i.e., patients with refractory MG 
and/or severe acute exacerbations).    
The sponsor claims that efgartigimod will be of significant benefit over relevant existing treatments for 
those affected by that condition, based on the following considerations:  
Efgartigimod demonstrated superior efficacy as add-on to standard of care therapy versus standard of 
care therapy plus placebo, in adult AChR-Ab seropositive patients with gMG in a randomised, controlled 
clinical trial (pivotal study ARGX-113-1704). Standard of care therapy included AChE inhibitors, NSISTs 
and corticosteroids. Efgartigimod was studied in patients who were symptomatic despite receiving at 
least one concomitant gMG therapy and 88.4% of the AChR-Ab+ patients in the study were receiving 
an AChEi, either alone in combination with steroids or NSIST. A total of 19 patients (13 in the 
efgartigimod group and 6 in the placebo group) received concomitant AChE inhibitors as sole 
concomitant therapy during cycle 1. As shown in Table 3, in the efgartigimod group, 11 (84.6%) 
patients were MG-ADL responders compared to 1 (16.7%) patient in the placebo group.  The response 
difference (95% CI) of 67.9% (32.3; 100.0) demonstrated a benefit of efgartigimod treatment 
compared to AChE inhibitor monotherapy. Similar results were seen in QMG scores (8/13[61.5%] 
versus 1/6 [16.7%]).

In study ARGX-113-1704, 79.2% of AChR-Ab seropositive patients were receiving steroids and 59.7% 
were receiving NSISTs demonstrating these therapies were not adequately treating their gMG. 
Efgartigimod has demonstrated efficacy in these patients. Additionally, subgroup analyses of patients 
who were receiving steroids, or were receiving NSISTs during the study show that efgartigimod 
treatment provided benefit, demonstrating a major clinical benefit over these treatments (see Table 4).

With regards to significant benefit of efgartigimod vs. eculizumab, data shows that efgartigimod is 
effective in treating patients that would not qualify for treatment with eculizumab. Eculizumab is 
authorised for the treatment of AChR-Ab seropositive patients with refractory gMG while the 
therapeutic indication for efgartigimod is not restricted to patients with refractory gMG. AChR-Ab 
seropositive patients with refractory gMG represent only approximately 10% of gMG patients and 
efgartigimod offers treatment to approximately 80 to 85% of the MG population with gMG.  
The sponsor also presents data from an indirect comparison of efficacy between efgartigimod and 
eculizumab. Mean improvement in MG-ADL score was 1.0 point greater for efgartigimod than for 
eculizumab with a 95% credible interval (CrI) of 0.8 to 1.2. The robustness and clinical relevance of 
these findings is however questioned. The sponsor also points out that following the initiation of 
treatment with efgartigimod clinical response has been shown to be obtained within 2 weeks of the 
initial infusion in the majority of patients. Time to treatment effect can take up to 6 to 12 months with 
NSISTs.  
The COMP also took note of feedback obtained from patient and consumer organisations during the MA 
review of Vyvgart by CHMP. The specific feedback concerning Vyvgart pertained to its dosing frequency 
and administration modality. Vyvgart is administered as a 1-hour IV infusion in cycles. One cycle 
consists of one infusion per week for 4 weeks The frequency of treatment cycles may vary by patient.  
In conclusion, significant benefit over relevant authorised therapies is considered to be established by 
the COMP. This is based on the efficacy data from the pivotal randomised, placebo-controlled 26-week 
study (ARGX-113-1704). Vyvgart demonstrated superior efficacy as add-on to standard of care 
therapy including AChE inhibitors, NSISTs and/or corticosteroids, versus standard of care therapy plus 
placebo, in adult AChR-Ab seropositive patients with gMG. Improvements pertained to the following 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints: 1) % responders in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily 
Living (MG-ADL) scale, 2) % responders in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scale, and 3) %

of Time of Clinically Meaningful Improvement in the AChR-Ab seropositive population. The COMP 
concluded that this represents a clinically relevant advantage over currently authorised therapies. 
4.  COMP position adopted on 24 June 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of myasthenia gravis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 2 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to muscle weakness affecting in 
particular muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, facial expression, chewing, talking, and 
swallowing. Recurrent myasthenic crisis can also affect muscles that control breathing, resulting in 
life-threatening respiratory impairment; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Vyvgart may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has provided clinical data showing 
improved efficacy of Vyvgart when used as adjunct treatment to standard of care, including 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs and/or corticosteroids, as 
compared to standard of care. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage for the patients affected by the condition.   
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Vyvgart, efgartigimod alfa, for 
treatment of myasthenia gravis (EU/3/18/1992) is not removed from the Community Register of

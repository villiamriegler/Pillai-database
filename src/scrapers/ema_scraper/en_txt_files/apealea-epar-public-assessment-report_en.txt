Paclitaxel is a well-known active substance which suffers from poor solubility in aqueous media. 
Therefore, commercial formulations include excipients capable of solubilising paclitaxel, e.g. Cremophor® 
EL. However, Cremophor® EL has allergenic properties which are not tolerated by some patients. The 
applicant’s goal in developing Apealea was to find a more tolerable Cremophor-free formulation of 
precautions taken during manufacture (nitrogen blanket, light exclusion) render it a reasonable 
alternative to Cremophor® EL-based formulations. Information on stability in clinical use is provided 
below. From a quality point of view the justification for the choice of these novel excipients is considered 
The novel excipients are light-sensitive, so manufacture, storage and use of the finished product requires

Taxanes agents are extensively taken up into hepatocytes by OATP1B transporters before metabolism 
and excretion. Some solubilizers used in the galenic formulations of paclitaxel can inhibit this process in 
a time-dependent fashion and the potential of drug-drug interactions mediated by these transporters is 
therefore  dependent  on  the  selected  paclitaxel  formulation.  Paclitaxel  is  reportedly  a  substrate  for 
OATP1B3 (Smith et al., 2005; Letschert et al., 2006; van de Steeg et al., 2013) and also for OATP1A2

inhibitory activity towards this transporter, with IC50 values of 6.3 and 4.4 μM, respectively. No inhibition 
was observed at 1 μM of either isomer. Taking protein binding and Cmax of unbound excipients estimated 
from total Cmax in study OAS-13-XR17 into account (at a dose 1.35-fold the clinical dose of Apealea), the 
clinical relevance seems remote. Therefore, the absence of a warning statement regarding the inhibition 
of OATP1B1 by these excipients is justified.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Paclitaxel is a well-established cytotoxic agent with several decades of clinical use in the management of 
solid tumours such as breast cancer, carcinoma of the ovary, NSCLC and AIDS- related Kaposi’s sarcoma. 
Clinical experience has been gained with the active substance since 1992. The PD activity of paclitaxel is 
to assess the pharmacodynamics of neutropenia associated with paclitaxel. This model is based on three 
steps of haematopoiesis: proliferation, transit and the circulation of mature neutrophils. Paclitaxel inhibits 
could be provided by the Applicant due to the limited data available in patients.  
Known toxicity includes haematological and GI toxicity, neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity.

Although no PK comparison can be made between Apealea and Taxol based on the OAS-07PK study due 
to deficiencies in the bioanalytical method, the study OAS-09-APPK ultimately allows concluding that the

paclitaxel fraction was similar after administration of both formulations (and although not strictly meeting 
the  bioequivalence  margins,  comparable  exposure  could  also  be  concluded  for  total  paclitaxel). 
Therefore, the entirety of data are considered to be sufficient for this full application as this enables the 
bridging of the package of pharmacokinetic data observed for Abraxane. In addition, this constitutes a

Specific  studies  with  Apealea  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  are  not  necessary.  The  SmPC

between the renal function groups. Patients with mildly or moderately impaired renal function (glomerular

comparator (Taxol), containing the same active moiety, the synthesis method for determination of M2 
was selected. This method "makes use of the variability from both the NI trial and the historical trials and

The treatment effects in the subgroups defined based on the time from initial diagnosis to study entry, the 
platinum-free  interval,  dose  delay  and  dose  reduction  are  shown  in  the  figure  below.  The  forest  plot 
indicates that a time from initial diagnosis of 1 to 2 years and a platinum-free interval of 6-12 months 
favours Apealea. Further, the plot suggests that the trend in favour of Apealea was unaffected by whether

Given the discussion regarding the appropriateness of the chosen dose, it is concerning that more dose 
reductions and delays were seen in the Apealea group in the PIII study. Finally, there was a slightly higher 
RDI (relative dose intensity) in the Taxol group, suggesting that at best the safety profile of both drugs is 
rather similar and at worst that the safety profile of Apealea is less favourable. 
Patients receiving Apealea saw an almost double need of dose reductions than those in the Taxol group 
(11% versus 6%), and this trend was also visible in dose reductions for carboplatin whereby about 50% 
more patients needed dose reduction in the Apealea group (16% versus 10%). 
The  preferred  way  to  handle  especially  haematological  adverse  effects  was  to  prolong  the  interval 
between two treatments beyond 3 weeks and continue with the same dose, 60% patients in Apealea and 
46% of patients in Taxol group had at least one dose delayed.

The  only  exception  to  this  case  is  the  SAE  ‘neutropenia’  (and  in  lesser  degree  ‘leukopenia’, 
‘granulocytopenia’ and ‘febrile neutropenia’) in the SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders. Given that

regard to optimal dose of Apealea that would have acceptable toxicity and similar efficacy given that dose 
intensification strategies do not appear to be associated with improved efficacy in ovarian cancer.

This new formulation is aimed to reduce hypersensitivity reactions. However the true incidence, severity

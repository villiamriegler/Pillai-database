2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The current commercial formulation of acalabrutinib (Calquence) is presented as a 100 mg hard 
capsule for oral administration.  
The purpose of this submission is to extend the current Marketing Authorisation to add a new 
pharmaceutical form of acalabrutinib maleate 100 mg (free base equivalent amount) in a film-coated 
tablet. The proposed clinical use for the tablet will be for the same indications which are currently 
approved for the 100 mg acalabrutinib capsule.  
The aim of introducing the tablet, which has higher solubility over the full pH range compared to the 
approved capsule formulation, is to allow acalabrutinib to be co-administered with gastric acid reducing 
agents.  
This submission is supported by one bioequivalence study (D8223C0013) and one study to evaluate 
bioavailability in addition to the effect of PPI and food on the tablet formulation (D8220C00018).  
2.2.  About the product 
Acalabrutinib (ACP-196),  is a highly selective, potent, orally bioavailable, covalent inhibitor of BTK. 
Acalabrutinib forms a covalent bond with Cys481 in the BTK adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pocket, 
permanently inactivating the enzyme and resulting in the inhibition of proliferation and survival signals 
in malignant B cells. Acalabrutinib has an active metabolite, ACP-5862, that is also a covalent inhibitor 
of BTK. Biochemical profiling showed that the pharmacological activity and kinase selectivity profile for 
ACP-5862 was comparable to that of acalabrutinib. 
Calquence is currently commercially available as an immediate release capsule comprising 100 mg of 
the acalabrutinib free base. The current label for this product restricts its administration with acid 
reducing agents (ARAs), including the recommendation that patients avoid co-administration with 
proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and that dosing should be staggered with H2 receptor antagonists and 
antacids. These label restrictions are related to the low drug solubility above pH 4. 
A 100 mg acalabrutinib maleate film-coated tablet (free base equivalent), which show complete drug 
dissolution regardless of pH conditions in the gastrointestinal tract has therefore been developed. 
Acalabrutinib maleate film-coated tablet dosed at 100 mg in acidic stomach conditions is shown to 
supersaturate in neutral intestinal conditions and allow acalabrutinib to be co-administered with ARAs. 
Hence, removal of the recommendations to avoid concomitant PPI use or to stagger dosing with H2 
receptor antagonists and antacids from the product labelling are proposed for the tablet formulation. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
No prior Scientific Advice has been sought from the CHMP for the proposed line extension application.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product presentation applied for in this line extension is presented as film-coated tablets 
containing acalabrutinib maleate hydrate equivalent to 100 mg of acalabrutinib as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet core: mannitol (E421), microcrystalline cellulose (E460), low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose 
(E463) and sodium stearyl fumarate. 
Tablet coating: Hypromellose (E464), copovidone, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol, medium-chain 
triglycerides, iron oxide yellow (E172) and iron oxide red (E172). 
The product is available in aluminium/aluminium blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The film coated tablets applied for in this line extension contain the maleate hydrate form of the active 
substance, in contrast to the approved hard capsules which contain the unsolvated free base form. 
The chemical name of acalabrutinib maleate is 4-{8-amino-3-[(2S)-1-(but-2-ynoyl)pyrrolidin-2-
yl]imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazin-1-yl}-N-(pyridine-2-yl)benzamide (2Z)-2-butenedioic acid hydrate (1:1:1) 
corresponding to the molecular formula C26H23N7O2.C4H4O4.H20. It has a relative molecular mass of 
599.59 g/mol (salt/hydrate form) and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of acalabrutinib maleate hydrate was inferred from the route of synthesis and 
elucidated by a combination of mass spectrometry (MS), 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), elemental analysis, and ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV). 
Acalabrutinib maleate hydrate has one chiral centre in the (S)-configuration as confirmed by single 
crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD).  
EMA/38803/2023  
Page 10/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by differential scanning calorimetry 
and thermogravimetric analysis. Acalabrutinib maleate is a slightly hygroscopic, white to pale brown 
crystalline powder. It exhibits pH-dependent solubility in aqueous media with greater solubility at 
acidic pH. Extensive polymorph screening demonstrated that the monohydrate is the 
thermodynamically stable form under ambient conditions. The proposed commercial manufacturing 
process consistently produces the monohydrate form. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing process of acalabrutinib maleate hydrate up to the acalabrutinib stage remains the 
same as the previously approved process. The process parameters, specifications and control strategy 
also remain essentially unchanged from the approved acalabrutinib file. The details for the salt 
formation step are considered adequate. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials, reagents, solvents and auxiliary materials have been 
presented and are found acceptable. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
There are no new impurities as compared with the free base. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of active substances. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  double  LDPE  bags  inside  a  rigid  drum.  The  primary  packaging 
material complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (FT-IR), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. The limits for particle 
size are set in line with the clinical batches. 
The absence of tests for water content, elemental impurities, some residual solvents used early in the 
process, residue of ignition/sulphated ash, polymorphism and microbial testing has been acceptably 
justified by the applicant.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 13 acalabrutinib maleate batches, pilot to production scale, from the 
proposed commercial manufacturer are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term and intermediate conditions 
(25 ºC / 60% RH and 30 °C / 75% RH respectively) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
EMA/38803/2023  
Page 11/33 
 
 
  
 
 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters 
were tested: description, assay, organic impurities, enantiomeric purity, polymorphic identity, particle 
size, water content and microbiological purity. No significant changes to any of the studied attributes 
were observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. Acalabrutinib maleate 
is not photosensitive. 
Stability data generated for acalabrutinib maleate drug substance when stored in an open container 
under storage conditions up to and including 70 °C / 75% RH and 80 °C / 50% RH show no significant 
change in description, organic impurities, enantiomeric purity or polymorphic identity. This data 
confirms that acalabrutinib maleate drug substance is stable when exposed to high humidity and 
temperature.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months stored below 30 
°C in the proposed container. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as oval, biconvex, film-coated tablets containing acalabrutinib 
maleate equivalent to 100 mg acalabrutinib free base, and measuring approximately 7.5×13 mm. The 
tablets are debossed with ‘ACA 100’ on one side and are plain on the reverse. The composition of 
Calquence film-coated tablets was presented. 
Formulation development was performed to meet the criteria described in the Quality Target Product 
Profile (QTPP): an oral immediate release film-coated tablet containing acalabrutinib able to meet the 
clinical need, quality and pharmacopoeial requirements including purity, and free from microbial 
contamination. Acalabrutinib free base is used in the already-approved capsules but suffers from low 
solubility above pH 4. As a result, the SmPC currently restricts administration of Calquence capsules 
with acid-reducing agents such as proton pump inhibitors, antacids and H2-antagonists. Oncology 
patients are likely to take an average of five medications concomitantly, including acid reducing 
agents. Therefore, an acalabrutinib formulation was sought which allows sufficient solubility to be 
maintained above pH 4. A screen of different salts identified acalabrutinib maleate as a salt which 
exhibits higher solubility above pH 4. 
Acalabrutinib maleate is considered to be a BCS class 2 drug (high permeability and low solubility). 
Acalabrutinib maleate film-coated tablet dissolution is complete across the physiological pH range and 
is faster than the dissolution observed from acalabrutinib capsules. No precipitation of acalabrutinib 
was observed upon changing the pH of a solution of the film-coated tablet from acidic to neutral under 
biorelevant conditions. 
Acalabrutinib maleate was found to be compatible with a range of commonly used excipients for the 
development of solid oral dosage forms, including diluents, binders, disintegrants and lubricants. All 
the excipients ultimately chosen are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this 
report. 
EMA/38803/2023  
Page 12/33 
 
 
  
 
 
Several prototype tablets were made using different formulations including direct compression. Dry 
granulation by roller compaction was selected as the commercial manufacturing process in order to 
maximise the drug load in the formulation over what was considered achievable by direct compression. 
This allows production of a smaller dosage form for the same active substance content and thus, 
improved acceptability for patients taking multiple medicines. 
Development of the dissolution method considered the clinical setting, i.e. the need for tablets to 
dissolve in the stomach at low pH or at higher pH when co-administered with proton pump inhibitors. 
Compendial apparatus and conditions are otherwise used (paddles, 75 rpm). The method was shown to 
discriminate between batches manufactured with active substance batches of differing particle size 
distributions and batches manufactured with meaningful changes in process parameters. It can also 
distinguish between capsules and tablets. Tablets and capsules were found to be bioequivalent in a 
clinical study conducted under appropriate conditions. 
The primary packaging is aluminium/aluminium blisters. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 5 main steps: conventional mixing, dry granulation, 
compression, film-coating and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing 
process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on 3 consecutive productions scale 
batches. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this 
type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including description, identification (UHPLC, UV), assay (UHPLC), degradation products (UHPLC), 
related substances (ACP-7341, LC-HRAMS), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.) 
and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The impurities are adequately qualified at the specified limits. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities and no significant risk 
was identified. Batch analysis data on 4 pilot scale batches using a validated ICP-MS method was 
provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was well below 30% of the respective 
PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that no elemental 
impurity controls are needed. 
The applicant submitted a risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamines in the finished 
product. Both active substance and finished product manufacturing processes were considered, along 
with raw materials and packaging. ACP-1049 is an impurity in the active substance and a finished 
product degradant and contains a secondary amine susceptible to nitrosation in the presence of 
adventitious nitrite. Therefore, the CHMP requested the applicant to conduct confirmatory testing for 
the respective nitrosamine impurity using a suitably sensitive analytical method as a major objection. 
The results indicate the impurity is present. An acceptable intake (AI) was derived and the impurity is 
EMA/38803/2023  
Page 13/33 
 
 
  
 
 
now controlled in line with this limit. The limit is adequately justified, and the major objection is 
considered resolved. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 5 pilot scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), 18 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH), and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative of those proposed for marketing and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content, 
enantiomeric purity, tablet hardness and microbiological quality. There were small but observable 
increases in the specified impurities over time, more so at elevated temperature, which justify wider 
shelf-life limits for some impurities. No significant changes to any other measured parameters were 
observed. 
In addition, 1 batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing  of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product is photostable. 
Finally, a study was conducted to justify bulk storage for up to 2 years in aluminium foil bags. Data from 
2  production  scale  batches  stored  for  up  to  2  years  under  long  term,  intermediate  and  accelerated 
conditions support the proposed bulk shelf-life. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without specific storage conditions 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The film-coated tablets, subject of this line extension, contain 
a different salt form of the active substance compared to the approved capsules. This allows 
dissolution at higher pH and means the label restrictions associated with the capsules are not 
necessary for the tablets. Bioequivalence between the two formulations has been demonstrated. 
During the procedure, a new nitrosamine impurity (ACP-7341) was identified in the finished product. 
The MAH developed a suitably sensitive analytical method and provided batch data which complies with 
the AI. The control strategy is considered to be acceptable.

The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The full nonclinical safety profile of acalabrutinib has been discussed in detail in the original marketing 
application for Calquence.  Additional toxicology studies have been submitted with this application to 
support the use of acalabrutinib maleate tablet in the proposed indications.  These studies were 
conducted to qualify a degradation product in acalabrutinib maleate drug product and to assess the 
mutagenic potential of two theoretical N-nitrosamine impurities. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
No new pharmacology studies were submitted with this application. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetics studies were submitted with this application. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Studies on impurities 
ACP-6169 
A 1 month repeat dose study in the rat was conducted to qualify ACP-6169, a degradation product in 
the acalabrutinib maleate drug product. 
Four groups of Han Wistar rats, each consisting of 10 males and 10 females (main study) and 3 males 
and 3 females (toxicokinetics), were given acalabrutinib maleate or acalabrutinib free-base orally, once 
daily, at a dose level of 100 mg/kg/day for 28 days. 
Acalabrutinib maleate-related and acalabrutinib free base-related, non-adverse pancreas microscopic 
findings were noted in male rats only at 100 mg/kg/day and were characterised by minimal 
EMA/38803/2023

(acalabrutinib maleate) or mild to moderate (acalabrutinib free base) pancreatic islet 
haemorrhage/inflammation/fibrosis/intrahistiocytic pigment. There was no difference in the nature of 
the pancreas microscopic findings between acalabrutinib maleate and acalabrutinib free base. 
For all other parameters, there were no test item related changes considered to be related to 
administration of acalabrutinib maleate or acalabrutinib free base. 
ACP-7341 and ACP-7512 
ACP-7341 and ACP-7512 are two theoretical N-nitrosamine impurities that may be present in 
acalabrutinib maleate drug substance. The potential mutagenicity of these theoretical N-nitrosamines 
was evaluated in Ames test. The design of Ames tests for these impurities was optimised to increase 
the detection of the potential mutagenic/carcinogenic activity of N-nitrosamines. As such, potential 
mutagenicity of these N-nitrosamines was evaluated in the presence of rat and hamster metabolic 
activators (S9-mix). Mutagenicity of ACP-7512 was assessed in the presence of hamster and rat S9 
mix in a single Ames assay. The same strategy was used for mutagenicity evaluation of ACP-7341, 
however assessments in the presence of hamster and rat S9 mix were conducted in two separate 
Ames assays. 
ACP-7341 
ACP-7341 is a nitrosamine that theoretically could be formed from the known impurity ACP-1049 
ACP-7341 was tested for mutagenic activity using genetically modified Salmonella typhimurium LT2 
bacteria of strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98 and TA100, and Escherichia coli WP2 strain uvrA/pKM101 as 
indicator organisms in the presence of a hamster liver S9-based metabolic activation system (S9 mix).  
Preliminary assessments of solubility were not conducted as part of this study as ACP-7341 had been 
tested in a previous study in which dimethyl formamide (DMF) was found to be suitable. DMF was 
therefore used throughout this study as the solvent for the test item. 
The dose range used was 1.6 to 5000 μg per plate. For comparison with the in-house historical control 
database, concurrent dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) controls were also tested. 
No significant increase in numbers of revertant (histidine/tryptophan-independent) colonies was seen 
after treatment with ACP-7341 with any of the five indicator strains in the presence of hamster liver S9 
mix. 
It was concluded that ACP-7341 was not mutagenic when tested under the conditions used in this 
assay. 
ACP 7512 
ACP-7512 is a nitrosamine that theoretically could be formed from the known impurity ACP-5516. 
ACP-7512 was tested for mutagenic activity using genetically modified Salmonella typhimurium LT2 
bacteria of strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98 and TA100, and Escherichia coli WP2 strain uvrA/pKM101 as 
indicator organisms.  
Preliminary assessments of solubility were conducted. As dimethyl formamide was found to be suitable, 
this was used throughout this study as the solvent for the test item.  
The test item dose range used was 0.5 to 5000 μg per plate. In addition to solvent (dimethyl 
formamide) controls, for comparison with the in-house historical control database, concurrent dimethyl 
sulphoxide controls were tested. 
EMA/38803/2023  
Page 16/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
There was no evidence of cytotoxicity.  The maximum dose level scored for numbers of revertant 
colonies was 5000 μg per plate.   
No significant increase in numbers of revertant (histidine/tryptophan-independent) colonies was seen 
after treatment with ACP-7512 for any of the five indicator strains in the presence of either rat or 
hamster liver S9 mix or in the absence of S9 mix. 
It was concluded that ACP-7512 was not mutagenic when tested under the conditions used in this 
assay.  
Proposal for an AI for ACP-7341 
The MAH chose to propose an AI based on a read-across strategy and to implement Quality control to 
meet this limit. N-nitrosopyrrolidine was selected for the read-across, as it is the only molecule to 
contain the same nitrosamine structural moiety as ACP-7341 and with carcinogenicity data available. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Based on the Environmental Risk Assessment for acalabrutinib previously submitted to support the 
initial Market Authorisation Application for Calquence (Procedure Number EMEA/H/C/005299/0000) 
which was approved on 05 November 2020 acalabrutinib is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. The changes described in this submission have no effect on environmental exposure. 
Therefore, in accordance with the European Medicines Agency guidance, EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 
corr2 (CHMP 2006), a revised ERA for acalabrutinib was not submitted with this application. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A 1 month repeat dose study in the rat was conducted to qualify ACP-6169, a degradation product in 
the acalabrutinib maleate drug product. With a NOAEL of 100 mg/kg, the maximum level of ACP-6169 
qualified by this study is 1.5% at a clinical dose of 200 mg per day. 
ACP-7341 and ACP-7512 were identified as two nitrosamines which theoretically could be present as 
drug substance impurities. The MAH performed Ames assays with these nitrosamines, in both cases 
with a negative outcome. As a consequence of these negative assays, in line with ICH M7 both were 
defined as class 5 and no further control measure or testing was considered necessary by the MAH. 
As a consensus on the appropriate conditions for the Ames assay for nitrosamines has not yet been 
reached, this position was not accepted by the CHMP. Further in vitro or in vivo mutagenicity 
evaluation was not pursued, due to the lack of an agreed position on appropriate assays for this 
purpose. 
The MAH  chose to propose an AI based on a read-across strategy and to implement Quality control to 
meet this limit. N-nitrosopyrrolidine was selected for the read-across, as it is the only molecule to 
contain the same nitrosamine structural moiety as ACP-7341 and with carcinogenicity data available.  
Based on the read-across-strategy, a limit for the nitrosamine ACP-7341 was proposed by the NCWP 
OEG on nitrosamines and the proposal as agreed by the CHMP. The MAH also accepted the limit and 
updated relevant sections of Module 3 accordingly.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Calquence capsules containing the active substance as a free base, and the free base has a low 
solubility at a pH above 4. Therefore, the bioavailability of acalabrutinib is decreased at higher stomach 
pH, and there are restriction in the use of gastric acid reducing agents (proton pump inhibitors should 
be avoided and H2-receptor antagonists or antacids must be administered at least 2 hours after 
Calquence according to the SmPC section 4.2). 
The current application is a line extension to the approved capsules and is a tablet formulation 
containing the maleate salt of acalabrutinib. The maleate salt has a higher solubility over the full pH 
range, and the aim was to develop a formulation that can be co-administered with gastric acid 
reducing agents. 
Pharmacokinetics were used to bridge the clinical efficacy and safety data for the approved capsules to 
the new tablet maleate formulation. This was done through a bioequivalence study comparing the 
tablet to the capsule in fasting state (D8223C0013). In addition, the food effect and the effect of PPI 
(rabeprazole) of the new formulation was characterised in a multi-arm single dose study 
(D8220C00018).  
Samples from both studies were analysed for the content of acalabrutinib as well as ACP-5862 at using 
an HPLC-MS/MS method using isotope-labeled acalabrutinib or ACP-5862 as internal control (Method 
ID ACACHPP). The linear range was 1-1000 ng/mL for actabrutinib and 5-5000 ng/ml for ACP-5862. 
Study D8220C00018 was a 2-Part, phase I, open-label, single-dose, sequential randomized 
crossover study of new acalabrutinib maleate tablet in healthy subjects to evaluate relative 
bioavailability, proton pump inhibitor (rabeprazole) effect, food effect and particle size effect (not 
discussed further as this was not part of the current line extension application). The study was 
performed between June 2020 and January 2021.  
Study D8223C00013 was a phase I, open-label, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, crossover study 
in healthy subjects to assess the bioequivalence of acalabrutinib tablet and acalabrutinib capsule. The 
study was performed was performed between February-May2021. 
Bioequivalence 
In study D8223C00013, 66 healthy male and female subjects (50-100 kg) were included, and 64 
completed the study (two discontinuations occurred, one subject was lost to follow-up, one withdrew 
consent). The subjects were administered acalabrutinib capsule 100 mg (reference;) or acalabrutinib 
maleate tablet 100 mg (test;) after an overnight fast. The wash-out time between treatments was at 
least 5 days. 16 PK samples were taken in each period (pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 h post-dose). In addition, blood sampling for PD (BTK receptor occupancy) was 
performed predose, 4 and 12 h post dose as an exploratory endpoint). Primary endpoints were AUCinf, 
AUClast and Cmax.  
Bioequivalence of acalabrutinib was shown both with regards to Cmax (T/R ratio 1.00; 90% CI 0.91-
1.11) and AUCt (T/R ratio 0.99; 90% CI 0.94-1.04). The parameters for the metabolite ACP-5862 as 
well as AUCinf were within standard bioequivalence limits. (Table 1).

Similar target occupancy was observed in both groups.  
Influence of food 
The effect of a high fat breakfast on the bioavailability of the test tablet was assessed. 
Part 1 of the study had 4 armed and studied both test and reference in the fasting state, test with food 
and test with rabeprazole ( 
EMA/38803/2023  
Page 20/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Figure 2). 30 healthy male and female subjects (50-100 kg) were included, and 29 completed the 
study (one withdrew from the study). The subjects were administered acalabrutinib capsule 100 mg 
(reference) or acalabrutinib maleate tablet 100 mg (test).

Figure 2. Study design of study D8220C00018. Treatment A-reference, fasting state, B-test, 
fasting state, C-test, fed state, D- test together with rabetprazol 
In period A and B, the reference and test product, respectively, was administered after an overnight 
fast. 
In period C the test product was administered 30 minutes after start of a standardised, high-calorie, 
high-fat FDA breakfast. 
In period D, the test product was administered together with rabeprazole 20 mg administered on day -
3, -2 and -1 BID (with food), as well as 2 h before aclabrutinib administration (fasting)(See also 
interaction with PPI belowO.  
The wash-out time between treatments was at least 7 days. 15 PK samples were taken in each period 
(pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h post-dose). In addition, blood 
sampling for PD (BTK receptor occupancy) was performed predose, 4, 12 and 24 h h post dose as an 
exploratory endpoint). Primary endpoints were AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax of aclabrutinib.  
The Cmax was lower when the tablet was administered with food (Cmax ratio 0.46), whereas the total 
exposure (AUCinf) remained unchanged (fed/fasting AUC ratio 0.98; 90% CI 0.88-1.10) ( 
EMA/38803/2023  
Page 22/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Table 2). Tmax was longer with food, the median tmax under fed conditions was 2.00 h, range 0.25-
4.00 whereas the corresponding tmax under fasting conditions was 0.73 (0.25-1.53).

Interaction with PPI 
In study 8220C00018 the effect of rabeprazole on the bioavailability of the test tablet was also 
assessed.  
When the acalabrutinib maleate tablet was administered with rabeprazole, Cmax of acalabrutinib was 
lower (24% lower geometric mean) and AUCinf was higher (17% higher geometric mean) ( 
Table 3). Tmax was similar with rabeprazol, the median tmax with PPI was 1.01 h, range 0.23-3.00 
whereas the corresponding tmax under fasting conditions was 0.73 (0.25-1.53). 
Similar target occupancy was observed in both periods, after 24 hours the mean target occupancy 
(SD) in the rabeprazole period was 89.9%% (4.9) and the corresponding occupancy without PPI was 
89.6% (9.5)

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic study package performed by the applicant is considered adequate. Since only one 
strength is available and the capsule can be administered regardless of food, a single dose 
bioequivalence study in fasting condition is considered appropriate to bridge the clinical data of the 
approved formulation to the new tablet formulation. In addition, as the new formulation contains a salt 
formulation with a different sensitivity to pH, a characterisation of the effect of PPI and food on the 
new formulation is also requested. In general, it is enough to measure parent compound as it is the 
most sensitive entity to detect differences in absorption. 
The study design of the bioequivalence study was considered adequate. Given the short half-life of 
acalabrutinib (1-2 h) the sampling time as well as wash-out time was sufficient. Bioequivalence was 
shown under fasting conditions, and thus the clinical efficacy and safety of the capsule can be bridged 
to the new tablet formulation. 
A high fat meal made absorption of acalabrutinib from the tablet slower (longer tmax) and decreased 
Cmax with 54%. The exposure remained unchanged. These results are similar to those reported for 
the approved capsule (69% decrease in Cmax) and it is agreed that also the new formulation can be 
taken regardless of food. 
Rabeprazol was chosen as PPI to increase gastric pH in the DDI study, whereas omeprazole had been 
used in the studies of the approved capsule formulation. The MAH justifies the use of rabeprazole 
instead of omeprazole with a quicker onset of action reported for rabeprazole (maximum effect after 3 
days instead of 5 days for omeprazole) and that rabeprazole is less sensitive to CYP2C19 genotype due 
to a lower fraction CYP metabolism. This is considered acceptable. According to the SmPC of 
rabeprazole maximum effect on gastric pH is reached within 3 days and the dose is 20 mg BID is used 
for the eradication of H pylori (20 mg daily for gastric ulcer). The dosing regimen of rabeprazole 
chosen thus appears adequate. 
EMA/38803/2023  
Page 25/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
A small effect of rabeprazole was observed on the absorption of acalabrutinib from the tablet. The 
applicant provided a discussion about the potential mechanism(s) behind the increased bioavailability 
of acalabrutinib with rabeprazole, suggesting a potential effect of CYP3A4 inhibition caused by 
rabeprazole together with a potential effect of PPIs increasing gastric retention and thus increasing the 
time of acalabrutinib in the absorption window. Although the exact mechanisms behind the small 
effects seen on acalabrutinib absorption in the study is unclear, it is agreed with the MAH that the 
slightly lower Cmax and higher AUC is unlikely to be of clinical significance and that, unlike the 
approved capsule, the new tablet can be administered with acid reducing agents. Therefore, the 
proposed wording in Section 4.2 of the SmPC, that unlike the capsules, there are no restrictions in the 
co-administration of acalabrutinib tablets with gastric acid reducing agents (proton pump inhibitors, 
H2-receptor antagonists, antacids).   
At the request of the CHMP and in order to further highlight the differences between the formulations 
when co-administered with PPIs, the MAH has added additional warnings in Sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There are no objections to approval of this line extension from a clinical pharmacology point of view.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
No new data were submitted. 
2.6.6.  Clinical safety 
2.6.6.1.  Patient exposure 
Safety data on single doses in healthy subjects is provided from 30+24 subjects in the relative 
bioavailability study D8220C00018 and from 66 subjects in the bioequivalence study D8223C00013. 
2.6.6.2.  Adverse events 
Most AEs were of mild grade 1 in both studies and overall in line with the previously observed safety 
profile for the currently approved capsule. The number of subjects experiencing at least one AE in 
Study D8220C00018 was 9 (30.0%) and 8 (33.3%) subjects in Parts 1 and 2, respectively, and in 
Study D8223C00013 was 11 (16.7%) subjects. 
In Study D8220C00018 Part 1, 3 subjects experienced moderate AEs (headache in 2 [6.7%] subjects 
and rash pruritic in 1 [3.3%] subject); all AEs reported in Part 2 were mild in intensity. In Study 
D8223C00013, 1 subject (1.5%) experienced a Grade 2 (moderate) AE (dizziness). No Grade 3 or 
higher AEs were reported in either study.  
2.6.6.3.  Serious adverse events, deaths, and other significant events 
No subject in either study reported a fatal or serious AE.

2.6.6.4.  Laboratory findings 
Elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were reported in Study D8220C00018 in which one 
subject discontinued treatment due to a non-serious AE of increased ALT. The event was mild in 
intensity and resolved.  
In addition, 5 subjects had elevated ALT values in study D8220C00018. The onset of increased ALT 
occurred within 6-14 days after the first treatment with acalabrutinib, were mild in intensity, and 
resolved within 5-14 days after onset with the exception of one subject who had a slightly elevated but 
stable ALT at the last follow-up sample.

2.6.6.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Two subjects discontinued the IMP due to an AE, in both subjects a non-serious AE.  
One subject discontinued IMP due to a rash pruritic which was moderate in intensity, resolved, and not 
considered related to the IMP by the investigator.  
One subject discontinued IMP due to a non-serious AE of increased ALT with onset 6 days after first 
treatment which was mild in intensity, resolved within 23 days, and was considered related to the IMP 
by the investigator.  
2.6.6.10.  Post marketing experience 
No new data on safety has been reported. 
2.6.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data is provided from two studies on single doses in healthy subjects.  
Most of the reported AEs were of mild grade. No Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported. Overall, the 
safety profile is considered to be in line with previously observed safety profile for the acalabrutinib 
capsule. No new safety concerns were raised. 
Laboratory findings of increased ALT were observed in a number of subjects and one subject 
discontinued treatment due to a non-serious AE of increased ALT. The event was mild in intensity and 
EMA/38803/2023  
Page 27/33 
 
 
  
 
 
resolved. From this data, no new safety concern is raised with regard to hepatotoxicity. However, it is 
noted that in a separate procedure an update of the RMP is proposed to include hepatotoxicity as an 
important potential risk of acalabrutinib. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of hepatotoxicity events is 
requested as part of the PSUSA procedure. 
From a general safety perspective, the informative value of these data on single-dose administration in 
healthy individuals is limited. From a comparative perspective, the investigation of the proposed new 
tablet formulation compared with the capsule, in studies D8220C00018 and D8223C00013, does not 
suggest an inferior safety profile of the new tablet formulation. 
During a time period, both the capsule and tablet formulation of acalabrutinib will be available on the 
market. Considering the fact that concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors should only be used with 
the tablets but not with acalabrutinib tablets, there is a potential risk of medication error when both 
formulations are available on the market at the same time.   
The Applicant has described the following measures taken to reduce the risk for medication error:  
•  Swift transition to the tablet formulation, to minimise the time of access to both formulations 
• 
• 
• 
Provision of information about the switch plan to physicians, pharmacists, and patients 
Independent SmPCs and PLs with different administration instructions for each formulation 
Packaging designed to differentiate between the two formulations  
•  Routine pharmacovigilance and assessment of medication errors routinely in the PBRER 
The above measures were considered sufficient to minimise the potential for medication errors.  
2.6.8.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In terms of safety, no obvious differences between the formulations are noted.

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 4 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.Product 
information 
2.8.3.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Calquence 100 mg hard capsule. The bridging report 
submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
2.8.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Calquence (acalabrutinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
EMA/38803/2023

Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The purpose of this submission is to extend the current MA to add a new pharmaceutical form of 
acalabrutinib (100 mg acalabrutinib maleate film-coated tablet). The proposed clinical use for the 
tablet will be for the same indications which are currently approved for the 100 mg acalabrutinib 
capsule.  
. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Not relevant for this application. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical studies are the bioequivalence study D8223C0013, and study D8220C00018 to 
evaluate bioavailability in addition to the effect of PPI and food on the tablet formulation. Both studies 
were Phase I, open-label, randomized studies. 
The applied tablet formulation was compared to the previously approved capsule formulation, in 
healthy subjects (n = 120 in total). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The aim of introducing the tablet formulation, which has higher solubility over the full pH range 
compared to the approved capsule formulation, is to allow acalabrutinib to be co-administered with 
gastric acid reducing agents and by that benefit patients by enabling a less complex situation regarding 
multiple medications and interactions.   
Bioequivalence was demonstrated with regards to Cmax and AUC in study D8223C0013 comparing 100 
mg tablet with 100 mg capsule formulation under fasting conditions, and similar target occupancy was 
observed.   
A slightly lower Cmax and higher AUC was observed from the tablet formulation in combination with 
PPI rabeprazole, but these findings are considered unlikely to be of clinical significance, and allow the  
new tablet formulation to be co-administered with acid reducing agents.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no remaining uncertainties or limitations with the tablet formulation that have an impact on 
the benefit-risk balance.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
From a general safety perspective the informative value of these data on single-dose administration in 
healthy individuals is limited. From a comparative perspective, the investigation of the proposed new 
tablet formulation compared with the capsule, in studies D8220C00018 and D8223C00013, does not 
suggest an inferior safety profile of the new tablet formulation. In terms of safety, no obvious 
differences between the formulations are noted. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Not applicable. 
3.6.  Effects Table 
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The benefits of the new tablet formulations are acknowledged. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The B/R is considered positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Calquence is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
Recommendations. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Calquence is not similar to Gazyvaro within the meaning 
of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix on similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of, Calquence 100 mg film-coated tablets is favourable in the 
EMA/38803/2023

following indications: 
-monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). 
-as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Calquence subject 
to the following conditions:

1. 
Introduction 
Sitagliptin  phosphate  (Januvia)  is  an  orally  active  selective  inhibitor  of  the  enzyme  dipeptidyl 
peptidase 4 (DPP-4). DPP-4 inhibitors act by enhancing the levels of active incretin hormones. These 
hormones,  including  glucagon-like  peptide-1  and  glucose-dependent  insulinotropic  polypeptide,  are 
released  from  the  intestine  in  response  to a  meal  and  are  part of  an endogenous  system  involved  in 
glucose homeostasis. 
Januvia  was  approved  in  the  EU  in  March  2007  and  currently  has  the  following  indications:  
“For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Januvia is indicated: 
• 
to improve glycaemic control when diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic 
control and when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  combination  with  metformin  when  diet  and  exercise  plus 
metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
to improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus 
maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and 
when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  combination  with  a  sulphonylurea  and  metformin  when  diet 
and exercise plus dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
• 
• 
• 
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in whom use of a PPARγ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) is 
appropriate, Januvia is indicated: 
• 
in combination with the PPARγ agonist when diet and exercise plus the PPARγ agonist alone do 
not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
in combination with the PPARγ agonist and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy 
with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control.” 
• 
The MAH submitted this type II variation application to extend the indication as follows: 
“To  improve  glycaemic  control  as  an  adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  in  combination  with  insulin  and 
metformin.” 
To support this extension of indication, the MAH presented the results of study P051. This is a 24-
week-during  phase  III,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind  clinical  trial  to  study  the  safety  and 
efficacy of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who have inadequate glycaemic control 
on insulin therapy (alone or in combination with metformin). 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  MAH  included  an  EMEA  Decision 
{EMEA-000470-PIP01-08} on the agreement of a Paediatric Investigation Plan and on the granting of 
a deferral and on the granting of a waiver for sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate (Januvia). 
The waiver applies to “Children of less than 10 years, for sitagliptin film-coated tablets, oral use, on 
the grounds that the disease or condition for which the specific medicinal product is intended does not 
occur in the specified paediatric subset.” 
The  deferral  was  granted  for  the  subset(s)  of  the  paediatric  population  concerned  by  the  paediatric 
development from 10 to less than 18 years for sitagliptin film-coated tablets (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 
mg), oral use. 
2.   Non- clinical aspects 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
The ERA for sitagliptin phosphate submitted in the application for the current type II variation is an 
updated version of the ERA submitted by the MAH at the time of the initial application. 
Data  from  a  new  algae  growth  inhibition  test  pursuant  to  the  latest  OECD  201were  missing  in  the 
previous version, thus preventing a conclusion of the ERA for sitagliptin. 
The MAH has submitted in July 2009 the requested new algal study pursuant to the latest OECD 201. 
The CHMP concluded that the test was valid and that the risk to the surface water of sitagliptin can be 
assumed to be negligible.

3.   Clinical aspects 
3.1.   Clinical efficacy 
The  MAH  stated  that  “clinical  trials  carried  out  outside  of  the  European  Union  meet  the  ethical 
requirements  of  Directive  2001/20/EC.”  The  MAH  also  stated  that  “all  trials  were  conducted 
following appropriate Good Clinical Practice standards and considerations for the ethical treatment of 
human subjects that were in place at the time the trials were performed.” 
3.1.1.Main study 
3.1.1.1. Methods 
Study  P051  was  a  24-week,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel-group  Phase  III  study 
comparing the efficacy of sitagliptin 100 mg with placebo in patients with T2DM who had inadequate 
glycaemic  control  on  insulin  therapy  (alone  or  in  combination  with  metformin).  Patients,  age  ≥21 
years,  with  inadequate  glycaemic  control  (A1C  ≥7.5%  and  ≤11.0%)  on  either  pre-mixed  (NPH  and 
regular or short-acting mixture), intermediate- (NPH or Lente), or long-acting (Glargine, Detemir, or 
Ultralente) insulin therapy (and not on routine pre-meal short- or rapid-acting insulin, except as pre-
mixed  insulin  or  if  short-acting  insulin  was  used  <3  times  a  week),  alone  or  in  combination  with 
metformin (at a dose of ≥1500 mg/day), were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either sitagliptin 100 
mg or matching placebo (see Figure 1). Randomization was stratified by 1) use of metformin at Visit 1 
(i.e., on insulin alone, or on insulin in combination with metformin), 2) the patient's use of pre-mixed 
insulin at Visit 1 (i.e., on pre-mixed insulin, or not on pre-mixed insulin), and 3) participation in a 10-
point, frequently sampled, meal tolerance test (MTT), for a total of 8 strata. The proportion of patients 
on  insulin  in  combination  with  metformin  was  capped  at  approximately  75%;  the  proportion  of 
patients on pre-mixed insulin was capped at approximately 25%. 
Dosing regimens for open-label metformin and insulin therapy were to remain stable throughout the 
study period, except if the insulin dose needed to be reduced due to the occurrence, or prevention, of 
hypoglycaemia.  Patients  not  meeting  specific  glycaemic  goals  were  to  receive  rescue  therapy  that 
consisted  of  an  adjustment  of  insulin  dose(s),  based  on  the  investigator’s  clinical  judgment.  Rescue 
therapy was initiated after Visit 3/Day 1 for those patients with FPG level >280 mg/dL (15.6 mmol/L), 
repeated and confirmed within 7 days of the initial elevated value, or at/after Visit 5 for those patients 
with  FPG  >240  mg/dL  (13.3  mmol/L),  repeated  and  confirmed  within  7  days  of  the  initial  elevated 
value.

3.1.1.2. Objectives Study P051 
In  patients  with  T2DM  and  who  have  inadequate  glycaemic  control  (A1C  ≥7.5%  and  ≤11%)  on 
insulin (alone or in combination with metformin): Primary: 1) After 24 weeks to assess the effect of 
sitagliptin addition compared with placebo on HbA1c level. 2) To assess the safety and tolerability of 
sitagliptin.  Secondary:  After  24  weeks  to  assess  the  effect  of  sitagliptin  addition  compared  with 
placebo on 1) HbA1c level in the sub-population of patients on a long-acting or intermediate-acting 
insulin  alone  or  in  combination  with  metformin.  2)  Glycaemic  response  after  a  meal.  3)  Fasting 
Plasma  Glucose  (FPG).  4)  Proportion  patients  achieving  HbA1c  goal  <7%.  5)  Proportion  patients 
achieving  HbA1c  goal  <6.5%.  6)  Glycaemic  efficacy  in  patients  on  insulin  alone,  or  on  insulin  in 
combination  with  metformin.  7)  Body  weight.  8)  In  the  subset  of  patients  who  have  a  frequently 
sampled meal tolerance test, parameters describing pancreatic beta-cell function. 
3.1.1.3. Evaluation Criteria 
Primary efficacy endpoint: change from baseline in HbA1c. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: HbA1c change from baseline in the sub-population of patients on long-
acting  or  intermediate-acting  insulin;  2-hour  post-meal  glucose  (PMG)  after  a  standard  meal 
challenge; fasting plasma glucose (FPG); glucose, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide levels measured 
immediately prior to a standard meal, and at 60 and 120 minutes from the start of the meal; in subsets 
of patients willing to undergo  more extensive blood sampling: glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels 
measured at the following time points relative to the start of the meal: -10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 
180, and 240 minutes, and proinsulin levels measured at 0, 60, and 10 minutes relative to the start of 
the meal; insulin dose; 1,5-anhydroglucitol; and lipid panel. 
Safety  endpoints:  Collection  of  adverse  events,  physical  examinations,  body  weight  and  vital  signs. 
including  blood  chemistry  (including  sodium,  potassium,  chloride, 
Laboratory  assessments 
bicarbonate,  albumin,  uric  acid,  ALT,  AST,  alkaline  phosphatase,  creatinine,  total  bilirubin),  lipid 
panel, haematology (including CBC, differential, absolute neutrophil count), urinalysis and ECG (read 
locally). 
3.1.1.4. Statistical Methods 
The  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  was  the  primary  analysis  population  and  consisted  of  all  patients 
randomized who received at least one study dose, had a baseline measurement, and had at least one 
post-treatment measurement.  
A completers population served as a secondary analysis population and included all patients who had a 
baseline and a Week 24 measurement prior to the initiation of rescue therapy.  
For comparison of continuous efficacy parameters, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was 
used, including treatment, metformin stratum (i.e., on insulin alone, or on insulin and metformin), pre-
mixed insulin stratum, and baseline values. An ordered testing procedure was applied for the primary 
and secondary efficacy hypotheses. 
Data after the initiation of rescue therapy were treated as missing in order to avoid the confounding 
influence of rescue therapy on efficacy comparisons. The primary approach to handling missing data 
was  the last  observation  carried forward (LOCF).  No  missing  data  were imputed  for  the completers 
analysis. 
For the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c goals (<7.0% and <6.5%, respectively) at Week 24, a 
logistic regression model was used adjusting for baseline HbA1c values, metformin stratum, and pre-
mixed insulin stratum. 
A  time-to-rescue  analysis  was  performed  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  and  the  logrank  test. 
Similar  analyses  were  performed  to  compare  time  to  either  rescue  therapy  or  sustained  increase  in 
insulin dose of more than 10%, whichever came first.  
3.1.1.5. Study population 
Twelve hundred and eighty patients were screened, and 641 patients participated in the study at 100 
sites  worldwide.  Of  these  641  randomized  patients,  five  hundred  and  sixty-four  (564)  patients 
completed 24 weeks of treatment (281 in sitagliptin group versus 283 in placebo group).  
 4/20
 
 
 
 
 
 
The number of drop outs was relatively low and similar among treatment groups. More than 90% of 
patients could be included in the primary analysis and more than 80% in the secondary analysis. 
Demographic  and  anthropometric  traits  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  were  generally  similar 
across treatment groups. The study population ranged from 25 to 82 years of age. 
The  MAH  clarified  that  N=81  (25.2%)  and  N=68  (21.3%)  in  the  sitagliptin  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively,  were  older  than  65  years;  only  a  very  small  number  of  patients,  i.e.  N=12  (3.7%)  and 
N=7 (2.2%), respectively, were older than 75 years. 
The  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  provide  further  clarifications  on  the  patient  population  in  study 
P051  and  characteristics  of  the  intended  target  population.  The  MAH  clarified  that  study  P051  was 
designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the addition of sitagliptin to a stable insulin regimen in a 
broad population of patients representative of those who had been maintained by their physicians on a 
stable dose of insulin but who had not achieved A1C treatment targets. Therefore, eligibility required 
that  a  patient  be  on  a  stable  insulin  regimen  for  at  least  10  weeks  prior  to  screening  and  have  a 
screening  A1C  of  7.5%-11.0%.  The  vast  majority  (~75%)  of  patients  had  been  on  a  stable  insulin 
regimen for at least six months. Study P051 was not designed to evaluate patients with T2DM who 
had undergone aggressive titration of insulin, but instead to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the 
addition  of  sitagliptin  to  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  a  stable  regimen  of  insulin  as 
administered  in clinical  practice.  Information  regarding  whether or  not the  patients could  have  been 
titrated to a higher dose of insulin prior to enrollment into the study was not collected. Thus, a separate 
analysis cannot be performed for such patients. 
The MAH acknowledged that further intensification of insulin regimen may be a clinically appropriate 
option for improving glycaemic control in some patients, but it generally involves a more complicated 
regimen consisting of a combination of basal (or intermediate) and pre-prandial short-acting insulin, 
leading to multiple (i.e., 3-4) daily injections and more intensified capillary blood glucose monitoring. 
Moreover, further intensification of insulin regimens can be associated with weight gain and increased 
hypoglycemia. Another treatment approach, commonly used in clinical practice, is the addition of an 
oral antihyperglycaemic agent to a regimen of stable insulin. This was evaluated in study P051.  
The  CHMP  noted  that  due  to  this  design  an  active-comparator  group  in  whom  insulin  dosage  was 
increased was lacking, but patients were on stable dose for at least 10 weeks and most for at least 6 
months,  suggesting  that  further  increase  of  the  insulin  dose  was  not  considered  appropriate  by  the 
treating physician. It is also recognized that maximizing insulin therapy may not always be appropriate 
due to side effects and the complicated dosage regimen. Thus, CHMP considered it not necessary to 
require  another  study  comparing  the  addition  of  sitagliptin  with  that  of  an  increase  in  insulin 
dosage(s). It should also be noted that design of the study is in line with the current guideline on the 
evaluation of medicinal products in the treatment of diabetes mellitus where it is stated that efficacy of 
an  oral  antidiabetic agent in  combination  with  insulin  should  be  documented  vs.  placebo  in  patients 
already  treated  with  insulin  for  a  time  sufficient  to  ensure  stable  HbA1c  levels  (i.e.  at  least  2  to  3 
months).  
The  CHMP,  however,  requested  the  MAH  to  restrict  the  indication  to  the  situation  when  diet  and 
exercise plus “stable” dosage of insulin (i.e. a stable insulin regimen for at least ten weeks) with or 
without metformin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. See further in section 3.6 “Changes to 
the  Product Information” for the exact indication. 
3.1.1.6. Medical history in study population 
Patients participating in this study had the expected high prevalence of medical disorders commonly 
associated  with  T2DM,  such  as  hypertension,  dyslipidaemia,  and  obesity.  Although  patients  with 
unstable medical conditions, such as active liver disease or congestive heart failure (NYHA class II, 
III  or  IV),  were  excluded  from  participation,  patients  with  a  wide  range  of  concurrent  medical 
conditions and concomitant medications were included. Five hundred and ninety-nine (93.4%) of the 
641  randomized  patients  had  at  least  one  medical  history  condition  other  than  T2DM.  Vascular 
disorders  (70.2%  and  66.8%  of  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  and  placebo  groups,  respectively), 
metabolism and nutrition disorders (67.1% and 61.4% of patients in the sitagliptin and placebo groups, 
respectively),  surgical  and  medical  procedures  (35.1%  and  34.2%  of  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  and 
 5/20
 
 
 
 
 
placebo groups, respectively), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (31.7% and 32.9% of 
patients  in  the  sitagliptin  and  placebo  groups,  respectively),  nervous  system  disorders  (30.4%  and 
37.6% of patients in the sitagliptin and placebo groups, respectively), eye disorders (31.1% and 27.3% 
of  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  and  placebo  groups,  respectively)  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (26.7% 
and  21.0%  of  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  and  placebo  groups,  respectively)  were  the    most  common 
categories  by  system  organ  class  (SOC)  of  medical  history.  The  most  common  specific  medical 
history  conditions  were  hypertension,  hyperlipidaemia,  and  dyslipidaemia.  There  were  no  clinically 
important differences among treatment groups in the frequency or type of medical history conditions. 
Elderly  patients  were  allowed  to  participate  in  this  study,  but  no  separate  study  was  performed.  
The  age  of  included  patients  varied  between  25  and  82  years  old.  Children  were  excluded.  Patients 
with  kidney  problems  were  excluded:  Patients  not  on  metformin  therapy  with  serum  creatinine 
concentrations  consistently  ≥1.7  mg/dL  (151  µmol/L)  in  men  and  ≥1.5  mg/dL  (133  µmol/L)  in 
women,  or  estimated  creatinine  clearance  <50  mL/min  (using  the  Cockcroft-Gault  formula)  were 
excluded.  Patients  on  metformin  therapy  with  serum  creatinine  concentrations  ≥1.5  mg/dL  (133 
µmol/L) in men or ≥1.4 mg/dL (124 µmol/L) in women, or estimated creatinine clearance <60 mL/min 
were excluded. 
3.2. Efficacy results  
3.2.1. Haemoglobin A1c (A1C) 
As shown in Table 1 and Figure 2, in both sitagliptin and placebo group there was a modest  reduction 
in  HbA1c level compared to  baseline  [LS  mean  (95%)]  -0.59%  (-0.70,-0.48)  versus  -0.03%  (-0.14,-
0/08)  respectively.  The  reduction  observed  with  the  addition  of  sitagliptin  was  statistically 
significantly greater than that observed with placebo (p<0.001). The profile of change from baseline in 
A1C  over  time  shows  a  greater  reduction  in  A1C  level  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  with  the 
placebo  group  at  all  time  points  measured;  the  between-group  difference  was  maintained  through 
Week 24.

Subgroup Analysis by the Use of Pre-mixed Insulin Stratum 
There were no differences found in changes of HbA1c from baseline in the subgroup analysis for type 
of  insulin.  For  both  patient  groups,  long-acting  or  intermediate-acting  insulin  users,  the  LS  Mean 
decrease  from  baseline  in  A1C  was  significantly  greater  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  with  the 
placebo group (p<0.001). The between-group differences in both insulin strata were almost identical 
(nominal p=0.949 for treatment-by-stratum interaction). 
Subgroup Analysis by the Use of Metformin Stratum 
As shown in Table 2, no differences in changes of HbA1c from baseline were seen between patient on 
metformin  or  not  on  metformin  (nominal  p=0.437  for  treatment-by-stratum  interaction).  For  both

†  Based on ANCOVA model with terms for treatment, metformin stratum, pre-mixed insulin stratum, treatment 
by Metformin Stratum interaction, and baseline A1C as a covariate. 
Patients with higher baseline HbA1c had a greater decrease from baseline in HbA1c than patients with 
lower  baseline  HbA1c  in  both  sitagliptin  and  placebo  groups,  which  was  consistent  with  the 
significant covariate effect of baseline HbA1c in the primary ANCOVA analysis. The between-group 
differences were consistent across the range of baseline HbA1c. 
Study  P051  shows  a  modest,  although  statistically  significant,  reduction  in  HbA1c  level  during  the 
sitagliptin therapy. The best results in HbA1c were seen after 12 weeks. The HbA1c level increased 
slightly after three months in the sitagliptin group. This phenomenon was seen in the placebo group as 
well. These results are similar as was seen in studies previously submitted for other indications. 
Results  from  completers  analyses  were  consistent  with  the  FAS  analyses  except  for  a  somewhat 
smaller  mean  effect  in  the  non-metformin  group  (-0.55%)  compared  to  the  FAS  analysis  (-0.65%). 
Overall,  the  results  suggest  that  the  treatment  effects  (in  terms  of  HbA1c)  are  modest  but  clinically 
relevant and consistent across subgroups. 
Older patients 
The placebo-adjusted mean treatment effects in the elderly (-0.72% and -0.79% in patients >65 y and 
>  75  y,  respectively)  were  similar  to  or  even  larger  than  the  overall  response  (-0.56%),  although, 
patient numbers were small, precluding firm conclusions. Nevertheless, the data do not indicate a lack 
of efficacy in the elderly.

HbA1c Goals 
Table 5 displays Week 24 HbA1c results for the proportions of patients with Week 24 HbA1c values 
below 7.0% (12.8% of patients in the sitagliptin group compared with 5.1% of patients in the placebo 
group). The odds of achieving a Week 24 A1C level <7.0% were significantly higher in the sitagliptin 
group than in the placebo group (p<0.001). 
The  odds  of  achieving  a  HbA1c  level  <6.5%  at  Week  24  were  similar  in  both  groups  in  the  FAS 
population (p=0.584). There were very small numbers of patients who achieved the secondary HbA1c 
goal of <6.5% in both treatment groups: 7/305 (2.3%) in the sitagliptin group versus 6/312 (1.9%) in 
the placebo group, p<0.001.

2.1 mmol/l) and statistically significant with sitagliptin in comparison with adding placebo. However, 
the  2-hour  post-meal  glucose  level  after  24  weeks  of  treatment  with  sitagliptin  is  still  252.0  mg/dl  
(14 mmol/l), which is far from the goal of <10 mmol/l. (180 mg/dl maximum).

The Fasting Plasma Glucose Level dropped in the sitagliptin group. However the amount of reduction 
is small, only about 20 mg/dl (1.1 mmol/l). The reduction in FPG was from 175.8 mg/dl (9.7 mmol/l) 
to 155.1 mg/d (8.6 mmol/l). From a clinical point of view, this (average) reduction in FPG is small and 
not  enough  for  a  proper treatment.  In  some  patients this  reduction  might  be  sufficient,  but  for  most 
people who are already on insulin this improvement is still not enough. 
The  results  of  the  entire  cohort  are  comparable  with  the  results  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  on 
metformin as shown in Table 11.

3.2.4.  Meal Tolerance Test (MTT) 
A significant decrease in glucose total AUC was observed in the sitagliptin group compared with the 
placebo  group  (nominal  p=0.005)  in  a  subset  of  patients  participating  in  10-point  MTT.  Within  the

sitagliptin  group,  a  significant  decrease  from  baseline  in  glucose  total  AUC  was  observed,  and  a 
numerical increase was observed in the placebo group.  
3.2.5.  Indices of Beta cell Function and Insulin Sensitivity 
The  index  of  basal  beta-cell  sensitivity  to  glucose  and  the  index  of  overall  beta-cell  sensitivity  to 
glucose were significantly improved in the sitagliptin group compared to the placebo group (nominal 
p<0.05). There was an increase from baseline in glucose at Week 24 in the sitagliptin group, and the 
95%  CI  for  the  LS  mean  percent  change  from  baseline  excluded  “0”;  there  was  a  decrease  from 
baseline  at  Week  24  in  the  placebo  group,  and  the  95%  CI  for  the  LS  mean  percent  change  from 
baseline excluded “0”. There were no significant between-group differences in the rest of the indices 
of  beta-cell  function  or  insulin  sensitivity  including  dynamic  beta-cell  sensitivity  to  glucose,  delay 
between static phase secretion and glucose concentration, composite index of insulin sensitivity, static 
phase  disposition  index,  dynamic  phase  disposition  index,  overall  phase  disposition  index  or 
insulinogenic index. 
3.2.6. Other Efficacy Endpoints 
There was an increase of fasting C-peptide at Week 24 in the sitagliptin group and a decrease in the 
placebo group; the between-group difference was significant (nominal p<0.001). 
Furthermore, there was an increase of 2-hour post-meal C-peptide at Week 24 with sitagliptin and a 
decrease with placebo. The between-group difference was significant (nominal p<0.001). 
No significant changes in fasting insulin, proinsulin, or proinsulin/insulin ratio were observed in either 
treatment group.  
No significant changes in HOMA-β, index of fasting insulin secretion, or HOMA-IR, an index of 
insulin resistance, were observed in either treatment group. 
3.2.7.  Glycaemic Rescue  
Patients  not  meeting  specific  glycaemic  goals  after  randomization  were  to  have  rescue  therapy 
initiated. There was a small, but no statistically significant difference in need for rescue therapy in the 
sitagliptin group and placebo group. As expected more patients of the placebo group (20/319; 6.3%) 
versus the sitagliptin group (15/322; 4.7%) needed rescue therapy during the 24 week Study. 
3.2.8.  Lipid Panel 
None of the analyses of lipid panel endpoints demonstrated significant between-group differences. 
3.2.9.  Insulin Dosage 
Patients on premixed insulin had a higher mean total daily dose of insulin at baseline (67.4 Units/day 
in  sitagliptin  group  and  74.5  Units/day  in  the  placebo  group)  compared  with  patients  on  long-  or 
intermediate-acting insulin (44.2 Units/day in the sitagliptin group and 44.5 Units/day in the placebo 
group). 
No clinically meaningful changes in the mean total daily dose of insulin for either treatment group or 
by stratum were noted at the end of the study in either treatment group in the entire cohort or in the 
stratum of patients on metformin. 
3.2.10. Metformin Dosage 
The mean dose of metformin was 2010.0 mg per day in the sitagliptin group and 1969.5 mg in the 
placebo group. The mean dose of metformin, as well as the distribution of the doses, was consistent 
between the treatment groups. 
The inclusion of ≥1500 mg/day is consistent with that in previous studies with sitagliptin and other 
HbA1c lowering drugs. 
3.3. Clinical safety 
3.3.1. Patient exposure 
Of  the  641  randomized  patients,  564  completed  24  weeks  of  treatment.  A  similar  proportion  of 
patients  discontinued  from  the  study  in  each  treatment  group.  Reasons  for  discontinuation  were 
generally similar between treatment groups. 
 13/20
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Through  Week  24,  the  mean  duration  of  exposure  was  generally  similar  between  the  2  treatment 
groups, see Table 12. 
Table 12: Patients exposure by Treatment Group 
There were 16 patients in the sitagliptin group and 8 patients in the placebo group who had less than 6 
weeks of exposure to the study medication due to early discontinuations for number of reasons without 
a  discernable  pattern.  The  most  common  reasons  for  early  discontinuations  (i.e.,  within  the  first  6 
weeks) for patients in the sitagliptin group were: deviation from protocol (4 patients), lost to follow-up 
(3  patients),  and  withdrawal  of  consent  (3  patients).  The  most  common  reason  for  early 
discontinuations  (i.e.,  within  the  first  6  weeks)  for  patients  in  the  placebo  group  was  withdrawal  of 
consent (4 patients). 
Table 13 shows the exposure of sitagliptin in the subgroup “patients on metformin”. The mean 
duration of treatment was 161.2 days, this was comparable with the entire study population.  
Table 13: Patients exposure to sitagliptin in the subgroup “patients on metformin” 
3.3.2. Adverse events 
Table 14 gives an overview of the analysis of adverse events during the study. 
Table 14: Analysis of Adverse Events 
 14/20
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adverse events by SOC were reported most frequently for Infections and Infestations, Metabolism and 
Nutrition  Disorders,  Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue  Disorders,  Gastrointestinal  Disorders, 
Nervous System Disorders, and Investigations, see Table 15.  
Table 15: Analysis of specific adverse events 
The  incidence  of  adverse events  grouped  by  SOC  was  generally  comparable  between  two  treatment 
groups.  However,  in  Metabolism  and  Nutrition  Disorders  SOC  and  the  Investigations  SOC,  the 
incidences  of  adverse  events  were  significantly  higher  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  with  the 
placebo group (the 95% CIs for the between-group differences excluded "0"). In the Metabolism and 
Nutrition  Disorders  SOC,  the  higher  incidence  in  the  sitagliptin  relative  to  the  placebo  group  was 
related to a notably higher incidence of the adverse event of hypoglycemia. 
 15/20
 
 
 
 
 
 
Differences between treatment groups in the incidence of specific adverse events were generally small 
(i.e., <2%). With the exception of hypoglycemia, there was no specific adverse event that occurred at a 
higher  rate  in  the  sitagliptin  group  and  for  which  the  95%  CI  excluded  “0”.  The  following  specific 
adverse  events  occurred  with  absolute  incidence  of  >1%  and  with  a  numerically  higher  incidence 
(difference of >3 patients) in the sitagliptin group relative to placebo group: hypoglycemia (see section 
3.4.4 of this report), headache, constipation, creatinine clearance decreased and back pain. 
All of the AEs of headache reported in the sitagliptin group were considered mild (8 of 9) to moderate 
(1 of 9) in intensity and none resulted in the interruption or discontinuation of study medication. Four 
out  of  these  9  events  were  considered  related  to  study  medication.  The  slightly  higher  incidence  of 
headache  in  patients  treated  with  sitagliptin  is  consistent  with  the  results  from  other  randomized 
controlled studies of sitagliptin. 
All  of  the  reported  AEs  of  constipation  in  the  sitagliptin  group  were  mild  in  intensity  and  none 
resulted  in  discontinuation  of  the  study  drug.  Two  out  of  these  6  events  were  considered  by  the 
investigators to be drug-related. 
All of the 5 AEs of decreased creatinine clearance in the sitagliptin group were considered mild (4) or 
moderate (1) in intensity. Two of the 5 events were considered to be drug-related. Three out of these 5 
AEs  led  to  discontinuation;  all  3  of  these  patients  met  the  protocol-specified  criterion  for 
discontinuation due to decreased creatinine clearance. 
Five of the 6 adverse events of back pain reported in the sitagliptin group were considered mild, and 1 
of the 6 was considered moderate in intensity, none were considered drug-related and none resulted in 
the interruption or discontinuation of study medication. 
The  observed  AE  profile  is  generally  in  line  with  what  is  known  about  sitagliptin  from  previous 
studies and is adequately addressed in the SPC. However the CHMP considered the finding of 5 AEs 
of  decreased  creatinine  clearance  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  to  none  in  the  placebo  group 
disturbing,  although  an  association  of  decreased  creatinine  clearance  with  sitagliptin  has  not 
previously been observed. In response to CHMP’s concern, the MAH has provided a comprehensive 
pooled  analysis  including  data  from  12  previous  controlled  clinical  trials.  The  AE  of  “creatinine 
clearance  estimation  decreased”  was  reported  for  31  of  the  3243  patients  (1.0%)  in  the  sitagliptin 
group and 14 of the 2551 patients (0.5%) in the non-exposed group who had the test performed, the 
difference not being statistically significant. Three studies completed after the pooled analysis did not 
indicate an increased frequency of this AE in association with sitagliptin. Although the difference in 
the pooled analysis was not statistically significant and although the somewhat higher frequency of the 
AE  “creatinine  clearance  estimation  decreased”  may  have  been  due  to  chance,  the  CHMP  is  of  the 
opinion that the possible association should be further monitored. Results from the sitagliptin study in 
patients with moderate renal insufficiency are expected in 2011 and may provide further insight into 
this  issue.  According  to  the  RMP  version  2  the  MAH  is  conducting  a  second  study  in  this  regard 
(P073).  
3.3.3. Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
Over the 24-week treatment period, no deaths were reported. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Over the 24-week treatment period, serious adverse events were reported for 20 patients (6.2%) in the 
sitagliptin group and 11 (3.4%) in the placebo group and the 95% CI for the between group difference 
included  “0,”  see  Table  14.  Serious  adverse  events  that  occurred  during  the  study  were  distributed 
among different body systems with no discernable pattern in both treatment groups. 
Among  the  20  patients  in the  sitagliptin  group  with  serious  adverse events, 3  patients  (0.9%)  in  the 
sitagliptin  group  compared  with  none  in  the  placebo  group  had  serious  adverse  events  that  were 
considered by the investigator to be related to study therapy - two patients with drug-related adverse 
events of hypoglycaemia (see section 3.4.4 of this report), and one patient with drug-related adverse 
events  of  leukocytoclastic  vasculitis,  balanoposthitis,  and  genital  abscess.  Acute  infectious 
balanoposthitis  is  known  to  occur  more  frequently  in  patients  with  diabetes.  Leukocytoclastic 
vasculitis  usually  affects  the  skin  and  can  be  induced  by  many  medications.  However,  the  timely 
association  of  this  event  and  the  disappearance  after  discontinuation  of  sitagliptin  makes  a  causal

relationship with sitagliptin likely. The MAH has included cutaneous vasculitis in the RMP version 2 
and into section 4.8 of the SPC. 
Two patients in the sitagliptin group versus non in the placebo group had SAEs of cancer. Due to the 
short  treatment  duration,  the  two  cases  of  cancer  are  highly  unlikely  to  be  causally  related  to 
sitagliptin. However, there is concern about theoretical oncological risks of DPP-IV inhibitors.  
3.3.4. Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation 
Discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  occurred  in  11  (3.4%)  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  group 
compared  with  4  (1.3%)  patients  in  the  placebo  group,  see  Table  14.  Three  patients  (0.9%)  in  the 
sitagliptin group compared with none in the placebo group were discontinued due to an adverse event 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. In two cases, discontinuation was due to a 
serious  drug-related  adverse  event.  One  patient  quit  the  study  due  to  a  serious  drug-related 
leukocytoclastic  vasculitis;  and  one  patient  was  discontinued  due  to  a  serious  drug-related  adverse 
event  of  hypoglycaemia.  The  third  case  was  a  non-serious  drug-related  adverse  event  of  decreased 
creatinine clearance, having met protocol-specified discontinuation criteria. 
3.3.5. Hypoglycaemia 
In  the  study,  a  total  of  75  patients  had  one  or  more  episodes  of  hypoglycaemia.  The  incidence  of 
patients with at least one hypoglycaemic episode was higher in the sitagliptin group than the placebo 
group.  There  were  50  (15.5%)  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  group  with  at  least  one  hypoglycaemic 
episode  compared  with  25  (7.8%)  patients  in  the  placebo  group  (p=0.003  for  between-group 
difference). In the overall cohort, there were 155 episodes of hypoglycaemia reported for patients in 
the sitagliptin group and 76 episodes reported for patients in the placebo group. Most of the episodes 
were mild to moderate in intensity.  
There were 2 episodes (in 2 patients) in the sitagliptin group and 1 episode in the placebo group that 
met  the  protocol-specified  criteria  of  marked  severity  (defined  as  markedly  depressed  level  of 
consciousness,  loss  of  consciousness,  or  seizure)  or  required  medical  assistance.  One  patient  in  the 
sitagliptin group (and none in the placebo group) was discontinued due to the adverse event of severe 
hypoglycemia. 
The  mean  number  of  episodes  among  patients  with  at  least  one  episode  of  hypoglycemia  was  3.1 
(range 1 to 19) in the sitagliptin group and 3.0 (range 1 to 19) in the placebo group. 
Hypoglycaemia was, as expected by the reduction in HbA1c, more common in the sitagliptin group. 
The  number  of  all  episodes  of  hypoglycaemia  was  statistically  significant  higher  in  the  sitagliptin 
group (50/322; 15.5%) versus placebo (25/319, 7.8%) (p=0.003). There were only three patients who 
needed medical assistance for a hypoglycaemia during the 24 week study. Two of these patients were 
in the sitagliptin group. The numbers were too low to notice a difference between the groups. 
Patients with and without hypoglycaemic events did not differ in a relevant manner in most baseline 
characteristics, in particular age or BMI, but did have more frequently better glycaemic control and a 
longer duration of diabetes (13.9 vs. 12.2 years) and insulin use (5.4 vs. 3.5 years). Tighter glycaemic 
control  is  known  to  be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  hypoglycaemia.  In  addition,  risk  of 
hypoglycaemia is also known to increase with decreasing endogenous insulin reserve in patients with 
diabetes. 
The incidence of hypoglycaemic events with sitagliptin in the stratum of patients on metformin was 
similar to that of the entire cohort. 
3.3.6. Vital signs 
No  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  groups  in  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  vital  signs 
(pulse  rate,  temperature,  respiration,  blood  pressure  [diastolic,  systolic,  and  mean  arterial],  waist 
circumference and body mass index [BMI]) were observed in the entire cohort. 
3.3.7. Body Weight 
There was no increase in Body Weight during the 24 week study in either the sitagliptin group (-0.1 
kg) or the placebo group (-0.2 kg). The 95% CI for change in Body weight was small in both groups in 
the entire cohort.

3.3.8. Laboratory findings 
Across  the  laboratory  chemistry  and  haematology  analytes,  the  frequency  of  results  meeting  PDLC 
criteria  was  generally  similar  between  the  sitagliptin  and  the  placebo  groups.  However,  for 
haemoglobin  the  incidence  of  last  value  decrease  ≥1.5  gm/dL  was  higher  in  the  sitagliptin  group 
(6.0%)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (2.1%)  with  a  between-group  difference  of  4.0%  around 
which  the  95%  confidence  internal  excluded  "0,"  see  Table  16.  There  were  no  adverse  events  of 
anaemia  reported  in  the  study,  and  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in  haemoglobin  for  sitagliptin 
compared  with  placebo  was  not  clinically  meaningful.  Additionally,  review  of  laboratory  values, 
medical  history,  and  concomitant  conditions  and  medications  for  individual  patients  with  laboratory 
values  that  met  the  PDLC criteria  for  haemoglobin  decreased  supported the conclusion that the low 
incidence of this generally small change in haemoglobin was unlikely to be clinically meaningful. 
Table 16: Summary of Change from Baseline in Haemoglobin levels 
No  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  mean  values  for  chemistry  analytes  were  observed.  Slight 
between-group differences in mean changes over time were observed for alkaline phosphatase and uric 
acid.  As  in  other  studies  throughout  the  sitagliptin  development  program,  a  slight  decrease  from 
baseline in mean alkaline phosphatase level was observed in the sitagliptin group compared with the 
placebo group (maximum difference of 2.9 IU/L). This decrease was present at Week 6 and remained 
relatively  stable  through  Week  24.  The  between-group  differences  in  mean  changes  were  small  and 
unlikely to be clinically meaningful. No adverse event related to alkaline phosphatase was reported in 
either treatment group. 
As in other studies throughout the sitagliptin development program, a slight increase from baseline in 
mean  uric  acid  levels  was  observed  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group 
(maximum  difference  of  0.2  mg/dL).  This  increase  was  present  at  Week  6,  peaked  at  Week  12  and 
decreased slightly through Week 24. The between group differences in mean changes were small and 
unlikely to be clinically meaningful. 
Three  adverse  events  of  gout  were  reported  for  1  patient  in  the  sitagliptin  treatment  group  and  2 
patients in the placebo group; in addition, the adverse experience of gouty arthritis was reported for 
zero patients in the sitagliptin group and for one patient in the placebo group. 
Seven patients in the sitagliptin group and 2 patients in the placebo group had laboratory values that 
met the pre-defined limits of change criterion for serum creatinine (last value >/= 0.3 mg/dL greater 
than baseline).  
3.4  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH did submit an updated RMP (version 2) in May 2009, shortly after the submission of this 
type  II  variation.  The  RMP  version  2  includes  assessment  of  the  data  available  from  study  P051.  
The  assessment  of  the  RMP  version  2  has  been  completed  in  August  2009  and  Annex  II  has  been 
updated in this type II variation to reflect this version number. A further updated RMP version will be 
submitted  by  the  MAH  on  the  1  of  December  2009.  As  a  consequence  an  updated  RMP  was  not 
submitted as part of this type II variation to extend the indication.

Changes to the Product Information 
The CHMP requested the MAH to restrict the indication to the situation when diet and exercise plus 
“stable”  dosage  of  insulin  (i.e.  a  stable  insulin  regimen  for  at  least  ten  weeks)  with  or  without 
metformin do not provide adequate glycaemic control.  
The MAH proposed to change the indication in section 4.1 of the SPC as follows: “Januvia is also 
indicated as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and exercise plus stable dosage 
of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control.” This was accepted by the CHMP. 
In  addition  the  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  reflect  in  section  5.1  of  the  SPC  the  specific  clinical 
situation  described  in  study  P051.  The  agreed  wording  in  section  5.1  reads  as  follows:  “A  24-week 
placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin (100 mg once 
daily) added to insulin (at a stable dose for at least 10 weeks) with or without metformin (at least 1500 
mg). In patients taking pre-mixed insulin, the mean daily dose was 70.9 U/day. In patients taking non-
pre-mixed  (intermediate/long-acting)  insulin,  the  mean  daily  dose  was  44.3  U/day.  The  addition  of 
sitagliptin  to  insulin  provided  significant  improvements  in  glycaemic  parameters.  There  was  no 
meaningful change from baseline in body weight in either group.” 
As a result of the new indication and to reflect data from study P051 further changes were made to 
sections  4.1  (re-arrangement  of  text),  4.2,  4.4,  4.8,  5.1.  The  Package  Leaflet  has  been  updated 
accordingly.  
Also minor corrections were made in sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SPC. 
In addition the MAH took the opportunity to update the version number of the RMP in annex II.

Overall conclusion and Benefit-Risk Assessment 
In support of the extension of the indication, results of one clinical trial were submitted. Study P051 
was  a  24-week  multicenter,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  phase  III 
study to compare the efficacy and safety of addition of sitagliptin 100 mg in T2DM patients who were 
already  on  stable  insulin  treatment,  specified  as  either  pre-mix  or  long-acting  insulin  with  stable 
dosage for a minimum of 10 weeks prior randomization and with metformin (at least 1500 mg/day, in 
stable  dosage)  or  without  metformin  therapy.  Patients  with  HbA1c  levels  between  7.5%  and  11.0% 
(inclusive) were included. The majority (75%) of the participating patients used open-label metformin 
(mean dose 2000 mg). The studied population is, based on the baseline characteristics, expected to be 
representative of patients with T2DM.  
This trial was designed to evaluate the effect of sitagliptin addition on top of insulin treatment with or 
without  metformin.  Due  to  this  design  an  active-comparator  group  in  whom  insulin  dosage  was 
increased was lacking, but patients were on a stable dose for at least 10 weeks and most for at least 6 
months,  suggesting  that  further  increase  of  the  insulin  dose  was  not  considered  appropriate  by  the 
treating physician. This is in line with the current guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products in 
the  treatment  of  diabetes  mellitus    It  is  also  recognized  that  maximizing  insulin  therapy  may  not 
always  be  appropriate  due  to  side  effects  and  the  complicated  dosage  regimen.  Thus,  CHMP 
considered it not necessary to require another study comparing the addition of sitagliptin with that of 
an increase in insulin dosage(s).   
Benefits 
In  study  P051,  sitagliptin  as  add-on  therapy  in  patients  with  inadequate  control  on  stable  dosage  of 
insulin and with or without stable dosage of metformin provided a modest, but statistically significant 
improvement  in  glycaemic  control  compared  with  placebo.  The  HbA1c  level  decreased  in  the 
sitagliptin group [LS mean change in HbA1c (%) (95% CI)]  -0.59 (-0.70,-0.48) versus -0.03 (-0.14, 
0.08)  in  control  group.  The  reduction  observed  with  the  addition  of  sitagliptin  was  statistically 
significantly greater than that observed with placebo (p<0.001). The size of effect in HbA1c reduction 
is  in  line  with  other  trials  with  sitagliptin.  The  best  results  in  HbA1c  were  seen  after  12  weeks.  
The HbA1c level increased slightly after three months in the sitagliptin group. This phenomenon was 
seen  in  the  placebo  group  as  well.  Analysis  of  secondary  parameters  confirmed  these  results.  The 
efficacy was present both in patients with and without concomitant therapy with metformin. The data 
 19/20
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
did not indicate a lack of efficacy in the elderly, although only a very small number of patients was 
older than 75 years. 
Risks 
The  safety  profile  observed  in  study  P051  is  generally  in  line  with  what  is  known  about  sitagliptin 
from previous studies. The observed ADRs are adequately addressed in the SPC. Hypoglycaemia was, 
as  expected  by  the  reduction  in  HbA1c,  more  common  in  the  sitagliptin  group.  The  number  of  all 
episodes of hypoglycaemia was statistically significant higher in the sitagliptin group (50/322; 15.5%) 
versus 
patients  
(2  sitagliptin,  1  placebo)  who  needed  medical  assistance  for  a  hypoglycaemia  during  the  24  week 
study.  Most  cases  of  hypoglycaemia  were  mild.  Patients  with  hypoglycaemic  events  had  more 
frequently better glycaemic control and a longer duration of diabetes (13.9 vs. 12.2 years) and insulin 
use (5.4 vs. 3.5 years), as is known to be associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.

There were 5 cases of decreased creatinin clearance in the sitagliptin group. A comprehensive pooled 
analysis by the MAH of studies with sitagliptin did not indicate a statistically increased frequency of 
this  AE  in  association  with  sitagliptin,  but  its  incidence  was  slightly  increased  and  the  possible 
association should be further monitored. Results from the sitagliptin study in patients with moderate 
renal insufficiency are expected in 2011 and a second study is underway. The MAH should indicate in 
the next PSUR when the results of this study can be expected. 
One  case  of  leukocytoclastic  vasculitis  was  reported,  which  appears  likely  related  to  sitagliptin.  
The  MAH  has  already  included  cutaneous  vasculitis  in  the  RMP  and  into  section  4.8  of  the  SPC 
through a recent type II variation.  
Balance 
The  addition  of  sitagliptin  to  insulin  (with  or  without  metformin)  resulted  in  a  modest  statistically 
significant  improvement  of  glycaemic  control  with  no  unexpected  adverse  events.Therefore,  the 
CHMP  recommends  to  extend  the  indication  for  Januvia  as  add-on  to  insulin  (with  or  without 
metformin) when diet and exercise plus stable dosage of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic 
control.

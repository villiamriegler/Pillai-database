Assessment report

2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
VWD is one of the most common inherited bleeding disorders with an estimated global prevalence of 13,000 
to 16,000 cases per million population thus affecting approximately 1-2% of the population. The estimated 
global incidence of VWD is 100 cases per million population (Rodghiero et al). The majority of cases (70-
80%) are due to partial quantitative von Willebrand Factor (VWF) deficiency (Type 1 VWD). The most severe 
form of VWD, i.e. severe Type 3 VWD, has a much lower prevalence ranging from 0.1 to 5.3 cases per 
million population (0.00001-0.00053%) and an incidence of approximately 1 case per million population 
(Castaman et al.). According to a report of the World Federation of Haemophilia from 2008, the prevalence 
was 0.48/10000 (0.0048%) as estimated by a survey sent to National registries thus only including 
identified VWD patients. There is additional evidence, that VWD can also be acquired, however, this occurs 
very rarely and primarily in older adults with only 700 cases reported worldwide. Comparative data as 
determined by population screening suggest that the prevalence of inherited VWD is globally similar among 
populations. Mean levels of VWF have been reported to be influenced by blood type, with levels 25% lower in 
persons of blood type 0 as compared to other types. VWD is evenly distributed by gender, however, females 
with increasing age and development a more prone to be symptomatic due to menarche and childbirth. 
With regards to morbidity, epistaxis and menorrhagia are the most common manifestations of VWD. 
Bleeding subsequently to surgery, childbirth or accidental trauma is also a common symptom. 
Gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings occur less frequently, however are often very serious. Subjects with severe 
VWD often suffer from joint or soft tissue bleedings which may cause chronic musculoskeletal damage and 
joint replacement surgery, in particular if treatment was inadequate over time. Menorrhagia is a frequent 
(50-60% as compared to 9-14% in healthy females) event and often the first sign of VWD in females. 
Pregnancy can be carried to term in most affected females but bleeding events (BEs) and other 
complications during pregnancy and childbirth result in a maternal mortality rate 10 times higher than that 
for other women.  
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
VWF is a large multimeric glycoprotein with haemostatic function and is normally found in blood plasma, 
alphagranules of thrombocytes and Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells. VWF is involved in haemostasis 
by mediating adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium and platelet-platelet interactions. It also functions 
as a stabilising carrier molecule of procoagulant Factor VIII (FVIII), an essential cofactor of secondary 
haemostasis that leads to the fibrin clot formation, and facilitates platelet adhesion to subendothelium at 
sites of vascular injury. 
Qualitative and/or quantitative deficiency of VWF leads to von Willebrand Disease (VWD), which is the most 
common inherited bleeding disorder. It can be categorised in 3 Types as follows: 
• 
• 
Type 1 VWD is characterised by a partial quantitative (heterozygous) deficiency of VWF and accounts 
for approximately 70% of VWD patients. It is mostly induced by missense mutations causing various 
effects including abnormal transcription, subcellular storage and secretion and accelerated clearance. 
Type 2 VWD accounts for about 20 to 30% of patients and is caused by a qualitative abnormality. 
There are four subtypes that can be distinguished, i.e. 2A, 2B, 2M and 2N, and underlying mutations 
variously affect VWF multimer assembly and proteolysis, VWF dependent platelet adhesion, or the 
FVIII binding site. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 9/113 
  
  
• 
Type 3 VWD accounts for 1 to 5% of VWD patients and is characterised by a total or near total 
(homozygous) deficiency of VWF and subsequently also by very low levels of FVIII (<10 IU/dL). 
Type 3 VWD causing mutations include large deletions within the VWF gene as well as missense 
mutations that prevent VWF biosynthesis or secretion. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis prognosis 
VWD patients are at increased risk for bleeding and typical symptoms associated with VWD include easy 
bruising, epistaxis, menorrhagia, and extended bleedings after injury or surgical procedures. Typical 
bleeding locations include mucosal tissues, muscles and joints. Severity of bleeding diathesis and thus 
prognosis correlate with VWD type and bleeding location. Type 1 VWD patients are often asymptomatic or 
have only mild symptoms. Bleeding diathesis is usually moderate in Type 2 VWD patients and often affects 
mucosal tissues. Type 3 VWD is the most severe form which is associated with severe haemorrhagic 
symptoms including bleeding in mucosal and GI tissues, muscles, and joints. Life-threatening bleedings 
including GI bleedings or haemorrhages of the central nervous system can occur in Type 3 VWD patients, 
while affecting only some Type 2 VWD patients and are rarely found in Type 1 VWD. Diagnosis of VWD can 
be challenging, in particular due to mild signs and symptoms of most VWD patients. However, early 
diagnosis is important to ensure normal or near normal quality of life and to prevent acute and chronic tissue 
damage. VWD is diagnosed by evaluation of medical history, checking for bruises and other signs of recent 
bleeding, and haematologic laboratory assessment.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Treatment of VWD depends on type and severity and therapeutic response aims for correction of abnormal 
coagulation expressed by low levels of FVIII and of abnormal platelet adhesion expressed by prolonged 
bleeding time (Mannucci et al). Desmopressin, a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone 
vasopressin, is commonly used in milder forms (Type 1 VWD and some subtypes of Type 2) to release 
endogenous VWF and available as infusion or nasal spray. Another type of medicines in VWD therapy are 
antifibrinolytics such as aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid often used in the treatment of BEs occurring 
after minor surgery such as tooth extraction or after minor trauma. Antifibrinolytics may be used alone or 
with desmopressin and replacement therapy.  
Patients that cannot take desmopressin or need extended treatment, that have Type 1 VWD unresponsive to 
desmopressin, or have Type 2 or 3 VWD receive VWF replacement therapy. Currently, plasma-derived VWF 
(pdVWF) products that contain both VWF and FVIII are used in the management of episodic bleeding, and 
surgical procedures.  
About the product 
Veyvondi is a recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF) with the active substance vonicog alfa (product 
class: blood coagulation factors, ATC code: B02BD10) and intended use for VWF replacement therapy in 
VWD patients. The Final Drug Product (FDP) consists of a lyophilised powder for solution for injection, sterile 
water for reconstitution and a reconstitution device (Mix2Vial Device). The proposed nominal dosage 
strengths are 650, and 1300 IU/vial. Each dosage strength is reconstituted using Sterile Water for Injection 
and mixed gently prior to intravenous injection. Dosage and frequency of Veyvondi are to be individualised 
according to clinical judgement and based on the subject’s weight, type and severity of the bleeding 
episodes/surgical intervention and based on monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is a large multimeric glycoprotein that is normally found in plasma, alpha-
granules of platelets and intracellular organelles known as the Weibel-Palade bodies. The multimers of VWF 
range in molecular weight from 500 to > 20,000 kDa. VWF facilitates platelet adhesion to sub-endothelium 
at sites of vascular injury during primary haemostasis and serves as the carrier molecule for Factor VIII, 
which is an essential cofactor of secondary haemostasis that leads to the fibrin clot formation. 
Veyvondi is a recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF) with the active substance vonicog alfa. The finished 
product (FP) consists of a lyophilized powder for solution for injection, sterile water for reconstitution and a 
CE-marked Mix2Vial reconstitution device. The proposed nominal dosage strengths are 650, and 1300 
IU/vial. Each dosage strength is reconstituted using Sterile Water for Injections (sWFI) and mixed gently 
prior to intravenous injection. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF) is co-expressed with recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells as part of the ADVATE (Centrally authorised product) manufacturing process. The 
rVWF protein is separated from the FVIII and further purified. 
Structural formula 
Vonicog alfa is expressed as a 2813 amino acid pro-VWF molecule. The pro-VWF is composed of A, B, C and 
D repeats, which contain various functional domains that have been identified. The mature VWF monomer is 
a 2050 amino acid protein. Every monomer contains a number of specific domains with a specific function. 
Elements of note are: 
The A1 domain, which binds to: Platelet gp1b-receptor, Heparin, Collagen 
The D’/D3 domain, which binds to Factor VIII 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  The "cysteine knot" domain 
The A3 domain, which binds to collagen 
The C1 domain, in which the RGD domain binds to platelet integrin αIIbβ3 when this is activated 
Monomers of pro-VWF are subsequently N-glycosylated, arranged into dimers via a C-terminal disulfide bond 
in the endoplasmic reticulum and into multimers by crosslinking of N-terminal cysteine residues via disulfide 
bonds.

After reduction of disulfide bonds in electrophoretic analysis, rVWF appears as a single predominant band 
having an apparent molecular weight of approximately 260 kDa. In low resolution agarose gel 
electrophoresis, rVWF shows a characteristic ladder of bands also known as multimers. In this analysis, rVWF 
contains as many distinct bands as VWF detectable in normal human plasma or VWF isolated from human 
plasma but in addition, has a zone with unresolved bands in the ultra-high molecular weight range. High-
resolution electrophoresis shows a single band for all multimer levels without any satellite bands, as rVWF 
has never been exposed to ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 
motif, member 13) cleavage. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacture of the active substance is divided into an upstream cell culture process (USP) and a 
downstream purification process (DSP). The USP consists of cell expansion, production, harvest, and harvest 
capture. This process is identical to the upstream process of ADVATE (recombinant human Factor VIII) that 
was approved by EMA in 2004 (EMA procedure number EMA/H/C/520). The ADVATE cell line [GD8/6 
(Hayward ID number 9710)] co-expresses recombinant human Factor VIII (rFVIII) and recombinant human 
VWF (rVWF). In order to improve efficiency and viral safety of the process, media are nanofiltered before use 
in the process. Recombinant VWF active substance is purified from the flow through fraction (effluent) of the 
MAb immune-affinity purification column used in the manufacture of ADVATE active substance. 
The rVWF downstream purification process has been implemented at two sites, the Austrian facility at pilot 
scale and clinical scale; and at the facility in Switzerland at commercial scale (MAB effluent from the scaled-
up cell culture volume). Comparability of the two downstream processes has been demonstrated by 
respective process development and validation data.  
The processes at both sites are identical except the scale-up and some facility and scale fit adaptations at 
the Switzerland facility. The same control strategy and acceptance criteria are applicable. For the 
manufacture of commercial finished product only active substance from the downstream manufacturing site 
in Switzerland will be used. The Austrian facility was withdrawn as a commercial manufacturing site; it only 
functions as QC testing site. 
Control of materials 
FVIII/VvWF: The cell line used for the production of rFVIII and rVWF is a genetically engineered CHO cell 
line, which grows without additives of human or animal origin. This cell bank has been approved in the EU 
for the production of rFVIII (ADVATE) and its genetic stability has been adequately confirmed. Based on high 
levels of expression of both Factor VIII and vWF, a single clonal cell line was chosen. The production of the 
transgenic CHO cell line and the generation and characterisation of the master and working cell banks is 
described in line with ICH Q5B and 5D. 
Furin: The information presented for the manufacture of the rFurin is comprehensive and indicates that the 
cell substrate and expression construct have been characterized in line with ICH Q5B and Q5D. The 
recombinant protein is produced in a validated manufacturing process which is under a state of control. The 
rFurin is adequately characterized with respect to primary, secondary and higher order structure and 
impurities.  
Anti-FVIII MAb: A summary description has been also presented for the production of the monoclonal 
antibodies used as capturing antibodies in the FVIII immune-affinity step. This antibody is expressed from a

cell bank and further purified and finally coupled to the chromatography resin. The entire process has been 
approved during the ADVATE licensing process. As the Veyvondi rVWF dossier is a self-standing dossier, a 
summary description of the manufacture, control and stability for the MAb antibody and its coupling to the 
chromatography resin have been included in the Veyvondi dossier for completeness. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) and Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) have been defined and are 
maintained in the Risk Management System. A list of in-process control (IPC) parameters that will be 
monitored routinely in the upstream and downstream manufacturing process of rVWF has been provided. 
Based on the details presented in the manufacturing process development section and experience gained 
during process validation, the set of IPCs and their acceptance criteria as presented are considered adequate 
and in line with ICH Q6B and the Guideline on process validation (EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014). The 
process has been sufficiently described and in-process controls are sufficient to control the process. 
Process validation 
The validation of the manufacturing process was performed in line with ICH Q11 and the Guideline on 
process validation EMA/CHMP/BWQP/18338/2014. The Applicant applied a risk-based approach to process 
development and validation. Initially, the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) was defined (including quality 
attributes, product and process related impurities). The quality attributes were assessed for criticality in a 
Risk Assessment and Control Table based on potential impact on patient safety and efficacy. The correlation 
between process steps and CQAs was assessed in a Process Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (PFMEA). The 
outcome of the PFMEA was used to design both the characterization and process performance qualification 
(PPQ) studies to support the design of the control strategy, including definition of proven acceptable ranges 
(PARs), normal operating ranges (NORs) and IPCs, and to confirm the established control strategy. 
The process was developed on small scale, scaled-up to commercial scale at the Austrian facility and was 
validated. In order to meet future market demands, the purification process was transferred from the 
Austrian facility to the Switzerland facility.  
The consistency and robustness of the commercial scale manufacturing was demonstrated through a PPQ. All 
routine testing parameters for active substance release were measured against predefined acceptance 
criteria. The results from the rVWF PPQ showed that the rVWF upstream and the downstream processes at 
either site can reproducibly manufacture active substance meeting its predefined quality attributes. It was 
also demonstrated that active substance batches from both manufacturing sites are highly comparable with 
respect to release parameters and additional biochemical attributes. The life-cycle of the process is managed 
through a Continued Process Verification (CPV) program.  
Process validation support studies demonstrated adequate establishment of operating parameters at 
different mixing steps.  
Lifecycle validation studies evaluated, in an ongoing protocol, the acceptable re-use cycles for 
chromatography resins and membranes. These are defined for both the process in the Austrian facility and 
the process in the facility in Switzerland. As an open protocol is applied, the currently acceptable maximum 
cycle numbers may be extended.

Manufacturing process development  
An extensive comparability exercise in line with ICH Q5E, ICH Q11 and the Guideline on process validation 
EMA/CHMP/BWQP/18338/2014 has been performed for active substance lots manufactured at different 
manufacturing sites. Process development and process validation data, as well as batch release data 
provided sufficient evidence that the active substance from the two different manufacturing sites can be 
considered comparable. Site-specific process/equipment adaptations have been justified and are acceptable.  
In Q3 2017, the Applicant voluntarily stopped the manufacture of rVWF active substance at the location in 
Austria, and this facility is no longer listed as an active substance manufacturing site for the commercial 
process. Its function as a QC testing laboratory for rVWF will be maintained.  
Characterisation 
In line with ICH Q5E, Note for guidance on Comparability and ICH Q6B, Note for Guidance on Specifications, 
the applicant has conducted an extensive physicochemical and biological characterisation of rVWF from the 
various stages of the process development, including material after implementation of changes to the 
upstream process and a longest process time batch to cover worst case process time. Although not all 
characterisation tests have been applied to samples from all stages of development, the overall analysis 
reveals that commercial scale rVWF finished product batches show consistent characteristics which are 
comparable to active substance batches from different development stages. 
The most detailed impurity testing was performed with earlier pilot scale batches, a reduced set of testing 
was applied to later stage active substance batches, including testing for those impurities that are repeatedly 
seen (here rFVIII) or which are considered most critical (like oxidised forms of rVWF). 
The analysis of potential product and process-related impurities has been performed in line with ICH Q6B. 
The results indicate that active substance of the different stages of product development show a consistent 
low level of process-and product-related impurities.  
Specification 
The active substance specification contains tests for appearance, identity, potency and purity. In general, 
the active substance release specifications have been established in line with ICH Q6B and are acceptable. 
Specifications are based on process capability, historical data, clinical experience and pharmacopoeial 
requirements. The active substance is controlled by test methods validated in line with ICH Q2(R1).  
Stability 
The applicant proposes a shelf life for the active substance of 36 months when stored at ≤ -60 °C, and a 
storage time of the intermediate MAB Effluent prior to downstream processing of 84 days (12 weeks) at 
+5 °C ± 3 °C. In support of these storage conditions stability studies in line with ICH Q5C were conducted. 
The stability study included material of the current commercial scale manufacturing process. Data from real 
time/real temperature, from accelerated and from forced degradation studies of the active substance and 
Assessment report

MAB Effluent demonstrate that the proposed storage conditions do not affect the quality, safety and efficacy 
of the product. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Veyvondi finished product (FP) is a lyophilisate of purified recombinant human von Willebrand factor (rVWF) 
(vonicog alfa). The excipients present are sodium citrate, mannitol, trehalose dihydrate, glycine and 
polysorbate 80. The product is supplied in single-dose glass vials containing either 650 International Units 
(IU) VWF Ristocetin Cofactor activity (VWF:RCo) per vial or 1300 IU VWF:RCo/vial. Each dosage strength is 
reconstituted using sterile Water for Injections (sWFI) prior to intravenous injection. The product has a final 
concentration of 130 IU/mL after reconstitution of both presentations (the 650 IU/vial reconstituted with 5 
mL water for injection and the 1300 IU/vial reconstituted with 10 mL water for injection). 
The specific activity of Veyvondi is approximately 110 IU VWF:RCo/mg protein.  
The finished product is packed with a CE-marked needle-less transfer device (Mix2Vial) containing an 
integrated 20 µm in-line filter for filtration of the product prior to administration.  
Pharmaceutical Development 
In accordance with the requirements of ICH Q8(R2), physicochemical and biological properties of the active 
substance that can influence the performance of the finished product and its manufacturability (e.g. 
undergoing structural changes upon exposure to shear stress) have been identified and presented. 
Formulation development 
Recombinant VWF is a large multimeric glycoprotein tending to form aggregates under stressed conditions. 
Based on the results of shaking, freeze-thaw, lyophilisation and stability experiments using rVWF final 
finished product reconstituted in a series of different formulations to simulate stressed conditions, a 
concluding formulation has been established. This formulation has remained unchanged during manufacture 
of non-clinical, clinical and commercial scale rVWF FDP batches.  
Manufacturing process development 
According to ICH Q8(R2), process development of rVWF FP has been based on the Target Development 
Profile of the product defining the quality attributes of the product. Assessment of the severity and 
probability of quality attributes on patient harm by means of risk analysis has resulted in the identification of 
CQAs. Using PFMEA, the impact of process parameters on product quality attributes was evaluated. Resulting 
from PFMEA and supported by data generated during process development, critical process parameters were 
identified that are monitored or controlled to ensure that the product is of the desired quality.  
Sterile filtration step 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 15/113 
  
  
 
 
 
The inherent characteristic of VWF to uncoil and form long filaments under shear stress increases the risk of 
filter clogging. A cellulose acetate filter has demonstrated optimal performance with respect to filterability 
and capacity. Furthermore, to ensure filtration robustness, a new filtration concept was introduced by 
expanding the filter area in relation to the batch size.  
Process characterisation (robustness) 
A designed experimental approach (DoE) was utilised for the overall robustness study (VWF0019T) of the 
process to evaluate influence of the variation of several process parameters on selected product attributes of 
rVWF FDP (650 IU). This dosage strength has a higher surface to volume ratio than rVWF FDP 1300 IU and 
is considered as worst case condition. The process inputs were based on evaluating the influence of six 
formulation parameters and three lyophilisation settings on the chosen quality attributes (outputs) of rVWF 
finished product. The analytical results of the output parameters were analysed and a process capability 
analysis of the investigated quality attributes performed confirming robustness of the process within the 
evaluated parameter variations.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Description of the manufacturing process 
Manufacture of the finished product comprises thawing of the formulated active substance, pooling, dilution 
in formulation buffer to final potency (130 IU/mL), sterile filtration, aseptic filling, lyophilisation and capping 
of the stoppered vials 
The description of the manufacturing process of the final finished product of rVWF vonicog alfa has been 
provided in sufficient detail. Manufacturing flow diagrams including critical process steps and in-process 
controls have been provided.  
Controls of Critical Steps and Intermediates  
In-process controls 
Adequate IPCs have been established for the critical steps identified to control manufacture of rVWF final 
finished product. 
Process Validation and/or Evaluation 
Process validation of the rVWF FP manufacturing process has been based on the following activities 
performed throughout the lifecycle of the product:  
1) Process Development  
2a) PPQ studies were performed on several PPQ finished product batches. Results of critical process 
parameters and in-process controls were within the normal operating ranges and specified limits, 
demonstrating that the process was reproducibly controlled at the individual final finished product processing 
steps.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 16/113 
  
  
 
 
Results of release testing of PPQ batches demonstrated the reproducibility of the finished product 
manufacturing process to produce final product meeting predefined product specifications. 
2b) Process Support Qualification was performed to confirm the adequacy of controls for quality attributes 
and process parameters not covered by routine in-process controls or release tests.  
2c) Shipping Validation studies have been provided for the transport of rVWF active substance and for the 
transport of final unlabelled vials (FUVs), for labelling and packaging.  
3) Continued Process Verification is performed to have continual assurance that the process remains in a 
state of control (the validated state) during commercial manufacture 
A Quality Product Review (QPR) has been conducted including statistical analysis to evaluate process 
performance and discuss and analyse trends. 
Taken together, the results demonstrate product quality, robust process performance, process consistency, 
and reproducibility. 
Overall, based on the process validation data presented the process is considered suitable for consistent 
manufacturing of rVWF finished product. 
Control of excipients 
Excipients selected for Veyvondi FP are of Ph. Eur. quality. None of the excipients in rVWF finished product 
are of human or animal origin. There are no novel excipients used in the manufacture of rVWF FP. All 
excipients used are well-known ingredients.  
Product specification 
Specification testing proposed for rVWF FP batch release includes a potency assay, assays regarding the 
parameter “identity/purity”, tests with respect to safety as well as general tests. 
The specifications established for rVWF FP batch release comprising of a panel of analytical test methods 
with defined test limits (acceptance criteria) are considered to be adequate.  
Analytical procedures  
Potency assay: Determination of Von Willebrand Factor:Ristocetin Cofactor Activity (VWF:RCo) according to 
Ph. Eur. 2.7.21 is used as potency assay for Veyvondi rVWF FP. Ristocetin cofactor activity of rVWF is 
determined by measuring agglutination of a suspension of platelets in the presence of ristocetin.  
Recombinant von Willebrand Factor FP is a purified, freeze-dried medicinal product for which no defined 
monograph is available in the European Pharmacopoeia. Monograph 07/2013:2298 established for plasma-
derived von Willebrand Factor in Ph. Eur. requires the human VWF activity to be determined by the ristocetin 
cofactor activity and by one or more suitable assays such as determination of collagen-binding activity using 
a suitable reference preparation. The applicant has used the collagen-binding assay (Ph. Eur. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 17/113 
  
  
 
 
 
01/2008:20721) to additionally characterise the biological activity of rVWF active substance and finished 
product batches as adequately described in the dossier.  
Suitable descriptions of the analytical procedures and the respective control test procedure (CTP) have been 
provided. Validation studies demonstrate that the analytical methods used at FP batch release are suitable 
for their intended purpose.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis of final finished product lots produced from active substance manufactured at both Baxalta 
facilities including batch numbers, date of production, and manufacturing information for relevant FP lots 
have been presented in tabular form. 
Statistical analysis was conducted for specification setting of quantitative analytical methods.  
Results for the parameters tested comply with the specification for rVWF FDP effective at the time of 
production of conformance lots. Overall, batch analysis data demonstrates batch-to-batch consistency.  
Reference standards or materials  
Product-specific secondary (working, in-house) standard Lot HN4AR calibrated against the international 
standard for VWF, concentrate (WHO #09/182) has been established as i) rVWF in-house reference standard 
for VWF:RCo Activity and ADAMTS-13 Cleavage assays as well as ii) in-house reference material for N-
Glycan and VWF Multimer Analysis assays.  
Concluding, in-house reference standard HN4AR was shown to be suitable for its intended use as reference 
standard for VWF:RCo Activity. 
Container Closure 
Primary packaging for rVWF FP 650 IU consists of 10 mL Type 1 borosilicate glass vial 10R stoppered with 
butyl rubber (IIR) and Aluminium cap with polypropylene disk (white).  
Primary packaging for rVWF FP 1300 IU consists of 30 mL Type 1 borosilicate glass vial with the same 
stopper and crimp cap as rVWF 650 IU dosage strength.  
Representative Certificates of Analyses for each container closure component have been presented.  
Safety profiles of the rVWF final finished product container closure systems have been confirmed by 
compendial and additional testing of glass vial, stopper and the whole configuration including delamination 
and extractables studies as well as functionality testing.  
Functionality testing demonstrated that the container-closure system constitutes an effective microbial 
barrier. Media fills simulating the manufacturing process confirm aseptic manufacture of the rVWF BDP filling 
and lyophilisation process using the proposed container closure system.  
Overall, primary packaging for both potencies of rVWF (650 IU and 1300 IU) conforms to current Ph. Eur. 
requirements and is considered to be suitable for the intended use.

Stability of the product 
Long-term stability 
Stability studies conducted on rVWF finished product included forced degradation studies to evaluate stability 
indicating parameters as well as formal stability studies to assess stability of lyophilised and reconstituted FP 
batches representing both strengths manufactured at commercial scale. Forced degradation studies 
confirmed the main stability indicating parameters are the VWF:RCo activity and the VWF multimer assay 
which are both able to detect changes for all employed stress conditions that had a significant impact on the 
quality of rVWF FP. Additionally, the FVIII binding assay has proven to have stability indicating capabilities 
similar to the VWF:RCo assay.  
Stability studies were performed according to current guidelines. Primary packaging used during stability 
studies is intended for commercial production. The parameters used to monitor the stability of rVWF FDP 
were selected to measure potency, identity, purity, general quality as well as safety of the finished product. 
An appropriate rationale for their use has been provided in tabular form. The stability specification is based 
on the product specification.  
Overall, real-time/real-temperature stability data from 5 rVWF FP batches of each strength manufactured 
from active substance lots covering at least 36 months storage at 30±2 °C/65% RH support the claimed 
shelf life for the finished product of 3 years when stored at up to 30 °C.  
Stability after reconstitution  
Real-time stability data provided for reconstituted rVWF FP batches manufactured at the Austrian facility (3 
batches of 650 IU and 6 batches of 1300 IU strength) covering 24 hours of the reconstituted product at 
room temperature (25 °C) at the start and the end of shelf life comply with the acceptance criteria. 
Furthermore, real-time stability data covering 24 hours at 25 °C available for 5 rVWF FP batches 
(manufactured from active substance processed at the facility in Switzerland) after reconstitution at the start 
of the shelf life meet the specification.  
The SmPC states that chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 3 hours at 25 °C. 
Use reconstituted product within 3 hours. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility 
of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8 °C, unless reconstitution has taken 
place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. The in-use shelf life claim is acceptable.  
Sterilised Water for Injections (sWFI, Diluent) 
The diluent for reconstitution of lyophilised rVWF FP is sterilised Water for Injections (sWFI) complying with 
the requirements of Ph. Eur. monograph “Water for Injections” (04/2017:0169). Veyvondi 650 IU/vial (1300 
IU/vial) is reconstituted with 5 mL (10 mL) sWFI. Adequate information on the manufacturing process, 
container closure and stability has been provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 19/113 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Manufacturing process  
Sterilised WFI used for reconstitution is manufactured by a validated process. Adequate in-process controls 
have been established at the individual manufacturing steps to control the process. The manufacturing 
process is performed under GMP conditions. A valid certificate of GMP has been provided. Batch sizes for 
sWFI (5 and 10 mL fill size) have been indicated. 
Container closure systems  
The container closure systems of sWFI used for reconstitution of rVWF FP consist of glass vials of hydrolytic 
type I and rubber stoppers both complying with Ph. Eur. and USP. The 5 mL and the 10 mL solvent are 
supplied in a 6 mL and in a 10 mL vial respectively.  
Stability 
Shelf life claims for both sWFI fill sizes have been confirmed by real time/real temperature stability studies 
using adequate numbers of batches. Therefore the proposed shelf life for the sWFI 5 mL and 10 mL fill sizes 
at the recommended storage conditions is acceptable.  
Adventitious agents 
The active substance is produced from recombinant CHO cells using cell culture media without animal 
derived raw materials with a risk of virus or prion contamination. Cell cultures were adequately screened for 
potential viral contaminants according to Guideline ICH Q5A. Retrovirus-like particles (RVLPs) have been 
detected. However, this is acceptable and in line with ICH Q5A since the virus reduction capacity for this 
type of viral particle has been demonstrated to exceed the particle load in cell culture fluid which is required 
to produce a dose for treatment.  
No materials of animal origin are used in the manufacture of active substance, except for the WCB. 
Compendial materials are tested in accordance to the specified pharmacopeia monographs either by the 
supplier, by Baxalta, and/or by qualified external laboratories.  
Non-compendial materials and reagents (non-biologicals) are tested either by the supplier, by the applicant, 
or by external laboratories. Raw material specifications are presented in tabular overviews and indicate that 
these materials are qualified for their intended use. 
Due to the specific nature of the product, implementation of specific steps for non-enveloped virus reduction 
is difficult. This fact is scientifically proven by the full study package on feasibility studies for non-enveloped 
virus inactivation/removal that has been provided. The reduction capacity of the rhvWF purification process 
with respect to non-enveloped viruses is, however, compensated to an accepted extent by the tight control 
of the production process with respect to potential virus contamination including virus filtration of cell culture 
media.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Development, characterisation, manufacture and control of vonicog alfa active substance and finished 
product have been adequately and sufficiently described. 
The specifications established are appropriate and cover the relevant characteristics of the product. 
Acceptance limits have been well justified and mostly reflect manufacturing experience.  
Appropriate studies were conducted to further support the quantitative composition of the finished product 
and the selected finished product manufacturing process. The commercial manufacture of Veyvondi has been 
sufficiently described, controlled and verified to ensure consistent production of the finished product. 
Finished product stability studies were adequately performed and the results support the claimed shelf life 
for Veyvondi. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The applicant performed the following pharmacology studies:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 21/113 
  
  
 
 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacodynamics of rVWF was evaluated in vivo in different efficacy models using von 
Willebrand factor deficient (VWd) mice and VWd dogs. Additionally one in vitro study was performed 
investigating aspects of platelet aggregation. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
According to Guideline ICH S7A “Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals”, secondary 
pharmacodynamics studies are defined as “studies on the mode of action and/or effects of a substance not 
related to its desired therapeutic target”. Any secondary pharmacodynamic effects were assessed in safety 
pharmacology and toxicology studies, in which no effects other than those induced by the primary action of 
rVWF were observed. Therefore, no studies on secondary pharmacodynamics have been performed. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The anaphylactoid and thrombogenic potential of rVWF and its effects on blood pressure, cardiac and 
respiratory function and variables of coagulation activation were investigated in four in vivo studies in 
different animal models. 
Study PV 2040705 - Study of the anaphylactoid potential of rVWF: Blood pressure lowering activity in 
spontaneously hypertensive rats: Evaluation of preclinical lots alone and in combination with ADVATE. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 22/113 
  
  
 
The hypotensive anaphylactoid potential of two preclinical lots of rVWF was investigated after rapid infusion 
in anesthetised spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats under aggravated conditions (i.e. intra-arterial 
application). A positive reaction was defined as more than 30% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure 
lasting for longer than one minute within the first 10 min after treatment. Five groups of six male rats per 
group were used in the study. An intra-arterial actual dose of 240 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW with or without 185 IU 
rFVIII/kg BW was administered. 
Treatment with rVWF alone resulted in a positive reaction in one out of six animals for each lot of rVWF 
tested, which however was not statistically significant compared with the vehicle control group. No positive 
reactions were observed in animals treated with rVWF in combination with rFVIII or the vehicle control. A 
positive reaction in 1 out of 6 animals per test group is considered to be within the variability of the test 
system. Based on the results it is not expected that hypotensive reactions occur after treatment with rVWF 
alone or with Advate in clinical use. 
Study PV1900605 - Study on the anaphylactoid potential of recombinant human von Willebrand factor 
(rVWF) alone and in combination with recombinant human factor VIII (rFVIII) on bronchospastic activity in 
guinea pigs. 
The effects of rapid intra-arterial infusion of rVWF on pulmonary inflation pressure in guinea pigs as an 
indicator of bronchospastic anaphylactoid activity under aggravated conditions (i.e. intra-arterial application) 
was investigated in this study. A positive reaction was defined as an increase in pulmonary inflation pressure 
of ≥ 30% lasting for ≥ 1 min within the first 10 min after treatment. Six groups of eight male guinea pigs 
per group were used in the study. The actual intra-arterial dose administered in the study was 240 IU 
VWF:RCo/kg BW with or without 185 IU rFVIII/kg BW. 
There were no positive anaphylactoid reactions in animals treated with rVWF alone, rFVIII alone or 
formulation buffer. Two out of eight animals showed positive bronchospastic anaphylactoid reactions after 
treatment with one rVWF lot combined with Advate. No positive reactions were observed when this rVWF lot 
was evaluated alone. There were also no positive bronchospastic anaphylactoid reactions when a second lot 
of rVWF combined with Advate was evaluated. The results from the two evaluations were pooled and were 
not significantly different from the results of other items tested. 
Study PV2010701 - Investigation on potential thrombogenicity of recombinant human von Willebrand 
factor (rVWF) alone and in combination with recombinant human factor VIII (rFVIII) in a rabbit stasis model. 
The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential thrombogenicity of rVWF alone or co-administered with 
Advate (rFVIII) using a semi-quantitative method. This test is based on thrombus formation in a ligated vein 
segment after intravenous infusion of the test or reference items.  
One lot of rVWF, administered alone with Advate, was tested at the maximum feasible infusion volume of 10 
mL/kg, resulting in a dose of 1262 IU VWF:RCo/kg administered alone, or 812.5 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW 
administered with 623.7 IU rFVIII/kg BW (ratio = 1.3:1). As an active control, Haemate P was tested at the 
equivalent volume of 10 mL/kg, resulting in an actual dose of 782 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW and 650 IU FVIII/kg 
BW. As vehicle controls, corresponding buffer solutions were tested in a volume equivalent manner. Six 
animals (3 males and 3 females) were tested per group. 
The number and size of thrombi were evaluated using a score system (scale 0-4; 0= liquid blood without 
thrombi; 0.5-1= a few small thrombi; 2= several middle-sized thrombi or many small thrombi; 3= a greater 
number of middle-sized thrombi; 3.5= few larger thrombi; 4= large thrombus). Additionally, blood samples 
were drawn by cardiac puncture immediately after isolating the vein segment from the circulation to analyse

the actual plasma levels of VWF (VWF:Ag) and FVIII (FVIII activity) for calculating and comparing the in vivo 
recovery. 
No signs of thrombogenicity were detected at the tested dose levels for rVWF alone, rVWF administered with 
Advate, or the reference items (vehicle control or active control). All positive control animals showed a score 
of 4, verifying the test system (positive control: 20 U/kg FEIBA). 
In summary, administration of rVWF up to a dose of 1262 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW alone or with Advate up to a 
dose of 812.5 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW + 623.7 IU rFVIII/kg BW gave no indication of possible thrombogenicity in 
the rabbit stasis model. 
Study 34572 - Human recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF): Single-dose cardiovascular and 
respiratory safety pharmacology study in anesthetized dogs. 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential adverse effects of rVWF alone and in combination 
with Advate (rFVIII) on cardiovascular and respiratory function in anesthetised dogs following a single, 
intravenous exposure. 
Twenty dogs were randomly assigned to the following five treatment groups (2 males and 2 females per 
group): saline, Citrate Buffer + Advate Buffer, rVWF (240 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW), rVWF + rFVIII (240 IU 
VWF:RCo/kg BW + 185 IU rFVIII /kg BW, respectively), and Haemate P (240 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW and 200 IU 
FVIII/kg BW). A dose of 240 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW is approximately four-times higher than the anticipated 
clinical daily dose of 60 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW. A dose of 185 IU rFVIII/kg BW is based on a target ratio of 1.3 
± 0.2IU rVWF to 1 IIU rFVIII. A dose of 200 IU FVIII /kg BW is based on a fixed ratio of 1.2 IU VWF to 1 IU 
FVIII in Haemate P. 
The cardiovascular and respiratory effects of rVWF alone and in combination with Advate were transient and 
were similar to Citrate Buffer + Advate Buffer. One animal that received rVWF in combination with Advate, 
however, appeared to have reduced venous return. Whether this was due to individual animal variability, 
which is common for anaphylactoid reactions, or due to the concomitant administration of Advate could not 
be determined. These data suggest that the changes following rVWF alone and in combination with ADVATE 
were likely due to one or more of the excipients (e.g., polysorbate-80) common to both articles and not due 
to the active ingredient rVWF. The cardiovascular and respiratory changes following rVWF alone and in 
combination with Advate were mild in comparison to Haemate P. 
The hypersensitivity-like skin reactions following rVWF alone or in combination with Advate were similar in 
kind to reactions following Citrate Buffer + Advate Buffer. This reaction was not observed in the Haemate P-
treated animals and suggests that the reactions were due to one or more of the excipients common to all 
three test articles that are not present in Haemate P. 
The thrombocytopenia and concurrent decrease in platelet aggregation in response to the botrocetin agonist 
following rVWF alone or in combination with Advate were transient but were not observed following citrate 
buffer + Advate Buffer. These effects might be test item-related and may be a consequence of supernormal 
plasma concentrations of VWF in a normal, non-VWF deficient animal.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No dedicated pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed. rVWF does not undergo 
metabolism or transport as its clearance pathway; therefore, drug interactions are of limited concern. rVWF 
is a replacement protein for endogenous VWF, has a highly specific mode of action and its 
Assessment report

pharmacodynamics are well known from plasma-derived VWF products. Recombinant VWF is administered 
either alone or with a licensed rFVIII. The interaction between these two compounds has been assessed in 
the pharmacodynamics studies. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant performed the following pharmacokinetic studies: 
Single dose pharmacokinetic studies of recombinant von Willebrand factor (VWF) administered either alone 
or with a licensed recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) product, were performed in rats and Cynomolgus 
monkeys. In all nonclinical studies, the test items were provided as lyophilised powder, mixed after 
reconstitution at the ratio 1.3 (rVWF): 1 (rFVIII), and administered intravenously (i.v.).  
Von Willebrand factor deficient (VWd) mice and VWd dogs were used to evaluate PK properties of rVWF in 
animal models that reflect the condition in patients. The hypothesis for the studies was that the area under 
the curve (AUC) when rVWF is administered either alone or with Advate is non-inferior to the AUC with a 
pdFVIII. Von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) levels and FVIII levels were analysed separately. The main 
focus of the studies was the determination of VWF:Ag levels. Factor VIII levels were analysed using 
descriptive statistics. 
In vivo organ distribution of rVWF was studied in a VWd mouse model using positron emission tomography 
(PET). An ex vivo human placental transfer study was performed to assess whether rVWF passes the 
placenta.

Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity of rVWF with or without rFVIII was assessed in three different murine strains 
(ADAMTS13 knock out (ko) mice, C57BL/6J mice, and VWF deficient mice), rats, rabbits, and Cynomolgus 
monkeys:  
•  Study PV1940601 - Acute toxicity of human recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) alone or in 
combination with human recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) after intravenous application in ADAMTS13-
deficient mice after a single intravenous injection in ADAMTS13 -deficient mice (ADAMTS13 knockout 
mice) at dosing levels 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 IU/kg BW. 
•  Study PV1990701 - Acute toxicity of human recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) alone or in 
combination with human recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) after intravenous application in C57BL/6J 
mice at dosing levels 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 IU/kg BW. 
•  Study PV1930601 - Acute toxicity of human recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) alone or in 
combination with human recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) after intravenous application in VWF-
deficient mice at dosing levels 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 IU/kg BW. 
•  Study AU0507W01 - Acute toxicity of human recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) combined 
with human recombinant ADAMTS-13 (rADAMTS-13) after intravenous application in ADAMTS-13-
deficient mice. Recombinant VWF at a concentration of 2000 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW was co-infused with 
rADAMTS13 at 19.4μg/kg (according to a ratio analysed in a human plasma derived preparation, 
Haemate P).  
•  Study PV1950601 - Acute toxicity of human recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) alone or in 
combination with human recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) after intravenous application in rats. 
•  Study BAX0009 - Human recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF), single dose toxicity study by 
intravenous administration to rabbits. 
•  Study BAX0011 - Human recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) single dose toxicity study by 
intravenous (bolus) administration to Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Plasma samples for toxicokinetic (TK) evaluation after a single dose were analysed for rabbits and 
Cynomolgus monkeys. Single-dose toxicity of rVWF co-infused with recombinant ADAMTS13 was 
investigated in ADAMTS13-deficient mice. In rats, rabbits, and Cynomolgus monkeys, the possible 
occurrence of signs of toxicity or thrombogenicity was investigated after single dosing.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Toxicity after repeated administration was investigated in rats, in one VWd pig, and in Cynomolgus 
monkeys: 
•  Study 33981 - Human recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF): 14-day intravenous toxicity 
study in rats. 
•  Study RD_VB_110704 – Study to investigate human recombinant von Willebrand factor in von 
Willebrand factor deficient pigs. 
•  Study EWA0015 – Recombinant human von Willebrand factor (rVWF) toxicity study by intravenous 
(bolus) administration to cynomolgus monkeys for 14 days followed by 18 day recovery period.

Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies are normally not applicable to the assessment of safety of biotechnology-derived 
pharmaceuticals such as rVWF. Genotoxicity of rVWF was investigated in the following studies: 
•  Study BAX22 - Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation test (Ames Test) with and without 
metabolic activation and chromosome aberration test 
•  Study BAX0013 - In vitro mammalian chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes. 
•  Study BAX24 - Micronucleus test with mice. 
Carcinogenicity 
As stated in the current regulatory guidance ICH S6(R1)-Guidance for Industry, Preclinical Safety Evaluation 
of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals, carcinogenicity testing of biological products is not required 
unless there is cause for concern. Therefore, since there is no lack of concern for the carcinogenic potential 
of rVWF, no carcinogenicity studies have been performed. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The applicant did not perform any reproduction toxicity studies. 
Local Tolerance  
Results of a local tolerance study (Study PV2000701 - Investigation of local tolerance of recombinant human 
von Willebrand factor (rVWF) alone and in combination with recombinant human factor VIII (rFVIII) in 
rabbits) conducted in rabbits after i.v., intra-arterial, or paravenous administration indicated that rVWF 
administered alone or with rFVIII was well tolerated. 
Other toxicity studies 
An immunogenicity study (Study FS-IM00907) was performed to compare recombinant and plasma-derived 
human VWF (pdVWF) in Balb/c mice. 
A study (Study IMM_R&D_017_11) on the influence of administration of VWF and rFVIII on the 
immunogenicity of rFVIII in three different haemophilic mouse models (E17 hemophilic Balb/c mice, E17 
haemophilic C57BL/6J mice and E17 haemophilic human F8 transgenic mice) was also performed. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Veyvondi contains a protein as active pharmaceutical ingredient, which due to its nature is unlikely to result 
in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, Veyvondi is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment and the absence of need of ERA studies is considered justified.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics of rVWF was evaluated in two different efficacy models using von-Willebrand-
Factor deficient (VWD) mice and dogs. In the arterial thrombosis model in mice, efficacy of rVWF co-injected 
with rFVIII could be demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner. Further investigations clarified that human 
recombinant ADAMTS13 cleaves rVWF in vivo, resulting in a rVWF potency in the mice similar to that of 
pdVWF. In the tail tip bleeding model a reduction of blood loss, in a linear dose-dependent manner, of rVWF 
co-injected with rFVIII could be demonstrated.  
In a study to compare human recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) with plasma-derived von Willebrand 
factor (pdVWF) in von Willebrand-factor-deficient dogs recombinant VWF stabilised canine FVIII in the 
circulation and significantly reduced the saline bleeding time whereas pdVWF did not exert a similar efficacy. 
As only two animals have been used (one for rVWF and one for pdVWF), the significance of this model is 
considered questionable as it did not provide meaningful information. Nevertheless, the data from the other 
pharmacodynamic studies are considered sufficient to support the assumption of rVWF’ efficacy.  
Concerning safety pharmacology, four studies have been performed: two studies investigating the 
anaphylactic potential (i.e. blood pressure lowering and bronchospastic activity), one study upon 
thrombogenicity (i.e. Wessler test) and one cardiovascular and respiratory safety pharmacology study in 
anesthetised dogs. The results do not raise any safety concerns. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of human rVWF has been studied in four different species: VWD mice, normal rats, von 
Willebrand-Factor-deficient dogs and monkeys.  
It could be statistically confirmed that the AUC with rVWF alone or rVWF+rFVIII is non-inferior but superior 
to the AUC with pdVWF in mice. In rats, the AUC for rVWF alone or in combination with rFVIII is non-inferior 
to the AUC with pdVWF.  
The rVWF half-life was longer than the half-life for pdVWF in VWD dogs (13.0 h vs. 8.7 h).  
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of VWF:Ag of rVWF as observed in Cynomolgus monkeys were not 
affected by co-administration of rFVIII. Measurable VWF levels were detected up to 12 hours after single 
administration of rVWF at a dose of 100 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW.  
An in vivo distribution study revealed an increased radioactivity in the spleen, possibly related to immune 
reactions to human rVWF (e.g. phagocytosis). No obvious uptake was seen in any of the other organs. 
In an ex vivo human placental transfer study it could be demonstrated that the recombinant VWF does not 
pass the human placenta. 
As the metabolic pathways are generally understood studies on metabolism and excretion are not needed. 
No dedicated pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been performed. 
Toxicology 
Concerning toxicology seven single dose toxicity studies in four different species (3 different murine strains: 
ADAMTS knock-out mice, C57BL/6J mice and VWD-mice; in rats; rabbits and monkeys) have been 
performed. Repeat dose toxicity has been tested in rats and monkeys. In these studies the following NOAELs 
were determined: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 30/113 
  
  
• 
• 
Rats: 1400 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW alone or co-administered with 1077 IU/kg rFVIII, 
Rabbits: 1200 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW for rVWF administered alone or 600 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW + 462 IU 
rFVIII/kg for rVWF in combination with rFVIII, 
• 
Cynomolgus monkeys: 1200 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW for rVWF administered alone or 600 IU VWF:RCo/kg 
BW + 462 IU rFVIII/kg for rVWF in combination with rFVIII, 
•  Mice: 250 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW in the ADAMTS13 knockout mouse and C57BL/6J mouse and 500 IU 
VWF:RCo/kg BW in the VWD mouse. 
Based on the high no observed adverse effect levels in rabbits and monkeys after intravenous application, 
whose endogenous ADAMTS13 were demonstrated to cleave rVWF, as well as the demonstrated 
susceptibility of rVWF to human ADAMTS13 in vitro, a sufficient safety margin between the maximum human 
dose expected to be applied in clinical studies (80 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW) and the experimental dose used in 
the non-clinical studies was demonstrated. 
Further studies on toxicology include local tolerance testing, three studies on genotoxicity (AMES, 
chromosome aberration, micronucleus) and studies on immunogenicity. The results of these studies do not 
reveal safety concerns. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the type and amount of non-clinical studies investigating pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology of rVWF in different species and several models are considered sufficient and appropriate to 
support the marketing authorisation.

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of Veyvondi were determined in three clinical studies by assessing the plasma 
levels of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand Factor Antigen (VWF:Ag), and von Willebrand Collagen Binding Activity 
(VWF:CB). In all three studies, subjects were evaluated in the non-bleeding state. Sustained increase of 
FVIII:C was observed by six hours after a single infusion of Veyvondi.  
In the Phase 1 study (070701), there were 31 subjects treated with Veyvondi. 5 and 4 subjects with Type 3 
VWD of dose Cohort 2 (7.5 IU/kg) and Cohort 3 (20 IU/kg) were included in the full PK analysis set. Dose 
Cohort 1 (N=3 subjects, dose 2.5 IU/kg) was excluded due to major protocol deviations. 19 subjects with 
Type 3 VWD and 3 subjects with severe Type 1 VWD were included in the crossover Cohort 4. PK was further 
evaluated in Arm 1 and 2 (PK50: randomised crossover of rVWF:rFVIII vs. pdVWF:pdFVIII, dose level 50 
IU/kg of VWF:RCo, N=16) of the Phase 3 study 071001. Repeated PK of 80 IU/kg VEYVONDI (PK80) was 
analysed in 15 subjects of Arm 3 of study 071001. In the Phase 3 surgery study (071101), PK of 50 IU/kg 
Veyvondi was evaluated in 11 out of 15 subjects with severe VWD undergoing major or minor elective 
surgical procedures.  
Table 2 summarizes the PK of VEYVONDI after 50 IU/kg VWR:RCo (PK50) or 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo (PK80) 
infusions . The mean duration of infusion was 16.5 minutes (SD ± 3.51 minutes) for 50 IU/kg (PK 50) and 
11.8 minutes (± 2.86 minutes) for 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo (PK80).

Table 3: Overview of PK evaluations in clinical studies of VEYVONDI 
The PK profile in VWD (and haemophilia A) patients was evaluated for VWF:RCo (a surrogate for the platelet 
dependent function of rVWF), VWF:Ag, VWF:CB (a surrogate for adhesion of rVWF to subendothelial 
collagen), and FVIII:C using non-compartmental analysis. Parameters assessed were as follows: Area under 
the plasma concentration/time curve (AUC0-∞, AUC0-t), area under the first moment curve (AUMC), mean 
residence time (MRT), clearance (CL), terminal half-life (T1/2), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), 
and incremental recovery (IR). PK analyses used the actual sampling times as specified in the protocol and 
concentration data were corrected for baseline by subtraction of the pre-infusion value. PK sampling time 
points were largely consistent with the recommendations made in the current EMA guideline for pdVWF 
products. Wash-out period corresponded to at least five half-lives for VWF and/or FVIII in study 070701. A 
minimum of 8 and 5 days wash-out was required before PK assessment in studies 071001 and 071101. 
Study 071104 had a wash-out period of at least 5 days for FVIII and 8 days for VEYVONDI. 
Absorption  
Veyvondi is administered intravenously, thus no specific data on absorption are provided. Median IR for 
VWF:RCo as determined in Phase 1 study 070701 was 1.45 (U/dL)/(U VWF:RCo/kg) infused at the 50 IU 
dose level and similar to IR of a licensed pdVWF/pdFVIII concentrate, which was 1.52 (U/dL)/(U 
VWF:RCo/kg) as tested in the crossover Cohort 4. IR as determined by VWF:Ag appeared to be higher with 
pdVWF which was argued to originate from different initial specific activities of rVWF and pdVWF, however, 
IR determined by VWF:CB paralleled VWF:RCo activity. Results from the Phase 3 studies (071001 and 
071101) where comparable to the Phase 1 study with a median recovery of 1.8 and 2.0 U/dL per IU/kg for 
VWF:RCo.

Equivalence of the PK profiles (AUC0-inf) of rVWF:rFVIII and a licensed pdVWF:pdFVIII product was specified 
as objective in study 070701 and tested in the crossover Cohort 4. The ratio of AUC0-inf  geometric means of 
rVWF:rFVIII and pdVWF:pdFVIII was slightly larger for VWF:RCo (1.26, 90% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.02; 
1.56), VWF:CB (1.18, 90% CI 0.87; 1.59), and FVIII:C activity (1.36, 90% CI: 0.93; 1.99) whereas the 
AUC0-inf  geometric mean ratio was similar for VWF:Ag (0.93, 90% CI: 0.69; 1.26). Median T1/2 appeared to 
be extended for VEYVONDI when compared with pdVWF (i.e. 16.0 and 12.58 hours, respectively). In further 
comparison of the recombinant and plasma-derived VWF products (study 070701), Cmax was 66 and 79.5 
U/dl, Tmax was 0.7 and 0.58 hours, and Vss 0.84 dL/kg and 0.91 dL/kg, respectively. With regard to 
VEYVONDI distribution, assessment of Vss (VWF:RCo) in studies 071001 and 071101 showed comparable 
results (0.7 dL/kg) to study 070701 (0.8 dL/kg) and the apparent Vss of VEYVONDI matches that of pdVWF 
and blood volume of adults. 
Elimination 
Veyvondi as a recombinant analogue of endogenous VWF undergoes the same catabolic pathways. Thus, no 
specific studies regarding excretion, metabolism or inter-conversion are presented. As assessed in study 
070701 using VWF:RCo, median CL of Veyvondi was slower than with pdVWF at 50 IU/kg dose level (0.034 
and 0.047 dL/kg/ hours, respectively) without relevant dose dependency. In PK50 assessment of Phase 3 
study 071001, CL was 0.024 dL/kg/ hours and similar for rVWF:rFVIII compared to rVWF alone. Similar 
results for CL were obtained in the PK80 assessment of study 071001 and in PK assessment in study 
071101. Median T1/2 of Veyvondi for VFW:RCo at 50 IU/kg dose level in Phase 1 study (070701) was 16 
hours and 12.58 hours for pdVWF:FVIII with similar limits of the 90% CI. It was further referenced that T1/2 
of different pdVWF products are in the range of 12 -15 hours. As shown in the side by side comparison of PK

results, median T1/2 of VEYVONDI administration without rFVIII and assessed by VWF:RCo was in the same 
range or even higher in study 071001, i.e. 21.4 hours in the PK50 and 18.6/19.4 hours in the repeated PK80 
assessments, respectively. In the surgery study (071101) median T1/2 was 14.6 hours. 
Additionally, a PK comparison for rVWF:rFVIII and pdVWF:pdFVIII including data of study 070701 and Phase 
3 study 071001 was re-performed. Results indicate an 1.4661 times larger AUC0-∞ with rVWF:rFVIII than 
with pdVWF:pdFVIII in-line with the results of the phase I study indicating an 1.49 times larger AUC0-∞ with 
rVWF:rFVIII than with pdVWF:pdFVIII with the per-protocol data set. These results do not support 
equivalence in AUC0-∞ between rVWF:rFVIII and pdVWF:pdFVIII as well as between rVWF with 
pdVWF:pdFVIII as the corresponding two-sided 90% CIs did not fall completely within the conventional 
margins of bioequivalence ranging from 0.80 to 1.25. Results for mean residence time (MRT) indicate a 
1.9645 and a 1.7943 times longer persistence of VWF:RCo activity in the body with rVWF and rVWF:rFVIII 
than with pdVWF:FVIII, respectively. Results for t 1/2 indicate a 1.8776 and 1.7073 times longer terminal 
half-life with rVWF and rVWF:rFVIII than with pdVWF:FVIII, respectively. Differences for AUC0-∞, MRT and 
t 1/2 were statistically significant at the 5% level. Results for the subset of hereditary type III subjects 
support the results obtained from the combined analysis of type I and type III subjects 
An exploratory analysis of combined data from studies 070701 and 071001 indicated a statistically 
significantly (at the 5% level) longer mean residence time, a statistically significantly (at the 5% level) 
longer terminal half-life and statistically significantly (at the 5% level) larger AUC0-∞ regarding VWF:RCo 
following administration with VEYVONDI (50 IU/kg VWF:RCo) and combined administration of VEYVONDI and 
octocog alfa (50 IU/kg VWF:RCo and 38.5 IU/kg rFVIII) than after administration of pdVWF and pdFVIII (50 
IU/kg pdVWF:RCo and 38.5 IU/kg pdFVIII). 
A comparison of VWF PK parameters as assessed by VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:Ag in the PK50 and PK80 
Arms of study 071001 has been provided showing that in general, VWF:CB and VWF:Ag paralleled the 
VWF:RCo measurements. The impact of FVIII on the PK profile of Veyvondi was addressed in study 071001 
in the PK50 crossover treatments of Arm 1 and 2 (rVWF:rFVIII vs. rVWF:Placebo). Results show, that FVIII 
had no substantial effect on VWF levels when assessed by VWF:RCo, VWF:CB or VWF:Ag.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality of Veyvondi co-infused with rFVIII (ratio 1.3:1) was assessed in the Phase 1 study 
(070701). Three doses of Veyvondi (7.5, 20 and 50 IU/kg, the 2 IU/kg dose Cohort 1 was excluded from full 
PK analysis set) were analysed and using VWF:RCo, a monotonic dose dependency was found for AUC, 
AUMC and Cmax although statistical significant dose linearity could not be demonstrated using regression

analysis of AUC and IR. It was argued, that this is likely due to the small study population and high 
variability between cohort sizes (N=5-22). Median (90% CI) AUC0-inf (h*U/dL) for Cohort 2, 3 and 4 were 
233.51 (151.69; 368.03), 620.82 (356.49; 765.13) and 1373.83 (1255.29; 1858.23), respectively. Median 
Cmax values (90% CI) in Cohorts 2, 3 and 4 were 18 (14;18), 30.5 (25; 37) and 66 (62; 92) U/dL. 
In terms of inter-individual variability, single PK profiles for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, VWV:CB and FVIII:C have 
been shown for Phase 3 study 071001 in the PK50 Cohorts comparing rVWF and rVWF:rFVIII treatments 
without revealing substantial differences. As recommended by the current EMA guideline for pdVWF 
products, VWD patients should also be re-tested for the same pharmacokinetic parameters after at least 6 
months which has been done in the PK80 Cohort of study 071001.

As of particular importance in the target population, Veyvondi is expected to stabilise FVIII and an increase 
of FVIII activity was observed after each single PK infusion of Veyvondi in study 071001. After infusion of 50 
IU/kg Veyvondi without rFVIII, the median FVIII:C concentration steadily increased from 8.0 U/dL at 15 
minutes post-infusion to a peak of 86.0 U/dL at 24 hours post-infusion. For rVWF:rFVIII treated subjects, 
the median concentration of FVIII:C increased from 95.5 U/dL at 15 minutes post-infusion to a peak of 110-
111 U/dL at 12-24 hours post-infusion. The median FVIII:C AUC0-∞/dose was higher with rVWF:rFVIII 
compared with rVWF alone (145.4 and 113.0 h*U/dL, respectively). Subjects in the PK80 Arm of study 
071001 showed similar median FVIII:C activities at PK1 and PK2 after infusion of Veyvondi alone, i.e. 
median AUC0-∞/dose were 96.8 and 94.8 h*U/dL, respectively. These results were also paralleled by a 
repeated PK80 subanalysis including Type 3 VWD subjects only. Apparent intra-individual variability between 
PK1 and PK2 assessments is discussed below. With reference to FVIII:C activity, results from the phase 3 
surgery study (071101) were largely comparable to previous PK evaluations. 
Multimeric distribution of VWF was measured in studies 070701 and 071001. In study 070701, the 
multimeric pattern of rVWF over several hours following infusion and the loss of the ultra-large multimers 
(ULM) were analysed. Occurrence of larger multimers was initially more pronounced for patients treated with 
Veyvondi when compared to pdVWF treated patients. However, the high-molecular weight multimers 
gradually disappeared in a comparable manner. In the PK50 Arm of Phase 3 study 071001, the median 
percentage of ULMs increased from 0% pre-infusion to 30% at 15 min post-infusion of rVWF:rFVIII or rVWF 
followed by a steadily decline to 2% within 96 hours post-infusion in the rVWF:rFVIII treated subjects (Table 
5). Accordingly, medium sized VWF multimers showed a lagged increase up to 39.5% at 6 hours post-
infusion and were reduced down to 19.5% at 96 hours post-infusion. Small sized multimers continuously 
increased to 78.5% at the latest time point. Treatment with Veyvondi without rFVIII showed comparable 
results in the crossover group. Multimer analyses in the PK80 arm were similar to the results observed in the 
PK50 Arm.

Supportive PK studies: 
Supportive PK data were derived from 3 PK assessments of FVIII:C during a Phase 1 study conducted in 
patients with haemophilia A (071104), i.e. after single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIII (Adavte) alone (first PK 
infusion) and in combination with Veyvondi at 10 and 50 IU/kg (VWF:RCo) (second and third PK infusions). 
As assessed for the primary outcome, a slight increase in the geometric means of AUC, MRT and T1/2 of 
rFVIII with the addition of rVWF was observed, in particular for the 50 IU/kg dose of rVWF (e.g. T1/2 was 
12.05 h for rFVIII alone and 13.74 h in combination with 50 IU/kg rVWF, respectively). However, this 
elevation was statistically not significant when compared to rFVIII alone. Results for the secondary outcome 
measures (distributional half-life, Cmax, Tmax, IR and IVR) showed no relevant differences. The observed mild 
extension of half-life is considered insufficient to change infusion frequency of FVIII in haemophilia A 
patients. 
In addition to PK assessments from the clinical trials, results of in vitro studies were provided using human 
biomaterials to investigate the primary haemostatic activity of ULMs in human VWF deficient patient blood 
(N=8). Examination of VWF mediated platelet adhesion and aggregation under blood-like flow conditions 
with different VWF products showed that the aggregate covered surface was statistically significantly higher 
with rVWF drug candidate Veyvondi when compared to rVWF lacking the ULMs or with pdVWF pointing to a 
higher efficacy of the ULMs in supporting platelet adhesion and aggregation. Additionally, whole blood 
aperture closure times were determined to specifically assess the effect of ULMs when added to whole blood 
of VWD patients at equal protein mass. Closure time was shortest for Veyvondi containing patient blood 
when compared to rVWF lacking ULMs and pdVWF but similar to blood from healthy donors. Of the various 
VWF products, multimer analyses were performed to compare distribution. As assessed by low- and high 
resolution gel-electrophoresis, nineteen multimers were clearly separated and counted for Veyvondi, 16 
multimers for rVWF without ULMs, 13 multimers for pdVWF and 21 multimers for normal human plasma. 
VWF triplet pattern with a slow and fast migrating band vicinal to a central dominant band were observed for 
human normal plasma. While the fast migrating bands were still observable for the pdVWF on the high-
resolution gel, satellite bands were missing for Veyvondi which was expected because Veyvondi had no 
previous exposure to the Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 during the manufacturing process.

Special populations 
Eldery subjects of 65 years of age and older were not eligible in studies 070701, 071001 and 071104. In the 
Phase 3 surgery study (071101) the median age of the 15 treated subjects at screening was 40.0 years 
(range 20.0 to 70.0 years). No specific analysis regarding elderly patients was conducted. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
• 
In vitro 
An in-vitro study using human biomaterials has been conducted to investigate the primary haemostatic 
activity of ULM in rVWF drug candidate (namely Veyvondi) in human VWF deficient patient blood. In this 
study, 8 VWD patients with low residual activity voluntarily donated blood. 5/8 subjects had <10% VFW 
protein concentration and or function, 3/8 subjects had VWF protein concentration 10-40% of normal). Blood 
from 3 healthy donors served as control. To examine VWF mediated platelet adhesion and aggregation under 
high shear flow conditions simulating blood flow like conditions, collagen surfaces were perfused with VWD 
deficient blood spiked with various VWF products (Veyvondi, rVWF fraction lacking ULM, and a pdVWF/FVIII 
concentrate [Humate-P]). A shear rate of 30,000s-1 was selected because of particular impact of the VWF-
ULMs on the assay. As observed using a rectangular parallel plate flow chamber, the aggregate covered 
surface was statistically significant higher with the Veyvondi when compared to rVWF lacking the ULMs or 
with pdVWF pointing to a higher efficacy of the ULMs in supporting platelet adhesion and aggregation. 
However, blood control showed the largest aggregate surface coverage which was attributed to the 
experimental setup. If whole blood control undergoes the same preparation steps as washed blood cell 
solutions containing rVWF ± ULM, less aggregate surface coverage was found for the control. Additionally, 
whole blood aperture closure time was determined to specifically assess the effect of ULMs when added to 
whole blood of VWD patients at equal protein mass. In this experimental setting, the process of wound 
closure under elevated shear flow conditions is simulated thus investigating platelet- and VWF-related 
primary haemostasis. Closure time was shortest for Veyvondi containing patient blood when compared to 
rVWF lacking ULMs and pdVWF but similar to blood from healthy donors. Similar results were obtained using 
PFA-200 test cartridges if coated with collagen/epinephrine and collage/ADP. Additionally, VWF multimer 
analyses were performed to compare distribution between the different products used in the study. As 
assessed by low- and high resolution gel-electrophoresis (1% or 2% agarose), nineteen multimers were 
clearly separated and counted for Veyvondi, 16 multimers for rVWF without ULMs, 13 multimers for pdVWF 
and 21 multimers for normal human plasma . As expected and demonstrated with the higher agarose 
concentration, VWF triplet pattern with a slow and fast migrating band vicinal to a central dominant band 
were observed for human normal plasma. While the fast migrating bands were still observable for the pdVWF 
on the high-resolution gel, satellite bands were missing for Veyvondi. This was expected as Veyvondi had no 
exposure to the Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 during the manufacturing process. 
Supportive data have been provided by another collaborative in vitro study evaluating VWF aggregate 
formation in dependence on VWF-ULM and on rVWF-coated surfaces at shear rates of 20,000 s-1 and higher. 
In result, rVWF showed enhanced formation of aggregates if preparations contained ULMs. Addition of 
recombinant ADAMTS13 in the beginning of the experiment limited rolling aggregate and platelet-VWF-
conglomerate formation within a time window of 8 minutes demonstrating efficacy of ADAMTS13 protease in 
regulation of VFW multimeric distribution.

In vivo 
Veyvondi is known to interact with FVIII and both, rFVIII and pdFVIII were applied in the clinical studies. 
The effect of Veyvondi on endogenous FVIII levels was evaluated in Phase 3 study (071001) showing that 
application of Veyvondi leads to a substantial rise of FVIII:C activity. The effect of Veyvondi on PK profile of 
FVIII has also been evaluated in subjects with haemophilia A without showing major differences if Veyvondi 
was added to FVIII treatment. No analyses of the effects of extrinsic factors on PK of Veyvondi were 
performed and no potential effects of other concomitant medications or other drug interactions have been 
analysed. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Veyvondi is a recombinant human von Willebrand factor (rVWF). Veyvondi behaves in the same way as 
endogenous von Willebrand factor. 
Administration of Veyvondi allows correction of the haemostatic abnormalities exhibited by patients who 
suffer from von Willebrand factor deficiency (von Willebrand's disease) at two levels: 
-Veyvondi re-establishes platelet adhesion to the vascular sub-endothelium at the site of vascular damage 
(as it binds both to the vascular sub-endothelium matrix (e.g. collagen) and to the platelet membrane), 
providing primary haemostasis as shown by the shortening of the bleeding time.. This effect occurs 
immediately and is known to depend to a large extent on the level of polymerisation of the protein. 
-Veyvondi produces delayed correction of the associated factor VIII deficiency. Administered intravenously, 
Veyvondi binds to endogenous factor VIII (which is produced normally by the patient), and by stabilising this 
factor, avoids its rapid degradation. Because of this, administration of Veyvondi restores the FVIII:C level to 
normal as a secondary effect. After the first infusion, the FVIII:C rises above 40% within 6 hours and peaks 
within 24 hours in a majority of patients, depending on the baseline FVIII:C level. 
VEYVONDI is a rVWF that contains ultra-large multimers in addition to all of the multimers found in plasma 
as it is not exposed to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 during the manufacturing process. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No specific studies on pharmacodynamics have been performed as PK assessment of VWF, i.e. VWF:RCo, 
VWF:CB, and VWF:Ag, reflects its pharmacological activity. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK profile of Veyvondi was evaluated throughout four clinical trials in accordance with the current EMA 
guideline for pdVWF products (CPMP/BPWG/220/02). In the initial Phase 1 study (070701), the PK profile of 
single doses of Veyvondi, i.e. 2, 7.5, 20 and 50 IU/kg, co-administered with rFVIII was evaluated and 
compared with a combination of pdVWF and pdFVIII at the 50 IU/kg dose level for VWF. In the Phase 3 
study 071001, PK was assessed for Veyvondi alone at 50 IU/kg and 80 IU/kg dose levels and in crossover 
with co-administration of rFVIII at the 50 IU/kg dose level and a repeated PK analysis was performed at the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 41/113 
  
  
 
80 IU/kg dose level. In the Phase 3 surgery study (071101), PK assessment was performed once before 
surgery using single doses of 50 IU/kg of Veyvondi. 
In general, PK parameters were consistent throughout the different trials and measures of VWF:CB and 
VWF:Ag were largely comparable to VWF:RCo. Median T1/2 of Veyvondi co-administered with rFVIII and as 
determined using VFW:RCo at 50 IU/kg dose level was 16 hours whereas T1/2  of pdVWF:pdFVIII was 12.58 
hours (Phase 1 study 070701). Half-lifes of VEYVONDI were higher in the non-surgery Phase 3 study 
compared to the Phase 1 study (i.e. T1/2 was 21.4, 19.8, 18.6 and 19.4 hours for 50 IU/kg rVWF alone, co-
administered  with rFVIII, and for PK1 and PK2 assessment of 80 IU/kg rVWF). In the surgery study T1/2 was 
14.6 hours. Regarding other PK parameters including Tmax, Cmax, Vss and IR were largely similar for Veyvondi 
and pdVWF suggesting comparable specific activities for Veyvondi and pdVWF. 
Evaluation of bioequivalence by the comparison of AUC for rVWF:rFVIII and pdVWF:pdFVIII following single 
infusions of each product and assessed by VWF:RCo was defined as an objective of study 070701. According 
to the study protocol (Study 070701 - Protocol Amend 6-2009 Oct06, Section 5.3.3.2) the The calculated 
two-sided 90% CI had to be contained completely in the margins of equivalence defined as 80% to 125% to 
establish PK equivalence in AUC0-inf  with a type I error of 5%. Apparently, this This criterion was not met for 
VWF:RCo as the ratio of AUC0-inf  geometric means of rVWF:rFVIII and pdVWF:pdFVIII was 1.26 (90% CI: 
1.02; 1.56). A A subsequent combined PK analysis was provided integrating data from Phase 1 study 
070701 and Phase 3 study 071001 demonstrating demonstrated statistical significant increases of in AUC0-∞, 
MRT and t 1/2 for rVWF administered alone or in combination with rFVIII when compared with a plasma-
derived VWF:FVIII product.  
An exploratory analysis of combined data from studies 070701 and 071001 indicated a statistically 
significantly (at the 5% level) longer mean residence time, a statistically significantly (at the 5% level) 
longer terminal half-life and statistically significantly (at the 5% level) larger AUC0-∞ regarding VWF:RCo 
following administration with VEYVONDI (50 IU/kg VWF:RCo) and combined administration of VEYVONDI and 
octocog alfa (50 IU/kg VWF:RCo and 38.5 IU/kg rFVIII) than after administration of pdVWF and pdFVIII (50 
IU/kg pdVWF:RCo and 38.5 IU/kg pdFVIII). 
However, considering that Veyvondi is not indicated for regular prophylactic use, this issue does not impact 
on the posology, including lowering of the dose and/or reduction of infusion number for bleeding treatment. 
With regards to episodic treatment of bleeding events and perioperative use, the posology as outlined in the 
SmPC is based on study results and considered adequate. In addition, it has been outlined in the SmPC that 
rVWF inherently has a PK profile different to pdVWF. 
A significant linear dose response could not be demonstrated in the Phase 1 PK study and it is acknowledged 
that small and heterogeneous cohort sizes hamper statistical proof of dose response linearity. However, a 
graphical presentation has been provided suggesting a linear dose-response relationship for Veyvondi as 
determined by AUC0-∞ after single dose of 7.5, 20 and 50 IU/kg. Furthermore regarding dose-response 
relationship, IR appears to be independent from dose/kg taken methodical drawbacks into account. 
Considering the overall low number of analysed subjects and variability in cohort size and with regards to 
dose-response relationship, provided PK data are acceptable. 
With regard to FVIII:C activity, administration of Veyvondi in the Phase 3 studies 071001 and 071101 
substantially increased endogenous FVIII levels demonstrating its efficacy in FVIII stabilisation. 
Methods to measure VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:Ag were validated as well as FVIII:C activity when 
assessed by the one-stage clotting assay. For determination of FVIII activity using the clotting assay a 
validation report and corresponding SOP have been provided which is not the case for the chromogenic

assay. As the use of the chromogenic and/or the clotting assay for determination of FVIII activity has not 
been outlined consistently in the clinical study reports, the Applicant responded that for analysis of FVIII 
activity in patient plasma the majority of clinical laboratories use the one-stage clotting assay and in 
accordance, the one-stage clotting assay was preferentially used for FVIII activity measurements throughout 
the clinical studies. Reference showing that the one-stage clotting assay is used more frequently by 
laboratory scientists has been provided. In conclusion, it is considered acceptable that preferentially the one-
stage clotting assay was applied, although there is evidence supporting the use of the chromogenic assay for 
FVIII activity measurement in patients (Barrowcliffe, T. W. "Factor VIII and factor IX Sub-Committee). 
Recommendations for the assay of high-purity factor VIII concentrates." Thrombosis and haemostasis 70.5 
(1993): 876-877.), there are no substantial concerns with the application of the clotting-assay. The clotting-
assay was used for measurements of Advate. Advate is a recombinant full-length molecule similar to the 
naturally occurring factor VIII and no relevant discrepancy between the two assays has been described for 
this product (with further reference to: Peetz, D. "Factor VIII methods: Which assay principle for which 
indication?." 36 th Hemophilia Symposium Hamburg 2005. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2007). 
An additional concern was raised with reference to FVIII:C activity and the repeated PK assessments in the 
PK80 Arm of study 071001. Profiles of 5 out of 13 subjects showed substantial intra-individual variability for 
FVIII:C in the second PK assessment with a less pronounced or lagged increase of total FVIII:C activity. This 
was not properly reflected by the applicant, in particular because comparison of PK1 and PK2 was based on 
solely on AUC 0-96h/Dose and AUC0-inf/Dose and because second PK80 data were not available for 2 subjects 
who were included in the first PK80 analysis. The Applicant agreed that intra-individual differences in the 
repeated PK assessments in arm 3 of study 071001 occurred and data have been provided showing that 
there were no substantial differences between the two PK assessments. In order to achieve haemostatic 
plasma level of FVIII activity and as outlined in the SmPC, Veyvondi should be administered with 
recombinant factor VIII if the FVIII:C levels are <40%, or are unknown. Thus, it can be agreed, that 
therapeutic relevance of the observed intra-individual differences in the rise of total FVIII activity following 
an injection of rVWF alone is low. 
Regarding multimeric distribution, it has been demonstrated that Veyvondi contains a substantial amount of 
ULMs showing high efficacy in platelet mediated adhesion and aggregation as demonstrated by supportive in 
vitro studies. It was further demonstrated that multimeric distribution is sufficiently regulated by the plasma 
protease ADAMTS13. 
Throughout the clinical development program of Veyvondi, a sufficient number of patients with severe VWD 
has been treated for PK assessment, i.e. 31 subjects from study 070701 (including 28 Type 3 VWD patients 
from Cohorts 2, 3 and 4A), 31 from study 071001 (16 subjects in the crossover PK full analysis set of study 
Arm 1 and 2, and 15 subjects in the repeated PK full analysis set, all together with approximately 78% type 
3 VWD patients), and 11 subjects from study 071101 (8 subjects with Type 3 VWD) were included in the 
respective full analysis sets. A separate analysis of Type 3 VWD patients has been conducted for the PK80 
Arm of study 071001 without showing relevant differences compared to all subjects in this group. Supportive 
PK assessment has been performed in additional 12 patients with haemophilia A (study 071104). In all 
studies assessing PK of Veyvondi or its effect on FVIII activity, sufficient washout periods had been 
scheduled in accordance with the current EMA guideline for pdVWF products. Most sampling time points were 
also scheduled as advised, however, some minor deviation from the guideline is acknowledged without 
affecting PK assessment as demonstrated by consistent data sets for the different trials. As further 
recommended by the guideline, at least three different lots were to be employed in trials evaluating the PK 
of VWF products. 3 different batches of Veyvondi and 1 batch of recombinant anti-haemophilic factor 
(Advate) and pdVWF/FVIII were used in Phase 1 PK study 070701. In Phase 3 study 071001, 5 batches of 
Assessment report

Veyvondi have been used. In the Phase 3 surgery study (071101) 10 batches Veyvondi have been used and 
also four batches were applied in the Phase 1 study in haemophilia A patients. In conclusion, a sufficient 
number of batches of Veyvondi have been applied for PK assessments throughout the clinical development 
program. It was demonstrated that throughout the clinical trials consistent PK data sets could be obtained 
and these are based on a sufficient number of Veyvondi batches. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the data presented for PK characterisation of Veyvondi are considered acceptable.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
A tabular overview of clinical studies with Veyvondi is provided above (Table 1). 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Summary of main efficacy results 
Two phase III trials were performed by the Applicant in two different indications: 
• 
• 
Treatment of bleeding episodes in adults with VWD 
Perioperative management of VWD patients 
Study 071001:  
This was a multicenter, open-label study to assess the PK, safety and efficacy of rVWF:rFVIII and rVWF in 
the treatment of BEs in adult subjects with severe VWD (N = 37). The study consisted of two parts. In part 
A, subjects in Arms 1 and 3 received Veyvondi treatment for PK assessment (i.e. PK50: 50 IU/kg and PK80: 
80 IU/kg) followed by treatment of BEs, subjects in Arm 2 received PK assessment only (PK50) and subjects 
in Arm 4 received treatment of BEs only. In part B of this study, subjects receiving treatment for BEs in Part 
A continued on-demand treatment for BEs for additional 6 months for a total of 12 months. Within the on-
demand treatment regimen of this study, rFVIII was co-administered with the initial dose or Veyvondi if 
baseline FVIII:C level had been below 40% in order to achieve haemostatic FVIII:C levels (40%). 
Subsequent doses of Veyvondi were to be administered alone as long as therapeutic FVIII:C levels were 
maintained. 
Study 071101 (Surgery):  
This was an open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomised trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of Veyvondi with 
or without rFVIII (Advate) in at least 15 adult subjects with severe hereditary VWD undergoing elective 
surgical procedures (VWD Type 1: N=3, Type 2A: N=2, Type 2B: N=1, Type 2M: N=1, Type 3: N=8). At 
least 10 surgical procedures were to be major (defined as surgery which had a significant risk of large 
volume blood loss or blood loss into a confined anatomical space, including extraction of third molars). Minor 
and oral surgical procedures referred to e.g. the placement of intravenous access devices, removal of small 
skin lesions, arthroscopy, gastroscopy, colonoscopy, conisation, or extractions of fewer than three teeth (no 
molars and without bony involvement). Dose and frequency of Veyvondi and FVIII administration depended 
on the type of surgery, PK results, and VWF and FVIII levels.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study 071001: A Phase 3 clinical study to determine the pharmacokinetics, 
safety, and efficacy of rVWF:rFVIII and rVWF in the treatment of bleeding 
episodes in subjects diagnosed with von Willebrand disease 
This prospective, open-label [except for the PK50 arms (single blinded)], part-randomized phase 3 study 
was designed to evaluate the safety, PK, and efficacy of rVWF:rFVIII and rVWF in the treatment of bleeding 
episodes in subjects diagnosed with severe type 3 and severe non-type 3 VWD. 
The study consisted of 2 parts; Part A consisted of PK assessments alone (Arm 2: PK50 only [without 
treatment of BEs]), or PK assessments (Arm 1: PK50 and Arm 3: PK80) plus on-demand treatment period(s) 
of 6 months for BEs, or Arm 4: on-demand treatment for BEs only. Subjects receiving treatment for PK 
assessments and/or BEs in Part A were to be entered into Part B to continue on-demand treatment for BEs 
for 6 additional months for a total of 12 months in the study. 
Approximately 36 to 45 subjects with severe VWD were to be enrolled. A subset consisting of at least 20 
subjects with type 3 VWD was to be included. A total of 49 subjects were enrolled (signed informed consent) 
and screened, 18 subjects were randomized (Arm 1 and Arm 2 [PK50] only), 37 subjects were treated with 
IP (all study arms) and 30 subjects completed the study. 
Of the 37 patients treated 28/37 (75.7%) were on on demand treatment exclusively, 6/37 (16.2%) were on 
prophylaxis exclusively and 3/37 (8.1%) had a combination of both treatments. 
The trial was conducted in 30 study sites in 15 countries.

Treatments 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments:  
Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed in Part A for subjects in PK50 with treatment of BEs (Arm 1), 
PK50 only (Arm 2) and PK80 with treatment of BEs (Arm 3).  
Treatment of BEs: 
BEs were initially treated with an IV infusion of rVWF:rFVIII (ratio 1.3:1±0.2) and subsequently with rVWF 
with or without rFVIII, based on FVIII levels, if available. In cases where no FVIII levels were available, the 
individual subject’s PK data was used to determine the rFVIII dose. In this situation, rFVIII dosing was at the 
discretion of the investigator. Using rFVIII in addition to rVWF in subsequent doses carries the risk of an 
excessive rise in FVIII:C. In order to avoid an excessive rise in FVIII:C, reduced doses and/or prolongation 
of the dose interval were considered. 
Dosage had to be individualised based on the subjects´ weight, type and severity of bleeding episode and 
based on monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures. As a general guidance, 1 IU rVWF/kg 
VWF:RCo raised the circulating level of VWF:RCo by 0.017 IU/ml (1.7 %). Levels of VWF:RCo of > 0.6 IU/ml 
(60%) and of FVIII:C of > 0.4 IU/ml (40%) should be initially achieved. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 48/113 
  
  
 
PK doses were administered at the study site by a trained member of the investigator’s staff.  
Minor and moderate BEs were treated either at the study site, or at home. A subject was considered suitable 
for home treatment only after the subject had received at least 2 infusions of IP in the clinic. Prior to the 
initiation of treatment, the study subject had to contact the investigator for instructions on the dosing 
regimen and an estimate of the number of infusions required to establish hemostatic control. This estimate 
was based on the anatomic location and severity of the bleed and subject’s prior response to pdVWF-
containing concentrates. 
Major BEs were treated only at the study site. Initiating treatment of major BE at home was at the discretion 
of the investigator, the subject however had to visit the study site within 24 hours (up to a maximum of 36 
hours) after start of the BE, preferably before the second infusion.  
Duration of treatment: 
Part A comprised a treatment period of 6 months; during Part B subjects continued treatment for further 6 
months, to provide a total of 12 months of treatment (including Part A). 
The total study duration was 27 months. 
Objectives 
The objectives of this study were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To compare the PK parameters of rVWF alone or concomitantly with rFVIII (Advate) in subjects with 
type 3 VWD 
To examine the PK parameters of rVWF in subjects with severe VWD 
To evaluate the hemostatic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of rVWF:rFVIII and rVWF alone in 
subjects with VWD receiving the investigational product for the treatment of BEs

To assess changes in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 
The following hypothesis was tested on a 5% one-sided level implicitly, by computing the 2-sided exact 
Cloper-Pearson 90% CI of proportions: 
•  Null hypothesis H0: p ≤0.65 
•  Alternative hypothesis HA: p >0.65 
p= Rate of subjects with a treatment success considering all IP-treated Bes The lower limit of the 90% CI 
was compared to the threshold of 65%, implicitly testing the null hypothesis of a success rate of 65% versus 
the one-sided alternative of a success rate of > 65%. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
o  Number of subjects with a treatment success for treated BEs. Treatment success was defined as a 
mean efficacy rating score of <2.5 for a subject’s VEYVONDI-treated BEs during the study. The 
extent of control of the BEs was assessed using the following scores: Excellent = 1; Good = 2; 
Moderate = 3; None = 4 Table 6) 
Secondary endpoints 
o  The number of treated BEs with an efficacy rating of‘excellent’ or ‘good’ 
o  The number of infusions and number of units of rVWF:rFVIII and/or rVWF per BE

Table 6: Efficacy rating scale (study 071001) 
The estimated number of infusions required for treatment of different types of bleeds at various anatomical 
locations was to be determined and individualised by the investigator and using published literature data as 
outlined in the following table. 
Table 7: Number of infusion required for the treatment of BEs in various body systems used for 
investigator guidance 
Subjects had the opportunity to qualify for home treatment. The subject was required to contact the 
investigator within 12 hours from start of treatment and evaluate the home treatment plan. If the 
investigator determined that successful treatment would require more infusions than initially predefined, 
he/she also had to provide a rationale for the selected number of infusions and the objective clinical efficacy 
rating to be adjusted accordingly.

If a subject was not able to liaise with the investigator before escalating treatment, the investigator made a 
retrospective estimate of the number of infusions required, which was recorded as such. In case of major 
bleeds, the subject had to come to the investigational site within 24 (up to max. 36) hours after bleeding 
onset. The investigator assisted in estimating the number of infusions required and rated the efficacy 
according to the scale based on the immediate medical history. 
The following table compares bleeding characteristics between prospectively and retrospectively assessed 
efficacy ratings.  
In any case, subjects were asked additionally to subjectively assess hemostatic efficacy at 45 min ± 15 min, 
at 2 hours ± 15 min, at 8 hours ± 30 min, and at 24 hours ± 60 min from start of IP infusion using the 4-
scale rating system outlined below.

Sample size 
A total of 49 subjects with severe VWD were enrolled. 18 subjects were randomized (Arm 1 and Arm 2 
[PK50] only), 37 subjects were treated with IP (all study arms) and 30 subjects completed the study. 
Study Protocol (Global Amendment 2) which was finalised before the start of the trial, the sample size is pre-
specified as follows: 
The study consists of four arms that vary with the dose of IP administered and whether the subjects will 
receive IP treatment for PK assessments alone, IP treatment for PK assessments and for bleeding episodes, 
or IP treatment for bleeding episodes only. For PK assessments, two of the four arms will receive 50 IU/kg IP 
and a third arm will receive 80 IU/kg IP. The fourth and last arm will receive IP treatment only for bleeding 
episodes (no PK assessments). 
Approximately 36 -45 adult subjects (32 subjects completing Part A and Part B) will be comprised of subsets 
of VWD 
[...] 
8.1.1.1 Arm 1: PK 50 Arm with Treatment of bleeding episodes 
In Arm 1, the PK 50 Arm with treatment, at least 7 severe VWD subjects will be randomized to one of two 
treatment groups (Group 1 or Group 2). 
[...] 
8.1.1.2 Arm 2: PK 50 without Treatment of bleeding episodes 
In Arm 2, the PK 50 Arm without treatment, at least 7 severe vWD subjects will be randomized to one of two 
treatment groups (Group 1 or Group 2) 
[...] 
8.1.1.3 Arm 3: PK80 Arm with Treatment of bleeding episodes 
In Arm 3, PK 80 with treatment, a minimum of 22 severe subjects with severe VWD will receive 2 infusions 
of rVWF. 
[...] 
Each subject will then undergo ≥ 6 months of on demand treatment for bleeding episodes. A second PK 
assessment will then be conducted following infusion of 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo rVWF. Each subject will then 
undergo an on demand treatment for bleeding episodes for additional 6 months. All subjects entering the PK 
80 arm will be treated for bleeding episodes for a total of 12 months after the initial IP infusion. 
[...] 
8.1.1.4 Arm 4: Treatment of bleeding episodes only 
In Arm 4, subjects (minimum of 7 subjects independent of VWD subtype) will receive on demand IP 
treatment for bleeding episodes for a total period of 12 months from screening. 
On page 96 of the study Protocol (Global Amendment 3) following sample size considerations are put 
forward: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 53/113 
  
  
For the primary endpoint, the null hypothesis of the rate of subjects with a treatment success of >0.65 (H0: 
p ≤0.65) versus an alternative hypothesis of ≤0.65 (HA: p>0.65) will be tested at the 5% level of 
significance. The proportion of subjects with treatment success under the alternative hypothesis is expected 
to be approximately 0.90. If 20 subjects were treated the study provides 86% power to reject the null 
hypothesis. To assess the secondary efficacy endpoint, the null hypothesis of the rate of excellent/good 
efficacy ratings for all IP-treated bleeding episodes of ≤0.6 (H0: p ≤0.6) versus an alternative hypothesis of 
≤0.6 (HA: p>0.6) will be tested at the 5% level of significance. The proportion of excellent/good treatment 
outcomes for all IP-treated bleeding episodes under the alternative hypothesis is expected to be 
approximately 0.85. If 30 bleeding episodes are treated the study provides >90% power to reject the above 
null hypothesis. 
Randomisation 
Subjects across the PK 50 Arms 1 (PK 50 with Treatment) and 2 (PK 50 only) (includes Type 3 VWD subjects 
only) were randomised (within each Arm) at a ratio of 1:1 to one of two treatment regimens. Randomization 
was assigned according to a predetermined central randomization list. The randomization list was generated 
by the Sponsor’s statistician using the random number generator algorithm of Wichmann and Hill (1981) as 
modified by McLeod (1985). Subjects in Arm 1 (PK 50 with treatment) and Arm 2 (PK 50 only) were 
randomised to receive either VWF and rFVIII or VWF and saline (placebo) for their initial infusion followed by 
a washout of 18±10 days and then cross-over to the alternative treatment schedule. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study subjects and study investigators were blinded with respect to the randomization and the IP 
administered as part of each study infusion in Arm 1 (PK50 with treatment of BEs) and Arm 2 (PK50 only). 
To maintain the blind IP was reconstituted by a third party, preferably by the hospital pharmacist, who had 
to provide reconstituted IP to the investigator ready for infusion. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
Safety Dataset 
The Safety Dataset was defined as all subjects who received any amount of IP: rVWF:rFVIII or rVWF alone. 
Full Analysis Dataset 
The Full Analysis Dataset (FAS) was defined as all subjects for whom at least one efficacy rating scale 
assessment is available for an IP-treated bleeding episode.

control bleeding 
2. The subject, who participates in the treatment for bleeding episodes, has had a minimum of 1 
documented bleed (medical history) requiring VWF coagulation factor replacement therapy during the 
previous 12 months prior to enrollment. 
4. The subject is at least 18 and not older than 65 years of age at enrollment 
7. Subject is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol and who did not meet study 
exclusion criteria 
1.  The subject has been diagnosed with pseudo VWD or another hereditary or acquired coagulation 
disorder other than VWD (eg qualitative and quantitative platelet disorders or elevated PT/international 
normalized ratio [INR] >1.4). 
2.  The subject has a documented history of a VWF:RCo half-life of >6 hours. 
The subject has a history or presence of aVWF inhibitor at screening. 
3.  The subject has a history or presence of a factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitor with a titer ≥0.4 BU (by 
Nijmegen assay) or ≥ 0.6 BU (by Bethesda assay).  
Bleeds that might impact efficacy assessments (such as specific protocol deviations relating to IP 
administration, incorrect dose) will be excluded from the PP Analysis Dataset. 
Bleeding episodes for which pdVWF(/FVIII) had to be used because rVWF/rFVIII was not available, will only 
be considered for the safety analysis and not taken into account for the analysis of efficacy. 
Bleeding episodes for which the investigator had to make a retrospective estimate of the number of infusion 
required because the subject was not able to liaise with the investigator before escalating treatment, will not 
be taken into account for the primary analysis of efficacy. These bleeding episodes will only be included in a 
sensitivity analysis carried out for the efficacy outcome measure relating to the investigator’s efficacy rating. 
The definition of the PP analysis set was modified later as follows:  
The definition of the PP analysis dataset was re-defined: in case of a major protocol deviation that is related 
to a single bleed, then only this single bleed will be excluded, but not the whole subject (bleeds can be seen 
as independent from each other). In addition, at least one efficacy rating scale assessment is sufficient that 
the subject is included in the PP analysis dataset. 
“Per Protocol Set (PP) 
Of 22 subjects in the FAS, 17 were included in the PP analysis set as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
version 2014 MAR 18: 5 subjects (320002, 450001, 490001, 510001, 690001) were excluded from the PP 
analysis set because of one or more major protocol deviations that could have a potential impact on efficacy 
assessments, such as specific protocol deviations relating to IP administration, or incorrect dose. BEs from 
subjects that were included in the FAS but not in the PP analysis set are provided in Listing 5.” 
Missing data 
According to the statistical analysis plan, missing efficacy rating scores as determined by the investigator will 
not be replaced and thus will not be considered in the calculation of the mean efficacy rating score.  
Considering the secondary outcome measure haemostatic efficacy the following missing data strategy was 
employed: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 55/113 
  
  
Hemostatic efficacy ratings were estimated for the rate of all IP-treated bleeding episodes with 
excellent/good treatment outcome within a general estimating equation (GEE) model framework. The GEE 
model did not fit as the treatment success rate was 100%. A GEE model using a “worst case” analysis” 
where missing efficacy ratings counted as “no success” and Clopper-Pearson CI was calculated with BEs 
counted as independent events showed the overall treatment success rate was 0.99 (90% CI: 0.98 to 1.00) 
for prospective estimates from the investigator excluding GIs. Comparable results were obtained using a 
95% CI for the estimate of treatment success within the GEE model. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
Point estimates and corresponding two-sided exact CIs according to Clopper-Pearson at the 90% confidence 
level were calculated for the rate of subjects with a treatment success considering all IP-treated BEs. The 
analysis was carried out twice; based on all treated BEs and based on treated BEs other than GI bleeds. The 
analysis excluding GI bleeds was considered the primary efficacy assessment. The primary efficacy analysis 
was based on the FAS. As a supportive analysis, the same analysis will also to be carried out on the PP 
analysis dataset. The following hypothesis was tested on a 5% one-sided level implicitly, by computing the 
2-sided exact Clopper-Pearson 90% CI of proportions:  
•  Null hypothesis H0: p ≤0.65 
•  Alternative hypothesis HA: p >0.65 
p= Rate of subjects with a treatment success considering all IP-treated BEs The lower limit of the 90% CI 
was compared to the threshold of 65%, implicitly testing the null hypothesis of a success rate of 65% versus 
the one-sided alternative of a success rate of > 65%. 
Secondary efficacy analysis

The following hypothesis was tested on a 5% one-sided level implicitly, by estimating the two-sided 
90% CI of the rate of all IP-treated BEs with excellent or good treatment outcome within the GEE 
model: 
Null hypothesis H0: p ≤0.60 
•  Alternative hypothesis HA: p >0.60 p = Rate of IP-treated BEs with excellent or good treatment 
outcome according to the efficacy rating scale 
In addition, BEs were considered independent, and point estimates and corresponding two-sided exact CIs 
according to Clopper-Pearson at the 90% confidence level were calculated for the rate of all IP-treated BEs 
with excellent or good treatment outcome according to the efficacy rating scale as determined by the 
investigator.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendments 
The original protocol (dated 8 April 2011) and the first protocol amendments (dated 26 August 2011 [Japan] 
+ 15 November 2011 [all other countries except Japan]) were issued before the enrolment of the first 
subject on 17 November 2011. There were 4 additional protocol amendments during the course of the study, 
2 for Japan and 2 for all other countries except Japan. 
Main amendments: change of study title; Deleted the prevention of bleeding episodes; Changed the 
requirement, that subjects can be enrolled with 6 previous treated bleeding episodes within 3 years, instead 
of 2 years; The study arm requiring PK50 assessments and treatment of bleeding episodes for 12 months in 
type 3 VWD was split in three study arms: PK50 plus treatment (type 3 VWD), PK50 only (type 3 VWD) and 
Treatment of bleeding episodes only (all VWD subtypes); the subset for comparison of intra-subject PK of 
VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:Ag was changed to include at least 20 subjects; PK assessment: More and 
detailed information provided for subjects on prophylactic therapy; Treatment of BE: More and detailed 
information provided for this procedure and outlining of criteria to be considered for subjects, who start 
home treatment; Subjects have to be exposed twice to rVWF, which can be accomplished either by treating 
the first two bleeding episodes at the investigational site or been exposed a second time to rVWF at the end 
of the PK80 assessment; Repeat rVWF exposures visits for subjects only participating for the treatment of 
bleeding episodes: Subjects require two exposures to rVWF prior to initiating home treatment of bleeding 
episodes; A bleeding episode is considered resolved, if no additional treatment is required for the next 48 
hours; Any bleeding episode treated only with pdVWF(/FVIII) coagulation concentrates do not require an 
efficacy rating and are not followed up as mandated by the protocol for bleeding episodes treated with rVWF. 
If rVWF is not available for various reasons, which has to be documented at minimum by the investigational 
site, and pdVWF(/FVIII) has to be used instead, the event will only be considered for the safety analysis and 
not taken into account for the analysis of efficacy; Study Flow Charts were updated and the Karnofsky Score 
and NYHA Classification was added. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 820 protocol violations were reported in 39 subjects during the study; of which 84 (10.2%) were 
defined as major and 736 (89.8%) were defined as minor.  
Protocol deviations totals by category/type were: 
• 
Eligibility (1 deviation in 1 subject) 
•  Randomization (9 deviations in 9 subjects) 
• 
• 
• 
IP administration (141 deviations in 26 subjects) 
Protocol Schedule (361 deviations in 35 subjects) 
Procedure not done (300 deviations in 39 subjects) 
•  Other (8 deviations in 6 subjects) 
Nine subjects were enrolled although they did not meet inclusion criteria or met an exclusion criterion; all 
but one (subject 690001) were discontinued from the study. 
It was prospectively planned to exclude bleeds from the PP analysis set such as specific major protocol 
deviations relating to IP administration, incorrect dose. Five subjects (320002, 450001, 490001, 510001, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 58/113 
  
  
690001) were excluded due to major protocol deviations associated with IP administration, and individual 
bleeds were excluded from the PP analysis for 4 additional subjects. 
Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline characteristics are described for the Full Analysis Set (all subjects with at least 
1 available efficacy rating scale assessment for an IP-treated bleeding episode). All subjects had been 
diagnosed with VWD. The majority of subjects (17/22 [77.3%]) had type 3 VWD; 4 (18.2%) subjects had 
type 2A VWD, and 1 (4.5%) subject had type 2N VWD. None of the subjects had type 1 VWD. 
The mean age at screening was 34 years (range 18 to 64 years). Mean weight was 75 kg (range 50 to 105 
kg), and the mean height was 168 cm (range 155 to 185 cm) in the FAS. Subjects were well distributed by 
gender (10/22 [45.5%] male and 12/22 [54.5%] female). Most subjects (90.9%) were white and the rest 
(9.1%) were Asian. Two subjects (9.1%) were Hispanic or Latino. 
Medical History 
All 37 subjects of the Safety Analysis Set (all subjects who received any amount of IP) were previously 
treated. The majority of subjects 28/37 (75.7%) had exclusively on-demand prior treatment while 6/37 
(16.2%) had exclusively prophylactic treatment and 3/37 (8.1%) had a combination of both prophylaxis and 
on-demand prior to study entry. 
Numbers analysed 
Safety Analysis Set (SAS) 
The safety analysis set (SAS) was comprised of all 37 subjects who were exposed at least once to IP 
(rVWF:rFVIII or rVWF alone). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 59/113 
  
  
 
 
 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
Of the 37 subjects treated, 22 subjects for whom at least one efficacy rating scale assessment was available 
for an IP-treated bleeding episode were included in the FAS; 7 subjects had no BEs treated with IP and 8 
subjects were included in Arm 2 (PK50 only) with no treatment of BEs. 
Per Protocol Set (PP) 
Of 22 subjects in the FAS, 17 were included in the PP analysis set as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
version 2014 MAR 18: 5 subjects (320002, 450001, 490001, 510001, 690001) were excluded from the PP 
analysis set because of one or more major protocol deviations that could have a potential impact on efficacy 
assessments, such as specific protocol deviations relating to IP administration, or incorrect dose.  
Outcomes and estimation 
A total of 193 BEs that occurred in 22 subjects (17 with type 3 VWD, 4 with type 2A VWD and 1 with type 
2N VWD). 192 BEs were treated with IP. The majority of bleeds were mucosal (107), followed by joint bleeds 
(59). A total of 37 bleeds occurred in other locations (e.g., superficial, body cavity, soft tissue and muscle). 
Six bleeds occurred in the GI tract. Mucosal bleeds were further analysed in sub-categories of ‘mucosal and 
genital tract and female’ (32), ‘mucosal and nasopharyngeal tract’ (42) and ‘mucosal and mouth and oral 
cavity’ (26).  
Of the 193 BEs, 166 (86.0%) BEs were spontaneous, 26 (13.5%) BEs were traumatic and 1 (0.5%) BE was 
of unknown cause.  
There were 122 (63.2%) minor BEs, 62 (32.1%) moderate BEs and 7 (3.6%) major/severe BEs. Seven 
major/severe BEs occurred in 5 unique subjects (3 major/severe BEs in subject 450001 [left hip, left 
shoulder and GI tract], and 1 major/severe BE per subject 540001 [nasopharyngeal tract], 540002 [genital 
tract], 860002 [GI tract], 870001 [left elbow]).

Primary Outcome Measure – Treatment Success 
The primary outcome measure was the number of subjects with “treatment success,” which was defined as a 
mean efficacy rating score of < 2.5 taking into account all bleeding episodes in a subject treated with rVWF 
(with or without Advate) during the study period. 
The rate of subjects with treatment success was 100% (Clopper-Pearson exact 90% CI: 84.7 to 100.0 and 
Clopper-Pearson exact 95% CI 81.5 to 100.0) for bleeds where the assessments were made prospectively 
and excluding GI bleeds. Results of the PP analysis set support the primary efficacy analysis of the FAS 
(Clopper- Pearson exact 90% CI: 81.9 to 100.0). 
Sensitivity analyses of treatment success for BEs including GI bleeds and those BEs for which the 
investigator had to make retrospective estimates of the number of infusion required, had a 100% treatment 
success rate for each scenario analysed at 90% CI and 95% CI. No substantial difference in the 90% CI and 
95% CI of treatment success rate was observed between prospective vs. retrospective investigator 
assessments, nor for inclusion or exclusion of GI bleeds in the analysis.  
193 BEs, of which 166 were spontaneous, occurred in 22 subjects (VWD Type 3, N=17; Type 2A, N=4; Type 
2N, N=1). 107 BEs where mucosal, 59 allocated to joints and 6 were GI bleeds. 37 bleeds occurred in other 
Assessment report

locations (e.g. superficial, body cavity, soft tissue and muscle). One bleed was excluded from the analysis 
due to treatment with another VWF product. 122 BEs were minor, and 62 of moderate and 7 of major 
severity. BEs of major severity comprised 3 BEs in one subject (located to the hip, shoulder and GI tract), 1 
BE in the nasopharyngeal tract in one subject, 1 BE in the genital tract in one subject, 1 BE in the GI tract in 
one subject, and 1 BE located to the elbow in one subject. The rate of subjects (N=20) with treatment 
success was 95% (95% CI: 75.1 to 99.9) for bleeds where the assessments were made prospectively and 
including GI bleeds. Treatment success was defined as a mean efficacy rating score of <2.5 for a subject’s 
BEs using an ordinal, 4-point rating scale of haemostatic efficacy (Excellent=1, Good=2, Moderate=3, 
None=4). To analyse specific bleeding patterns (menorrhagia, epistaxis and oral), subgroup analyses of BEs 
by mucosal bleeding location are provided further supporting primary efficacy results, i.e. 95.6% of mucosal 
and genital tract and female bleeds (n=45), 97.6% of mucosal and nasopharyngeal tract bleeds (n=42), and 
100.0% mucosal and mouth and oral cavity bleeds (n=26) had an excellent efficacy rating. Only 25% of 
major mucosal bleeds (N=4) received a rating of excellent. The remaining 3 major mucosal BEs received an 
efficacy rating of “moderate”. Sensitivity analyses of treatment success for BEs excluding GI bleeds are 
consistent with the primary analysis. In detail, the proportion of subjects with treatment success and for 
whom investigator's initial estimate was made prospectively excluding GI bleeds was 100% (95% CI was 
81.5 to 100.0, N=18/18). If initial estimate was made prospectively or retrospectively similar results were 
observed, i.e. 95.5% (95% CI was 77.2 to 99.9, N=21/22). A sensitivity analysis counting subject 510001 
for whom treatment had to be stopped due to AE and who was subsequently withdrawn from the study as 
treatment failure results in an estimate for the success rate of 90.9% (95%CI: 70.8 to 98.9, N=20/22). 
Thus, estimated treatment success rates were observed to be above 90% with lower confidence bounds 
above 70% for prospective/retrospective investigator assessments, or for inclusion/exclusion of GI bleeds, 
and worst case imputation of missing values. 
Secondary outcome measures - number of treated BEs with an efficacy rating of‘excellent’ or ‘
good’ 
The proportion of Veyvondi-treated BEs (including GI bleeds) with an ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ efficacy rating was 
97.7% (127/130, Clopper-Pearson exact 95% CI: 93.4 to 99.5). Haemostatic efficacy was rated excellent in 
184/192 (95.8%), good in 4/192 (2.1%) moderate in 3/192 (1.6%) and none in 1/192 (0.5%) BEs. 
Regarding efficacy rating by VWD subtype, haemostatic efficacy was excellent for 14/16 (87.5%) good for 
1/16 (6.3%) and moderate for 1/16 (6.3%) BEs in 4 subjects of Type 2A VWD. Haemostatic efficacy was 
rated excellent for the one BE experienced by one Type 2N VWD subject. For the 17 Type 3 VWD subjects 
BEs were rated excellent for 169/175 (96.6%), good for 3 (1.7%), moderate for 2 (1.1%) and none for 1 
(0.6%) BEs. A sub-analysis of efficacy rating by bleed location showed that 57/59 (96.6%) ratings of 
excellent, 1 (1.7%) of good, and 1 (1.7) of none 1 were reported for of joint bleeds, 4/6 (66.7%) excellent, 
1 good (16.7%) and 1 moderate (16.7%) efficacy ratings were reported for GI. Similar ratings were reported 
for mucosal bleeds (112/117, 95.7% rated excellent; 2, 1.7% good; and 3, 2.6% moderate). 
Secondary outcome measures - number of infusions and number of units of rVWF:rFVIII and/or 
rVWF per BE 
The median number of infusions for the treatment of BEs was 1.0 (90% CI, 1.0 to 1.0) infusion for 192 BEs. 
Of these, 157/192 (81.8%) BEs were treated with one infusion of Veyvondi alone or in combination with 
rFVIII and 2, 3 and 4 infusions were required to control 25/192, 9/192 and 1/192 BEs, respectively. For BE 
treatment, Veyvondi was to be used in combination with rFVIII for the initial infusion (182/192, 94.8%) 
whereas 10 (5.2%) BEs were initially treated with Veyvondi alone. For subsequent infusions, Veyvondi alone 
was more frequently used than in combination with rFVIII, i.e. 60.0% (21/35) of second infusions, 80.0% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 62/113 
  
  
(8/10) of third infusions, and 100.0% (1/1) of fourth infusions were with Veyvondi alone. A sub-analysis of 
mucosal BEs showed a slightly higher number of bleeds that occurred in the female genital tract required 
more than one infusion (5/32, 15.6%) than mucosal bleeds in the nasopharyngeal tract (1/30, 2.4%), and 
there were 3 bleeds in the mouth and oral cavity that required more than 2 infusions. Characteristics of BEs 
by severity are provided in Table 8 showing that the number of infusions required to control a BE is higher 
with increased bleeding severity. The number of infusions stratified by VWD subtype is shown in Table 9 
Units per BE, mean and median doses of rVWF and rVWF:rFVIII are provided Table 10.

ratings 
Further analysis of Veyvondi units required to control BEs ranked by severity is provided as follows: 
-  Minor BEs (n=122): Mean 49.4 ± 18.08 IU/kg; Median 43.3 (range, 25.2 to 158.2) IU/kg 
-  Moderate BEs (n=61): Mean 66.8 ± 39.40 IU/kg; Median 52.7 (range, 23.8 to184.9) IU/kg 
-  Major BEs (n=7): Mean 103.5 ± 28.46 IU/kg; Median 100.00 (range, 57.5 to 135.0) IU/kg 
-  Unknown severity (n=2): Mean 33.4 ± 0.46 IU/kg; Median 33.4 (range, 33.1 to 33.8) IU/kg 
Another sub-analysis is provided to show the number of units of VEYVONDI and rFVIII required per BE in 
relation to the bleeding location (median and range): 
-  Mucosal bleeds (n=96): rVWF 43.3 (23.8 to 184.9) IU/kg, rFVIII 30.6 (16.6 to 61.3) IU/kg  
- 
Joint bleeds (n=51): rVWF 48.2 (23.8 to 139.6) IU/kg, rFVIII 34.9 (16.6 to 129.3) IU/kg  
-  Other location (n=37): rVWF 52.2 (25.2 to 184.9) IU/kg, rFVIII 36.8 (17.6 to 86.2) IU/kg  
-  GI bleeds (n=6): rVWF 60.0 (53.6 to 121.1) IU/kg, rFVIII 33.2 (19.3 to 49.4) IU/kg   
Of the mucosal bleeds, median dose for BE treatment was lowest for mucosal and nasopharyngeal tract BEs, 
i.e. 40.4 (23.8 to 90.2) IU/kg for rVWF and 28.7 (16.6 to 49.3) IU/kg for rFVIII, and highest for mucosal 
and mouth and oral cavity, i.e. 50.2 (23.8 to 184.9) IU/kg for rVWF and 36.9 (16.6 to 51.9) IU/kg for rFVIII. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 65/113 
  
  
 
 
For mucosal and genital tract and female BEs, median dose range was 43.3 (39.9 to 95.1) IU/kg for rVWF 
and 30.6 (28.1 to 61.3) IU/kg for rFVIII. For male subjects, median doses for BE treatment were slightly 
higher, i.e. 48.2 IU/kg for rVWF and 35.2 for rFVIII, as for female subjects, i.e. 43.3 IU/kg for rVWF and 
31.2 for rFVIII. Mean and median time to resolution of a BE was 14.81 hours (± 29.32) and 1.58 hours 
(90% CI, 1.33 to 2.48). The wide range of time to resolution in these values was considered to be attributed 
by variability in bleeding type, location, and severity. 
Trial 071101: A phase 3 prospective, multicenter study to evaluate efficacy and safety of rVWF 
with or without ADVATE in elective surgical procedures in subjects with severe von Willebrand 
disease 
Methods 
This prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized phase 3 surgery study was designed to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of rVWF with or without rFVIII (Advate) as prophylactic treatment in at least 15 adult 
subjects with severe VWD undergoing major, minor, or oral elective surgical procedures. At least 10 
surgeries were to be major. 
Major surgeries were defined as surgery which had a significant risk of large volume blood loss or blood loss 
into a confined anatomical space, including extraction of third molars. Minor surgeries referred to 
interventions such as placement of intravenous access devices, removal of small skin lesions, arthroscopy, 
gastroscopy, colonoscopy or conisation. Oral surgeries comprised extractions of fewer than three teeth, if the 
teeth were non-molars and had no bony involvement. 
The trial was conducted in 14 study sites in 10 countries.

Treatments 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments (major surgery only): Pharmacokinetic assessments were to be performed 
with 50±5 IU rVWF:RCo/kg within 42 days prior to the planned surgery to guide the preoperative priming 
dose. Study subjects planned for major surgery initially undergo a 72 hour baseline PK assessment whereas 
subjects planned for minor and oral surgery directly proceeded to the priming infusion after screening. 
Preoperative Priming Dose 
12- 24 hours prior to surgery, a priming dose with rVWF, using the rVWF and Advate IR and T1/2 for this 
subject, was infused to allow the endogenous FVIII levels to raise to at least 30 IU/dL (minor, oral surgery), 
or 60 IU/dL (major surgery) at the time of the initial preoperative loading dosing. 
As a general guidance a priming dose of 40-60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo was administered. If not assessed prior to 
the preoperative priming dose, a IR recovery was calculated for subjects undergoing minor and oral surgery. 
Preoperative Loading Dose 
VWF and FVIII levels should be assessed within 3 hours prior to surgery initiation and results must be 
available prior to administering the loading dose. If FVIII levels prior to loading dose administration were not 
at least 30 IU/dL (minor, oral surgery), or 60 IU/dL (major surgery) Advate was administered in addition to 
rVWF in order to raise FVIII:C levels to recommended levels. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 69/113 
  
  
Intra- and Postoperative (maintenance) Dosing 
After the preoperative loading dose(s), subjects who have not achieved the desired post-infusion recovery 
will continue to receive rVWF with or without Advate as a bolus infusion, depending on VWF and FVIII levels. 
The peri- and postoperative substitution regimen will be individualized according to the PK results, intensity 
and duration of the hemostatic challenge and the institution’s standard of care. 
To determine the adequacy of VWF and FVIII replacement subjects will have blood samples drawn pre- and 
post rVWF /Advate infusions once every 24 hours or every other day for measurement of plasma VWF and 
FVIII activity. 
Dose modifications based on pre-infusion VWF/FVIII levels will be performed as needed.

using an ordinal scale of hemostatic efficacy (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate”, or “none”) 
Severity of bleedings observed during surgery, need for additional hemostatic medications, blood loss during 
surgery and postoperative bleedings were considered. Observations were compared to expected rates in a 
hemostatically normal subject if having undergone the same surgical procedure. 
Preoperatively the estimated number of treatment days was estimated by the investigator and recorded. 
Postoperatively the estimated number of treatment days was adjusted based on the surgery and outcomes.

Sample size 
The sample size was determined by the number of subjects requiring elective major, minor, and oral surgical 
procedures according to the Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Human Plasma Derived Von Willebrand 
Factor Products (CPMB/BPWG/220/02) and was not based on statistical considerations. The Guideline 
requires at least 15 subjects with severe VWD, of whom at least 10 were to undergo major surgical 
procedures. 
A total of 24 subjects were enrolled in the study. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
Analysis Sets  
All analysis sets, excluding the PPAS, were to be determined programmatically. Prior to database lock a data 
review meeting was to be scheduled to discuss all major protocol deviations and the influence of the 
deviation on the PPAS. Subjects to be included in the PPAS were to be agreed upon at this meeting and 
approved before the database was locked. 
All Subjects Enrolled Set (ENR)  
The all subjects enrolled (ENR) set comprised all subjects that signed informed consent. Therefore, this 
analysis set was to contain all subjects with “Date informed consent signed” completed in the Informed 
Consent eCRF form.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
The full analysis set (FAS) comprised all subjects included in the safety analysis set (SAF; ie, received any 
amount of IP) with at least one hemostatic assessment (overall assessment 24 hours after last infusion of 
study drug or at Completion Visit, intraoperative actual versus predicted blood loss at completion of surgery, 
intraoperative hemostatic efficacy at completion of surgery). Therefore, this analysis set was to contain all 
subjects with at least one of the following data points available:  
•  Overall Primary Hemostatic Efficacy Rating.  
• 
• 
Intraoperative Actual versus Predicted Blood Loss Rating.  
Intraoperative Hemostatic Efficacy Rating.  
The FAS is the primary analysis set for efficacy evaluations.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 73/113 
  
  
The PPAS comprised all subjects with available overall assessment of haemostatic efficacy assessed by the 
investigator 24 hours after last infusion of study drug or at Completion Visit. Only subjects who met all study 
entry criteria and who had no major protocol violations that might impact haemostatic efficacy were to be 
included in the PPAS. The PPAS was to be discussed and approved at a data review meeting prior to 
database lock. A separate analysis assignment document was to be set up defining major protocol violations.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS)  
The PK analysis set (PKAS) comprised all subjects who underwent a PK assessment and have at least 1 post 
dose concentration without protocol deviations or events with potential to affect PK. The PK scientist was to 
evaluate the strategy for dealing with data affected by protocol deviations at the time of the data review 
meeting prior to database lock before any analysis was performed.  
Safety Analysis Set (SAF)  
The SAF comprised all subjects included in the ENR set that received any amount of IP (rVWF with or without 
Advate). Therefore, this analysis set was to contain all subjects who received any study infusions of rVWF 
with or without Advate (excluding PK infusions and priming); received the preoperative priming dose; or had 
baseline PK assessments. 
Missing data 
Unless otherwise specified, missing data were not to be imputed. Subjects with partial data were to be 
evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if sufficient data were available for meaningful analysis. Any 
decisions on exclusion of data were to be made prior to database lock. All available data were to be included 
in the safety analysis. 
In the situation where the event date is partial or missing, the date was to appear partial or missing in the 
listings. Imputations on dates for AEs and medications were to be performed. Missing data were to be 
presented as a ‘Not reported’ in outputs. 
Statistical techniques 
Primary efficacy analysis 
Primary Outcome Measure  
The overall assessment of haemostatic efficacy of rVWF with or without Advate was to be assessed by the 
investigator (haemophilia physician) 24 hours after last perioperative infusion of study drug or at Completion 
Visit Day 14 (whichever occurs first) using the hemostatic efficacy rating scale (“excellent”, “good”, 
“moderate”, or “none”). The efficacy of rVWF alone and rVWF:Advate was not compared in this study. 
Tabulations of haemostatic efficacy were to include overall primary haemostatic efficacy ratings (“excellent”, 
“good”, “moderate”, or “none”) and grouped overall haemostatic efficacy ratings (“excellent/good” or 
“moderate/none”). Descriptive statistical analysis on the overall primary efficacy rating was to be presented. 
The analysis was to include point estimates and 90% confidence levels for the rate of subjects with a 
grouped overall efficacy rating as “excellent/good”. The point estimates and 90% confidence intervals were 
to be determined from a Clopper-Pearson test in SAS.

Preoperatively, the predicted intraoperative blood loss, based on a hemostatically normal individual of the 
same sex, age, stature and co-morbidities as the subject was to be estimated by the operating surgeon. 
Intraoperative actual blood loss versus predicted blood loss (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate”, or “none”) and 
intraoperative hemostatic efficacy (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate”, or “none”) were to be recorded by the 
operating surgeon. Tabulations of predicted and actual blood loss and predicted treatment days were to 
include the following:  
•  Surgeon’s predicted estimated maximum intraoperative blood loss for this surgical procedure based 
on System Organ Class for a hemostatic normal individual.  
•  Actual estimated intraoperative blood loss.  
• 
Percentage of blood loss relative to hemostatic normal individual.  
•  Hematologists preoperative predicted number of treatment days for a patient with subject’s VWD 
type and procedure.  
•  Whether the predicted number of treatment days were reassessed postoperatively.  
•  Adjusted treatment days, including rationale for adjustment and specification if treatment duration is 
greater than 14 days. Tabulations of intraoperative hemostatic efficacy were to include the following:  
• 
Intraoperative actual versus predicted blood loss rating.  
•  Grouped intraoperative actual versus predicted blood loss rating.  
• 
Intraoperative hemostatic efficacy rating.  
•  Grouped intraoperative hemostatic efficacy rating.  
Summaries were to be presented for actual blood loss and percentage of actual blood loss relative to 
predicted blood loss. 
Descriptive statistical analysis on the intraoperative efficacy ratings was to be presented. The analysis was to 
include point estimates and 90% CIs for the rate of subjects with a grouped overall efficacy rating as 
“excellent/good”. The point estimates and 90% CIs were to be determined from a Clopper-Pearson test in 
the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). Confidence intervals were only to be presented for overall summaries 
and not for summaries by subgroups. A comparative analysis between the ratings for overall primary 
haemostatic efficacy, intraoperative haemostatic efficacy, and intraoperative actual versus predicted blood 
loss rating was to be presented descriptively. A summary of average daily and total weight-adjusted doses 
(average through postoperative Day 14) of rVWF with or without Advate per subject was to be provided 
using median, quartiles, and range. In addition, any VWD-related BEs that did not result in other AEs were 
to be assessed as part of the efficacy assessments since they are part of the underlying disease. Tabulations 
and summaries of BEs were to include the anatomical bleeding site (joint, gastrointestinal, mucosal, soft 
tissue, or other); cause of BE (traumatic, postoperative, or unknown); severity of BE (minor, moderate, or 
severe); whether BE was excessive and unexplained; the number of infusions and amount of infusions of 
rVWF and/or Advate required to treat BE (if applicable), and time to resolution of BE.

The various types of severe VWD that are eligible for the study were clarified to include VWD with a 
history of requiring substitution therapy containing VWF to control bleeding; Type 1 (VWF:RCoF < 20 
IU/dL); Type 2A (as verified by multimer pattern), Type 2B (as diagnosed by genotype), Type 2N 
(FVIII:C<10% and historically documented genetics), and Type 2M; or Type 3 (VWF:Ag ≤ 3 IU/dL). 
The option to give a priming dose of rVWF 12-24 hours before surgery was deleted to reduce the 
number of different dose regimens investigated. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was updated to include intra- and post-operative actual versus 
predicted blood loss; and overall assessment of clinical (hemostatic) efficacy at 24 hours after last 
infusion of IP. Furthermore, it was made mandatory that the surgeon documents predicted values 
with a source data document to strengthen the quality of the predicted average and maximum blood 
loss. 
Two options for administration of the combination of rVWF and rFVIII were added to ease 
reconstitution and mixing of study drugs. 
o  Option 1: Infusion of premixed drug 
o  Option 2: Sequential infusion 
Treatment success was defined as a mean primary efficacy rating score of <2 for a subject’s IP-
covered surgery, dental, or invasive procedure (Excellent = 1, Good = 2, Moderate = 3, None = 4). 
Summary of Significant Changes Adopted with Protocol Amendment 2 (2013 Nov 27) 
• 
• 
Throughout the protocol, wording on analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures was 
adjusted to reflect revised primary and secondary objectives. 
Primary hemostatic efficacy assessment rating scale was revised to reflect the authority’s feedback 
(inclusion of objective measure of cessation of bleeding). 
•  Completion visit was changed from 30 days (± 3 days) after the last IP infusion to 14 days (± 2 
days) after surgery to standardize treatment duration and evaluation of primary efficacy endpoint. 
• 
The priming dose VWF infusion 12-24 hours prior surgery included in the original protocol and 
deleted in Global Amendment 1 was reintroduced to improve the IP treatment scheme. 
Summary of Significant Changes Adopted with Protocol Amendment 3 (2015 Mar 19) 
• 
The sponsor name/entity was changed. 
Protocol deviations 
60 deviations were reported in 20 (83.3%) subjects during the study. Five (5) in 4 (16.7%) subjects were 
major and 55 in 20 (83.3%) were minor. The major deviations included 3 informed consent violations in 3 
subjects, 1 SAE criteria violation, and 1 concomitant medication criteria violation.

Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline characteristics are described for the Full Analysis Set (all 15 treated subjects). 
All subjects had been diagnosed with VWD. The majority of subjects (8/15 [53.3%]) had Type 3 VWD; 3 
(20.0%) had Type 1 VWD, 2 (13.3%) had Type 2A VWD, 1 (6.7%) had Type 2B VWD, and 1 (6.7%) had 
Type 2M VWD. 
The mean age at screening was 39.3 years (range 20.0 to 70.0 years). Mean weight was 78.6 kg (range 
52.0 to 127.2 kg), mean height was 173.1 cm (range 157.0 to 194.0 cm), and mean body mass index was 
26.0 (range 17.1 to 38.0 kg/m2). 
Subjects were well distributed by gender (7/15 [46.7%] male and 8/15 [53.3%] female). Most subjects 
(12/15, 80.0%) were white and the rest (3/15, 20.0%) were Asian. One (6.7%) subject was Hispanic or 
Latino. 
Medical history 
The most commonly reported medical history and surgery categories for the 15 subjects were 
hematopoietic/lymphatic (15, 100.0%); musculoskeletal (11, 73.3%); eyes, ears, nose & throat (8, 53.3%); 
genitourinary (8, 53.3%); and gastrointestinal (6, 40.0%). 
Median (min, max) lifetime exposure to coagulation concentrations was 20.0 (2, 400) days for the 15 
subjects. The most commonly used coagulation factor product was HAEMATE-P (10, 66.7%). 
The majority of subjects (10/15, 66.7%) were scheduled for major surgical procedures. Most subjects were 
to have open (4, 26.7%) or endoscopic (4, 26.7%) procedures; at musculoskeletal sites (7, 46.7%); at joint 
locations (1 [6.7%] ankle, 1 [6.7%] elbow, 1 [6.7%] hip, and 3 [20.0%] knee).

Numbers analysed 
The safety analysis set and the full analysis set were identical and consisted of all dosed patients. Thus, a 
total of 15 patients were included in these analysis sets. No patients were excluded from any analyses. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Outcome Measure – Overall Hemostatic Efficacy 
The primary outcome measure was the overall hemostatic efficacy of rVWF with or without Advate 24 hours 
after last perioperative infusion of IP or at Completion Visit Day 14 (whichever occurred first) using the 
hemostatic efficacy rating scale (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate”, or “none”).  
The overall haemostatic efficacy of Veyvondi treatment with or without rFVIII was assessed by the 
investigator (haemophilia physician) 24 hours after the last perioperative infusion or at completion of Day 14 
visits (whichever occurred earlier) using an ordinal 4-point rating scale. Of 15 treated patients, 10 
underwent major surgical procedures, 4 had minor and 1 oral procedure, and all of these were elective. A 
summary of surgical procedure types is given in the following. 
-  Major surgery (N=10): Total knee replacement, knee total endoprothesis, total hip replacement, 
complex dental extraction, molar extractions, anterior cruciate ligament surgery, laparoscopic 
cystectomy (2x), meniscectomy, prothesis left ankle 
-  Minor surgery (N=4): Nasopharyngoscopy/Laryngoscopy (2x), colonoscopy, radioisotope 
synovectomy 
-  Oral surgery (N=1): Tooth extraction 
Overall haemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent (11/15 subjects, 73.3%) or good (4/15 subjects, 26.7%) 
for all 15 treated subjects (Clopper-Pearson exact 90% CI: 81.9 to 100.0). If surgical procedure was 
classified as major, an excellent rating was achieved for 7/10 subjects (70%) and good rating for 3/10 
subjects (30.0). Noteworthy, details for the dental surgery procedures have been provided supporting 
classification as major surgery. The 4 minor surgical procedures achieved an excellent rating and the oral 
surgery was rated as good. Of VWD Type 3 patients, excellent ratings were achieved in 7/8 subjects. 
Secondary efficacy outcomes - Actual versus predicted blood loss (assessed by the operating 
surgeon) at completion of surgery 
Mean and median volumes of actual intraoperative blood loss were 94.3 ± 177.88 mL and 50.0 (0-700) mL, 
for predicted blood loss mean and median volume were 106.1 ± 161.82 mL and 50.0 (0-600) mL. For major 
surgical procedures, mean and median volumes of actual intraoperative blood loss were 127.0 ± 209.27 mL 
and 55.0 (5-700) mL, for predicted blood loss mean and median volume were 152.8 ± 186.33 mL and 50.0 
(10-600) mL. For minor surgical procedures, mean and median volumes of actual intraoperative blood loss 
were 0.0 ± 0.0 mL and 0.0 (0-0) mL, for predicted blood loss mean and median volumes were 2.5 ± 5.0 mL 
and 0.0 (0-0) mL. Actual blood loss of the one subject with oral surgery was 145.0 mL and predicted blood 
loss was 100.0 mL.  
The Applicant provided details depicting individual values of actual and predicted blood loss as shown below. 
The Applicant further noted that it is difficult to predict blood loss as it depends upon the nature of the 
surgical procedure, extent of incision(s) and subject to subject variability, among other variables and hence, 
blood loss could not be predefined in the protocol. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 79/113 
  
  
Regarding blood loss for subjects by VWD Type, mean volumes of actual and predicted blood loss were as 
follows: Type 1 - 115.0 mL and 100 mL; Type 2A - 42.5 mL and 10.0 mL, Type 2B - 50.0 mL and 50.0 mL, 
Type 2M - 50.0 mL and 50.0 mL,  and Type 3 - 110.6 mL and 134.4 mL. For Type 3 VWD, median volumes 
of actual and predicted blood loss were 12.5 (0-700) mL and 32.5 (0-600) mL. 
Secondary efficacy outcomes - Intraoperative haemostatic efficacy score on a scale of 
“excellent”, “good”, “moderate”, or “none” (assessed by the operating surgeon) at completion of 
surgery 
If intraoperative blood loss was ≤100% as expected for the type of procedure in a haemostatically normal 
subject it was rated excellent. A rating of good or moderate was achieved, if blood loss was 101-150% or 
≥150% to the maximum expected. Overall, ratings achieved were excellent (13/15 subjects, 86.7%) or 
good (2/15 subjects, 13.3%) for all 15 surgical procedures (Clopper-Pearson exact 90% CI: 81.9 to 100.0). 
For major surgical procedures, ratings of excellent (8/10 subjects, 80.0%) or good (2/10 subjects, 20.0%) 
were achieved for 10/10 subjects. Efficacy score was excellent for all 4 minor surgical procedures and one 
oral surgery. Haemostatic efficacy rating by VWD Type was as follows: Type 1 - excellent (N=3/3), Type 2A 
- good (N=1/2) and excellent (N=1/2), Type 2B - excellent (N=1), Type 2M - excellent (N=1), and Type 3 -

good (N=1/8) and excellent (N=7/8). One subject with Type 3 VWD required an intraoperative transfusion of 
packed red blood cells during a major total knee replacement surgery. 
Secondary efficacy outcomes - Daily intra- and post-operative weight-adjusted dose of rVWF with 
or without ADVATE through postoperative Day 14 
The median weight-adjusted postoperative daily doses for Veyvondi administered without rFVIII ranged 
between 42.3 IU/kg (Day 2) and 23.2 IU/kg (Day 6) in the first postoperative week and were lowest in the 
second week after surgery (16.3-29.3 IU/kg). Overall postoperative daily dose range (Day 1-14) for 
Veyvondi with or without rFVIII was 16.9 - 50.8 IU/kg for Veyvondi and 7.6 - 15.2 IU/kg for rFVIII. One 
subject was treated with Veyvondi and Advate intraoperatively (18.1 and 8.1 IU/kg, respectively). Of note, 2 
subjects experienced BEs during the study that were treated with Veyvondi (moderate menorrhagia, 
resolved in 47.0 hours after 6 infusions with a total dose of 142.7 IU/kg) and a licensed pdVWF/FVIII 
concentrate (minor joint bleed, resolved in 48.0 hours after 3,000 IU). A summary of median total doses of 
Veyvondi used with or without rFVIII for all subjects by treatment category is provided in the following table.

design). BEs were initially to be treated with an infusion of 
rVWF:rFVIII (ratio 1.3:1±0.2) and subsequently with rVWF with or 
without rFVIII, based on FVIII levels. Dosage was to be based on 
the subjects weight, type and severity of bleeding episode and 
based on clinical monitoring. Generally, initial dose target was 
VWF full replacement with VWF:RCo >0.6 IU/mL (60%) and 
FVIII:C >0.4 IU/mL (40%), however, in major BEs subsequent 
dose target was trough level of VWF:RCo of >50% for 3 days. On-
demand treatment of BEs was for a total duration of 12 months. 9 
subjects enrolled and randomised; 8 subjects treated with IP; 5 
subjects enrolled but discontinued study and 4 subjects completed 
study.

**One subject had 18 bleeding episodes and received IP treatment with 
unknown lot number. Therefore actual dose could not be calculated. For 
bleeding episode 1, one subject received a licensed pdVWF/FVIII 
concentrate for the third infusion due to logistical reasons. This bleeding is

Treatment 
Dose and dosage frequency were determined by type of 
surgery, PK results, and VWF and FVIII levels. Subjects 
received a priming dose of VEYVONDI (in general 40-60 
IU/kg VWF:RCo) preoperatively to raise endogenous 
FVIII levels to at least 30 IU/dL for minor/oral surgery 
or 60 IU/dL for major surgery. ADVATE was co-
administered if required FVIII levels were not achieved. 
VWF:RCo and FVIII:C target peak plasma levels for the 
calculation of the loading dose to be administered 
within 1 hour prior to surgery were 50-60 IU/dL and 40-
50 IU/dL for minor oral surgeries, respectively. For 
major surgeries, target levels were 100 IU/dL for 
VWF:RCo and 80-100 IU/dL for FVIII:C. Depending on 
VWF and FVIII levels subjects who had not achieved the 
desired post-infusion recovery continued to receive 
VEYVONDI with or without ADVATE for maintenance 
dosing. The peri- and postoperative substitution 
regimen was individualised according to the PK results, 
intensity and duration of the haemostatic challenge, 
and the institutions standard of care. Treatment 
duration was to extend from signing informed consent 
until a follow-up period of 14 days post-surgery. 24 
subjects were enrolled and screened, 15 subjects were 
treated with VEYVONDI.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Two Phase 3 studies were performed to evaluate efficacy of VEYVONDI in the on-demand treatment and 
during surgery in adult subjects with VWD. As study designs are different, a pooled analysis across the 
studies could not be made.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Phase 3 study 071001 followed a four-arm design to assess PK50 (co-administration of 50 IU/kg 
Veyvondi and rFVIII or Veyvondi and placebo in a crossover design), repeated PK80 (80 IU/kg Veyvondi), 
and on-demand treatment of BEs for a total of 12 months. Enrollment to study arms was guided by subjects’ 
preferences. Only 3 of the 4 arms did record treatment success and thus selection bias cannot be excluded. 
Measures to prevent bias were not foreseen. In general, however, the uncontrolled and non-randomised 
study design as chosen for efficacy assessment is considered appropriate to demonstrate clinical efficacy 
which is closely linked to VWF and FVIII blood levels and can directly be assessed by monitoring 
haemostasis, bleeding episodes, loss of blood or consumption of substituted product. The VWD population is 
adequately reflected and a sufficient number of adult subjects with severe VWD including patients with Type 
3 VWD completed the study. Study duration and endpoints chosen to evaluate efficacy of Veyvondi in the 
on-demand treatment of BEs, i.e. treatment success and consumption of Veyvondi with and without rFVIII 
and an observation period of at least 12 months, are considered appropriate. As per the SA given by CHMP, 
GI bleeds should not be excluded from the primary and secondary endpoints of study 071001. Analyses of 
primary and secondary study endpoints are provided for both, inclusion and exclusion of GI bleeds without 
showing differences of treatment success. The primary endpoint was changed within the ongoing study from 
Part A only to a combination of study parts A and B. The Applicant provided additional analyses based on 
Part A only, which confirmed the previous findings. For secondary endpoint evaluation a sub-analysis is 
provided showing Veyvondi consumption per BE in relation to the bleeding location. General methods to 
assess study endpoints including efficacy rating criteria are considered acceptable and typical for this product 
class. The participant flow and subjects included and excluded in/from the analysis sets and the general 
overview of the patient flow over the 3 submitted studies in VWD patients (070701, 071001, 071101) are 
considered adequate. The study was subjected to many changes within the ongoing study including a change 
in the primary endpoint (from Part A only to a combination of Part A and B) and there are always concerns 
that some of the changes could be data-driven. However, given the clear observed effect in the primary and 
key secondary endpoints, it is unlikely that these issues could have a qualitative impact on the primary 
efficacy analysis. 
For the Phase 3 surgery study (071101), the patient population and the uncontrolled, non-randomised 
design are considered acceptable. In accordance with the current EMA guideline for pdVWF products, 15 
surgical procedures of which 10 are considered as major were subjected for efficacy assessment including 
efficacy of haemostasis and loss of blood. All subjects received a priming and a loading dose of Veyvondi 
with or without rFVIII. This point was subject of concern in a previous CHMP protocol assistance scientific 
advice (19 July 2012, Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/1378/3/2012/PA/II, Question 5) and the total number of 
15 subjects with elective surgical procedures was regarded insufficient if prevention of surgical bleeding is 
investigated with either a priming dose of Veyvondi alone or a loading dose of Veyvondi and rFVIII. As 
priming and loading doses were administered subsequently for all 15 patients, the total number of evaluated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 88/113 
  
  
subjects is considered appropriate for the surgical study. The inclusion of 10 major surgical procedures is the 
minimum requirement as of the clinical guideline for pdVWF products and the Applicant defined criteria used 
to serve as guidance for major surgery generally referring to procedures such as major orthopedic, 
abdominal, gynecological, head and neck surgery, and extraction of third molars. In general, the total 
number of surgical procedures and the number of major surgical procedures are acceptable. Surgical 
procedures outlined as being major are largely consistent with definitions made in the study protocol. As 
procedures considered as major surgery appeared to be very heterogeneous, further details were provided 
about two dental related surgeries supporting classification as major surgery. Furthermore, it is 
acknowledged that predefinition of blood loss is difficult due to the amount of underlying variables. 
Individual values depicting the predicted and actual blood loss of each procedure have been provided. Taken 
methodological difficulties into account, the data appear to be consistent and sufficient to support the 
efficacy of Veyvondi. Noteworthy, blood loss was not predicted in one case with knee total endoprothesis. 
Actual blood loss for this procedure was 80 mL supporting the conclusion of sufficient haemostatic efficacy of 
Veyvondi in major and minor surgery, taken the limited number of surgical procedures into account. 
Study endpoints, duration and methods are considered sufficient to assess haemostatic efficacy and loss of 
blood. The general conduct of the study is considered acceptable, the participant flow and subjects included 
and excluded in/from the analysis sets are sufficiently described. 
Overall, the design and conduct of studies 071001 and 071101 are in line with the current EMA guideline for 
pdVWF products, are consistent with GCP, and are considered acceptable taking methodical flaws and 
uncertainties into account. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 071001: Efficacy of Veyvondi in the on-demand treatment of BEs in severe VWD patients was 
evaluated in study 071001 using dosing strategies aligned with bleeding severity, VWD Type and subjects’ 
weight. The majority of BEs (n=166) was treated using a combination of Veyvondi and rFVIII with median 
doses of 46.5 IU/kg and 33.6 IU/kg, respectively. Doses of Veyvondi were similar, i.e. 52.8 IU/kg, when 
administered alone for the smaller number of BEs (n=30) and generally in accordance with the guideline on 
the core SPC for human pdVWF (CPMP/BPWG/278/02). 
Haemostatic efficacy, expressed as the number of subjects with a treatment success for treated BEs 
prospectively assessed and including gastrointestinal bleeds (N=20 subjects) has been demonstrated, i.e. 
was 95% (Clopper-Pearson exact 95% CI: 75.1 to 99.9). Secondary endpoint analysis showed that the 
proportion of Veyvondi-treated BEs (including GI bleeds) with an ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ efficacy rating was 
97.7% (127/130, Clopper-Pearson exact 95% CI: 93.4 to 99.5). Haemostatic efficacy was rated excellent in 
184/192 (95.8%), good in 4/192 (2.1%) moderate in 3/192 (1.6%) and none in 1/192 (0.5%) BEs. These 
results are based on an updated analysis where 3 major mucosal bleeds were re-classified as moderate 
instead of excellent and good to align the efficacy rating with the criteria laid down in the protocol. 
Furthermore, for sensitivity analysis one bleeding event was re-classified as treatment failure as the infusion 
had to be stopped due to an AE. This sensitivity analysis resulted in an estimate for the success rate of 
90.9% (95% CI was 70.8 to 98.9, N=20/22). 
Additional case details were provided on these four bleeding events. From these data it can be seen that 3 of 
the patients received an additional prophylactic infusion on the day after resolution of their major mucosal 
bleeding event. From a clinical perspective it is understood that patients receive a prophylactic infusion after 
resolution of a bleeding episode to prevent a re-bleed. However, it is not considered acceptable to consider 
this additional infusion on the day after bleeding resolution as independent prophylactic infusion as it is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 89/113 
  
  
directly related to the preceding bleeding event. Moreover, definitions for efficacy rating as laid down in the 
protocol should be followed 
Further analyses have been conducted with regards to bleeding severity and bleeding location including GI 
bleedings. It is considered that subgroup analyses as provided are reasonable and reflect current use of VWF 
as outlined in the guideline on the core Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for human pdVWF. With 
regards to efficacy assessment, several issues had been identified that were related e.g. to home treatment, 
the use of concomitant medication and retrospective efficacy assessment.  
A linear dose-response relationship could not be established with statistical significance in the Phase 1 PK 
study (070701) using AUC and IR for VWF:RCo in dose Cohorts 2, 3 and 4. However, provided data suggest 
a linear dose-response relationship for Veyvondi as determined by AUC0-∞ after single doses of 7.5, 20 and 
50 IU/kg and a pronounced difference between the higher Veyvondi dose groups (Cohort 3: 20 IU/kg and 
Cohort 4: 50 IU/kg VWF:Co) was found, i.e. means of AUC0-inf and Cmax were 590.82 h*U/dL (SD: 180.87) 
and 30.75 U/dL (SD: 6.65), respectively, for the lower dose cohort and 1541.45 h*U/dL (SD: 554.31) and 
76.45 U/dL (SD: 21.09) for the higher dose cohort. 
Overall, results from study 071001 demonstrate haemostatic efficacy thus supporting therapeutic indications 
as outlined in the SmPC. The initially claimed indication to include prevention of bleeding episodes could not 
be granted because no studies or data have been provided supporting the claim for prophylaxis. Initially, the 
indication included patients generally diagnosed with VWD and did not restrict treatment to patients 
diagnosed with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contra-indicated. As no 
data or studies have been provided to support this claim, the indication was not accepted and the indication 
was revised in accordance with the EMA recommendation and the guideline on the core SPC for human 
pdVWF (CPMP/BPWG/278/02).  
The indication as outlined in the SmPC for VWD patients when desmopressin treatment alone is ineffective or 
not indicated is considered acceptable. It was considered not acceptable to add “and control” in the 
indication “treatment and control of haemorrhage” as no rationale and supportive evidence was provided. 
The indication as currently outlined is in accordance with the VWF Core SPC guideline and supported by the 
submitted data and thus considered acceptable. 
Study 071101: Haemostatic efficacy of Veyvondi administered with or without rFVIII was evaluated in 15 
subjects with severe VWD undergoing elective surgery including 10 major surgical procedures as outlined 
above. Clinical efficacy of 100% (90% CI: 81.9 to 100.0) was demonstrated and expressed as haemostatic 
efficacy 24 hours after the last perioperative Veyvondi infusion or at completion of Day 14 visit. For 
secondary study outcome, intraoperative actual versus predicted blood loss was assessed by the operating 
surgeon at completion of surgery. Based on these data, intraoperative haemostatic efficacy was rated 
showing that 100% (90% CI: 81.9 to 100.0) of the surgical procedures achieved a rating of good or 
excellent, i.e. intraoperative blood loss was 101-150% or ≤100% as expected for the type of procedure in a 
haemostatically normal subject. Furthermore, peri-operative weight-adjusted consumption of Veyvondi with 
or without rFVIII was evaluated. Treatment regimen used to demonstrate efficacy, i.e. start of treatment 12-
24 hours before surgery which was to be repeated 1 hour before the procedure and subsequent infusions 
over one to several days, and administered doses of Veyvondi are in accordance with the current EMA 
guideline on the core SmPC for pdVWF. Overall, efficacy as demonstrated in surgery is considered sufficient 
Assessment report

to support the therapeutic indication as outlined in the SmPC and data are based on an appropriate number 
of minor and major surgical procedures. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, efficacy analyses are based on an appropriate number of VWD patients including subjects with 
severe and Type 3 VWD and study design and analyses are, to the larger extent, in accordance with the 
current EMA guideline on the clinical investigation of pdVWF products and in accordance with GCP, taking 
statistical drawbacks and issues related to study conduct, in particular with reference to study 071001, into 
account. Sufficient haemostatic efficacy for Veyvondi has been demonstrated in the on-demand treatment of 
BEs as well as for perioperative treatment during elective minor and major surgical procedures. Overall, the 
provided data are considered acceptable to support marketing authorisation of Veyvondi.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety of recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF; vonicog alfa, BAX 111) has been evaluated in the 
following four completed clinical studies: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Phase 1 Study 070701: investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of rVWF 
administered with rFVIII (ADVATE) in subjects with severe von Willebrand Disease (VWD)  
Phase 3 Study 071001: investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of rVWF with or 
without rFVIII (ADVATE) in the treatment of bleeding episodes in subjects with VWD  
Phase 3 Study 071101: investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of rVWF with or 
without rFVIII (ADVATE) in subjects with severe VWD undergoing major or minor elective surgical 
procedures 
Phase 1 Study 071104: investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of rVWF in 
combination with rFVIII (ADVATE) in subjects with severe hemophilia A. 
An integrated safety analysis was provided based on 80 unique subjects from studies 070701, 071001 and 
071101. Safety data derived from study 071104 in haemophilia A patients were supportive only.  
The safety evaluations used in the clinical studies are derived from recommendations for coagulation factor 
concentrates by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis and the EMA Guideline on the 
Clinical Investigation of Human Plasma Derived Von Willebrand Factor Products. Safety was assessed in 
terms of immunogenicity, thrombogenicity and adverse events (AEs) including the following evaluations: 
•  Neutralising and total binding antibodies to von Willebrand factor (VWF) 
•  Neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (FVIII) 
•  Antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) proteins, murine immunoglobulin G (IgG) or rFurin 
•  Coagulation assessments 
•  Signs of thrombosis or thromboembolic complications (clinical signs and measurement of thrombotic 
markers) 
•  Other IP related AEs, such as clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters 
(hematology and clinical chemistry, urinalysis), coagulation assessments and vital signs 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018

•  Viral serology (HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV 1/2, B19V) 
•  Cardiac troponin (assessed only in Study 070701) 
The safety data of all four studies were assessed periodically by an independent data monitoring committee 
(DMC).

aOne subject was re-enrolled and counted twice. bOne subject received pdVWF instead of rVWF, which is not IP according to the ISS 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Therefore, this subject was not included in the ISS SAS, however was included in the SAS of the clinical 
study report. As a result, the study report states that 19 subjects (instead of 20 in the ISS) were not exposed to rVWF:rFVIII or rVWF, and 
that 32 subjects were included in the SAS. cTwo subjects were treated with IP in both 070701 and 071001 studies. One subject was treated 
with IP in both 071001 and 071101 studies. AE reports from those subjects during both studies are included in the integrated 
analysis. dSubjects who participated in more than one Cohort are displayed only once. e23 subjects also received a single intravenous dose 
of pdVWF.  
Adverse events 
Within the dossier, an overall summary of the 187 AEs reported in 49/80 unique subjects from the 
integrated safety analysis comprising subjects of first PK Phase 1 study (070701), PK and BEs treatment 
Phase 3 study (071001) and Phase 3 surgery study (071101) has been presented as shown in the following. 
Table 17: AEs from an integrated safety analysis of 80 unique subjects (studies 070701, 071001 
and 071101) 
AEs as categorised by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class (SOC) 
that occurred with a frequency of  n≥3 during or after VEYVONDI infusion or in N≥3 subjects were as 
follows: Iron deficiency anaemia (n=5, N=4), vertigo (n=3, N=2), nausea (n=3, N=3), vomiting (n=4,

than 30% (53/187) of the overall number of AEs in the pooled safety analysis. A temporal association

occurring in >2% of the subjects was found for headache, dizziness, infusion site extravasation, generalised 
pruritus, vertigo and vomiting. The overall AE profile was considered to by typical for VWD patients. In terms 
of AE frequency, it must be noted that frequency of each reported AE is >1% due to the size of safety 
population (N=80). The most common AE observed in 10% of the subjects was headache, considered to be 
expected for infusion of blood coagulation factors. No unexpected gender-specific differences in the 
occurrence of AEs were observed during clinical development. AE for which a causal relationship to Veyvondi 
exposure has been established are shown in the following. 
Table 18: Causally related AEs that occurred during or after VEYVONDI infusion listed by MedDRA 
SOC (integrated SAS) 
Of related AEs, only generalised pruritus occurred in more than one subject. For 2 of the related AEs listed 
above, i.e. platelet disorder and psychomotor hyperactivity, the sponsor found no plausible relationship to 
Veyvondi treatment and concluded these to be unrelated. Platelet disorder was expressed as an increase of 
sP-selectin, a cell adhesion molecule of endothelial cells and activated platelets, in a white male subject of 
Cohort 4A of PK study 070701, 47 years of age, 88.2 kg bodyweight, and 174.0 cm height. Platelet count in 
this subject was normal during the observation period. Psychomotoric hyperactivity was experienced in one 
subject in 2 episodes of which one was considered to be related and the other as unrelated by the 
investigator. The subject had a medical history of chronic anxiety and insomnia considered to be more likely 
causative for the AE.  
In study 070701, 8 related AEs as assessed by the investigator occurred in 4 unique subjects within the 
initial 72 hour time period post-infusion and were mild: Hypertension (n=2, N=1, 1x in Cohort 1 and 1x in 
Cohort 4A), tremor (n=1, Cohort 2), generalised pruritus (n=1, Cohort 2), nausea (n=1, Cohort 4A), platelet 
disorder/variable sP-selectin values (n=1, Cohort 4A), dizziness (n=1, Cohort 4A), psychomotor 
hyperactivity (n=1, Cohort 4A). Of these, platelet disorder and psychomotoric hyperactivity have been 
assessed as not treatment related by the sponsor. The event of tremor, i.e. tremors to feet, was mild in 
severity and recovered within 24 hours. Dizziness was of mild severity and resolved <24 hours.

In study 071001, 8 AEs were considered as related. 6/8 related, non-serious AEs occurred in 4 subjects, i.e. 
tachycardia, infusion site paraesthesia, ECG T-wave inversion, dysgeusia, generalised pruritus, and hot 
flush. The ECG abnormality was reported in a 56 year old Asian female 0.7 hours after the second PK 
infusion in study 071001. The subject did not show any clinical symptoms, haematological and clinical 
chemistry parameters were in the normal range and the event resolved within <24 hours without requiring 
treatment. The subject’s medical history included ongoing treatment with Carteolol Hydrochloride, a 
nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent used for ophthalmic (glaucoma) treatment. Because there is 
insufficient information to assess whether Carteolol had an impact on the reported ECG finding, the T-wave 
inversion was assessed as AE with possible relation to Veyvondi treatment. 2 related serious AEs (SAEs) 
occurred in 1 subject, i.e. chest discomfort and increased heart rate. No thrombotic event, neutralising 
antibodies to VWF or FVIII, or binding antibodies against CHO protein or murine IgG or rFurin were detected 
in this study. One subject experienced dysgeusia, which was of moderate severity and resolved <24hours. 
The same subject experienced tachycardia of moderate severity and infusion site paraesthesia of mild 
severity, both AEs recovered within 24 hours. 
In study 071101, no AEs were assessed as related. One subject (43 year old, female) experienced 2 
thrombotic AEs (non-serious deep vein thrombosis 4 days after the surgery followed by serious deep vein 
thrombosis 8 days after surgery). The subject was hospitalised for total hip replacement surgery, received 
Veyvondi and rFVIII treatment (baseline for PK assessment, loading dose of rFVIII, last infusion of Veyvondi 
on Day 7 after surgery) and dabigatran for thrombosis prevention which was later switched to enoxaparin. 3 
days after surgery, a non-occlusive thrombosis of the left common and deep femoral veins, which did not 
meet the criteria for a SAE, was diagnosed. The event was considered life-threatening 7 days after surgery 
because a floating thrombus of left common femoral vein was reported. The investigator judged these 
thrombotic AEs as unlikely related to rVWF, not related to Advate, and not related to study procedures. The 
patient’s ADAMTS13 level was below the normal range (37%; normal range 50 to 160%). Laboratory data 
and assessment of thrombophilic polymorphism did not show abnormalities. A caval filter was placed on the 
same day and the event was considered resolved when the subject was rehospitalised for removal of the 
vena cava filter 2 months later. The event was rated with moderate severity, unlikely related to Veyvondi 
treatment and probably related to orthopaedic surgery. One subject was post-operatively tested positive for 
binding antibodies to VWF. No neutralising antibodies to FVIII or binding antibodies against CHO protein, 
murine IgG or rFurin occurred in this study. 
In study 071104, no AEs were assessed as related. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths in studies 070701, 071001, 071101 or 071104. A total of 12 non-fatal SAEs occurred 
in 10 patients during or after exposure to Veyvondi administered with or without rFVIII. The overall SAE 
frequency by subject was thus 12.5% (10/80) and by infusion 2.1% (10/476). All subjects recovered from 
the respective SAE. No SAEs occurred after infusion of Veyvondi with or without rFVIII during study 071104.

Page 96/113 
  
  
Table 19: Summary of SAEs in VWD patients of studies 070701, 071001, 071101 
Two out of the 12 non-fatal SAEs, i.e. chest discomfort and increased heart rate, occurred simultaneously in 
one subject and were considered possibly related to Veyvondi treatment. Subject 510001 was a Caucasian 
male subject born in 1976 and allocated to the PK50 + on-demand-treatment of BEs Arm of study 071001. 
The patient received two times Veyvondi for PK assessment and was administered Veyvondi with and 
without rFVIII for the treatment of left ankle bleeds two times before the event. On the third scheduled date 
for administration of Veyvondi and rFVIII again for the treatment of left ankle bleed, the subjects heart rate 
increased by 8 beats per minute (from 86 to 94) and the blood pressure increased from 116/78 to 146/96 
mmHg, infusion was interrupted after 3 minutes. The subject was treated with O2 (2L/min) according to the 
local standard of care, symptoms improved within 10 min and fully recovered within 3 hours. Further 
diagnostics showed a sinus arrhythmia but otherwise regular ECG, a mild hypokalaemia of 3.3 mmol/L and 
normal 12 hours troponin levels. After overnight observation the subject was discharged from hospital the 
next day with normal potassium and without sequelae. The causal relationship was considered probably 
related by the investigator, and possibly related by the pharmacovigilance/ company. Two years later, the 
event term was amended to “transfusion reaction”. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinically significant laboratory results of haematology and chemistry parameters were not pooled and were 
presented individually by study. Some inter-subject discrepancies were observed in the investigators’ rating 
of clinical significance of abnormal parameters at baseline and post-treatment due to pre-existing conditions. 
However, overall no clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters were considered related to rVWF. 
Study 070701: Evidence of ADAMTS13 mediated multimer proteolysis of Veyvondi was observed for most 
subjects. One subject did not show proteolysis after infusion of Veyvondi, however, the subject had an 
existing non-neutralising binding antibody to VWF and PK parameters were similar to other subjects. No 
Assessment report

changes of blood platelet count related to Veyvondi infusion and sufficient to indicate thrombocytopenia have 
been observed. There were no significant deviations from the patients’ haemoglobin baseline levels and no 
evidence of haemolysis after Veyvondi infusion. With regards to serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), it is noteworthy that majority 
of subjects had pre-existing hepatitis and serum LDH, AST and ALT levels fluctuated between the upper part 
of the normal range to slightly above the normal range as a result. 5 subjects showed borderline elevation of 
LDH levels post-infusion. Three subjects had substantial elevations of LDH (up to 690 U/L) and AST levels 
(up to 92 U/L). The LDH elevations were mostly attributed to haemolysis/incorrect storage whereas most 
AST or ALT elevations were attributed to pre-existing disease including viral hepatitis. No subject had an 
LDH increase of twice the upper limit of normal. Elevated levels of sP-selectin post infusion of rVWF were 
initially reported in one subject as related AE. Given the consistent platelet count of the patient and medical 
condition, an association was considered to be unlikely. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels did not 
indicate any evidence of renal failure. Glucose level was elevated in one subject with a history of 
hypertension, allergies and smoking. There were no post-treatment changes from normal to abnormal for 
any coagulation parameter assessed to be clinically significant by the investigators. 
Study 071001: Clinically significant abnormal results for haematology parameters including haemoglobin, 
haematocrit, erythrocytes, leucocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume and 
erythrocyte mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were observed in 11 subjects. None were 
considered as AE and all were expected due to the underlying bleeding diseases. Clinically significant 
abnormal values for AST and ALT were observed for 3 subjects throughout most of the study period. None 
were considered as AE but due to a pre-existing disease. Abnormal high values of bilirubin have been 
observed in one subject at screening until study end which was attributed due to a positive anti-HCV test 
result at screening. Up to 23 subjects had clinically significant abnormally high activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT), most probably related to the underlying bleeding disease. Clinically significant 
increased values for ADMATS13 levels were observed in two subjects, no subject had abnormally low levels 
of ADAMTS13. D-dimers as assessed in routine tests were normal for all subjects, however, high D-dimer 
levels prior to exposure in an additional planned test for home treatment qualification occurred in one 
subject. No significant findings with respect to sP-selectin values were observed during the study. 
Study 071101: Clinically significant abnormal results were observed for haematological parameters in 7 
subjects but no notable trends were observed after treatment with Veyvondi. However, one subject 
experienced a moderate AE of iron deficiency anemia which was considered not related to study procedure 
or treatment. Clinically significant abnormal results were also observed for ALT, blood urea nitrogen, 
chloride, and protein in one subject but none were considered as AE. Relevant changes of coagulation 
parameters after treatment with Veyvondi were observed in 10 subjects (mostly high aPTT and low 
VWF:RCo) and attributed to the underlying disease. None of these were considered as AE. Urinalysis showed 
that one subject was positive for nitrite on postoperative Day 7 and 4 subjects were positive for occult blood 
at completion/termination, all considered unrelated to Veyvondi exposure. 
Study 071104: In terms of haematological parameters, two subjects had clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory values (erythrocytes, platelets, erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume), none of these were 
considered as AE. Three subjects had clinically significant abnormal clinical chemistry parameters including 
increased levels of AST, ALT, bilirubin and LDH, but none was linked to Veyvondi treatment or was reported 
as AE. As reported from urinalysis, one subject had clinically significant abnormal values (protein, blood) due 
to a history of liver disease (HCV) and unrelated to Veyvondi exposure. No laboratory results were indicative 
for renal failure.

Viral safety: The viral safety of Veyvondi was established by the combined contributions of the following: Use 
of well characterised cell line (from Advate manufacturing process), non-utilisation of human and animal 
proteins in the cell culture process, and testing of the fermenter harvest. Seroconversion of blood-borne 
viruses including HIV, HAV, HBV, HCV and parvovirus B19 was also investigated (studies 070701 and 
071001, in the surgery study viral markers were assessed only pre-infusion). During the clinical 
development program, none of the subjects had confirmed seroconversion related to Veyvondi treatment for 
any of these blood-borne viruses. In study 070701, one subject had positive antibody titers for HCV after 
exposure to Veyvondi which was determined due to a lab error. No seroconversion of viral markers was 
observed in study 071001. Viral markers were also assessed in study 071101, but only before exposure to 
Veyvondi. In study 071104, no seroconversion of viral markers was observed although a shift of a negative 
versus a positive titer for HBV core antibody and parvovirus B19 in two subjects was reported. It was 
concluded that these were not indicative for seroconversion and not related to study drug. The subject with 
HBV core antibodies had a HBV vaccination in 2002. At screening, this subject had a positive titer for 
hepatitis B surface antibody but a negative one for HBV core antibody. The other subject had a titer for 
parvovirus B19 IgG of 0.48 at screening and 1.58 at end of study. The slightly elevated titer was assessed as 
positive but the increase was considered too low to indicate seroconversion. 
Effect of excipients and impurities: It is known that polysorbate 80 (e.g. Tween 80) can be causative for 
hypersensitivity reactions possibly as the result of complement activation. Polysorbate is part of formulations 
of Veyvondi as well as of rFVIII and the administration of 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg together with 62 IU Advate/kg 
corresponds to 0.14 mg/kg polysorbate 80 exposure. This is substantially below the maximum recommended 
dose (~1-3 mg/kg) and below the concentrations that were shown to activate the human complement 
system in vitro. In patients with known hypersensitivity to this substance the use of polysorbate 80 should 
be generally avoided.  
Immunological events 
Potential immunogenicity of Veyvondi was assessed by monitoring neutralising antibodies against rVWF and 
rFVIII, as well as binding antibodies against VWF, rFurin, CHO proteins and murine IgG. 
Inhibitory antibodies to FVIII were assessed by the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay and testing 
was considered positive if titers were ≥0.4 Bethesda Units (BU), for the regular Bethesda assay the 
threshold was ≥0.6 BU. One BU is thereby defined as the amount of inhibitor that decreases the measured 
activity in the assays to 50% of that of the negative control sample. The FVIII inhibitor assay was performed 
on the coagulation analyser CA 7000. Validation data are provided including evaluation of intermediate 
precision, accuracy, and specificity.  
Inhibitory antibodies to VWF were defined by their ability to interfere with one or more of the biological 
activities of VWF, i.e. VWF:RCo, VWF:CB or FVIII binding. VWF:CB activity and VWF:FVIII binding capacity 
were measured by ELISA and VWF:RCo activity was measured using an automated ristocetin cofactor assay. 
Quantification of VWF inhibitory antibodies was based on the principle of the Bethesda assay established for 
the quantitative analysis of inhibitors against FVIII. The amount of inhibitor was expressed likewise as BU 
(defined as described above) per mL. For assay validation, samples from two Type 3 VWD patients with 
known alloantibodies (low titer sample: 1-2 BU/mL, high titer sample: ~10 BU/mL) and plasma samples 
from immunised non-human primates were used. Validation data are provided including evaluation of lower 
limit of quantification, intermediate precision and repeatability, and assay robustness. 
Assessment report

Binding antibodies (IgM, IgA and IgG isotypes) directed against VWF were quantified by means of an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employing polyclonal anti-human IgG antibodies and an 
increase of ≥3 titration steps was considered positive. Testing was performed in Baxter laboratory and 
validation data have been provided including assessments of assay precision, robustness, specificity, and 
linearity/dynamic range. Assaying for the presence of antibodies against CHO protein (IgG isotype), rFurin 
(IgG isotype) and murine IgG was conducted using proprietary immunoassays. Anti-CHO and anti-rFurin 
antibody assays were performed in Baxter laboratory. Validation data referring to precision, specificity, and 
linearity/dynamic range are provided. Testing for Human Anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) was performed 
using a CE-marked ELISA kit to quantify HAMA originating from human serum samples. A validation report 
addressing assay precision, specificity, and linearity/dynamic range has been provided 
Neutralising antibodies against VWF and anti-FVIII: No neutralising antibodies directed against VWF or FVIII 
have been found in subjects from studies 070701, 071001, or 071101. The repeated PK assessment 
conducted in study 071001 supports these findings as parameters of both PK assessments were comparable. 
In study 071104, none of the haemophilia A patients developed neutralising antibodies against FVIII or VWF 
after exposure to Veyvondi and rFVIII. One subject in this study had positive anti-FVIII inhibitor titer prior to 
treatment and was withdrawn prior to the third PK treatment. 
Binding antibodies against VWF: In study 070701, two out of 31 subjects had a high titer (1:1280) for 
binding antibodies against VWF at screening prior to first exposure to Veyvondi. Medical conditions of these 
subjects including therapeutic requirements for BE treatment or new disorders have not been observed. No 
treatment-related increase in antibody titers was observed in this study. In the surgery study (071101), one 
subject with Type 3 VWD developed anti-VWF binding antibodies (1:80) 7 days after the surgical procedure. 
The titer remained positive until study completion, no AEs were reported for this subject. No positive results 
for binding antibodies against VWF were found in all 37 evaluated subjects exposed to Veyvondi in study 
071001 and in 12 haemophilia A patients of study 071104. 
Binding antibodies against impurities: No subject of studies 070701, 071001, 071101 and 071104 developed 
or had an increase of binding antibodies directed against CHO cell protein, rFurin or murine IgG. 
Safety in special populations 
Studies involving paediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been conducted and only one 
geriatric patient was treated in the clinical development program. Due to the small subject number for 
Veyvondi no formal population subgroup analyses for demographic factors including age, sex and race were 
conducted.  
No safety issues have risen from study 071104 (Phase 1 in haemophilia A patients) as no SAE were 
reported. In this study, four AEs occurred in 3/12 treated subjects, i.e. laceration, epistaxis, hypotension, 
and mouth haemorrhage/tooth bleed. None was assessed as treatment-related.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Not applicable. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Phase 1 PK study (070701), none of the subjects discontinued formally due to an AE, however, one 
subject who had two related AEs (nausea and variable soluble p-selectin values), withdrew from the study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 100/113 
  
  
on the day of the second infusion. The reason for subject withdrawal has not been detailed. In study 071001 
the subject experiencing chest discomfort was withdrawn. Additionally, one subject became pregnant during 
the study course and withdrew consent. In the surgery study (071101), none of the subjects discontinued 
due to an AE. In the Phase 1 study in haemophilia A patients (071104), no subject withdrew due to an AE 
occurring after infusion, however, one subject was positive for FVIII inhibitor prior to study treatment but 
still received infusions of rFVIII without and with Veyvondi. The subject was withdrawn before the third 
treatment because of violation of an exclusion criterion; antibody titer remained unchanged as assessed 
after the first infusion (rFVIII) and at study end (after rFVIII and Veyvondi). 
Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing data have been provided. Veyvondi was granted marketing authorisation in the US on 08 
December 2015 and launched in August 2016. As of 07 March 2017, two AEs were reported in two subjects: 
Nausea (non-serious) and deep vein thrombosis (serious). One female subject aged 70 years experienced 
nausea which was non-serious and a listed AE, i.e. expected. One 71-year old male subject experienced 
deep vein thrombosis. Due to lacking information about medical history and event details, relatedness could 
not be assessed initially but the unexpected event was considered serious and related by the applicant. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The safety profile of Veyvondi was evaluated in all four completed clinical trials. The SAS is based on 80 
unique subjects with VWD from studies 070701, 071001 and 071101 and supportive safety data from study 
071104 in patients with haemophilia A. 
Safety of Veyvondi was assessed by occurrence of AEs, development of neutralising antibodies to VWF and 
FVIII, binding antibodies to VWF, Furin, CHO proteins and murine IgG, viral safety, haematology, clinical 
chemistry and vital signs. 29 VWD subjects were exposed to Veyvondi for treatment of BEs for a total 
duration of 12 months (Arms 1, 3 and 4 of study 071001) and 15 patients were exposed during elective 
minor and major surgical procedures. Other subjects, i.e. 31 subjects from study 070701 and 8 subjects 
from Arm 2 of study 071001, received single or repeated PK infusion only. Mean doses of Veyvondi used for 
the treatment of BEs, i.e. 48.6 IU/kg (when administered with Advate) and 64.1 IU/kg (when administered 
alone) are within an expected dose range of a VWF product. Dose-exposure-response relationship has been 
characterised in the PK and efficacy assessments showing sufficient and sustained levels of VWF:RCo after 
Veyvondi infusion, a substantial effect on FVIII levels and demonstrating efficacy in the treatment of BEs and 
during elective surgical procedures. 
Initially, 16 AEs were assessed as related by the investigator of which 14 AE were assessed as related by the 
sponsor including 2 SAEs. Most of the reported AEs were expected AEs and in accordance with the core SPC 
guideline such as flush, nausea, tachycardia, infusion site paresthesia, chest discomfort/tightness and 
generalised pruritus/urticaria which can be attributed to infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. The two 
related AEs, assessed as related by the investigator but not-related by the sponsor, were detailed as 
increased sP-selectin expressed as platelet disorder and psychomotoric hyperactivity. As no deviation of 
platelet levels count occurred and the subject with psychomotoric hyperactivity had a history of chronic 
anxiety, insomnia and another event of psychomotoric hyperactivity which was assessed as unrelated, it is 
acceptable that these AEs are not considered to be treatment related. The two SAE initially assessed as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 101/113 
  
  
 
related to Veyvondi, i.e. chest discomfort and increased heart rate, resolved without sequelae and were 
expected for the treatment of VWF according to the core SPC guideline. Regarding treatment-related AEs 
localised to the nervous system, dizziness (mild, resolved <24 hours), dysgeusia (moderate, resolved <24 
hours) and tremor (mild, resolved <24 hours) were reported. These AEs were of mild or moderate severity 
and recovered within 24 hours. No data are available to postulate or discuss potential pathomechanisms and 
due to the small number of subjects it cannot be assessed whether these effects are specific for Veyvondi 
treatment. Dizziness, dysgeusia and tremor are not listed in the current VWF core SPC guideline, however, 
at least dizziness and dysgeusia have been reported as AEs for the drug class of blood coagulation factors. 
The AE of tremor appeared to be suspect and a detailed case narrative of this subject was provided. 
According to this, it appears more likely that tremor was related to the patients pre-existing medical 
condition including chronic use of benzodiazepines. There have also been some concerns regarding the 
evaluation of relationship for some of the temporally-associated adverse events. It was unclear why vertigo 
and vomiting were considered not related to IP. Considering that the possibility of a causal relationship 
between the events of vertigo and vomiting could not be ruled out based on the nature of the events and 
their close temporal proximity to the last infusion of the study drug, section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated 
accordingly. 
Another AE of particular importance was the ECG abnormality, i.e. T-wave inversion. The subject did not 
show clinical symptoms, no treatment was required and the event resolved within 24 hours. Although the 
subject was treated with a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent used for ophthalmic disease, a 
possible relation could not be ruled out. However, as rVWF is a large protein an impact on the cardiac 
impulse formation or conduction system is unlikely.  
Overall, a sufficient number of subjects have been exposed to Veyvondi, i.e. for the treatment of BEs with a 
total duration of 12 months, during surgical procedures and for PK assessments, to adequately evaluate the 
safety profile. Assessment of AEs including SAEs in subjects exposed to Veyvondi is acceptable and most of 
the AEs are expected for coagulation factor treatment.  
Thrombogenicity is a potential risk of Veyvondi treatment. 2 thrombotic events have been reported in one 
subject from the surgery study and data were provided supporting the assumption that these events were 
more likely related to the underlying disease and medical history of the subject (i.e. surgery for total hip 
replacement). However, the presence of several risk factors does not preclude a causal relationship and it 
was considered necessary to add this AE to the tabulated list of ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC. It must be 
further noted, that data from post-marketing experience obtained in the US showed another thrombotic AE, 
i.e. a deep vein thrombosis in a geriatric patient. No further data were available to assess relatedness and 
event details and the case was considered serious and related to Vonvendi treatment by the applicant. 
Noteworthy, and with regards to non-clinical analyses of thrombogenicity, the potential thrombogenicity of 
rVWF alone and in combination with rFVIII was previously investigated in a rabbit stasis model (nonclinical 
study PV2010701). This test was based on thrombus formation in a ligated vein segment after intravenous 
infusion of the test or reference items, i.e. a licensed pdVWF/FVIII concentrate was used as an active 
control. No signs of thrombogenicity were detected at the tested dose levels for rVWF alone, rVWF 
administered with Advate or the reference items. In summary, administration of rVWF up to a dose of 1262 
IU VWF:RCo/kg BW alone or with Advate up to a dose of 812.5 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW + 623.7 IU rFVIII/kg BW 
gave no indication of possible thrombogenicity in the rabbit stasis model. With regards to the assessment 
thrombogenicity, reference has to be made to the current literature. In general, patients with inherited 
bleeding disorders occasionally develop venous thromboembolism (VTE) and most venous events in this 
population occur in the presence of an additional risk factor for VTE, such as the postoperative setting or 
during clotting factor replacement. Spontaneous VTE is considered as rare in patients with VWD, however, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 102/113 
  
  
cases frequently had identifiable risk factors and the most common risk factor was factor replacement 
therapy consisting of VWF with FVIII  [see: Martin, Karlyn, and Nigel S. Key. "How I treat patients with 
inherited bleeding disorders who need anticoagulant therapy." Blood 128.2 (2016): 178-184; and references 
made within]. As from another reference, it was reported that the overall prevalence for thrombotic AEs in 
patients suffering from haemophilia or VWD is 3.6 per 103 patients (3.6 per 105 for severe AEs) and 1.13 per 
106 infusions, with higher figures in VWD than in haemophilia [Coppola, A., et al. "Thrombotic adverse 
events to coagulation factor concentrates for treatment of patients with haemophilia and von Willebrand 
disease: a systematic review of prospective studies." Haemophilia 18.3 (2012)].  
In summary, there were 2 patients experiencing thrombotic AEs that were assessed as serious and related 
to Veyvondi treatment by the applicant. One case occurred in the surgery study and was associated with 
additional risk factors (obesity, low ADAMTS13 level, and the surgical procedure itself, i.e. total hip 
replacement) and the other case occurred during the US post-marketing phase with currently unknown 
history (no case narrative available). Hence, these 2 case are described in the SmPC as frequency of 
thrombotic AEs associated with Veyvondi treatment cannot currently been properly estimated based on the 
available low number of patients. Adequate reference to both cases of DVT are provided in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. 
With regards to viral safety, a substantial number of subjects had titers for viral hepatitis. One subject in 
study 070701 showed positive HCV antibody titers after infusion with Veyvondi which were attributed to a 
lab error. In study 071104 one subject had a shift to a positive titer for HBV core antibody. Additional data 
for viral safety were provided, in particular with reference to positive or shifted titers of HCV, HBV core, and 
parvovirus B19 antibodies. Assessment of these data did not indicate safety concerns.  
The occurrence of neutralising antibodies and/or binding antibodies to VWF product and/or FVIII is a general 
safety concern. In line with the core SmPC guideline for VWF products a statement about the occurrence of 
inhibitory antibodies in VWD patients, in particular Type 3 VWD, is part of the Veyvondi SmPC. Regarding 
immunogenicity of Veyvondi, no neutralising antibodies directed against VWF or FVIII have been found 
throughout the clinical development program. One subject with Type 3 VWD developed anti-VWF binding 
antibodies in the surgery study but no AEs were reported for this subject. No subject had an increase of 
binding antibodies against impurities of Veyvondi. Although the overall number of subjects analysed with 
regard to immunogenicity is considered sufficient in this orphan setting in general, there are limited safety 
data available from repeated treatment with Veyvondi and concerns were raised on how to conclude on long-
term safety and how to assess the long-term risk for immunogenicity. Long-term assessment of safety will 
be covered by routine pharmacovigilance measures as well as safety monitoring during an observational and 
a prophylaxis study (a Real World Safety and Effectiveness Study of Factor Replacement for Clinically Severe 
von Willebrand Disease (VWD), [VON (BAX0111) VWF-500 COL], please see RMP below. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile is considered acceptable. The most common adverse events were the following: 
dizziness, vertigo, dysgeusia, tremor, tachycardia, deep venous thrombosis, hypertension, hot flush, 
vomiting, nausea, pruritus generalised, chest discomfort, infusion site paraesthesia, electrocardiogram T 
wave inversion, heart rate increased. Most of the listed AEs are expected for treatment with VWF products or 
blood coagulation factors and mostly regarded as infusion or hypersensitivity reaction.  
Special warnings including hypersensitivity reactions, thrombosis and embolism and neutralising antibodies 
are described in section 4.4 of the SmPC (see also RMP). Regarding thrombogenicity of Veyvondi, two

patients experienced thrombotic AEs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) which were considered serious and 
related by the applicant. Reference to the 2 cases of DVT has been made in Section 4.8 of the SmPC under 
subheading “description of selected adverse reactions”.  In terms of immunogenicity, no substantial safety 
signals occurred at present time, however it is acknowledged that there is limited long-term safety data. 
Long-term assessment of safety will be covered by routine pharmacovigilance measures as well as safety 
monitoring during an observational and a prophylaxis study (a Real World Safety and Effectiveness Study of 
Factor Replacement for Clinically Severe von Willebrand Disease (VWD), [VON (BAX0111) VWF-500 COL],

Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation activities are sufficient to manage the safety concerns of the medicinal product. 
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 8 December 2015. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the 
IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. The first DPL will be 31 December 2018. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP concluded that the structural differences between 
recombinant vonicog alfa and plasma-derived von Willebrand Factor are not sufficient to claim new active 
substance (NAS) status in itself. The basic molecular structure (amino acid sequence) is the same for both. 
Considering the NTA’s third indent, CHMP was of the opinion that, the differences in properties of vonicog 
alfa with regard to safety and/or efficacy compared to plasma-derived Von Willebrand Factor/FVIII contained 
in medicinal product(s) previously authorised within the European Union are not sufficient and therefore, is 
not considered to be a new active substance. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Veyvondi (vonicog alfa) is included in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 105/113 
  
  
 
 
additional monitoring list as it is a biological medicine authorised after 1 January 2011. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Veyvondi is indicated in adults (age 18 and older) with von Willebrand Disease (VWD), when desmopressin 
(DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or not indicated for the treatment of haemorrhage and surgical 
bleeding and the prevention of surgical bleeding.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The main available treatment options in VWD depend on type and severity and therapeutic response. 
Desmopressin is commonly used in milder VWD forms to release endogenous VWF. Antifibrinolytics such as 
aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid are often used in the treatment of BEs occurring after minor surgeries 
or trauma. Additionally, fibrin sealants can be used to support wound healing and particularly in women, oral 
contraceptives and intrauterine devices may be used to control menstrual bleedings. Patients who cannot 
take desmopressin or need extended treatment, who have Type 1 VWD unresponsive to desmopressin, or 
have Type 2 or 3 VWD receive VWF replacement therapy. Currently, pdVWF products are used in the 
management of BEs, surgical procedures and prophylaxis. Available pdVWF concentrates are of intermediate 
to high purity and all of them contain FVIII in different amounts. VWF:RCo/FVIII ratios differ between 0.82 
and 50 depending on the source plasma and the manufacturing process and this could lead to excessive 
FVIII levels.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical studies of Veyvondi supporting the clinical development program are the following: 
• 
• 
• 
Phase 1 Study 070701: investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of rVWF 
administered with rFVIII (ADVATE) in subjects with severe von Willebrand Disease (VWD)  
Phase 3 Study 071001: investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of rVWF with or 
without rFVIII (ADVATE) in the treatment of bleeding episodes in subjects with VWD  
Phase 3 Study 071101: investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of rVWF with or 
without rFVIII (ADVATE) in subjects with severe VWD undergoing major or minor elective surgical 
procedures 
Phase 1 Study 071104: investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of rVWF in combination 
with rFVIII (ADVATE) in subjects with severe hemophilia A, this was considered as a supportive study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 106/113 
  
  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Veyvondi is the first recombinant VWF developed for substitution therapy in VWD disease. 3 clinical studies 
were conducted in VWD patients and one study was conducted in haemophilia A patients considered as 
supportive for PK and safety analyses. The general concept of the development program, study design and 
patient numbers are in accordance with the current EMA guideline for pdVWF products. 
PK assessments show that Veyvondi has a PK profile which is partly comparable to pdVWF (study 070701 
and 071001) as statistical significant increases of in AUC0-∞, MRT and t 1/2 for rVWF administered alone or in 
combination with rFVIII have been demonstrated when compared with a plasma-derived VWF:FVIII product.  
If administered without FVIII, it was shown (study 071001) that Veyvondi increased endogenous FVIII levels 
substantially reaching elimination kinetics similar as if co-administered with rFVIII. When compared to 
endogenous VWF or pdVWF, Veyvondi contains a higher amount of ultra-large or high-molecular weight 
multimers with high efficacy in platelet mediated adhesion and aggregation. It was demonstrated that the 
larger multimers gradually disappear after blood exposure in a comparable manner as shown for pdVWF and 
that multimeric distribution of Veyvondi is sufficiently regulated by the Willebrand factor-cleaving plasma 
protease ADAMTS13. 
The clinical efficacy of Veyvondi has been investigated in two Phase 3 studies in adult VWD patients (study 
071001 and study 071101).  
In the pivotal Phase 3 study (071001) efficacy of Veyvondi in the treatment of BEs could be demonstrated. 
Haemostatic efficacy, expressed as the number of subjects with a treatment success for treated BEs 
prospectively assessed and including gastrointestinal bleeds has been demonstrated, i.e. was 95% (Clopper-
Pearson exact 95% CI: 75.1 to 99.9). Secondary endpoint analysis showed that the proportion of Veyvondi-
treated BEs (including GI bleeds) with an ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ efficacy rating was 97.7% (127/130, Clopper-
Pearson exact 95% CI: 93.4 to 99.5). Haemostatic efficacy was rated excellent in 184/192 (95.8%), good in 
4/192 (2.1%), moderate in 3/192 (1.6%) and none in 1/192 (0.5%) BEs. Data on consumption show that 
most BEs were controlled with one infusion of Veyvondi and doses of approximately 50 IU/kg (52.8 IU/kg if 
administered alone and 46.5 IU/kg if co-administered with FVIII) are required to achieve haemostatic 
efficacy. 
In the Phase 3 surgery study (071101), intraoperative and overall (perioperative) haemostatic efficacy has 
been demonstrated for 81.9% to 100% of the 15 subjects of which 10 were scheduled for major surgery. In 
this study, all subjects were treated preoperatively with priming and loading dose of Veyvondi, i.e. 55.0 and 
35.8 IU/kg respectively, one subjects received intraoperatively Veyvondi and postoperative doses ranged 
between 16.3 and 50.8 IU/kg. 
Overall, efficacy and consumption of Veyvondi in the treatment of BEs and perioperative management are 
comparable with those of pdVWF products. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Several issues of study 071001 have been identified which relate to patient assignment, sample size, home 
treatment, the use of concomitant medication, retrospective efficacy assessment and statistical issues. 
However, the possible methodological flaws are considered not likely to have a qualitative impact on the 
primary efficacy assessment but the uncertainties and potential for bias could impair quantitative estimates 
such as the proportion of bleeding events with treatment success. However, given the clear observed effect 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204179/2018 
Page 107/113 
  
  
in the primary and key secondary endpoints, it is unlikely that these issues could have a qualitative impact 
on the primary efficacy analysis. Thus, any potential over-estimation of efficacy is not considered important. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of Veyvondi was evaluated throughout four completed clinical trials and is based on 80 
unique VWD patients. Safety, i.e. monitoring of AEs, development of antibodies to VWF, FVIII, and 
impurities as well as haematology, clinical chemistry and vital signs was assessed in accordance with the 
clinical VWF guideline. A sufficient number of VWD patients have been exposed for treatment of BEs, during 
surgical procedures and for PK analysis. Mean exposure doses are within a range comparable to pdVWF 
products. 
The risk profile of Veyvondi is characterised by unfavourable effects known from pdVWF products and as 
expected for the drug class of blood coagulation factors. Of the AEs which have been assessed as treatment 
related, most can be attributed to infusion or hypersensitivity reactions including pruritus, flush, nausea, 
dizziness, paraesthesia, tachycardia and chest discomfort. Few AEs were related to the nervous system such 
as dizziness, dysgeusia and tremor. No substantial concerns have been raised with regards to haematology 
or clinical chemistry. Binding antibodies against VWF have been detected in one subject, no neutralising 
antibodies or antibodies against impurities occurred. 
Special warnings including hypersensitivity reactions, thrombosis and embolism and neutralising antibodies 
are described in section 4.4 of the SmPC (see also RMP). The occurrence of thrombotic events is a general 
safety concern in the treatment of VWD patients with VWF products, in particular, if FVIII is co-administered 
or FVIII levels show excessive rise. Additionally, low levels of the ADAMTS13 protease pose an additional the 
risk of thrombotic events. 2 patients (one case occurred in the surgery study, the other case occurred during 
the post-marketing phase in the US) experienced thrombotic events assessed by the Sponsor/Company as 
serious and related to Vonvendi/Veyvondi treatment. Reference to both cases of DVT has been made in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
80 unique subjects included in the safety analysis set are considered acceptable to constitute a solid 
database for common AEs such as hypersensitivity related reactions. However, the population is too small to 
adequately address rare unfavourable effects, in particular to cover important identified risks as outlined in 
the RMP, i.e. inhibitor formation and thromboembolic events. Post-marketing data are required to address 
these uncertainties. Long-term assessment of safety will be covered by routine pharmacovigilance measures 
as well as safety monitoring during an observational and a prophylaxis study (a Real World Safety and 
Effectiveness Study of Factor Replacement for Clinically Severe von Willebrand Disease (VWD), [VON 
(BAX0111) VWF-500 COL], (please see RMP).  
No clinical data on Veyvondi use in geriatric patients or in pregnancy and lactation are available.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The favourable effects of Veyvondi in the treatment of BEs and in the management of perioperative 
bleedings are of major importance as they have positive effects on VWD-related bleeding events, reduce 
morbidity and support increase of life expectancy of VWD patients. Key favourable effects of Veyvondi are 
the haemostatic efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties supported by the presence of ultra-large VWF 
multimers in the drug product. Additionally, the absence of FVIII (VWF:RCo/FVIII ratio >100) in Veyvondi 
enables an improved therapeutic control as it reduces the risk for excessive FVIII levels and therefore, 
reduce the risk for thromboembolic events which may result from excessive FVIII levels. 2 cases of deep 
vein thrombosis have been reported for rVWF treatment, i.e. in the US during the post-marketing phase of 
Vonvendi and in the surgery study. Both have been assessed as serious and treatment related by the 
Sponsor/Company, one case in the surgery study was associated with additional risk factors (total hip 
replacement, obesity, and low ADAMTS13 level), and a case narrative of the case from the post-marketing 
phase is not available. Specific reference to these cases has been included in the SmPC and the Applicant 
has outlined a strategy to further substantiate the safety database to address the identified and potential 
risks of Veyvondi use.  
Unfavourable effects include hypersensitivity or infusion related reactions which are common for treatment 
with VWF products and other blood coagulation factors. Inhibitor formation did not occur during the clinical 
studies. Long-term assessment of safety will be covered by routine pharmacovigilance measures as well as 
safety monitoring during an observational and a prophylaxis study (a Real World Safety and Effectiveness 
Study of Factor Replacement for Clinically Severe von Willebrand Disease (VWD), [VON (BAX0111) VWF-500 
COL], (please see RMP).  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The beneficial effects of Veyvondi in the treatment of adult VWD patients are considered positive. Overall, 
submitted data support the proposed indication and are considered acceptable to support marketing 
authorisation of Veyvondi. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The initially claimed indication to include prevention of bleeding episodes could not be granted because no 
studies or data have been provided supporting the claim for prophylaxis. Initially, the indication included 
patients generally diagnosed with VWD and did not restrict treatment to patients diagnosed with VWD, when 
desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contra-indicated. As no data or studies have been 
provided to support this claim, the indication was not accepted and the indication was revised in accordance 
with the EMA recommendation and the guideline on the core SPC for human pdVWF (CPMP/BPWG/278/02).  
The indication as outlined in the SmPC is for VWD patients when desmopressin treatment alone is ineffective 
or not indicated is considered acceptable. It was also considered not acceptable to add “and control” in the 
indication “treatment and control of haemorrhage” as no rationale and supportive evidence was provided. 
The indication as currently outlined is in accordance with the VWF Core SPC guideline and supported by the 
submitted data and thus considered acceptable.

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of the available data and considering the NTA’s first indent of NAS definition, the CHMP 
concludes that vonicog alfa, which has some differences in molecular structure, nature of the source material 
and manufacturing process compared to vWF active substances contained in products already licensed in the 
EU, but contains the same basic structural elements (amino acid sequence), is not a new active substance in 
itself.  
Furthermore, considering the NTA’s third indent, evidence for differences in properties with regard to safety 
and/or efficacy is not considered sufficient by the CHMP to classify vonicog alfa as new active substance.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1 
Introduction 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH),  received  the  Centralised  Marketing  Authorisation  on 
18 September  1998  for  Aldara  (imiquimod)  5%  cream.  Imiquimod  is  indicated  for  the  topical 
treatment  of  external  genital  and  perianal  warts  (condylomata  acuminata)  in  adult  patients.  In  July 
2004, the indication for small superficial basal cell carcinomas was approved. 
The  proposed  amendments  relate  to  an  update  of  the  SPC  and  consequential  changes  to  the  PL  of 
Aldara  5%  cream,  to  extend  the  therapeutic  indication  to  include  the  topical  treatment  of  clinically 
typical,  nonhyperkeratotic,  nonhypertrophic  actinic  keratoses  (AKs)  on  the  face  or  scalp  in  adult 
patients. 
The proposed posology is one or two courses of imiquimod applied 3x/week for 4 weeks. The MAH 
received CHMP scientific advice in August 2000. A previous submission which sought an extension 
for the same therapeutic indication but with a longer treatment duration (3x/week for 16 weeks) was 
withdrawn by the MAH in March 2004 as major objections had been identified by the CHMP. 
New data are available from one pharmacology study, four short-term trials, three long-term trials and 
six published studies.  
Imiquimod  belongs  to  the  class  of  imidazoquinolinamines.  Imiquimod  is  an  immune  response 
modifier  that  triggers  toll-like  receptors  (TLR)  on  antigen-presenting  cells  such  as  monocytes/ 
macrophages and dendritic cells. Activation of TLR-7 results in increased transcription of cytokines, 
important  in  the  innate  immune  responses,  and  by  stimulating  trafficking  of  dendritic  cells  to  the 
regional lymph nodes, enhances the adaptive cell-mediated immune response in a manner consistent 
with a T-helper type 1 cell-mediated immunity.  
1.1  Proposed new indication 
Imiquimod  cream  is  indicated  for  the  topical  treatment  of  ….  clinically  typical,  nonhyperkeratotic, 
nonhypertrophic actinic keratoses (AKs) on the face or scalp, in adult patients. 
1.2  Proposed posology and method of administration 
The application frequency for imiquimod cream is different for each indication. 
Posology 
“Actinic keratosis in adults:  Apply imiquimod cream 3 times per week (example: Monday, Wednesday 
and  Friday)  prior  to  normal  sleeping  hours,  and  leave  on  the  skin  for  approximately  8  hours.  
Continue imiquimod cream treatment for 4 weeks.  After a 4-week treatment-free period the physician 
should assess the treated area to determine clearance of AKs. If any AKs persist in the treatment area, 
apply imiquimod cream 3 times per week for an additional 4 weeks (for a maximum total treatment 
duration of 8 weeks). 
If  you  miss  a  dose,  apply  the  cream  as  soon  as  you  remember  and  then  continue  with  your  regular 
schedule. Do not apply the cream more than once in any day.” 
Method of administration 
“Before applying imiquimod cream, patients should wash the treatment area with mild soap and water 
and  dry  thoroughly.    Sufficient  cream  should  be  applied  to  cover  the  treatment  area.    The  cream 
should be rubbed into the treatment area until the cream vanishes.  The cream should be applied prior 
to  normal  sleeping  hours  and  remain  on  the  skin  for  approximately  8  hours.    During  this  period, 
showering  and  bathing  should  be  avoided.    After  this  period  it  is  essential  that  imiquimod  cream  is 
removed  with  mild  soap  and  water.  Sachets  should  not  be  re-used  once  opened.  Hands  should  be 
washed carefully before and after application of cream.  Clearance of AKs should be assessed at 4-8 
weeks following each treatment period.  A rest period of several days may be taken (see section 4.4) if

the local skin reaction to imiquimod cream causes excessive discomfort to the patient, or if infection is 
observed at the treatment site.  In this latter case, appropriate other measures should be taken.” 
1.3  Problem statement: Actinic Keratosis 
Actinic keratoses are common sun-induced precancerous lesions confined to the epidermis. Prevalence 
increases with advancing age. The majority (approximately 60%) of lesions are located on the upper 
limbs (Salasche S, J Am Acad Dermatol 2000; 42:S4-7).  There are five clinical types: erythematous 
(desquamative-keratotic),  keratotic  papular,  verrucous  or  papillomatous,  pigmented  and  cutaneous 
horn. The vast majority of lesions are asymptomatic.  Actinic keratoses may sometimes be associated 
with mild local irritation and pruritus and may be undesirable to the patient because of the cosmetic 
appearance. Lesions  may  regress  spontaneously,  with  annual  regression  rates  of  approximately  25% 
(Marks R et al, Br J Dermatol, 1986, 115,649-655).  On the other hand, actinic keratoses may progress 
to   squamous cell carcinoma with a potential to metastasize estimated at around 3-6%.  The chance of 
any  given  lesion  developing  into  a  squamous  cell  carcinoma  is  unknown.  Relative  risks   depend  on 
factors related to the lesion itself (e.g. thickness) as well as individual patient characteristics.  Patients 
with actinic keratoses at thermal injuries and large scars, with immunosuppression, human papilloma 
virus  infection  and  lesions  on  mucosal  surfaces  have  an  increased  risk  of  malignant  transformation 
(Butani  A  et  al,  Clin  Plastic  Surg  32(2005)223-235).   The  primary  rationale  of  treating  actinic 
keratosis is the prevention of progression to squamous cell carcinoma. 
Pathogenesis of Actinic Keratosis 
Risk factors for AKs include fair skin that burns easily and tans poorly, increasing age, male gender, 
reduced  immune  response  after  solid  organ  transplantation,  and  HPV  infection.  The  primary 
pathogenesis of AKs and SCC stems from the effects of chronic UV damage to the keratinocyte. The 
energy from UVR can induce dimerisation between adjacent deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) pyrimidine 
bases, resulting in mutations in the DNA. Mutations in the regulatory tumour suppressor gene p53 can 
be  particularly  harmful.  Programmed  cell  death  of  genetically  altered  keratinocytes  (apoptosis)  is  a 
p53-dependent  process  that  guards  against  early  neoplastic  cell  survival.  If  both  copies  of  the 
regulatory  tumour  suppressor  gene  p53  have  mutated  as  a  result  of  UVR,  its  protective  role  is  lost. 
This  leads  to  preservation  of  transformed  keratinocytes  that  can  mutate  and  develop  into  AKs.  In 
addition to inducing cell mutations, UVR also appears to attenuate the recognition of malignant cells 
by  cell-mediated  immunity  (CMI).  By  weakening  the  immune  response,  chronic  UVR  induces  a 
reduced  antitumour  immune  defence.  This  suppression  has  been  shown  to  play  a  significant  role  in 
development of SCC and may be a factor in the transformation rate of AKs into SCCs. 
Currently available therapies for Actinic Keratosis 
The most common current therapies for AKs are: 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a cytotoxic agent, administered topically 
- 
-  Topical  Photodynamic  Therapy  (PDT)  consists  of  an  application  of  photosensitiser  (eg, 
methyl  aminolevulinate),  which  preferentially  localises  in  tumor  tissue  with  subsequent 
illumination with appropriate light to produce reactive oxygen intermediates 
-  Diclofenac 3% in 2.5% hyaluronan gel is a cyclooxigenase inhibitor 
-  Curettage and electrodesiccation scrape lesion away, then achieve hemostasis with electrical 
current 
-  Cryotherapy is a method which uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and destroy tissue. 
AKs frequently involve a large part of the exposed skin with multiple lesions. Cryotherapy is not an 
easily acceptable option when numerous or big lesions must be treated.

Nonclinical aspects 
Non-clinical data are available from an SKH-1 hairless mouse model of UV irradiation induced actinic 
keratosis  (Study  Imiquimod-020702-001).    The  results  of  this  trial  were  previously  submitted  and 
assessed.   
The objective of this study was to determine whether imiquimod could reduce actinic keratosis lesions 
induced in the SKH-1 mouse model by low levels of UV irradiation.  0.6%, 1% and 3% imiquimod 
cream were topically applied three times a week for 3-4 weeks.  Actinic keratosis lesions were reduced 
by 24%, 27% and 59%, respectively.  5% imiquimod cream was not tolerated and 0.1% had no effect. 
Increases  in  IL-12,  interferon,  monocyte  chemoattractant  protein-1   (MCP-1)  and  TNFα  were 
observed  following  1%  and  5%  imiquimod  application.   The  observations  are  consistent  with  the 
hypothesis  that  stimulated  immune  responses  may  contribute  to  inhibition  and  resolution  of  actinic 
keratosis  lesions.   The  model  suggests  imiquimod  may  have  potential  in  the  treatment  of  actinic 
keratosis.

Clinical aspects 
3.1 
Clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  development  programme  for  actinic  keratosis  includes  seven  previously  submitted  and 
assessed phase I trials and a new phase II study (1467-IMIQ).  From these, two studies have explored 
the  mechanism  of  action  of  imiquimod  on  AKs:  1467-IMIQ  evaluated  3x/week  dosing  for  4  weeks, 
and 1428-IMIQ evaluated 3x/week dosing for 16 weeks.

Imiquimod and vehicle cream 
(100 μl): 
1x/d (Mon-Sat) for 3 weeks, 
then 1x/d  (Mon-Th) for  1 
week (22) 
Results 
Sunburn cell and pyrimidine dimer 
analyses showed that imiquimod did not 
increase the response of white skin to 
UVR exposure.   
Imiquimod and vehicle cream 
(250 mg): 
1x/d, 3x/week for 4 weeks 
(12), or  
1x/d, 7x/week for 4 weeks (28)

Face group: 1 sachet/dose 1x/d, 
3x/wk for 16 wks (48) 
Scalp group: 2 sachets/dose 
1x/d, 3x/wk for 16 wks (48) 
Hands/arms group: 
6 sachets/dose 1x/d, 3x/wk for 
16 wks (48) 
Imiquimod or vehicle cream 
(250 mg ) : 
1x/d, 3d/wk for 16 wks or until 
clear, whichever occurred first 
(up to 48) 
There were minimal histological changes 
noted in healthy skin during the conduct 
of this study. No trends were seen 
between imiquimod and vehicle treated 
sites or any dose frequency related trends 
between the imiquimod treatment 
groups. 
Systemic imiquimod serum 
concentrations were generally low, 
providing a large safety margin. Using 
the calculated area-under-the-curve 
values, safety margins for the three 
topical doses were found to be 303, 128, 
and 11, respectively. 
The imiquimod group showed 
statistically significant increases from 
baseline to week 2 levels for CD3, CD4, 
CD8, CD11c, CD86/CD11c double stain, 
CD68, HLA-DR, and TUNEL. No 
significant correlations between 
clearance and week 2 biomarker levels 
were seen for the imiquimod group. 
Study 1467-IMIQ 
This phase II study was performed to assess apoptosis by examining the gene expression profiles of 
actinic keratosis lesions.   
Seventeen    male  subjects  with  7-13  actinic  keratosis  lesions  on  the  scalp  were  randomised  to  either 
imiquimod 5% cream or vehicle cream (3:1 randomisation) once daily 3 times per week for 4 weeks.  
Pre-treatment biopsies were taken from AKs lesions, non-lesioned sun-exposed and non-lesioned sun-
unexposed areas. Biopsies of different lesions were taken at study weeks 1, 2, and 4, and four weeks 
post-treatment.  Gene  expression  in  shaved  biopsy  samples  was  studied  qualitatively  by  gene  chip 
technology and quantitatively by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Clinical 
efficacy was not evaluated in this study. 
Observed changes were increased expression of several Toll-like receptor genes, induction of antiviral 
and  antitumor  IFN-inducible  genes,  increased  expression  of  proapoptotic  genes  and  of  genes  that 
indicate  infiltration  and  activation  of  immune  cells  such  as  natural  killer  cells  and  plasmacytoid 
dendritic  cells,  increased  induction  of  genes  that  suggest  the  up-regulation  of  the  adaptive  immune 
system and reversal of some tumour immune evasion mechanisms. However, the study presents some 
limitations that make the interpretation of the results awkward and do not allow definite conclusions to 
be drawn about genetic expression during the course of the disease and treatment. Moreover, efficacy 
was not evaluated in this study so no correlation can be done with these biomarkers and efficacy.

3.2 Clinical efficacy 
The  clinical  development  programme  for  actinic  keratosis  includes  seven  phase  I,  five  phase  II  and 
eleven phase III (nine short-term studies and two long-term) studies.  A further long-term study was 
submitted during the evaluation of this variation. 
A tabular overview of these trials is presented in the Table 2.

Main studies 
Pivotal short-term studies: Study  1473-IMIQ and Study 1487-IMIQ 
Two new pivotal studies have been submitted: 
•  Study  1473-IMIQ  was  conducted  at  13  centres  in  the  US  between  October  2003  and  July 
2004. 
•  Study  1487-IMIQ  was  conducted  at  20  centres  in  Europe  between  December  2003  and 
November 2004. 
These studies were essentially of identical design, with the exception that the European study included 
biopsies. 
Study participants, target lesions 
Subjects  were  required  to  have  4  to  8  (study  1487:  5-9)  clinically  typical,  visible,  discrete, 
nonhyperkeratotic,  nonhypertrophic  AKs  lesions  located  within  a  contiguous  25cm2  treatment  area 
(balding scalp or face, but not both).   
Identification of actinic keratosis was based on clinical evaluation by a qualified dermatologist and in 
study 1487 confirmed by biopsy.  One representative lesion was biopsied before therapy, and another 
lesion was identified to be biopsied 8 weeks post-treatment. 
Biopsy  specimens  were  assessed  by  two  independent  blinded  dermatopathologists  in  a  central 
laboratory.  In cases of disagreement, a consensus diagnosis was reached. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomised to either imiquimod 5% cream or vehicle three times a week, applied before 
going to bed, for one or two courses of four weeks each, with four weeks between courses.

Primary endpoints: 
1)  To  compare  imiquimod  and  vehicle  cream  with  respect  to  the  complete  clearance  rate  after 
Course One 
2)  To compare imiquimod and vehicle with respect to the overall complete clearance rate.   
Clearance was assessed both clinically (4 and 8 weeks post-treatment) and histologically (8 weeks post 
treatment)  in  study  1487.    In  study  1473,  only  clinical  assessment  was  performed  (4  weeks  post-
treatment for patients who had only one course, and 4 or 8 weeks post-treatment for subjects who had 
had two courses).   
Complete clearance was defined as no clinical (and histological) evidence of AKs in the treatment area 
at the above time points. 
Secondary endpoints: 
The secondary endpoints included the following:  
• 
Partial clearance rate, defined as the proportion of subjects at their last study visit who had at 
least 75% reduction in the number of AKs lesions counted at baseline in the treatment area. If 
the  post-treatment  biopsy was  positive  for  AKs  or  was  not  done,  this  lesion  was  considered 
present in the count of AKs lesions;  
Partial  clearance  rate  after  Course  One,  defined  as  the  proportion  of  subjects  at  the  Course 
One  4-week  post-treatment  visit  with  at  least  75%  reduction  in  the  number  of  AKs  lesions 
counted at baseline in the treatment area)  
Clearance  rate  of  individual  AKs  lesions.  The  reduction  in  individual  AKs  lesions  from 
baseline was summarised. 
• 
• 
Results 
246 patients were included in study 1473, and 259 in study 1487.  
In both studies the majority of patients were of male gender, had either Fitzpatrick skin type II or III 
and had had previous AK treatments.  The median number of baseline lesions was 6, except for the 
vehicle group in 1487-IMIQ who had a median of 7.  All patients but one were “white”.  The median 
age was 65 to 73 years.   
Treatment  of  actinic  keratosis  with  imiquimod  provided  significant  benefit  when  compared  to 
treatment with vehicle at 4 to 8 weeks post-treatment.  A statistically significant difference was seen 
for all primary and secondary efficacy outcomes after one or two courses of treatment.  Tables 3a and 
3b below summarise the results for primary and secondary endpoints.

The MAH has presented comparisons with published clearance rates for licensed topical treatments of 
AK.  The CHMP agrees  that the short-term lesion clearance rates appear to be in the same order of 
magnitude  for  imiquimod  and  other  topical  treatments  but  the  comparison  is  problematic  due  to  a 
number of factors such as comparison with treatments not licensed in the EU, open-label trial design, 
location  and  size  of  target  lesions,  timings  of  assessment,  etc.    Robust  comparative  data  should  be 
submitted as a postmarketing commitment. 
Long-Term Follow-Up Studies 
The MAH has submitted results from three studies providing long-term data.  These trials evaluated 
recurrence and local skin reactions and skin quality following treatment with either 1 or 2 four-week 
courses of imiquimod 3x/week (1518-IMIQ: follow-up of study 1473-IMIQ, 1524-IMIQ: follow-up of 
study  1487-IMIQ)  or  16  weeks  of  continuous  treatment  with  imiquimod  2x/week  or  3  times  /week 
(1486-IMIQ: follow-up of studies 1444, 1445, 1446 and 1447-IMIQ). 
Study  1518  and  1524  provide  data  relevant  to  the  proposed  dosing  schedule.  The  duration  of  the 
follow-up studies is limited to one year.  Trial 1486-IMIQ is summarised in table 2. 
1518-IMIQ and 1524-IMIQ 
Trials  1518-IMIQ  and  1524-IMIQ  were  both  single-visit  studies  providing  observational  follow-up 
data  on  subjects  who  had  completely  cleared  their  AKs  in  the  pivotal  short-term  trials  at  any of  the 
post-treatment visits in trials 1473-IMIQ and 1487-IMIQ.

The primary endpoint was the patient based recurrence rate.  Subjects with at least 1 AKs lesion in the 
treatment area at the follow-up visit or who had received interventions related to AKs or SCC in the 
treatment area were considered to have a recurrence.  
Assessment of the previous treatment area for recurrences, suspicious lesions, local skin reactions and 
skin quality was performed by a qualified dermatologist.  Lesions suspicious for malignancy were to 
be removed and specimens sent to a central dermatopathologist for confirmation of clinical diagnosis.  
Information  was  collected  on  any  dermatologist-confirmed  diagnoses  and  therapies  in  the  treatment 
area since the completion of the previous studies.

Calculated  across  trials  1518-  and  1524-IMIQ  the  lesion  recurrence  rate  for  imiquimod  is  5.6% 
(41/737)  and  the  patient-based  recurrence  rate  27%  (35/128).    Corresponding  recurrence  rates  for 
vehicle are 7.5% (6/80 lesions) are 47% (8/17 patients). 
A comparison of data obtained from trials 1518- and 1524-IMIQ with those data cited in literature for 
other  treatments  is  problematic  due  to  factors  such  as  different  study  design,  treatment  areas  (e.g. 
head,  extremities),  and  lengths  of  follow-up  periods.    Therefore  a  robust  conclusion  regarding 
comparative long-term efficacy cannot be drawn.  
It is considered that the reported recurrence rates are within an acceptable range. The MAH has been 
requested to provide robust comparative data as a postmarketing commitment. 
Progression to squamous cell carcinoma:   
Data  from  three  ‘long-term’  trials  indicate  that  1.15%  (3/259)  of  imiquimod-patients  and  0%  (0/32) 
vehicle-patients had developed SCC within the follow-up period.  A comparison of imiquimod versus 
vehicle rates is hampered by unequal group sizes.

The rate of progression on a per-patient basis at one year (1.15% for all studies, 1.6% for trials using 
the  proposed  posology  only)  is  comparable  to  that  presented  in  published  literature  using  a 
mathematical model (Dodson 1991).  Although the MAH has not submitted a calculation of rates of 
progression  on  a  per-lesion  basis,  it  would  appear  that  at  0.2%  this,  too,  is  in  the  range  reported  in 
literature  (Marks  1986,  1988).  A  comparison  of  imiquimod  versus  vehicle  rates  is  hampered  by 
unequal group sizes.   
The  comparison  of  progression  rates  for  imiquimod  to  those  reported  in  literature  suffers  from 
limitations such as different study design, different lengths of follow-up, etc. 
Bibliographic evidence 
The  MAH  has  presented  six  published  studies  to  provide  further  evidence  for  imiquimod  in  the 
treatment of actinic keratosis.   
Discussion 
The CHMP requested to restrict the indication to immunocompetent patients in whom size or number 
of lesions limit the efficacy and/or acceptability of cryotherapy and other topical treatment options are 
contraindicated or less appropriate.  This restriction was based on the conclusion that the proposed 
patient population is likely to be elderly and suffer from concomitant diseases (e.g. occult carcinoma 
with  reduced  haematologic  reserve)  that  may  make  them  more  vulnerable  to  some  of  imiquimod’s 
adverse effects, that the condition to be treated in itself is not malignant, that the established benefit is 
limited  to  clearing  certain  types  of  actinic  keratosis  lesions,  that  the  benefit  with  regard  to  the 
prevention  of  progression  to  squamous  cell  carcinoma  has  not  been  established  and  that  treatment 
options with a more favourable safety profile are available. 
To avoid ambiguity in the product information a warning statement to exclude the treatment of AKs 
lesions  with  marked  hyperkeratosis  or  hypertrophy  such  as  seen  in  cutaneous  horns  was  added  to 
section 4.4.   
A  restriction  to  specialist  use  was  also  discussed.    This  was  based  on  the  concern  about  the  low 
positive predictive value of the clinical diagnosis of AK (approximately 70%) even when diagnosis is 
made  by  a  specialist,  with  the  potential  of  misdiagnosing  malignant  lesions  as  AK.  As  any  concern 
over significant discrepancies between clinical and histological diagnosis of the condition would be an 
issue  relevant  to  any  treatment  for  AK,  it  was  considered  that  restriction  to  specialist  use  for 
imiquimod only would not be justified. 
Application frequency and duration of treatment 
Two  trials  demonstrated  that  imiquimod  at  the  proposed  posology  is  superior  to  placebo  in  clearing 
actinic  keratosis  lesions  when  assessed  at  4  to  8  weeks  post-treatment.    Trials  investigating  longer 
treatment duration (16 weeks) did not demonstrate higher short-term clearance rates.  A comparison of 
“long-term” (approximately one-year) follow-up data indicated that recurrence rates were higher when 
imiquimod  was  administered  2x/week  for  16  weeks  as  compared  to  3x/week.    These  data,  taken 
together, were accepted as adequate justification for the proposed posology. 
Concentration 
The  issue  of  whether  a  concentration  of  <  5%  imiquimod  would  be  effective  and  give  fewer  side-
effects was discussed.  In external genital warts trials, a 1% concentration revealed a lack of efficacy, 
indicating  inadequate  tissue  concentration.    Considering  that  actinic  keratosis  lesions  are  not  less 
keratinized  than  external  genital  warts,  the  MAH  concludes  that  the  5%  concentration  is  also 
appropriate  for  adequate  penetration  in  treating  actinic  keratosis.      Since  clinical  efficacy  has  been 
demonstrated  for  the  5%  cream  for  actinic  keratosis,  the  extrapolation  of  concentration  data  from 
external genital warts to actinic keratosis was considered acceptable.

Short-term efficacy 
The two pivotal short-term trials demonstrated that treatment of actinic keratosis provided significant 
short-term  benefit  when  compared  to  vehicle.    Direct  comparative  data  to  cryotherapy  or  licensed 
topical treatments (5-FU, diclofenac, methyl-5-aminolevulinate) are not available. Comparisons with 
data reported in literature suffer from several flaws and limitations, but indicate that short-term lesion 
clearance  rates  for  imiquimod  are  within  the  same  order  of  magnitude  as  reported  for  other  topical 
treatments. 
Long term efficacy – Recurrence rate 
Calculated  across  trials  1518-  and  1524-IMIQ  the  lesion  recurrence  rate  for  imiquimod  is  5.6% 
(41/737)  and  the  patient-based  recurrence  rate  27%  (35/128).    Corresponding  recurrence  rates  for 
vehicle are 7.5% (6/80 lesions) are 47% (8/17 patients).  CHMP considered these recurrence rates to 
be within an acceptable range for the observed period of time.  Recurrence rates at 3 years have not 
been determined. 
A comparison of data obtained from trials 1518- and 1524-IMIQ with those cited in literature for other 
topical  treatments  is  problematic  due  to  factors  such  as  different  study  design,  treatment  areas  and 
length of follow-up periods.  Therefore a robust conclusion regarding comparative long-term efficacy 
could not be drawn. 
Long term efficacy – Progression to squamous cell carcinoma 
The  initial  submission  included  incomplete  data  from  one  follow-up  trial  assessing  the  proposed 
posology.    The  results  indicated  that  3.4%  of  patients  had  progressed  to  squamous  cell  carcinoma 
within one year. Calculated on the basis of the additional data submitted during the procedure, the rate 
of progression on a per-patient basis at one year (1.15% for all studies (1518-, 1524- and 1486-IMIQ), 
1.6%  for  trials  using  the  proposed  posology  only)  is  comparable  to  that  presented  in  published 
literature  based  a  mathematical  model  (Dodson  1991).    Although  the  MAH  has  not  submitted  a 
calculation of rates of progression on a per-lesion basis, it would appear that at 0.2% this, too, is in the 
range reported in literature (Marks 1986). 
Comparative efficacy - Comparator trial 
Since  actinic  keratosis  can  progress  to  invasive  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  the  CHMP  had  requested 
that  the  MAH  provide  3-year  follow-up  data.    Furthermore,  the  absence  of  a  comparator  trial  was 
considered a concern since absence of comparative data hampers the evaluation of the benefit/risk for 
this indication. The MAH agrees to conduct a 3-year follow-up study as a postapproval commitment  
to investigate recurrence and progression rates and time to recurrence.   CHMP Scientific Advice will 
be sought for the design of this trial. 
3.3 
Clinical safety 
The  MAH  has  provided  an  integrated  safety  review  that  takes  into  consideration  the  entirety  of  the 
available safety data: a) across all studies in the clinical development programme, b) across all studies 
using the proposed posology.  
Extent of exposure 
The safety review submitted by the MAH includes 23 studies1 with 3243 patients.  The Summary of 
Clinical  Safety  states  that  five  studies  are  ongoing.    Safety  information  for  ongoing  studies  was 
reported up to 1 July 2005. 
Adverse events 
Eighteen  (18)  patients  died  in  completed  and  ongoing  studies,  14  on  imiquimod,  3  on  vehicle  and 
1 non-randomised patient.  None of the deaths were considered related to imiquimod. 
One  hundred  eighty  two  (182)  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  were  reported  by  107  patients.  118 
events were reported by 73 imiquimod subjects and 64 events were reported by 34 vehicle subjects.  
1 1176, 1244, 1249, 1252 (M. Bowen), 1270, 1281, 1359, 1381, 1402, 1428, 1436, 1443, 1444, 1445, 1446, 1447 , 1450,1459, 1467, 1473, 1486, 1487, 1502,

None of the SAEs were considered related to study drug except one patient had a possible metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma in an anatomical location outside the area treated with imiquimod that was 
considered as possibly related to study drug. 
In the completed phase I - III studies, 77 patients on imiquimod and 15 vehicle-patients discontinued 
treatment  due  to  adverse  events.    In  the  pivotal  short-term  studies  1473-  and  1487-IMIQ,  three 
imiquimod-patients and no vehicle-treated patient discontinued treatment due to local skin reactions.   
In  relation  to  non-serious  adverse  events  in  two  of  the  three  double-blind  comparative  studies 
assessing  the  proposed  posology  adverse  events  were  reported  in  56%  of  imiquimod-patients  and 
41.9%  of  vehicle-patients.  Application  site  reactions,  myalgia  and  fatigue  were  statistically 
significantly more common on imiquimod.   
itching,  burning,  erythema,  pain, 
Application site reactions 
A review of the two pivotal trials assessing the proposed posology demonstrated that application site 
reactions  such  as 
inflammation,  swelling  were  reported 
spontaneously  as  an  adverse  event  by  22.2%  of  imiquimod-treated  patients  versus  5.1%  on  vehicle-
treated  patients.    Local  skin  reactions  were  also  assessed  by  the  investigators  in  a  prospectively 
defined  manner  at  each  visit.    Erythema,  oedema,  vesicles,  erosion/ulceration,  weeping/exudate, 
flaking/scaling/dryness  and  scabbing/crusting  were  all  reported  very  commonly  (>1/10).    Erythema 
was  mostly  moderate  (51.2%  imiquimod  patients)  to  severe  (23.8%  imiquimod  patients),  the  other 
reactions  mostly  mild  to  moderate.    Local  skin  reactions  were  most  intense  at  week  4  and  were 
generally  less  intense  in  course  two  than  course  one.  Severe  erythema  was  the  most  commonly 
reported severe skin reaction. 
(Auto)immune conditions 
Recent  Periodic  Safety  Update  Reports  (PSURs)  have  raised  the  concern  that  imiquimod  may  be 
associated  with  stimulation  or  exacerbation  of  (auto)immune  conditions  such  as    thrombocytopenia, 
rheumatoid  arthritis,  psoriasis,  multiple  sclerosis,  Crohn’s  disease,  thyroiditis  and  SLE,  lichen 
sclerosus (PSUR no 9).  Since there is a potentially plausible mechanism of action for this effect and 
some of the cases strongly suggested causality, a warning statement that imiquimod cream should be 
used  with  caution  in  patients  with  autoimmune  conditions  had  been  added  to  the  SPC  (via  type  II 
variation 27). 
Alopecia 
In the integrated safety review across the imiquimod studies in the AKs development program, 7/1214 
(0.6%)  imiquimod  subjects  reported  alopecia  as  an  adverse  event  compared  to  0/981  (0%)  vehicle 
subjects.  Of the 7 events reported by imiquimod subjects, 5 were considered by the investigator to be 
related  to  study  drug.  To  reflect  this  information  the  following  text  is  introduced  in  Section  4.8: 
“Clinical  studies  investigating  the  use  of  imiquimod  for  the  treatment  of  actinic  keratosis  have 
detected  a  0.4%  (5/1214)  frequency  of  alopecia  at  the  treatment  site  or  surrounding  area.  
Postmarketing  reports  of  alopecia  occurring  during  the  treatment  of  sBCC  and  EGW  have  been 
received.” 
Serious skin reactions 
A  review  of  the  MAH’s  safety  databases  identified  8  reports  of  serious  skin  reactions  from  clinical 
trials (67 trials including 9872 patients) and 19 reports from the post-marketing safety database.  All 
cases identified from clinical trials were temporally associated with the use of imiquimod (n = 7) or 
vehicle (n = 1).  For two cases of exanthema, the outcome was reported as persistent.  The majority of 
spontaneously  reported  cases  were  reported  by  physicians.    In  one  case  erythema  multiforme  was 
confirmed by skin biopsy.  In several cases there was a temporal association with imiquimod use.  In 
several cases, the event abated after treatment was stopped.

A warning about serious skin reactions has been included in Section 4.8 of the SPC :“Rare cases of 
remote  site  dermatologic  drug  reactions,  including  erythema  multiforme,  have  been  reported  from 
clinical  trials.    Serious  skin  reactions  reported  from  postmarketing  experience  include  erythema 
multiforme, Stevens Johnson syndrome and cutaneous lupus erythematosus.” 
Serious  skin  reactions  are  included  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan  as  identified  risks  and  Stevens 
Johnson syndrome as potential risk requiring further evaluation. 
Laboratory findings 
In  the  pivotal  trials  1473-IMIQ  and  1487-IMIQ,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in 
haemoglobin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and platelet counts in the imiquimod 
group as compared with vehicle. This finding is already reflected in section 4.8 of the SPC as follows: 
“Reductions  in  haemoglobin,  white  blood  cell  count,  absolute  neutrophils  and  platelets  have  been 
observed in clinical trials.  These reductions are not considered to be clinically significant in patients 
with normal haematologic reserve.  Patients with reduced haematologic reserve have not been studied 
in clinical trials”.  
At CHMP’s request the MAH provided a review of haematology data (white blood cell count, absolute 
neutrophil, platelet and haemoglobin) from clinical trials (3800 imiquimod and 1170 vehicle patients) 
and postmarketing (56 spontaneous reports of haematologic events).  
Consequently,  the  following  information  is  added  to  the  product  information  in  line  with  CHMP’s 
recommendation: 
Section  4.8:  “Reductions  in  haematological  parameters  requiring  clinical  intervention  have  been 
reported from postmarketing experience.”  
Section 4.4: “Imiquimod should be used with caution in patients with reduced haematologic reserve.’ 
Additionally  reductions  in  haematological  parameters  requiring  clinical  intervention  are  included  in 
the  Risk  Management  Plan  and  CHMP  requested  that  the  MAH  should  commit  to  closely  monitor 
reports  alluding  to  immune  thrombocytopenia  and  provide  a  review  with  the  next  Periodic  Safety 
Update Report.  In addition, the MAH should provide an interpretation of haematological side effect, 
in order to be able to identify patients at risk for these side effects. 
In  conclusion  the  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reactions  to  imiquimod  are  application  site 
reactions,  but  systemic  reactions,  such  as  myalgia,  arthralgia,  fatigue,  anorexia,  depression  and 
reductions  in  haematological  parameters  have  also  been  reported.    These  systemic  reactions  may 
plausibly be explained by the action of cytokines induced by imiquimod. 
EU Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH has submitted a RMP upon CHMP request. The MAH has committed to revise the RMP in 
line with CHMP suggestions for improvement within 60 days of the CHMP’s final opinion. 
The  MAH  has  committed  to  perform  a  comparative  clinical  trial  with  a  three-year  follow-up  period 
within the timelines specified in the Risk Management Plan. The design of the trial should be subject 
to scientific advice (submission for CHMP scientific advice within 60 days of approval, final protocol 
within  12  weeks  of  obtaining  scientific  advice,  initiation  of  trial  by  Q3/2007,  final  study  report 
Q4/2011).

Overall discussion 
Actinic  keratoses  are  a  common  sun-induced  precancerous  lesions  confined  to  the  epidermis. 
Prevalence increases with advancing age. Lesions may regress spontaneously, with annual regression 
rates  of  approximately  25%.    On  the  other  hand,  actinic  keratoses  may  progress  to  squamous  cell 
carcinoma with a potential to metastasize estimated at around 3-6%.  The chance of any given lesion 
developing into a squamous cell carcinoma is unknown. Relative risks depend on factors related to the 
lesion itself (e.g. thickness) as well as individual patient characteristics.  Patients with actinic keratoses 
at  thermal  injuries  and  large  scars,  with  immunosuppression,  human  papilloma  virus  infection  and 
lesions on mucosal surfaces have an increased risk of malignant transformation. The primary rationale 
of treating actinic keratosis is the prevention of progression to squamous cell carcinoma.  
Treatment  options  for  actinic  keratosis  include  destructive  modalities  such  as  cryotherapy  and 
electrodessication and curettage, and topical treatments such as 5-fluorouracil, diclofenac and methyl-
5-aminolevulinate.    Despite  the  fact  that  the  primary  rationale  for  treating  actinic  keratosis  is  the 
prevention of progression to squamous cell carcinoma, there are no robust clinical trial data available 
for any of the topical treatments licensed in Europe in this “prevention indication”.  
On  the  basis  of  the  submitted  data,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  short-term  benefit  of  imiquimod  in 
clearing  of  visible  actinic  keratosis  lesions  in  immunocompetent  patients  has  been  established.    As 
there  are  no  data  to  establish  non-inferiority  to  other  treatments,  preferential  use  of  imiquimod  over 
other topical therapies would be unjustified.   
The  demonstrated  efficacy  of  imiquimod  is  limited  to  certain  types  of  lesions  (non-hyperkeratotic, 
non-hypertrophic) and locations (face and scalp) and appears to decrease with increasing numbers of 
lesions (1511-IMIQ). There are no data on efficacy in those patients with increased risk of malignant 
transformation  as  outlined  above  as  patients  with  immunosuppression  and  those  who  had  any 
dermatological  disease  or  condition  in  the  treatment  or  surrounding  area  that  might  have  caused 
difficulty with examination were excluded from the clinical trials.  Also, there are no data on actinic 
cheilitis. 
The  short-term  efficacy  of  imiquimod  in  clearing  actinic  keratosis  is  within  the  range  reported  in 
literature  for  other  topical  treatments  and  more  recent  data  for  cryotherapy,  but  there  are  no  data 
directly  comparing  the  efficacy  of  imiquimod  at  the  proposed  posology  with  any  established 
treatments for actinic keratosis, either short- or long-term. 
Given  that  the  benefit  in  the  prevention  of  progression  to  squamous  cell  carcinoma  has  not  been 
established  and  that  several  other  treatment  options  are  available,  the  (“absolute”  and  comparative) 
safety profile is of primary concern.  Although the data made available at various steps throughout the 
procedure have allayed the concern that imiquimod is associated with an excess rate of recurrence and 
progression  rates  at  one  year,  it  is  noted  that  only  a  subgroup  of  patients  were  followed  up  and  no 
assessment was made as to whether SCCs arose from previous lesions. Therefore the MAH commits 
to  conduct  a  long-term  comparative  trial  as  a  post-approval  commitment.  This  trial  is  to  include 
assessments  of  recurrence  and  progression  rates  and  time  to  recurrence  as  well  as  identified  and 
potential risks. 
Imiquimod  may  cause  a  variety  of  systemic  reactions  including  stimulation  or  exacerbation  of 
(auto)immune conditions, skin reactions resulting in hospitalisation and reductions in haematological 
parameters.  Although  the  number  of  cumulative  cases  of  such  events  is  low  in  the  context  of  the 
exposure  and  some  of  the  reported  cases  may  not  be  causally  associated  with  imiquimod  therapy, 
some demonstrate good temporal association with positive de-challenge and/or rechallenge.  
Given that the proposed patient population is likely to be elderly and suffer from concomitant diseases 
(e.g.  occult  carcinoma  with  reduced  haematologic  reserve)  that  may  make  them  more  vulnerable  to 
some  of  imiquimod’s  adverse  effects,  the  condition  to  be  treated  in  itself  is  not  malignant,  the 
established  benefit  is  limited  to  clearing  certain  types  of  actinic  keratosis  lesions,  and  treatment 
options  with  a  more  favourable  safety  profile  are  available,  CHMP  considered  that  the  indication 
should  be  restricted  to  immunocompetent  adult  patients  when  size  or  number  of  lesions  limit  the

efficacy and/or acceptability of cryotherapy and other topical treatment options are contraindicated

Changes to the product information 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
The CHMP requested the following amendments to the proposed SPC: 
“Therapeutic indications” 
Section 4.1 
“Imiquimod cream is indicated for the topical treatment of (…) clinically typical, nonhyperkeratotic, 
nonhypertrophic actinic keratoses (AKs) on the face or scalp in immunocompetent adult patients when 
size  or  number  of  lesions  limit  the  efficacy  and/or  acceptability  of  cryotherapy  and  other  topical 
treatment options are contraindicated or less appropriate.” 
“Posology and method of administration” 
Section 4.2 
Posology 
Actinic keratosis in adults 
“Treatment should be initiated and monitored by a physician. (…) Sufficient cream should be applied 
to  cover  the  treatment  area.    After  a  4-week  treatment-free  period,  clearance  of  AKs  should  be 
assessed.  If any lesions persist, treatment should be repeated for another four weeks. 
The maximum recommended dose is one sachet.  The maximum recommended treatment duration is 8 
weeks. 
An  interruption  of  dosing  should  be  considered  if  intense  local  inflammatory  reactions  occur  (see 
section  4.4)  or  if  infection  is  observed  at  the  treatment  site.  In  this  latter  case,  appropriate  other 
measures  should  be  taken.    Each  treatment  period  should  not  be  extended  beyond  4  weeks  due  to 
missed doses or rest periods. 
If the treated lesion(s) show an incomplete response at the follow-up examination at 4-8 weeks after 
the second treatment period, a different therapy should be used (see section 4.4).” 
“Special warnings and special precautions for use” 
Section 4.4 
Consequential  changes  have  also  been  introduced  in  the  sections  4.4  “Special  warnings  and 
precautions for use”. 
External genital warts, superficial basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis: 
“Imiquimod  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with  reduced  haematologic  reserve  (refer  to 
section 4.8d).” 
Actinic keratosis 
“Lesions  clinically  atypical  for  AKs  or  suspicious  for  malignancy  should  be  biopsied  to  determine 
appropriate treatment.” 
“There are very limited data available on the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses 
in anatomical locations other than the face and scalp. The available data on actinic keratosis on the 
forearms  and  hands  do  not  support  efficacy  in  this  indication  and  therefore  such  use  is  not 
recommended.” 
“Imiquimod  is  not  recommended  for  the  treatment  of  AKs  lesions  with  marked  hyperkeratosis  or 
hypertrophy as seen in cutaneous horns.” 
“No data are available on re-treating actinic keratoses that have cleared after one or two courses of 
treatment and subsequently recur, and any such use is therefore not recommended. 
Data from an open-label clinical trial suggest that subjects with more than 8 AKs lesions showed a 
decreased rate of complete clearance compared to patients with less than 8 lesions.”

“Undesirable effects” 
Section 4.8 
This section was updated to include the safety information derived from the clinical studies assessed. 
The revision takes into account the Adverse Events reported and their frequency. 
Frequently occurring adverse events: 
c) 
Actinic keratosis 
“In  clinical  trials  of  imiquimod  cream  3x  weekly  for  4  or  8  weeks  the  most  frequently  occurring 
application  site  reactions  were  itching  at  the  target  site  (14%)  and  burning  at  the  target  site  (5%).  
Severe erythema (24%) and severe scabbing and crusting (20%) were very common.” 
Adverse events applicable to all indications:  
d) 
Clinical studies investigating the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis have detected 
a  0.4%  (5/1214)  frequency  of  alopecia  at  the  treatment  site  or  surrounding  area.  Postmarketing 
reports of suspected alopecia occurring during the treatment of sBCC and EGW have been received. 
Reductions  in  haematological  parameters  requiring  clinical  intervention  have  been  reported  from 
postmarketing experience. 
Rare  cases  of  remote  site  dermatologic  drug  reactions,  including  erythema  multiforme,  have  been 
reported from clinical trials.  Serious skin reactions reported from postmarketing experience include 
erythema multiforme, Stevens Johnson syndrome and cutaneous lupus erythematosus. 
“Pharmacodynamic properties” 
Section 5.1  
The revision of the Section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties” of the SPC includes the description and 
the results of the studies assessed. 
Actinic keratosis: 
Clinical efficacy: 
The efficacy of imiquimod applied 3 times per week for one or two courses of 4 weeks, separated by a 
4  week  treatment-free  period,  was  studied  in  two  double-blind  vehicle  controlled  clinical  trials.  
Patients  had  clinically  typical,  visible,  discrete,  nonhyperkeratotic,  nonhypertrophic  AKs  lesions  on 
the balding scalp or face within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area.  4-8 AKs lesions were treated.  
The  complete  clearance  rate  (imiquimod  minus  placebo)  for  the  combined  trials  was  46.1%  (CI 
39.0%, 53.1%).   
One-year  data  from  two  combined  observational  studies  indicate  a  recurrence  rate  of  27%  (35/128 
patients)  in  those  patients  who  became  clinically  clear  after  one  or  two  courses  of  treatment.    The 
recurrence rate for individual lesions was 5.6% (41/737).  Corresponding recurrence rates for vehicle 
were  47%  (8/17  patients)  and  7.5%  (6/80  lesions).    The  rate  of  progression  to  squamous  cell 
carcinoma (SCC) was reported in 1.6% (2/128 patients). 
There are no data on recurrence and progression rates beyond 1 year. 
The  changes  in  the  Section  5.2  “Pharmacokinetic  properties”  of  the  SPC  reflect  the  addition  of  the  
new indication. 
Package leaflet 
Where  relevant,  above  changes  are  also  reflected  in  the  package  leaflet.  Additionally  the  package 
leaflet  has  been  amended  following  user  testing  results.  The  MAH  also  took  the  opportunity  of  this 
variation to amend the list of local representatives for Iceland, the Netherlands, and Estonia. 
Furthermore, the PI was updated in line with the QRD 7 template. Additionally the MAH corrected a 
number of errors in translation that have been identified in all language versions except Czech.

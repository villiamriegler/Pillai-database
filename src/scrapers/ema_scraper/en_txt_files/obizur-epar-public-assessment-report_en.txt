1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Baxalta Innovations GmbH submitted on 30 June 2014 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Obizur, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 19 July 2012. 
Obizur was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/10/784 on 20 September 2010. Obizur 
was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: Treatment of haemophilia 
A. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with acquired haemophilia A.  
OBIZUR is indicated in adults.  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that susoctocog alfa was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0040/2012 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request for consideration 
Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Marketing Authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 based on the following 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 5/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
claim: the applicant is unable to provide comprehensive clinical data on the efficacy and safety under 
normal conditions of use due to the rarity of the indication. 
The  applicant  justified  that  he  is  unable  to  provide  comprehensive  data  on  the  efficacy  and  safety 
under normal conditions of use, due to the fact that:  
•  Acquired Haemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder  
•  Due to the extremely limited subject availability, it was not feasible to identify and recruit the 
minimum  number  of  subjects  recommended  by  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  clinical 
investigation of recombinant Factor VIII and IX products for the first PK study. 
The  applicant  proposed  a  specific  obligation  in  relation  with  article  14(8)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 
726/2004  by  establishing  a  prospective  non-interventional  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and 
effectiveness  of  Obizur  in real-life  practice  (EU)  and  a  recombinant  porcine  sequence  FVIII  treatment 
registry (USA) 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance susoctocog alfa contained in the above medicinal product 
to be considered as a new active substance in itself, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent 
of a product previously authorised within the Union. 
Protocol Assistance 
The applicant received Protocol Assistance from the CHMP on 29 May 2009, 22 October 2009, 15 
December 2011 and 19 December 2013. The Protocol Assistance pertained to quality and clinical 
aspects of the dossier.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Acquired haemophilia is owing to the development of auto-antibodies directed against factor VIII: the 
resulting reduction in factor VIII activity is associated with a significant bleeding tendency. Bleeding 
may be spontaneous or in response to (often minimal) trauma. The classical form of haemophilia A is 
an x-linked (i.e. occurs in males) congenital bleeding tendency associated with a reduction in the factor 
VIII activity, where bleeding typically occurs into large joints. 
Acquired haemophilia occurs in about 2 per million of the population, in all ethnic groups and with 
worldwide prevalence and is typically a disorder of middle age, occuring equally in both sexes. The 
pattern of bleeding seen in acquired haemophilia is distinct from that seen in the more common 
congenital form. Bleeding most commonly occurs into skin and soft tissues. Cases may present with, 
for example, compartment syndrome, haematuria, gastrointestinal bleeding and prolonged post-
partum bleeding. The reported mortality rate is up to 20% (Kessler et al 2005).  
About half of cases have an associated condition such as malignancy, auto-immune disease, pregnancy 
or present as an adverse reaction to certain medicines. In other cases, the condition is labelled as 
idiopathic. Elderly patients may be prescribed medications that can exacerbate the bleeding tendency 
in acquired haemophilia through inhibition of platelet function e.g. aspirin for cardiac disease. 
The typical laboratory findings of acquired haemophilia are a prolonged activated partial 
thromboplastin time (APTT) and a low factor VIII. The thrombin and prothrombin times and the 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015

platelet count and function are typically normal. Mixing studies may be used to demonstrate the 
presence of a time-dependent inhibitor of factor VIII, as described in the World Federation of 
Haemophilia laboratory manual: Diagnosis of Haemophilia and Other Bleeding Disorder 
(http://www1.wfh.org/publications/files/pdf-1283.pdf). The antibodies in acquired haemophilia are 
invariably directed towards factor VIII and not factor IX. The antibodies are usually polyclonal IgG4 
antibodies (rarely IgM or IgA). Most antibodies bind to the 44-kD A2 domain and / or the 72-kD C2 
domain of factor VIII and do not fix complement. There is a poor correlation between the measureable 
factor VIII level and bleeding severity in acquired haemophilia (in distinction to congenital 
haemophilia). 
The objectives in treating patients with acquired haemophilia A are (i) to stop the acute bleed and (ii) 
to suppress inhibitor formation.  
Exogenous human factor VIII is likely to be very rapidly inactivated by a significant titre of inhibitory 
antibody and so may lack efficacy, even at high doses. By-passing agents (that circumvent the normal 
factor VIII-dependent coagulation cascade and hence the effect of factor VIII inhibitors) such as 
activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) or activated recombinant factor VII (rFVII) may be 
used. Laboratory tests are not informative and so response to treatment must be assessed on clinical 
grounds.  
There are published case reports of venous and arterial thrombosis associated with both by-passing 
agents. Exposure to activated prothrombin complex concentrate (which contains factor VIII) may lead 
to an increase in inhibitor titre of the recipient. 
Immunosuppressive therapies such as steroids and cyclophosphamide are effective in eradicating 
factor VIII inhibitors in up to 70% of cases (about 1 in 5 patients will display a recurrence of the 
autoantibody). 
Porcine clotting factor VIII (Hyate:C, purified from the plasma of pigs) was used to treat severe 
bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia and who have antibodies to human clotting factor -from 
1984 to 2004. Hyate:C was withdrawn due to concerns over exposure of human recipients to pig-
derived infectious agents. 
Obizur is a purified, recombinant, B-domain-deleted porcine factor VIII that is expressed by a 
genetically engineered baby hamster kidney cell line with a DNA construct coding for 1448 amino 
acids. The molecular weight of Obizur is approximately 175 kDa (based on the amino acid sequence). 
The rationale for Obizur is that it is sufficiently similar to human factor VIII to have haemostatic effect 
in humans yet sufficiently different so as to be less susceptible to inactivation by circulating antibodies. 
The Applicant applied for the following indication:  
“Treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with acquired haemophilia A.  
OBIZUR is indicated in adults.”  
The final indication approved by CHMP is: 
“Treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with acquired haemophilia caused by antibodies to Factor 
VIII. 
OBIZUR is indicated in adults.” 
The recommended initial dose is 200 U per kilogram bodyweight, given by intravenous injection.

Once bleeding has responded, usually within the first 24 hours, continue OBIZUR with a dose that 
maintains the trough FVIII activity at 30-40% until bleeding is controlled. The maximum blood FVIII 
activity must not exceed 200%. 
The clinical development programme is based on safety and efficacy data from 28 subjects with AHA 
treated with OBIZUR in the phase 2/3 open-label clinical study OBI-1-301/OBI-1-301a (CSR OBI-1-
301). The safety, haemostatic activity and pharmacokinetic profile of OBIZUR is supported by results 
of an open-label phase-2 study in patients with CHA with inhibitors (CSR OBI-1-201) and a randomized 
phase-1 study comparing OBIZUR with a plasma-derived porcine factor VIII (CSR OBI-1-101). 
Scientific advice 
General scientific advice on product development was given by the MHRA (UK) and MPE (SE) in 
October 2008, by the CHMP in May 2009 and by MEB (NL) in July 2009.  
Protocol assistance was given by the CHMP in December 2011 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/945059/2011) in 
which the company was advised to collect ‘relatively dense pharmacokinetic profiles in individual 
subjects’ and that, owing to the rarity of acquired haemophilia A, the ‘concept of a single-arm, open 
label study in a limited number of patients’ is agreed. 24hrs as the selected time for the primary 
efficacy endpoint was accepted. Regarding the use of the one stage coagulation assay for assigning 
potency, the Applicant was advised that since the chromogenic assay is not mandatory, the choice of 
assay should be supported by scientific data. 
Follow-up protocol assistance was given by the CHMP in December 2013 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/749449/2013) in which the company was advised to submit an application on the 
basis of 29 planned patients (to include 4 patients treated under an expanded access programme). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Susoctocog alfa (Recombinant Porcine Factor VIII, B-Domain Deleted) is a purified glycoprotein 
produced in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells by recombinant DNA technology. Obizur is available as 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 9/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
powder in single-use vials containing 500 units (nominal) of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII; 
recombinant) per vial. One unit of susoctocog alfa is equivalent to the potency of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma. The finished product is a kit, which includes the drug product vial, the 1 ml 
pre-filled WFI syringe for reconstitution and the individual syringe vial adapter. The vial adapter 
consists of a 15 μm in-line filter and the puncture of the rubber stopper is achieved by means of the 
integral plastic spike.  
Obizur is for intravenous use after reconstitution with water for injection (WFI). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The molecular weight of Obizur (susoctocog alfa) is approximately 175 kDa (based on the amino acid 
sequence). 
Susoctocog  alfa  is  a  heterodimer  consisting  of  a  heavy  chain  and  light  chain  held  together  through 
non-covalent interactions consisting of approximately 1448 amino acids. Full length human and porcine 
factor  VIII  are  composed of  the  domain  structure  A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2.  In  susoctocog  alfa,  the  porcine 
factor VIII B-domain, which is not known to be necessary for procoagulant activity, has been replaced 
with  a  twenty-four  amino  acid  linker  containing  amino  acids  of  the  B  domain  adjacent  to  the  C 
terminus of the heavy chain and amino acids of the B-domain adjacent to the N terminus of the light 
chain.  Thus,  the  naturally  occurring  cleavage  sites  for  the  B-domain  of  factor  VIII  have  been 
incorporated into the susoctocog alfa molecular construct. The susoctocog alfa structure also includes 
the  original  activation  sequence  of  the  molecule  within  the  light  chain,  including  a  40  amino  acid 
activation peptide. The primary susoctocog alfa molecule contains intramolecular disulfide bonds, free 
sulfhydryls, sulfated tyrosine residues, and N-linked and O-linked glycosylation sites. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturer 
Information on the manufacturing sites and their responsibilities was provided. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Susoctocog alfa drug substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. Main steps are 
fermentation, recovery, purification and steps for virus inactivation and virus removal.  
Briefly, the manufacturing of susoctocog alfa FBDS (Final Bulk Drug Substance) utilizes a roller bottle 
cell culture process for cell expansion and recombinant protein expression followed by a series of 
filtration and chromatographic steps to purify the product from process related impurities. The active 
substance manufacturing process includes as well two orthogonal viral removal/inactivation steps for 
clearance of potential virus particles.  
A batch of FBDS is defined as deriving from a single vial of Working Cell Bank (WCB).  
Control of materials 
Information on compendial and non-compendial raw materials used in the active substance 
manufacturing process has been submitted.  
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 10/82 
 
 
 
 
 
The origin and the description of the coding sequences for the B-domain deleted porcine factor VIII 
construct as well as the cloning strategy for the expression construct were described. 
The Applicant is using a concept of two-tiered cell banking system that consists of MCB and WCB. The 
source, history and manufacture of the BHK cells, MCB and WCB have been described and documented 
in detail according to ICHQ5B. Both MCB and WCB have been qualified and characterised by extensive 
testing for specified parameters. However, it is recommended that the Applicant further evaluates and 
thereby confirms the genetic stability of the BHK cells (see 2.2.6). 
The establishment of a new WCB was described and the protocol to establish a new WCB can be 
accepted.  
The storage and stability of the cell banks was established according to the ICH Q5D guideline. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The application is not a QbD application, but a large number of critical steps were defined together 
with process parameters, in-process limits and consequences when these are out of range. While the 
list of critical steps was largely agreed with and accepted, a number of other concerns were raised with 
regard to the control of critical steps. These were resolved by the Applicant with the responses 
submitted. For non-conformance, the batch will be terminated unless there is a technical justification, 
supported by adequate validation.  If the non-conformance batch is to be released, the review of the 
non-conformance will entail sufficient rigor to ensure that the quality of the product is unaffected. 
Process validation 
The active substance manufacturing process was validated conventionally. The results from these 
validation batches are deemed to be consistent.  
Manufacturing process development 
The development of the FBDS manufacturing process was carried out at two manufacturing sites. 
Changes to manufacturing processes, analytical methods and reference standards have occurred 
during the development. With the LoQ D120 the applicant was requested to provide a clear overview of 
the changes, including an impact analysis of their criticality and a clarification how comparability of 
different batches used in clinical trials has been ensured, if critical/major changes have taken place. 
Subsequently, summaries of changes in cell culture and purification process development were 
provided as well as a summary of changes in analytical methods.  
The changes in reference standard were described as requested. According to the Applicant the only 
major changes which resulted in an effect on the potency testing results were associated with two 
reference standard lot numbers which were calibrated against the WHO 7th or WHO 8th International 
Standard. These effects were mitigated by implementation of a correction factor for the purposes of 
data comparison during stability. In addition, the Obizur product specifications were re-evaluated via 
change control to account for the known differences.  
A more thorough table of summary of comparability data across manufacturing process phases for 
FBDS and FDP was presented in the response package. The analytical results of the batches supporting 
clinical studies of Obizur showed that the Obizur FBDS or FDP can be considered comparable 
throughout the phases with improved purity of the material produced in support of Phase 3 clinical 
studies.  
Characterisation 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 11/82 
 
 
 
 
Extensive characterisation of the rFVIII has been carried out including the molecular structure as well 
as process and product related impurities. The porcine derived FVIII coagulation factor has been shown 
having a similar biological effect as human factor VIII.  
Specification 
After revision during the evaluation procedure, the active substance specifications were considered 
adequately set and justified.  
The specification for impurity was originally thought to be set too wide which allowed a high amount of 
this impurity per dose in the product. With the response to the D120 LoQ the applicant justified these 
higher limits by referring to the variability in the amount of the impurity in clinical trial batches. 
However, the current high levels of porcine rFVIII proposed to be dosed (200 U/Kg) may mean that a 
relatively high level of the impurity could be given to a patient with very low levels of circulating 
porcine rFVIII.  Results from validation batches with substantially less content of this impurity than the 
mean obtained for the clinical batches indicate the possibility to produce batches with lower impurity 
content. The applicant has tightened the limits of this impurity and committed to review the impurity 
specifications once more process experience is gained (see 2.2.6). 
Analytical methods 
The FBDS is tested using a combination of compendial and non-compendial methods. The methods 
applied, their validation and their acceptance ranges were presented in the dossier. 
Information on the potency assay is included in the Finished Product section under the heading 
Analytical methods (see below). 
Reference materials 
There is a comprehensive reference standard program and qualification in place for reference 
standards used within Obizur analyses. There is no international reference standard available for 
recombinant porcine factor VIII. Therefore, Obizur is labelled in units.  
The primary reference standards were prepared from Obizur drug substance or drug product, 
depending on the reference standard use. Each in-house reference standard is qualified for use by 
meeting release test, comparison with previous reference standard, and through additional 
characterisation. The reference materials used by the applicant have been well characterised using 
additional analysis that is used for batch release.  
Stability 
The Applicant has studied the stability of the active substance properly according to ICH Q5C. The 
proposed FBDS shelf-life is approvable.  
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
Reference is made to manufacturing process development. 
New Active Substance Status 
The active substance susoctocog alfa, a recombinant antihaemophilic factor VIII, porcine sequence, B-
domain deleted is produced in Baby Hamster Kidney cells. From 1984 to 2004, a plasma-derived 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 12/82 
 
 
 
 
porcine factor VIII product was licensed under the name of Hyate C. Susoctocog alfa, as recombinant 
product, was developed as an improvement in safety to this product. 
Susoctocog alfa is a biological active substance not previously authorised as a medicinal product in the 
European Union. There is no essentially similar medicinal product authorised in the community or has 
previously been authorized as a medicinal product which is comparable in the manufacturing and 
safety of susoctocog alfa. 
Based on the review of the data CHMP considered that the active substance susoctocog alfa contained 
in the medicinal product Obizur is to be qualified as a new active substance in itself.

commercial supply.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturer  
Information on manufacturers and their responsibilities was provided.  
Description of manufacturing process, process controls and validation 
The drug product (DP) manufacturing process has been sufficiently described. The batch formula has 
been presented.  
The DP manufacturing process flow chart has been submitted. The Applicant has defined critical 
process steps and implemented critical control parameters and acceptance criteria which are 
considered reasonable. Regarding the control strategy the same concerns were raised as for the 
manufacturing process for the active substance and subsequently resolved by the Applicant (see 
above).   
The process was validated conventionally with commercial batches. The validation results were 
consistent showing that the manufacturing process is well controlled. 
Control of excipients 
Most of the excipients are compendial and the quality is controlled according to the corresponding 
monographs.  
Product specification 
Overall, the drug product specifications are considered adequately set and justified.  
Analytical methods 
Analytical methods were described and validated.  
The applicant investigated two methods for potency determination: the one stage coagulation assay 
(OSCA) and the chromogenic assay (CA). The use of the OSCA for potency labelling was considered 
acceptable based on the justification provided by the applicant and this would be in agreement with 
previous CHMP scientific advice. It is noted that the Ph. Eur monograph method for human rFVIII 
requires the use of the chromogenic rather than the OSCA, however, there is no requirement for 
porcine rFVIII. 
The applicant investigated the effect of different commercially available aPPT reagents on the potency 
of Obizur reference standards in the OSCA (aPPT reagent with SiO2 activator and aPPT reagent with 
ellagic acid as activator). The potency results showed that the aPPT reagent with the SiO2 activator 
were lower than those obtained with the aPPT reagent with ellagic acid activator. Subsequently the 
applicant initiated a collaborative field study assessing the variability of Factor VIII activity assays for 
analysis of Obizur. 34 clinical and haemostasis laboratories measured the FVIII activity of Obizur at 3 
different concentrations using OSCA assays with a variety of aPTT reagents, where 25 laboratories 
used SiO2 and 9 laboratories used ellagic acid as activator. Results showed that all laboratories 
produced similar results for Obizur within the 80-120% variability of the stated sample potency.

Stability of the product 
Stability data support the shelf life claim in the SmPC. The proposed shelf life at 2-8 °C with light 
protection and storage after reconstitution at ambient temperature and light conditions is considered 
approvable. 
Comparability exercise for finished medicinal drug product 
There were few changes in one step of the drug product manufacturing process. Results showed that 
the pre- and post-change batches were comparable. 
Adventitious agents 
The  Applicant  has  addressed  both  non-viral  and  viral  contaminants.  Overall  the  risk  of  TSE  can  be 
considered negligible.  
The  BHK  cell  line  used  for  the  production  was  well  characterised.  MCB,  WCB  and  EPC  have  been 
characterised for the absence of contaminating viruses according to ICHQ5A.  
A  virus  validation  study  was  performed  according  to  CPMP/BWP/268/95.  The  capability  of  process 
steps  to  reduce  adventitious  viruses  has  been  adequately  demonstrated  using  model  viruses.  The 
viruses  for  the  clearance  studies  can  be  considered  to  represent  a  wide  range  of  physico-chemical 
properties  that  demonstrate  the  ability  of  the  system  to  eliminate  the  viruses  in  general.  The  viral 
clearance validation was considered acceptable.

Finished product – Solvent (Water for Injections) 
The solvent is sterile Water for Injections (WfI) according to Ph. Eur., USP-NF, Ph. J. The WfI pre-filled 
syringes are manufactured and tested for compliance with the appropriate specifications.  
The description of the WfI manufacturing process, in-process controls, validation data and specification 
are considered adequate. The stability studies were performed according to the ICH Q1A guideline. The 
claimed shelf-life for the sWFI pre-filled syringes when stored at 2°C to 30°C was confirmed with the 
stability data obtained.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In general, information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in an acceptable manner. A number of other concerns were raised during 
the evaluation procedure which were satisfactorily resolved by the applicant with some points 
recommended for further development (see 2.2.6)  
Overall, the data provided on the manufacturing and control of the active substance and finished 
product indicate consistency and uniformity of product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
Appropriate measures to ensure TSE and viral safety of the product are in place.  Therefore, the risk of 
contamination with TSE or viral agents is considered negligible. 
Based on the review of the data CHMP considered that the active substance susoctocog alfa contained 
in the medicinal product Obizur is to be qualified as a new active substance in itself. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Obizur is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  It is recommended that the Applicant further evaluates and confirms the genetic stability of 
BHK cells.  
2.  In view of the high dosing regimen, it is recommended that the Applicant follows the amount of 
one impurity in future batches. The specifications should be reviewed according to the gained 
experience. If the manufacturing experience produces batches with low levels of this impurity, 
no further action by the company will be required.  If the future batches produced show the 
same range of variability of the impurity that was seen in the clinical trial batches the company 
should consider investigating the source of this variability and adopt appropriate steps to 
reduce the variability in the levels of this impurity.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Obizur is a B-domain deleted form of porcine factor VIII and is manufactured in a baby hamster kidney 
(BHK) derived cell line.  
Primary pharmacodynamics studies comprised of in vitro binding to von Willebrand Factor and 
biological activity by chromogenic assay and in vivo testing in dog and mouse models. The 
pharmacokinetics of Obizur was investigated in the haemophilia A dog and cynomolgus monkey. The 
toxicology program included assessment of single dose toxicity in haemophilia A dogs and in the 
cynomolgus monkey, 28-days and 90-days repeat dose toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys, as well as two 
immunogenicity studies in haemophilic mice and in cynomolgus monkeys. The repeat dose toxicity 
studies were conducted in compliance with the GLP regulations. The single dose toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys and the immunogenicity study were conducted under GLP, however no QA 
auditing of the laboratory analyses took place. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The in vitro functional characterisation studies for the Obizur molecule included an assessment of the 
kinetics of activation by thrombin and the binding affinity of Obizur to von Willebrand factor (vWF), as 
well as biological activity as determined by the chromogenic assay and one-stage coagulation assay. 
These studies are briefly outlined in this report and discussed in detail in the Quality section. 
In vitro 
Binding to von Willebrand Factor  
In order to assess the interaction of Obizur with vWF, Obizur was incubated with vWF to generate bi-
molecular complexes. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to separate bound complex from 
unbound Obizur and vWF, based on differences in molecular size. A titration technique using ratios of 
increasing amounts of OBI-1 to a fixed concentration of vWF was also employed. Using this titration 
technique, the profile of Obizur /vWF complex formation was determined from the SEC 
chromatograms. The data obtained supported the conclusion of published data (Lollar, 1987) that the 
stoichiometry of binding between Obizur with vWF was approximately 1:1 mole equivalent. This 1:1 
stoichiometric ratio was observed for both the Obizur drug product (DP) and final batch drug substance 
(FBDS) batches tested. 
Biological Activity by Chromogenic Assay:  
The chromogenic assay (CA) for determining the potency of factor VIII is based on the indirect 
measure of the role of factor VIII in the activation of factor X. The chromogenic assay is the method 
used in the European Pharmacopoeia to measure human FVIII potency. 
The rate of the conversion of factor X to factor Xa was measured as a change in optical density (OD) at 
405 nm, resulting from the activated factor Xa converting a substrate releasing a coloured product (p-
nitroaniline). Thus the OD at 405 nm was directly proportional to the amount of factor VIII activity in 
the sample. 
The results of this assessment for 2 batches of Obizur DP and 2 batches of Obizur DS showed that 
Obizur was capable of reacting with thrombin and Factor IXa to catalyse the activation of Factor X. The 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 17/82 
 
 
 
 
Obizur batches of FBDS tested demonstrated comparable Factor X activation near the target FBDS 
potency of 1100U/mL, as did Obizur batches of DP near the target DP potency of 500 U/mL. 
Biological Activity by the One-Stage Coagulation Assay: 
The one-stage coagulation assay (OSCA), used for determining the potency of Obizur, was based on its 
ability to shorten the prolonged coagulation time of factor VIII deficient plasma. 
Obizur was first activated by thrombin, and then together with factor IXa activates factor X (to factor 
Xa) in the presence of calcium ions and phospholipids, thereby initiating the coagulation cascade 
(similar to the intrinsic pathway in the natural coagulation cascade). Factor Xa is then available to 
catalyse prothrombin to thrombin at a rate that is proportional to the Obizur activity in the sample. The 
coagulation was monitored at 660 nm as a function of turbidity. The time required to reach the total 
change in light intensity was defined as the coagulation time, and was proportional to the level of 
Obizur present in the sample tested. 
The data obtained demonstrated the ability of Obizur to be activated by thrombin and react with Factor 
IXa to initiate the coagulation cascade, leading to clotting in Factor VIII-deficient plasma. The Obizur 
batches of formulated bulk drug substance tested demonstrated comparable clotting activity near the 
target potency of 1000 U/mL, as did Obizur batches of drug product near the target potency of 500 
U/mL. 
In vivo 
Efficacy of Obizur in a Knock-out Mouse Haemophilia A Model  
A study was conducted to determine the comparative efficacy of recombinant B-chain deleted porcine 
factor VIII (Obizur; Lot 214-01-001) and Hyate:C, a plasma-derived porcine factor VIII (previously 
marketed in the US but commercial production discontinued in 2004). 
Male and female haemophilia A mice (strain E 16 mice), produced by targeted disruption of exon 16 in 
the factor VIII gene and backcrossed into a C57BL/6 background (Bi, 1995), were used to evaluate the 
efficacy of Obizur compared to Hyate:C (PCMU-101A). Survival/mortality at 24 hour following tail 
transection was the efficacy parameter monitored. 
The ED50 values determined were 89 U/kg and 64 U/kg for Obizur and Hyate:C, respectively. The 
difference in results was not statistically significant. 
Acute blood loss was found to equal body weight loss. At the time of death, untreated haemophilia A 
mice lost 5.0% of their initial body weight. Surviving mice treated with Obizur or Hyate:C or normal 
mice lost 2.9%, 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively, of their body weight at 2 hours which was significantly 
less than in the control hemophilia A mouse group. 
Efficacy of Obizur in the Haemophilia A Dog Model  
Other studies were conducted in a canine model of haemophilia A in which dogs had no circulating 
factor VIII activity (PCD-101). The dogs (n=2 to 4) were administered a single injection of either 3, 
25, and 100 U/kg Obizur or Hyate:C in a cross over design with the subsequent injection of the other 
product approximately four days later. Animals were observed for adverse effects. Blood samples were 
taken at intervals up to 72 hours post dose and analysed for blood count (including platelet count), 
partial thromboplastin times, prothrombin times, clottable fibrinogen levels and fibrin degradation 
products. In the cuticle bleeding time (CBT) test, the cut cuticles of anaesthetised dogs were observed 
for up to 12 minutes and the CBT determined.

Page 18/82 
 
 
 
 
No adverse effects or behaviour were observed during the study. There were no significant changes in 
heart rate, respiratory rate or body temperature. Apart from a positive test for fibrin degradation 
products in a single dog, no haematologic toxicity was documented during the study 
Obizur (3 to 100 U/kg) was effective at decreasing the CBT in seven of the nine evaluations. Obizur 
appeared to be more effective in correcting the bleeding tendency than Hyate:C. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No specific secondary pharmacodynamic studies were conducted. Any secondary pharmacodynamic 
effects were assessed as part of the pharmacology and toxicology studies. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology of Obizur was assessed as part of the pharmacology and toxicology studies in 
the haemophilia A dog and the cynomolgus monkey. 
Respiratory and cardiovascular 
Heart rate and respiratory rate were assessed in haemophilia A dogs (n=6/sex/group) (PCD-101). No 
adverse effects were observed following intravenous injection of Obizur at doses of 3, 25 and 100 
U/kg. 
In a repeat dose toxicity study (PCM-101), cynomolgus monkeys (n=1/sex/group) were intravenously 
administered 100, 300, 600 and 1000 U/kg Obizur daily for 28 days with dose increases every 7 days. 
Body temperature, respiratory rate and blood pressure were measured at intervals up to Day 22 prior 
to dosing and at 1 and 4 hours post dose.  
No significant changes in body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure were 
observed in treated animals (in all dose groups) as compared to baseline. 
In a repeat dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys (n=6/sex/group) intravenously administered 
daily doses of 75, 225 and 750 U/kg (corresponding to actual doses of 82.5, 247.5 and 825 U/kg) or 
Hyate:C at 100 U/kg for 90 days, electrocardiograms (EGGs) were recorded from all animals pre-study 
and prior to dosing on Days 7, 28 and 90 (PCM-102).  
No changes in the electrocardiographic evaluations were observed in the monkeys in all dose groups.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The Applicant states that no studies on pharmacodynamic drug interaction were conducted because 
Obizur is applied as a monotherapy.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
The one stage clotting assay and/or the chromogenic assay were used to determine factor VIII activity 
in the experimental animals. Prior to the initiation of the study in the haemophilia A dog, performance 
and reproducibility of the one stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay were evaluated (PCD-
101). The reference curves against which the test factor VIII levels were measured were either 
Hyate:C or Obizur for the quantitation of Hyate:C and Obizur, respectively. The Obizur and the 
Hyate:C reference material were measured against a plasma reference for factor VIII. These studies 
showed a value of 1.03 U/mL for Obizur and 0.96 U/mL for Hyate:C. 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 19/82 
 
 
 
 
 
Values for factor VIII activity were higher for Obizur compared to Hyate:C at all doses and with both 
assays. The variability was generally lower when using the chromogenic assay (see Table 1). In the 
cynomolgus monkey (PCM-104, PCM-105) plasma concentrations of factor VIII were measured using 
the chromogenic assay. Plasma concentration of factor VIII in the 90 day toxicology study in the 
cynomolgus monkey was assessed using an one-stage clotting assay and a chromogenic assay (PCM-
102). 
Table 8. Assay Reproducibility with the One Stage Clotting Assays and Chromogenic Assay 
Absorption  
A study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of Obizur and Hyate:C, in dogs with severe 
haemophilia A, following a single intravenous injection (PCD-101, 08/PKR/019).  
Haemophilia A dogs (n=2 to 4) were administered Obizur or Hyate:C at three dose levels (3, 25 and 
100 U/kg). Each dog was randomised to receive either Obizur first, followed by Hyate:C, or Hyate:C 
first followed by Obizur, within the respective dose level. Blood samples were collected before dosing 
and at intervals up to 72 hours post dose and analysed for factor VIII. A non-compartmental 
pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma factor VIII levels was performed individually for each dog. Plasma 
concentrations of factor VIII were corrected by subtracting the baseline factor VIII levels. 
Plasma factor VIII values for Obizur were consistently higher than those obtained with equivalent 
doses of Hyate:C when measured either by the one stage clotting assay or the chromogenic assay. 
Considerable inter-animal variances in factor VIII values were noted at each of the three factor VIII 
doses. 
Due to the small sample size, no statistical comparisons between pharmacokinetic parameters of 
Obizur and Hyate:C were performed. The AUC0-t of both Obizur and Hyate:C increased with dose in a 
subproportional manner. Exposure to Obizur appeared higher than that to Hyate:C. The plasma CL and 
Vdss were lower for Obizur than for Hyate:C. No relevant differences were found between the half-lives 
of both compounds.

A study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of Obizur and Hyate:C, in the cynomolgus 
monkey following a single dose administration (PCM-104, 08/PKR/018). Experimentally non-naive 
cynomolgus monkeys were intravenously administered Obizur (49.5 or 77 U/kg) or Hyate:C (100 
U/kg) (n=4 males/group). Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at 24 hours post-dose and 
analysed for factor VIII using a chromogenic assay. Plasma concentrations of factor VIII were 
corrected for baseline by subtracting that level from all subsequent samples. For the determination of 
pharmacokinetic parameters a non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma factor VIII 
levels was performed. 
The plasma clearance of factor VIII following the intravenous administration of Obizur at dose levels of 
49.5 and 77 U/kg (0.056 and 0.085 dL/h/kg) were lower than after intravenous administration of 
Hyate:C at dose level of 100 U/kg (0.107 and 1.09 dL/h/kg). Consequently the systemic exposure of 
Obizur after intravenous administration (944 and 1443 h·U/dL) at dose levels of 49.5 and 77 U/kg was 
higher than that obtained after administration of 100 U/kg Hyate:C (91.8 and 934·h·U/dL). Mean

plasma levels of factor VIII were comparable for the two doses of Obizur (see Table 11). Plasma levels 
of factor VIII were higher after administration of Obizur than after dosing with Hyate:C. This was 
attributed to the lower clearance of Obizur. Levels of Obizur remained above the basal values for 24 
hours post dose.

No distribution studies have been performed with Obizur. The applicant stated that the volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vdss) values obtained from the absorption studies conducted in dogs and 
monkeys were comparable and approximate the blood volume/kg. Although no distribution study was 
conducted, the majority of Obizur administered was considered to be present in the circulating blood 
without distributing to other tissues or organs.

No excretion studies have been submitted.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

Other pharmacokinetic studies 
No other pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with Obizur. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology studies for Obizur included single dose toxicity studies in haemophilia A dogs and 
cynomolgus monkeys and repeat dose toxicity studies (up to 90 days) in cynomolgus monkeys. The 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015

90-day repeat dose toxicity study was conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice (GLP) 
regulations. Hyate:C was used as a comparator. Pharmaco- and toxicokinetics were assessed in the 
single dose and 90-day repeat dose toxicity study. Local tolerance was assessed as part of repeat dose 
toxicity studies. Immunogenicity was evaluated in haemophilia A mice and cynomolgus monkeys. 
Single dose toxicity 
Dog 
A study was conducted to compare the haemostatic efficacy, pharmacokinetics and tolerability of 
Obizur and Hyate:C, in a canine model of severe haemophilia administered a single intravenous 
injection (PCD-101). In a cross-over single dose study, Obizur and Hyate:C ( at 3, 25 or 100 U/kg) 
were administered to dogs (n=6/sex/group) with congenital haemophilia. 
General behaviour, heart rates, respiratory rates, body temperature and body weight were monitored 
post dose. The highest dose of 100 U/kg tested in this study corresponded to four times the minimal 
effective dose (25 U/kg) in this species. 
No adverse effects or changes were detected in any of the parameters measured in any of the animals 
treated with up to 100 U/kg of either Obizur or Hyate:C. 
Monkey 
A study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of Obizur and Hyate:C in 
cynomolgus monkeys (PCM-104). Animals (n=4 males/group) were intravenously administered Obizur 
(49.5 or 77 U/kg) or Hyate:C (100 U/kg). The animals were observed for clinical signs, food 
consumption and body weight. 
There were no clinical observations or changes in food consumption related to the administration of 
Obizur. One animal in the Hyate:C treatment group was reported to have had an allergic reaction and 
died. Following necropsy, the cause of this mortality remained inconclusive. 
Repeat dose toxicity  
28 day toxicity study: A study was conducted to determine the tolerability and potential 
immunogenicity of ascending doses of Obizur in cynomolgus monkeys when administered as once daily 
intravenous injections.  
Two cynomolgus monkeys (1 male, 1 female) received daily intravenous injections (in the saphenous 
or cephalic veins) of Obizur for 28 days with dose levels increasing every seven days. Doses were 
increased from 100 to 300, 600 and 1000 U/kg. 
Animals were observed for changes in clinical signs (including injection site observations), body weight 
and vital signs. Body weights were measured prior to the first dose (Day -1) and on Days 7, 14, 21 
and 28. Vital signs were measured in the temporarily restrained non sedated animals. Measurements 
also included body temperature (rectal), respiratory rate, heart rate and blood pressure. 
Blood samples for neutralising inhibitor antibody analysis were collected prior to dosing on Days 1, 8, 
15, 22 and also on Day 29. The titer of factor VIII inhibitory antibodies was measured.  
The Bethesda assay was not considered an accurate test for measuring the titer of factor VIII 
inhibitory antibodies due to the presence of circulating factor VIII levels. Therefore the factor VIII 
inhibitor antibody activity was determined using a mixing test. In this test a 1:1 mixture of the test 
plasma and porcine factor VIII product (Obizur) are incubated for 90 minutes and the residual activity 
of the mixture determined. Factor VIII activity was measured by the one stage clotting assay and the 
chromogenic assay.

Both animals survived the duration of the study. There were no clinical signs indicative of an adverse 
effect associated with the administration of Obizur. Slight bruising at injection sites was observed. The 
right cephalic injection site of the female animal was slightly swollen on Day 3 and had a slight sore 
during Days 12-13 and 15-16. No signs of inflammation were observed at the injection sites. There 
were no treatment-related changes in body weight and no effects on body temperature, respiration 
rate, blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were observed. 
The monkeys developed inhibitor antibodies to factor VIII after 14 days of dosing with Obizur at 100 
and 300 U/kg. 
90 day toxicity study: A study was conducted to determine the potential toxicity and immunogenicity 
of Obizur when administered by daily intravenous injection to cynomolgus monkeys for up to 90 days, 
compared to animals treated with Hyate:C (PCM-102). 
Monkeys (6/sex/group) were intravenously administered 75, 225 and 750 U/kg Obizur (actual doses of 
82.5, 247.5 and 825 U/kg) or 100 U/kg Hyate:C for up to 90 days and evaluated for changes in clinical 
signs and body weight. Electrocardiogram measurements were also taken (baseline, and prior to 
dosing on Days 1, 7, 28 and 90). Ophthalmic examinations were conducted prior to the study and at 
intervals up to Week 12. 
Blood samples were taken pre-study and prior to the initiation of dosing on Days 7, 28, 56 and 90 and 
haematological parameters (serum chemistry, haematology, coagulation parameters) were evaluated.  
In addition, blood samples were collected for toxicokinetic analysis prior to dosing and 1 and 6 hours 
post-dose on Days 1, 7, 28 and 90. Blood samples were also collected on Days 1, 7, 28 and 90 and 
analysed for factor VIII activities using stage clotting and chromogenic assays. Blood samples for 
neutralising inhibitor antibody analysis were collected prior to dosing on Days 1, 7, 28 and 90. A 
mixing study was used to measure levels of factor VIII inhibitory antibodies. Some animals were killed 
and necropsied on Days 8, 29 and 91. Urinalysis was conducted on samples collected by bladder 
aspiration at necropsy.  
There were no changes in body weight, serum chemistry, electrocardiographic abnormalities or 
ophthalmic findings that were associated with the test or control articles. 
Clinical signs observed were limited to intra-articular and soft tissue haemorrhages in four monkeys 
treated with Obizur, two monkeys dosed at 82.5 U/kg, one at the dose of 247.5 U/kg) and one at the 
dose of 825 U/kg. The findings of haemorrhage/haematoma at necropsy which coincided with 
haematology findings (decreases in the circulating red cell mass) and/or coagulation parameters 
changes (slight prolongation of aPTT from Day 28) in these animals were suggestive of bleeding in the 
tissues and/or an intra-articular bleed in one of the small joints of the foot. The Applicant stated that 
these non-dose-related clinical signs were not unexpected findings since the repeat injection of a 
porcine factor VIII recombinant such as OB1-1 in primates induced the production of anti-factor VIII 
antibodies, which can increase the risk of bleeding. 
A dose-related decrease in aPTT values was observed in all animals that received Obizur or Hyate:C on 
Day 7. However, aPTT was prolonged by Day 28 in all Obizur and Hyate:C treatment groups.  
An increase in factor VIII levels was seen at Days 1 and 7 one hour post-dose. On Day 7 baseline 
values for factor VIII were higher than on Day 1 for Obizur and Hyate:C treated animals, 
demonstrating an accumulating blood level of factor VIII. By Day 28 and Day 90, plasma factor VIII 
levels were markedly reduced in all monkeys (treated with either Obizur or Hyate:C) due to the 
development of anti-porcine factor VIII inhibitor antibodies which cross reacted with the monkey’s 
endogenous factor VIII (and in some cases as described above induced an “acquired haemophilia”

condition). A summary of inhibitor antibody findings is shown in Table 12. However, the values were 
not included in the final report of the study but presented as additional supportive data only. 
Table 12. Inhibitor Antibody Bethesda titer (BU) generated against Factor VIII Product 
Administered in Cynomolgus Monkeys Treated Daily (OSCA) 
The inhibitor antibody titer generated in the Obizur -treated monkeys was equivalent to that observed 
in those monkeys treated with Hyate:C. This showed comparable reactivity of the neutralising inhibitor 
antibodies against Obizur and Hyate:C. These results are summarised in Table 13. 
Table 13. Obizur 82.5U/kg-Treated Cynomolgus Monkeys: Inhibitor Antibody Bethesda Titer 
(BU) against Obizur and Cross-Reactive against Hyate:C (OSCA) 
Relative and absolute spleen weight were increased in the Hyate:C treatment group on Days 8, 29 and 
91. This increase in spleen weight was consistent with the splenic lymphoid hyperplasia observed in 
the histopathology evaluation and was attributed to an Hyate:C associated immune response. 
Glomerulopathy was found in both Obizur and Hyate:C treated animals. The incidence and severity of 
this finding tended to increase over time. The detection of anti-factor VIII antibodies in Obizur and 
Hyate:C supported the immunological basis (immune complex deposition) for the glomerulopathy. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been performed. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been submitted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been performed with Obizur.  
Toxicokinetic data 
An evaluation of plasma levels of factor VIII was conducted as part of a comparative immunogenicity 
toxicity conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (PCM-105, 08/PKR/017).   
Male and female monkeys were administered eight intravenous injections, one injection every twelve 
hours for 4 days. Obizur was administered at dose levels of 40 and 100 U/kg; Hyate:C at a dose level

Obizur 
Page 25/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of 100 U/kg. Blood samples were taken prior to and up to 12 hours post injection and analysed for 
factor VIII using a chromogenic assay. 
After intravenous administration of Obizur at dose levels of 40 and 100 U/kg and Hyate:C at dose 
levels of 100 U/kg, drug plasma levels were detectable until 12 hours post injection in all monkeys 
evaluated on Days 1 and 24. 
Both Day 1 and Day 4 plasma levels of Obizur were greater than those of Hyate:C at equivalent doses. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters estimated at Day 4 when steady state was reached are summarised 
in Table 7.  
The plasma clearance at steady state of factor VIII after repeated intravenous administration of Obizur 
was lower than after intravenous administration of Hyate:C. Consequently, the exposure of Obizur is 
higher than the exposure obtained after administration of the same dose of Hyate:C.

In another comparative toxicity study, cynomolgus monkeys were intravenously administered 82.5, 
247.5 and 825 U/kg Obizur or 100 U/kg Hyate:C or Obizur vehicle for up to 90 days (PCM-102). Blood 
samples were collected for toxicokinetic analysis prior to dosing, on Days 1, 7, 28 and 90. Factor VIII 
activity was assessed in plasma using a validated one-stage clotting assay and a validated 
chromogenic assay. 
An increase in factor VIII levels was observed at Days 1 and 7 one hour post-dose. Baseline values of 
factor VIII were higher on Day 7 for both Obizur and Hyate:C treated animals, demonstrating 
accumulating blood levels of factor VIII. By Days 28 and 90, plasma factor VIII levels were markedly 
reduced in all monkeys due to the development of anti-porcine factor VIII inhibitor antibodies which 
cross reacted with the monkey’s endogenous factor VIII. 
• 
Interspecies comparison 
A comparative assessment of the systemic exposure to Obizur in dogs (PCD-101, 08/PKR), monkeys 
(PCM-105, 08/PKR/017) and humans was conducted (see Table 8). Exposure values were higher in the 
haemophilia A dogs. The exposure in the monkeys and humans with haemophilia A intravenously 
administered Obizur were more comparable. The data provide support to the selection of cynomolgus 
monkey as the non-rodent animal species for the toxicology studies.

Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance of Obizur was assessed as part of the repeat dose toxicity studies where animals 
were intravenously administered Obizur. Daily intravenous administration of Obizur for up to 90 days, 
at dose levels up to 825 U/kg/day, or Hyate:C at 100 U/kg/day, was well tolerated locally by 
cynomolgus monkeys.

Immunotoxicity 
Immunogenicity studies were conducted with Obizur in haemophilia A mice and cynomolgus monkeys. 
The factor VIII inhibitor antibody activity in the plasma of monkeys was determined using a mixing 
test. Factor VIII activity was measured by the one stage clotting assay and/or the chromogenic assay. 
The mixing assay was employed to determine the formation of inhibitory factor VIII antibodies in the 
cynomolgus monkey from repeat dose studies (PCM-101, PCM-102 and PCM-105). Assays were 
validated using a standard composed of human haemophilic plasma with the addition of the porcine 
factor VIII product being tested (PCM-101, PCM-102). Assays were performed under GLP guidelines. 
Immunogenicity in the Haemophilia A mice pre-sensitised to recombinant human factor VIII 
A study was conducted to determine the immunogenicity of Obizur in haemophilia A mice pre-
sensitised to recombinant human factor VIII and to compare it to the immunogenicity of Hyate:C 
(PCMU-102). 
Male and female haemophilia A mice (n=119 male and female), were intravenously administered 100 
U/kg recombinant human factor VIII weekly for a total of five injections. Tail snip blood samples were 
collected one week after the fifth injection for the measurement of anti-human factor VIII antibodies 
by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
At 16-21 weeks after the last injection of human factor VIII, mice tested positive for anti-factor VIII 
antibodies were randomised to receive 4 weekly injections of Obizur or Hyate:C at dose levels of 1, 10, 
100 U/kg (n=16 to 17/group). Two weeks following the last injection of Obizur or Hyate:C, blood 
samples were taken to determine the levels of anti-human factor VIII antibodies, anti-Obizur 
antibodies and, anti-plasma derived factor VIII antibodies and anti-Hyate:C antibodies.

Inhibitory IgG antibodies were measured using a modified Bethesda assay in which human haemophilia 
A plasma was reconstituted with Obizur or Hyate:C, depending on which test material the animal 
received. 
An increase in antibody titers (including both inhibitory and non-inhibitory antibodies) to Obizur 
porcine factor VIII or plasma derived porcine factor VIII antibodies was determined in plasma from the 
Obizur and Hyate:C treatment groups, respectively. For the Obizur mice, there was a statistically 
significant increase in antibody titers in the 100 U/kg group compared to the 1 U/kg and 10 U/kg 
groups. The difference between the 1 U/kg and the 10 U/kg groups was not significant. Similarly, for 
the Hyate:C-treated mice, there was a statistically significant increase in titers in the 100 U/kg group 
compared to 1 U/kg and 10 U/kg groups. Additionally, there was a statistically significant increase in 
the 10 U/kg group compared to the 1 U/kg group. 
Measurement of inhibitory antibodies showed that in the Obizur mice there was a significant increase in 
the factor VIII titer in the 100 U/kg group compared to the 1 U/kg and the 10 U/kg groups. The 
difference between the 1 U/kg and the 10 U/kg groups was not significant. Similarly, in the Hyate:C 
mice, there was a significant increase in the factor VIII inhibitor titer in the 100 U/kg group compared 
to the 1 U/kg and 10 U/kg groups, but no significant difference between the 1 U/kg and 10 U/kg 
groups. No significant difference was detected between the Obizur and the Hyate:C groups in inhibitory 
antibody formation at 1, 10 or 100 U/kg. 
There were several mice both in the Obizur and Hyate:C groups that developed anti-porcine factor VIII 
antibodies, but not inhibitory antibodies. In mice with positive Bethesda titers, there was a significant 
correlation between ELISA and Bethesda titers in both the Obizur and Hyate:C groups. In both the 
Obizur and Hyate:C groups, there was no significant correlation between the development of human 
factor VIII antibodies in the pre-sensitisation period and subsequent development of porcine factor VIII 
antibodies as detected by ELISA or Bethesda assay. 
A dose escalation tolerability study of Obizur administered by intravenous injection to cynomolgus 
monkeys 
The intravenous administration of Obizur by repeated daily intravenous injection at doses of 100, 300, 
600 or 1000 U/kg (dose increments every 7 days) was well-tolerated in male and female cynomolgus 
monkeys (PCM-101). There were no clinical signs indicative of an adverse effect or changes in body 
weight or vital signs that were related to test article administration. Based on the results of this study, 
the apparent maximum tolerable dose of Obizur in monkeys was considered to be at least 1000 U/kg. 
After 14 days of administration of Obizur (7 days each of 100 and 300 U/kg) inhibitor antibodies to 
factor VIII, were detected.  
A comparative immunogenicity study, up to 85 days duration, of Obizur versus Hyate:C administered 
by intravenous injection to cynomolgus monkeys 
A study was conducted to compare the immunogenicity of Obizur and Hyate:C in cynomolgus monkeys 
(PCM-105). Cynomolgus monkeys (n=8/sex) were intravenously administered one injection every 
twelve hours of Obizur (at 40 or 100 U/kg) or Hyate:C (at 100 U/kg) for 4 days. Blood samples were 
collected for inhibitory antibody analyses on Days 1 (pre-dose), 8, 15, 29, 43, 57 and 85. The study 
was concluded when all monkeys demonstrated inhibitor titers below 20 Bethesda Unit (BU) and had 
stable or falling inhibitor antibody titers compared to the previous time point. The inhibitory factor VIII 
antibodies were determined using an anti-porcine factor VIII inhibitor Bethesda assay. 
Monkeys in the 40 U/kg Obizur dose group did not develope anti-porcine factor VIII inhibitory 
antibodies and the group was therefore discontinued from the study at Day 43.

Only 2 of 5 monkeys from the Obizur and 2 of 6 Hyate:C animals treated at 100 U/kg developed 
inhibitor antibodies greater than 1 BU. There was no value greater than 20 BU. The study was 
terminated at Day 57. At this time point, the porcine titers were 8.5 and 2.2 BU in the Hyate:C group 
and 8.6 and 3.1 BU in the Obizur group.  
Metabolites

Studies on impurities 
Potential process-related impurities and the presence or absence in the Obizur drug substance were 
outlined and extensively characterized in the manufacturing process; evaluation of impurity clearance 
through the downstream processing steps of the commercial-scale manufacturing process is described.  
None of the impurities in Obizur FBDS were identified to be at levels posing a toxicological risk for 
patients.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment is not submitted as the product is exempted (See Section 2.3.6.). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Sucoctocog alfa is a B-domain deleted form of porcine factor VIII and is manufactured in a baby 
hamster kidney (BHK) derived cell line.  
In vitro, the stoichiometry of binding between susoctocog alfa with vWF was approximately 1:1 mole 
equivalent.  
Using the chromogenic assay, batches of OBI-1 DP and DS were shown to be capable of reacting with 
thrombin and Factor IXa to catalyse the activation of Factor X. Obizur batches of drug substance and 
drug product tested showed comparable Factor X activation near the target potency of 1100U/mL and 
500 U/mL, respectively. Using the one-stage coagulation assay, susoctocog alfa was shown to be 
activated by thrombin and react with Factor IXa to initiate the coagulation cascade, leading to clotting 
in Factor VIII-deficient plasma. Batches of the drug substance and drug product showed clotting 
activity near the target potency of 1000 U/mL and 500 U/mL, respectively. 
The administration of Obizur dose-dependently prevented blood loss in a murine model of haemophilia 
A. The efficacy was comparable to Hyate:C, a plasma derived porcine factor VIII. In a canine model of 
haemophilia A, susoctocog alfa in a dose range from 3 to 100 U/kg effectively decreased the bleeding 
tendency in the haemophilia A dog, as assessed by the CBT. 
No specific secondary pharmacodynamic studies and on pharmacodynamic drug interaction were 
conducted; the programme for the preclinical safety and efficacy testing of susoctocog aims to assess 
a protein of known pharmacological action that has a comparable mode of activity to plasma-derived 
human FVIII (pd-FVIII). No specific safety pharmacology studies were conducted. This is acceptable as 
part of toxicity studies of up to 90 days, intravenous doses of up to 1000 U/kg/day had no adverse 
effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory parameters measured. 
The cynomolgus monkey was selected as the non-rodent animal species for the toxicology studies 
based on the fact that no relevant differences in plasma clearance and volume of distribution were 
observed between monkeys and humans.

In haemophilia A dogs administered a single IV injection of Obizur at doses of 3, 25 and 100 U/kg, no 
adverse effects were observed. In monkeys, a single IV injection of OBI-1 at doses of 49.5 and 77 
U/kg did not induce any adverse effects.  
In monkeys, repeated daily intravenous injection of susoctocog alfa for 28 days at doses of 100, 300, 
600 and 1000 U/kg (dose increments every 7 days) induced no clinical signs indicative of an adverse 
effect or changes in body weight and vital signs. After 14 days of administration of susoctocog alfa 
inhibitor antibodies to factor VIII, were detected. 
A study was conducted to determine the potential toxicity and immunogenicity of susoctocog alfa when 
administered by daily intravenous injection to monkeys for up to 90 days, compared to animals treated 
with Hyate:C. Following daily intravenous administration of susoctocog alfa a slight dose -related 
reduction in aPTT was noted on Day 7. This was also observed in Hyate:C-treated animals. It was 
possible that this change reflected a slight augmentation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway by both 
factor VIII test articles, which is consistent with the pharmacologic nature of these agents. Clinical 
signs, changes in haematology and coagulation parameters (prolongation of aPTT, which may have 
contributed to the deep tissue bleeding) and/or gross necropsy findings observed after prolonged 
administration of susoctocog alfa  were attributed to the formation of inhibitory antibodies to 
exogenous factor VIII that cross reacted with endogenous factor VIII. However, the incidence of 
clinical signs (intra-articular and soft tissue haemorrhage) and related changes indicating an ‘acquired 
haemophilia’ condition were low. The formation of inhibitory antibodies was detected in all animals 
treated with susoctocog alfa or Hyate:C. At necropsy, there were no gross or histological findings 
suggesting toxicity related to susoctocog alfa. Glomerulopathy observed following administration of 
susoctocog alfa and Hyate:C was not associated with any changes in plasma creatinine and urea and 
was considered most likely due to immune complex deposition. It was concluded that susoctocog alfa 
was well tolerated at doses up to 825 U/kg.  
In a toxicokinetics study, following twice daily injections over 4 days of susoctocog alfa or Hyate:C to 
cynomolgus monkeys, exposure to susoctocog alfa at steady state appeared higher compared to those 
of Hyate:C. 
In a 90-day toxicity study, increasing plasma factor VIII levels were determined after daily injections 
of susoctocog alfa up to day 7 in monkeys. The formation of inhibitory antibodies (which led to a 
decrease in circulating factor VIII), increase in aPTT and bleeding in tissues and joints, precluded the 
conduct of chronic toxicology studies beyond three months of administration.  
In intravenous studies, the systemic exposure to susoctocog alfa was higher in the haemophilia A dogs 
than in humans with haemophilia A administered 100 U/kg and monkeys dosed 77 U/kg. The exposure 
in the monkeys and humans with haemophilia A intravenously administered susoctocog alfa were more 
comparable. 
No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been performed as susoctocog alfa is a recombinant 
protein. According to ICH S6 guideline recommendations, the omission of studies on genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity is justified. In a 90 day toxicity study 
there was no histopathological evidence of treatment-related effects on reproductive organs. Animal 
reproduction studies have not been conducted with OBIZUR. Experience regarding the use of OBIZUR 
during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, OBIZUR should be used during 
pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated. This information is included in section 4.6 of the 
SmPC and complies with the core SmPC wording for human plasma derived and recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/1619/1999 rev. 1); the lack of such studies is also 
stated under section 5.3.  
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015

Page 30/82 
 
 
 
 
In a local tolerance study in monkeys, susoctocog alfa was generally well tolerated following IV 
administration of up to 825 U/kg/day for 90 days. 
In male and female haemophilia A mice intravenously administered 100 U/kg recombinant human 
factor VIII weekly for a total of five injections, inhibitory antibodies to porcine factor VIII were 
detected in both the susoctocog alfa -treated mice and Hyate:C-treated mice. No significant difference 
in inhibitory antibody formation was detected between the Obizur and the Hyate:C-treated groups 
(dosed at 1, 10 or 100 U/kg). In both the susoctocog alfa and Hyate:C-treated groups, there was no 
correlation between the development of human factor VIII antibodies and subsequent development of 
porcine factor VIII antibodies as detected by ELISA or Bethesda assay. This suggests that haemophilia 
A mice might recognise different T cell epitopes and/or B cell epitopes in human and porcine factor 
VIII. 
Monkeys administered susoctocog alfa 40 U/kg by IV injection did not develop anti-porcine factor VIII 
inhibitory antibodies. There was no difference observed in the incidence or duration of the inhibitor 
antibodies in monkeys administered susoctocog alfa or Hyate:C at the 100 U/kg dose level. 
Recombinant porcine factor VIII, susoctocog alfa, was not shown to be more immunogenic than 
Hyate:C in this study. 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology or repeated dose toxicity. However, in repeated dose toxicity studies, the incidence and 
severity of glomerulopathy observed in monkeys intravenously administered OBIZUR at doses of 75, 
225 and 750 U/kg/day tended to increase over time.  
According to the “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medical products for human use” 
substances like amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted from the 
guideline since they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment, Obizur is thereby 
exempted, consequently, an environmental risk assessment is not required.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study OBI-1-301 was an open-label study evaluating Obizur in 28 subjects with acquired haemophilia 
(subjects had autoimmune inhibitory antibodies to human factor VIII). 6 subjects in study OBI-1-301 
consented to a pharmacokinetic sub-study.  
The pharmacokinetics of Obizur were to be assessed during the bleeding state by sparse 
pharmacokinetic analysis but this could not be done because not enough samples were obtained. 
Samples were collected during a non-bleeding state for pharmacokinetic analysis. For consenting 
subjects, serial blood samples were obtained after the final dose at the following time points: before 
dose, 15 to 20 minutes after dose, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after dose.  
Blood samples were analysed by central laboratories.

A routine non-compartmental analysis was used to estimate half-life and the trapezoidal rule was used 
to determine AUC, plasma clearance and volume of distribution. Generally, all samples in the log-linear 
terminal elimination phase were used in the determination of t 1/2, except if they were the Cmax 
samples. For each subject, the following were determined: t 1/2, Tmax, Amax, AUC from Time 0 to last 
measurement, AUC from Time 0 extrapolated to infinity, clearance and the volume of distribution at 
steady state. 
Individual and summary final dose pharmacokinetic parameters from the chromogenic and one-stage 
factor VIII activity assays (baseline-corrected values) are presented in the following table: 
Pharmacokinetic data of study OBI-1-301/301a were re-calculated using data without baseline 
correction. The re-calculated PK-data for factor VIII activity after administration of the final dose of 
OBIZUR to 5 subjects with acquired haemophilia are presented in the table below. Subjects were in a 
non-bleeding state. Factor VIII activity was measured by the one-stage clotting assay.

The mean half-life of Obizur in nine evaluable subjects in the bleeding state was (about) 10hrs (range 
2.6 to 28.6hrs). 
Additional pharmacokinetic data 
Pharmacokinetic data are also submitted from studies OBI-1-201 and OBI-1-101. 
Study OBI-1-201 
Study OBI-1-201 was a multicentre, open-label, non-comparative study assessing the haemostatic 
activity, the safety, the immunogenicity and the pharmacokinetics of Obizur in subjects with congenital 
haemophilia A and inhibitors to factor VIII experiencing non–life-threatening or non– limb-threatening 
bleeds. 
9 subjects were enrolled. 
Subjects received Obizur, up to 1,000 units/kg/day, as follows: 
• 
• 
Initial dose, second dose, third dose: 50 units/kg 
Fourth dose, fifth dose, sixth dose: 100 units/kg 
•  Seventh dose, eighth dose: 150 units/kg 
The rate of infusion was 1mL/min (increased to 2mL/min if infusion-related events were not observed). 
Obizur doses were no less than 6 hours apart. Treatment was given until the bleeding episode was 
controlled or 8 injections had been administered or the subject had received 1000U/kg/24hrs or the 
investigator deemed that Obizur was not effective. 
Clinical assessments of the patient’s signs and symptoms determined whether the bleeding episode 
had been controlled or whether additional doses of Obizur were administered.  
Blood samples were to be taken just prior to the first treatment for a subject’s first bleed episode and 
0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 24, 32 and 48 hours after the first treatment.

In addition, 3 subjects without measurable anti–porcine factor VIII antibodies at screening had limited 
data collected for the calculation of PK parameters. Five subjects had measurable anti–porcine factor 
VIII antibodies at the start of the first treatment with rpFVIII. In four of these subjects a partial PK 
profile was available. These subjects received further treatment six hours after the first rpFVIII 
treatment dose administration, therefore only Cmax, tmax and AUC0-6h could be calculated. Table 3 
provides the calculated PK-parameters normalized by the administered dose for these 8 subjects.

Study OBI-1-101 
Study OBI-1-101 was a Phase 1, parallel-group study comparing the safety and tolerability of Obizur 
versus Hyate:C when administered to subjects with congenital haemophilia A with inhibitors in a non-
bleeding state and who had low or absent anti–porcine factor VIII antibody titres. 
9 subjects were enrolled (enrolment was discontinued early when Hyate:C was withdrawn from the 
market). 
The Obizur pharmacokinetic population included 3 subjects who had an anti–porcine factor VIII 
inhibitory antibody titre <0.80 BU and sufficient measurable factor VIII activity levels after receipt of 
100 units/kg of study product to allow calculation of pharmacokinetic values. There were also 3 
subjects in the HYATE:C population. 
Subjects were randomized to receive on Day 1, while in the non-bleeding state either: 
• 
• 
a single dose of 100 U/kg Hyate:C (administered at 3mL/min) or placebo 
placebo or a single dose of 100 U/kg OBI-1 (administered at 1mL/min) 
Each subject received only one study product in addition to the administration of placebo. 
A baseline sample for factor VIII activity was collected immediately before study product 
administration. Subsequent collections for measurement of drug concentrations were taken at the 
following time points, with the start of dosing being Time 0: 20, 40, 60, 65, 75, 85, 105 and 125 
minutes and then at 3, 6, 9, 24, 27, 30 and 48 hours after dose. 
The following plots show time courses of both Obizur and Hyate:C as measured by the one-stage 
clotting assay:

Drug exposure measured by AUC and recovery were approximately twice as high with Obizur than with 
Hyate:C at the same dosage. 
However, Obizur could be administered 5-6 times more rapidly than Hyate:C owing to the much higher 
concentration of factor VIII. As a result, the shape of the time-concentration curve after administration 
of the same 100-U/kg dose of each product differed, making it appear as though OBI-1 had an even 
higher recovery than Hyate:C.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No pharmacodynamic studies on the mechanism of action were submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology  
Obizur (factor VIII) activity was measured in clinical studies 101, 201 and 301. Dedicated 
pharmacodynamic studies were not submitted. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Susoctocog alfa is a recombinant, B-domain deleted, porcine sequence Factor VIII. Immediately after 
release into the circulation, human Factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor (vWF). The Factor 
VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor) 
with different physiological functions. Activated Factor VIII acts as a co-factor for activated Factor IX, 
accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X, which ultimately converts prothrombin 
into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. The omission of 
pharmacodynamic studies on the mechanism of action of Obizur is justified as susoctocog is a protein 
of known pharmacological action that has a comparable mode of activity to plasma-derived human 
FVIII (pd-FVIII).

The omission of pharmacodynamic studies on the mechanism of action is justified as susoctocog is a 
protein of known pharmacological action that has a comparable mode of activity to plasma-derived 
human FVIII (pd-FVIII). 
Studies OBI-1-101 and OBI-1-201 with congenital haemophilia A patients suggest that the half-life of 
Obizur is (about) 10hrs. Visual inspection of results of AHA patients in study OBI-1-301/301a whilst in 
the bleeding state also suggests that the half-life of Obizur is (about) 10hrs. Plasma FVIII activities 
were measured by the one stage clotting assay on a Sysmex CA-6000 analyser and calibrated with 
human plasma-derived FVIII. In order to more fully validate the assay, the Applicant has agreed to 
provide further validation data for the OSCA assay using a Sysmex CA-7000 analyser and Obizur as 
the test analyte.   
Only 5 subjects in study OBI-1-301 returned adequate results for a pharmacokinetic analysis whilst 
haematologically stable. The half-life of Obizur in these patients in non-bleeding state was (about) 
3.5hrs which was considerably shorter than in studies OBI-1-101 and OBI-1-201. Results of clearance 
and steady state volume of distribution in these 4 patients varied markedly and were also different 
from those reported in studies OBI-1-101 and OBI-1-201. It is suggested that the short half-life in 
acquired haemophilia A patients may be due to high-affinity autoantibodies against human FVIII which 
may cross-react with porcine FVIII. It is acknowledged that the number of patients available to be 
studied is small in this rare condition and that further investigation of this issue would be difficult. The 
PK-data in study OBI-1-301 was biased by the baseline endogenous FVIII levels and the baseline-
corrected PK-data underestimates the half-life, AUC and other parameters. Of note, the mean half-life 
of Obizur in nine evaluable subjects in the bleeding state was (about) 10hrs (range 2.6 to 28.6hrs). 
There is no international standard for possible ADA measurements the assay for neutralising antibodies 
has been partly validated, but the accuracy due to the missing standard is questioned and is not in line 
with the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009).  
Furthermore,  the  method  for  detection  of  inhibitory  antibodies  needs  further  validation.  Validation  of 
the  Bethesda  assay  was  performed  by  use  of  a  monoclonal  anti-FVIII  antibody  against  human  FVIII, 
representing  the  positive  test  sample  in  the  validation  experiments  and  data  from  analysis  of  this 
antibody  analyzed  at  various  concentrations  were  used  to  assess  precision  and  lower  limit  of 
quantification  of  the  assay,  further  information  or  characterisation  data  on  this  control  has  not  been 
provided.  Considering  possible  differences  between  anti-human  FVIII  antibodies  and  anti-porcine-
Obizur antibodies, it is difficult to make any conclusions about the validity of the ADA assays in place. 
Overall,  current  approach  allows  only  identification  of  inhibiting  ADAs.  A  recommendation  is  made  to 
the Applicant to continue work on the validation of specific porcine ADA assays.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of Obizur has not raised any particular concerns. 
The CHMP considers the following recommendations for future continuous development in 
pharmacology:  
1.  The Applicant should continue/complete the validation of the OSCA  by performing additional 
validation experiments at Sanquin using Obizur as test analyte to confirm that the OSCA 
provides valid activity data also for that protein. 
The company should continue to monitor the OSCA assay for potential sources of variability, 
e.g. new equipment and reagents and should consider periodically repeating the study where 
spiked plasma samples with Obizur are assayed by many different hospital laboratories to 
confirm the robustness of the OSCA assay when used with Obizur.  
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 39/82 
 
 
 
 
2.  As there are no screening or confirmatory assays in place to detect possible anti-drug 
antibodies, and as the method detecting inhibitory antibodies against Obizur is validated using 
only human plasma-derived FVIII, the company could consider carrying out further work for 
establishing and validating specific porcine ADA-assays.

2.5.2.  Main study 
Study OBI-1-301/301a: Efficacy and safety of B-domain deleted recombinant porcine factor VIII 
(Obizur) in the treatment of acquired haemophilia A due to autoimmune anti-factor VIII inhibitory 
antibodies 
This is a case series study, OBI-1-301 and an expanded access programme done agreed with the FDA, 
the OBI-1-301a study of 29 patients in total - summarised in the following table: 
Study design: OBI-1-301/301a was an international, prospective, non-randomised, open-label, single 
cohort study that includes Obizur treatment of serious bleeds in subjects with acquired haemophilia A 
aged 18yrs and over. Also, a pharmacokinetic study was done in successfully treated subjects. 
Dates of study: First subject in: 10th November 2010; Last subject out: 9th October 2013 
The study was administered centrally at Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Westlake Village, CA, USA) 
where the trial master file is maintained.

Exclusion criteria 
Haemodynamic instability (after volume replacement) 
Bleeding episode likely to resolve on its own if left untreated. 
Anti- Obizur inhibitor that exceeds 20 Bethesda Units (prospectively or retrospectively) 
Re-bleed at qualifying bleeding site within 2 weeks (or 1 week at non-qualifying site) will not be 
regarded as ‘new’ episodes 
Reason for bleeding that is not correctable 
The following concomitant medications were not permitted during this study: 
•  Haemophilia medication (rFVIIa within 3 hours or aPCC within 6 hours of OBI-1 administration 
•  Haemophilia medication other than OBI-1 at any time during the study unless required for use 
as rescue medication after failure/study withdrawal. 
• 
Treatments 
Selection of doses: dosing was based on results of the phase 1 & 2 studies. 
If potential participants were in a non- bleeding state (i.e. has a pre-established diagnosis of acquired 
haemophilia) then they were pre-qualified for study eligibility and only enrolled at the time a serious 
bleeding episode occurred. 
All eligible subjects were assigned to the treatment group.  
Initial dose: 200U/kg Obizur dose was infused intravenously at a rate of 1 to 2 mL/min. 
The decision to administer additional Obizur doses was made by the investigator based on an 
assessment of the subject’s clinical response to treatment and FVIII activity trough levels. 
Treatment phase 
FVIII levels were assessed approximately every 2 to 3 hours for the first 24 hours.  
The decision to administer additional Obizur doses was made by the investigator based on the subject’s 
FVIII activity trough levels (>80% for bleeding episode of particular concern, >50% for all other 
serious bleeds) and clinical status. 
•  Severe intramuscular and joint bleeds: target trough FVIII activity levels ≥50% 
•  Retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, intracranial bleeds: target trough FVIII activity levels ≥80% 
When FVIII activity levels were not optimal, repeat infusions could be carried out at shorter intervals 
and / or higher doses but the dose of Obizur administered were not to exceed 400 U/kg every 2 hours 
(4800 U/kg/24 hours) and blood levels of FVIII activity not to exceed 200% (U/dL). 
If consecutive FVIII activity levels indicated a decline of ≤10% in 4 hours, the interval between 
sampling could be increased to every 4-6 hours 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 41/82 
 
 
 
 
If FVIII activity levels remained ≥50% even after administration of two or more additional doses of 
Obizur after the initial Obizur infusion, and the clinical response observed was not positive, the decision 
to discontinue Obizur therapy and switch to an alternative therapy had to be considered by the 
investigator. 
If FVIII activity levels ≥50% were obtained, but no positive clinical response was observed, 
consideration were given to the need for additional interventions (such as surgery) to address 
uncontrolled bleeding that was not associated with the acquired anti-FVIII inhibitor. 
Obizur treatment continued until either bleeding was successfully controlled or Obizur treatment was 
discontinued due to lack of efficacy as judged by the investigator or until the subject withdrew from 
the study. 
•  Non-target bleeding sites 
Non-target bleeding sites were evaluated at the same time as the target bleeding site 
according to the schedule of assessments but were not included in the efficacy assessment of 
the target bleeding site(s). 
•  New bleeding sites not present at study entry 
New bleeding sites also occurred that were not present at study entry: they were recorded as 
adverse events. For subjects who had positive responses to OBI-1, subsequent serious 
bleeding episodes (treated as in-patient) were eligible for treatment with OBI-1 but were not 
considered as qualifying bleeding episodes for the purposes of primary efficacy analysis.  
•  Re-occurrence of bleed at target site 
Bleeding that occurred at the same site of the qualifying bleed after initially successful 
haemostasis, and prior to 2 weeks following the last OBI-1 dose, was considered a continuation 
of the same bleeding episode. These were recorded as adverse events. 
Healing phase 
Once a subject’s initial bleed was successfully controlled with Obizur, he/she could receive further 
therapy with OBI-1 to allow healing to take place with the dose designed to maintain the required 
trough levels (30-40%) and a maximum blood level not to exceed 200% (U/dL). 
•  All bleed types, target trough FVIII activity 30-40% 
• 
The maximum blood FVIII activity level was not to exceed 200% 
FVIII levels and clinical status were monitored at least every 24 hours during the healing phase until 
the healing process was completed as determined by the investigator. 
Compliance was ensured by Obizur being administered by the investigator and assessed by vial count, 
documented in the case report file. 
The independent data safety monitoring board monitored dosing. 
Follow-up phase 
Subjects were followed for 90 (±7) days after the final Obizur dose. 
If a subsequent bleeding event was experienced during the follow-up period requiring treatment, the 
subject was followed for the 90 (±7) days after the final Obizur dose for treatment of the subsequent 
bleeding event. 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 42/82 
 
 
 
 
Subsequent bleeding events were eligible for treatment with Obizur if the primary bleed was 
considered successfully treated. 
Inhibitor titres to both human and porcine FVIII were collected at each follow-up visit (days 14, 28, 60 
and 90 post-treatment). 
Pharmacokinetic study 
Agreement to participate in the pharmacokinetic part of the study was not mandatory for study 
participation. 
Where possible, a final dose was provided and samples were obtained according to the following 
schedule relative to the final Obizur infusion and at 15-20 min, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24hrs post infusion.  
Pharmacokinetic data was also acquired during the healing phase after the bleeding was controlled and 
the subject health status was stable. 
Medications not permitted: 
•  Haemophilia medication (rFVIIa within 3 hours or aPCC within 6 hours prior to Obizur 
administration) 
•  Haemophilia medication other than Obizur at any time during the study unless required for use 
as rescue medication. 
• 
Assays 
Central laboratories were used for the protocol-required laboratory tests anti–human FVIII and anti– 
Obizur antibody titres, FVIII activity levels anti-BHK cell antibodies. Local laboratories were used for 
the following protocol-required laboratory tests FVIII activity levels, anti–human FVIII and anti– Obizur 
antibody titres. 
Assays for FVIII activity were done using the one-stage and the chromogenic assays at the central and 
local laboratories. Anti-human FVIII and anti- Obizur inhibitor titres were determined by the Nijmegen 
modification of the Bethesda assay.  
Measurements aimed to guide dosing were performed at the investigator’s local laboratory. Local 
laboratories were pre-qualified for ability to provide these services prior to study participation. 
To confirm local laboratory results, a central reference laboratory determined FVIII activity level, anti-
human FVIII and anti- Obizur inhibitor titres on samples collected prior to Obizur treatment and at the 
follow up visits (14 ±3 days, 28 ±3 days, 60 ±5 days and 90 ±7 days). 
Anti-baby hamster kidney antibody titres were determined at the central laboratory in samples 
collected prior to treatment and at the final visit.

Obizur 
Page 43/82 
 
 
 
 
•  Assess the efficacy of Obizur at designated time points after the initiation of therapy 
•  Determine the frequency, total dose and total number of infusions of Obizur required to control 
all serious bleeding events 
•  Assess the correlation between response to Obizur therapy at specified assessment time points 
and eventual control of serious bleeding events 
•  Assess the correlation between the pre-infusion anti– Obizur inhibitor titre, the total dose of 
Obizur, the outcome at 24 hours and the eventual control of the bleeding event 
•  Assess the anti– Obizur inhibitor level before infusion, at specified time points during treatment 
and at the end of the follow-up period at 90 days after final infusion 
• 
Evaluate the safety of Obizur 
•  Assess drug exposure by using extensive (non-bleeding state) or sparse sampling (bleeding 
state), and a population pharmacokinetic approach (with sparse data) in subjects treated with 
OBI-1 therapy 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: the proportion of serious bleeding episodes responsive to Obizur therapy at 
24 hours after the initiation of treatment based on assessment of effectiveness and FVIII blood levels. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints  
• 
• 
• 
The overall proportion of serious bleeding episodes successfully controlled with Obizur therapy, 
as assessed by the investigator. 
The proportion of bleeding episodes responsive to Obizur therapy at designated assessment 
time points after the initiation of therapy, as assessed by the investigator 
Frequency, total dose, and total number of infusions of Obizur required to successfully control 
qualifying bleeding episodes. 
•  Correlation between response to Obizur therapy at specified time points and eventual control of 
serious bleeding episodes. 
•  Correlation between the pre-infusion anti- Obizur antibody titres, the total dose of Obizur, the 
outcome at 24 hours and the eventual control of the bleeding episode. 
•  Drug exposure was determined by means of population pharmacokinetic analysis for the 
sparse-bleeding state-data, and compartmental analysis for the complete-non- bleeding state-
data. 
Safety Endpoints 
The safety of Obizur was assessed from the following: 
• 
Treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events throughout the study 
•  Vital signs 
•  Routine laboratory testing  
•  Anti-human factor VIII antibody titre 
•  Anti- Obizur antibody titre 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 44/82 
 
 
 
 
•  Anti-host cell protein antibody titre 
Incidence of treatment emergent adverse events were summarised by system organ class, severity 
and relationship to Obizur treatment. 
Primary Efficacy Assessment 
Prior to amendment 3, protocols OBI-1-301 and OBI-1-301a used a “three-point” scale of the 
investigator’s assessment, as shown: 
A four-point scale of the investigator’s assessment was implemented when protocol OBI-1-301 
Amendment 3.0 came into effect, as shown: 
In both scales, a positive response was defined as effective or partially effective control of bleeding. 
Because the definition of a positive response was identical for the three- and four-point scales, data 
from the two scales was combined for statistical analysis of the number of subjects with a positive 
bleeding response to Obizur therapy. 
Secondary Efficacy Assessments 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 45/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assessment of FVIII activity level 
Assessment of FVIII activity level was conducted at least every 2-3 hours for the first 24 hours after 
the initial dose of Obizur except where slow decline in activity was documented. 
Following the first 24 hours, FVIII activity measurements were conducted with each subsequent dose 
of Obizur throughout treatment and at a minimum of once every 24 hours if dosing was less frequent 
than daily. 
Exposure to OBI-1 
Total dose, total number of Obizur infusions and the exact time of each infusion were recorded. 
Assessment of response to Obizur treatment 
Assessment of response to Obizur treatment was performed after each dose of OBI-1 or at least every 
8 hours after the initial dose of Obizur for the first 24 hours using the 3- or 4-point scale, as described. 
Between Day 1 and Day 5 of treatment, the response to Obizur was assessed after each Obizur dose or 
at least every 12 hours. Subsequent assessments were conducted at each dose or at least every 24 
hours thereafter until after the last Obizur treatment dose or withdrawal.  
Timing of assessments was relative to the administration of the first dose of Obizur until the resolution 
of the bleeding episode, failure of therapy was concluded or withdrawal of the subject. 
A serious bleeding episode was considered as successfully controlled if the investigator checked 
“Completed OBI-1 therapy as treatment success” from the electronic case report form. 
Assessment of control of bleeding 
The tools used to assess the control of bleeding depended upon the site of bleeding and included: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
obvious blood loss 
haematology results 
blood transfusion and blood component requirements 
physical or technological examination of the bleeding site 
imaging studies to assess the size of the bleeding site where this cannot be assessed by 
visually 
Sample size 
The study included 28 bleeding episodes in 28 unique subjects. 
The sample size estimate was based on showing that the lower 95% confidence interval for the 
response rate in this population was greater than a pre-specified limit derived from a literature review 
of studies in subjects with acquired haemophilia treated with plasma-derived porcine FVIII, rFVIIa and 
aPCC for serious but not-life threatening bleeding episodes and who showed efficacy rates from 55% to 
90% within 24 to 72 hours after initiation of therapy. 
Benefit for treatment with Obizur was concluded if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for 
the response rate was greater than 50% which required that the actual sample response rate was in 
excess of about 70%. 
Assuming a positive response rate (i.e. response defined as effective or partially effective control of 
bleeding at 24 hours) of 80% in the cohort of 28, a baseline low response rate of 50% and a two-sided

alpha of 0.05, a study of 28 bleeding events would have in excess of 90% power to test the null 
hypothesis that the response rate equalled 50% against the alternative hypothesis that the response 
rate was greater than 50%. 
• 
Randomisation 
The study was non-randomised. All eligible subjects were assigned to the treatment group.  
Only subjects with successful treatment of a serious bleed with Obizur were involved in the 
pharmacokinetic study. 
• 
Blinding  
This was an open-label study. 
• 
Statistical methods 
The rate of positive response was presented with a two sided 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence 
interval.  
Pharmacokinetic variables from the bleeding state were estimated by population pharmacokinetic 
modelling or when subject’s pharmacokinetic data were insufficient by a Bayesian approach using the 
established Obizur population pharmacokinetic model.  
Pharmacokinetic data from the non-bleeding state were analysed using a compartmental analysis.  
The “Intent-To-Treat” population (n = 29) consists of all eligible subjects who enrolled in the trial, 
were dosed and for whom any post-screening data are available. 
The “Per Protocol” population (n = 23) consists of all subjects from the “Intent-To-Treat” population 
who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
The “Pharmacokinetic” population (n = 9) consists of all subjects in the “Intent-To-Treat” population 
who consented to blood sampling for FVIII activity level measurements by the central reference 
laboratory. 
For the purposes of statistical analysis the “three-point” or “four-point” response assessment was 
converted to a binary response (positive or negative) based on clinical judgment and achieved FVIII 
levels. A positive response was defined as the investigator’s assessment that Obizur was effective or 
partially effective on both the three-point and four-point scales: 
• 
• 
Effective response: bleeding stopped, with clinical stabilization and FVIII levels of 50% or 
higher 
Partially effective: bleeding improved, with clinical stabilization and FVIII levels of 20% or 
higher. 
•  Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
•  Because of the variable duration of treatment, some subjects did not have equivalent time 
points collected. In this case, data were only analysed at each time point for subjects who had 
that assessment performed.  
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 47/82 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Eligible subjects who withdrew from treatment at an earlier time point were assumed to be 
non-responders at the subsequent time points. No subjects were replaced. 
•  Subjects who received clinical trial material but had an anti– Obizur titre of more than 20 
Bethesda Units within 24 hours after the initial Obizur dose were considered ineligible.  
• 
• 
Ineligible subjects could be continued to be treated but were not included in the analysis of the 
efficacy endpoints.  
Efficacy analyses were performed by using the ITT population including only eligible subjects. 
•  Subjects who had haemostatic response and stopped treatment because the bleeding was 
controlled, were assumed to be responders at subsequent time points. For analyses using the 
safety population, there was no imputation of missing endpoint values. 
•  Dates and times were not imputed unless needed for a calculation, in which case the most 
conservative (worst-case) date and time was used. In the case of determining baseline values, 
the last measurement before dosing was used.

Discontinuations 
10 subjects discontinued the study (all 10 were included in the Safety and “Per Protocol” analyses): 
•  4 because of adverse events 
•  1 subject was lost to follow-up 
•  1 because of lack of efficacy (continuous or recurrent bleed) 
•  1 developed inhibitors to Obizur 
•  1 subject had a ‘terminal status’ 
•  1 subject died 
•  1 subject discontinued because of non-compliance 
Reasons for discontinuation for the subjects who discontinued because of adverse events were: 
"technical problems" during third dose, (patient died shortly afterwards with intracranial 
haemorrhage); reason not explicitly stated but mental status changes developed on 9th day, treated 
with psychotropic medication and  intracranial haemorrhage detected on day leading to death; 
detection of anti- Obizur titre of 8 Bethesda units on day 7 (although subject had responded to Obizur 
treatment) – subsequent death due to intestinal haemorrhage; development of anti- Obizur antibodies; 
subject known to have chronic renal failure deteriorated and died on day 14. 
Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations were reported for 27 subjects during the study. Most deviations refer to missed 
blood (or urine) sample collections or inadequate samples, samples taken out of the specified window 
time or incorrect infusion rates. 
Six subjects were granted waivers for entry into the study despite not meeting all of the eligibility 
criteria and were excluded from the “Per Protocol” analysis

Conduct of the study 
12 study sites participated in this study. 2 sites enrolled subject under protocol OBI-1-301 and 
expanded access protocol OBI-1-301a; 2 sites enrolled subjects under OBI-1-301a only: 8 sites 
enrolled subjects under Protocol OBI-1-301 only. 
1 site enrolled 5 subjects, 3 sites enrolled 4 subjects each, 1 site enrolled 3 subjects and 2 sites 
enrolled 2 subjects each. Five sites enrolled and treated a single subject each. 
A study medical monitor was employed. Clinical research associates visited sites. Periodic site visits 
were scheduled within 2 weeks of a subject’s first dose and after a subject completed the follow up 
period (or was discontinued). Data verification was performed for all key data according to company 
SOPs. Source document verification was performed by direct access to subjects’ hospital and pharmacy 
records. 
A data monitoring and safety board was convened with three clinicians with expertise in haematology 
and one biostatistician. The board was responsible for assuring patient safety and assessing safety 
data. The board met at intervals and on an incident basis regarding serious adverse events. 
After the first 5 patients were enrolled and treated with Obizur, an interim analysis was done on 
summary data and reviewed by the company and data monitoring and safety board. The study would 
be stopped if 3 or more of the subject responses were considered to be negative. 
Amendments 
6 rounds of amendments were made between 14th July 2010 and 17th April 2013. Most of the 
amendments are clarifications. Of note: amendment 3.0 (12th February 2012) “The scale used for the 
primary endpoint was changed from a three-point to a four-point ordinal scale with the inclusion of the 
assessment of “poorly controlled” bleeding” and amendment 4.0 (17th April 2013) “study sponsor was 
changed from Inspiration Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. to Baxter”. Reversion to a 4-point scale was done 
after receiving advice from the CHMP.

Baseline data 
Demographics 
29 subjects enrolled (65.5% male, 34.5% female) 
18 were White/Caucasian, 6 were Black or African American and 5 were Asian.  
The median age was 70 years (range: 42-90 years).  
The median weight was 74.1 kg (range: 47.0-106.1 kg) and the median height was 168.3 cm (range: 
149-186 cm) 
14 subjects had a previous history of acquired haemophilia A. 
The time from first diagnosis of acquired haemophilia A was from 0 to 19 months.  
One patient presented with an intracranial bleed entered into the study and received 405,000 units of 
Obizur over 21 infusions but who was shown not to have anti-factor VIII antibodies. 
Another patient was also recorded as not having acquired haemophilia with inhibitors to factor VIII. 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015

Bleedings in the presented 28 subjects were: bleeding into muscle or joints (20); bleeding after 
surgery (3) intra-cranial bleed (1); retroperitoneal bleed (1); peri-orbital bleed (1); prior to surgery 
i.e. Obizur administered as prophylaxis (2). All bleeds are described as ‘limb- or life-threatening’. 
27 subjects received concomitant immunosuppression during the course of study participation, 22 
subjects had a significant medical history of cardiovascular disorders and 20 had endocrine / metabolic 
disorders; 11 subjects were reported as having received rFVIIa, aPCC or tranexamic acid prior to first 
treatment with Obizur. All dosing with Obizur was done on an inpatient basis and carried out by 
hospital staff. Compliance, expressed as a percentage of planned dose that was administered: the 
mean (SD) compliance for control of initial qualifying bleeding events was 99.83% (0.922).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Parameter 
A positive response was defined as the investigator’s assessment that Obizur was effective or partially 
effective on both the three-point and four-point scales. 
All 29 subjects (100%, 95% CI:88.1-100) were judged by the investigators to have a positive 
response to Obizur at 24 hours after initiation of treatment, as shown in the following table: 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 52/82 
 
 
 
 
 
A one-sided exact Binomial test was performed at the 2.5% level of statistical significance, and the p-
value based on intention to treat population (and the per protocol population) was <0.001 (statistically 
significant evidence in support of response rate >50%).  
No subjects were judged to have a negative response (poorly effective or not effective) to Obizur 
treatment at 24 hours after their initial dose.  
The per protocol analysis is shown below:  
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 53/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary Efficacy Parameters 
Treatment Success as Assessed by the Investigator 
A serious bleeding episode was considered as successfully controlled if the investigator checked 
“Completed Obizur therapy as treatment success” from the electronic case record file. Percentages are 
based on the total number of subjects with initial serious bleeding episodes.  
Qualifying bleeding events treated with Obizur were judged by the investigator to have been controlled 
successfully in 25/29 (86.2%) of subjects at the time of final treatment dosing or progression to 
healing phase dosing.  
A summary is shown in the following table for the intention to treat population: 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 54/82 
 
 
 
 
 
All 25 qualifying bleeds that achieved “treatment success” had a positive response to treatment within 
the first 24 hours.  
“Treatment success” was not achieved in 4 qualifying bleeds in 4 unique subjects, as assessed by the 
investigator (all 4 subjects did have a positive response to Obizur therapy at their qualifying bleeding 
site at 24 hours). 
Among the 4 subjects who did not achieve ”treatment success” (defined as control of qualifying 
bleeding event at the time of final treatment dosing), there were no apparent similarities in total dose 
or demographic characteristics. Of note, these 4 subjects did show a positive response at 8, 16 and 24 
hours after first infusion. 
The per protocol analysis is shown below: the per protocol analysis (87% success) supports the intent-
to-treat analysis (86% success). 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 55/82 
 
 
 
 
 
Response to Obizur Treatment at Specific Time Points 
Positive and negative bleeding responses to Obizur administration at specified time points after the 
initial Obizur dose are summarised for the intent-to-treat population in the following table: 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 56/82 
 
 
 
 
 
Some subjects were not assessed at all time-points. Of the 21 subjects assessed at 8 hours after the 
initial dose, 20 (95.2%) subjects showed a positive response to Obizur treatment, 19/19 subjects 
showed a positive response at 16 hours after initial infusion. 
Amount of Obizur Required to Control Bleeding 
Following the initial single 200 U/kg dose of Obizur, the investigator was to determine the subsequent 
doses based on clinical status and maintaining target FVIII activity trough levels. After successful 
control of the bleed, based on clinical assessment, Obizur treatment was either stopped or continued at 
lower dose / frequency (healing phase). For subjects whose qualifying bleeding event was controlled, a 
summary of dose and number of infusions of Obizur until control of the qualifying bleed is shown in the 
following table

For subjects whose qualifying bleeding event was controlled, a summary of dose and number of 
infusions of Obizur is shown in the following table for the entire duration of study participation: 
Response to OBI-1 Treatment at Specific Time Points Correlated with Control of the Bleeding Event 
Overall, subjects who were assessed to have a positive response to Obizur treatment earlier than 24 
hours after dosing initiation, achieved eventual control of the qualifying event (secondary outcome 
measure).  
Effect of Pre-infusion Anti–susoctocog alfa Titres and Anti-hFVIII Titres on Control of Bleeding Events 
The presence of anti–susoctocog alfa antibodies with titres above 20 BU was an exclusion criterion. 
Of the 4 subjects in whom bleed control was not achieved, 3 had no detectable anti-Obizur antibodies 
(titre <0.6 BU) and the fourth had a positive low Obizur titre (3 BU).  
Response to Obizur Treatment Non-target Bleeds 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 59/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
33 non-target bleeding events were reported in 17 subjects. 
23/33 bleeds resolved within 2 days after first assessment of the bleeding event. 
Response to Obizur Treatment for Subsequent Serious Bleeds  
Three subjects experienced a serious bleeding event subsequent to the qualifying bleed that was 
treated with susoctocog alfa.  
Bleeding events that were concurrent with or subsequent to the qualifying bleed (i.e. subsequent and 
non-target bleeds) were controlled in all but 2 subjects who died due to their co-morbidities.

Study OBI-1-201 
In  this  phase  II  study,  nine  subjects  (aged  from  14  to  34  years)  with  congenital  hemophilia  A  with 
inhibitors  to  human  rFVIII,  who  were  experiencing  a  non-life-  or  non-limb-threatening  bleeding 
episode,  received  rpFVIII.  As  this  study  refers  to  congenital  haemophilia  A,  it  is  only  discussed  from 
point of view of establishing the dose regimen. 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 61/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The dosing regimen included a loading dose (based on body weight, hematocrit and inhibitor titer) in 
subjects with measurable anti-rpFVIII antibody titers (but not in subjects without measurable antibody 
titers),  followed  by  up  to  eight  treatment  doses  of  rpFVIII  (50–150  U/kg)  at  intervals  of  up  to  6 
hours.The  loading  dose  used  in  the  main  study  OBI-1-301  was  derived  from  study  OBI-1-201  and 
calculated as: Loading Dose = body weight (kg) x 80 mL/kg x (1-hematocrit) x inhibitor titer.  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) recommended stopping the Phase II study 
after  reviewing  data  on  25  bleeding  episodes  in  nine  subjects,  concluding  that  data  on  three  more 
subjects would not modify the conclusion that rpFVIII was effective in establishing hemostasis. (A total 
of 12 subjects was originally planned.)  
The target of 24 bleeding episodes was exceeded by one bleeding episode, with nine subjects treated. 
All  bleeding  episodes  were  successfully  controlled  with  rpFVIII;  20/25  (80%)  bleeding  episodes  were 
controlled with one treatment dose plus the loading dose when applicable.  
The  median  dose  administered  for  these  20  bleeding  episodes  was  200.8  U/kg  (including  the  loading 
dose if applicable). Factor VIII levels were measured before and 0.5 hours after each treatment dose 
of rpFVIII. For all bleeding episodes, the initial factor VIII level was negligible before the first dose. The 
median first treatment dose (including the loading dose if applicable) for the 25 bleeding episodes was 
159  U/kg  and  resulted  in  a  median  factor  VIII  level  of  16%  thirty  minutes  after  the  initial  dose  of 
rpFVIII.  
The  DSMC  indicated  that  the  initial  dose  (loading  dose  +  first  treatment  dose)  did  not  equal  the 
amount specified in the protocol as the inhibitor titers against rpFVIII were often unknown  until after 
the  subject  was  dosed  and  treated.  The  DSMC  recommended  a  fixed initial dose  of  rpFVIII  for  future 
studies. 
Population PK analysis of rpFVIII combining data obtained in both the Phase I and the Phase II study 
(one-stage  coagulation  assay)  was  planned  but  not  eventually  performed.    This  study  is  further 
discussed from under Clinical safety. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This initial marketing authorisation application is based on one key phase 2/3 study (OBI-1-301 + OBI-
1-301a),  one  supportive  phase  2  study  (OBI-1-201)  and  one  phase  1  study  (OBI-1-101,  PK).  The 
Applicant  has  added  supportive  efficacy  data  from  the  Study  OBI-1-201  with  nine  subjects  with 
congenital  hemophilia  A  with  anti-hFVIII-inhibitors,  who  were  experiencing  a  non-life-  or  non-limb-
threatening  bleeding  episode,  as  this  study  is  intended  in  a  different  indication  the  results  are  only 
informative as a justification of the dose for the rpFVIII used. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study OBI-1-301/301a was an open-label, non-randomised, non-controlled, multi-centre, multinational 
study.  The  study  design  of  the  key  phase  2/3  study  is  acceptable  and  follows  the  various  CHMP 
Scientific advices.  
The sample size calculation for the overall population in the OBI-1-301 + OBI-1-301a is acceptable. 
Instead of minimum of 30 bleeding episodes in 30 different subjects as recommended by the CHMP, 
the number of subjects in the study was 29 which was reduced to a series of 28 patients with acquired 
haemophilia –as 1 patient did not have acquired haemophilia yet was entered into the study and 
consequently, the actual per protocol population was 22 (and not 23) subjects. A protocol assistance 
was given by the CHMP in December 2013 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/749449 /2013) in which it was 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 62/82 
 
 
 
 
acknowledged that the application would include 4 patients treated under an expanded access 
programme, as described.  
The study population is representative of the European patients with AHA and the selection criteria of 
patients into OBI-1-301 + OBI-1-301a are acceptable. 
The  primary  endpoint  was  “bleeding  stopped/  improved,  with  clinical  stabilization  and  FVIII  levels  of 
20%/50%  or  higher”  for  the  efficacy  of  rpFVIII  for  the  treatment  of  serious  bleeding  episodes  in 
subjects  with  acquired  hemophilia  which  is  appropriate  for  this  kind  of  study,  and  is  in  line  with  the 
given CHMP scientific advice. 
The study was done in hospital settings (hospitals named by the company are recognised as centres 
for management of haemophilia). Subjects were mostly elderly with extensive clinical histories. 
2 subjects received Obizur for prophylaxis of bleeding during a surgical procedure. All others presented 
as a clinical emergency with bleeds that threatened life and / or limb. 14 subjects were known to have 
a clinical history of acquired haemophilia and 14 presented for the first time. 
The initial dose of Obizur was 200U/kg infused intravenously at a rate of 1 to 2 mL/min. Variability in 
peak factor VIII activity levels in the first 24 hours was found. This suggests that it may be necessary 
to give a standard dose for initial treatment that leads to overdosing in some patients in order to 
ensure that all patients reach sufficient levels of factor VIII activity to treat the bleeding episode. The 
variability in peak factor VIII activity levels may be in part due to the cross-reactivity of the individual 
patient’s factor VIII antibodies with porcine factor. However, in the life-threatening, emergency 
situation of initial presentation, individual titration of posology will not be possible. 
The decision to administer additional Obizur doses was made by the investigator based on an 
assessment of the subject’s clinical response to treatment and trough FVIII activity. 
After an initial treatment phase to control bleeding, subjects entered into a healing phase during which 
Obizur was administered to maintain blood activity between 30 to 200%. 
Given the rarity of the condition of acquired haemophilia and the emergency nature of the presentation 
of patients, the design and conduct of the study are considered acceptable. 
The company was recommended to continue validation of the one stage clotting assay for factor VIII 
activity on a Sysmex CA-7000 instrument in post-approval (see also clinical pharmacology). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The loading dose used in the main study OBI-1-301 was derived from study OBI-1-201. In this phase 
II trial subjects with congenital haemophilia and inhibitor to human FVIII were treated with pFVIII. The 
loading  dose  proved  to  be  of  limited  value  in  that  study.  However,  20  bleeds  out  of  25  (80%)  were 
controlled with one treatment dose (including the loading dose if applicable) with the median dose of 
200.8 U/kg. Due to this finding the Applicant proposed this loading dose for the study OBI-1-301. The 
CHMP scientific advice regarding the initial fixed dose infusion of 200 U/kg of recombinant pFVIII was 
that the proposed strategy can be justified and acceptable. 
All initial bleeding episodes had a positive response to treatment at 24 hours after initial dosing as 
assessed by the primary investigator. A positive response was one where bleeding had stopped or was 
reduced, with clinical improvement or with Factor VIII activity above a pre-specified target.   
The primary clinical efficacy endpoint was the proportion of serious bleeding episodes responsive to 
Obizur therapy at 24 hours after the initiation of treatment based on assessment of clinical

effectiveness and FVIII blood activity. A positive response was defined as the investigator’s 
assessment that Obizur was effective or partially effective on both 3-point and 4-point scales [the 
company has been requested to clarify why it chose to use a 3-point scale for some patients].  All 
subjects were judged by the investigators to have a positive response to Obizur at 24 hours after 
initiation of treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was met in this study.  In OBI-1-301 + OBI-1-
301a: all 29 subjects had a positive response to recombinant pFVIII at 24 hours after initiation of 
treatment (100%, 95% CI:88.1-100). 
A positive response was observed in 95% (19/20) of subjects evaluated at 8 hours and 100% (18/18) 
at 16 hours. In addition to response to treatment, the overall treatment success was determined by 
the investigator based on his/her ability to discontinue or reduce the dose and/or dosing frequency of 
OBIZUR. A total of 24/28 (86%) had successful control (resolution) of the initial bleeding episode. Of 
those subjects treated with OBIZUR as first-line therapy, defined as no immediate previous use of anti-
haemorrhagic agents prior to the first OBIZUR treatment, 16/17 (94%) had eventual treatment 
success reported. Eleven subjects were reported to have received anti-haemorrhagic agents (eg. 
rFVIIa, activated prothrombin-complex concentrate, tranexamic acid) prior to first treatment with 
OBIZUR. Of these 11 subjects, eight had eventual successful treatment (73%). 
The median dose per injection to successfully treat the primary bleed was 133 U/kg and the median 
total dose was 1523 U/kg for a median of 6 days. The median number of daily infusions per subject 
was 1.76 (range: 0.2 to 5.6). In the initial 24 hour period, the median total dose of 493 U/kg were 
utilized in the clinical study with a median of 3 infusions. When treatment was required beyond 24 
hours, a median total dose of 1050 U/kg were utilized with a median of 10.5 infusions (median dose 
100 U/kg) to control a bleeding episode. 
Results from the secondary and other analyses were also in line with the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Qualifying bleeding events treated with Obizur were judged by the investigator to have been controlled 
successfully in 25 subjects at the time of final treatment dosing or progression to healing-phase 
dosing. The response of patients was highly variable: 1 patient required only 3 infusions whilst another 
required 38. 
The company has submitted a case series of 29 patients with acquired haemophilia to support the 
application. Currently advised posology is an initial dose of 200 U/kg.  Also, in the first day of 
treatment, referred to as the 'initial phase' by the company, study OBI-1-301 submitted by the 
company recommended a trough factor VIII activity of >80% for moderate and severe bleeds and 
>50% factor VIII activity for mild bleeds. 
Once bleeding had responded, usually within the first 24 hours, study OBI-1-301 protocol advised "a 
dose of Obizur that maintained the trough FVIII activity at 30-40% until bleeding is controlled. The 
maximum blood FVIII activity must not exceed 200%". 
Hyate:C was porcine factor VIII, withdrawn from the marketplace in 2004 because of concerns of 
possible presence of transmissible agents. Hyate:C was indicated for "....bleeding in patients with 
inhibitory antibodies to human factor VIII:C....". The recommended starting dose of Hyate:C was 25-
50U/kg (and up to 100U/kg in the presence of high antibody titre for anti-porcine factor VIII). 
Phase 1 and 2 studies for Obizur have demonstrated similar pharmacokinetics of Obizur to Hyate:C. 
Additional consultations with expert groups 
The CHMP referred the posology discussion to the BPWP for the following reasons: 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 64/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
In the first 24hrs of treatment, 7/29 patients had a peak factor VIII activity of 400-700%, 
17/29 patients had a peak factor VIII activity of 200-400% and 5/29 patients had a peak 
factor VIII activity of <200%. There is concern that the factor VIII activities achieved are 
higher than required and that this may predispose to thrombo-embolic phenomena. The BPWP 
is requested to comment on the initial dosage and the factor VIII activities achieved. 
BPWP considers that there is a need for this product in the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients 
with acquired haemophilia caused by antibodies to factor VIII. BPWP noted the variability seen in peak 
factor VIII activity levels in the first 24 hours. This suggests that it may be necessary to give a 
standard dose for initial treatment that leads to overdosing in some patients in order to ensure that all 
patients reach sufficient levels of factor VIII activity to treat the bleeding episode. The variability in 
peak factor VIII activity levels may be in part due to the cross-reactivity of the individual patient’s 
factor VIII antibodies with porcine factor. However, in the life-threatening, emergency situation of 
initial presentation, individual titration of posology will not be possible. Nevertheless, there are safety 
concerns given the very high factor VIII activity levels seen in patients. Therefore, the SmPC should 
emphasise the limited experience with the recommended posology and the potential risk of 
thromboembolic ADRs. The elderly should be highlighted as particularly at risk. Further information on 
safety should be collected in the post-authorisation phase. 
It does not seem possible at this stage to recommend use of a lower initial dosage since the clinical 
data is based on the posology proposed by the Company.  
•  After the first 24hrs and during the 'healing phase' of treatment, 1/29 patients had a peak 
factor VIII activity of 400-700%, 6/29 patients had a peak factor VIII activity of 200-400% 
and 22/29 patients had a peak factor VIII activity of <200%. The BPWP is requested to 
comment on the dosages advised in the 'healing phase'. 
BPWP agreed with the proposal already made to the Company that lower dosages should be proposed 
in the ‘healing phase’ together with individual assessment by the treating physician. BPWP considered 
that it would be important to repeat FVIII activity measurements in the healing phase and adjust the 
dosage accordingly due to the risk of thromboembolic ADRs from high FVIII activity levels. 
BPWP noted that if the product receives a positive opinion, it is likely to be under exceptional 
circumstances with annual review. BPWP considered this appropriate given the limited clinical data and 
the safety concerns. 
The current posology would result in a 70kg subject being administered (about) 120 vials of Obizur 
over 24hrs. Concerns have been raised over the potential for incorrect counting of vials and over the 
amount of host cell protein that would be administered to patients (see RMP). The applicant received 
recommendation to develop an improved pharmaceutical strength/ formulation that would require less 
vials. 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015

The Applicant will carry out a prospective, non-interventional study to evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of Obizur in real life practice, including measurement of immunogenicity (levels of anti-
pFVIII antibodies and any associated clinical manifestations) (see RMP). 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
1.  To collect and analyse immediate and long-term data on clinical efficacy and safety of all 
patients with acquired haemophilia and who are treated with Obizur, the MAH must conduct a 
surveillance programme/ registry according to an agreed protocol and for an indefinite time. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Data submitted by the company suggest that Obizur bears clinical efficacy in the management of 
bleeding that is life and / or limb threatening in patients with acquired haemophilia. As it is difficult to 
assess the severity of the bleeding in a patient, the indication “Treatment of bleeding episodes  in 
patients with acquired haemophilia caused by antibodies to Factor VIII”  can be justified, while the 
clinician should balance the decision to treat a patient with the limited available data with the repeated 
use of Obizur.   
Further experience of use of susoctocog alfa in the management of patients with acquired haemophilia 
will be obtained in a post-approval registry. 
The company will pursue further validation of the one stage clotting assay for factor VIII activity post-
approval. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a MA under exceptional circumstances: 
• 
To collect and analyse immediate and long-term data on clinical efficacy and safety of all

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
This application includes safety data from a total of 42 subjects exposed to Obizur between 15 April 
2003 and 09 October 2013 in 3 clinical trials.  
A summary of overall extent of exposure is shown in the following table: 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 66/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall exposure in study OBI-1-301 is also shown in the following table: 
The dosing and overall exposure were highly variable because dose was based on factor VIII activity 
and clinical assessment. In addition to the 29 unique qualifying bleeding events, 3 serious bleeding 
events subsequent to the qualifying bleed that were treated with Obizur (data are included in the 
above table). The cumulative exposure to treat the qualifying bleed only was 1,637.0 U/kg (median, 
range: 100 to 20,660 U/kg). 
Adverse events 
Safety data are presented for 42 subjects treated with Obizur. The safety evaluation plans were similar 
across the clinical studies and included assessments of medical history and concomitant medications, 
physical examinations, clinical observations, clinical laboratory measurements, vital signs, blood 
coagulation tests, factor VIII activity, anti-human factor VIII antibody titres, anti-porcine factor VIII 
antibody titres, anti-baby hamster kidney cell antibody titres and evaluations of bleeding and adverse 
events. 
In Study OBI-1-301 and its expanded access program, Study OBI-1-301a, non-qualifying and 
subsequent serious bleeding events not considered a continuation of the initial bleeding event were 
considered adverse events. 
In Study OBI-1-301/301a, events were considered continuations of the initial bleed in the following 
circumstances: 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 67/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Bleeding that occurred at the site of the qualifying bleeding event after initially successful 
haemostasis and before 2 weeks after the last Obizur dose. 
•  Bleeding events that occurred at another anatomical site before 1 week after the last Obizur 
dose. 
Clinical assessment of the bleed site followed the same parameters as were assessed for the initial 
bleeding events. 
All subsequent serious bleeding events were recorded as adverse events. 
All treatments, assessments and outcomes were fully documented for the subsequent bleeding events 
that were documented for the qualifying bleeding event. 
The follow-up visit schedule was based on the final Obizur dose, regardless of whether for the 
qualifying bleed or a subsequent bleed. 
A summary of the treatment emergent adverse events from each study is shown in the following table: 
Safety data was not integrated owing to the differences in study populations, bleed state, severity and 
dosing regimen. Instead, safety data are summarised for each study. 
Study OBI-1-301/301a 
In Study OBI-1-301/301a, a total of 264 treatment emergent adverse events were reported by 27 of 
29 subjects. 
Most treatment emergent adverse events were mild (50.4%) or moderate (37.9%) in severity.  
The most frequently reported mild treatment emergent adverse events included: constipation (2.7%), 
diarrhoea (2.3%) and oedema peripheral (2.3%), nausea (1.5%) and insomnia (1.9%).  
The most frequently reported moderate treatment emergent adverse events included constipation 
(1.1%), pneumonia (1.1%), muscle haemorrhage (1.1%), hypertension (1.1%), hypokalaemia 
(3.0%), and pyrexia (1.5%).  
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 68/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severe treatment emergent adverse events were reported in 6 subjects and included abdominal pain 
(0.8%), constipation (0.8%), hypocalcaemia (0.8%) and joint swelling (0.8%). 
Relatedness of adverse events 
7 non-serious treatment emergent adverse events considered by the investigator as related to Obizur 
were reported in 6 subjects.  
Related treatment emergent adverse events were all mild or moderate in severity and all completely 
resolved except for one instance of a positive anti-porcine inhibitor which was ongoing as of study 
completion.  
•  One subject had mild hypotension and constipation which all completely resolved. 
•  One subject had 2 instances of central catheter line occlusion which completely resolved. 
•  One subject had a mild hypofibrinogenaemia which completely resolved. 
•  One subject experienced a mental status change. 
• 
Two subjects developed anti-susoctocog alfaantibodies and were discontinued from treatment, 
however both subjects had a positive response to treatment at the 24 hour primary endpoint 
assessment. 
The sponsor has reviewed the investigator-assessed related adverse events: the two incidences of 
anti-porcine inhibitors are considered related to susoctocog alfa treatment with all others unlikely 
related to susoctocog alfa treatment. 
Information on blockage of in-dwelling venous catheters and pre-disposition towards thromboembolic 
disease in those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and the elderly is proposed for the PI texts 
based on experience of raised factor VIII activities in these patient-groups. 
Study OBI-1-201 
Eighteen (18) adverse events were categorised as treatment emergent. The most frequently reported 
were haemorrhagic disorder and haemarthrosis: none led to treatment interruption or discontinuation 
from the study. 
Study OBI-1-101 
There were 10 adverse events, all considered unrelated to the current product. All adverse events 
resolved. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Study OBI-1-301/301a 
Thirty three (33) treatment emergent serious adverse events (including 8 treatment emergent serious 
adverse events leading to death) were reported in 13 (44.8%) subjects. Twenty eight (28) of the 
Treatment emergent serious adverse events were judged by the investigator to be unrelated to study 
drug and 5 were judged as probably not related / remotely related; all but one resolved during the 
study. The one subject who experienced an on-going treatment emergent serious adverse event was 
diagnosed with and received treatment for atrial fibrillation. 
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015

Pneumonia, reported in 3 (10.3%) subjects, was the most frequently reported treatment emergent 
serious adverse event followed by sepsis, reported in 2 (6.9%) subjects. 
For studies OBI-1-301 and OBI-1-201 combined: the most common treatment emergent serious 
adverse events by system organ class were “infections and infestations” reported in 7 subjects 
(16.3%) followed by “musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” observed in subjects (14.0%) 
and “nervous system disorders” reported in 5 subjects (11.6%). No treatment emergent serious 
adverse events were considered related to Obizur treatment. 
There were not any treatment emergent serious adverse events for Study OBI-1-101. 
A summary of serious adverse events in Obizur studies is shown in the following table: 
Deaths 
Five (5) deaths occurred during study OBI-1-301 and 2 subjects died after discontinuing from the 
study.  
Assessment Report EMA/627966/2015 
Obizur 
Page 70/82 
 
 
 
 
 
Three (3) deaths were attributed to serious bleeding (2 intracranial haemorrhages, 1 intestinal), 2 
deaths were attributed to infection, 1 death was attributed to infection and cholangitis and 1 death was 
attributed to renal failure. All deaths that were observed during or after the study were a result of 
subject’s clinical condition which includes consequences of immunosuppressive therapy and co-
morbidities. The treatment emergent serious adverse events leading to death were considered not 
related to the current product in 5 cases and probably not / remotely related to the current product in 
2 cases of intracranial haemorrhage. 
There were not any deaths in studies OBI-1-201 and OBI-1-101. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Abnormal haematology laboratory results were observed in all subjects in Study OBI-1-301: these 
results were consistent with the subjects’ underlying diseases and all resolved. 
Clinical Chemistry 
Abnormal clinical chemistry laboratory results were observed in all subjects in Study OBI-1-301 with 
no specific patterns of abnormal chemistry results. 
Urinalysis 
Overall, there were no significant abnormal urinalysis results or any specific patterns of abnormal 
urinalysis results in the clinical studies. 
Immunological events 
Anti OBI-1 antibodies 
Presence of anti-Obizur antibodies with titres above 20BU was an exclusion criterion in Study OBI-1-
301. 
Ten (10) out of 28 eligible subjects had a detectable anti-Obizur inhibitor titre at baseline (range: 0.8-
29 BU), yet all subjects had a positive response to treatment.  
After dosing, 8 of these subjects had no detectable anti-porcine inhibitor titre (titre <0.6BU at the last 
reported result) and an increase in titre was observed in 2 subjects.  
Eighteen (18) out of 28 eligible subjects did not have a detectable anti-Obizur inhibitor titre at 
baseline. 
Twelve (120 of these subjects had no detectable anti-Obizur titre after dosing; 5 subjects had newly 
developed anti-porcine factor VIII antibodies (inhibitors) after treatment (range: 0.6-108 BU) and 1 
subject had no post-treatment measurements. 
In 2 of the 5 subjects with increased anti-porcine factor VIII antibodies levels, inhibitor development 
was assessed as a related non-serious adverse event and the subjects were discontinued from the 
study. 
Anti-baby hamster kidney protein antibodies 
Binding antibodies against baby hamster kidney protein were measured using a direct binding enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay. In Study OBI-1-301, 1 subject had a positive titre prior to treatment 
only; no anti-baby hamster kidney antibodies were detected in any subjects treated with OBI-1.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Study OBI-1-301 / OBI-1-301a, 3 (10.3%) patients experienced treatment emergent adverse 
events that resulted in withdrawal.  
• 
• 
• 
Patient with intracranial bleeds was administered 3 infusions of the current product over 2 
days. The third infusion had technical problems, factor VIII was assayed at 50%, there was a 
further intracranial bleed and infusions were stopped, the patient died shortly after. 
Patient with anti-human factor VIII antibodies at 26BU, presented with planned surgery for 
hemi-colectomy. This subject developed a positive anti–Obizur antibody titres of 8BU (in 
association with anti-human factor VIII antibodies now at 128BU) leading to discontinuation 
and starting rescue therapy with by-pass agents. The patient experienced an intestinal 
haemorrhage and died shortly afterwards.  
Patient presented with bleeding after a surgical procedure. Anti-human factor VIII antibodies 
were 24BU at screening. About 3 weeks after an initial bleed was treated, there was a second 
major bleed into the retroperitoneal space for which the subject was initially treated with 
Obizur but was found to have anti–Obizur antibody titres of22BU leading to discontinuation. 
As a result of these discontinuations, a clarification was made to the Study Procedures Manual to 
indicate that anti-Obizur antibody titres were to be considered an adverse event but were not 
mandatory grounds for discontinuation from treatment with Obizur.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data reported by the company pertains mainly to study OBI-1-301/301a, the study of 
patients with acquired haemophilia. Study 301 was a non-comparator, non-placebo, non-randomised, 
open label, observational study. Patients enrolled in the study were mainly elderly and with many 
clinical pathologies present before exposure to study medication. Patients presented in extremis with 
haemorrhage that was a threat to limb and / or life.  
The size of the patient database from study 301 is small (only 29 patients exposed to study medication 
in study 301, a case series report) but this may be understood in the context of a rare disease. 
Problems associated with the open label design should also be seen in this context. 
There were not any unexpected signals detected by study 301. The company reports only the 
development of antibodies to Obizur as related to study medication. There were not any reports of 
anaphylaxis.  
Obizur appears to be acceptably safe and well-tolerated both in the management of acute bleeding 
episodes of acquired haemophilia and in prophylaxis management prior to surgery. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials (Investigations; positive 
test for inhibitory antibodies against porcine Factor VIII;)  have been included in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics section 4.8 as frequency: Common.  
Inhibitory antibodies against porcine Factor VIII (measured using a modification of the Nijmegen 
variation of the Bethesda assay) were detected before and after exposure to OBIZUR. Inhibitor titres of 
up to 29 Bethesda units were recorded at baseline yet subjects responded positively to OBIZUR. It is 
recommended that treatment should be based on clinical judgement and not based on detection of 
inhibitory antibodies by the Bethesda assay. 
OBIZUR is produced by recombinant DNA technology in baby hamster kidney cells. Antibodies to baby 
hamster kidney cell protein were not detected in subjects after exposure to OBIZUR. 
High and sustained factor VIII activity in blood may predispose to thromboembolic events. Those with 
pre-existing cardiovascular disease and the elderly are at particular risk. 
If a venous access is required, then risk of catheter site thrombosis should be considered.

Factor VIII activity determined by the chromogenic assay is generally lower than Factor VIII activity 
determined by the one-stage clotting assay. Measurement of Factor VIII activity must always be 
carried out using the same assay methodology on any one patient. The one-stage assay is 
recommended because it has been used in determination of the potency and the mean recovery rate of 
Obizur (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Furthermore it is described that Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, 
burning and stinging at the injection site, chills, flushing, generalized urticaria, headache, hives, 
hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, 
wheezing) are possible and may progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock) (see section 4.4 ).  
The applicant will further investigate validation of laboratory assays of immunogenicity post-approval. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the safety under normal conditions of use could not be generated, the CHMP 
considers the following specific obligation necessary to address the missing safety data in the context 
of a MA under exceptional circumstances:  
• 
To collect and analyse immediate and long-term data on clinical efficacy and safety of all 
patients with acquired haemophilia and who are treated with Obizur, the MAH must conduct a 
surveillance programme/ registry according to an agreed protocol and for an indefinite time. 
2.6.1.   Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The extent and nature of the available safety data, though limited, support a marketing authorisation 
for Obizur. Aspects of clinical safety that have given rise to concern such as the risk of thromboembolic 
events in response to raised factor VIII blood activity are addressed in the PI texts and risk 
management plan. Further information on clinical safety will be gained from a post-approval registry.  
The CHMP has recommended that the company will complete validation of laboratory assays of 
immunogenicity post-approval. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring  
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Obizur (susoctocog alfa) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is approved under exceptional circumstances.   
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In a prospective, non-randomised, open-label trial of 28 subjects, all initial bleeding episodes had a 
positive response to treatment at 24 hours after initial dosing as assessed by the primary investigator. 
In addition to response to treatment, the overall treatment success was determined by the investigator 
based on his/her ability to discontinue or reduce the dose and/or dosing frequency of OBIZUR. A total 
of 24/28 (86%) had successful control (resolution) of the initial bleeding episode. Of those subjects 
treated with OBIZUR as first-line therapy, defined as no immediate previous use of anti-haemorrhagic 
agents prior to the first OBIZUR treatment, 16/17 (94%) had eventual treatment success reported. 
Eleven subjects were reported to have received anti-haemorrhagic agents (eg. rFVIIa, activated 
prothrombin-complex concentrate, tranexamic acid) prior to first treatment with OBIZUR. Of these 11 
subjects, eight had eventual successful treatment (73%). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The design of the study (open-label, single-cohort, non-randomised) and use of clinical judgement (as 
opposed to an objective measurement) to assess the primary endpoint (albeit coupled to a 3- or 4-
point scale) are known to be susceptible to bias, however due to the rarity of the population and the 
nature of the condition, these weaknesses are acknowledged and moreover the magnitude of the effect 
is reassuring. Further data on clinical efficacy of all patients with acquired haemophilia and who are 
treated with Obizur, will be provided through the surveillance programme and registry according to an 
agreed protocol. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Inhibitory antibodies against porcine Factor VIII  were detected before and after exposure to OBIZUR. 
Inhibitor titres of up to 29 Bethesda units were recorded at baseline yet subjects responded positively 
to OBIZUR. It is recommended that treatment should be based on clinical judgement and not based on 
detection of inhibitory antibodies.  
High and sustained Factor VIII activity in blood may predispose to thromboembolic events. Those with 
pre-existing cardiovascular disease and the elderly are at particular risk. Patients experiencing a 
thromboembolic event as a result of exposure to Obizur (or at least this cannot be excluded by data 
available) is suspected in 2 cases and has been addressed by appropriate warnings in section 4.4 of 
the SPC text. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The initial dose of 200 U/kg Obizur in some patients may lead to a high blood factor VIII activity, but 
as described is acceptable. Follow-on dosages are based on target factor VIII activities (it is 
recommended to assay factor VIII by the one stage clotting assay) and on clinical judgement. 
It is not fully known how patients will respond immunologically to a second exposure to Obizur, though 
some patients in study OBI-1-301/301a were treated for second episodes of bleeding apparently with 
no concerns. Further aspects of immunogenicity will be pursued post-approval (see RMP).

Study 301 was a non-comparative, non-randomised, open label, observational study in an elderly 
population with many co-morbidities. It is considered that the design of the study and the nature of 
the population studied would hinder detection of adverse events unless the adverse events were 
striking in nature and / or commonly found.  
Long-term data on clinical safety of all patients with acquired haemophilia and who are treated with 
Obizur, will be provided through the surveillance programme/ registry according to an agreed protocol. 
There is concern that the large number of vials needed per infusion or per day may lead to mistakes in 
dosage administered. This will be addressed with appropriate educational material as agreed in the 
RMP.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Patients with acquired haemophilia and who present with bleeding that threatens life and / or limb are 
seriously ill and in need of urgent, specialist attention. The ability of susoctocog alfa to stop or reduce 
bleeding could potentially be life and limb saving and is of utmost importance. 
The unfavourable effect of the development of inhibitory antibodies susoctocog alfa is of uncertain 
significance and has to be further investigated in the planned registry as part of on an ongoing safety 
evaluation. Any problems that may arise because of the large number of vials needed per infusion will 
be managed by suitable risk minimisation activity and even eliminated in the future as the company 
was recommended to consider developing an improved pharmaceutical formulation/ strength that 
would require less vials.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The ability of susoctocog to stop or reduce severe bleeding far outweighs the apparent development of 
inhibitory antibodies to the product, which were of uncertain significance in studies in vivo and will be 
studied further in post authorisation studies agreed. 
Educational material will provide instructions to the user to help minimise the risk of medication 
associated with handling of the large number of vials that may be needed per infusion. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Apart from the so-called by-passing agents, there are no medicinal products in the EU specifically 
intended for the treatment of acquired haemophilia, a rare condition which may result in potentially 
life-threatening bleeding problems.  
Therefore, there is currently a clear unmet medical need for treatment of patients in terms of providing 
sufficient coagulation by means of a high-purity recombinant factor VIII drug product.  
In the main clinical study all patients with serious bleeding episodes treated with Obizur responded 
positively at 24 hours after the initiation of susoctocog treatment. The absence of the potential to 
transmit porcine viruses or human blood-borne pathogens is of significance to patients. Measurable 
factor VIII activity levels permit guidance of dose and dose frequency after the initial susoctocog 
administration. These benefits outweigh the risk of potential hypersensitivity reactions and Obizur 
immunogenicity in patients with AHA. As the adverse effects of inhibitor formation and risk of 
thromboembolic events are well identified and expected, the benefit sufficiently outweighs the risks.

Management of patients is based on the assumption of continued bleeding: it is not known and cannot 
be anticipated if or when any one patient may spontaneously stop bleeding and moreover the severity 
of the bleeding may not be possible to be estimated prior to treatment initiation. On the other hand 
there is a lack of clinical information on the development of inhibitory antibodies to OBIZUR following 
repeated administration. Therefore, Obizur must only be administered when considered clinically 
necessary, as per physician’s clinical judgement, this information is reflected in the SmPC. The benefit 
/ risk balance may change over time in any one patient if that patient develops an immunological 
reaction to susoctocog alfa and requires repeated treatments for bleeding. Benefit may decline if 
neutralising antibodies are developed whilst risk will increase if sensitisation takes place. It is advised 
that a scheme is established to monitor clinical progress in patients who need repeated treatment for 
bleeds. A clinical registry of recipients will be undertaken to provide further information on clinical 
efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Obizur. 
Thus, the Applicant will carry out a prospective, non-interventional study to evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of Obizur in real life practice, including measurement of immunogenicity (levels of anti-
pFVIII antibodies and any associated clinical manifestations) (see RMP). 
The company has applied for a MA under exceptional circumstances based on a case series of 28 
patients treated with Obizur for the management of acquired haemophilia. The rarity of acquired 
haemophilia being an impediment for the applicant to provide comprehensive data justifies a licence to 
be granted under exceptional circumstances. Moreover there is a clear unmet medical need for a 
treatment specifically developed for acquired haemophilia. 
The arguments put forward by the applicant to justify the criteria of a marketing authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances on the grounds of inability to provide comprehensive safety and efficacy 
data due to rarity of the indication –as set out in Part II.6 of Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC such 
authorisation are acknowledged. In view of the above the CHMP concluded that a positive benefit/risk 
balance for Obizur has been established and recommends the grant of a marketing authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances subject to the obligations laid down in the annex II of the opinion. 
Continuation of the authorisation shall be linked to the annual reassessment of the specific conditions 
introduced.

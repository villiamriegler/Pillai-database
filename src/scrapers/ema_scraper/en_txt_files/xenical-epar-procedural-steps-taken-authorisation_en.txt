Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The procedure started on 2 January 1997. 
The Rapporteur's first assessment report was circulated to all CPMP Members on 28 February 
1997.  The  Co-Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on 
28 February 1997. 
During the February CPMP meeting, it was agreed to perform a GMP inspection on the Swiss 
manufacturing  site  for  the  finished  medicinal  product  (i.e.  F  Hoffman-La  Roche  Ltd, 
Grenzacherstrasse, Basel). 
During  the  April  1997  meeting,  the  CPMP  agreed  on  the  consolidated  list  of  questions  to  be 
sent  to  the  company.  The  final  consolidated  list  of  questions  was  sent  to  the  Company  on 
17 April 1997. 
The  company  submitted  the  responses  to  the  consolidated  list  of  questions  on  10  September 
1997.  
The  Rapporteur  and  Co-Rapporteur  circulated  the  joint  assessment  report  on  the  company’s 
responses to the list of questions to all CPMP Members on 24 October 1997. 
During  the  November  1997  meeting,  the  CPMP  decided  to  have  a  hearing  to  address  the 
remaining  outstanding  safety  issues:  efficacy  (label  recommendations  for  selection  of 
responders), lipid soluble vitamin deficiencies, steatorrhoea and the risk of colon cancer, risk of 
breast cancer (relationship to treatment, sex hormone level) and the overall benefit/risk ratio. 
Following the hearing, the CPMP considered on 16 December 1997 that further information on 
issues  relating  to  breast  cancer,  colon  cancer,  bone  mineral  density  and  efficacy  (best  way  to 
select  responders  using  ITT  analysis)  should  be  provided  by  the  company  prior  to  the 
finalisation  of  the  opinion.  The  list  of  additional  issues  to  be  addressed  by  the  company  in 
writing was adopted by the CPMP and the clock was subsequently stopped. 
The Rapporteur circulated to all CPMP Members, on 11 March 1998, an assessment report on 
the company’s responses to the additional issues. 
During the  meeting on 23-25 March 1998, the company was requested to give additional oral 
presentation addressing the responders’ analysis and the review of breast cancer. Amendments 
were discussed to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
The  company  provided  a  letter  of  undertaking  on  the  follow-up  measures  to  be  fulfilled  as 
requested by the CPMP, dated 24 March 1998.

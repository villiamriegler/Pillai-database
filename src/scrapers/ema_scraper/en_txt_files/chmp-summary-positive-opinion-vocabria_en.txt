Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Vocabria 
cabotegravir 
On 15 October 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Vocabria 
intended for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in combination with 
rilpivirine injection.  
The applicant for this medicinal product is ViiV Healthcare B.V. 
Vocabria will be available as film-coated tablets (30 mg) and as a prolonged-release suspension for 
injection (400 and 600 mg). The active substance of Vocabria is cabotegravir, a direct- acting antiviral 
(ATC code: J05AJ04) known as an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INI). Cabotegravir inhibits HIV 
integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. Vocabria is to be 
used in combination with Rekambys (rilpivirine), another long-acting antiretroviral.  
The benefits with Vocabria used in combination with Rekambys are its formulation and delivery (as a 
prolonged-release suspension for injection) which reduce dosing frequency to once a month or every two 
months compared with daily oral antiretrovirals. A reduced dosing schedule may increase patient 
satisfaction and compliance.  
The most common side effects observed in clinical trials for this regimen (Vocabria plus Rekambys) were 
injection site reactions followed by headache, pyrexia, nausea, fatigue, asthenia, myalgia and dizziness. 
In addition, there could be a risk of emergence of resistance associated with this long-acting regimen 
when it is not used correctly or not adhered to. Some measures have been put in place to minimise this 
risk (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
The full indication is: 
“Vocabria injection is indicated, in combination with rilpivirine injection, for the treatment of 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically 
suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past 
evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI

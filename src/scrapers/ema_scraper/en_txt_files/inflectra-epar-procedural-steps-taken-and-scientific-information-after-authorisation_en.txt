Submission of the final clinical study report for

n/a 
This study had been used as a data source to investigate 
C1231001 (CONNECT-IBD)  study; a non-
interventional study designated as a Post 
Authorisation Safety Study conducted voluntarily to 
capture data from real-world clinical practice to 
characterise the population and document drug 
utilisation patterns. In addition, available safety data 
and data on the effectiveness of CT-P13  in the 
context of standard of care utilisation of Remicade 
(reference medicinal product) was collected in 
patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. 
C.I.13  - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
the long-term safety and effectiveness in inflammatory 
bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) with 
emphasis on TB and other serious infection. While the 
inherent limitations exist in relation to group size, selection 
bias within each treatment group (CT-P13  vs Remicade) 
and sub-group size (UC vs CD) for any comparisons, the 
study confirmed that the safety profiles for each treatment 
group were consistent with the expected safety profile of 
infliximab and did not identify any new safety risk.

Submission of the final clinical study report for 
17/04/2020 
n/a 
No new safety information was identified from the 
C1231002 (PERSIST)  study, an observational cohort 
study designed to evaluate real life drug persistence 
in biologic naive rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing 
spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis patients receiving 
CT-P13 or those switched to CT-P13 from stable 
treatment with Remicade (reference medicinal 
product). 
C.I.13  - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
submitted data. This study was listed as EU RMP  in order to 
further characterise the safety profile of CT -P13 including 
long-term safety and Important identified risks: serious 
infections including sepsis (initially including tuberculosis), 
demyelinating disorders and malignancy but there was a 
small sample size resulting from early study termination. 
The most frequent treatment related adverse drug 
reactions of serious infections and infusion reactions are 
already adequately addressed in the Product Information. 
No meaningful information on demyelinating disorders and 
malignancy were identified. The CHMP stressed that the 
submitted results were limited, however, cconsidering the 
totality of the safety data available for CT-P13  and the

was consistent with the known safety profile of Remicade; 
there were no new or unexpected safety findings observed 
in this study and no update to the product information was

integrated the RMPs into a single RMP covering both

The proposed post-authorisation pharmacovigilance 
development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise 
the risks of the product. There are no changes to the 
routine and additional risk minimisation measures as a 
consequence of the integration of the separate RMPs to

elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
showed that Cmax values were comparable in groups after 
Doses 1, 2 and 3 with a spike in Cmax in both treatment 
groups at Dose 2 (Week 2). CT-P13 showed a 
pharmacodynamic profile that is similar to Remicade. The 
trial is too small to draw any conclusions on the efficacy 
and safety of CT-P13 relative to the reference product. The 
results with respect to efficacy and safety variables in this 
study do not, however, provide grounds to reconsider the 
conclusions drawn to date on the therapeutic similarity of 
CT-P13 and the reference product.

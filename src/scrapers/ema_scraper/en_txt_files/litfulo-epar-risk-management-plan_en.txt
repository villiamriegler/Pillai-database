Brief description of the product:
Chemical class
Janus kinase (JAK) 3 and tyrosine kinase expressed in 
hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase family inhibitor.
Summary of mode of action
Ritlecitinib irreversibly and selectively inhibits Janus kinase 
(JAK) 3 and the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular 
carcinoma (TEC) family by blocking the adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) binding site.
In cellular settings, ritlecitinib specifically inhibits γ-common 
cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-15 and IL-21) signalling through 
JAK3-dependent common-γ chain receptors. 
Additionally, ritlecitinib inhibits TEC family of kinases, 
resulting in reduced cytolytic activity of NK cells and CD8+ T 
cells. 
JAK3 and TEC family mediated signalling pathways are both 
involved in alopecia areata pathogenesis, although complete 
pathophysiology is still not understood.
Important information about its composition:
Excipient-Lactose monohydrate 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, 
total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption 
should not take this medicinal product.

PART II. SAFETY SPECIFICATION
July 2023
Module SI. Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population (s)
Litfulo is indicated for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adults and adolescents 12 
years of age and older. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that has an underlying 
immuno-inflammatory pathogenesis and is characterised by nonscarring hair loss ranging 
from small patches to complete scalp, face, and/or body hair loss.1
Epidemiological Literature Search Strategy 
The United States (US) National Library of Medicine PubMed database was searched for 
literature reporting the incidence, prevalence, and demographic profile of AA from 1 January 
2011 through 18 October 2021. Article titles were restricted to human populations, 
observational data, and the English language. Potentially relevant abstracts were reviewed by 
epidemiologists, and articles were excluded if they reported exclusively on clinical trial 
participants or were case reports.
Incidence: 
Europe
A meta-analysis including articles published up to 01 September 2018 calculated the overall 
pooled incidence of AA in Europe as 4.92% (95% Confidence interval [CI] 2.41-8.25%).2 In 
a separate study in the United Kingdom (UK), the incidence rate of AA was reported to be 
2.6 per 10,000 person-years.3
US
A meta-analysis including articles published up to 01 September 2018 calculated the overall 
pooled incidence of AA in North America as 0.54% (95% CI 0.27-0.91%).2 In the US, a 
2014 study reported the age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate of AA as 2.1 per 10,000 person-
years, and the cumulative lifetime incidence as 2.1%.4 A study in the Nurses’ Health Study 
(NHS) and NHS II reported the lifetime incidence of AA to be 0.76%.5
China
No China specific data was found on the incidence of AA.
RoW
A meta-analysis including articles published up to September 1, 2018 calculated the overall 
pooled incidence of AA in Asia as 1.92% (95% CI 0.66-3.83%).2 Population-based data from 
Korea showed that between 2006 and 2015 the incidence rate of AA ranged between 19.3 
and 20.6 per 10,000 person-years.6 A separate study in South Korea found that the incidence 
rate in persons without a family history of AA was 10.0 per 10,000 person-years.7

SI.1. Prevalence
July 2023
Europe
The pooled prevalence of AA was estimated at 0.58% (95% CI 0.49-0.66%) in Europe.2 In 
France, a population-based study using a representative sample of the French general 
population over 15 years old reported an age and sex-standardised overall point prevalence of 
AA of 1.05% (95% CI 0.92-1.20%).8 In the UK, a population-based cohort study of 4.16 
million adults and children reported an AA point prevalence of 0.58%.3
US
In the US, the overall prevalence of AA has been estimated as 2.47% (95% CI 2.05-2.94%).2
An online, cross-sectional survey with a representative sample of the US population reported
that the clinician-adjudicated point prevalence of AA was 0.21% (95% CI 0.17-0.25%) 
overall, 0.12% (95% CI 0.09-0.15%) for “mild” disease (≤50% Severity of Alopecia Tool  
[SALT] score), 0.09% (95% CI 0.06-0.11%) for “moderate to severe” disease (>50% SALT 
score), and 0.04% (95% CI 0.02-0.06%) for patients with alopecia totalis (AT)/alopecia 
universalis (AU).9 Self-reported lifetime prevalence in that study was 2.51% (95% CI: 2.37-
2.65%) overall.9
China
No China specific data was found on the incidence of AA.
RoW
In Asia, the pooled prevalence of AA was reported as 1.46% (95% CI 1.17-1.79%).2 A 
population-based study in South Korea estimated the point prevalence as 0.37% in 2015.6
SI.2. Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, racial 
and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease: 
Age and age of onset: Patients with AA are relatively young, with an average age of onset 
reported between 22 and 40 years.4,10,11,12,13,14 However, diagnosis can occur at any age.15 In 
a UK population, the annual incidence of AA peaked at 5.1 per 10,000 (males) and 4.3 per 
10,000 (females) in patients aged 25-29 and subsequently decreased with age.3 A population-
based study conducted between 1973-2011 in the Faroe Islands reported age- and sex-
specific incidence rates of AA (Table 1).15  In that study, the incidence rate of AA diagnosis 
was 0.8 per 10,000 person-years in the youngest age category (0-9 years), increased to 1.1 
per 10,000 person-years in patients 10-19 years, and peaked at 1.5 per 10,000 person-years in 
patients 20-29 years, before declining in subsequent age categories.15  A US study conducted 
among residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, reported a similar trend in age-specific 
incidence rates (Table 2).4 In that study, incidence rate of AA was 1.6 per 10,000 person-
years in the youngest age category (0-9 years), increased to 1.7 per 10,000 person-years in 
patients 10-19 years, and peaked at 3.0 per 10,000 person-years in patients 20-39 years, 
before declining in subsequent age categories.4

Race and ethnicity: A UK study reported that the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of AA was 
higher in Asian (IRR: 3.32, 95% CI 3.11-3.55), black (IRR 1.54; 95% CI 1.36-1.75), and 
mixed ethnicity (IRR 2.15; 95% CI 1.82, 2.54) patient populations, as compared to white 
patients.3 Similarly, in the US, a study in the NHS reported that the lifetime incidence of AA 
was higher in black females (1.66-4.07%) compared to white females (0.64-0.78%) and, in 
age-adjusted analyses, black, as compared with white women, had a greater lifetime 
incidence of AA (NHS: odds ratio [OR]: 2.72; 1.61-4.61; NHS II: OR: 5.48; 4.10-7.32).5
Confirming the findings from the NHS, a cross-sectional study of both men and women in 
the US from the National Alopecia Areata Registry, reported that the odds of AA was greater

in African Americans as compared to white Americans, after adjusting for age, gender, and 
comorbidities (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.77; 95% CI 1.37-2.28).20
Risk Factors: Family history may be a risk factor for developing AA. Indeed, a Korean 
study found that the incidence rate of AA in patients without a family history of AA was 10.0 
per 10,000 person-years vs 19.7 per 10,000 person-years in patients with a family history 
(IRR 1.98 [95% CI: 1.96-2.00]).7 Rates increasingly grew higher as the genetic similarity 
among first degree relatives increased (affected father vs. no family history [IRR: 1.77 (95% 
CI: 1.74-1.81)]; affected twin vs. no family history [IRR: 5.08 (95% CI: 4.52-5.70)]) and 
among patients with more than one affected first degree relative (IRR: 3.43 [95% CI: 3.29-
3.57]). 7 However, at least one other study did not identify a trend of higher rates of AA in 
first-degree family members as compared to second- and third-degree relatives.15
Risk of AA has been reported to increase after exposure to viral infections. For example, in a 
Taiwanese study, history of HPV infection was associated with the development of 
subsequent AA (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.55; 95% CI 1.88–3.47) after adjusting for sex, 
age, and comorbidities.21
AA often co-occurs with other autoimmune diseases and psychiatric disorders. For example, 
the relationship between AA and major depressive disorder (MDD) was found to be 
bidirectional, with MDD increasing the risk of subsequently developing AA by 90% (aHR 
1.90, 95% CI 1.67-2.15) and AA increasing the risk of developing MDD by 34% (aHR 1.34; 
95% CI 1.23-1.46).22
Deficiency of micronutrients have been linked to AA. For example, a small cross-sectional 
study in Israel found that serum vitamin D levels <30 ng/ml were significantly associated 
with AA (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 2.2-3.1).23 This finding has been replicated in other 
studies.24,25,26,27,28,29,30
In a 2017 review of the literature, serum vitamin D, zinc, and folate were found to be 
generally lower in patients with AA than in patients without AA.31 However, there were 
conflicting findings for iron, vitamin B12, copper, magnesium, and selenium.31
Lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, are associated with AA. Indeed, 
current smokers had a 1.86 to 2.25-fold increased risk of AA, depending on the smoking 
habits, in a recent (2020) study from Taiwan.32
AA incidence may also be associated with other environmental factors, such as social 
deprivation (IRR most vs least deprived quintile 1.47; 95% CI 1.37-1.59) and urban living 
(IRR 1.23; 95% CI 1.14-1.32).3 Further, a US study has suggested a possible seasonal 
pattern, with a greater frequency of flares in the winter.33
SI.3. Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity: 
The three main variants of AA are patchy AA (localised hairless areas), AT (entire scalp 
affected), and AU (affecting all body surface area).1 Other AA subtypes include ophiasis, 
Page 17
17
Ritlecitinib
Risk Management Plan
July 2023
sisaipho, alopecia incognita, and Marie Antoinette syndrome.1 AA severity can be divided 
into mild (≤3 patches), moderate (≥3 patches without AT or AU), severe (AT, AU), and 
ophiasis (Snake-shaped plaques extending to the scalp border or loss of hair in the shape of a 
wave at the circumference of the head).34,35 The SALT score is often used to report the 
overall percentage of the extent of hair loss on the scalp.36
Single centre studies have generally found that studied patients (including adults and 
paediatric patients) tend to most often have the patchy sub-type12,35,37,38 and be of mild-to 
moderate severity.35,38 A cross-sectional study of approximately 45,000 participants in the 
US aged 11 years and older reported the clinician-adjudicated point prevalence of “moderate 
to severe” (>50% SALT score) AA was 0.09% and the clinician-adjudicated point prevalence 
for the subset of AA with AT/AU was 0.04%.9 Generally, earlier disease onset is associated 
with a higher likelihood of severe alopecia.11,12,37 For example, one study reported full or 
significant re-growth of hair after the first episode in 74% of childhood-onset patients, as 
compared to 94% of adult-onset patients.38
Paediatric Onset
The severity of the first visit has been associated with more severe long-term prognosis,39,40
however this trend was not apparent in patients with childhood-onset disease in at least one 
study.39 Another study assessing the long-term course of AA across age groups, reported that
the proportion of patients with relapses after diagnosis was high overall (52%, 44% and 30% 
in childhood-onset, adult-onset and late-onset, respectively), however, relapses declined over 
time, with the majority (79%) occurring within the first 4 years after initial diagnosis.38 In 
that study, both the duration of first AA episode and the duration of the disease-free interval 
after the first episode tended to be shorter in younger patients.38
Mortality
A large population-based study in Korea did not find an association between AA and 
increased risk of all-cause mortality.41 However, an increased risk of mortality associated 
with intentional self-harm/psychiatric diseases was found in patients with AA compared to 
controls (HR 1.21; 95% CI 1.04-1.41), and this risk was even greater among adult patients 
aged 35 years or younger (HR 1.68; 95% CI 1.32-2.12) and patients with AT/AU (HR 1.85; 
95% CI 1.25-2.75).41 Mortality associated with lung cancer was greater in patients with 
AT/AU (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.41-3.33) and the risk of mortality associated with diabetes 
mellitus was significantly lower in AA patients (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.36-0.79).41
SI.4. The main existing treatment options:
At the time of the preparation of the original submission dossier, there were no approved 
treatments for AA by the EU or MHRA, although baricitinib (a JAK inhibitor with 
preferential selectivity towards JAK1/2) had received a positive CHMP opinion in May 2022 
for the treatment of severe AA. Since the original submission, baricitinib has received 
marketing authorization in the EU and UK for the treatment of adult patients with severe AA.  
Review of the expert recommendations including the AAD, BAD guidelines, Italian 
guidelines, ACE, and NICE Clinical Knowledge Summary indicate a number of off-label 
Page 18

Ritlecitinib
Risk Management Plan
July 2023
therapies, including injectables, topicals, and systemics, that are frequently used after 
assessing factors such as the age of the patient, disease extent and disease duration. 
There is no therapy which reliably produces long-term remissions of disease off drug nor is 
there a therapy convincingly demonstrated to have the efficacy and safety appropriate for 
long-term management required to maintain hair re-growth.42,43,44,45,46A large proportion of 
patients are dissatisfied with treatment options in AA. A survey conducted in 2016 in the US 
showed that 78.1% of AA patients were very or somewhat unsatisfied, compared to 7.7% 
who were very or somewhat satisfied with the current medical treatments for AA.47
Additionally, in the ACE, a panel of 50 hair experts achieved only 33% consensus for 
treatment specific questions and concluded that there is a need for robust research in AA 
therapeutics to support clinical decision making.48
While some treatment guidelines and consensus statements define AA involving ≥50% scalp 
hair loss as "extensive" or "severe" AA, there is no agreed upon definition of severity and no 
established standard of care for ≥50% scalp hair loss. Treatment recommendations vary 
between guidelines and expert consensus statements, but generally distinguish between 
“acute” or “active” vs “chronic” AA.42,48,49
The AAD, BAD, Italian guidelines, and international recommendations summarize evidence 
based on expert opinion (dermatologist experience), clinical study data and RWE,48,49,50,51,52
The evidence for efficacy of any of the off-label treatments reviewed is variable and limited, 
and a standard of care in AA has not been established.42,46,48
Corticosteroids 
ILCS are commonly used for limited AA 42,44,49 and can be used as adjunctive therapy to 
systemic treatment in those with extensive disease (SALT >50).53 Response defined as >50% 
improvement is poorer in extensive AA (25-50% after 6 months) in comparison to limited 
AA even with longer duration of therapy (82.1% after 12 weeks).53 Treatments require 
frequent office visits as they are repeated every 4 to 6 weeks. Adverse effects can include 
pain, atrophy of the skin and hair follicles, telangiectasia, and hypo/depigmentation.54 Skin 
atrophy and telangiectasia may inhibit hair regrowth; therefore, this risk should be minimised 
by use of smaller volumes and number of injections per site.52 Additionally, there can be a 
risk for cataract and raised intraocular pressure if ILCS are used close to the eye when 
treating eyebrows.42,54 Pain may limit the practicality of this treatment modality, especially 
for children and patients with extensive scalp involvement. 
TCS can be used in limited AA and children under 10 years of age may prefer this treatment 
due to intolerance of painful ILCS injections.53 However, monotherapy use may be 
ineffective.42,44,45,46,55 Data suggest limited benefit with topical compared to injectable 
corticosteroids.53 A small randomised controlled trial (n=54) showed ILCS to be significantly 
better than topical corticosteroids in achieving complete hair regrowth (P=0.03).56 Side 
effects associated with topical corticosteroids include folliculitis, itching and burning of the 
skin, acne, stretch marks, and skin atrophy. 53,57 It is recommended to wash the skin after 12 
hours of application to minimize the risk for folliculitis and limit use to 5 times a week to 
prevent the onset of skin atrophy.51

SC are recommended in patients 13 years of age and above with acute AA and SALT >30. 
Use is not recommended in adolescents with chronic AA with SALT >50 due to the potential 
toxicity associated with the likely requirement for prolonged treatment.48 Studies report 
response rates based on >75% scalp coverage or regrowth of affected area to range from 
28.6-63.3% and have shown that ophiasis and AT/AU are far less responsive than patchy or 
recent-onset AA.58,59 Long-term use is limited by side effects such as weight gain, 
osteoporosis, cataract formation, hypertension, peptic ulceration, metabolic abnormalities, 
gastrointestinal irritation, and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA 
axis) along with high relapse rates (22-100%).49,60,61
Contact Immunotherapy
In adults and children >10 years of age presenting with SALT ≥50, AAD recommends 
contact immunotherapy with DPCP or SADBE.44 The BAD and Japanese guidelines also 
recommend contact immunotherapy as first-line therapy.42,52 Reported response rates defined 
as >75% scalp hair coverage are 88.1% and 17.4% for patients with 50-74% and 100% scalp 
involvement at baseline, respectively, suggesting poorer response with more extensive 
disease.62 DPCP requires a sensitization process with the concentration of the sensitizing 
agent increased weekly until a low-grade erythema and mild pruritus is achieved on the 
treated area for 24 to 36 hours after application. The solution should be applied weekly and 
left on the scalp for 48 hours before being washed off. Exposure to the sun should be avoided 
during this time. This process may be time-consuming and burdensome to patients as well as 
to HCPs who have to apply it and avoid occupational sensitization. Side effects include 
severe eczema, vesicular or bullous reactions, facial and scalp edema, and occipital and/or 
cervical lymphadenopathy. Over the long-term, approximately one third of responders may 
eventually stop responding.63  
Immunomodulators/suppressors
The AAD and BAD guidelines mention that broad immunomodulators or 
immunosuppressants (including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, psoralen plus 
ultraviolet A, and calcineurin inhibitors) may be used in treatment refractory patients.42,53
These treatments can be included in dermatologist’s armamentarium based on experience in 
uncontrolled studies; however, limited evidence in AA patients is available.48,63 Due to weak 
evidence from case reports or small uncontrolled retrospective studies,50 demonstrating 
varying efficacy, high relapse rates, and systemic side effects (including but not limited to 
hypertension, malignancies, bone marrow suppression, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and 
pancytopenia) these treatments are not commonly recommended or appropriate for long-term 
treatment.42,44  
Minoxidil
Topical minoxidil is approved for treatment of androgenetic alopecia, but it is also used off-
label (topical and oral) for other hair loss conditions. Minoxidil’s mode of action for 
stimulation of hair regrowth is not fully understood (vasodilation and angiogenesis are 
among the mechanisms that have been postulated), but it does not have a direct 
immunomodulatory effect and thus is not expected to alter the course of AA or induce 
Page 20

remission. However, both oral and topical minoxidil are sometimes used (off-label) as 
adjunctive therapy to oral or topical steroids to stimulate hair growth in AA, although 
evidence is scarce and histologic studies on its effect on perifollicular lymphocytic 
infiltration in AA are inconsistent.53,59,64,65 Its use is less common in extensive disease due to 
limited efficacy and unsatisfactory results when used as monotherapy.57 Topical minoxidil is 
not expected to be effective in AT/AU.50 Side effects with oral minoxidil may include 
hypertrichosis and postural hypotension, while topical minoxidil may cause itching and 
dermatitis.59  
Treatment In Refractory Patients
It should be noted that extensive AA can become less responsive or refractory to treatment if 
it has been active for a substantial period of time before effective treatment commences. 
Studies with oral corticosteroids and topical immunotherapy have shown that early initiation 
of treatment within 3 months to 1 year of disease onset may be more effective and disease 
may be less likely to relapse in comparison to patients who start treatment later.66,67,68 It has 
also been suggested that patients with AA may be more refractory to the benefit of JAK 
inhibition when episodes of hair loss have lasted 10 years or longer.69 Thus, it is important to 
offer patients effective treatment early.53

Module SII. Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification
Ritlecitinib has undergone a comprehensive toxicological evaluation in dogs, rats, rabbits, 
and mice in studies up to 2 years in duration. Safety pharmacology studies were conducted in 
vitro and in vivo (rats and dogs) to assess potential effects on cardiovascular, pulmonary, or 
neurofunctional endpoints. In vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies were conducted to 
assess the genotoxic potential of ritlecitinib. Chronic toxicity assessment was conducted in 
rats and dogs. Fertility and pre- and postnatal development studies were conducted in rats, 
and embryo-foetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Carcinogenicity 
was assessed in a 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse study and a 2-year rat carcinogenicity 
study. The above comprehensive nonclinical data package supports using ritlecitinib in 
participants 12 years of age and above. The ages of rats (approximately 7 weeks at dose 
initiation) and dogs (approximately 9-12 months at dose initiation) used in the chronic 
toxicity studies are comparable to adolescent human age (≥12 years). 
Table 4 provides a summary of key safety findings from ritlecitinib nonclinical studies.
Table 4. Key Safety Findings and Relevance to Human Usage
Key Safety Findings from Non-clinical Studies
Relevance to Human Usage
Toxicity
Central and Peripheral Nervous System
Chronic administration of ritlecitinib to dogs led to the 
occurrence of axonal dystrophy (swelling) in the CNS 
or PNS at systemic exposures at least 7.4-times the 
expected exposure in patients treated with 50 mg per 
day (based on unbound AUC24). Axonal dystrophy is 
presumably related to binding to off-target neuronal 
proteins. The finding was not associated with 
microscopic evidence of a degenerative process or 
impact on myelination or synapses. It is not known if 
axonal dystrophy occurred in dogs at lower systemic 
exposures. At 33-times the expected exposure in 
patients treated with 50 mg per day (based on unbound 
AUC24), axonal dystrophy was associated with 
neurological hearing loss. Axonal dystrophy and 
hearing loss reversed after dosing cessation of 
ritlecitinib in dogs.
. 
Immune and haematolymphopoietic system
Effects on the immune and haematolymphopoietic
systems were consistent with the intended 
pharmacologic activity of ritlecitinib (inhibition of 
JAK3 and TEC kinases). Effects in animals were 
reversible and associated with over-immunosuppression 
leading to opportunistic infections at exposures 
≥14 times the unbound AUC24 at the 50 mg human 
dose.
The clinical relevance of ritlecitinib-related axonal 
dystrophy was evaluated in the ritlecitinib clinical 
program. Overall, events evaluated by 
independent external adjudication as potential 
neurological and/or audiological safety events of 
interest did not demonstrate evidence suggestive 
of neurotoxicity or ototoxicity with ritlecitinib 
treatment. Clinical safety study B7981037 
demonstrated no effect on axonal swelling in 
IENFs or IENF density and no notable mean 
changes from baseline in BAEP I-V interwave 
latency or Wave V amplitude at 80dB nHL 
following 9 months of administration of the 
proposed chronic therapeutic dose of ritlecitinib 
compared to placebo.  
Neurotoxicity is an important potential risk for 
ritlecitinib.
Ritlecitinib, due to pharmacologic inhibition of 
JAK3 and TEC kinases, may be associated with 
immunosuppression; opportunistic and/or serious 
infections should be considered an important 
potential risk to humans.

Lower circulating WBC, lymphocytes, monocytes, 
eosinophils, and/or basophils were observed in rats.
Similarly, lower circulating lymphocytes were noted in 
dogs. Decreases in circulating lymphocytes correlated 
with decreased cellularity of lymphoid tissues.
Immunophenotyping conducted in the 8-week and 
9-month studies in dogs showed decreases in total 
T cells, T helper cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells. 
Decreases in B cells were also observed at 
45 mg/kg/day in the 8-week study and at all doses in the 
first 9-month toxicity study only.
Dose-dependent and fully reversible decreases in RBC
parameters (haemoglobin, hematocrit, and
reticulocytes) and increases in platelets and fibrinogen 
were observed in rats or dogs without adverse 
macroscopic or microscopic findings indicative of 
hematologic dysfunction or systemic infection.
In placebo-controlled clinical trials, ritlecitinib 
treatment was associated with decreases in 
lymphocyte counts. The incidence of 
discontinuations from clinical studies due to 
decreased lymphocyte counts was low. There was 
no association between lower lymphocyte counts 
and the rate of serious infection or herpes zoster. 
Age appeared to be a risk factor for lower ALC in 
participants ≥65 years of age.
The clinical data are sufficient to conclude that 
Lymphocyte count decreased is an ADR.
In AA clinical trials, treatment with ritlecitinib 
was associated with dose-dependent early 
decreases in T-lymphocytes (CD3) and T 
lymphocyte subsets (CD4 and CD8). After the 
initial decrease, levels partially recovered and 
remained stable throughout the remainder of the 
clinical trial period. There was no change in B 
lymphocytes (CD19) in any treatment group. 
There was a dose-dependent early decreased in 
NK cells (CD16/56) which remained stable 
throughout the remainder of the clinical trial 
period. The clinical relevance of decreases in 
lymphocyte subsets (circulating T cell 
lymphocytes and NK cells) is defined under 
Lymphocyte count decreased.
Haemoglobin: In clinical trials there was a slight 
median decrease from baseline (BL) in 
haemoglobin (Hgb) up to 4 weeks after initiation 
of ritlecitinib; Hgb remained stable and near BL to 
Week 24 with a slight median decrease from BL 
observed at Week 48 in the All-Exposure Pool (50 
mg).  Less than 0.1% of patients met protocol-
specified discontinuation criteria for change in 
Hgb (< 0.9 g/dL) or a decrease of > 30% 
(confirmed with a retest) from BL. No participant 
had confirmed Hgb < 8g/dL. 
Platelets: In the placebo-controlled clinical trials 
for up to 24 weeks, treatment with ritlecitinib was 
associated with a decrease in platelet count. 
Maximum effect on platelets were observed 
within 4 weeks after which platelet counts 
remained stable at a lower level with continued 
therapy. Across all clinical trials with ritlecitinib, 
< 0.1% of patients treated with ritlecitinib 50 mg 
or higher had a confirmed platelet count < 100 
x103/mm3. No patient had a confirmed platelet 
count of < 75 x 103/mm3. There were no bleeding 
events associated with changes in platelets.

The clinical data are sufficient to conclude that 
Platelet count decreased is an ADR.
These findings are not relevant to human usage. 
Lipofuscin and alpha2µ globulin are findings 
noted in normal rats and have limited or no renal 
functional or clinical significance. 
There was no evidence of effects on the kidney in 
clinical trials with ritlecitinib; there were no 
clinically meaningful changes in serum creatinine 
over time in any ritlecitinib treatment group or 
placebo.
These findings are not relevant to human usage.
Multinucleated hepatocytes are considered an 
adaptive response and not an indication of 
potential carcinogenicity.
Multinucleated hepatocytes can occur 
spontaneously in aged rats; therefore, the 
increased prominence of these findings in rats was 
considered a ritlecitinib-related exacerbation of 
background findings in rats without relevance to 
humans.
Effects on the adrenal gland or adrenal gland 
function are not anticipated in humans based on 
known pharmacology of JAK or TEC inhibitors.
There was no evidence of effects on the adrenal 
gland in clinical trials with ritlecitinib.
Based upon the clinical trial data, diarrhea is an 
ADR for ritlecitinib.
Results from the rat fertility toxicity study are not 
relevant to human usage at clinically relevant 
exposures.
Kidney
Reversible hyaline droplet accumulation in proximal 
tubular epithelial cells (primarily lipofuscin in the 
medulla and alpha2μ-globulin in the cortex) was 
observed in the chronic rat toxicity study only and did 
not progress with longer dose administration, as 
demonstrated by data from the 2-year rat 
carcinogenicity study.
Liver
Hepatocyte vacuolation or centrilobular hypertrophy 
were observed only in shorter (≤8-week) rat toxicity 
studies. 
Non-neoplastic increases in multinucleated hepatocytes 
(relative to controls) were observed in female rats in the 
2-year carcinogenicity study. No microscopic evidence 
of hepatocyte degeneration, necrosis, or inflammation 
was noted.
Adrenal Gland
Transient, dose-related findings not associated with 
degenerative changes in the adrenal gland were noted in 
short-duration toxicity studies in rats and dogs. Lower 
adrenal weights (males) and increased adrenal cortical 
vacuolation were observed in rats and an increase in the 
incidence and/or severity of cortical cell vacuolation 
was observed in the zona glomerulosa in male dogs.
Abnormal feces
Abnormal feces (soft, watery, mucoid, red-tinged) were 
observed in dogs without macroscopic or microscopic 
findings in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Reproductive/developmental toxicity
Fertility
Ritlecitinib did not affect female rat fertility at 
exposures up to 55 times the unbound AUC24 at the 
50 mg human dose. Male rat fertility was affected at 
55 times the unbound AUC24 at the 50 mg human dose.
There was a higher number of preimplantation losses 
resulting in a lower number of implantation sites and 
corresponding lower litter size in naïve females mated 
with ritlecitinib dosed males.

Key Safety Findings from Non-clinical Studies
Relevance to Human Usage
Results from rat and rabbit EFD toxicity studies 
are potentially relevant to human usage.
The foetal skeletal findings in pregnant animals 
are not relevant to usage in adults and adolescents 
>12 years of age.
Pregnancy is contraindicated and Embryofoetal 
toxicity following exposure in utero is an 
important potential risk for ritlecitinib.
Reproductive/developmental
Developmental effects observed when pregnant rats and 
rabbits were administered ritlecitinib included skeletal 
malformations and variations and lower foetal body 
weights in both species, and higher incidences of 
visceral malformations (kidney malformation) and 
higher postimplantation loss in rabbits. The lowest 
NOAEL from the EFD studies was in rabbits with an 
exposure margin of 12 times the unbound AUC24 at the 
50 mg human dose. 
In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, 
adverse ritlecitinib-related effects were observed at the 
highest dose in the F1 male and female offspring, at 
41 times the unbound AUC24 at the 50 mg human dose. 
This dose included lower mean postnatal survival, lower 
body weights, and lower body weight gains during the 
preweaning and postweaning periods, effects on sexual 
maturation (considered secondary to the lower body 
weights), and effects on reproduction in F1 females 
(lower mean number of corpora lutea, implantation 
sites, and viable embryos). The exposure margins at the 
NOAEL of 75 mg/kg/day for developmental toxicity 
was 14 times the unbound AUC24 at the 50 mg human 
dose.
A juvenile toxicity study was conducted to determine 
the potential effects of oral administration of ritlecitinib 
on postnatal growth and development, including effects 
on the skeletal and nervous systems and neurobehavior, 
in juvenile male and female Wistar Han rats when 
administered by oral gavage from postnatal day (PND) 
10 through PND 60. These ages correspond to a human 
age range of approximately 3 months to adolescence.
There were no ritlecitinib-related effects on bone 
growth or the CNS/PNS, synaptogenesis, myelination,
or neurobehavioral endpoints at exposures up to 19
times the unbound AUC24 at the 50 mg human dose. 
Delayed attainment of balanopreputial separation and 
shorter femur length (relative to control) were observed 
secondary to the lower body weight and body weight 
gain in males at 100 mg/kg/day, findings which are 
observed secondary to lower body weights.
The NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/day for males based on the 
adverse effects on body weight/body weight gain at 
100 mg/kg/day, and as 100 mg/kg/day for females, 
based on the lack of adverse effects at any dose (7-and 
19 times, respectively, the unbound AUC24 at the 50 mg 
human dose).

Genotoxicity
Ritlecitinib was negative in the bacterial reverse
mutation assay. Ritlecitinib was not aneugenic or 
clastogenic at exposures equal to 130 times the 
unbound AUC24 at the 50 mg human dose based on the 
results of the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus 
assay.
Carcinogenicity
In a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study in Wistar Han rats, 
a higher incidence of benign thymomas in female rats 
and benign thyroid follicular cell adenomas in male rats 
were noted following ritlecitinib administration at 
exposures equal to 29 times the unbound AUC24 at the 
50 mg human dose. At this ritlecitinib exposure, a 
higher incidence of malignant thymomas in female rats 
cannot be excluded. No ritlecitinib-related thymomas or 
thyroid follicular adenomas were observed at exposures 
≤6.3 times the unbound AUC24 at the 50 mg human 
dose. No evidence of tumourigenicity was observed in 
the 6-month Tg.rasH2 mice administered ritlecitinib at 
exposures equal to 11 times the unbound AUC24 at the 
50 mg human dose. 
Safety Pharmacology
Cardiovascular system
There was no ritlecitinib-related QTc prolongation after 
administration of ritlecitinib in any safety 
pharmacology CV or effects on the CV system in the 
repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs. The IC50 value for 
the inhibitory effect of ritlecitinib on the hERG 
potassium current was >273 times the unbound Cmax at 
the 50 mg human dose.
Low magnitude and inconsistent changes in heart rate 
and blood pressure were observed in safety 
pharmacology and toxicity studies. There were no 
microscopic changes in the heart in any toxicity study 
and no evidence of ritlecitinib-related thrombi, emboli, 
or changes in coagulation parameters in rats or dogs in 
Page 27
Not relevant to human usage.  
Not relevant to human usage.
The mechanism by which ritlecitinib leads to 
increased thymoma and benign thyroid follicular 
adenoma incidence in rats is likely related to a 
non-genotoxic mechanism as ritlecitinib is not 
genotoxic.
Furthermore, there is evidence that thymoma and 
benign thyroid follicular adenomas are rat 
specific. Female Wistar rats exhibit strain-specific 
differences in thymus biology, and thymomas in 
these rats form spontaneously with age at a high 
incidence relative to other rat strains. This effect 
has been demonstrated to be exacerbated 
following administration of other 
immunosuppressive drugs. Male Wistar Han rats 
are particularly susceptible to spontaneous thyroid 
adenomas as they age, and published literature 
suggests there is limited translation of rodent 
thyroid tumours to humans.
No events of benign or malignant thymoma have 
been reported in ritlecitinib clinical studies. 
Malignancy is an important potential risk for 
ritlecitinib. 
Not relevant to human usage.
There were no clinically meaningful changes in 
ECG measurements in participants in ritlecitinib 
treatment or placebo in clinical trials. There were 
no clinically meaningful changes in baseline 
median QTcF interval over time across the 
treatment groups up to week 48. In a 
concentration/QTc analysis to characterize 
potential of ritlecitinib to prolong QTc interval, no 
evidence of any relevant QTc interval 
prolongation was observed.

repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 or 9 months in 
duration, respectively.
There were no clinically meaningful changes 
across ritlecitinib treatment groups in blood 
pressure and pulse rate in clinical trials.
Nervous system
There were no ritlecitinib-related effects on 
neurofunctional endpoints (body temperature, 
quantitative locomotor activity, or functional 
observation assessment) in rats.
Respiratory system
There were no ritlecitinib-related effects on respiratory 
endpoints (respiratory rate, tidal or minute volumes) in 
rats.
Drug interactions 
The metabolism of ritlecitinib is mediated by multiple 
isoforms of Glutathione S-transferase (GST) (cytosolic 
GST A1/3, M1/3/5, P1, S1, T2, Z1 and microsomal 
MAPEG1/2/3) and CYP enzymes (CYP3A, CYP2C8, 
CYP1A2, and CYP2C9), with no single clearance route 
contributing more than 25%. Hence, drugs inhibiting a 
selective metabolic pathway are unlikely to impact the 
systemic exposures of ritlecitinib. Specific inhibitors of 
transporters are unlikely to result in clinically relevant 
changes in the bioavailability of ritlecitinib.
Ritlecitinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A.
Ritlecitinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2.
Ritlecitinib and OCT1 substrates
Based on itraconazole and rifampin DDI studies, 
no clinically significant changes in AUCinf were 
observed. Dose adjustment is not required when 
ritlecitinib is administered with CYP3A inhibitors 
or CYP enzyme inducers.
Multiple doses of 200 mg once daily ritlecitinib 
increased the AUCinf and Cmax of midazolam a 
CYP3A4 substrate, by approximately 2.7 fold and 
1.8 fold, respectively. Ritlecitinib is a moderate 
inhibitor of CYP3A. Caution should be exercised 
with concomitant use of ritlecitinib with CYP3A 
substrates (e.g., quinidine, cyclosporine, 
dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, pimozide) where 
moderate concentration changes may lead to 
serious adverse reactions, and dose adjustment 
recommendations for the CYP3A substrate (e.g., 
colchicine, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus) 
should be considered.
Multiple doses of 200 mg once daily ritlecitinib 
increased the AUCinf and Cmax of caffeine, a 
CYP1A2 substrate, by approximately 2.7-fold and 
1.1- fold, respectively. Caution should be 
exercised with concomitant use of ritlecitinib with 
other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., tizanidine) where 
moderate concentration changes may lead to 
serious adverse reactions, and dose adjustment 
recommendations for the CYP1A2 substrate (e.g., 
theophylline, pirfenidone) should be considered. 
The coadministration of a single 400 mg dose of 
ritlecitinib increased the AUCinf of sumatriptan

(an OCT1 substrate) by approximately 1.3 to 1.5 
fold relative to sumatriptan dose given alone. The 
increase in sumatriptan exposure is not considered 
clinically relevant. Caution should be exercised 
with concomitant use of ritlecitinib with OCT1 
substrates where small concentration changes may 
lead to serious adverse reactions.
Ritlecitinib did not produce clinically significant 
changes in the exposures of oral contraceptives 
(e.g., ethinyl oestradiol or levonorgestrel), 
CYP2B6 substrates (e.g., efavirenz), CYP2C 
substrates (e.g., tolbutamide), or substrates of 
organic anion transporter (OAT)P1B1, breast 
cancer resistant protein (BCRP), and OAT3 (e.g., 
rosuvastatin). 
There are no data on the presence of ritlecitinib in
human milk, effects on the breast-fed infant, or 
effects on milk production.
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded and
ritlecitinib is contraindicated during breastfeeding.
Module SIII. Clinical Trial Exposure
The ritlecitinib clinical trial program includes 21 Phase 1 studies, 2 completed studies of 
participants with AA (1 Phase 2a study and 1 Phase 2b/3 study), 2 ongoing studies of 
participants with AA (1 Phase 2a study and 1 Phase 3 long-term study).
Additional safety data from 5 clinical studies in other indications is also included: vitiligo (1 
completed Phase 2b study), UC (1 completed Phase 2b study), Crohn’s disease (1 ongoing 
Phase 2a study), and RA (1 completed Phase 2a study and 1 ongoing Phase 2 study).  
The clinical trial exposure data is provided for 2 safety pools, the Placebo-Controlled AA 
Pool and the All-Exposure Pool (AA + Vitiligo). The Placebo-Controlled AA Pool (PCPAA) 
includes studies (B7931005, B7981015, B7981037) with a placebo comparator, of similar 
duration (24 weeks), similar doses of ritlecitinib, similar patient populations and comparable 
safety outcome assessments.  The treatment groups summarised in this pool are participants 
who received ritlecitinib 200/50 mg (200 mg for 4 weeks, followed by 50 mg); 50/50 mg, All 
50 mg (combined 200/50 mg and 50/50 mg), All 30 mg (combined 200/30 mg and 30/30 mg) 
and 10 mg, with placebo as a comparator.  The studies in this pool allow for comparison of 
adolescent and adult data as Study B7981015 includes both adolescents and adults and 
Studies B7931005 and B7981037 include adults. Cumulatively through 04 January 2022, 
there were 345 participants exposed to ritlecitinib All 50 mg in the PCPAA, totaling 154.4
patient-years of exposure to ritlecitinib 50 mg or higher (Table 5).

The All-Exposure Pool includes the same studies (B79831005, B7981015, B7981037) 
included in the placebo-controlled pool, the long-term, open-label study (B7981032), and a 
Phase 2b study in vitiligo (B7981019).  Study B7981019 in vitiligo is relevant for the 
evaluation of safety in AA due to similarities between AA and vitiligo populations (including 
disease pathophysiology, age distribution and comorbidities), similar dosing regimens to 
those in the AA studies, and similar safety monitoring. All participants who received 
ritlecitinib, from the start of their first dose of ritlecitinib in studies B7931005, B7981015, 
B7981019 and B7981037, as well as the long-term, open-label study B7981032 are included 
in this pool.  The treatment groups summarised in this pool are ritlecitinib All 50 mg (200/50 
mg, 100/50 mg, and 50/50 mg) and Any Ritlecitinib (participants who received any dose of 
ritlecitinib) from all studies.   Cumulatively through 30 May 2022, there were 1523 patients 
exposed to ritlecitinib All 50 mg in the All-Exposure Pool, totaling 1981 patient-years of 
exposure to ritlecitinib 50 mg or higher (Table 9).
Clinical Trial Exposure for ritlecitinib is provided in Table 5-Table 12.

Exclusion criteria 
with respect to 
psychiatric conditions
Any psychiatric condition including recent or active 
suicidal ideation or behavior that meets any of the 
following criteria: 


Suicidal ideation associated with actual intent and a 
method or plan in the past year: “Yes” answers on 
items 4 or 5 of the Columbia suicide severity rating 
scale (C-SSRS);
Previous history of suicidal behaviors in the past 5 
years: “Yes” answer (for events that occurred in the 
past 5 years) to any of the suicidal behavior items of 
the C-SSRS;
 Any lifetime history of serious or recurrent suicidal 


behavior;
Clinically significant depression: patient health 
questionnaire – 8 items (PHQ8) total score ≥15;
The presence of any current major psychiatric 
disorder that is not explicitly permitted in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Baseline values of
 Absolute neutrophil count of <1.2 x 109/L 
(<1200/mm3)
 Hemoglobin <11.0 g/dL or hematocrit <33%

 Absolute lymphocyte count of <0.80 x 109/L 
Platelet count of <150 x 109/L (<150,000/mm3)
(<800/mm3).
Exclusion criteria 
with respect to 
hematology 
parameters
Patients with AA have a 
higher incidence of SIB than 
the general population and, 
as such, to ensure patient 
safety, compliance with the 
protocol and interpretability 
of study results, it was 
important not to initiate 
patients with profound SIB 
in trials of an experimental 
drug. 
These criteria were included 
to mitigate the risk of the 
potential impact of JAK and 
TEC kinase inhibition on 
hematologic parameters. 
Although ritlecitinib 
selectivity for JAK3 and the 
TEC kinase family may 
spare adverse effects 
associated with other JAK 
signaling, such as 
neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia and 
anemia associated with 
JAK2 cytokine signaling, 
Is it considered to be included as 
missing information? Rationale
Not considered missing information.
Distribution of ritlecitinib to the brain is 
limited (brain:plasma AUC ratio <0.05). 
Analysis of participants with evidence of 
depression and anxietya at baseline (of 
Study B7981015) showed improvement 
in patients treated with ritlecitinib in the 
depression and anxiety subscales through 
week 48. 
Across all patients treated with ritlecitinib 
50 mg in the All Exposure Pool, there 
was 1 adolescent with a serious event of 
suicidal ideation, which was considered 
not related to study intervention by the 
investigator. 
Not considered missing information.
The clinical data are sufficient to 
determine that decreased lymphocyte 
count and decreased platelet counts (but 
not anemia or neutropenia), are ADRs. 
The SmPC states in Section 4.2 posology 
and method of administration that 
Treatment with ritlecitinib should not be 
initiated in patients with an absolute 
lymphocyte count (ALC) 
< 0.5 × 103/mm3 or a platelet count 
< 100 × 103/mm3.

Table 13. Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies within the Development Programme
Exclusion criteria
Reason for exclusion
Is it considered to be included as 
missing information? Rationale
this had not been tested in 
large populations. 
Exclusion criteria 
with respect to 
vaccinations
Vaccinated or exposed to a live or attenuated vaccine 
within the 6 weeks prior to the first dose of 
investigational product or is expected to be vaccinated or 
to have household exposure to these vaccines during 
treatment or during the 6 weeks following 
discontinuation of investigational product.
Adolescent participants 12 to <18 years old without 
documented evidence of having received varicella 
vaccination (2 doses) or those who do not have evidence 
of prior exposure to varicella zoster virus (VZV) based 
on serological testing (i.e., varicella zoster virus 
immunoglobulin G antibody [VZV IgG Ab]) at 
screening.
Use of live/attenuated vaccines is not 
considered missing information.
The SmPC states in Section 4.4 Special 
warnings and precautions for use that use 
of live attenuated vaccines should be 
avoided during or immediately prior to 
ritlecitinib treatment. In addition, the
SmPC states that prior to initiating 
ritlecitinib, it is recommended that 
patients be brought up to date with all 
immunisations, including prophylactic 
herpes zoster vaccinations, in agreement 
with current immunisation guidelines.
This exclusion criterion was 
included due to the risk of 
infection associated with the 
use of live vaccines in 
participants receiving drugs 
with immunosuppressive 
activity.
Immunosuppressive effects 
of ritlecitinib based on 
mechanism of action may
affect lymphocyte function 
and viral reactivation, 
therefore vaccination criteria
were included to minimize 
the participant's risk of 
infection.
Exclusion criteria 
with respect to 
infection history
 Have a history of systemic infection requiring 
hospitalization, parenteral antimicrobial therapy, 
or as otherwise judged clinically significant by 
the investigator within 6 months prior to day 1
.
 Have active chronic or acute infection requiring 
treatment with oral antibiotics, antivirals, 
It may be complicated to 
interpret safety data from 
studies which enrolled 
participants with a history of 
active or recurrent infection.
. In addition, participants 
with active TB, serious 
Not considered missing information.
Serious and opportunistic infections is an 
important potential risk.

antiparasitics, antiprotozoals, or antifungals 
within 4 weeks prior to Baseline, or superficial 
skin infections within 1 week prior to day 1.
 A subject known to be infected with HIV, 
Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.
 Have a history (single episode) of disseminated 
herpes zoster or disseminated herpes simplex, or 
a recurrent (more than one episode of) localised, 
dermatomal herpes zoster.
 Have evidence of untreated or inadequately 
treated active or latent Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (TB) infection.
infections such as sepsis, or 
opportunistic infections 
(OIs) may be at risk for 
prolonged or more 
complicated illness. 
Participants with recurrent 
or complicated HZ, active 
Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C 
may be at increased risk for 
reactivation.
Is it considered to be included as 
missing information? Rationale
treatment with ritlecitinib should be 
avoided in patients with an active, serious 
infection.
In addition, the SmPC recommends that 
patients be screened for TB before 
starting therapy with ritlecitinib.
Ritlecitinib should not be given to 
patients with active TB. Anti-TB therapy 
should be started prior to initiating 
therapy with ritlecitinib in patients with a 
new diagnosis of latent TB or previously 
untreated latent TB. Screening for viral 
hepatitis should be performed in 
accordance with local guidelines before 
starting therapy with ritlecitinib.
The SmPC also states that the risks and 
benefits of treatment with ritlecitinib 
should be carefully considered for 
patients:
 with chronic or recurrent 
infection
 who have been exposed to TB
 with a history of a serious or an 
opportunistic infection
 who have resided or travelled in 
areas of endemic TB or endemic 
mycoses; or
 with underlying conditions that 
may predispose them to 
infection

disease
Current or recent history of clinically significant severe, 
progressive, or uncontrolled renal disease (including but 
not limited to active renal disease or recent kidney 
stones)"
protect participant safety 
while the effects of 
ritlecitinib on renal 
parameters were further 
explored and understood.
Exclusion criteria 
with respect to 
hepatic impairment 
and transaminase 
increase
Current or recent history of clinically significant, severe, 
progressive or uncontrolled disease hepatic disease. 
 AST or ALT values >2 times the ULN;

Total bilirubin ≥1.5 times the ULN; participants 
with a history of Gilbert’s syndrome would be 
eligible provided the direct bilirubin is ≤ ULN.
These exclusion criteria 
were applied to clinical 
studies to protect participant 
safety while the effects of 
ritlecitinib on hepatic 
parameters were further 
explored and understood.
Is it considered to be included as 
missing information? Rationale
A study to evaluate PK in subjects with 
severe renal impairment provides dosing 
recommendations such that no clinically 
significant difference in safety profile is 
anticipated in patients with mild, 
moderate or severe renal impairment.
Use in patients with mild, moderate and 
severe hepatic impairment or with 
transaminase increase is not considered 
missing information. 
Based on studies to evaluate PK in 
subjects with mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment, no dosing adjustment is 
required in patients with mild and 
moderate hepatic impairment. As such, no 
difference in safety profile is anticipated 
for patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment.
Ritlecitinib is contraindicated in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment (Child 
Pugh C).

Exclusion criteria
Reason for exclusion
Concurrent use of these 
drugs may have 
compromised interpretation 
of efficacy endpoints and 
safety data as well as patient 
safety.
Is it considered to be included as 
missing information? Rationale
Not considered missing information.
Serious and opportunistic infections are 
considered an important potential risk for 
ritlecitinib. 
Exclusion with 
respect to other 
immunosuppressive 
agents
Have received any of the following treatment regimens 
specified in the timeframes prior to the first dose of study 
intervention as outlined below:
 Any prior treatment with non-B cell selective
lymphocyte depleting agents.

B-cell-depleting agents within 6 months or 5 
half-lives (if known), or until lymphocyte count 
returns to normal, whichever is longer.
 Other immunomodulatory biologic agents 
within 12 weeks or 5 half-lives (if known), 
whichever is longer.
 Use of systemic immunosuppressants within 8 
weeks or 5 half-lives (if known), whichever is 
longer.

Prior treatment with any JAK inhibitors 
(Permitted in Study B7981032).
Have a history of any lymphoproliferative disorder such 
as Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) related lymphoproliferative 
disorder, history of lymphoma, history of leukemia, or 
signs and symptoms suggestive of current lymphatic or 
lymphoid disease.
Have any present malignancies or have a history of 
malignancies with the exception of adequately treated or 
excised non-metastatic basal cell or squamous cell cancer 
of the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ.
Exclusion criteria 
with respect to 
history of malignancy 
and 
lymphoproliferative 
disorders
Drugs with 
immunosuppressive activity 
may have the potential to 
affect host defense against 
malignancies. Thus, 
exclusion of participants 
with known previous 
malignancy was prudent 
while data were generated 
on the incidence and type of 
malignancies observed in 
patients treated with 
ritlecitinib.
Not considered missing information.
The SmPC states in Section 4.4 Special 
warnings and precautions for use that the 
risks and benefits of ritlecitinib treatment 
should be considered prior to initiating or 
continuing therapy in patients with a 
known malignancy other than a 
successfully treated NMSC or cervical
cancer.
Malignancy is an important potential risk.

Table 13. Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies within the Development Programme
Exclusion criteria
Reason for exclusion
Exclusion due to 
know 
immunodeficiency 
disorder or with 
respect to family 
history of hereditary 
immunodeficiency
Exclusion criteria 
with respect to 
hearing loss
Have a known immunodeficiency disorder or a first-
degree relative with a hereditary immunodeficiency.
Have hearing loss with progression over the previous 5 
years, or sudden hearing loss, or middle or inner ear 
disease such as otitis media, cholesteatoma, Meniere's 
disease, labyrinthitis, or other auditory condition that is 
considered acute, fluctuating or progressive.
Patients with an 
immunodeficiency disorder 
could affect patient safety 
and would confound 
interpretation of safety data.
Patients with certain hearing 
conditions would confound 
interpretation of safety data. 
Is it considered to be included as 
missing information? Rationale
Not considered missing information. 
This exclusion criteria addresses a rare 
condition. Prescribers will be able to 
assess risk without specific risk 
minimization measures.
Not considered missing information.
Evaluation of the potential for hearing 
loss in the clinical program did not 
demonstrate evidence suggestive of
ototoxicity.  
a. HADS anxiety subscale score of > 7 for adults and >8 for adolescents is indicative of anxiety; a HADS depression subscale score of >7 for adults and >6 
for adolescents is indicative of depression. "
SIV.2. Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development Programmes
The clinical development programme, given its sample size and duration of follow-up at the time of submission, is unlikely to detect 
certain types of adverse reactions such as rare adverse reactions or adverse reactions with a long latency (eg, malignancies and 
cardiovascular events). The long-term safety data will continuously be collected via routine and additional pharmacovigilance 
activities.
SIV.3. Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-Represented in Clinical Trial Development Programmes
There has been limited exposure to ritlecitinib in special populations and no epidemiologic studies have been conducted in 
pregnant/lactating women.

ULN
Total bilirubin >1.5 times the ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert’s 
syndrome would be eligible provided the direct bilirubin was ≤ULN.
Current or recent history of clinically significant severe, progressive, or 
uncontrolled hepatic disease.
Study B7981016 evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of ritlecitinib 
in participants with hepatic impairment and in healthy participants with normal hepatic 
function. 10 participants with moderate hepatic impairment and 8 participants with 
normal hepatic function were enrolled. No dose adjustment is required in patients with 
mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment. Ritlecitinib is 
not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C).
Participants were excluded with:


Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 based on the age-
appropriate calculation.
Current or recent history of clinically significant severe, progressive, or 
uncontrolled renal disease (including but not limited to active renal disease or 
recent kidney stones).
Study B7981020 evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of ritlecitinib 
in participants with renal impairment and in healthy participants with normal renal 
function. Eight participants with severe renal impairment were enrolled. 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal 
impairment. Ritlecitinib was not studied in patients with end stage renal disease

(SmPC) and package leaflet (PL) require no further characterisation and are followed via 
routine pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting. 
The risk minimisation messages in the product information are to be adhered to by 
prescribers (e.g. actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member state 
where the product is authorised).
SVII.1.2. Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP
The important potential risks are those events for which the level and/or totality of the 
evidence, after thorough evaluation of the data, as described above, was not judged sufficient 
to classify the risk as “identified” but are still considered important and for which additional 
characterization is planned.

Potential Mechanisms
Ritlecitinib’s pharmacology of inhibition of JAK3 and TEC family of kinases may result in 
modulation of multiple aspects of the immune response.92, 93 Viral reactivation, including 
herpes zoster infections, have been associated with the use of immunomodulators.  
Evidence Source and Strength of Evidence
Clinical study data with ritlecitinib and understanding of relevant mechanisms based on data 
from the JAK and TEC class of therapies.
Characterisation of the Risk
Frequency of Herpes zoster
The frequencies for herpes zoster and adjudicated opportunistic herpes zoster are provided in 
Table 17. Adjudicated opportunistic herpes zoster events are a subset of all herpes zoster.
There were 2 events confirmed as opportunistic infections; both were multi-dermatomal 
herpes zoster and neither was disseminated.  In the placebo-controlled AA pool, there was 1 
adjudicated event of multi-dermatomal herpes zoster (PT of Varicella zoster virus infection) 
in the ritlecitinib 200/50 mg group. In the All Exposure Pool, there was 1 additional event of 
multi-dermatomal herpes zoster (PT of Herpes zoster) in the all 50 mg group.

SVII.3.1.1.1. Risk Factors and Risk Groups
For all herpes zoster events (regardless of adjudication as opportunistic), age (≥65 years) was 
identified as a statistically significant covariate on the baseline incidence of herpes zoster 
infections.  In addition, while not identified in the covariate analysis, the IR for herpes zoster 
was higher in women than men.    
SVII.3.1.1.2. Preventability
Herpes zoster can have significant impact on individual patients.  Therefore, routine and 
additional RMMs have been proposed to mitigate the risk.  
Routine risk minimisation measures in the SmPC include a contraindication for patients with
active serious infections. Special warnings and precautions for use include consideration of
the risk and benefits of treatment in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Finally, the
SmPC recommends that immunization be up to date prior to initiating. Health care provider
and patient educational materials will include the risk for infections, including herpes zoster 
(see Section VI).
SVII.3.1.1.3. Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product
Herpes zoster infections may be mild, moderate, or severe and sometimes life-threatening.
SVII.3.1.1.4. Public Health Impact
Severe types of herpes zoster infection (e.g., disseminated herpes zoster), can lead to 
morbidity and mortality. The impact of these infections on public health is significant both in 
terms of lost time at work and increased burden on medical care.
SVII.3.1.2. Important Potential Risks:
SVII.3.1.2.1. Important Potential Risk: Serious and Opportunistic Infections 
Potential Mechanisms
Serious and opportunistic infections have been associated with the use of immunomodulators
including JAK inhibitors and TEC kinase family inhibitors.

Ritlecitinib’s mechanism of action includes effects on the immune system, therefore, serious 
infections and adjudicated opportunistic infections were assessed in the ritlecitinib 
development program.    
Characterisation of the Risk
Frequency of Serious Infections
The data from the ritlecitinib studies do not suggest a meaningful increase in the incidence of 
serious infections overall compared to placebo nor exhibit a dose response.

Ritlecitinib
Risk Management Plan
Risk Factors and Risk Groups
July 2023
Risk factors for serious infections include elderly age, certain medical conditions such as 
diabetes, patients that use drugs along with ritlecitinib that suppress the immune system 
(including corticosteroids), patients with low absolute lymphocyte counts and people with 
weakened immune systems.
Preventability
Serious infections and opportunistic infections (including herpes zoster) can have significant 
impact on individual patients. Therefore, routine and additional RMMs have been proposed 
to mitigate the risk. 
Routine risk minimisation measures in the special warnings and precautions for use section 
of the product label include the benefits and risks of treatment in patients with chronic or 
recurrent infection, patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis (TB) or who have a 
history of serious infection or opportunistic infection. Patients should be screened for TB 
before starting therapy; screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with 
clinical guidelines prior to starting therapy with ritlecitinib. 
Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection 
during and after treatment with ritlecitinib. Treatment should be interrupted if a patient 
develops a serious or opportunistic infection. A patient who develops a new infection during 
treatment with ritlecitinib should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate 
for an immunocompromised patient, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, 
and the patient should be closely monitored. 
Health care provider and patient educational materials (non-routine risk minimisation 
measures) will include the risk for serious and opportunistic infections.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product
Infections may be mild and self-limited or more severe and sometimes fatal. While routine 
risk minimisation measures summarised below will mitigate much of the risk, some subjects 
may still have serious infections. Herpes zoster infections may be mild, moderate, or severe 
and sometimes life-threatening. Therefore, routine and non-routine risk minimisation 
measures are proposed (see Section III.1 and Section III.2). 
Routine risk minimisation measures in prescribing information include instruction that 
patients should be monitored for infection, promptly evaluated and treated for infection and 
that therapy should be interrupted if the patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection. 
Health care provider and patient educational materials will include the risk for serious and 
opportunistic infections. Further, prescribing information includes specific cautionary 
language with respect to elderly and use in the diabetic population in general, as there is a 
higher incidence of infections in these populations.

Public Health Impact
July 2023
Serious infection is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. The impact of these 
infections on public health is significant both in terms of lost time at work and increased 
burden on medical care.  Reports of an association between AA and infections, including 
Helicobacter pylori infection,29,94 cytomegalovirus,95 Epstein-Barr virus,96 human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV),97,98 coronavirus disease,99,100 and others,101,102,103 have been 
reported in some small studies and case reports. However, not all studies have found this 
association.104,105,106 Studies reporting the overall risk of infections in AA patients have not 
been found.
In the general population, the incidence rate of serious infections ranged between 78.5 

and 107 per 10,000 population.107,108 ,109
In the general population, the rate of opportunistic infections including herpes zoster, 

opportunistic infections excluding herpes zoster, and herpes zoster was 1.2,108 2.1,107 and 
54.4107 per 10,000 person-years, respectively.
SVII.3.2. Important Potential Risk: Malignancy
Potential Mechanisms
Malignancy events are of special interest for agents such as ritlecitinib that have an 
immunomodulatory mechanism of action due to potential decreased immune surveillance. 
The immune system is thought to function as a tumour suppressor through the effect of 
cytokines or cell types (e.g., NK cells) that may be affected by a JAK3 and TEC family 
kinase inhibitor and other immunomodulators.110 When cancers developing in subjects with 
extreme immunosuppression (HIV infection or renal transplantation) are analysed, cancers 
related to infections with viruses and bacteria are overrepresented whereas the incidence of 
epithelial cancers (for example ovary and prostate) are not increased relative to age-matched 
controls.111
Evidence Source and Strength of Evidence
Clinical study data and understanding of immunomodulatory effects based on the data from 
the JAK class. Adjudicated malignancy events were assessed in the ritlecitinib development 
program.

Risk Management Plan
Risk Factors and Risk Groups
July 2023
Malignancies were observed in clinical studies of ritlecitinib. However, there were an 
insufficient number of events for risk factor or subgroup analysis. The risks and benefits of 
ritlecitinib treatment should be considered prior to initiating or continuing therapy in patients 
with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer 
(NMSC) or cervical cancer).
Preventability
Health care provider educational materials will include the risk of malignancy. In addition, 
periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin 
cancer.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product
Malignancy can severely impact a patient’s quality of life. While specific potential effects on 
an individual patient depend upon a variety of factors including site of malignancy, 
tolerability of therapy, and degree of social and emotional support, malignancy can cause 
psychological distress due to the gravity of the diagnosis and fear about its effects and 
possible recurrence. In addition, it can directly impact a patient’s physical functioning and 
lifespan. Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in fair-skinned individuals around 
the world. Although NMSC is rarely fatal, it can cause significant morbidity. As such, both 
routine and non-routine risk minimisation measures are proposed.
Public Health Impact
Malignancy is a major public health problem. It is among the leading causes of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide.112 There is conflicting evidence regarding the cancer risk associated 
with AA. For example, one large population-based study in Taiwan reported a significantly 
reduced risk of malignancy in male patients with AA as compared to the general population 
(standardised incidence ratio [SIR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.85-0.93), and no increased risk in females 
(SIR 1.02, 95% CI 0.97-1.06).113 However, another large population-based study reported a 
slightly higher overall cancer risk in AA patients as compared to age- and sex-matched 
comparators (HR 1.043; 95% CI 1.022-1.065).114 Risk of malignancy may vary by cancer 
subtype. Indeed, studies have generally reported decreased risks for 
gastric,29,81,114colorectal,29,81,114 and uterine113,114 cancers in AA patients, and a decreased or 
no increased risk of nonmelanoma skin,113 lung,29,81,113,114 and liver81,113,114 cancer. Patients 
with AA may be at an increased risk for thyroid cancer,29,81,114 prostate cancer,114
lymphoma,113 and kidney and urinary bladder cancer 113,114 however findings are not 
consistent across studies.29,113,114 The incidence rate of overall cancer in patients with AA 
was reported as 37.3 per 10,000 person-years.114
The incidence rate of a selection of cancer subtypes in patients with AA is reported below:114

Risk Management Plan
Risk Factors and Risk Groups
July 2023
There was an insufficient number of cases to analyze risk factors from the ritlecitinib clinical 
trial data. Risk factors for thromboembolic events in the general population also apply to 
patients with AA including older age, obesity, a medical history of thromboembolism, 
prothrombotic disorder, use of combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement 
therapy, patients undergoing major surgery, or prolonged immobilization.
Preventability
Ritlecitinib should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for thromboembolic 
events. Patients with signs and symptoms of a thromboembolic event should be urgently 
evaluated. Healthcare provider and patient educational materials will include information on 
the risk of a thromboembolic event.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product
Thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and arterial 
thrombosis can have an impact on individual patients and may lead to significant morbidity
or mortality.  
Public Health Impact
Venous Thromboembolic Events
Venous thromboembolic events, comprised of DVT and PE, represents a global health 
concern. A large commercial claims database study in the US reported that the incidence rate 
of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with AA was 9.4 per 10,000 person-years and 
was not significantly increased compared to propensity-score matched patients without 
chronic inflammatory skin diseases (HR: 0.97 [95% CI 0.65-1.46]).115
In the general population, the incidence rate of VTE ranges from 10 to 20 per 10,000 

person-years.116,117
In the general population, the incidence rate of pulmonary embolism (PE; with or 

without deep vein thrombosis) ranges from 2.9 to 7.8 per 10,000 person-years.117
In the general population, the incidence rate of deep vein thrombosis alone (without 

PE) ranges from 4.5 to 1.17 per 10,000 person-years.117
Arterial Thromboembolic Events
Ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic stroke are the most common forms of arterial 
thromboembolism.118 A study based in Taiwan reported an incidence rate of ischaemic stroke 
in patients with AA of 28.9 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI: 18.9-42.3).76 In that study, rate 
of ischemia stroke was significantly greater in patients with AA than comparator patients, 
even after adjusting for monthly income, geographic region, hyperlipidemia, and coronary 
heart disease (adjusted HR: 1.58 [95% CI: 1.00-2.45]).76 In contrast, a study in the US 
Page 84

Ritlecitinib
Risk Management Plan
July 2023
reported a significantly decreased risk of ischaemic stroke (OR: 0.39 [95% CI: 0.18-0.87]) 
and no increased risk of myocardial infarction (OR: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.59-1.39]) in AA patients 
as compared to propensity matched controls.75 Differences in racial distribution of study 
populations, validation of AA diagnosis, and accounting for the key confounder of smoking 
in the latter study have been proposed as potential explanations for the difference in 
ischaemic stroke rates.75
In the general population, the Global Burden of Disease project estimated an age-

standardised incidence rate of ischaemic heart disease of 151.9 per 10,000 person-years.119
In the general population, the Global Burden of Disease project estimated an age-

standardised incidence rate of ischaemic stroke of 11.4 per 10,000 person-years.119 However, 
a wide range of incidence rates has been reported in the literature depending on region of 
study and patient risk factors (0.07 to 54.5 per 10,000 person-years).118
SVII.3.4. Important Potential Risk: Embryofoetal toxicity following exposure in utero
Potential Mechanisms
The potential mechanism is unknown.
Evidence Source and Strength of Evidence
There are limited data from the use of ritlecitinib in human pregnancy. Studies in animals 
have shown developmental toxicity with no effects at clinically relevant exposures. In an 
embryofoetal development study in pregnant rats, oral administration of ritlecitinib from 
gestation days 6 to 17 resulted in foetal skeletal malformations and variations and lower 
foetal body weights at exposures greater than or equal to 49 times the unbound AUC at the 
MRHD. There were no effects on embryo-foetal development at exposures equal to 16 times 
the unbound AUC at the MRHD.
In an embryo-foetal development study in pregnant rabbits, oral administration of ritlecitinib 
from gestation days 7 to 19 resulted in lower mean foetal body weights and higher incidences 
of visceral malformations, skeletal malformations, and skeletal variations at exposures equal 
to 55 times the unbound AUC at the MRHD. There were no effects on embryo-foetal 
development at exposures equal to 12 times the unbound AUC at the MRHD.
In a rat pre- and postnatal development study, oral administration of ritlecitinib from 
gestation day 6 through lactation day 20 resulted in developmental toxicity that included 
lower postnatal survival, lower offspring body weights, and secondary developmental delays 
at exposure equal to 41 times the unbound AUC at the MRHD. Bred females in the F1 
generation exhibited lower mean numbers of corpora lutea at exposures equal to 41 times the 
unbound AUC at the MRHD. There were no effects on pre and postnatal development at 
exposures equal to 14 times the unbound AUC at the MRHD.

Maximum Severity
Not applicable.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups
Risk of foetal malformation pertains only to women of childbearing potential who become 
pregnant while receiving ritlecitinib.
Preventability
The use of ritlecitinib is contraindicated in pregnancy. Women of reproductive potential 
should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 month following 
treatment with ritlecitinib.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product
Embryofoetal toxicity effects could range from minor (minimal clinical implications) or 
major (having medical or social implications).
Public Health Impact
While pregnancy is contraindicated, this risk is included because the AA population includes 
a significant number of women of childbearing potential.
SVII.3.5. MACE
Potential Mechanisms
The potential mechanism is unknown.
Evidence Source and Strength of Evidence
It is not known whether selective JAK3 inhibition may be associated with adverse reactions 
of JAK inhibition predominantly involving JAK1 and JAK2. In a large randomised active-
controlled study of tofacitinib (another JAK inhibitor) in RA patients 50 years and older with 
at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of MACE, defined as 
cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke, and a dose 
dependent higher rate of venous thromboembolism including DVT and PE were observed

Ritlecitinib
Risk Management Plan
July 2023
Risk Factors and Risk Groups
There was an insufficient number of events in the ritlecitinib development program for 
formal risk factor or subgroup analysis and there are limited data in patients ≥ 65 years of 
age. Age ≥65 years, current or past smoking history, a history of atherosclerotic disease and
other cardiovascular risk factors are all considered risk factors for MACE in patients treated 
with JAK class inhibitors.
Preventability
Risks and benefits of ritlecitinib treatment should be considered prior to initiating therapy in 
patients with known risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product
Cardiovascular disease can have a significant impact on individual patients and may lead to 
significant morbidity and mortality.
Public health impact
Cardiovascular disease is associated with significant morbidity and is currently the top cause 
of death worldwide120. While some autoimmune diseases are associated with a higher risk of 
cardiovascular disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis121 and systemic lupus erythematous122, 
no differences in cardiovascular risk have been identified in patients with AA compared to 
the general population123.
SVII.3.6. Neurotoxicity
Potential Mechanisms
The potential mechanism is unknown.
Evidence Source and Strength of Evidence
Chronic nonclinical toxicity study in Beagle dogs showed the presence of axonal dystrophy 
in the CNS and PNS which was associated with a functional effect of BAEP waveform 
change at 33-times the human dose of 50 mg. Clinical data does not indicate an effect on 
neurological or audiological outcomes.

Risk Management Plan
Risk Factors and Risk Groups
July 2023
Risk factors in the general population include extremes in age, prior neurological disease, 
chronic illness and renal impairment.
Preventability
Treatment with ritlecitinib should be discontinued in case unexplained neurological 
symptoms occur.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product
Neurotoxicity can have an impact on individual patients and may lead to significant 
morbidity or mortality.     
Public health impact
Neurotoxicity potentially includes a broad group of nervous system diseases such as 
peripheral neuropathy, neurological hearing loss, and seizures, some more common than 
others and each with varying levels of severity. No differences in neurological risk have been 
identified in patients with AA compared to the general population124.

Active Safety Surveillance Study in Secondary Databases Summary
Study short name and title:
An Active Surveillance Study to Monitor the Real-World Safety of Ritlecitinib Among 
Patients with Alopecia Areata in Europe (See RMP Part VII Annex 3 for protocol synopsis).
Rationale and study objectives:
The study will be an active safety surveillance study to assess safety endpoints of interest 
associated with ritlecitinib in the post-approval setting.
The primary objective is to estimate the incidence rates (IRs) of safety events of interest 
among patients with AA receiving ritlecitinib and patients with AA receiving other approved 
systemic treatments for AA in a real-world setting. The following are the primary safety 
events of interest: 
 Thromboembolic events (including deep vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary 
embolism [PE], and arterial thrombosis);  
 Herpes zoster;
Page 113

 Serious infections;
 Opportunistic infections;
 Malignancy; 
July 2023
o Malignancy excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC); and
o NMSC.
 Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); 
 Neurological outcomes of interest; 
 Bone fractures; and 
 Growth metrics in adolescents (e.g., height and weight; Denmark only).
Other safety events may be added as understanding of the safety profile of ritlecitinib evolves 
and feasibility of their assessment permits.  
Study design:
This will be a cohort study using routinely collected electronic healthcare data. 
Study population:
The study population will include patients with AA who receive ritlecitinib and patients who 
receive approved comparator systemic treatments for AA (e.g., baricitinib) as recorded in 
routinely collected electronic healthcare data in Denmark, France, and Sweden.
Safety Assessments 
This study will assess the following safety outcomes in existing electronic healthcare data: 
thromboembolic events, herpes zoster, serious infections, malignancy, MACE, neurological 
outcomes of interest, bone fractures, and growth metrics in adolescents. The data include 
diagnosis and procedure codes, dispensed prescription medications, and administered 
medications.

Drug Utilization Study Summary
Study short name and title:
A Drug Utilization Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Risk Minimization Measures for 
Ritlecitinib in Europe Using Electronic Healthcare Data (See RMP Part VII Annex 3 for 
protocol synopsis)
Rationale and study objectives:
To mitigate the risks associated with the use of ritlecitinib, required routine risk minimization 
measures (RMMs), including the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and package 
leaflet, are being employed. In addition to the routine RMMs, the Applicant proposes to 
implement additional risk minimization measures (aRMMs) following ritlecitinib approval in 
EU. The aRMMs will include an educational program intended to enhance the 
communication of the risks and risk minimization practices to healthcare professionals 
(HCPs) via an “HCP Guide” and to patients via a “Patient Card”. 
A systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of RMMs helps to understand whether the 
program objectives have been met and may eventually provide evidence that further 
amendments to the program may be needed. Therefore, the Applicant will systematically 
evaluate the effectiveness of the RMMs being implemented for ritlecitinib.
Page 115

Ritlecitinib
Risk Management Plan
July 2023
The research question is: Do HCPs in the EU adhere to the recommendations for the use of 
ritlecitinib described in the SmPC, HCP guide, and Patient card?
The primary objectives are to: 
1. Evaluate, to the extent measurable in the available routinely collected data, indicators of 
HCPs adherence to the RMMs in accordance with the ritlecitinib SmPC and HCP guide, 
specifically: 






Indicators of adherence to performing laboratory tests of lymphocyte count, platelet 
count, hepatitis B/C, and tuberculosis (TB) screening prior to initiation of ritlecitinib 
treatment;
Indicators of adherence to performing laboratory tests of lymphocyte count and 
platelet count at week 4 (± 2 weeks) from initiation of ritlecitinib treatment;  
Indicators of adherence to avoid live attenuated vaccines shortly prior to and during 
treatment with ritlecitinib; 
Indicators of adherence to no use during pregnancy; 
Indicators of adherence to no use in patients aged < 12 years; and
Indicators of adherence to no use during serious infections.
2. Describe the characteristics of patients prior to initiation of ritlecitinib treatment, in terms 
of:
 Risk factors for thromboembolic events (including DVT, PE, and arterial 
thrombosis); 
 Risk factors for malignancy; and
 Risk factors for CV disease.
Study design:
This will be a cohort study of secondary data from healthcare databases in Denmark, France, 
and Sweden. 
Study population:
The study population will comprise of patients who are treated with ritlecitinib within 5 years 
from the time of product launch in the respective countries.

Active Safety Surveillance Study in Adolescents (Primary Data Collection) Summary
Study short name and title:
A Prospective Active Surveillance Study to Monitor the Real-World Safety of Ritlecitinib 
Among Adolescents with Alopecia Areata
Rationale and study objectives:
The available nonclinical data for ritlecitinib do not suggest a risk associated with growth and 
development in patients ≥12 years old. However, the potential impact of the long-term use of 
ritlecitinib on growth and bone development, and maturation and pubertal development. is 
considered missing information. Neurotoxicity is an important potential risk. Therefore, at
the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee’s (PRAC’s) request, a long-term follow-
up study will be conducted to actively monitor growth and development (including bone 
fractures), maturation and pubertal development, and neurotoxicity (as evaluated via 
neurological events of interest) associated with exposure to ritlecitinib in adolescents aged 
Page 117
117
Ritlecitinib
Risk Management Plan
July 2023
12-17 years in the post-approval setting. This study is designated as a Post-Authorisation 
Safety Study (PASS) and is a commitment to the EMA. 
The primary objectives are to:
 Describe growth and bone development metrics among adolescent patients treated 
with ritlecitinib and, separately, among adolescent patients with AA who are unexposed 
to ritlecitinib, including those exposed to other approved systemic treatments for AA; 
 Describe maturation and pubertal development metrics among adolescent patients 
treated with ritlecitinib and, separately, among adolescent patients with AA who are 
unexposed to ritlecitinib, including those exposed to other approved systemic treatments 
for AA; and
 Estimate the incidence rate of neurological events of interest among adolescent 
patients treated with ritlecitinib and, separately, among adolescent patients with AA who 
are unexposed to ritlecitinib, including those exposed to other approved systemic 
treatments for AA. 
Exploratory objectives are to:
 Compare growth and bone development metrics among adolescent patients treated 
with ritlecitinib with adolescent patients with AA who are unexposed to ritlecitinib, 
including those exposed to other approved systemic treatments for AA; 
 Compare maturation and pubertal development metrics among adolescent patients 
treated with ritlecitinib with adolescent patients with AA who are unexposed to 
ritlecitinib, including those exposed to other approved systemic treatments for AA; and
 Compare the incidence rate of neurological events of interest among adolescent 
patients treated with ritlecitinib to the incidence rate among adolescent patients with AA 
who are unexposed to ritlecitinib, including those exposed to other approved systemic 
treatments for AA.
Study design:
This will be a prospective observational cohort study of ritlecitinib-exposed AA adolescent 
patients. The study will include primary data collection. 
Study population:
The study will include adolescents (aged 12-17 years) with AA receiving ritlecitinib and 
adolescents with AA who are unexposed to ritlecitinib, including those exposed to other 
approved systemic treatments for AA.

Safety Assessments 
July 2023
This study will collect safety data on growth and bone development, including bone 
fractures, maturation and pubertal development, and pre-specified neurological events of 
interest. Growth and bone development will be assessed by physical examinations at each 
registry follow-up visit. Maturation and pubertal development measurements (e.g., Tanner 
Staging) will be self-assessed by the patients at regular intervals throughout follow-up. Bone 
fractures and neurological events will be periodically assessed during follow-up via 
healthcare provider questionnaires. The details of each observed event (neurologic or bone 
fracture) will be collected via questionnaires completed by the treating provider.

Study short name and title:
A Phase 3 Open-Label Multi-Center Long-Term study investigating the Safety and Efficacy 
of ritlecitinib in Adult and Adolescent Participants with Alopecia Areata. (See RMP Part VII 
Annex 3 for protocol amendment 6)
Rationale and Study Objectives
This study is specifically designed to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy 
of ritlecitinib in adults and adolescents.
The primary objectives are:
 To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ritlecitinib in adult and adolescent 
participants with AA.

The secondary objectives are:
July 2023
 To evaluate the long-term efficacy of ritlecitinib in adult and adolescent participants 
with AA
 To evaluate the effect of ritlecitinib on patient-centered outcomes and payer relevant 
measures to assess treatment benefit from the patient perspective and to demonstrate 
value.
Study Design 
This is a Phase 3, open label, multi center, long-term study designed to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of  ritlecitinib (PF 06651600) in adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age with 
AA over a maximum duration of approximately 62 months, with participants continuing after 
the Month 36 visit for a maximum of 24 months or until availability of commercial product 
in their country, or until the sponsor terminates the study in that country, whichever occurs 
first. Eligible participants from the index studies B7931005 and B7981015 are given the 
opportunity to enroll, as well as approximately 450 de novo participants (ie, those who have 
not previously received study intervention in Study B7931005 or B7981015). Participants 
enrolling from the index studies receive open label 50 mg QD ritlecitinib for up to 60 months 
and de novo participants receive open label 200 mg ritlecitinib QD for 4 weeks followed by 
open-label 50 mg QD ritlecitinib for up to 59 months.
Study Population
All participants (in adults and adolescents ≥12) in this study, including those who 
participated in a qualifying index study and de novo participants, must have met protocol 
eligibility criteria. 
Safety Assessments 
Safety will be assessed by the spontaneous reporting of AEs, physical examinations, 
audiological evaluations and clinical laboratory results in all subjects who receive at least one 
dose of the study intervention.  This study will collect safety data for the safety concerns (as 
outlined in Table 62), including safety events of interest such as serious infections, 
opportunistic infections, herpes zoster, malignancy, thromboembolic events (including deep 
vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and arterial thrombosis) cardiovascular events, 
neurological and audiological events and pregnancy outcomes.

Ritlecitinib
Risk Management Plan
July 2023
Table 63. Description of Routine Risk Minimisation Measures by Safety Concern
have been appendicitis, COVID-19 infection (including 
pneumonia), and sepsis. Treatment with ritlecitinib should be 
avoided in patients with an active, serious infection. 
Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs 
and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with 
ritlecitinib. Treatment should be interrupted if a patient develops a 
serious or opportunistic infection. A patient who develops a new 
infection during treatment with ritlecitinib should undergo prompt 
and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an 
immunocompromised patient, appropriate antimicrobial therapy 
should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored. 
Prescribers should evaluate whether interrupting treatment for 
alopecia areata is the best course of action for an individual patient. 
Ritlecitinib may be resumed once the infection is controlled. 
As there is a higher incidence of infections in elderly and in the 
diabetic population in general, caution should be exercised when 
treating the elderly and patients with diabetes, and particular 
attention paid with respect to occurrence of infections.
Patients should be screened for tuberculosis and viral hepatitis 
before starting therapy. Use of live attenuated vaccines should be 
avoided during or immediately prior to ritlecitinib therapy. Prior to 
initiating ritlecitinib, it is recommended that patients be brought up 
to date with all immunisations, including prophylactic herpes zoster 
vaccinations, in agreement with current immunisation guidelines.

PART VI. SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for Litfulo
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Litfulo. The RMP details 
important risks of Litfulo how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about Litfulo's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Litfulo's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Litfulo should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Litfulo should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Litfulo's RMP.
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For
Litfulo is indicated for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adults and adolescents 12 
years of age and older. It contains ritlecitinib as the active substance and it is given by oral of 
administration.
Further information about the evaluation of Litfulo’s benefits can be found in Litfulo’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the
medicine’s webpage link to the EPAR summary landing page.
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks
Important risks of Litfulo together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Litfulo's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 

package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 

that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 

or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Litfulo these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.

In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Litfulo is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Litfulo are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there 
is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Litfulo Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (eg on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important Potential Risk: Malignancy
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Clinical study data and understanding of immunomodulatory mechanisms based 
on the data from the JAK class. Adjudicated malignancy events were assessed in 
the ritlecitinib development program.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Malignancies were observed in clinical studies of ritlecitinib. However, there 
were an insufficient number of events for risk factor or subgroup analysis. The 
risks and benefits of ritlecitinib treatment should be considered prior to initiating 
or continuing therapy in patients with a known malignancy (other than a 
successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or cervical cancer).

Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Thrombotic events have been reported in patients receiving ritlecitinib in clinical 
studies. Adjudicated thromboembolic events (venous and arterial) were assessed 
in the ritlecitinib development program.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
There were an insufficient number of cases to analyze risk factors from the 
ritlecitinib clinical trial data. Risk factors for thromboembolic events in the 
general population also apply to patients with AA including older age, obesity, a 
medical history of thromboembolism, prothrombotic disorder, use of combined 
hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, patients undergoing 
major surgery, or prolonged immobilization.

Important Potential Risk: Embryofoetal toxicity following exposure in 
utero
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the medicine
There are limited data from the use of ritlecitinib in human pregnancy. Studies in 
animals have shown developmental toxicity with no effects at clinically relevant 
exposures. 
In an embryo-foetal development study in pregnant rats, oral administration of 
ritlecitinib from gestation days 6 to 17 resulted in foetal skeletal malformations 
and variations and lower foetal body weights at exposures greater than or equal to 
49 times the unbound AUC at the MRHD. There were no effects on embryo-foetal 
development at exposures equal to 16 times the unbound AUC at the MRHD.
In an embryo-foetal development study in pregnant rabbits, oral administration 
of ritlecitinib from gestation days 7 to 19 resulted in lower mean foetal body 
weights and higher incidences of visceral malformations, skeletal malformations, 
and skeletal variations at exposures equal to 55 times the unbound AUC at the 
MRHD. There were no effects on embryo-foetal development at exposures equal 
to 12 times the unbound AUC at the MRHD.
In a rat pre- and postnatal development study, oral administration of ritlecitinib 
from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20 resulted in developmental toxicity 
that included lower postnatal survival, lower offspring body weights, and 
secondary developmental delays at exposure equal to 41 times the unbound AUC 
at the MRHD. Bred females in the F1 generation exhibited lower mean numbers 
of corpora lutea at exposures equal to 41 times the unbound AUC at the MRHD. 
There were no effects on pre- and postnatal development at exposures equal to 
14 times the unbound AUC at the MRHD.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk of foetal malformation pertains only to women of childbearing potential who 
become pregnant while receiving ritlecitinib. There were no cases reported of 
Embryofoetal toxicity.

Table 71.
Important Potential Risk: MACE
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the medicine
Events of venous and arterial thromboembolism including MACE, have been 
reported in patients receiving ritlecitinib.
It is not known whether JAK3 inhibition may be associated with all adverse 
reactions of non-selective JAK inhibition. In a large randomised active-controlled 
study of tofacitinib (another JAK inhibitor) in RA patients 50 years and older with 
at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of MACE, defined 
as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke, and 
a dose dependent higher rate of venous thromboembolism including DVT and PE 
were observed with a JAK inhibitor compared to TNF inhibitors.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
There was an insufficient number of events in the ritlecitinib development 
program for formal risk factor or subgroup analysis. Age ≥65 years, current or 
past smoking history, and a history of atherosclerotic disease are risk factors for 
MACE in patients treated with JAK class inhibitors.

Evidence for linking 
the risk to the medicine
Ritlecitinib-related axonal dystrophy has been observed in chronic Beagle dog 
toxicity studies (see section 5.3). Treatment with ritlecitinib should be 
discontinued in case unexplained neurological symptoms occur.

ANNEX 6. DETAILS OF PROPOSED ADDITIONAL RISK MINIMISATION 
ACTIVITIES (IF APPLICABLE)
Draft key messages of the additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of ritlecitinib in each Member State, the MAH must agree about the 
content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National 
Competent Authority.
The educational programme is aimed at increasing awareness about the safety concerns of 
the product, specifically in regard to infections (including herpes zoster and serious 
infections and opportunistic infections), thromboembolic events including deep vein 
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and arterial thrombosis, MACE, malignancy, neurotoxicity
and embryo-foetal toxicity following exposure in utero.
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where ritlecitinib is marketed, all 
healthcare professionals and patients/carers who are expected to prescribe, dispense or use 
Litfulo have access to/are provided with the following educational package:
The physician educational material should contain:
 The Summary of Product Characteristics
 Package leaflet
 Healthcare Professional Guide
 Patient Card (PC)
The Healthcare Professional Guide shall contain the following key elements:
 Language for healthcare providers (HCPs) to inform patients of the importance of the 
PC.
 Potential risk of infections (including herpes zoster and serious infections or 
opportunistic infections)
o Describe that Litfulo must not be used in patients with an active, serious 
infection.
o Language on the risk of infections during treatment with Litfulo.
o Language recommending that risk factors for infections should be considered 
when prescribing ritlecitinib including elderly age and diabetes.
o Details on how to reduce the risk of infection with specific clinical measures 
(what laboratory parameters should be used to initiate Litfulo, screening for TB, 
and screening for viral hepatitis and temporary interruption of Litfulo if an 
infection is not responding to appropriate therapy until the infection is 
controlled).
o Language stating the use of live, attenuated vaccines should be avoided during or 
immediately prior to treatment along with examples of live, attenuated vaccines.
 Potential risk of thromboembolic events including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism and arterial thrombosis
Page 1
159
Ritlecitinib
Risk Management Plan
Part VII: Annex 6
o Language describing that events of venous and arterial thromboembolism, 
including MACE, have been observed in studies in Litfulo.
o Details of how to reduce the potential risk: Litfulo should be used with caution in 
patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism. In patients with a 
suspected thromboembolic event, discontinuation of Litfulo and prompt re 
evaluation is recommended. The risks and benefits of treatment should be 
considered prior to initiating Litfulo therapy in patients.
 Potential risk of malignancy
o Language describing that malignancies, including non-melanoma skin cancer, 
have been observed in studies with Litfulo.
o Details of how to reduce the potential risk with specific clinical measures (that the 
risks and benefits of Litfulo treatment should be considered prior to initiating in 
patients with a known malignancy or when considering continuing Litfulo therapy 
in patients who develop a malignancy, and that periodic skin examination is 
recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer).
 Potential risk of neurotoxicity
o Language describing that ritlecitinib-related axonal dystrophy has been observed 
in chronic Beagle dog toxicity studies at systemic exposures of at least 7.4-times 
the expected exposure in patients treated with 50 mg per day. At a systemic 
exposure that was 33-times above the expected exposure in patients treated with 
50 mg per day, axonal dystrophy was associated with neurological hearing loss. 
While these findings proved to reverse after dosing cessation of ritlecitinib in 
dogs, a risk to patients at a chronic dosing regimen cannot be fully excluded. 
Available clinical data has not indicated an effect on neurological or audiological 
outcomes.
o Details on how to reduce the risk neurotoxicity, treatment with Litfulo should be 
discontinued in case unexplained neurological symptoms occur.
 Potential risk of embryo-foetal toxicity following exposure in utero
o Language describing there are no or limited data on the use of Litfulo in pregnant 
women.
o Details on how to reduce the risk of exposure during pregnancy for women of 
childbearing potential based on the following: Litfulo is contraindicated during 
pregnancy, women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective 
contraception both during treatment and for 1 month following cessation of 
Litfulo, and to advise patients to inform their HCP immediately if they think they 
could be pregnant or if pregnancy is confirmed.
The patient information pack should contain:
 Package leaflet
 Patient card
 The patient card shall contain the following key messages:
o ‘Language describing Litfulo (i.e. what it is and what it is used for).
o Contact details of the Litfulo prescriber.

Ritlecitinib
Risk Management Plan
Part VII: Annex 6
o Language that the PC should be carried by the patient at any time and to share it 
with HCPs involved in their care (i.e., non- Litfulo prescribers, emergency room 
HCPs, etc.).
o Description of signs/symptoms of infections the patient needs to be aware of, so 
that they can seek attention from their HCP:
 Language to advise patients and their HCPs about the risk of live 
vaccinations when given immediately before and during Litfulo
therapy with examples of live vaccines.
o Reminder of the risk of cancer. Regarding skin cancer reminder to let their doctor 
know if they notice any new growth on the skin.
o Description of signs/symptoms of  thromboembolic events including blood clots 
in the veins (deep vein thrombosis), or in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) and 
blood clots in an artery (arterial thrombosis), in the heart (heart attack), in the 
brain (stroke) or in the eye (profound vision loss in one eye) which the patient 
needs to be aware of, so that they can seek immediate attention from an HCP.
o Language that treatment with Litfulo should be discontinued in case unexplained 
neurological symptoms occur.
o Language that there are no or limited data on the use of Litfulo in pregnant 
women.
o Language describing on how to reduce the risk of exposure during pregnancy for 
women of childbearing potential based on the following:
 Litfulo is contraindicated during pregnancy, women of childbearing 
potential should be advised to use effective contraception both during 
treatment and for 1 month following cessation of Litfulo, and to advise 
patients to inform their HCP immediately if they think they could be 
pregnant or if pregnancy is confirmed.
 A reminder to use contraception, that Litfulo is contraindicated during 
pregnancy, and to notify their HCPs if they become pregnant while 
taking Litfulo.

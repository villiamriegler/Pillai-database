1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, Annex 
The information on anti-drug antibodies in section 4.8 of

the SmPC was updated with the submission of data from 
Update section 4.8 of the SmPC with the submission 
of  data from Study 0761-010 for ADA based on the 
revised assay as requested by the CHMP in order to 
review the revised data, and a reanalysis of the 
effect of ADA on safety, efficacy and mogamulizumab 
PK of subjects previously considered “inconclusive” 
now resulting in ADA positive. Update of section 4.6 
to remove the statement on contraception 
requirements for male subjects/patients from the 
product information. The PL is updated accordingly. 
Study 0761-010 for ADA based on the revised assay as 
requested by the CHMP. Following the review of the revised 
data, and a reanalysis of the effect of ADA on safety, 
efficacy and mogamulizumab PK of subjects previously 
considered “inconclusive” now resulting in ADA positive. 
Therefore it is now reflected in the SmPC that following 
infusion of POTELIGEO during clinical studies of the use of 
POTELIGEO in patients with adult T-cell leukaemia-
lymphoma or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, approximately 
14% of patients (44 out of 313 evaluable patients) tested

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive, degenerative neurologic disorder characterized by a loss of 
dopamine-containing neurons in the basal ganglia.  PD causes motor symptoms including resting tremor, 
rigidity,  bradykinesia  and  postural  instability,  as  well  as  non-motor  symptoms  including  cognitive 
impairment,  mood  disorders,  sleep  dysfunction,  fatigue,  pain,  gastrointestinal  (GI)  dysmotility  and 
urinary dysfunction. Both motor and non-motor symptoms can have a substantial negative impact on a 
patient’s quality of life and activities of daily living (ADL).  
Motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) occur with disease progression, when patients are no longer able to 
store dopamine in dopaminergic neurons, due to their progressive degeneration.   
OFF episodes may present in several forms.  “End-of-dose” or “wearing-off” episodes are commonly the 
first to be experienced by PD patients during the course of their chronic illness. These are frequently 
predictable  and  occur  towards  the  end  of  the  levodopa  (LD)  inter-dosing  interval.    A  second  major 
category of motor fluctuations entails random fluctuations that are not predictable based on the LD dosing 
schedule. Such ON/OFF episodes may occur without warning. Other types of motor fluctuations have also 
been described (e.g., “early-morning-OFF”). The onset of motor fluctuations may be accompanied by a 
variety of motor, sensory and/or autonomic symptoms, the development of which impacts greatly on a 
patient’s quality of life. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
PD affects more than 1.2 million people in Europe and the prevalence is expected to double by 2030. The 
average age of onset of disease is 60 years while more than 1 in 10 people are diagnosed before the age 
of 50 years. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
PD is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia. Levodopa (LD), the metabolic 
precursor to dopamine, is readily able to cross the blood-brain barrier, where it is converted to dopamine 
in the central nervous system.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Many people with Parkinson’s fluctuate between ON states during which their symptoms are controlled 
and OFF episodes (also known as OFF periods) when their symptoms return.  OFF periods may occur even 
when patients are taking their usual LD/carbidopa (CD) Parkinson’s regimen and are typically seen in 
more advanced PD, i.e. Parkinson with motor fluctuations. OFF episodes may present in several forms. 
“End-of-dose” or “wearing-off” episodes are commonly the first to be experienced by PD patients during 
the course of their chronic illness. These are frequently predictable and occur towards the end of the LD 
inter-dosing interval.  A second major category of motor fluctuations entails random fluctuations that are 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 11/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not predictable based on the LD dosing schedule. Such ON/OFF episodes may occur without warning. 
Other types of motor fluctuations have also been described (e.g., “early-morning-OFF”). The onset of 
motor fluctuations may be accompanied by a variety of motor, sensory and/or autonomic symptoms, the 
development of which impacts greatly on a patient’s quality of life.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Treatment of an OFF episode is managed most frequently by oral administration of a scheduled or 
unscheduled dose of LD, which is associated with considerable variability in response and can require one 
hour or more to improve motor function.  
Currently there is another product, subcutaneous apomorphine (APO-go), on the marked allowing 
fine-tuning of the daily L-dopa however, the pharmacodynamics of this product were not assessed.  
APO-go is currently used for the acute, intermittent treatment of motor fluctuations (‘ON-OFF’ 
phenomena) in patients with PD which are not sufficiently controlled by oral anti-Parkinson medication. 
These patients are generally in more advanced PD stages.  
About the product 
Inbrija (CVT-301, levodopa inhalation powder) is a dry powder formulation of LD for inhalation. Capsules 
contain powder for oral inhalation and breath-actuated inhaler. The combination of particle size and 
formulation composition has been designed to provide therapeutic levels of LD following inhalation and 
absorption into the pulmonary circulation. The formulation contains the inactive ingredients sodium 
chloride (NaCl) and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The Inbrija formulation consists of levodopa, 
DPPC and NaCl. Inbrija is given on top of background LD/CD therapy, so the current formulation does not 
contain CD.  
Inbrija is delivered to the lung using a proprietary, capsule-based, breath-actuated inhaler that has been 
used previously in patients in clinical trials to deliver other medications. The inhaler is capable of 
delivering therapeutics over a range of inspiratory flow rates. The Inbrija inhaler is approximately 13 cm 
long and is composed of plastic parts and stainless steel parts. 
For dose administration, the capsule is placed in the inhaler and punctured during a simple actuation 
process. The patient inhales the powder contents of the capsule through the mouthpiece. The inhaler can 
be loaded, operated, and unloaded multiple times. Data from in vitro testing shows the inhaler is capable 
of delivering the desired dose of 33.4 mg of LD of the 42mg capsule over a wide range of flow rates from 
20 to 90 L/min. In Study CVT-301-002, peak inspiratory flow rates were evaluated in PD patients and 
ranges of 39 to 98 L/min were seen in the ON state and 29 to 98 L/min in the OFF state. Therefore, PD 
patients generate sufficient flow rates to receive the desired dose. 
The Inbrija inhaler used in the Phase 1 Study CVT-301-001 and Phase 2a Study CVT-301-002 was 
updated before the Phase 2b CVT-301-003 to improve the reliability of the staple retention mechanism 
and to change the colour of the housing from green to blue; all other characteristics, including the 
geometry of the gas flow path, were unchanged. No further changes were made to the inhaler between 
the Phase 2b Study CVT-301-003 and the Phase 1 high-dose pharmacokinetic Study CVT-301-006. 
Some inhaler external design features were optimized prior to Phase 3, such as adding a removable dust 
cap. The final commercial version of the inhaler was used in the Phase 3 clinical studies; the geometry of 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 12/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
the gas flow path and capsule puncture mechanism will not be changed, nor will the materials of 
construction be altered. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended - complete and independent application. 
Inbrija clinical development program followed recommendations received from medical experts and the 
US FDA and has been aligned to the clinical  Phase 2  and  3 efficacy  studies supporting  registration  of 
subcutaneous apomorphine in PD (e.g., Menon and Stacy 2007, Stacy and Silver 2008). The Committee 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in 
the treatment of PD (EMA/CHMP/330418/2012 rev. 2) has also been considered. 
Scientific Advice on the clinical aspects of the late-stage Inbrija development program pertained to the 
adequacy of the single pivotal Phase 3 study to support the MAA (patient population, study duration, 
endpoints  statistical  approach,  treatment  duration,  characterisation  and  selection  of  doses);  the 
adequacy  of  the  long-term  safety  and  special  population  studies;  the  justification  not  to  conduct  a 
thorough QT study; the proposed safety database (number of patients and duration of treatment).

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of levodopa is (2S)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, corresponding 
to the molecular formula C9H11NO4 and it has a relative molecular mass 197.2 g/mol and the following 
structure: 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 13/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
Levodopa is a white or almost white, non-hygroscopic crystalline powder.  
Levodopa has an enantiomer referred as impurity D in Ph. Eur. No polymorphic forms are reported in 
literature. Since the active substance is completely dissolved during the manufacture of the finished 
product (at the beginning of the spray drying process) the applicant has not provided characterisation 
data of the solid properties of the active substance. This is accepted. 
As there is a monograph of levodopa in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active 
substance has been granted Certificates of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) which have 
been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Levodopa is supplied by one manufacturer. The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM 
before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  two  plastic  bags  inside  a  fibre  drum.  The  first  bag  (primary 
packaging)  is  made  from  linear  low-density  polyethylene,  which  complies  with  the  EC  directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR), appearance of solution, pH 
(potentiometric, Ph. Eur.), assay (potentiometric titration, Ph.Eur.), impurities (HPLC, Ph.Eur.), 
enantiomeric purity (HPLC, Ph.Eur.) loss on drying (Ph.Eur.) and sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.). 
The control tests are carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph. An additional related substance (L-Veratrylglycine) is specified in line with the USP 
monograph. 
The applicant's specification does not include a limit for microbial purity; its absence has been justified in 
line with ICH Q6A: the active substance is not capable of supporting microbial growth or viability. 
Physical properties of the active substance which could impact product performance of a dry powder 
inhaler such as particle size, polymorphic form and powder morphology are not of relevance for control of 
the levodopa, because the active substance is completely dissolved during the manufacture of the 
finished product; this justification is provided at section 3.2.P.2 - Pharmaceutical development. The 
specifications are appropriate to control the quality of the active substance. 
Batch analysis data (10 batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored 
in the intended commercial package for up to 48 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines

were provided. Results on photostability testing, following the ICH guideline Q1B, and on stress 
conditions thermal (heat), acidic, and alkaline were also provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance of solution, related substances, enantiomeric purity, 
loss on drying, assay, and pH. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were 
stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months, no special storage 
conditions, in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as an inhalation powder, hard capsule, containing 42 mg of levodopa 
(each delivered dose contains 33 mg levodopa per capsule). The inhalation powder is a new dosage form 
of  levodopa  (drug  and  device  combination  product)  designed  to  provide  orally-inhaled  delivery  of 
levodopa using a proprietary capsule-based, breath-actuated inhaler. 
The  capsules  contain  levodopa  inhalation  powder,  composed  of  a  mixture  of  levodopa  , 
1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and sodium chloride (NaCl), filled into white, 
size  00  hydroxypropyl  methylcellulose  (HPMC)  capsules  in  product  strength  42  mg  (33  mg  delivered 
dose) levodopa per capsule. The composition of the printing ink is provided. 
NaCl  and  DPPC  are  the  two  only  excipients  administered  to  the  patients.  NaCl  is  a  well-known 
pharmaceutical  ingredient.  DPPC  is  a  non-compendial  excipient; the  applicant  has  provided  adequate 
justification,  in  response  to  a  major  objection  raised  during  the  procedure,  that  DPPC  is  not  a  novel 
excipient.  Toxicological  studies  have  been  provided  demonstrating  that,  in  its  selected  content,  it  is 
considered  safe.  The  excipients  used  to  manufacture  the  capsule  and  are  well  known,  standard 
pharmaceutical excipients. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 
2.2.1 of this report.  
Compatibility between the active substance and the two excipients, sodium chloride and DPPC, was 
established by conducting forced degradation studies and stability studies on the formulation, monitoring 
both chemical and physical properties of the finished product at long-term (25ºC/60%RH) and 
accelerated conditions (40ºC/75%RH).  
The intent of pharmaceutical development was to overcome the obstacles inherent to oral delivery of 
levodopa by developing a powder for oral inhalation.  
A Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) was developed which included considerations of the patient 
population, the need to rapid uptake to systemic circulation, the stability of the drug substance, and the 
relevant physicochemical parameters that will affect the performance of the drug product. From the 
QTTP, the following Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) were identified: identification, assay, related 
substances, water content, residual solvents, aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD), content 
uniformity of the pre-metered dose and emitted dose.  
Formulation development focused on producing a manufacturable powder with the desired fine particle 
and emitted dose, while minimising the amount excipients to reduce the amount of inhaled powder, and 
reduce the number of inhalations needed per dose. In this manner, the levodopa:DPPC:NaCl formulation 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 15/87 
 
  
 
 
 
was selected and has not changed since the initiation of toxicological and clinical studies. The formulation 
used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. 
The powder is comprised of large porous particles, with a high degree of dispersibility, which are capable 
of efficient delivery to and deposition in the lung. 
The powder is produced by spray-drying followed by capsule filling and packaging.  
The  formulation  and  manufacturing  development  have  been  evaluated  through  the  use  of  risk 
assessment  and  design  of  experiments  to  identify  the  critical  product  quality  attributes  and  critical 
process parameters. A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method 
in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that may have an influence on the finished 
product  quality  attributes.  The  risk  identification  was  based  on  the  experience  from  formulation 
development, process  design and scale-up studies. The critical process  parameters (CPPs) have  been 
adequately  identified.  The  supporting  justification  of  the  spray-drying  incudes  full  APSD  data  and  is 
acceptable.  While  the  overall  principles  of  the  process  are  unchanged  from  Phase  1  studies  to  the 
proposed  commercial  process,  the  individual  process  parameters  and  scales  have  been  modified.  A 
discussion is provided on the development of these parameters at each clinical phase and it is adequate. 
The applicant has adequately described all aspects applicable to inhalation powders that are mentioned in 
the  Guideline  on  the  Pharmaceutical  Quality  of  Inhalation  and  Nasal  Products.  The  applicant  has 
sufficiently demonstrated that the batches used in the clinical study and the batches manufactured in 
accordance with the proposed commercial process will behave similar and have comparable deposition 
patterns (APSD and fine particle dose). 
The primary packaging material, Aluminium / PVC / Aluminium peel-off blisters, was selected based on 
the requirements for protection of the finished product capsules from moisture, compatibility/safety of 
the materials of construction, and performance of the materials over shelf life. The material complies with 
Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. A summary of the interaction studies carried out on the packaging 
components is provided and considered adequate. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
The finished product powder is delivered using a proprietary breath-actuated inhaler, which is designed to 
puncture and disperse the levodopa inhalation powder from a capsule. The inhaler is made of 
polybutylene terephthalate, polycarbonate and polypropylene. Puncturing tines and springs are made 
from stainless steel. The inhalation device is CE marked and well-known. The Essential Requirements List 
of Annex 1 of the Medical device Directive has been provided. The inhaler has not been significantly 
modified since Phase 1 studies began and the inhaler used in Phase 3 studies is functionally identical to 
that proposed for commercial use. Similarly, there have been no relevant changes to the manufacturing 
process of the inhaler since Phase 3. Pharmaceutical development studies have been carried out on the 
finished product as per the Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal Products 
(EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr) and all the required aspects have been discussed, supported by 
sufficient data that is in line with the guideline, including the inhaler development studies. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: spray drying, encapsulation, and packaging. The 
process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The powder is produced by spray-drying a defined-ratio mixture of aqueous stock solution (containing 
levodopa  and  NaCl)  and  an  organic  stock  solution  (containing  DPPC)  to  produce  levodopa  inhalation 
powder. The powder for inhalation is automatically filled into white HPMC capsules size 00 (pre-printed 
with a commercial print) to the target fill weight under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 16/87 
 
  
 
 
 
The  filled  capsules  are  individually  packaged  into  a  heat-sealed  foil-foil  blister  under  controlled 
temperature and humidity conditions.  
A  detailed  description  of  the  manufacturing  process  is  provided  in  line  with  the  pharmaceutical 
development section. Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs) are proposed for each step of the manufacture of 
the medicinal product based on design-of-experiment activities. In the manufacturing process, the ratio 
of feeds for spray-drying, feed filters, and measures used to dissipate the build-up of electrostatic charge 
are defined. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from 
commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs.  The holding  times and  quality  of the  hold 
container closure systems are laid down in the process description and are acceptable.  
The applicant had initially provided process validation data only on the spray-drying step. Although this is 
the  most  complex  step  of  the  manufacture  of  an  inhalation  powder  that  is  pre-metered,  since  it 
determines the APSD of the powder, a major objection was raised to request full process validation data 
for all manufacturing steps. Process validation was performed on the spray-drying operation and on the 
subsequent filling step and packaging step for four consecutive production batches manufactured at the 
same batch size and manufacturing process as the intended commercial-scale batches. Capsule target fill 
weight  is  included  as  IPC  in  the  dossier.  No  validation  results  regarding  this parameter  are  included, 
however, the active substance content was tested during filling and the results are well within the product 
release limits. For the packaging step, adequate results are provided for the seal integrity of the blister, 
among others.  
Two GMP major objections were raised during the procedure. The first major objection was in reference to 
proof of demonstration of GMP compliance for the USA based finished product manufacturer. This was 
resolved when FDA conducted a pre-approval inspection, also on behalf of EMA, which was finalised with 
a  positive  outcome.  The  second  GMP  major  objection  was  in  reference  to  the  GMP  control  testing 
arrangements which has been addressed by removing non EU-based control testing and adding EU-sites 
with valid MIA. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
(appearance, identity, assay, impurities, water content, residual solvent content, content uniformity of 
pre-metered dose, mean delivered dose,  delivered dose  uniformity, emitted dose,  APSD  by  Andersen 
Cascade Impactor method, microscopic evaluation of the emitted powder, powder morphology (XRPD), 
foreign particulates, microbial enumeration and specified organisms). 
The presented specification covers the parameters required by EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr, as 
well as including additional testing that is considered appropriate for an inhaled product delivered to the 
systemic circulation via the lung (such as multiple controls of particle size, as well as the physical form). 
The justification of specification takes into consideration the results of clinical batches and is considered 
acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities, ‘inhalation’ category. Batch 
analysis data on the stability batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that 
each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 17/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 27 representative 42 mg product batches (pivotal clinical and 
stability batches manufactured at least 20% of the proposed commercial scale) batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from one commercial scale batch and three pilot (semi-production) scale batches of finished 
product stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 12 months 
under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are representative to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  impurities,  water  content,  emitted  dose,  APSD,  microscopic 
evaluation  of  the  emitted  powder,  powder  morphology  (XRPD),  and  microbial  limits  (microbial 
enumeration and specified microorganisms). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No 
significant changes have been observed during the long term stability studies.  
Small changes on  powder morphology and  water  content  were observed during  the intermediate  and 
accelerated conditions stability studies, the changes are not likely to have a significant effect on efficacy 
and safety of the product when used according to the directions in the SmPC. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in 
the European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be 
reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Forced degradation studies have been carried out under acid, base, oxidative, thermolytic and photolytic 
conditions and demonstrate the stability-indicating nature of the assay and impurity methods. Some 
degree of degradation is noted under each condition, with it being more pronounced under base and 
thermal conditions. 
The Ph.Eur. monograph for Levodopa states that it should be stored protected from light. Hence, ICH Q1B 
photo-stability stability studies have not been performed by the applicant; however, since the active 
substance is not stable to light, the finished products should be stored protected from light, as indicated 
in the SmPC. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and storage conditions (Store 
below 25°C. Store in the original package in order to protect from light and moisture and remove 
immediately before use.) as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. Inbrija has been developed 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 18/87 
 
  
 
 
and characterised, including its aerodynamic performance through its shelf-life, in line with the current 
requirements for inhalation products also taking into consideration its systemic effect. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
As the efficacy and nonclinical safety of orally administered levodopa has been well-established, an 
abbreviated nonclinical program was conducted, focusing on the new oral inhalation route of 
administration and contains original studies as well as published literature. 
A nonclinical pharmacology study was conducted to compare the effects of levodopa following oral 
administration and intratracheal insufflation in the rodent model of Parkinson’s disease and 6 
safety/toxicology studies utilising CVT-301 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) with the same 
composition as the to be marketed commercial formulation. Further studies to assess the safety of the 
primary excipient DPPC have also been submitted. For sections for which no data has been generated with 
Inbrija additional relevant information on levodopa was provided from a review of the literature. 
Scientific Advice was received CHMP on the acceptability of the non-clinical programme to support a new 
route of administration and new presentation of an established drug substance, and the confirmation that 
the safety margins and the approach to the testing of the excipients within the formulation were 
acceptable.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Levodopa  is  converted  in  the  brain  into  dopamine,  which  reduces  the  symptoms  of  OFF  periods  in 
Parkinson’s disease as an adjunct to a LD/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (DDI) regimen.  
The  applicant  has  submitted  a  single  non-GLP  compliant  in  vivo  proof  of  concept  study  utilising  a 
unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion rodent model of Parkinson’s disease. The data presented 
demonstrate that levodopa delivered via pulmonary insufflation (not in the proposed clinical formulation) 
results in a more rapid and robust rise in blood L-dopa levels in rats and is associated with more rapid 
attenuation of 6-OHDA induced deficits in  performance  in a number of  behavioural tasks designed to 
assess contralateral limb function relative to orally administered levodopa. This study provides sufficient 
rationale to suggest a more rapid onset of action of levodopa following pulmonary administration. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The applicant has not conducted any specific secondary pharmacodynamic studies on levodopa, but has 
instead provided a summary of recent literature on the topic. The majority of secondary pharmacologic 
effects of levodopa identified in the literature search are attributable to the effects of dopamine rather 
than levodopa itself. Levodopa shows a potential neuroprotective effect, may enhance recovery of lost 
brain  function,  and  may  also  act  as  an  immunomodulator  with  inhibitory  effects  on  cytotoxic  T-cell 
accumulation and inflammatory cytokine production in the ischemic hemisphere of the post-stroke brain. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
According  to  literature,  levodopa  may  cause  both  hypotensive  and  vasoconstrictive  effects  in  animal 
models. In rats with 6-OHDA lesions, levodopa administration resulted in vascular endothelial growth 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 20/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
factor-dependent  microvascular  plasticity  and  local  blood  brain  barrier  increased  permeability.  No 
nonclinical studies citing a direct effect of levodopa on pulmonary function were identified. 
A  GLP-compliant  cardiovascular  and  pulmonary  safety  pharmacology  study  in  conscious,  telemetered 
male dogs administered 9.9 mg/kg levodopa via oronasal (facemask) inhalation for 60 minutes revealed 
no test article-related effects on any cardiovascular (hemodynamic or electrocardiographic) or respiratory 
endpoints. The exposure achieved after a dose of 10 mg/kg in dogs will be approximately the same as 
clinical exposure. 
A literature search did not identify any relevant references directly relating to untoward Central Nervous 
System (CNS) effects of inhalation-administered levodopa. The applicant did not conduct any nonclinical 
CNS safety pharmacology studies, however inhalation repeat-dose toxicity studies (28-days in docs and 
6-months  in  rats)  did  not  reveal  behavioural  abnormalities  including  general  condition,  appearance, 
activity and behaviour. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The applicant did not conduct any dedicated non-clinical PD interaction studies. Levodopa is subject to a 
number  of  well-characterized  pharmacodynamics  drug  interactions  that  are  exploited  to  either  help 
modulate  central  dopamine  (DA)  availability  (e.g.  inhibitors  of  L-aromatic  amino  acid  decarboxylase 
(AAAD), Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) or Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B)) or directly mitigate 
PD  symptoms  (e.g.  DA  agonists).  Since  the  inhalation  route  of  administration  is  not  expected  to 
substantially alter the known pharmacologic profile of levodopa once in the systemic circulation the same 
pharmacodynamics drug interactions of levodopa in the approved products should apply to the use of 
Inbrija. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile in terms of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of 
orally administered levodopa has been extensively studied and well-established. No dedicated nonclinical 
ADME studies were conducted with Inbrija. 
Administration of Inbrija via the pulmonary route provides rapid absorption of levodopa into the systemic 
circulation. Once in the bloodstream, the overall distribution, metabolism, and excretion of levodopa 
following pulmonary administration is not expected to be different from the distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion following oral administration of levodopa.  
However, extensive toxicokinetic (TK) analysis was conducted as part of the Inbrija inhalation toxicity 
studies in rats and dogs. 
Methods of analysis 
A suitable and validated method was provided for the quantitative determination of plasma concentration 
of levodopa: liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), validated in rat and dog plasma. 
Samples were analysed using a protein precipitation extraction procedure followed by LC-MS/MS. Plasma 
samples were modified with carbidopa (5 µg/ml) and with metabisulfite treatment to protect levodopa 
from degradation in rat plasma, and to mimic the plasma samples to be provided from the toxicology 
studies.  Recovery  in  both  rat  (67-75%)  and  dog  (64-67%)  plasma  was  low,  however,  since 
reproducibility was within the guidance criteria, this is not considered to impact the assay. The  Lower 
Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) was 25 ng/ml. 
Absorption 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 21/87 
 
  
 
 
 
Specific  nonclinical  absorption  studies  with  Inbrija  have  not  been  conducted.  However,  plasma  TK  of 
CVT-301 was investigated in the repeated dose toxicity studies with once daily inhalation administration 
in rats (28 days or 6 months) and dogs (28 days).  All animals were co-administered with carbidopa. 
CVT-301 was rapidly absorbed following inhalation, with Tmax within 15 (rats) to 30 (dogs) minutes after 
the end of the inhalation period, compared to 30 minutes in humans after inhalation and 30-120 minutes 
following an oral dose of levodopa. Bioavailability of Inbrija following inhalation was not investigated. Oral 
levodopa  is  poorly  absorbed,  especially  when  not  co-administered  with  carbidopa  (30%  without 
carbidopa). 
Apparent  plasma  clearance  (Cl/F)  at  steady  state  in  rats  in  the  inhalation  studies  was  3240-10500 
ml/h/kg. The systemic elimination was fast, with a terminal half-life (t½) of 0.57-2.1h in rats and slightly 
increased  with  increasing  doses.  T1/2  in  humans  was  2.3  hours.  Repeated  inhalation  showed  an 
approximately  dose-proportional  increase  in  the  mean  AUC  and  Cmax  at  steady  state.  There  was  no 
accumulation  (in  rats,  Cmax  and  AUC  decreased  after  repeated  administration;  accumulation  ratios 
varied  between  0.21  and  0.91).  No  clear  and  consistent  pattern  for  gender-related  differences  was 
observed in the studies with Inbrija. 
In  addition,  plasma  pharmacokinetics  of  exploratory  alternative  levodopa  powder  formulations  was 
investigated  in  rats  and  dogs  following  pulmonary  administration  and  compared  to  oral  and  IV 
administration of levodopa. It was shown that plasma levels of levodopa were rapidly elevated following 
pulmonary  administration.  Absorption  was  more  rapid  and  less  variable  when  compared  to  oral 
administration.  Pulmonary  delivery  of  levodopa  resulted  in  higher  Cmax  and  AUC  compared  to  oral 
gavage. This was also shown for Inbrija in humans. 
No data are available to assess the relative contribution of pulmonary and GI absorption to the observed 
systemic  exposure  following  inhalation  administration.  Although  GI  absorption  following  mucociliary 
clearance of non-absorbed LD from the lungs will take place, the contribution of this to observed systemic 
exposures  is  likely  minimal.  The  more  rapid  absorption  and  PD  effects  evident  following  insufflation 
administration suggest that the drug is primarily absorbed through the lungs.  Although characterising 
the relative contribution of each route of absorption following inhalation administration in non-clinical 
species may have been reassuring with regard to local tissue concentrations achieved given the lack of 
such data acquired in repeat dose toxicity studies, it is accepted that the translational relevance of such 
characterisation is questionable. 
Distribution 
The inhalation route is a novel administration route for levodopa. When administered intravenously in 
rats, 14C-L-DOPA is distributed especially to high perfused tissues (kidney > pancreas ~ intestine > liver 
>  adrenal  >  skin  ~  skeletal  muscle  >  lung  >  cardiac  muscle  >  brain  >  blood).  Similar  patterns  are 
observed following oral administration (intestine >> kidney > liver > pancreas > blood > skin > lung > 
adrenal >cardiac muscle ~ skeletal muscle > brain). Levodopa is not highly bound to plasma proteins 
(free  fraction  76±8%  at  a  concentration  of  500  ng/ml).  Specific  nonclinical  distribution  studies  with 
Inbrija have not been conducted. It is agreed that the inhalation route of administration is not expected 
to substantially alter the known distribution profile of levodopa once in the systemic circulation, although 
concentrations  in  lung  tissue  are  expected  to  be  higher  compared  to  other  administration  routes. 
However, in a study with an early levodopa inhalation formulation in rats, it was shown with HPLC that 
more than 95% of the levodopa was cleared (or metabolised) from the lungs at 30 minutes post-dose 
(single intrapulmonary administration). It is unknown to what degree observed systemic exposures are 
related to lung or gastrointestinal routes of absorption. 
It is expected that, similar to other administration routes, only a small amount of levodopa will reach the 
central nervous system after inhalation. Co-administration with a decarboxylase inhibitor will increase the 
amount of levodopa that will pass the blood-brain barrier, although the amount will still be limited. 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 22/87 
 
  
 
 
Metabolism 
Specific  nonclinical  metabolism  studies  with  Inbrija  have  not  been  conducted.  After  oral  absorption, 
levodopa is rapidly transformed to dopamine, which on its turn is quickly metabolized by COMT and MAO 
into 3-O-methyl dopa (3-OMD), 3,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic acid (HVA). 
Co-administration with a decarboxylase inhibitor slows the transformation of levodopa to dopamine. The 
applicant indicates that the inhalation route of administration is not expected to substantially alter the 
known metabolic profile of levodopa once in the systemic circulation. Indeed, in humans, the metabolic 
profile  with  regard  to  the  three  main  metabolites  was  consistent  (both  qualitatively  as  well  as 
quantitatively) with that described following oral administration of LD (see clinical assessment). 
Excretion 
Levodopa is predominantly metabolized via decarboxylation, followed by excretion of metabolites in the 
urine.  Approximately  80%  of  a  radioactively  labelled  dose  was  recovered  within  24  hours  with  the 
principal metabolites (DOPAC and HVA) constituting up to 50% of the administered dose and negligible 
amounts found in faeces.  
Following IV administration of 14C-L-DOPA, 80% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine and 2-3% 
of the radioactivity was recovered in faeces while 85% of the radioactive dose was excreted in the urine 
and 5% of the radioactivity was recovered in the faeces following oral administration of 14C-L-DOPA. 
After  oral  and  intravenous  administration  of  14C-L-DOPA  to  rats,  there  was  minimal  excretion  of 
unchanged L-DOPA in the urine (<1% of urine radioactivity), indicating extensive metabolism of L-DOPA.. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No dedicated pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction studies have been performed with Inbrija, as inhalation 
administration  is  not  expected  to  alter  the  known  drug  interaction  profile  of  LD  once  in  systemic 
circulation. The submitted literature review is considered adequate. The results on the pharmacokinetic 
drug interaction potential are presented in the clinical assessment report. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The applicant has submitted an abridged safety package for Inbrija citing the long history of clinical use 
with a well-established systemic toxicity profile in humans. The submitted safety package for Inbrija 
consists of a literature review of the known systemic toxicity of LD, repeat dose toxicity studies of 6 
months and 28 days duration in rats and dogs respectively to assess the local and general toxicity of the 
proposed Inbrija formulation and a safety assessment of primary excipient DPPC. Literature sources are 
provided for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive and developmental toxicity.   
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies have been conducted with the proposed Inbrija formulation. The applicant 
has presented literature derived LD50 values for non-clinical species. GLP-compliant single dose toxicity 
studies utilising an early stage levodopa inhalation formulation (containing 50% levodopa) administered 
to the lungs have been conducted in Sprague-Dawley rat, Beagle dog and Cynomolgus monkey. No 
significant toxicities were reported in these studies with lung findings including epithelial changes and 
mild inflammation in all three species attributed to the method of administration.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
In  rats,  a  7-day  repeat-dose  administration  of  levodopa  by  nose-only  inhalation  at  doses  up  to  121 
mg/kg/day following oral administration of carbidopa was well tolerated. Test article-related microscopic 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019

findings consisted of minimal focal to multifocal  degeneration of the olfactory epithelium  in the nasal 
turbinates and minimal intra-alveolar haemorrhage in a few animals. Based on their minimal severity and 
very limited distribution, changes in the nasal turbinates and lungs would not be expected to affect organ 
function  and  are  not  considered  adverse  by  the  applicant.  The  highest  dose  was  associated  with  a 
statistically significant but minimal decrease (-6.9% when compared to controls) in absolute testicular 
weight, but no histopathological evaluation had been done.  
A  28  days  repeated  dose  study  in  rats  with  up  to  103  mg/kg/day  showed  statistically  significant 
reductions in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at doses ≥14.1 mg/kg/day (-34% to -42% vs air control), 
and marginal but statistically significant decreases in triglycerides in males at doses ≥14.1 mg/kg/day 
(-31% to -47% vs air control). None of these findings were considered adverse as they were not observed 
at the end of the recovery period and clinical  chemistry effects were not associated with liver weight 
changes or microscopic liver findings. No decrease in testicular weight was found. Oronasal inhalation of 
up to 157 mg/kg/day levodopa for 26 weeks was well tolerated in rats with findings limited to piloerection, 
minimal epithelial thinning and cilia loss at the tracheal bifurcation in all animals, including controls, and 
nasal inflammation associated with powder accumulation. A no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 
157 mg/kg/day levodopa was established, which is about 3 times the human exposure based on AUC. 
In dogs, a 7-day repeat-dose  administration  of levodopa by nose-only inhalation at doses  up to  29.8 
mg/kg/day following oral administration of carbidopa was well tolerated. Achieved doses of ≥13.3 mg/kg 
were associated with high incidence of emesis, but the incidence of emesis declined as study progressed. 
There were no macroscopic or microscopic pathology findings. Emesis is a well-characterized observation 
in dogs following levodopa administration. A 28 days repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs with doses up to 
42 mg/kg/day showed only reversible emesis and a reversible slight decrease in ALT, with probably no 
significant  meaning.  However,  the  exposures  at  this  NOAEL  based  on  AUC  are  about  the  same  as  in 
humans, so there is no exposure margin. 
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
No  new  genotoxic  and  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  product.  Levodopa  is 
considered non-genotoxic and non-carcinogenic. 
A 6-month inhalation study with the product in rats did not show neoplastic or pre-neoplastic lesions. No 
non-clinical carcinogenicity data following long term inhalation administration are available.   
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies on Inbrija were conducted by the applicant. Previous 
studies in rabbits have shown that levodopa alone and in combination with carbidopa cause visceral and 
skeletal  malformations  in  offspring.  In  another  study  levodopa  produced  foetal  toxicity  in  the  rabbit 
demonstrated by decreased litter weights, and an increased incidence of stunted and resorbed foetuses. 
Levodopa has been reported to cross the human placenta. 
Local Tolerance  
Dedicated local tolerance studies have not been conducted by the applicant. Local tolerance was assessed 
as part of the repeat-dose toxicity studies with relatively minor findings observed. In rats after inhalation 
of the product, microscopic findings were observed in respiratory tract tissues (larynx and the lungs), but 
were not considered related to levodopa, but rather to the route of administration. 
Safety margin calculations based on delivered dose per alveolar surface area at the NOAEL exposures are 
14 and 1 relative to a single administration of the proposed human dose and 3 and 0.2 relative to the 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 24/87 
 
  
 
 
maximum recommended human dose for rat and dog respectively. The maximum human dose is split 
over  5  doses  and  therefore  the  margins  following  a  single  exposure  may  be  more  useful  for  the 
assessment  of  potential  local  toxicity  effects.  There  were  no  adverse  effects  on  pulmonary  tissue 
identified  following  inhalation  administration  to  either  species  and  it  is  accepted  that  the  non-clinical 
safety data submitted do not indicate that inhalation administration of Inbrija is associated with adverse 
local toxicity effects. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetics of Inbrija were studied in rats and dogs. Absorption of Inbrija following inhalation 
administration was fast in rats and dogs (Tmax 15-30 minutes after the end of inhalation period), which 
is similar to humans (30 minutes). The apparent plasma clearance (Cl/F) in rats is 3240-10500 ml/h/kg. 
Following single or multiple dosing (once or twice daily for up to 6 months in rats or 28 days in dogs) an 
approximately dose proportional increase in exposure was observed at doses of 11-22 mg/kg in dogs and 
40-180 mg/kg in rats, as well as in humans (60- 84-mg dose, equivalent to 35 mg and 50 mg Fine Particle 
Dose (FPD)). There was no plasma Cmax or AUC accumulation following repeated inhalation of Inbrija in 
rats or dogs (accumulation ratios varied between 0.21 and 0.91 for rats and 0.9-1.7 in dogs). Elimination 
of Inbrija was fast, with elimination half-life ranging from 0.57-2.1 hours in rats and 2.3 hours in humans. 
No clear or consistent gender differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of Inbrija. 
Dependence 
The applicant has provided an adequate review of the non-clinical literature related to the abuse potential 
of LD. The literature provided is limited but does not indicate a significant risk of dependence associated 
with LD administration. LD is a well-established active substance via the oral route with extensive clinical 
experience and hence available clinical data are more relevant for the assessment of this risk, it is noted 
that dopamine dysregulation syndrome and impulse control disorders are recognised undesirable effects 
on levodopa/carbidopa containing products. 
Other toxicity studies 
Studies on impurities 
Three potential organic process-related impurities have been identified: D1, D2, and D3. The actual levels 
of these impurities are each not more than 0.02% in the final drug substance at release or on stability. 
This  level  is  below  the  ICH  Q3A(R2)  reporting  threshold  of  0.05%  (<  2g/day).  Besides,  two 
complementary in silico methodologies to assess the potential mutagenicity of D1, D2, and D3, namely 
DEREK Nexus (rule-based system) and Leadscope FDA Model Applier (LSMA; statistical-based system), 
predicted negative for mutagenicity. 
Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) excipient toxicology 
DPPC is an excipient used in the  Inbrija formulation, and it is currently not approved for use via oral 
inhalation. Although DPPC is endogenous to the human body as a common constituent of cell membranes 
and is found at high levels in the lungs as the majority component of lung surfactant, toxicological studies 
have been performed. 28-Day inhalation toxicity studies in rats and dogs up to 20 mg/kg DPPC did not 
reveal  major  findings  of  concern.  Also,  as  part  of  the  6  months  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  rats,  a 
placebo arm containing 14.4 mg/kg DPPC did not show any toxicity. In silico analysis of DPPC by DEREK 
did  not  reveal  any  new  important  structural  alerts  not  covered  by  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies. 
Exposure multiples based on mg/kg body weight were 4 to 7 times and based on mg/g lung weight 10 to 
13 times. The exposure multiples based on lung weight may be more appropriate since they relate directly 
to possible local lung effects for inhaled DPPC.

Alternative Levodopa inhalation powder formulations 
At  an  early  stage  of  development  single-dose  toxicity  studies  evaluating  the  pulmonary  effects  of  an 
alternative  levodopa  inhalation  powder  formulation  (AIR-L-dopa:  levodopa,  DPPC,  sodium  citrate  and 
calcium  chloride)  were  conducted  in  rats  (up  to  10  mg/kg  levodopa),  dogs  (up  to  50  mg/kg),  and 
monkeys (10 mg/kg). A 14-day repeat-dose inhalation toxicity study using a neat, micronized levodopa 
dry powder was  conducted in dogs (up to 20  mg/kg).  No significant  toxicological effects were  found, 
besides, these studies using alternative levodopa powder formulations are not considered so relevant to 
the clinical safety assessment of Inbrija given the differences in powder formulations and the differences 
in animal administration techniques. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Levodopa is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the 
substance in the environment. Therefore levodopa is not expected to pose a risk for the environment.   
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The marketing authorisation application for Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder, hard capsule) is 
submitted as a full mixed application and consists of both novel data and summaries of bibliographic 
references prepared according to EMA guidelines.  
Pharmacology 
A  nonclinical  pharmacology  study  was  conducted  to  compare  the  effects  of  levodopa  following  oral 
administration and intratracheal insufflation in the rodent model of Parkinson’s disease.  The applicant 
sufficiently showed that when administered pulmonary, the effect of levodopa is more rapid and robust 
than  given  orally  and  at  the  same  time  that  the  amount  of  levodopa  required  to  produce  equivalent 
efficacy is significantly less.  
A safety pharmacology study in dogs does not indicate any effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory 
systems.  No  adverse  effects  on  the  central  nervous  system  are  reported,  and  issues  regarding  drug 
interactions are assumed to be the same as for levodopa given orally. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant showed that absorption after inhalation was more rapid and less variable when compared to 
oral administration. Pulmonary delivery of levodopa resulted in higher Cmax and AUC compared to oral 
gavage. Distribution, metabolism and excretion of levodopa are not expected to be different compared to 
oral administration. 
Toxicology 
In repeat-dose inhalation studies with Inbrija in rats and dogs, no relevant toxic effects were seen at the 
highest doses, which were about three times, respectively equivalent to the proposed human exposure 
based on AUC. Although the safety margins are small, because of the long experience with oral levodopa 
in humans it is not expected that inhalation will pose a serious risk. However, the microscopic findings of 
minimal focal to multifocal degeneration of the olfactory epithelium in the nasal turbinates and minimal 
intra-alveolar haemorrhage in rats, which were not considered adverse by the applicant, might be related 
to human adverse effects like cough, upper respiratory tract infection and throat irritation which were 
reported frequently. The exposure in humans is much shorter and thus more concentrated than in rats. As 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 26/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
opposed to rats and humans, no effects on the respiratory tract were seen in dogs. But possibly this is 
because the amount of levodopa per gram lung weight in the dog is much lesser than that in the rat. 
The new administration route did not show neoplastic or pre-neoplastic lesions in the 6 month rat study, 
and together with the information from literature, Inbrija can be considered non-genotoxic and 
non-carcinogenic. Literature studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. 
There are no impurities of concern and the new excipient DPPC has been thoroughly investigated and 
found non-toxic. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
CHMP considers that the abridged non-clinical program on Inbrija, focusing on assessment of 
pharmacology and safety, specifically related to the inhalation route of administration of levodopa, and 
the published literature, support the marketing authorisation application. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder, CVT-301) is intended to be used as an intermittent (as needed) 
adjunctive therapy to improve motor function in PD patients who continue to experience OFF periods not 
controlled by their standard DDI/LD plus other concomitant PD medication regimens. 
The recommended dose of Inbrija is 2 hard capsules up to 5 times per day each delivering 33 mg 
levodopa. The maximum daily dose of Inbrija should not exceed 10 capsules (330 mg). It is not 
recommended to take more than 2 capsules per OFF period. 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
“Treatment of symptoms of OFF periods in Parkinson’s disease as an adjunct to a dopa-decarboxylase 
inhibitor/levodopa regimen.”  
The approved indication is:  
“Intermittent treatment of episodic motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) in adult patients with Parkinson’s 
disease (PD) treated with a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor.” 
To characterize the pharmacological profile, the safety and therapeutic effects of Inbrija the applicant has 
conducted an extensive clinical program comprising clinical Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and 
special populations (smokers, asthmatics) as well as Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in PD patients on 
standard LD regimens using Inbrija as an adjunctive add-on treatment to reduce OFF period symptoms. 
The applicant sought Scientific Advice on the clinical aspects of the late-stage Inbrija development 
program regarding the design of the pivotal Phase 3 Study CVT-301-004,  the acceptability of the design 
of the long-term safety Studies CVT-301-004E and CVT-301-005, the acceptability of the clinical 
pharmacology program and the acceptability of the safety database.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic  information  on  levodopa  following  inhalation  of  levodopa  dry  powder  (CVT-301 
formulation) was obtained from studies conducted in healthy adult volunteers (studies 001, 006 and 010) 
and in patients with Parkinson (study 002). In addition, pharmacokinetics was evaluated in subjects with 
asthma  (study  008)  and  in  smokers  (study  007)  (see  Table  2).  The  clinical  program  focused  on  the 
characterisation of levodopa pharmacokinetics following inhalation of levodopa.  
The aim of levodopa inhalation powder was to develop a levodopa formulation that could result in fast, 
high  (>400  ng/ml)  levodopa  plasma  concentrations  to  shorten  the  OFF  periods.  No  mass  balance, 
drug/drug  interaction  studies  or  characterisation  of  special  population  were  conducted  and  this  is 
considered acceptable as the pharmacokinetics of levodopa are well known. 
CVT-301 capsules containing 19.6 mg to 42 mg levodopa were used in clinical studies to deliver target 
fine particle dose (FPD) of 10 mg to 25 mg levodopa to the lung. The clinical study reports for earlier 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies (001, 002, and 006) reported the levodopa FPD dose, while the clinical study 
reports for later Phase 1 studies (007, 008, 009, and 010) reported the levodopa capsule dose as is used 
in the label. In this document, all FPDs are identified as ‘mg FPD’ while capsule doses are identified as 
‘mg’. In the pharmacokinetic session usually, the fine particle dose is being used as there were changes 
in levodopa capsule content and emitted dose throughout the clinical program while the targeted fine 
particle dose remained constant.

Two bioanalytical methods 415/25191HV and 415/25716HV were used to determine levodopa plasma 
concentrations. The methods are sufficiently validated and cross-validated.  
Levodopa is extensively metabolized by decarboxylase in the periphery. Therefore, for oral treatment of 
levodopa, levodopa is always co-administered with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor such as carbidopa. 
Following  inhalation,  levodopa  plasma  exposure  was  4-fold  higher  with  carbidopa  pre-treatment  than 
without. Therefore, in all studies in healthy subjects, subjects were pre-treated with carbidopa 50 mg 
every 8 hours the day before levodopa inhalation to inhibit decarboxylase.  As the intended use for inhaled 
levodopa  is  as  an  adjunct  therapy  in  patients  already  on  a  levodopa/carbidopa  regimen,  no  further 
addition of carbidopa is needed for inhaled levodopa in Parkinson patients.

formulation    (Sinemet)  is  shown  in  Figure  2.  Following  inhalation,  levodopa  plasma  concentrations 
increased fast reaching peak plasma concentrations about 30 minutes after administration while Cmax 
was  reached  45-60  min  post-dosing  for  the  oral  formulation  under  fasting  conditions.  When  oral 
carbidopa/levodopa is taken with a meal, the absorption of levodopa is much slower with a tmax of about 
120 min. The rapid increase in levodopa plasma concentration during the first 10 min after inhalation can 
be attributed to absorption in the lung because of the 10 min lag time following oral administration of 
levodopa.

Figure 2: 
Plasma concentration profile of levodopa (0 to 4 hours) following inhalation of 35 mg FPD 
and 50 mg FPD, and oral administration of Sinemet 25 mg/100 mg under fasted conditions in healthy 
volunteers (Study 010) 
Relative bioavailability of the inhaled levodopa was comparable to the oral levodopa administration under 
fasting conditions, but Cmax was approximately 20% lower for inhaled levodopa.  
Exposure of levodopa was dose proportional over the inhaled levodopa dose range tested (10-105 mg 
FPD). Pharmacokinetic bridging between formulations used in early clinical studies and the to-be-market 
formulation was not conducted. In early studies the absorption of levodopa following inhalation seemed 
somewhat faster than for the to-be-market formulation. The early development formulation appeared to 
have a higher fraction of low particles 0.5-2 µm and this might have affected the absorption rate in the 
lungs. Product specifications have been correctly based on the material used in the pivotal studies (see 
quality part).    
The to-be-market formulation of Inbrija has been used in the phase 3 studies in Parkinson patients. 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  levodopa  following  levodopa  inhalation  powder  60  mg  and  84  mg 
(corresponding  to  35  mg  FPD  and  50  mg  FPD,  respectively;  to-be-market  product)  or  oral  levodopa 
(Sinemet,  25  mg/100  mg)  under  fasted  in  healthy  subjects  (study  010)  are  summarised  in  Table  4. 
Following inhalation, levodopa is faster absorbed than following oral administration but there is a high 
inter-subject variability in tmax, ranging from 10 to 120 min, indicating that some subjects may not have 
an optimal inhalation technique and swallow most of the orally inhaled levodopa.

Distribution and elimination half-life of levodopa were similar following administration via inhalation and 
oral route (Table 4). The metabolic profile of levodopa was similar when administered as inhaled CVT-301 
and oral Sinemet (study 006). As carbidopa was present, 3-OMD was the predominant metabolite of 
levodopa regardless of the route of administration. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population (Study 002)  
Study  002  was  a  randomized,  placebo-  and  active-controlled,  double-blind  (with  respect  to  placebo) 
study in Parkinson’s disease patients experiencing motor fluctuations (OFF periods). This study evaluated 
pharmacokinetics  of  inhaled  CVT-301  compared  with  placebo  and  a  standard  dose  of  oral 
carbidopa/levodopa  in  Parkinson’s  disease  patients  in  a  clinic  setting  established  to  simulate  an 
end-of-dose wearing-off episode.

On the morning of each in-clinic visit day, the subject took his/her usual morning (AM) levodopa dosage 
and other usual Parkinson medications prior to the visit. Upon arrival at each (in-clinic) dosing visit in a 
presumed  ON  state,  subjects  underwent  baseline  blood  sampling  for  pharmacokinetic  assessment. 
Approximately 4 to 5 hours following the AM dose, after subjects were in a full OFF state, subjects were 
to receive a dose of study medication. All subjects received open-label oral carbidopa/levodopa at the first 
dosing visit. On subsequent dosing visits, subjects received in a double-blinded manner CVT-301 25 mg 
and 50 mg FPD and placebo in the order of an assigned randomized configuration. Treatment visits were 
separated by at least 48 hours. 
Pre-dose levodopa values at start of the OFF period were highly variable and ranged from 46 ng/ml to 
2980  ng/ml.  Within  a  subject  the  variability  between  the  4  treatment  periods  was  much  smaller.  To 
correct for baseline levodopa plasma concentrations from their prior morning dose of carbidopa/levodopa 
treatment, each subject’s  post-dose  levels were  individually corrected  using  a variable decay method 
using  the  baseline  pharmacokinetic  sample  at  arrival  in  the  clinic  (ON  state)  and  the  pre-dose 
pharmacokinetic sample at start  of the OFF  state.  Figure  3  shows that  applying  the  variable  baseline 
adjustment the curves for the placebo treatment stayed very near zero throughout the sampling period 
supporting  the  variable  baseline  adjustment  method  was  an  appropriate  approach  for  accounting  for 
levodopa plasma concentrations present prior to dosing.

Figure 3 shows that plasma levodopa concentrations increased rapidly; Peak plasma levodopa exposures 
following treatment with CVT-301 50 mg FPD were generally similar to those observed in 
carbidopa-pre-treated healthy subjects. The baseline-adjusted Cmax and AUC of inhaled levodopa 
increased in a dose-proportional manner. Incremental plasma levodopa concentrations exceeding 400 
ng/mL within 10 minutes were observed in 19% (3/16), 77% (17/22), and 27% (4/15) of subjects 
following administration of CVT-301 25 mg FPD, CVT-301 50 mg FPD, and oral CD/levodopa, respectively.

The inter-subject variability in levodopa exposure was lower for orally inhaled than for oral administered 
levodopa (Table 5).

Cough was a treatment related AE for inhaled levodopa. Plasma levodopa concentrations were 42.6% and 
32.8% (25 mg and 50 mg respectively) lower in subjects who reported mild-to-moderate cough than in 
subjects without cough.  However, the Cmax concentrations achieved for those who coughed after 50 mg 
FPD were within the potentially therapeutic range.  
Special populations 
Pharmacokinetics of levodopa following inhalation was comparable in healthy subjects and in Parkinson 
patients. Smoking appeared not to affect the exposure of levodopa (Study 007). In addition, the levodopa 
exposure was comparable subjects with asthma (Study 008) although the absorption seemed somewhat 
slower (median tmax was 47 min). Because of the risk of bronchospasm, use of inhaled levodopa is not 
recommended in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other chronic 
underlying lung disease. This is reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) section 4.4.  
As systemic levodopa exposure is representative for its activity, effects of renal and hepatic impairment, 
gender, race, body-weight and age on clearance and volume of distribution are expected to be similar for 
the oral and inhalation route. Indeed, levodopa exposure was 40 to 50% higher in females compared to 
males following levodopa inhalation and oral administration. After correction for bodyweight, AUC values 
were about 15% higher in females than in males. Hence, most of the gender differences are accounted for 
by difference in body weight.  
A two-compartment popPK model including two absorption compartments and first-order elimination was 
submitted  to  characterize  both  lung  and  gastrointestinal  absorption  and  to  evaluate  if  absorption  of 
levodopa  in  the  lungs  was  dependent  on  various  intrinsic  factors.  Observations  after  oral 
levodopa/carbidopa were excluded from the popPK analysis with the exception of predose concentrations 
in Study CVT-301-002 that were included in the analysis. This was done to account for the high predose 
concentrations observed prior to CVT-301 administration. Both clearance and apparent volume of central 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 34/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
compartment  were  linearly  correlated  with  bodyweight.  Absorption  rate  constants  for  lung  and 
gastrointestinal absorption were 8.0 h−1 and 0.56 h−1, respectively. The model was adjusted to account 
for a higher ka in Study CVT-301-001. The early formulation had a higher fraction of smaller particles 0.5 
–  2.0  µm  than  the  phase  3  and  commercial  formulation,  this  could  have  resulted  in  a  faster  rise  in 
levodopa plasma concentrations in this study.  Gender, race, body weight or age,  were not significant 
factors influencing the absorption of levodopa in the lungs. 
Elderly 
Clinical studies specifically designed to analyse the effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of levodopa 
were not conducted with Inbrija. The mean age of participants in the pivotal efficacy and long-term safety 
studies was 63.3 years (range: 37 – 82 years) and 49% of the subjects were ≥65 years old 
(CVT-301-004, CVT-301-004E, and CVT-301-005). 
Pharmacokinetics interaction studies 
No in vitro and in vivo interaction studies were conducted with Inbrija. Levodopa is not a new chemical 
entity and therefore the absence of in vitro and in vivo interactions studies is acceptable.  Drug drug 
interactions  with  monoamine  oxidase  (MAO)  inhibitors  (contraindication)  and  dopamine  D2  receptor 
antagonists and isoniazid (potential reduction of effectiveness of levodopa) are known interactions for 
levodopa and have been adequately described in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
As Inbrija is administered as orally inhaled powder, Inbrija potentially could influence the lung deposition 
of  other  inhaled  medicines.  However,  as  use  of  Inbrija  is  not  recommended in  patients  with  asthma, 
COPD, or other chronic underlying lung disease co-medication of Inbrija with other orally inhaled products 
is unlikely and it has not been investigated. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
In  conclusion,  the  pharmacokinetic  data  following  levodopa  oral  inhalation  support  the  concept  that 
administration of inhaled levodopa 50 mg FPD results in a rapid increase of systemic levodopa plasma 
concentrations >400 ng/ml within 10 min of administration in Parkinson’s disease patients, taking an oral 
dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor/levodopa based regimen.    
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Parkinson’s  disease  is  characterized  by  a  loss  of  dopamine-containing  neurons  in  the  basal  ganglia. 
Levodopa, the metabolic precursor to dopamine, is readily able to cross the blood-brain barrier, where it 
is converted to dopamine in the central nervous system. Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson’s disease 
has been directed primarily at enhancing striatal dopamine replacement through oral administration of 
levodopa, which continues to be the foundation and gold standard for the symptomatic treatment of the 
disease.  
As  the  disease  progresses,  more  patients  experience  motor  complications  ranging  from  increasing 
frequency and duration of OFF periods which may be disabling. The development of OFF episodes relates 
to both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Safety,  pharmacokinetics,  and  pharmacodynamics  of  Inbrija  was  evaluated  in  phase  2  Study  002  in 
Parkinson’s patients in a clinic setting to simulate an end-of-dose wearing-off episode to select the dose 
of inhaled levodopa for the phase 3 studies.  
Study CVT-301-002 was a Phase 2a, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind (only with 
respect to inhaled treatments) study in 24 PD subjects who experienced motor fluctuations (OFF periods) 
for a minimum of 2 hours of average daily OFF time per waking day. Each subject received a single dose 
of open-label oral Sinemet 25 mg/100 mg (carbidopa/levodopa [CD/levodopa]) during the first treatment 
visit and then in a randomized, double-blind manner using a 3-way crossover design, single doses of 3 
inhaled treatments: placebo, CVT-301 25 mg  FPD  and CVT-301 50  mg  FPD  at  subsequent  treatment 
visits. Treatment visits were to be separated by at least 2 days. 
On the morning of each in-clinic visit day, the subject took his/her usual morning (AM) levodopa dosage 
and other usual PD medications prior to the visit. Upon arrival at each (in-clinic) dosing visit in a presumed 
ON state, subjects underwent baseline blood sampling for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety 
assessments. Approximately 4 to 5 hours following the AM dose, after subjects were in a full OFF state, 
subjects  were  to  receive  a  dose  of  study  medication.  Subjects  received  the  open-label  oral  dose  of 
carbidopa/levodopa  in  a  fasted  state;  during  the  double-blind  treatment  period,  the  inhaled  study 
treatments were administered in the fasted state. 
Pharmacodynamic assessments evaluated were the time to onset of meaningful ON, duration of ON state, 
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III motor section (UPDRS-III) score (arrival, pre-dose, 15, 
30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes post-dose), timed tapping test and requirement for rescue 
medication.  
Results for the response analysis of meaningful ON, the UPDRS-III and tapping efficacy endpoints are 
summarized in Table 6. Treatment with CVT-301 50 mg FPD resulted in a greater proportion of patients 
achieving a meaningful ON response, UPDRS III response, and tapping response compared to placebo. 
After taking into account the extent of the placebo effect, the percentage of responders increased with 
increasing  levodopa  dose,  regardless  of  route  of  delivery  (i.e.,  levodopa  doses  CVT-301  25  mg  FPD, 
CVT-301 50 mg FPD, and oral carbidopa/levodopa 25 mg/100 mg).

d Number of patients administered rescue medication 
e Oral CD/LD was administered as an open-label dose.  
Responses at the earlier nominal time points were observed more frequently following treatment with 
CVT-301 50 mg FDP. The median time to onset of meaningful ON was more rapid following administration 
of CVT-301 25 mg FDP and CVT-301 50 mg FDP (median [range]: 29 [4 to 97] minutes and 36 [12 to 105] 
minutes, respectively) compared to oral carbidopa/levodopa (45 [15 to 105] minutes). The onset of ON 
for placebo was 32.4 [16 to 110] minutes. The median duration of ON was longer after the administration 
of CVT-301 25 mg FDP (median [range]: 83 [38 to 280] minutes) and CVT-301 50 mg FDP (110 [4 to 268] 
minutes) compared with placebo (69 [25 to 167] minutes). The duration of ON following treatment with 
open-label oral carbidopa/levodopa was 132 (40 to 265) minutes. 
The  exposure-response  analyses  in  form  of  UPDR-III  response  at  15  minutes indicated  a  numerically 
better response  in subjects with an increase in  levodopa plasma concentrations  > 400 ng/ml  than in 
subjects with plasma concentrations < 400 ng/ml. Similarly patients with higher than median levodopa 
plasma concentrations at time of onset of the OFF period, had a numerically better response than patients 
with lower than median levodopa plasma concentrations at time of onset of the OFF period. 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  dyskinesia  was  greatest  after  the  administration  of  oral 
carbidopa/levodopa treatment (37.5%), and lower for CVT-301 25 mg FDP and CVT-301 50 mg FDP with 
17.4% and 25%, respectively. 
The  magnitude  of  the  pharmacodynamic  effects,  including  dyskinesia,  following  CVT-301  50  mg  FPD 
inhalation was less than the effects of oral levodopa (Sinemet 25 mg /100 mg) but responses were  in 
general observed somewhat earlier with CVT-301 50 mg FPD inhalation compared to oral levodopa.   
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Oral  administration  of  levodopa  is  the  gold  standard  for  the  symptomatic  treatment  of  Parkinson’s 
disease. As the disease progresses, more patients experience motor complications including increased 
frequency and duration of OFF periods, which may be disabling. The development of OFF episodes relates 
to both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors of the applied therapy. 
The levodopa dry powder inhalation formulation was  aimed  at delivering levodopa at doses on top of 
treatment with regular dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor/levodopa medication, in order to compensate for 
OFF  symptoms  due  to  low  levodopa  plasma  levels,  more  rapidly  and  less  variably  as  compared  to 
intermittent oral dosing. The proposed inhalation levodopa dose to be delivered-66 mg (corresponding to 
50 mg fine particle dose) is lower than the usual oral doses and therefore has a lower risk of inducing 
dyskinesia (at levodopa plasma levels above 800 ng/ml).  
The  pharmacokinetic  data  following  levodopa  inhalation  support  the  concept  that  administration  of 
inhaled levodopa 50 mg FPD results in the majority of subjects (77%) in a rapid increase (within 10 min) 
of systemic levodopa plasma concentrations >400 ng/ml. Inter-subject variability  following inhalation 
was less than the variability following oral levodopa administration. Gender, race, body weight or age did 
not influence the absorption of levodopa in the lungs. 
Pharmacodynamics  of  inhaled  levodopa,  compared  with  placebo,  and  a  standard  dose  of  oral 
carbidopa/levodopa  in  Parkinson’s  disease  patients  in  a  clinic  setting,  established  an  end-of-dose 
wearing-off episode in study 002. The results show that levodopa inhalation powder dose 50 mg FPD that 
potentially  could lead  to  a  clinical  meaningful  improvement  of  OFF  periods,  were  reached  faster than 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 37/87 
 
  
 
 
 
compared  to  oral  LD  administration,  although  a  wide  inter-individual  variety  was  observed.  Although 
numeric responses were evident, CVT-301 25 mg FDP was not statistically different from placebo.  In 
general, the magnitude of the pharmacodynamics effects was smaller compared to oral levodopa which 
could be due to the lower administered dose following inhalation. The data from study 002 support the 
selection of the doses 60 mg and 84 mg (corresponding to 35 mg and 50 mg FPD, respectively) for the 
phase 3 studies. 
It was hypothesised that achieving levodopa plasma concentrations > 400 ng/ml 5 to 10 min following 
levodopa  inhalation  should  be  high  enough  to  counteract  the  emergent  OFF  period.  The 
exposure-response  in form  of  UPDRS-III  response  at 15  minutes indicated a better response  with an 
increase in levodopa concentrations > 400 ng/ml upon  Inbrija treatment compared to patients with a 
levodopa  increase  <  400  ng/ml.  As  more  patients  achieved  this  increase  with  the  50  mg  FDP  dose 
compared to the 25 mg FDP dose, this is supportive of the selection of the 50 mg FDP dose of CVT-301. 
The shortened tmax following levodopa inhalation did not increase the risk of dyskinesia and is not of 
concern.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has shown that Inbrija’s levodopa plasma levels, which could lead to a clinical meaningful 
improvement of OFF periods, were reached faster following oral inhalation than compared to oral 
levodopa administration. The proposed inhalation levodopa dose to be delivered-66 mg (corresponding to 
50 mg fine particle dose) is lower than the usual oral doses and therefore has a lower risk of inducing 
dyskinesia (at levodopa plasma levels above 800 ng/ml). 
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of levodopa following inhalation have been sufficiently 
characterised at the intended dose of 50 mg FPD.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of levodopa inhalation powder for the treatment of OFF symptoms in PD patients 
experiencing motor fluctuations was assessed in 4 clinical trials (see Table 7). Studies CVT-301-003 
(referred to as study 003) and CVT-301-004 (referred to as study 004) were considered pivotal. Both 
were randomized, multicentre, double blind, placebo controlled studies in PD patients experiencing 
>2hrs/daily OFF periods. In both studies efficacy of CVT-301 60 mg and CVT-301 84 mg were compared 
to placebo. In study 004 this was at 12 weeks and for study 003 this was after 2 weeks of treatment at 
each dose levels. Study 004E and Study 005 were both long term safety studies with exploratory efficacy 
endpoints.

In  addition  to  the  above  mentioned  trials,  the  applicant  performed  an  additional  trial  (RPT-2202)  to 
demonstrate the safe, effective and usability of the system and to identify any residual use related risks.  
The trial included 27 PD patients, 15 PD care givers and 15 health care professionals. Seven PD patients 
and  8  caregivers  were  untrained.  The  study  showed  that  training  is  needed  to  become  familiar  and 
successful with the device and the application procedure; hence reference to training in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC has been included.  
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
There were no dose response studies performed, however multiple doses were assessed in study 001. 
Study CVT-301-001 was a safety and pharmacokinetic study of single ascending doses of CVT-301 in 
26 healthy subjects was conducted in 2 parts. Using a crossover design, volunteers received CVT-301 at

escalating doses ranging from 10 to 50 mg LD FPD. Part A, the dose escalation phase, was an open-label, 
3-period  crossover,  single-ascending  dose  study  of  4  CVT-301  dose  levels,  in  which  1  to  5  CVT-301 
capsules were administered sequentially to reach the target dose. Each capsule delivered an approximate 
10 mg LD FPD. FPDs of approximately 10, 20, 30, and 50 mg LD were administered, corresponding to 1, 
2, 3, and 5 sequential inhalations of CVT-301 10 mg FPD capsules, respectively.  Part B concerned the 
exposure to oral LD/CD 100mg/25mg.  
Dose-normalized data demonstrated proportionality across the four dose strengths.  When compared to 
oral LD/CD 100 mg/25 mg, inhaled CVT-301 produced a more rapid increase in plasma concentrations 
than with oral administration of LD/CD 100 mg/25 mg (See Figure 4). Potentially therapeutically-relevant 
plasma LD concentrations, i.e. 400 ng/μL, were achieved within 5 to 10 minutes after CVT-301 doses of 
20 to 50 mg FPD in healthy adults. Based on these results, the highest tested dose of 50 mg LD FPD and 
a 25 mg LD FPD dose were selected.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
2.5.2.1.  Study CVT-301-004  
Study CVT-301-004 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week, multicenter 
(North America and Europe) study of inhaled CVT-301 or placebo for the treatment of up to 5 OFF periods 
per day in PD subjects experiencing motor fluctuations (OFF periods). Each OFF period was to be treated 
with inhalation of 2 capsules of study drug (i.e., 2 capsules used in the inhaler per treated episode, to 
deliver the intended dose). Subjects were not to use study drug for the treatment of early morning OFF 
periods. The double-blind treatment period was 12 weeks.

  Study participants  
Main inclusion criteria were a PD Diagnosis, stable LD/CD medication (daily dose ≤1600 mg divided over 
3 gits), experiencing OFF ≥ 2hours daily, 30-85 years of age, modified Hoehn & Yahr stage 1-3, motor 
fluctuations, ability to discriminate OFF, ability to handle device. 
Furthermore patients should have a  ≥ 25% difference between UPDRS-III scores recorded in their ON 
and OFF states at screening and must have been able to perform a spirometry manoeuvre in the ON and 
OFF states and must have had a screening FEV1 ≥ 50% of predicted, and an FEV1/FVC ratio > 60% in the 
ON state at screening. 
Exclusion criteria were: severe dyskinesia, previous surgery for PD (or planned during study period), 
psychotic symptoms, COPD, asthma or other chronic respiratory diseases within the last 5 years, and any 
contraindication to perform routine spirometry or who were unable to perform a spirometry manoeuvre.

Abbreviations: DL1 = dose level 1 (60 mg); DL2 = dose level 2 (84 mg); DLco = carbon monoxide diffusing capacity; 
SV = Screening visit; TV = treatment visit; W = week.  
Note 1: Spirometry was performed on the same day as the DLco test.  
Note 2: The baseline DLco test was scheduled after SV2 but in order to widen the window for drug shipment, protocol 
amendment v4.0 removed the requirement to have randomization occur after this DLco test.  
  Treatment  
The study drugs, CVT-301 (active) and placebo (control), were administered by the inhalation route using 
the CVT-301 inhaler. Two CVT-301 dose levels were investigated as described in Table 8, below. 
The first dose of blinded inhaled study drug was administered in the clinic on Day 1 (Treatment Visit [TV] 
1) and the last scheduled dose was at Week 12 (Day 84 ± 5 days; TV4). In between clinic visits, subjects 
were to administer double-blind study drug at home as needed to treat up to 5 OFF periods per day, as 
close as possible to the time when they began to experience OFF symptoms. The study design is depicted 
schematically in Figure 5. 
All patients were trained on use of the inhaler utilizing the Instructions for Use (IFU) in both the ON and 
OFF states during the screening visit. All patients needed to demonstrate an ability to use the inhaler 
while in the OFF state prior to randomization. All in-clinic dosing (in OFF state) was observed by site staff.

Table 8: 
Description of study drugs 
Because  Inbrija  contains  levodopa  only  (i.e.,  with  no  DDI),  study  drug  will  be  administered  only  to 
patients taking a DDI-containing levodopa formulation (e.g., CD or benserazide).  
The 2 selected CVT-301 dose levels 60 mg and 84 mg are based on safety and PK data from Studies 
CVT-301-001 and CVT-301-006 in healthy adult volunteers, the safety, PK and pharmacodynamic data 
from Study CVT-301-002 in PD patients with motor fluctuations, and the safety and efficacy data from 
study CVT-301-003 in PD patients with motor fluctuations. 
  Outcomes /endpoints  
The primary endpoint of the study was the change in the UPDRS-III score from (same day) pre-dose to 30 
minutes post-dose following treatment (CVT-301 84 mg) of subjects experiencing an OFF period at the 
study clinic at the Week 12 visit. 
Key secondary endpoints (and also associated with the Week 12 visit) were: 
1.  proportion of subjects achieving resolution of an OFF to an ON state (Responder ON) within 60 
minutes after study drug is administered in the clinic and maintaining the ON state at 60 minutes 
after study drug administration (per the examiner's subjective assessment); 
2.  change in the UPDRS-III score from (same day) predose to 20 minutes postdose following 
treatment of subjects experiencing an OFF period at the study clinic; 
3.  proportion of subjects who improved based on the PGI-C rating scale (subjects were defined as 
"improved on the PGI-C Rating Scale" if their PGI-C rating was "much improved," "improved," or "a 
little improved"); 
4.  change in the UPDRS-IIII score from (same day) predose to 10 minutes postdose following 
treatment of subjects experiencing an OFF period at the study clinic; 
5.  change from baseline in total daily OFF time assessed by the subject and recorded in the PD Diary. 
Subjects had to take their regular oral PD medications in the morning prior to their planed clinic visit. 
Visits were between 2-5 hours post oral PD medications. The dosing time of Inbrija was to be defined 
when the subjects OFF state was recognized by both the patient and investigator, preferably between 205 
hours after their prior oral PD medication. Patients prepared and self-administered their dose of Inbrija.  
• 
Sample size  
The sample size determination (calculation performed using nQuery Advisor, Version 7.0) was based on 
the primary endpoint. The study was powered to detect a difference of 5 points in the mean change in the 
average UPDRS-III score, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 10.0 points. To achieve a power of 90%, 
a total of 86 patients per group was required using a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. To account for a 
dropout rate of approximately 25%, 115 patients per group were randomly assigned to treatment. If the 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 42/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
withdrawal rate exceeded 25%, additional patients could be enrolled to ensure that at least 258 patients 
completed the study. 
• 
Randomization  
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive CVT-301 60 mg, CVT-301 84 mg, or placebo 
using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). Randomization was stratified by Hoehn & Yahr state 
(<2.5 vs ≥2.5) and by spirometry variables i.e. FEV1 <60% of predicted or FEV1/FVC ratio <70% versus 
FEV1≥60% of predicted or FEV1/FVC ratio≥70%).  
• 
Blinding  
In  order  to  maintain  blinding  of  administered  study  drug,  capsules  for  each  of  the  3  possible  study 
treatments were identical in appearance, and packaging was labelled in a manner that did not reveal 
which treatment the capsules contained.  
• 
Statistical methods  
Analysis sets 
  All available population (AAP): Patients who consented to the study, including screen failures. The 
AAP was used in patient listings and the summary of patient disposition. 
•  Safety  population:  Patients  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  inhaled  CVT-301  or  placebo.  The 
safety population was used in all safety analyses. 
• 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: Patients who were randomly assigned to inhaled CVT-301 or 
placebo and received at least one dose of study drug. The ITT population was used in all efficacy 
analyses and summaries of patient demographic and baseline characteristics. 
•  Completer population: A subset of the ITT population that included patients with a UPDRS-III 
score at week 12. The completer population was used in the sensitivity analysis of the primary 
endpoint.

Figure 6: schematic representation of the hierarchical testing approach 
In order to maintain an overall alpha-level of 0.05 and claim statistical significance on selected efficacy 
variables for both doses of CVT-301 versus placebo, a fixed-sequence hierarchy was pre-specified. First, 
CVT-301 84 mg and placebo were compared on the primary endpoint and the 5 key secondary endpoints 
presented in the order above (Figure 6: schematic representation of the hierarchical testing 
approachFigure 6). Next, CVT-301 60 mg and placebo were compared in the same order with the same 
hierarchical rules as applied for CVT-301 84 mg and placebo comparisons. According to the hierarchical 
rules, formal testing for statistical significance could proceed until a nonsignificant result was obtained 
(i.e., a nominal p-value greater than 0.05). 
The changes in the UPDRS-III from predose to the each postdose time point (10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes) 
and the changes from baseline in Hauser Diary OFF Time were analysed using a mixed model for repeated 
measurements (MMRM). Missing data were implicitly handled by the MMRM analysis with the underlying 
assumption that the missing data were missing at random. Categorical endpoints (responder ON and 
PGI-C) were analysed at a particular double-blind visit via the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test. In the case 
of missing categorical data for a nonmissed visit, the outcome was imputed to be a nonresponder.

Results 
There were 339 randomized patients who took at least 1 dose of study medication: 112 patients were 
randomized to placebo, 113 patients to CVT-301 60 mg, and 114 patients to CVT-301 84 mg. All efficacy 
(ITT  Population)  and  safety  analyses  (Safety  Population)  are  based  on  these  patients.  Among  the 
339 patients included in the efficacy and safety analyses, 290 patients (85.5%) completed the study.

Conduct of study 
Overall, there were 297 (84.6%) patients with  at least 1 protocol deviation. Of the patients who  had 
deviations, 43 (12.3%) had major protocol deviations, with most occurring in the CVT-301 84mg group, 
22 (18.3%). No patients were excluded from the ITT analyses due to a protocol deviation. 
• 
Baseline data 
Baseline characteristics were generally similar among treatment groups (see Table 9). 
The median age was 65 years.  Most study participants were White. The majority of participants were 
treated in the USA (73.2%) followed by Poland (19.5%). Males made up over 70% of study participants. 
The majority of patients (212 patients, 62.5%) reported no smoking history, 119 (35.1%) patients were 
former smokers, and 8 (2.4%) patients were current smokers.

Outcome and estimation  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the UPDRS-III score from (same day) predose to 30 
minutes postdose at Week 12 based on the CVT-301 84 mg versus placebo comparison (Step 1 of the 
hierarchical testing order). Reductions in UPDRS-III scores are indicative of improvement.  
The LS mean (SE) change from predose in UPDRS-III score at 30 minutes postdose at 12 weeks was -5.91 
(1.500) for the placebo group and -9.83 (1.506) for the CVT-301 84mg group. The LS mean difference 
between CVT-301 84mg and placebo was -3.92, which was statistically significant (p = 0.009).  
As  the  change  in  UPDRS-III  from  predose  to  30  minutes  was  statistically  significantly  different  for 
CVT-301 84mg compared to placebo (p = 0.009), formal statistical testing of the treatment comparisons 
proceeded to the next endpoint. The percentage of ON responders within (and maintained at) 60 minutes 
at Week 12 was also statistically significant (p = 0.003) for CVT-301 84 compared to placebo.  
The hierarchical sequence failed to reach statistical significance for change from predose in UPDRS-III at 
20 minutes (p = 0.062) in the CVT-301 84 mg treatment arm (see Figure 8). While subsequent steps in 
the hierarchy are technically ineligible for being declared statistically significant, nominal p-values < 0.05 
were observed for PGI-C (p < 0.001) (see Figure 9) and change from predose in UPDRS-III at 10 minutes 
(p = 0.046) (Figure 8).  
Key secondary endpoints: 
The change in UPDRS-III score from predose was assessed at 10-60minutes postdose and is graphically 
presented in the Figure 8 below. The trend in change of UPDRS-III score 30 post dose is similar for all 
groups, i.e. CVT-301 60 gm, CVT-301 84 mg and placebo. There is an initial improvement observed after 
10 minutes, this continuous to improve for an additional 10-20minutes and an improvement from 
baseline is maintained for up to 60 minutes post dose. The improvement in UPDRS-III from baseline is 
statistically significant different from placebo CVT-301 84 mg dose at t=10min, t=30min and t-60min. For 
CVT-301 60 mg the differences from placebo were significant fore t=30min and t=60min.

Population) 
Abbreviations: ITT = intent-to-treat; UPDRS = Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. 
The daily OFF time at week 12 was 4.92, 4.92 and 5.59 hours for CVT-301 60mg, CVT-301 84mg and 
placebo,  respectively.  The  difference  from  placebo  in  daily  OFF  was  -0.10  hr  (95%  CI  -0.66;  0.46, 
p=0.722) for the CVT-301 60mg and -0.01hr (95% CI -0.55; 0.56, p=0.978) for the 84mg treatment 
group.  
The responders ON, was 55.6% for the 60mg and 57.7% for the 84mg dose group and 36.1% for placebo. 
This difference from placebo was statistically significant for the 84mg dose (p=0.006), but not for the 
60mg dose, due to the hierarchical analysis (p=0.003).  
The  PGI-C  score  for  the  proportion  of  subjects  that  perceived  any  improvement,  i.e.  including  little 
improved,  improved  and  much  improved,  is  presented  in  Figure  9,  below.  The  proportion  of  any 
improvement was 71.4 % for CVT-301 84 mg, 61.6% for CVT-301 60 mg and 46.4% for the placebo arm. 
Both CVT-301 treatment arms were significantly different from placebo (p= 0.026 for 60mg dose and 
p<0.001 for the 84mg dose).

During  the  course  of  the  trial  subjects  administered  an  average  approximately  2  doses  per  day.  The 
proportion of days with >5 doses, 5 doses, 4 doses, 3 doses, 2 doses, 1 dose and 0 doses per day were 
0.17%,  1.87%,  7.57%,  16.86%,  24.44%,  29.12%,  19.98%,  respectively.    This  was  not  different  for 
placebo and the two treatment arms, i.e. CVT-301 60 mg and CVT-301 84 mg.  
  Ancillary analysis 
Sensitivity Analysis for UPDRS-III  
The results from each of the model based sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were very 
similar to that from the primary analysis (i.e., statistically significant results for MMRM ANCOVA model 
based on overall ITT population), with the exception of the analysis with the addition of region by 
treatment interaction in the model, which resulted in p-values that were not statistically significant 
(p=0.094 for CVT-301 84 mg).

Subgroup Analysis for UPDRS-III  
The improvement of UPDRS-III score 30 min post dose at week 12 were comparable across, age, gender, 
PD severity, (Hoehn & Yahr stage), dyskinesia, Daily Levodopa dose, mean daily OFF time and screening 
spirometry. A notable trend of a slight better improvement was generally observed in more severe PD 
population characteristics.  
In terms of PD severity, PD patients apparently benefitted from CVT-301 84 mg as an adjunctive 
treatment irrespective of baseline PD severity (defined by Hoehn & Yahr Scale), with the treatment 
benefit as per UPDRS-III score being more pronounced in patients with more severe baseline PD (Figure 
10).

Forest Plot of Change from Predose in UPDRS-III Score at 30 Minutes Postdose at Week 
12 by Subgroups CVT-301 84 mg versus placebo (Study CVT-301-004 ITT Population) 
The  applicant  performed  a  comparative  analysis  of  the  efficacy  observed  in  the  North  America  study 
centres compared to the EU study centres. The baseline values where different between the two groups, 
however, the effect sizes were comparable for all outcomes between both regions. 
2.5.2.2.  Study CVT-301-003 
This study was a Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter (North America and 
Europe) study of inhaled CVT-301 or placebo for the treatment of up to 3 OFF episodes per day in PD 
subjects  experiencing  motor  fluctuations.  Patients  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  either 
placebo or CVT-301. 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 50/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study had a screening period (7-35 days) a double bind treatment period (2 weeks at 60mg) and 
followed by a 2 weeks 84mg treatment.  
Methods 
  Study Participants 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to the population in study CVT-301-004. 
The main inclusion criteria were PD diagnoses ,  modified Hoehn & Yahr stage 1-3, OFF ≥ 2hours daily, 
recognise  “wearing  off”  symptoms,  not  smoking  during  the  entire  clinic  visit  days,  have  a    ≥  25% 
difference between UPDRS-III scores recorded in their ON and OFF states at screening and must have 
been able to perform a spirometry manoeuvre in the ON and OFF states and must have had a screening 
FEV1 ≥ 50% of predicted, and an FEV1/FVC ratio > 60% in the ON state at screening. 
Exclusion criteria were: severe dyskinesia,  previous  surgery for PD (or planned during study period), 
psychotic symptoms, COPD, asthma or other chronic respiratory disease, contraindication to the use of 
levodopa,  were  diagnosed  with  caffeine/nicotine  related  disorder  (DSM-IV),  had  been  treated  with 
investigational drugs within the last 4 weeks.  
  Treatment 
The treatment period included 4 separate in-clinic visits over a 4-week period. The first dose of blinded 
study drug at 60mg was given in the clinic at week 1 (i.e., 2 capsule inhalations of either CVT-301 or 
placebo). The first dose of blinded study drug at 84 mg was given in the clinic at 3 weeks (i.e., 3 capsule 
inhalations of either CVT-301 or placebo). For the duration of the study, each subject’s background PD 
medication regimen was to remain unchanged.  
The study design is depicted schematically in Figure 11.

  Outcomes/endpoints 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 51/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint was the change in UPDRS-III motor score at 10-60 minutes post-dose at week 4 
assessed in a similar clinical setting as study CVT-301-004.  
Key secondary endpoints were examiner rated time to ON, responder ON, PGI-C, daily OFF and ON time 
assessed after 2 weeks use of CVT-301 84 mg and 2 weeks use of CVT-301 60 mg.  
  Statistical methods  
The primary endpoint was the mean change from predose in average UPDRS-III score averaged over 10, 
20, 30 and 60 minutes following treatment of an OFF episode at Visit 6 (i.e., Week 4 of the treatment 
period). The primary endpoint was analysed using a MMRM. Missing data were implicitly handled by the 
MMRM analysis with the underlying assumption that the missing data were missing at random.  
Results  
The disposition of subjects is shown in Figure 12. Of the 45 screen failures, 15 (11% of those screened) 
were due to subjects either not being able to perform spirometry or not meeting spirometry eligibility 
criteria. Four screen failure subjects were unable to perform the spirometry manoeuvre; 11 subjects were 
excluded due to failure to achieve a FEV1 or FEV1/FVC ratio value that met eligibility criteria at screening. 
There were 115 protocol deviations overall. Of those, 36 were major protocol deviations and the majority 
were deemed to have no impact on efficacy assessments.

Table  11  presents  a  summary  of  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  for  the  ITT  population.  
Baseline demographics and outcomes measured were comparable between treatment arms and in line 
with the findings reported in Study CVT-301-004.  The mean age for the overall ITT population was 62.4 
years, and they were mostly white (96.5%) and non-Hispanic (94.2%). Approximately 66% of the overall 
study population was male, and slight gender imbalances existed in the CVT-301 group (25 [58.1%] male) 
and in the placebo group (32 [74.4%] male). Most (74.4%) of the study population was from the United 
States; 25.6% were from Europe. Most subjects (67.4%) reported that they had never smoked. Smoking 
history and mean MMSE scores at screening were generally similar between treatment groups.

Note: Baseline average daily levodopa dose calculated from ‘Baseline PD Treatment’. 
Note: Subjects 1004-007 and 4003-005, although not appearing in the database due to site error, were reviewed and 
found to be eligible for the study based on UPDRS score at screening, and were included in the analysis. 
a Percentage was calculated as OFF-ON/OFF * 100%. 
b  Minimum  UPDRS  ON  to  OFF  difference  was  25%  for  all  enrolled  subjects,  as  per  protocol.  Subjects  had  the 
opportunity to repeat UPDRS assessments if this difference was not achieved in the first screening visit; however, some 
of the incorrect UPDRS screening values were included in the database accidentally. The error was not noticed until 
after database lock and was therefore unable to be changed. Documentation of all correct UPDRS screening values that 
show 25% or greater difference are available for all subjects.  
  Outcome and estimation  
Efficacy data were analysed by treatment group and study visit. As depicted schematically in Figure 11, 
the double-blind treatment period was 4 weeks in duration, included 4 separate in-clinic visits (Visits 3, 4, 
5 and 6) and evaluated 2 dose levels of CVT-301 (60 mg and 84 mg). For clarity, study visits are used as 
follows to indicate the time point of interest: 
Visit 4: Week 1 of the double-blind treatment period; following 1 week of CVT-301 60 mg exposure; 
Visit 5: Week 2 of the double-blind treatment period; following the first administration of CVT-301 84 mg; 
Visit 6: Week 4 of the double-blind treatment period; following 2 weeks of CVT-301 84 mg exposure. 
Figure 13 presents the primary efficacy analysis of UPDRS-III score mean change from predose at 10 to 
60 minutes postdose at Visit 6 (CVT-301 50 mg levodopa FPD vs placebo) for the ITT population. The 
difference  in  LS  mean  (SE)  between  the  CVT-301  response  (-10.02  [1.5])  and  the  placebo  response 
(-3.07 [1.54]) was statistically significant (p < 0.001).

The difference in UPDRS-III score from placebo was -6.95 (95% CI -10.31, -3.60) and was statistically 
significant  (p  <  0.001).  A  similar  change  from  pre-dose  values  was  observed  also  for  CVT-301 
60mg-treated subjects at week 2; i.e. the absolute change from pre-dose was -9.90 for 60 mg and -5.30 
for placebo. The difference from placebo was -4.6 (95% CI -7.9,-1.3) and significant (p=0.007).  
A dose-ordered reduction from pre-treatment values in daily OFF time was observed (mean [SE]) for 
CVT-301 60mg at Week 2 (-1.1 [0.4] hr) and CVT-301 84mg at Week 4 (-1.6 [0.4] hr). The difference 
from placebo was statistically significant only for CVT-301 84mg at Week 4 (-0.9hr (95% CI -1.73, -0.02; 
p=0.045)).   
Subjects recorded using CVT-301 at home an average of 2 times per day.  The mean proportion of days 
with 0 dose, 1 dose, 2 dose and 3 dose per day was 13%, 25%, 31% and 28% in the CVT-301 treatment 
group,  respectively.  The  dose  frequency  was  slightly  higher  in  the  placebo  group  where  the  mean 
proportion of days with 0, 1, 2 and 3 doses administered was 10%, 26%, 26% and 36%, respectively.   
In study CVT-301-003 where subjects switched from the 60 mg dose to a 84 mg dose, the results were 
consistent  with  the  findings  observed  in  the  fixed  dose  12  week  study  CVT-301-004.    The  observed 
improvement in UPDRS-III score from baseline increased when switching from the 60 mg to the 84 mg.

Analysis description  The outcomes were assessed in an artificial setting and could therefore be higher 
than the true value. 
2.5.2.4.  Clinical studies in special populations 
Elderly 
In line with PD epidemiology, the mean age of PD patients in the Phase 3 studies was 63.3 years (range; 
37 to 82 years) and 49% of the subjects were ≥ 65 years old (Studies CVT-301-004, CVT-301-004E, 
CVT-301-005). These studies indicate that no dose adjustments of Inbrija is required for elderly patients, 
and therefore no specifically designed studies of age on pharmacokinetics of LD were conducted with 
Inbrija, and this is acceptable. As there is only limited data available in very elderly patients (≥75 years) 
Inbrija’s use in this population will be monitored in the PSURs. 
Smokers and Asthma 
Due to the nature of the administration of LD, i.e. inhalation, the applicant performed separate studies to 
assess the pharmacokinetics in smokers (CVT-301-007) and asthmatic subjects (CVT-301-008). 
A clinical study (Study CVT-301-007) was performed with Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) 
administered to 56 healthy subjects (31 non-smokers and 25 smokers). After administration of Inbrija 
the Cmax and AUC0-24 h for smokers was 11% to 12% higher for smokers than for non-smokers. No dose 
adjustment is required based on smoking status. 
Study CVT-301-008 was a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study to evaluate the 
safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple administrations of CVT-301 84 mg LD doses in 24 adult subjects 
with asthma. Subjects received a total of 3 doses of CVT-301 or placebo per dosing period at intervals of 
approximately 4 hours. There was no active drug comparator arm in this study; however, the mean Cmax 
and  AUC0-4 h  were  similar  to  the  results  of  the  bridging  pharmacokinetic  study  performed  in  healthy 
subjects.  Overall, the pharmacokinetics of LD after CVT-301 was similar between asthmatic subjects and 
subjects in other CVT-301 pharmacokinetic studies.  
2.5.2.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
A pooled analysis was conducted for study CVT-301-003 and study CVT-301-004 which shared several 
similarities that facilitated pooling of the data. The improvement in UPDRS-III score, responders ON and 
PGI-C was analysed at week 4. Statistically significant difference between CVT-301 84 mg and placebo 
were  observed  10 minutes  post-dose  (p = 0.014),  and  through  60 minutes  post-dose  (p < 0.001).  A 
statistically  significant  greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  CVT-301  84mg  group  (64.2%)  were 
considered responders compared with the placebo group (35.3%) at Week 4 (p < 0.001). This was also 
reflected by the PGI-C score which showed an improvement perceived in a significant greater proportion 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019

of  subjects  in  CVT-301  84mg  group  (64.8%)  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (47.6%)  at  week  4 
(p=0.008). The change from baseline in daily OFF time after 4 weeks was -0.79 hours for CVT-301 and 
-0.34hrs for placebo (p=0.051). 
Post-hoc subgroup analysis in more severe PD patients defined as patients who used CVT-301 ≥ 3 times 
in study CVT-301-004, show numerically greater reduction in OFF time for CVT-301 compared to placebo. 
At 4 weeks, patients taking ≥ 3 doses, the change from baseline in total daily OFF time was -0.71hrs in 
CVT-301 and  -0.20hrs for placebo.  At 12 weeks  the reduction in  daily OFF  time was  -0.50hrs in the 
placebo group and -0.66hrs in the CVT-301 group.   
Similar  results  were  obtained  for  subgroup  analysis  of  study  CVT-301-004  where  the  severity  of  PD 
patients  was  defined  as  ≥  3  OFF  episodes  at  baseline.  At  4  weeks,  a  reduction  of  daily  OFF  time  of      
-0.36hrs was observed for the CVT-301 group and an increase of 0.099hrs for the placebo group. At 12 
weeks  a  reduction  of  total  daily  OFF-time  was  observed  for  both  groups,  however,  the  decrease  was 
numerically greater for the CVT-301 treatment group (-0.25hrs) compared to the placebo (-0.14hrs).   
2.5.2.6.  Supportive studies 
The  supportive  studies  concerned  the  long-term  extension  study,  CVT-301-004E,  and  the  open-label 
randomized trial, CVT-301-005. 
Study CVT-301-004E was primarily a rollover, long-term extension study to Study CVT-301-004. The 
study  duration  was  up  to  52  weeks.  The  placebo  group  was  randomized  to  either  CVT-301  60mg  or 
CVT-301 84mg.  In total 312 patients were dosed. Patients in both  CVT-301 dose  groups showed an 
improvement  in  proportion  ON  responders  (between  63%  and  66%  for  CVT-301  84  mg),  PGI-C 
(approximately 60-92% for both doses) and a reduction in daily OFF time (approximately -0.3hr up to 
-0.84hr for both doses). 
Study CVT-301-005 was a 12-month, open-label, randomized, multicenter (North America, Europe and 
Israel) study investigating the safety and effects of CVT-301 84 mg for the treatment of up to 5 OFF 
periods per day in PD patients. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the CVT-301 84 mg or the 
observational cohort, where they received the standard of care treatment. The duration was 12 months. 
At study completion, 271 patients were randomized to the CVT-301 treatment group and dosed, and 127 
patients were randomized to the observational cohort. Patients receiving CVT-301 84 mg demonstrated 
improvement on the UPDRS-III change from predose at 30 minutes postdose, proportions of patients 
achieving an ON state within 60 minutes and maintaining the ON at 60 minutes, and the PGI-C, which 
were maintained throughout the 52-week treatment period. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints were assessed in long term safety studies CVT-301-004E and 
CVT-301-005. These showed consistent results over a 52-week treatment duration. A proportion of 
responder ON (worst case input) of 65% and 85% was reported for study CVT-301-004E and 
CVT-301-005, respectively. This was reflected by the PGI-C proportion improvers of 61% in 
CVT-301-004E and 77% CVT-301-005. The reduction of OFF time was -0.84hr [95%CI -1.38, -0.30] for 
study 004 and -1.36hr [95%CI -1.80, -0.92] for study 005.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In  support  of  the  claimed  indication,  the  applicant  submitted  two  phase  3  studies,  CVT-301-004  and 
CVT-301-003  which  are  both  considered  pivotal.  Studies  CVT-301-002,  CVT-301-004E  and  study 
CVT-301-005 are considered supportive.   
The pivotal and supportive studies were designed in agreement with the Guideline on clinical investigation 
of medicinal products in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (EMA/CHMP.330418/2012 rev.2).  
Study CVT-301-004 was a 12 weeks, randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 
evaluating the efficacy of  Inbrija in PD patients with OFF periods. Subjects were 1:1:1 randomized to 
placebo, CVT-301 60mg and CVT-301 84 mg. The selected population is acceptable. Patients included in 
the trial had to be able to use the device and had the ability to recognise ON and OFF. This is reflected in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
The primary endpoint was a change in UPDRS-III at 30 minutes post-dose compared to pre-dose OFF 
motor. The UPDRS part III is designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings (e.g. tremor, 
rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability) in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Main secondary endpoints 
were  the  responder  ON,  PGI-C  and  total  daily  OFF  time  at  week  12.  The  sample  size  calculation, 
randomization and blinding are considered acceptable.  
This study confirmed the clinical efficacy of Inbrija 84 mg in the treatment of symptoms of OFF periods 
experienced by patients with PD. Inbrija 84 mg demonstrated statistically superior reduction of the 
UPDRS-III score at 30 minutes postdose in a clinical setting. The clinical relevance of this effect is 
supported by the statistically superior results in Responder ON within 60 minutes at Week 12, as well as 
the self-reported improvements on the PGI-C rating scale at Week 12 compared with placebo. CVT-301 
60 mg treatment showed nominal p-values less than 0.05 for UPDRS-III at 30 minutes postdose, percent 
responder ON, and improvement in PGI-C. Both investigator-assessed efficacy endpoints (UPDRS-III and 
ON response within 60 minutes) and a patient-reported assessment (PGI-C) showed numerically better 
results for CVT-301 84 mg compared with CVT-301 60 mg. The consistent numerical trend suggests 
potentially better efficacy of CVT-301 84 mg compared to CVT-301 60 mg. With regard to change of PD 
Diary OFF time, in contrast to the clinical Phase 2b Study CVT-301-003, no significant difference versus 
placebo could be noted. This contrasts also to the outcomes of the completed long-term safety Study 
CVT-301-005 and to the interim outcomes of the safety extension Study CVT-301-004E, showing 
patient-assessed improvements in terms of OFF periods.  
Study  CVT-301-003 was a 4 week, randomized, multicentre, placebo-controlled study, assessing the 
efficacy of Inbrija in PD patients. Subjects were similar to the population in study CVT-301-004.  The 
primary  endpoint  was  the  change  in  UPDRS-III  motor  score  at  10-60  minutes  post-dose  at  week  4 
assessed  in  a  similar  clinical  setting  as  study  CVT-301-004.  Key  secondary  endpoints  were  examiner 
rated time to ON, responder ON, PGI-C, daily OFF and ON time assessed after 2 weeks use of CVT-301 84 
mg and 2 weeks use of CVT-301 60mg.    
The statistical methods used in the studies were acceptable. Sensitivity analyses assuming missing not at 
random were requested for the primary endpoint in study CVT-301-003 and for the secondary endpoint 
daily  OFF  time.  These  analyses  were  presented  and  the  results  were  not  influenced  by  the  choice  of 
missing data handling.   
In study CVT-301-003, where subjects switched from the 60 mg dose to a 84 mg dose, the results were 
consistent with the findings observed in the fixed dose 12 week study CVT-301-004.  The observed 
improvement in UPDRS-III score from baseline increased when switching from the 60mg to the 84 mg 
dose.  
A pooled analysis was conducted for study CVT-301-003 and study CVT-301-004. The improvement in 
UPDRS-III score, responders ON and PGI-C was analysed at week 4. Statistically significant difference 
between CVT-301 84 mg and placebo were observed 10 minutes post-dose (p = 0.014), and through 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 62/87 
 
  
 
 
 
60 minutes post-dose (p < 0.001). A statistically significant greater proportion of subjects in the CVT-301 
84 mg group (64.2%) were considered responders compared with the placebo group (35.3%) at Week 4 
(p < 0.001). This was also reflected by the PGI-C score which showed an improvement perceived in a 
significant greater proportion of subjects in the Inbrija 84 mg group (64.8%) compared to the placebo 
group (47.6%) at week 4 (p=0.008).  
Long-term safety studies with exploratory efficacy endpoints (Studies CVT-301-004E, CVT-301-005) 
showed consistent results over a 52-week treatment duration (UPDRS-III, responder ON within 60 
minutes, PGI-C, reduction of OFF time [without troublesome dyskinesia]), demonstrating persistence of 
effects and supporting efficacy conclusions from Study CVT-301-004. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data were collected in PD subjects who experienced motor fluctuations (OFF periods) in the Phase 
2a Study CVT-301-002, the Phase 2b Study CVT-301-003 and the three Phase 3 studies, Study 
CVT-301-004, Study CVT-301-004E and Study CVT-301-005. Study CVT-301-009, a Phase 1 safety 
study in PD subjects with early morning OFF symptoms, also contained some efficacy measures.  
The available data showed an improvement of motor symptoms within 30 minutes when Inbrija is given 
on top of background oral LD/DC during an OFF period. This motor improvement is considered clinically 
relevant and beneficial, as it is also reflected by the PGI-C score in subjects in the treatment arms. The 
external validity of the results is accepted based on the demonstrated effects on: 1) Responders ON which 
is independently but subjectively assessed from UPDRS-III, 2) patient-reported clinical improvement, 
registered on PGI-C, and 3) the greater OFF time reduction >3 points on the UPDRS-III in more severe 
patients.  
Overall, the clinical experience in this development program supports the clinical efficacy of Inbrija in the 
treatment of symptoms of OFF periods in PD patients with motor fluctuations. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile of Inbrija was evaluated by describing the overall exposure to Inbrija, placebo, and 
observation on standard regimen: adverse events (AEs) including incidence, severity, and seriousness; 
acute and chronic pulmonary safety parameters; and laboratory parameters, vital signs and 
electrocardiograms (ECGs). Since Inbrija is delivered by the pulmonary route, pulmonary safety was 
specifically assessed by spirometry, a standard test of pulmonary function, and carbon monoxide 
diffusing capacity (DLco), a measure of gas exchange in the lung. Spirometry assessments followed the 
guideline specified by the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), while 
DLco was acquired in accordance with the American Thoracic Society criteria. Acute pulmonary safety was 
assessed by spirometry during the 60 minutes following the first dose of CVT-301, while chronic 
pulmonary safety was assessed by both spirometry and DLco at regular intervals for up to 15 months of 
exposure (subjects completing both Studies CVT-301-004 and CVT-301-004E).

Patient exposure 
The overall exposure as of the most recent database snapshot date comprised a total of 1103 subjects 
enrolled in the Inbrija clinical development program of 11 clinical studies, including 951 PD patients. A 
total of 897 subjects received at least 1 dose of Inbrija across all studies, including 754 PD patients.

b.n = number of days, % = percentage of all study days.  
Note:  POOL  1  includes  studies  CVT-301-003  and  CVT-301-004.  POOL  2  includes  CVT-301  groups  from  studies 
CVT-301-004E  and  CVT-301-005.  POOL  3  includes  CVT-301  groups  from  all  studies  (CVT-301-003,  CVT-301-004, 
CVT-301-004E and CVT-301-005). Pool 3 combines exposure from Pool 1 and Pool 2 for unique subjects and tallies the 
cumulative exposure. Therefore, the number of subjects exposed to CVT-301 for durations of ≥ 6 months is greater in 
Pool 3 than in Pool 2 due to the longer exposure for subjects who enrolled in multiple studies.  
For Observational Cohort exposure is counted as time from start of study to end of study instead of not applicable 
treatment duration.  
Abbreviation: SD = standard deviation.  
Adverse events 
Adverse events were analysed for the placebo controlled short term studies (Pool1), the long term studies 
(Pool 2) and the overall exposed population (Pool 3). An observational cohort was also included from a 
randomized trial, where subjects were randomized to either Inbrija treatment or SOC. Data was collected 
from the observational cohort for the full duration of the study, i.e. 12 months.

AEs  occurring  during  the  first  clinic  visit  day  were  assessed  to  look  for  acute  tolerability  and  for  AEs 
potentially suggesting abuse liability; Among all Inbrija-treated subjects (Pool 3), 116/705 (16.2%) had 
AEs on the clinic visit day (first dose day). Cough and throat irritation were reported for 62 (8.8%) and 17 
(2.4%),  respectively,  of  Inbrija-treated  subjects.  No  placebo  subjects  or  observational  subjects 
experienced cough or throat irritation on the first dose day. Reports of orthostatic hypotension on the first 
dose day were rare, reported for 2 Inbrija-treated subjects and 1 observational subject. 
In the placebo-controlled studies (Pool 1), the most commonly reported treatment-related AEs (i.e. those 
occurring at a frequency of 2% or greater) for subjects treated with  Inbrija and placebo, respectively, 
were cough (37 [13.7%] versus 3 [1.9%]), dyskinesia (10 [3.7%] versus 1 [0.6%]), upper respiratory 
tract infection (9 [3.3%] versus 3 [1.9%]), throat irritation (9 [3.3%] versus 1 [0.6%]), and nausea (9 
[3.3%]  versus  3  [1.9%]).  Dizziness  was  reported  for  fewer  Inbrija-treated  subjects  compared  with 
placebo subjects (2.2% versus 4.5 % respectively). 
In the long-term studies, the most commonly reported AE for subjects treated with CVT-301 (Pool 2) was 
cough  (80  [13.7%]),  followed  by  fall  (56  [9.6%]),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (32  [5.5%]), 
dyskinesia (32 [5.5%]), nasopharyngitis (29 [5.0%]), back pain (22 [3.8%]), and throat irritation (20 
[3.4%])  (Table  16).  Common  AEs  reported  more  frequently  for  the  CVT-301  group  (Pool  2)  than  for 
observational cohort, respectively, included cough (80 [13.7%] versus 1 [0.8%]), fall (56 [9.6%] versus 
7 [5.5%]), dyskinesia (32 [5.5%] versus 5 [3.9%]), upper respiratory tract infection (32 [5.5%] versus 
3 [2.4%]), and throat irritation (20 [3.4%] versus 0%).  
Among all Inbrija-treated subjects (Pool 3) who had TEAEs of cough, for most subjects the cough started 
within the first 30 days of treatment (83 [75.5%] of 110 subjects reporting cough). Most subjects with 
coughs reported coughs of mild severity (77 of 110 subjects [70%]) or moderate severity (25 of 110 
subjects [22.7%])). Eight (7.3%) of the 110 subjects with cough reported a severe cough. Overall, 13 
(1.8%) subjects withdrew from a study due to an AE of cough in Pool 3.  
Serious adverse event and deaths 
Serious adverse events 
Among all Inbrija-treated subjects (Pool 3), 129 SAEs were reported for 83 (11.8%) subjects.  
In the placebo-controlled studies (Pool 1), SAEs were reported for 8/270 (3.0%) Inbrija-treated patients 
and 4/155 (2.6%) placebo-treated patients. In the long-term studies (Pool 2), the frequency of SAEs was 
also similar between Inbrija-treated patients and the observational cohort (76/583 [13.0%] and 13/127 
[10.2%], respectively. 
Serious Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class are presented in Table 16.  
Among all subjects treated with CVT-301 (Pool 3), SAEs reported for more than 1 subject included 
osteoarthritis (6 subjects), urinary tract infection (5 subjects), atrial fibrillation (5 subjects) and 
intervertebral disc protrusion (4 subjects), chest pain, inguinal hernia, femoral neck fracture, Parkinson’s 
disease, hip fracture, dehydration (3 subjects each), and back pain, dyspnoea, intestinal obstruction, 
ischaemic stroke, syncope, radius fracture, angina pectoris and suicidal ideation (2 subjects each).

SAEs were reported more commonly in patients who received ≥ 5 doses of Inbrija per day at least once 
than for patients who received < 5 doses per day (15.6% versus 8.6%, respectively). 
Deaths 
Two  fatal  AEs  were  reported  in  clinical  studies  of  Inbrija.  One  subject  in  Study CVT-301-004  died  of 
completed  suicide,  and  1  subject  in  Study  CVT-301-005  died  of  hypoxic-ischaemic  encephalopathy 
subsequent to drowning. Both deaths were considered by the investigators to be definitely not related to 
study treatment.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events related to fractures, hypotension, dyskinesia, abuse and pulmonary safety are considered 
of special interests and are discussed below.  
Pulmonary Safety  
Acute pulmonary safety was assessed by measuring the change from predose to postdose in spirometry 
parameters at 15, 30 and 60 minutes postdose at the first clinic visit (Neurology office). There were no 
notable mean changes from predose in FEV1 (L), FEV1 percent predicted, FVC (L), or FEV1/FVC ratio at any 
postdose time point for any of the analysis groups at the first dose.

Chronic pulmonary safety was assessed by the change from baseline in FEV1 (L), FEV1 percent predicted, 
FVC (L), FEV1/FVC ratio and DLco (Hg-adjusted) reported from the pulmonary function laboratory. The 
overall mean percent change from baseline for FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC were similar across analysis 
groups.  The  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  FEV1  (L),  FEV1  percent  predicted,  FVC  (L),  and  DLco 
(Hg-adjusted)  decreased  by  small  percentages  over  the  course  of  treatment  up  to  15 months  in  all 
treatment groups including placebo and the observational cohort, and the magnitude of these changes 
were similar between CVT-treatment and placebo/observational control (see Figure 14).

from Pulmonary Function Laboratory; Safety Population) 
Abbreviations: DLco = carbon monoxide diffusing capacity; Obs = observational; SD = standard deviation.

The mean changes from baseline in FEV1/FEV1 increased for CVT-301 for exposures ≥ 6 months while the 
observational cohort declined during the same time (see Figure 15).

Assessments  of  acute  and  chronic  pulmonary  safety  concluded  no  notable  difference  between  Inbrija 
treatment compared to either placebo treatment or observational cohort in spirometry parameters and 
DLco. Additionally, post hoc subgroup analyses in Pool 2 showed no differential effects on FEV1 percent 
predicted between subjects with lower pulmonary function compared to subjects with normal pulmonary 
function, and between subjects taking a lower average daily dose of Inbrija compared to subjects taking 
a  higher  average  daily  dose.  These  results  suggest  that  Inbrija  treatment  does  not  contribute  to 
pulmonary function impairment regardless of baseline pulmonary status or the number of daily Inbrija 
inhalations.

Adverse Events of Fractures 
The  incidence  of  fracture  AEs  were  similar  between  Pool  1  CVT-301  (0.7%)  and  placebo  (1.3%)  and 
between Pool 2 (4.3%) and the observational cohort (3.9%). The same query was conducted for medical 
history of fracture to identify any baseline propensity for fracture. A medical history of fracture was more 
prevalent in placebo (12.3%) versus Pool  1 CVT-301 (6.3%), while a medical  history  of fracture was 
similar between Pool 2 (8.7%) and the observational cohort (6.3%). The incidence rate of fracture AEs 
per 100 subject-years was lower in Pool 1 CVT-301 (3.8 events) compared to placebo (7.3 events), but 
higher in Pool 2 (7.7 events) compared to the observational cohort (3.9 events). Overall, the absolute 
incidence of fractures was low, and the incidence rate per 100 subject-years in Pool 2 was consistent with 
the risk of fractures in PD reported in literature (5.9 fracture incidence per 100 participant-years). 
Laboratory findings 
There were no clear trends in shifts from baseline for out-of-range values in hematological parameters at 
Months 1 to 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15, and no notable differences between the  Inbrija-treated group and the 
placebo group or observational cohort. 
There were no notable differences in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 
heart rate or respiration rate observed prior to dose across all 3 analysis pools and the observational 
cohort.  
Across all Inbrija studies, there were few potentially clinically significant changes in ECG, and no notable 
difference between Inbrija-treated subjects and placebo-treated subjects or subjects in the observational 
cohort. No safety signals have been identified for any ECG parameters. 
Safety in special populations 
Due to the pulmonary route of administration subjects with chronic  lung diseases, such as asthma or 
COPD  can  be  regarded  as  special  population.  The  applicant  performed  a  study  in  asthmatic  subjects 
(Study  008)  who  were  otherwise  healthy  that  showed  that  bronchospasm  can  occur.  The  effects  on 
bronchospasm  in patients with  other pulmonary diseases,  e.g.  COPD patients,  were  not  investigated. 
Therefore, an appropriate statement was added to the SmPC, stating that the use of levodopa inhalation 
powder  in  patients  with  asthma,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD),  or  other  chronic 
underlying lung disease is not recommended.  
While  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  among  the  three  age  groups,  there  appears  to  be  a 
numerically higher incidence in specific AEs in the age group of 75 to 84 years.  The most common AE in 
Pool 3 in all three age groups was cough with an incidence of 15.4%, 14.7%, and 21.0% with age groups 
< 65 years, 65 to < 75 years, and 75 to 84 years, respectively. The second most common AE in Pool 3 was 
fall with incidence of 7.3%, 9.5%, and 12.9% with age groups < 65 years, 65 to < 75 years, and 75 to 84 
years,) respectively. The AEs that occurred in > 5% of patients in Pool 3 in all three age groups were 
dyskinesia (5.6%, 5.3%, and 8.1% with age groups < 65 years, 65 to < 75 years, and 75 to 84 years, 
respectively) and upper respiratory tract infection (5.3%, 6.3%, and 6.5% with age groups < 65 years, 
65 to < 75 years, and 75 to 84 years, respectively).

It is considered that the use in very elderly patients (>75) needs to be monitored within PSUR. The SmPC 
reflects that there are limited data available for very elderly patients.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies were conducted with  Inbrija. All subjects on Inbrija were also on a 
background  regimen  of  levodopa/DDI  (either  carbidopa  or  benserazide).  With  some  exceptions  (e.g. 
apomorphine, which was prohibited), subjects were allowed to take concomitant PD medications. 
The  applicant  presented  literature  data,  known  for  LD  or  LD/CD  interaction.  No  studies  have  been 
conducted to examine drug-demographic interactions or drug-disease interactions of Inbrija.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the placebo-controlled studies (Pool 1), AEs led to withdrawal from the study in 10 (3.7%)  Inbrija 
-treated subjects and 6 (3.9%) placebo-treated subjects.  
In the long-term studies, AEs led to withdrawal from the study in 47 (8.1%) subjects treated with Inbrija 
(Pool 2). Among all Inbrija -treated subjects (Pool 3), 57 (8.1%) subjects withdrew from the study due to 
AEs. Among all Inbrija -treated subjects, cough was the most commonly reported AE leading to study 
withdrawal (13 [1.8%]). No placebo subjects withdrew from the study due to cough. Hallucination and 
throat  irritation  led  to  study  discontinuation  in  3  (0.4%)  subjects  each,  and  bronchitis,  dyskinesia, 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 75/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dyspnea, euphoric mood, upper respiratory tract irritation and blurred vision led to study discontinuation 
in 2 (0.3%) subjects each. All other AEs leading to withdrawal were reported for 1 subject each. One 
subject in the Pool 1 Inbrija treatment group (Study CVT-301-004) reported a spirometry-associated AE 
(spirometry abnormal) resulting in withdrawal from the study. 
Adverse events leading to withdrawal from the study were analyzed by daily dose frequency (mean daily 
dose < median; mean daily dose ≥ median). The incidence of AEs leading to withdrawal from the study in 
Pool 3 was higher in subjects with mean daily dose < median (8.2%) compared to subjects with mean 
daily  dose  ≥  median  (5.7%),  but  the  difference  remained  small.  There  was  no  clinically  meaningful 
difference between the two subgroups in AEs leading to withdrawal from the study. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety if Inbrija treatment has been determined in four multiple-dose studies in PD subjects (Studies 
CVT-301-003, CVT-301-004, CVT-301-004E and CVT-301-005). 
An adequate number of PD patients were exposed to multiple Inbrija doses in placebo-controlled studies 
(270 patients) and in long-term uncontrolled or observational cohort-controlled studies (583 patients) to 
allow a comprehensive safety assessment. Data on the long-term (6 months or more) adverse effects of 
Inbrija are available from Study CVT-301-004E (up to 12 to 15 months) and Study CVT-301-005 (up to 
12 months). Long-term pulmonary safety was evaluated using spirometry and DLco (carbon monoxide 
diffusing capacity). 
Post-hoc analyses on the integrated safety datasets for Inbrija 84 mg group only using the data from 
Studies CVT-301-004, CVT-301-004E, and CVT-301-005 were performed regarding the number of 
patients exposed to CVT-301 84 mg, 5 times daily, for > 3 months, > 6 months, and > 12 months. 
Among the 469 exposed patients, 166 patients took ≥ 5 doses per day at least once. 
The safety profile of Inbrija is consistent with the known safety profile of levodopa, along with the addition 
of cough associated with the inhalation of a dry powder. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in 
the Inbrija clinical studies were cough (15.6%), fall (8.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (5.8%), 
dyskinesia (5.7%) and sputum discoloured (2.8%). No events of fall were considered at least possibly 
causally drug-related by the investigators. The acute and chronic pulmonary safety evaluations showed 
no notable differences between treatment with Inbrija compared to a placebo or observational control in 
spirometry parameters and DLco. Evaluations of vital signs, clinical laboratory, and ECG showed no 
apparent safety signals. 
In general, the Pool analysis showed that the reported adverse events did not differ between short term 
and  long  term  exposure  and  thus  do  not  change  over  time.  The  submitted  data  concerning  upper 
respiratory tract infection, indicate that that this AE was not only reported more frequently in the 84 mg 
dose compared to placebo, but also lasted longer compared to placebo and the observational cohort. As 
the route of administration leads to relative more respiratory tract related adverse events reported, use 
in (chronic) pulmonary disorder (asthma, COPD) is mentioned in the SmPC in the section warning and 
precaution. It is difficult to conclude based on these data whether the efficacy is compromised or not in 
case of a concomitant upper respiratory tract infection. Therefore it is advised in the SmPC section 4.4 to 
leave  the  decision  whether  to  discontinue  the  use  of  the  product  temporarily  or  permanently,  to  the 
patient and medical professional, as Inbrija treatment is an on-demand, add-on treatment. 
The CHMP concluded that there was no increased abuse potential with the use of an on-demand system 
as Inbrija because the frequency of events related to potential abuse was similar between the placebo 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 76/87 
 
  
 
 
 
controlled studies and the long term studies. Dizziness and hallucination were also reported with a high 
frequency in the placebo arm.  
Overall, the clinical experience in supports the conclusion that Inbrija was well tolerated as an adjunctive 
treatment for PD subjects experiencing motor fluctuations. The totality of safety data from Studies 
CVT-301-003, CVT-301-004E, CVT-301-004 and CVT-301-005 and the high frequency of use complies 
with the ICH E1 requirements for safety. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The most frequent adverse events reported in are cough, upper respiratory tract infection, throat 
irritation, sputum discoloured, dyskinesia, dizziness, hallucinations, fall, and nasopharyngitis. They were 
either adverse events already known for levodopa or related to the route of administration. The route of 
administration leads to irritation of the pulmonary tract, however the lung functions are not affected.  
Based on individual assessments of the severity of the intercurrent respiratory infection Inbrija may be 
continued or discontinued until the respiratory symptoms resolve. This particular safety issues will be 
monitored closely within PSURs. 
Because of the risk of bronchospasm, use of levodopa inhalation powder in patients with asthma, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other chronic underlying lung disease is not recommended. 
The applicant will monitor closely respiratory compromised patients, the ADR cough and use in current 
smokers in post-marketing setting.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) occur with PD progression, when patients are no longer able to store 
dopamine in dopaminergic neurons, due to progressive degeneration of dopamine neurons. OFF episodes 
can be unpredictable and may impact patient’s quality of life greatly. 
Inbrija is a dry powder formulation of LD for inhalation. Capsules contain powder for oral inhalation and 
breath-actuated inhaler. The combination of particle size and formulation composition has been designed 
to provide therapeutic levels of LD following inhalation and absorption into the pulmonary circulation. 
The applicant initially sought approval for the indication: 
 “Treatment of symptoms of OFF periods in Parkinson’s disease as an adjunct to a dopa-decarboxylase 
inhibitor/levodopa regimen.”  
The approved indication is: 
“Intermittent treatment of episodic motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) in adult patients with Parkinson’s 
disease (PD) treated with a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor.” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment of an OFF episode is managed most frequently by oral administration of either a scheduled or 
unscheduled dose of LD, which is associated with a considerable variability in response and can require >1 
hour to improve motor function. Dispersible tablets for dose dispenser with a dose of 5mg/1.25mg LD/CD 
per tablet was registered in 2016, allowing individualized therapy and administration of optimum daily 
dose. The Cmax of this product occurs approximately 30 minutes after dose. Treatment of OFF episodes 
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019  
Page 79/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
in more advanced stages of PD can be achieved with subcutaneous apomorphine injection in patients on 
stable oral anti-Parkinson medication. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical program consisted of 10 studies examining the efficacy, PK and safety in healthy voluntaries, 
PD patients and special populations, i.e. asthmatic subjects and smokers.  
Study 004 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, evaluating the efficacy 
of Inbrija in 343 PD patients with OFF periods. The study duration was 12 weeks.  
The primary endpoint was a change in UPDRS-III at 30 minutes post-dose compared to pre-dose OFF 
motor at 12 weeks.  
After  the  treatment  phase  of  12  weeks,  subjects  could  enter  an  extension  phase  (study  004E).  The 
subjects  on  active  treatment  continued  with  their  treatment  dose  and  subjects  on  placebo  were 
re-randomized to 60mg or 84mg. Follow up was up to 52 weeks and blinding was maintained.  
Study 003 was a randomized, multicentre, placebo-controlled study, assessing the efficacy of Inbrija in 
89 PD patients. Subjects were similar to the population in study CVT-301-004. The primary endpoint was 
change in UPDRS-III motor score at 10-60 minutes post-dose at week 4 assessed in a similar clinical 
setting as study CVT-301-004.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The results from the pharmacokinetics investigation of Inbrija, confirm that it can deliver successfully 
levodopa plasma levels (>400 ng/ml) needed for a meaningful improvement of OFF periods faster and 
independently from food intake compared to oral levodopa administration (20 min compared to 45 and 
120 min after oral fasted and oral fed). The proposed inhalation levodopa dose is lower than the usual oral 
doses and therefore has a lower risk of inducing dyskinesia (at levodopa plasma levels above 800 ng/mL). 
The efficacy of Inbrija was supported by Study CVT-301-003 and confirmed in Study CVT-301-004. The 
available efficacy data show that Inbrija provides an effective and timely improvement of motor 
symptoms within 30 minutes when given on top of background oral LD/DDI during an OFF period. This 
motor improvement is considered clinically relevant and beneficial, which is also reflected by the 
reduction of mean daily OFF time an improvement on the PGI-C score (a patient reported outcome of the 
overall improvement and satisfaction) in subjects in the treatment arms. The effects were consistent 
across trials and dose, with generally a larger effect observed in the Inbrija 84 mg compared to the 60 mg 
dose group.  
Overall, the clinical safety experience supports the conclusion that Inbrija’s safety profile is consistent 
with the known safety of levodopa and that it was well tolerated as an adjunctive treatment for PD 
subjects experiencing motor fluctuations.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Exposure-response analyses indicated a numerically better response with a higher increase in levodopa 
concentrations upon Inbrija treatment and in patients with high levodopa plasma levels at onset of the 
OFF period 15 min after Inbrija administration.  However, the data are considered exploratory because of 
the low numbers included in the analysis, i.e. 24 patients. A rapid treatment effect has not conclusively 
been shown in the clinical trials. Moreover, a statistically significant difference in the UPDRS-III between 
placebo and Inbrija 84 mg is observed after 30 minutes.  
The primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints are assessed in a ‘clinical setting’, i.e. waiting for an 
OFF  period  to  occur.  The  clinical  relevance  of  the  UPDRS-III  result  is  supported  by  the  statistically 
superior result in responder ON within 60 minutes at Week 12 and the subject-reported improvement on 
the PGI-C rating scale at Week 12 favouring Inbrija treatment over placebo. 
A difference in mean total daily OFF time between Inbrija and placebo is more evident in a more severe 
PD patient population. When the patient population is less severe, the sensitivity of the PD diary may not 
be sufficient to detect a difference for an intermittent treatment that is used on an as needed basis. 
There is only a limited amount of subjects within the worst-case scenario (when the highest daily doses 
of Inbrija were taken in addition to the maximum doses of baseline therapy) available for assessment, 
therefore this subgroup requires monitoring post-marketing. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The adverse events were pooled for the placebo controlled short term, study (Pool 1), long term study 
(Pool 2) and for the observational cohort. The most frequent reported adverse events and related to the 
drug  or  route  of  administration  are  dyskinesia  (0.6%;  3.7%;  5.5%;  3.9%),  cough  (1.9%;  13.7%; 
13.7%;  0.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (1.9%;  3.3%;  5.5%; 0.8%),  throat  irritation (0.6%; 
3.3%; 3.1%; -), sputum discoloured (- ; 3.0%; 1.4%; -), reported for placebo, CVT-301 Pool 1, CVT-301 
Pool 2, and the observation cohort, respectively.  
In Study 004, upper respiratory tract infection lasted 10 days in placebo, 10 days in CVT-301 60 mg 
taking and 17 days in CVT-301 84 mg cohort. This particular safety issues will be monitored closely within 
PSURs. 
Study 008 performed showed that bronchospasm can occur in non-PD asthmatic subjects. The effects on 
bronchospasm in PD patients with other pulmonary diseases, e.g. COPD patients, were not investigated 
and  therefore  the  use  of  Inbrija  is  not  recommended.  The  applicant  will  monitor  closely  respiratory 
compromised patients, the ADR cough and use in current smokers in post-marketing setting. 
There was only a small number of subjects aged 75-84 and no subjects aged >84 included in studies.  
Taking into account that the use in very likely it was recommended to monitor the use in >75 within PSUR. 
The  SmPC  has  been  updated  highlighting  that  there  are  only  limited  data  available  for  very  elderly 
patients.  
Adverse event related to abuse potential included: euphoric mood (0.3%, Pool 2 only), impulse control 
disorder (0.2%, Pool 2 only), dopamine dysregulation syndrome (0.2% pool 2 only), dizziness (4.5%, 
2.2%, 2.2%, 0.8%), hallucination (1.3%, 1.5%, 1.7%, 0.8%) and (for Pool 1 placebo, Pool 1 CVT-301, 
CVT-301 Pool 2 and observational cohort, respectively).

Page 81/87 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The percentage of adverse events reported in the short term pooled and long term pooled data are 
generally similar. However, as the adverse events are presented in a short term data pool and a long term 
data pool, and not per dose, it is unknown how this relates to the 60 mg and 84 mg dose. As the adverse 
event profile of levodopa is well known, the difference in low dose and high dose is small. Small amounts 
are given on top of background levodopa treatment on an on demand basis, and are not expected to 
significantly affect the safety profile.  
The route of administration leads to relative more respiratory tract related adverse events, e.g. 
respiratory infections, cough. Respiratory tract infections appear to be related to the dose, as the duration 
of infection is prolonged in the higher dose. Therefore, respiratory tract infection will be monitored in the 
PSUR and the SmPC warns that, based on individual assessments of the severity of the intercurrent 
respiratory infection, Inbrija may be continued or discontinued until the respiratory symptoms resolve. 
Bronchospasm has been seen in non-PD asthmatic subjects and there is limited data regarding chronic 
effect of Inbrija in respiratory compromised patients, therefore use of levodopa inhalation powder in 
patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other chronic underlying lung 
disease is not recommended. The effect of cough in respiratory compromised population and smokers is 
unknown; this will be monitored in the PSUR. 
Although the frequency of adverse events relating to potential abuse are observed in the Inbrija exposed 
group with higher frequency than seen in the observational cohort, these are known effects of LD and are 
therefore incorporated in the SmPC. 
There is only limited data in very elderly patients (≥75 years) and therefore the use of Inbrija will be 
monitored within PSUR. 
Inbrija has not been studied in patients with renal impairment and therefore it is recommended to 
administer this medicinal product cautiously to patients with severe renal disease. 
Inbrija has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and therefore it is recommended to 
administer this medicinal product cautiously to patients with severe hepatic impairment.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The pulmonary delivery of the active allows for a more rapid increase in levodopa plasma concentrations 
compared to regular oral LD/CD formulation. The Cmax is reached after approximately 20 minutes 
compared to 45-120 minutes of Sinemet IR.  Subjects who started inhaled levodopa on top of background 
LD/CD medication, after the emerging of an OFF episode, had a quicker improvement in the UPDRS-III 
motor score as compared to placebo. The UPDRS III score improved with -9.83. - 8.98 and –5.91 points 
within 30 minutes for levodopa inhaler 48mg, levodopa inhaler 66mg and placebo respectively. Despite 
the fact that the available data did not show a statistically significant or clinically relevant differences 
between placebo and UPDRS-III within the first 10-20 minutes (which would have been considered a 
rapid effect), Inbrija has the benefit that the increase in levodopa plasma concentrations is independent 
of food intake, which is in contrast to the available oral formulations, which are influenced by fed and 
fasted state.  
Preventing  an upcoming OFF period from becoming a full-blown one suggests that there will be an 
improvement in motor function, which would also be translated in a reduction in total daily OFF time in the 
real-life setting. This was reflected by a greater numerical difference in more severe patients in reduction 
of OFF time, and the significant reduction in daily OFF time seen in study CVT-301-003 at 4 weeks.  
The safety of Inbrija is in line with that of levodopa medicinal products. The applicant presented pooled 
data for short term, 4-12 weeks, and long term, up to 52 weeks, exposure. Adverse events of special 
interests were adverse events related to the route of administration, such as respiratory tract infection, 
cough, and throat irritation. The assessment of pulmonary parameters showed that these were 
unchanged compared to the placebo-treated groups. However, some patients suffered from respiratory 
tract infections during the study. It is unclear if the respiratory tract infection compromises the efficacy or 
safety of Inbrija. Based on individual assessments of the severity of the intercurrent respiratory infection 
Inbrija may be either continued or discontinued until the respiratory symptoms resolve. 
Because of the risk of bronchospasm (seen in non-PD asthmatic subjects), use of Inbrija in patients with 
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other chronic underlying lung disease is not 
recommended.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Inbrija is a pulmonary delivery of levodopa only and should, therefore, be administered with background 
LD/CD  oral formulation. The efficacy and  safety data are  in line  with  known  efficacy and  safety  from 
clinical experience with LD/CD products.  
A  rapid  relief  of  an  OFF  period  was  aimed  at,  hence  justifying  the  pulmonary  delivery  route.  This  is 
considered a worthwhile treatment goal on its own as OFF periods are recognized to greatly affect the 
quality of life of PD patients.  
The pharmacokinetics of Inbrija indicate that a rise in levodopa plasma concentration of > 400 ng/ml can 
be reached 10 min after inhalation compared to approximately 30 min (fasted) or > 1 hour (following a 
meal)  for  regular  oral  administration.  The  current  formulation  has  the  benefit  that  when  properly 
administered, levodopa absorption is unaffected by food intake.  
EMA/CHMP/450567/2019 
Page 85/87 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Clinical  relevance,  e.g.  translation  from  the  artificial  setting  to  real  life  setting,  is  considered 
demonstrated by  the  improvement of UPDRS-III  score, responders ON and patient-reported outcome 
PGI-C.  Moreover,  more  considerable  numerical  differences  in  reduction  of  daily  OFF-time  between 
placebo and treatment arms were observed in more severe PD patients, e.g. patients with ≥3 doses or 
patients with longer daily OFF episodes.  
Due to the known safety profile of levodopa, the additional safety concerns relate to the route of 
administration. The SmPC advices that based on individual assessments of the severity of the intercurrent 
respiratory infection Inbrija may be continued or discontinued until the respiratory symptoms resolve. 
Because of the risk of bronchospasm, use of levodopa inhalation powder in patients with asthma, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other chronic underlying lung disease is not recommended. 
Overall, the data from the presented studies show that Inbrija provides a clinically relevant improvement 
of episodic motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease treated with a 
levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable.

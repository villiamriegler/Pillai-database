Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for fosaprepitant, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
During the interval 8 cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported, 19 cases cumulatively. Two of 
the 19 cases, both reporting anaphylactic shock, presented without confounding factors. Based on 
the case analysis an update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of product characteristic to 
include information on anaphylactic reactions and shock is recommended.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing fosaprepitant were warranted. 
The important identified risk of hypersensitivity is recommended to be updated with information on 
anaphylactic reactions/shock; this change can be implemented at the next regulatory opportunity 
requiring an update of the RMP. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for fosaprepitant the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing fosaprepitant is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) – also known as Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) – and 
microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are both associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) 
and are therefore referred to collectively as ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). The causative role of 
ANCAs in generating small-vessel vasculitis has been demonstrated in several in-vitro and in-vivo 
models. Two types of ANCA have been identified in GPA and MPA, defined by the antigenicity against 
two different self –antigens which are the endogenous enzymes; MPO (myeloperoxidase) and PR3 
(proteinase-3) that are present in neutrophilic lymphocytes. ANCA-serology has a different distribution 
between GPA and MPA. GPA is mainly associated with PR3-ANCA (95% of the cases), whereas MPA is 
more frequently associated with MPO-ANCA (75% of MPA patients). 
AAV are rare disorders, with an estimated yearly incidence of 1 in 100,000 in Europe. The clinical 
features of GPA and MPA largely overlap, as necrotizing vasculitis may occur in the same organs. In 
GPA, crusting granulomata in the ear, nose and throat area and alveolar bleeding are the most 
prominent feature, and segmental, necrotizing glomerulonephritis may occur in about 50% of the 
cases. In MPA, glomerulonephritis is the most prominent feature present in virtual all patients, 
whereas the respiratory tract may be spared. In both GPA and MPA, vasculitis may be extended to 
other organs like the skin, nervous system, heart and gastrointestinal (GI) tract (mesenterium). CNS 
involvement is relatively rare for both disorders. Systemic features (fever, arthritis) are more common 
in MPA. The distinction between both entities is made by histology. 
Until the late 1960s the prognosis of WG was poor, with mortality rate of 80% within 1 year, mainly 
because of renal failure and GI/alveolar bleedings. With the introduction of cyclophosphamide therapy 
in the 1970s, prognosis has significantly improved, with reported remission rates of flares of 70-90%, 
and survival rate of 80% in 5 years. Mortality is also reduced by improved supportive care of renal 
failure. The clinical response to induction therapy with cyclophosphamide (CYC) is reported to be 
similar for MPA and GPA, although the relapse-rate is reported to be higher for PR-3 ANCA positive 
GPA (60-80% within 2 years) than for MPA (about 30%). In general, GPA relapses are more 
progressive of nature (i.e. more severe symptoms and more organs involved), than for MPA. 
However CYC is associated with significant toxicity, such as uro-toxicity (haemorrhagic cystitis, bladder 
cancer), cardio-toxicity, malignancies (lymphoma, thyroid cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer), 
lymphopenia and neutropenia, serious and opportunistic infections, thrombocytopenia and reduced 
fertility. Because of its toxicity, its use is limited to short-term induction therapy of severe flares, 
followed by maintenance therapy with other, in general better-tolerated immune-suppressant agents, 
like AZA (azathioprine), MFM (mycophenolate mofetil) or MTX (methotrexate). Mild-isolated cases of 
GPA granulomata may be treated with MTX alone. In a recent series, encompassing a mean follow-up 
of 17.8 months, 50% of participants suffered either severe or life-threatening adverse effects 
associated with conventional therapies. Since currently available therapies are associated with 
significant toxicities, as well as disease relapses when therapy is tapered or discontinued, there is a 
need for novel, more specific treatment approaches. 
The rationale of developing B-cell targeting therapy with rituximab in AAV is that the number of 
activated B cells in the periphery has been shown to correlate with the extent of disease activity. 
Short-lived plasma cells, thought to be a major source of pathogenic autoantibodies like ANCAs, are 
the terminally differentiated progeny of antigen-specific B-cell precursors. Without their B-cell 
precursors, short-lived plasma cells disappear after about 2 weeks.

Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against CD20, a cell surface antigen expressed on B-lymphocytes. 
It depletes peripheral CD19/20 positive B cells, thereby reducing the production of antibodies, 
including those related to autoimmune reactions. Anti-CD20 therapy effectively eliminates most 
circulating B cells, while allowing restoration of much of the B-cell lineage once B cell production 
resumes. Thus, by depleting CD20 positive B cells, rituximab may disrupt critical B-cell contributions to 
disease and suppress autoantibody production and could potentially contribute to the restoration of B-
cell tolerance to ANCA antigens. 
In the European Union (EU), rituximab intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with glucocorticoids, 
was approved on 22 April 2013 for the induction of remission in adult patients with severe, active GPA 
and MPA (EMEA/H/C/000165/II/0079). The purpose of the current application is to extend the 
indication to include the use of rituximab for maintenance treatment of patients with GPA and MPA who 
are in remission. 
The other currently approved indications for Mabthera include Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL), 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) and 3rd line treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). 
The current submission was based on the results from one investigator sponsored pivotal Phase III 
trial (Study ML22514/MAINRITSAN I), which evaluated the efficacy and safety of rituximab versus 
azathioprine for the prevention of disease relapse. 
The following indication was proposed: 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis 
MabThera, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in treatment 
of adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and 
microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The pharmacologically active substance in MabThera, Rituximab (CAS 174722–31–7), is a recombinant 
immunoglobulin-G monoclonal antibody with a molecular mass of approximately 145 kD. 
As an unaltered protein, Rituximab is predicted to be metabolised by regular proteinolysis in the 
patient and biodegraded in sewage treatment, as shown for other monoclonal antibodies. Thus, 
Rituximab is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment and therefore it is submitted that 
it does not need a formal ERA according to the EMA 2006 Guideline (corr. 2). 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application Rituximab is unlikely to result in a significant 
risk to the environment.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The claim of the indication extension is based on data from a single pivotal study, ML22514 
(MAINRITSAN I) which is a multicentre, randomized, open-label study comparing rituximab treatment 
against azathioprine, a current standard of care treatment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
When Study ML22514 was designed, no pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments were planned. The MAH 
explored the potential use of frozen serum samples from this study to determine whether they could 
be used retrospectively to determine rituximab concentrations. However, most of the samples were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/62482/2020  
Page 8/70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outside the window of controlled PK stability (3.5 years) for which rituximab concentrations could be 
accurately quantified. Therefore, rituximab concentrations were only determined in samples used for 
the measurement of serum anti-drug antibody (ADA), to aid in the interpretation of the ADA data. 
Although no PK data are available from Study ML22514, the ITN021AI (RAVE) study, which also 
enrolled patients with GPA/MPA, did provide clinical pharmacology information which is relevant to the 
GPA/MPA patient population that was investigated in Study ML22514. 
In RAVE, rituximab treatment consisted of four weekly IV infusions of 375 mg/m2, on the first day of 
weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Rituximab levels were evaluated prior to the first and third doses, then on Days 
29, 60, 120, 180, 270, and 545 from the first dose. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling (with software 
NONMEM) was used to analyse the PK data from a total of 97 patients in the rituximab group. The 
structural model that best described rituximab PK was a two-compartment linear model. The typical 
population estimates (% standard error of estimates [SEE]) of rituximab clearance (CL), and volume of 
distribution in central compartment (V1) were 0.289 L/day (4.39%), and 4.42 L (3.21%), respectively. 
The inter-patient variability (%SEE) for CL, and V1 were 42.1% (13.8%), and 26.8% (18.9%), 
respectively. The median of individual estimates of t1/2 of rituximab was 23.4 days (range: 9.38-48.7 
days). Sex and ADA were the two covariates with the largest effect on inter-individual variability on CL. 
Men had approximately 31.4% faster CL than women. ADA-positive patients had 37% faster clearance 
than ADA-negative patients and ADA-positive patients were associated with shorter t1/2 than ADA-
negative patients (19.0 vs. 25.6 days). Sex and body surface area (BSA) were the two covariates with 
the largest effect on the inter-individual variability on V1. Men had 21.6% larger V1 than women. 
Patients associated with larger BSA had larger V1. Volume of distribution in central compartment was 
18% larger for a BSA of 2.30 m2. The estimate of t1/2, based on the final model was very similar 
between men and women (23.6 and 24.9 days, respectively). Mean PK parameters summarized in 
Table 2. 
Table 2 RAVE study: Summary Statistics of Rituximab PK Parameters 
AUC0-inf=area under concentration time curve from time 0 to infinity; CL=clearance; n=number of patients; PK=pharmacokinetic; 
SD=standard derivation; t1/2=half-life determined by elimination phase; V1=volume of distribution in central compartment. 
Overall, the population PK parameters for rituximab in patients with GPA/MPA are similar to those 
estimated for other Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Rituximab PK in the GPA/MPA patient 
population also appears to be similar to that observed in patients with RA. Given the moderate inter-
patient variability and the moderate covariates effect on CL and V1, these findings suggest that the 
tested covariates (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, albumin, BSA, sex and ADA) have no clinically relevant 
effect on rituximab PK and that no dose adjustments based on the demographic or physiological 
variables are needed. 
Figure 1 shows the predicted concentration-time profiles for rituximab, using the PK parameters from 
Study ITN021AI, and the rituximab doses from the ML22514 trial, i.e. 500 mg on Day 1 and 15 
followed by a dose of 500 mg every 6 months. Simulations were conducted in 130 patients by taking 
into account the expected baseline characteristics (i.e. age, gender, BSA, and presence of ADA) of the 
patients and were run 100 times to determine the median, 5th and 95th percentile predicted PK

profiles. For the simulations, 50% of the patients were men, the median (P5-P95) BSA was 1.84 (1.46-
2.28) m2, and 21% of the patients were ADA-positive. The 13000 simulated PK time courses were 
summarized using median concentration-time profiles and 5th and 95th percentiles (90% prediction 
interval) and are shown in Figure 1. 
Blue area and solid red line represent the 90% prediction interval (PI) of simulated rituximab concentrations and the corresponding 
median among 13000 simulations with the population PK model previously developed in patients with GPA/MPA

With Rituximab 500 mg on Day 1, Day 15, and at Month 6, Month 12 and Month 18 
With the dosing regimen used in the Study ML22154, rituximab concentrations are expected to be 
similar to those observed using the dosing regimen in Study ITN021AI 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against CD20, a cell surface antigen expressed on B-lymphocytes. 
The binding of rituximab to CD20 on B lymphocytes promotes B cell lysis via a number of different 
possible mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis. The depletion of peripheral CD19/20 positive B cells reduces 
the production of antibodies, including those related to autoimmune reactions. Anti-CD20 therapy 
effectively eliminates most circulating B cells, while allowing restoration of much of the B-cell lineage 
once B cell production resumes. Thus, by depleting CD20 positive B cells, rituximab may disrupt critical 
B-cell contributions to disease and suppress autoantibody production and could potentially contribute 
to the restoration of B-cell tolerance to ANCA antigens. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
Study ML22514 did not have a prospective plan for immunogenicity assessment as part of the study 
protocol or schedule of assessments. Immunogenicity data and measurement of ADA was therefore 
analysed as a post-hoc evaluation by the MAH. Available stored serum samples, were requested 
retrospectively from the Sponsor at the following pre-dose time points: Day 1 (Infusion 1), Day 180 
(Month 6, Infusion 3), Day 365 (Month 12, Infusion 4), and Day 545 (Month 18, Infusion 5). ADA data 
were evaluated for patients in the rituximab arm only. ADA were measured using a bridging ELISA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/62482/2020  
Page 10/70 
 
 
 
 
Overall, samples were available for ADA analysis from 44 patients, broken down as follows: 
•  Baseline samples only: 10 patients 
•  Baseline plus at least 1 post-baseline sample: 26 patients 
• 
Post-baseline samples only: 8 patients 
Since 10 patients provided only baseline samples, a total of 34 patients were available for the 
immunogenicity assessment following rituximab administration. Of the 26 patients who provided a 
sample at baseline and at least one post-baseline sample, 4 patients developed rituximab-induced ADA 
at any point during the study. Of the 8 patients with post-baseline samples only (i.e. missing Day 1 
baseline sample), 2 patients were found to be ADA-positive at Month 12. In summary, 6/34 evaluable 
patients (18%) developed treatment-induced ADA; one first occurring at Month 6, four at Month 12, 
and one at Month 18. 
From the available data, the occurrence of ADA did not appear to have a negative effect on the efficacy 
of rituximab. Of the 3-rituximab treated patients who had a major relapse by month 28, none tested 
positive for ADA. When looking at the impact of ADA on safety, the data did not suggest a different 
safety profile in patients who tested positive for ADA post-baseline compared to those that tested 
negative. Furthermore, as expected, patients testing ADA-positive also experienced peripheral CD19 
count depletion following rituximab administration. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of rituximab used in an AAV population is relatively well established. The 
data primary derive from the pivotal study used for the approval of the induction therapy indication 
(Study ITN021AI) with participation of a total of 97 patients. Additional a PK simulation of predicted 
rituximab exposure is presented based on data from the pivotal study from the actual application 
(Study ML22154). 
Overall, there is no new data with regards to the basic PK properties including absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, elimination and excretion. The structural model that best described rituximab PK was a 
two-compartment linear model. The population estimates of rituximab clearance (CL), and volume of 
distribution in central compartment (V1) were 0.289 L/day and 4.42 L, respectively. The median of 
individual estimates of t1/2 of rituximab was 23.4 days. As supplement, the simulation of predicted 
rituximab exposure showed that the dosing regimen of Study ML22154 is expected to be similar to 
those observed using the dosing regimen of Study ITN021AI. Overall, the description of the PK seems 
appropriate. 
No new information regarding mechanism of action is presented. Rituximab mediate a depletion of 
CD20 positive B-cells and reduces the production of antibodies, including those related to autoimmune 
reactions. 
Immunogenicity data were analysed as a post-hoc evaluation which is considered acceptable. A total of 
34 patients were available for immunogenicity assessment following rituximab administration and 6 of 
34 (18%) developed treatment-induced ADA. It appeared, that the occurrence of ADA did not have a 
negative effect on the efficacy of rituximab. The presented data is considered sufficient. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Clinical pharmacology is sufficiently covered with data from the application for MabThera on the 
induction treatment indication and a PK simulation study. Overall, there is no new data with regards to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/62482/2020  
Page 11/70 
 
 
 
 
the basic PK properties. From a clinical pharmacology point of view, no unexpected findings of clinical 
relevance have been revealed and no concerns are identified. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose-response studies were submitted. The 500 mg rituximab dose used in the trial (ML22514) is 
lower than that used for induction or maintenance of remission in other conditions, such as rheumatoid 
arthritis. This dose was chosen because the investigators estimated that it might be appropriate for 
patients in remission (already B-cell depleted) at the start of maintenance treatment and could limit 
the risk of infection.

maintenance treatment of GPA/MPA 
Methods 
Study ML22514 is a therapeutic, prospective, Phase III, multi-centre, comparative, randomized, open-
label study comparing azathioprine versus rituximab in combination with low-dose corticosteroids for 
the maintenance treatment of GPA/MPA. 
Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to either rituximab or azathioprine; randomization was stratified 
by recently diagnosed or recurrent disease (Figure 2).  A priori, 66% of patients were newly diagnosed 
and 33% were in relapse.  Patients randomized to the rituximab arm received 500 mg intravenous (IV) 
on Day 1, Day 15, and Months 6, 12, and 18.  Patients randomized to the azathioprine arm received 
an oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 12 months, followed by a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day for 6 months, and 
finally 1 mg/kg/day for 4 months (treatment discontinuation after 22 months).  Following the 
enrolment visit (Day 1) and a Day 15 visit (patients on rituximab only), patients were monitored every 
3 months through Month 24, with a follow-up visit at Month 28. Hence, after the completion of 
maintenance treatment, patients in the rituximab arm were followed for 10 months while those in the 
azathioprine arm were followed for 6 months. Continuing the azathioprine maintenance treatment 
through Month 22, aimed to limit possible bias that could have been in favour of rituximab due to the 
prolonged pharmacodynamics effect (prolonged B cell depletion) anticipated to extend beyond the last 
infusion at Month 18. 
The 6-month interval between rituximab infusions was based on reported B-cell reconstitution and 
relapses after a median of 1 year (range, 4 to 37 months for relapses) in early studies of patients 
given rituximab for induction.

Inclusion Criteria 
The patients who met the following criteria were eligible for enrollment into the study:  
1.  Age 18 to 75 years (at the time of disease diagnosis) 
2.  ANCA-associated vasculitis:  GPA, MPA, and limited renal forms (pauci-immune 
glomerulonephritis) with or without ANCA (at the time of diagnosis as well as remission). There 
are 4 types of ANCA-associated vasculitis:  limited renal forms, GPA, MPA, and Churg-Strauss 
syndrome.  Only the first 3 of these diseases were investigated in this study.  However, ANCA 
are absent in certain types of vasculitis at the time of diagnosis.  Absence of ANCA was not 
considered an exclusion criterion as long as histological confirmation of the diagnosis was 
obtained.

platelet count. 
• 
Liver function was evaluated by transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels. 
•  Renal function was evaluated based on creatinine level and calculated clearance. 
These tests were performed in the study as part of the initial testing during the enrollment visit.

Treatments 
Induction therapy 
Patients who were not in remission at the time of study entry received induction therapy prior to 
randomization to maintenance therapy. According to standard of care in France, induction therapy 
included a combination of corticosteroids and an immunosuppressant, namely bolus doses of 
cyclophosphamide; oral cyclophosphamide and methotrexate were acceptable induction therapies. The 
investigator was free to define the initial treatment, provided that it did not include monoclonal 
antibodies such as anti-CD20 or anti-TNF-alpha. Plasma exchanges and/or immunoglobulins 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/62482/2020  
Page 15/70 
 
 
 
administered intravenously were permitted as part of the initial treatment. Corticosteroid treatment 
was left to the investigator’s discretion and was to be gradually tapered as the disease improved. 
Patients received remission-induction therapy for approximately 4 to 6 months until remission was 
attained. At that time, and within a maximum of 1 month after the last cyclophosphamide dose, 
eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1ratio (stratified by disease characteristic: 
newly diagnosed or relapsing disease) to receive maintenance therapy with rituximab or azathioprine. 
Maintenance therapy 
Rituximab administration: 
Rituximab was administered IV at a fixed dose of 500 mg in the month following discontinuation of the 
immunosuppressive therapy that led to remission. The first infusion occurred within 4 days after the 
enrolment visit. Subsequent infusions of rituximab were administered at the Day 15, Month 6, Month 
12, and Month 18 visits (5 infusions total), regardless of the ANCA titer and the level of circulating 
CD19+ lymphocytes. Before each infusion, the patients were pre-medicated with an 
analgesic/antipyretic drug (paracetamol), a short IV infusion of 100 mg methylprednisolone, and 5 mg 
dexchlorpheniramine. To avoid any risk of hypotension related to the infusion of rituximab, 
antihypertensive treatments were interrupted 12 hours before the rituximab infusion. Rituximab 
infusions were discontinued if signs of severe infusion related reactions (especially severe dyspnoea or 
bronchospasms) were detected. If the patient developed an initial allergic reaction during the first 
infusion, the administration of the product was permanently discontinued. If a patient developed a 
mild-to-moderate reaction during the first infusion, an antihistamine and corticosteroid treatment was 
recommended at the second infusion and patient care was reinforced with closer monitoring. 
Azathioprine administration: 
Azathioprine was administered orally at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 12 months, followed by 1.5 
mg/kg/day for 6 months, and finally 1 mg/kg/day for 4 months; treatment was discontinued after 22 
months. The daily dose, based on body weight, was rounded to the nearest multiple of 25, without 
exceeding 200 mg/day. Maintenance therapy was initiated in the month following discontinuation of 
the immunosuppressive therapy that led to the patient’s remission and no later than 8 days after the 
patient was included in the study. 
Corticosteroid administration: 
Corticosteroid treatment at study inclusion was left to the investigator’s discretion. The recommended 
initial dose of corticosteroids was prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day. During the study, and concurrent with 
sustained disease remission, prednisone treatment was tapered and then kept at a low dose 
(approximately 5 mg per day) for at least 18 months after randomization. Prednisone dose tapering 
and the decision to stop prednisone treatment after Month 18 were left to each site investigator’s 
discretion. Before each infusion of rituximab, there was a short IV infusion of 100 mg 
methylprednisolone. For a minor relapse (not life threatening nor involving a major organ), a modest 
increase in corticosteroid, up to 20 mg/day for 3 weeks, was allowed, with gradual tapering over a 
maximum of 6 weeks, returning to the dose level used before the minor relapse. Corticosteroid use 
was tracked in the patient diary. 
All other immunosuppressants and immunomodulators specifically intended to control vasculitis (eg, 
colchicine, dapsone, hydroxychloroquine, danazol) were prohibited for the duration of the study. If the 
disease worsened and required more intensive treatment, the patient was withdrawn from the study 
(premature withdrawal) and received treatment in accordance with current standard practices for 
vasculitis.

Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of rituximab as maintenance therapy 
for patients in remission from ANCA-related systemic vasculitis after a first exacerbation or relapse. 
Secondary objectives 
• 
• 
To evaluate rituximab tolerance compared to azathioprine 
To determine if reappearance of ANCA and/or increase in circulating levels of CD19+ B 
lymphocytes (CD19+ only for patients in the rituximab arm) was predictive of relapse 
occurrence. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with major relapse (reappearance or worsening of 
disease with Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) >0, and involvement of at least one major 
organ, a life-threatening manifestation, or both) at month 28 (18 months of treatment + 10 months of 
follow-up for the rituximab arm and 22 months of treatment + 6 months of follow-up for the 
Azathioprine arm). The definitions of remission and relapse are based on those formulated and 
adopted by experts of EUVAS/EULAR  
The percentages of patients with at least one major relapse in each treatment group were compared 
using the Pearson Chi-squared test, and the resulting p-value is reported. As part of the primary 
analysis, the time to first major relapse was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards regression, 
comparing treatment groups, and adjusting for the stratification factor (newly diagnosed vs. relapsing 
disease). The probabilities of a major relapse within the 28 month study period are presented by 
treatment group using Kaplan-Meier plots. The survival curves, from the date the maintenance therapy 
was started until the date of relapse, were compared between treatment groups using the log-rank 
test. Patients were censored at day of death or study withdrawal if it occurred before a major relapse. 
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary endpoints for the ML22514 study were separated in endpoints related to efficacy and 
endpoints related to safety. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
•  Number of patients with detectable ANCA in each treatment group 
•  Number of minor relapses in each treatment group 
•  A minor relapse is defined as reappearance or worsening of disease with Birmingham Vasculitis 
Activity Score (BVAS) > 0 without involvement of at least one major organ and/or without life-
threatening manifestation. 
•  Cumulative corticosteroid dose and duration of treatment in each group 10 months after 
completion of maintenance therapy 
The same endpoints will be assessed 6 months after the completion of maintenance therapy (post-
treatment observation phase). Patients experiencing a relapse during this phase of the study will be

treated with immunosuppressants in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), or with a new 
rituximab infusion (outside of the protocol) for those in the rituximab arm. 
Secondary endpoints related to safety: 
•  Number and seriousness of side-effects in each treatment group 
•  Mortality in each treatment group 
Additional analyses 
Efficacy analyses: 
•  BVAS values will be summarized with descriptive statistics by visit and treatment group 
• 
Immunological results, specifically CD19 percentage of total lymphocytes, total immunoglobin, 
IgG and IgM titers in each treatment group 
Safety analyses: 
• 
The number and seriousness of adverse events (related or not) in each treatment group 
•  Counts, descriptions and seriousness of adverse events which are infusion related reactions 
(IRRs) for the Rituximab arm 
• 
Exposure to Study Medication 
•  Adverse Events 
• 
Infusion Related Reactions 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on the assumption, that the rate of major relapse at 28 months 
after remission was expected to be 40% for the azathioprine arm. Rituximab was hypothesized to 
reduce the number of major relapses at Month 28 by an absolute difference of 25 percentage points. 
Under the assumption of 5% exclusion or dropout rates, with 80% statistical power and a two-sided 
alpha risk of 0.05%, a total of 118 patients had to be enrolled in the trial. 
Randomisation 
At the time of enrolment, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either rituximab or azathioprine 
using a computer based random assignment system for balanced random assignment of patients to 
treatment groups. The randomization sequence was generated in fixed blocks of size 4, within each 
randomization stratum (relapsers versus new diagnosis). The randomization list was established by 
Unite de Recherche Clinique (URC) Paris Centre in collaboration with the Agence Générale des 
Equipements et Produits de Santé (AGEPS), then integrated into the online randomization system 
(CleanWeb). Randomization was stratified based on whether the patient was newly diagnosed or had 
relapsing disease (in each treatment arm: approximately 2/3 newly diagnosed patients and 1/3 
patients with relapsing disease). The URC and AGEPS will be immediately notified of any patient 
enrollment/randomization through an automatic email/fax from the CleanWeb system. The AGEPS will 
ship the treatments (rituximab or azathioprine) to the site pharmacy (PUI) of each investigational 
center as soon an enrolment is confirmed and within 72 hours of receipt of the fax. 
Blinding (masking) 
As this was an open-label study, blinding procedures were not applicable.

Statistical methods 
All randomized patients comprise the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population, even if not actually treated. 
Results for ITT analyses are displayed according to the randomized treatment group. All results for 
study conduct is summarized by randomized group and by total patient population, and display 
frequencies with percentages wherever appropriate. A disposition table shows numbers and 
percentages of patients enrolled, completing the study and withdrawing. Numbers for different reasons 
of withdrawal is also shown. 
All statistical testing is two-sided with 5% Type I error with 95% confidence intervals. All efficacy 
analyses is done for the ITT population. The testing strategy is based on the primary endpoint only and 
no adjustment for multiplicity has been made for any secondary or supporting endpoints, as such, any 
p-values should therefore be interpreted with caution. 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics is summarized by randomized group and overall, and 
display frequencies with percentages for non-continuous variables or the number of non-missing 
values, means, standard deviations, medians, quartiles, minima and maxima for continuous variables. 
Medical history is included in the listing of baseline demographics and characteristics. 
Primary endpoint 
The percentages of patients with at least one major relapse in each treatment group, were compared 
with the Pearson Chi-squared test (or Fisher’s exact test with mid-p correction if frequencies are 
small), and the resulting p-value was reported.  
A supportive analysis of the primary result includes a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test to adjust 
for difference of disease flare category (new diagnosis or relapsing disease). This was added because 
the randomization was stratified by disease flare category. 
As part of the primary analysis, the time to first major relapse were analyzed with a Cox proportional 
hazards regression, comparing treatment groups, and adjusting for the stratification factor (new 
diagnosis vs. relapsers). Kaplan-Meier graphs of the probability of remaining free of major relapse by 
treatment group is also be presented. The survival curves, from the date the maintenance therapy was 
started until the date of relapse, is compared between treatment groups using the log-rank test. 
Patients were censored at death or study withdrawal if it occurred before a major relapse. 
Secondary endpoints 
All adverse events (AEs) were collected and described as they occurred. These AEs were graded by the 
investigator using CTCAE v4.0 criteria. Serious AEs were captured on a separate form. All AEs and 
SAEs were to be coded using MedDRA v20.0. An overall summary will be prepared to show the number 
of events and then number and percentage of patients with events for the following event types: all 
AEs, related AEs (possibly or probably related to rituximab or azathioprine), AEs leading to 
discontinuation, deaths (fatal AEs), SAEs, and related SAEs. Adverse events will be summarized for the 
Safety population by actual treatment group and overall, by System Organ Class (SOC), Preferred 
Term (PT), severity (intensity grade), relationship to investigational product (IP), with the number and 
percentage of patients exhibiting each of these adverse event types by actual treatment group and 
overall. 
The numbers and percentages of patients with detectable ANCAs at each visit were compared by 
treatment group with Pearson Chi-squared tests (or Fisher’s exact tests with mid-p correction if 
frequencies are small), and the resulting p-values was reported. 
Mortality in each treatment arm were summarized, if any. 
Assessment report

The percentages of patients with at least one minor relapse at or before Month 28, without a preceding 
major relapse, in each treatment group, were compared with the Pearson Chi-squared test (or Fisher’s 
exact test with mid-p correction if frequencies are small), and the resulting p-value was reported. As 
part of this analysis, the time to first minor or major relapse were analyzed with a Cox Proportional 
Hazards regression, comparing treatment groups, and adjusting for the stratification factor (new 
diagnosis vs. relapsers). Kaplan-Meier graphs of the probability of remaining free of minor relapse by 
treatment group were also be presented. The survival curves, from the date the maintenance therapy 
was started until the date of relapse, were compared between treatment groups using the log-rank 
test. Patients were censored at death or study withdrawal if it occurred before a relapse. 
The cumulative dose and duration of corticosteroid treatment for each patient were summarized by 
treatment group. 
The primary endpoints were analysed using the same methods as above but at the time point 6 
months after the end of the maintenance therapy (post-treatment follow-up). 
Additional endpoints 
Listings of major and minor relapses are presented along with patient characteristics and BVAS 
calculated at relapse. BVAS values are summarized with descriptive statistics by visit and treatment 
group. Immunological results, specifically CD19 percentage of total lymphocytes, total immunoglobin 
(Ig), IgG, and IgM titers are presented for each treatment group. 
Subgroup analyses 
An analysis of the primary endpoint were performed by subgroups of patients with and without 
detectable ANCAs. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 118 patients signed informed consent forms (Table 3). Of these, 117 patients were 
randomized 1:1 to treatment with rituximab (58 patients) or azathioprine (59 patients). One hundred 
fifteen patients (57 rituximab; 58 azathioprine) received study treatment during the study. Two 
patients were randomized but did not receive study, one who was randomized to receive rituximab, 
was not in remission at the time of enrolment and did not receive study treatment, and the other, who 
was randomized to receive azathioprine, withdrew consent prior to the first dose of study treatment. 
The proportion that completed the month 28 visit was 94.8% for the rituximab group compared with 
89.8% for the azathioprine group. 
More patients in the azathioprine arm (45.8%) compared with the rituximab arm (17.2%) prematurely 
discontinued study treatment (Table 3). Relapse of vasculitis (5.2% rituximab vs. 27.1% azathioprine) 
and discontinuations for safety (1.7% vs. 10.2%) mainly accounted for the overall higher incidence of 
discontinuations in the azathioprine arm. It is stated, that patients could have discontinued for more 
than one reason.

Table 3 Summary of Disposition of Patients by Trial Treatment (All Patients) 
Overall 9 patients, 3 in the rituximab group and 6 in the azathioprine group, discontinued before the 
Month 28 visit. The reason for the discontinuation does not appear clearly. One patient is stated to be 
lost to follow-up. The MAH was asked to provide more clear information on the reason(s) for the 
discontinuation of the 9 patients before the Month 28 visit.  The MAH subsequently provided tabulated 
descriptions of the reasons for discontinuation of treatment for the 9 patients. The response was 
considered sufficient and issue was resolved. 
Recruitment 
Patients were recruited from 49 sites in France; most sites recruited between 1 and 3 patients with the 
highest recruiting site (Site 1) enrolling 19 patients. The first patient enrolled on 07 October 2008, and 
the last patient’s last visit was 12 December 2012. A list of investigators who recruited patients and 
the investigator CVs is provided in the dossier. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
There were a total of 6 protocol amendments. Table 4 lists major changes to the protocol. Of 
importance, in protocol v2, dated 22 September 2008, the definition of a major relapse was revised 
from BVAS > 10 to be defined as the reappearance of clinical and/or biological signs of vasculitis 
activity which could be life threatening or lead to organ failure or destruction. 
Assessment report

Table 4 Summary of Major Changes to the Protocol 
Several amendments were made to the original protocol; however, none are considered critical with 
regards to study design, endpoints and objectives. The changes with regard to the definition of major 
relapse (primary endpoint), were implemented before enrolment of the first patient.  
Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations that were considered as major were identified in a post-hoc review by the study’s 
Scientific Director. Four patients were considered to have had major deviations as follows: 
Rituximab Arm 
•  One patient was incorrectly enrolled because the disease was not in remission 
•  One patient received an additional immunosuppressant (mycophenolate mofetil as a standard 
anti-rejection regimen after renal transplant) as of Month 16 
Azathioprine Arm 
•  One patient stopped taking study drug for 3 months, then resumed at the appropriate dose 
•  One patient had poor compliance between Month 12 and Month 18 
A listing of all deviations (major and minor) identified during the study was provided by the MAH. 
Overall, more than 100 minor and major deviations are listed across both treatment groups involving 
more than 60 patients. The MAH has presented brief narratives of the patients who presented with 
protocol violations. The MAH has provided tabulated overview of protocol violation stratified by the 
categories; inclusion criteria deviations, medication deviations and study protocol violations. Further, a 
more detailed description with frequencies within the categories is also presented. Overall, in 
consideration of the nature of the disease and the treatment, the deviations do not significantly 
influence the integrity of the trial.

Baseline data 
Demographics 
Table 5 Summary of Demographic Data by ITT 
The baseline demographics are not well-balanced between the two treatment arms with respect to 
gender and the age category >65 years. There are a relative larger proportion of men in the rituximab 
arm compared with the azathioprine arm. Further, there are a relative larger proportion of patients 
>65 years in the azathioprine group compared with the rituximab group.  
The MAH acknowledges that some baseline differences with regards to gender were observed in the 
ML22514 study. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH provided satisfactory analysis and discussion of the 
data and concluded that overall, the baseline differences in gender between the two study arms and 
within the RTX arm do not appear to have influenced response to rituximab or prognosis of the 
disease. The response on the baseline gender differences was considered sufficient by the CHMP. 
Regarding the baseline differences in age category, the RTX arm indeed enrolled fewer patients ≤ 65 
years (21% rituximab vs. 31% azathioprine). The baseline differences observed in the ML22514 study 
with regards to age are likely to be due to random chance and do not appear to have influenced 
response to rituximab treatment or prognosis of the disease. Data shows that rituximab consistently 
reduced the number of disease relapses in both age groups (above and below aged 65). The response 
was considered sufficient by the CHMP.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/62482/2020  
Page 24/70 
 
 
 
 
The treatment arms were comparable with respect to baseline disease characteristics (Table 6). 
In the overall study population, the majority had GPA (75%), followed by MPA (21%) and renal limited 
vasculitis (4%).  Compared with the azathioprine arm, more patients in the rituximab arm had GPA 
(83% rituximab vs 68% azathioprine) and fewer had MPA (14% vs 28%, respectively). The majority 
(80%) of enrolled patients were in remission after being newly diagnosed (baseline stratification 
factor).   
A majority of patients (63%) were ANCA-positive at inclusion, with a slightly lower incidence (55%) in 
the rituximab arm compared with the azathioprine arm (71%). 
Per protocol, the median BVAS at entry was 0.0 because all patients were expected to be in remission.  
Although Table 6 implies that one patient in each arm had a BVAS above 0, these were confirmed by 
the investigator to be data entry errors. 
Numbers analysed 
All 58 patients in the rituximab arm and 59 patients in the azathioprine arm were included in the ITT 
population; one patient signed an ICF but was not randomized, did not receive study medication, and 
was not included in the ITT population. Of these, 57 patients (98.3%) in the rituximab arm and 58 
patients (98.3%) in the azathioprine arm received at least one dose of study medication and were 
included in the safety population. All patients received the assigned treatment. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint of Study ML22514 was the percentage of patients with a major relapse by Month 
28. Significant fewer patients in the rituximab arm had experienced a major relapse by Month 28 
(5.2%), compared with the azathioprine arm (28.8%) (Table 7). The log-rank test showed that 
rituximab significantly reduced the incidence of major relapse (p=0.002). Adjusting for the 
stratification factor using Cox PH modelling, rituximab reduced the risk of major relapse by 
approximately 86% relative to azathioprine (HR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.47, p=0.0015).

Table 7 Time to First Major Relapse (Intent to Treat) 
The cumulative incidence rate curves showed a separation between arms in favor of rituximab that 
started from Month 2 and was maintained up to Month 28 (Figure 3). The taper in azathioprine dose, 
which started at Month 12, was not associated with an increased incidence of major relapse.

Secondary endpoint: Number of Patients with Detectable ANCAs in Each Group 
In the rituximab arm, the percentage of patients with detectable ANCAs decreased from 56.1% at 
baseline to 22.6% at Month 12 and remained relatively stable through Month 28 (27.3%).  In the 
azathioprine arm, the percentage of patients with detectable ANCAs decreased from 71.2% at baseline 
to 58.0% at Month 18 and fluctuated between 73.9% and 64.4% through Month 28 (Figure 4).   
Within treatment arms, the percentage of patients with detectable ANCAs was similar at baseline and 
at relapse (for those patients who relapsed).  In the rituximab arm, 32 of 57 patients (56.1%) had 
detectable ANCAs at baseline, compared with 5 of 9 patients (55.6%) at relapse.  In the azathioprine

arm, 42 of 59 patients (71.2%) had detectable ANCAs at baseline, compared with 17 of 24 patients 
(70.8%) at relapse.

Secondary endpoint: Major or Minor Relapses 
The incidence of minor relapses (as first relapse) by Month 28 was similar between treatment arms, 
12.1% for rituximab vs. 13.6% for azathioprine, p= 0.8095 (chi-squared test). The HR on the 
incidence of major or minor relapse was 0.31; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.70, p=0.0051. 
Secondary endpoint: Cumulative Dose and Duration of the Corticosteroid Treatment 
The median cumulative dose of corticosteroid treatment after the end of maintenance therapy was 
1457.5 mg in the rituximab arm and 905.0 mg in the azathioprine arm. The variability among patients 
was high, as seen with the large standard deviations as well as the wide range of values for each 
treatment arm (range: 124 to 5245 mg in the rituximab arm; 68 to 9693 mg in the azathioprine arm). 
The median daily dose was the same for each treatment arm (5.0 mg/day).

Table 8 Cumulative Dose and Duration of Corticosteroid Treatment After the End of 
Maintenance Therapy 
Since the time period was approximately 10 months for patients in the rituximab arm, and 
approximately 6 months for patients in the azathioprine arm, data for the six-month period after the 
last dose of study treatment (Month 18 to Month 24 for rituximab and Month 22 to Month 28 for 
azathioprine), were also presented (Table 9). The median total cumulative dose was similar between 
arms (912.5 mg rituximab; 905.0 mg azathioprine) but mean values was higher in the azathioprine 
arm compared with the rituximab arm (1252.1 mg vs. 903.2 mg). 
Table 9 Cumulative Dose and Duration of Corticosteroid Treatment up to 6 Months After the 
End of Maintenance Therapy 
The CHMP noted that post-maintenance treatment mean and median total cumulative dose of 
corticosteroid per patient was higher in the rituximab arm compared with the azathioprine arm (1447.4 
mg and 1457.5 vs. 1252.1 and 905.0 mg) at Month 28. This is not surprising, since the data was 
collected over 10 months and 6 months in the rituximab and azathioprine arms respectively. 
Comparison data for the six-month period after the last dose of study treatment were also presented 
by the MAH. The median total cumulative dose was similar between arms (912.5 mg rituximab; 905.0 
mg azathioprine), but mean values was higher in the azathioprine arm compared with the rituximab 
arm (1252.1 mg vs. 903.2 mg). The information provided from this comparison indicate, that the 
azathioprine treated patients could be more steroid demanding/sicker than the rituximab treated 
subjects, but the data only covers 6 of the 28 months of potential steroid treatment during the trial.

The mean total cumulative dose of prednisone is 6004.2 mg and 6988.8 mg for rituximab and 
azathioprine respectively. It appears that the pre-treatment 100 mg IV doses of methylprednisolone in 
the rituximab arm are not included in the data. The MAH was asked by the CHMP to provide data and 
discuss the results regarding the total cumulative corticosteroid dose over the full course of the study, 
including the pre-treatment methylprednisolone doses. According to the MAH, details of pre-medication 
and dosing were not routinely collected in the eCRF. The MAH explained, that if pre-treatment with 
methylprednisolone occurred as stated in the protocol, and that all patients in the RTX treatment arm 
received the full 100 mg IV dose of methylprednisolone prior to each infusion, the mean total 
cumulative corticosteroid dose would theoretically be 6611.7 mg for the RTX (compared to 6988.8 mg 
for the AZA arm). The MAH concluded that the pre-treatment 100 mg IV doses of methylprednisolone 
in the RTX arm do not appear to have had an impact on interpretation of efficacy or safety outcomes 
between the treatment arms. This conclusion was endorsed by the CHMP and the issue was considered 
resolved. 
Secondary endpoint: Major relapses 6 months after the end of the respective treatment 
Because the duration of follow-up "off treatment" was different between groups at month 28 (namely 6 
months for the azathioprine arm vs. 10 months for the rituximab arm), an additional analysis was 
carried out, focusing on the number of major relapses occurring in each group up to 6 months after the 
end of the respective treatment. The percentage of patients with a major relapse was 5.2% and 28.8% 
for rituximab (at week 24) and azathioprine arms (at week 28), respectively. The HR for rituximab 
versus azathioprine from a Cox-PH model was 0.19 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.66), p< 0.0007, and a little 
higher than the HR calculated in the primary endpoint (0.14 [95% CI: 0.04, 0.47], p< 0.0015). The 
difference is due to four additional relapses in the azathioprine arm after week 24. 
Ancillary analyses 
Additional analysis: BVAS analysis 
Mean BVAS remained low for patients in both treatment arms (Table 8). For patients in the rituximab 
arm, mean BVAS was 0.1 at Day 1 and 0.2 at Month 28; mean BVAS ranged from a low of 0.0 (Day 1, 
Month 21, and Month 24) to a high of 0.3 (Month 9), with the highest individual score of 9 reported at 
Month 28.  For patients in the azathioprine arm, mean BVAS was 0.2 at Day 1 and 0.0 at Month 28; 
mean BVAS ranged from a low of 0.0 (Months 6, 21, and 28) to a high of 0.7 (Month 18).  The highest 
individual score among patients in the azathioprine arm was 18, which occurred at Month 15.

At Day 15, no BVAS data were available for the Azathioprine arm. 
Additional endpoint: Immunological analysis 
CD19 counts decreased from Day 1 (median 38.5/mm3) to Day 15 (median 0/mm3) and remained low 
through Month 24. Median values had returned toward baseline by Month 28.  
For two of the patients in the rituximab arm who had major relapses by Month 28, CD19 counts were 
0/mm3 near the time of the major relapse.  A patient, who had a major relapse a few weeks before 
Month 24, the patient’s CD19 count was 29/mm3 at Month 18 and 0/mm3 at Month 28. 
Median IgA, IgG, and IgM values were comparable between treatment arms and changes from baseline 
were small over the course of the study. Where ADA was present prior to an infusion, it did not appear 
to interfere with rituximab pharmacodynamics (CD19 counts) when this data was available. Peripheral 
CD19 counts depleted as normal following rituximab infusions.

Subgroup analysis: 
Subgroup analyses by patients with or without detectable ANCAs at baseline were performed for the 
primary endpoint, the secondary endpoints of patients with minor relapse and dose and duration of 
corticosteroid treatment after the end of maintenance therapy, and for the additional endpoint of BVAS 
by visit and treatment. The number of patients in each subgroup was too small to draw conclusions. 
Analysis of long-term outcomes at 60 months 
A plenary session conference abstract on analysis of long term outcomes of the MAINRITSAN (Study 
ML22514) trial patients was submitted by the MAH. 
Methods: Data on survival, relapse, cancers, cardiovascular morbidity and other adverse events were 
ascertained prospectively and collected from physicians. All patients were analyzed according to 
randomization group. Quality-adjusted time-without-symptoms-and-toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis was 
computed, with the aim of better discerning the therapeutic impact and tradeoffs between treatment 
toxicity (severe adverse events, SAEs) and disease activity (relapse). 
Results: Data from 60 months of follow-up were available for 110 (96%) of the 115 randomized 
participants. For the RTX- and AZA-treated groups, respectively: 0 and 4 died; 60-month overall 
survival rates were 100% and 93.0% [95% CI 86.7-99.9%] (P=0.045); all-relapse-free survival rates 
were 57.9% [95% CI 46.4-72.2%] and 37.2% [95% CI 26.5-52.2%] (P=0.012); and major relapse-
free survival rates were 71.9% [95% CI 61.2-84.6%)] and 49.4% [95% CI 38.0-64.3%] (P=0.003). 
In contrast, no between-group differences were observed for survival without SAEs (P=0.95) and the 
cumulative GC dose (P=0.11) at 60 months. For RTX-treated patients, PR3-ANCA positivity or ANCA 
persistence 12 months after starting maintenance therapy were associated with higher major relapse 
rates. During the 60-month follow-up, RTX- and AZA-arm patients had similar amounts of time spent 
with SAEs (P=0.21), whereas the former, compared to the latter, spent 9.7 months less with major 
relapses (P<0.001) and 12.6 months more without relapse or toxicity (P<0.001). The threshold utility 
analysis at 60 months showed that the Q-TWiST period was significantly longer for RTX- than AZA-arm 
patients (55.2 vs. 47.95 months, respectively, P<0.001).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
No dose response study was submitted. The rituximab dose was chosen pragmatic based on previous 
clinical experiences of use of the drug within approved indications (induction therapy for AAV and 
rheumatoid arthritis). This approach was considered acceptable to the CHMP considering the rarity of 
the disease.

The MAH has provided one phase III study, ML22514 and a conference abstract describing 60 month 
follow-up data from the mentioned study to support the proposed new indication. The phase III study 
is a prospective, multi-centre, comparative, randomized, open-label study including 117 patients study 
comparing azathioprine versus rituximab in combination with low-dose corticosteroids for the 
maintenance treatment of GPA/MPA. The study design is considered acceptable. The 
inclusion/exclusion criteria clearly define a patient diagnosed with GPA, MPA, and limited renal forms 
(pauci-immune glomerulonephritis) with or without ANCA is based on established criteria, and the 
proposed new indication clearly reflects these criteria. 
Patients in remission were randomized 1:1 to maintenance treatment with rituximab or azathioprine 
and was stratified by recently diagnosed or recurrent disease. The rituximab arm were treated for 18 
months and the azathioprine arm were treated for 22 months. The reason for the chosen differences in 
duration of treatment is well argued by the MAH and is due to differences in pharmacodynamics 
between the study drug and comparator.  Corticosteroid treatment throughout the study was left to 
the investigator’s discretion, and it is noted, that each study subject in the rituximab arm received 100 
mg methylprednisolone before each rituximab infusion. 
Induction therapy followed standard of care in France with “older” immunosuppressants such as 
cyclophosphamide or methotrexate. No patients received monoclonal antibodies as the initial 
treatment. The number and proportion of subjects in each treatment group that were given MTX as 
induction treatment was presented to the CHMP, since patients being selected to receive induction with 
MTX probably has a limited or less severe disease. If there is an imbalance between the groups 
regarding these patients, it could have affected the study results. The MAH has provided sufficient data 
on patients receiving MTX as induction therapy. Only one patient in the AZA arm (1.7%) and no 
patients in the RTX arm received induction therapy with MTX, which in the CHMP’s opinion has no 
impact on the primary analyses. 
For azathioprine, the EULAR guideline recommends a dose of 2 mg/kg/day; it is recommended to 
continue remission-maintenance therapy for at least 24 months following induction of sustained 
remission and no recommendation to gradually taper the dose is given. In ML22514, azathioprine was 
started at 2mg/kg/day for 12 months, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/day for 6 months, and finally 1 
mg/kg/day for 4 months; treatment was discontinued after 22 months. Although it was noted that the 
major-relapse rate after azathioprine dose reduction was not higher than before dose reduction, the 
MAH was asked to discuss if the azathioprine dose could have been suboptimal and how this could 
affect the interpretation of the efficacy results from the study. The MAH responded, that the dosing 
schedule for the comparator, AZA, was selected based on previous experiences from clinical study and 
on the warning in the product label due to the increased risk of malignancy and other side effects of 
continuous treatment. Further, it was argued, that the occurrence of major relapse was similar before 
and after AZA tapering until the primary endpoint at Month 28. The issue was considered resolved by 
the CHMP. 
The objectives are clearly described. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of rituximab as 
maintenance therapy for patients in remission from ANCA-related systemic vasculitis after a first 
exacerbation or relapse. Clinically meaningful secondary objectives are also defined including 
comparison of tolerance to treatments. 
The primary endpoint is clearly defined, clinically relevant and fully acceptable in this setting. The 
secondary endpoints are overall acceptable.  
With regard to sample size, the power and alpha are as to be expected for a phase III study. With 
regard to statistics all randomized patients comprise the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population, and all

statistical testing is two-sided with 5% Type I error with 95% CI. The statistical methods proposed was 
endorsed by the CHMP. 
The CHMP noted that the baseline disease characteristics were not well balanced with respect to 
gender disease type, where more patients in the rituximab arm had GPA compared with the 
azathioprine arm and fewer had MPA. Further, more patients were ANCA positive in the azathioprine 
arm compared with the rituximab am.  
The MAH was asked to discuss if these differences were of importance with respect to the duration and 
prognosis of the GPA/MPA disease. The MAH provided elaborated and satisfactory discussions on the 
mentioned differences. With respect to GPA and MPA, it was argued, that due to the overlapping 
features (and symptoms), there is little clinical distinction between the two vasuclitides and they are 
considered to form part of the same disease spectrum. Subgroup analysis of patients with GPA showed 
fewer relapses by month 28 in favour of rituximab. Further, analysis of the baseline differences in 
gender between the two study arms did not appear to have influenced response to rituximab or 
prognosis of the disease. The issue was considered resolved by the CHMP. With regards to ANCA status 
at baseline, the majority of patients (63%) were ANCA positive at study entry (55% and 71% in the 
RTX and AZA arm, respectively). Subgroup analyses based on ANCA status were previously performed 
for the primary analysis of number of patients with a major relapse by Month 28, and no obvious 
relationship was demonstrated in either treatment arm, between the ANCA status at baseline or at the 
time of relapse and the occurrence of relapse. The MAH concluded that the baseline ANCA appeared to 
have no impact on the effect of rituximab in preventing relapse. This was endorsed by the CHMP. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study met its primary endpoint, showing both a statistically significant and clinically relevant 
difference in terms of risk of major relapse in advantage of rituximab at Month 28. Adjusting for the 
stratification factor using Cox PH modelling, rituximab reduced the risk of major relapse by 
approximately 86% relative to azathioprine (HR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.47, p=0.0015). Risk estimate 
of major relapses 6 months after the end of treatment in both arms were presented as a secondary 
endpoint (HR for rituximab versus azathioprine arms 0.19, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.66, p< 0.0007, and was 
due to four fewer events in the azathioprine arm). 
With regard to the secondary endpoint on the percentage of patients with detectable ANCAs, the 
baseline difference between the two groups clearly appears. In the rituximab arm, a tendency of 
decreasing detectable ANCAs is seen from baseline to Month 12. Then a stable period from Month 12 
to 18 is seen, followed by a slow increase up to Month 28. In the azathioprine arm, a more fluctuating 
course is observed. 
The secondary endpoint on incidence of minor relapse by Month 28, a small numeric, but statistically 
non-significant, difference between the two treatment arms was observed. 
As expected, a near-complete depletion of peripheral CD19 was observed following rituximab 
treatment. Two patients had major relapses despite complete CD19 depression near the time of 
relapse. Relapse of disease appears not to be related to presence of CD19+ B-cells, but data are too 
sparse for further and more safe conclusions. 
The secondary endpoint on cumulative corticosteroid dose and duration of treatment at Month 10 after 
end of maintenance treatment appears to be of limited value due to the differences in follow-up time, 
and since only post-treatment data was presented (10 months in the rituximab arm vs. 6 months in 
the azathioprine arm). The MAH subsequently provided data for the total cumulative corticosteroid 
dose which overall showed a lower value for the rituximab arm compared with the azathioprine arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/62482/2020  
Page 34/70 
 
 
 
Of additional analysis, no difference was observed between the two arms with respect to mean BVAS. 
Subgroup analyses were performed, but the number of patients in each subgroup was too small to 
draw conclusions. However, the MAH satisfactory complemented the subgroup analysis with additional 
data and discussion. 
Patients enrolled in the study ML22514 had achieved disease control after induction of remission with 
cyclophosphamide only. Indeed, the indication in the induction of remission therapy of granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis was not approved for Mabthera at the time when the 
study was conducted. However, the MAH proposed to extend the indication in maintenance treatment 
to patients who received Mabthera for the induction of remission. The rituximab dosing regimen in 
patients who received Mabthera for the induction of remission was chosen pragmatically based on 
previous clinical experiences of use of the drug within approved indications. This approach was 
considered acceptable to the CHMP considering the rarity of the disease. 
As recommended in the pre-submission meeting, data on the analysis of long-term outcomes at 60 
months were submitted in form of a plenary session conference abstract. The major relapse-free 
survival rates at 60 months after initiation of maintenance treatment were 71.9% (95% CI 61.2-
84.6%) and 49.4% (95% CI 38.0-64.3%), P=0.003 for the rituximab arm and azathioprine arm 
respectively. The conclusion was that the long-term analysis showed that, despite late relapses after 
the 28-month initial follow-up period, maintenance therapy with rituximab remained significantly 
superior to azathioprine to maintain remission at 60 months and was associated with better survival. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study ML22514 comparing rituximab to azathioprine is overall a well-designed and well-conducted 
phase III study demonstrating the effect of reducing relapse of AAV disease, showing both a 
statistically significant and clinically relevant difference in terms of time to first major relapse in 
advantage of rituximab. The results from secondary endpoints and additional endpoints seem 
consistent with the primary endpoint. 
The CHMP considered that the clinical efficacy satisfactorily supports the new indication. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety evidence for the use of rituximab as maintenance therapy in patients with GPA/MPA after 
achieving remission, was primarily obtained from the phase III trial (Study ML22514) with 115 
patients (57 of them exposed to rituximab). Data obtained from these patients was recorded regularly 
on e-CRFs at least every 3 months, until the Month 28 visit. The investigators continuously kept the 
study coordinators informed of the health status and progress of the patients. For subjects who were 
lost to follow-up, the e-CRF was to be completed until the last visit performed. 
Additional supportive safety evidence were included from an interim report available for a phase IV, 
open-label, observational study (Study WA27893, RaVeR), which is still ongoing, as well as from 
literature and post marketing safety data from the Applicant’s safety database. 
Patient exposure 
Rituximab and azathioprine exposure: 
In the safety population there were 115 patients who received at least one dose of any study drug; 57 
patients received rituximab and 58 patients received azathioprine. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/62482/2020  
Page 35/70 
 
 
 
The median cumulative dose of rituximab was 2500 mg (range: 500 mg to 2500 mg), suggesting that 
most patients received the full set of five 500-mg doses over the course of the study (Table 12).   
The median cumulative dose of azathioprine was 71,625 mg (range: 6,000 to 122,350 mg).  Because 
dosing was done on a mg/kg basis that decreased stepwise (2 mg/kg/day for Months 1 to 12, 1.5 
mg/kg/day for Months 12 to 18, and 1.0 mg/kg/day for Months 18 to 22), daily doses of azathioprine 
varied among patients and over the course of the study. 
Table 12  Summary of Extent of Exposure to Rituximab and Azathioprine During 
Maintenance Period by Trial Treatment (Safety) 
Corticosteroid exposure: 
Corticosteroid dosing was left to the investigator’s discretion during the study; however, the protocol 
recommended that doses be tapered and maintained at a low dose through Month 18.  The median 
cumulative doses of corticosteroid over time were similar between treatment arms (see table below).

*AEs reported as infusion reactions on exposure CRF were compared against the Roche AEGT basket, and only 
those matching Roche's AEGT basket and occurring on the visit day or the next day were retained and 
summarized.                                                
Percentages are based on N.                                                                                                             
AEs by intensity 
AEs by intensity from the ML22514 study was presented detailed in tabular. In summary, in both arms, 
the majority of patients experienced adverse events that were mild (35% rituximab vs. 16% 
azathioprine) or moderate (40% vs. 47%) in intensity. However, more patients on azathioprine (29%) 
compared with rituximab (14%) experienced severe events. In the rituximab arm, severe events were 
most frequently reported in the SOC of Infections and infestations (5% rituximab vs. 3% azathioprine) 
whereas General disorders and administration site conditions were more common in the azathioprine 
arm (2% vs. 7%, respectively). Infections were predominantly mild or moderate in intensity. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Three patients (2.6%), all in the azathioprine arm, died during the study (1 event occurred after Month 
28) (Table 17). The narratives for these patients were provided in details. In summary: 
•  1 patient enrolled in the study with a new diagnosis of MPA and was randomized to receive 
azathioprine. The patient had a major relapse at study day 305 and withdrew from the study 
five days later. The patient had a fatal event of ischemic colitis on Study Day 855. Relatedness 
of this event to study drug was not provided. 
•  1 patient enrolled in the study with a new diagnosis of GPA and was randomized to receive 
azathioprine. The patient had minor relapses on study days 512 and 588. The patient withdrew 
from the study during month 18 due to the adverse event of metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.  
The patient died at home (no cause of death provided) on study day 726. Relatedness of this 
event to study drug was not provided.

Infections 
The overall incidence of infections was lower in the rituximab arm compared to the azathioprine arm 
(53% vs 57%); infections were predominantly mild to moderate in intensity. In the rituximab arm, the 
most commonly reported events were upper respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, urinary tract 
infection and herpes zoster. 
The incidence of serious infections was similar between the two treatment arms (approx. 12%); the 
most commonly reported serious infection in the rituximab arm was bronchitis.  One patient in the 
azathioprine arm died due to an infection (septic shock) A total of three opportunistic infections were 
reported in Study ML22514 (all serious); two patients in rituximab arm experienced one event each of 
severe oesophageal candidiasis and moderate pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia; and one patient in

azathioprine arm experienced moderate atypical mycobacterial pneumonia. One patient in the 
rituximab arm experienced tuberculosis. 
Infusion related reactions (IRR)

Pregnancy 
Three patients in the rituximab arm became pregnant during the study: 
•  1 patient was reported to be 6.5 months pregnant on Day 299, and the patient withdrew from 
the study on the same day. The patient, who enrolled with a new diagnosis of GPA, received 
her last dose of rituximab prior to the event at Study Day 173, approximately 4 months prior 
to the pregnancy being reported. 
•  1 patient had an early spontaneous abortion (Week 3) on Study Day 505 (approximately 
Month 16).  The patient, who enrolled with a new diagnosis of GPA, received her last dose of 
rituximab prior to the event at Month 12.  The patient completed the study. 
•  1 patient had a serious adverse event of fetal death on Study Day 181. The patient, who 
enrolled with a new diagnosis of GPA, received her last dose of rituximab prior to the event at 
Study Day 15. The event was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to rituximab. The 
patient completed the study. 
The CHMP noted that two cases of abortion/foetal death was reported in the rituximab arm. Causality 
cannot be excluded albeit it appears quite unlikely. Indeed, AAV disease may per se be a risk factor of 
abortion/foetal death. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory data were collected locally and were not analyzed or presented in the CSR for Study 
ML22514.

Safety in special populations 
The MAH argued that it was not meaningful to perform any subgroup analysis in special populations 
due to a very small number of patients within each subgroup. This approach was endorsed by the 
CHMP.

Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing exposure 
Since the IBD (26 November 1997) until 30 September 2016 (data lock point for exposure calculation 
of the most recent Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report), approximately 5,378,160 patient-market 
exposures have been estimated for rituximab. The primary market research data prior to 2009 and the 
available syndicated market research data (i.e., the US claims data) do not contain sufficient 
information for exact calculation of exposure of AAV patients to rituximab.

Post-marketing safety data from the MAH 
Post-marketing safety data reported in the MAH global safety database and the literature, aiming to 
investigate the safety profile of rituximab maintenance therapy in patients with GPA/MPA, in support of 
the planned application were reviewed and summarized (Report No: 1081144). 
The results from the safety database analysis, despite potential methodological limitations, showed 
consistency with the results from Study ML22514, and with the well-established safety profile of the 
approved GPA/MPA and RA indications. The long-term exposure data available on rituximab in RA and 
GPA/MPA clinical trial patients showed no new safety signals or increased reporting rates of AEs with 
increasing duration of exposure or courses of treatment. 
The review of the published literature on rituximab maintenance therapy reported overall a satisfactory 
safety profile, and a clear interest could be seen in the literature for the use of rituximab in the 
maintenance indication. Most of the relevant references investigated specific concerns related to the 
safety profile of rituximab in GPA/MPA maintenance, such as infections, low Ig levels, and rituximab 
long term exposure. 
Study WA27893 (RaVeR) 
Study WA27893 is a Phase IV, open-label, observational study designed to examine the long-term 
safety profile of rituximab treatment in patients with GPA or MPA in a prospective observational 
setting, outside of a controlled clinical trial. 
Patients received either fixed doses or body surface area (BSA)-based doses of rituximab at the 
discretion of the investigator. One hundred patients were enrolled in this study, including 3 patients 
who were not included in the safety population because their safety data could not be verified. All 97 
patients in the safety population received at least one course of rituximab, and 68 patients received 
more than one course. As of the data cut-off date of the interim report, the median duration on study 
was 2.4 years (range: 0.05 to 3.2 years).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The majority of patients experienced an AE, however the total number of patients with one or more 
related AE was lower in the rituximab arm compared with the azathioprine arm. The absolute total 
number of related events were similar between the two groups. 
The most common AEs are related to infections, general disorders and administration site condition, 
gastrointestinal disorders and musculoskeletal/connective tissue disorders. A majority of the patients 
had AEs that were mild or moderate in intensity, and more patients on azathioprine compared with 
rituximab experienced severe events. 
Overall, the incidence of patients any SAE was lower in the rituximab group, but the total number of 
patients with any related SAE were comparable with the azathioprine treated patients. The most 
frequent reported SAE was infections/infestations, which was similar between the two groups (approx. 
12%). However, the number of total events was a little higher in the rituximab arm compared with the 
azathioprine arm (14 vs. 8). The reported SAE reflects the known safety profile of rituximab.  
There were 3 patients who died in the AZA arm vs. 0 in the RTX arm. No deaths were related to 
treatment with rituximab.  
Two patients in the rituximab arm discontinued from study treatment due to an AE vs. 9 in the 
azathioprine arm which indicates better tolerability in favour of rituximab. 
Overall, the incidence of infections was comparable between the two arms.  Opportunistic infections 
(candidiasis, pneumocystis jirovecii) and tuberculosis were reported in the rituximab group. The most 
frequent reported SAE was infections/infestations, and the incidence was identical in the two groups. 
However, the number of total events was a little higher in the rituximab arm. (14 vs. 8). The second 
most common SAE was General Disorders and Administration Site Condition was comparable between 
the two groups (total numbers of patients 12.3% vs. 10.3%, total numbers of events 8 vs. 6). The 
reported SAE reflects the known safety profile of rituximab. 
Fewer gastrointestinal AEs were seen in the rituximab group in terms of no. of patients and number of 
events. It is noted, that markedly fewer AEs related to blood and lymphatic system appeared among 
the RTX treated patients. 
The incidence of IRR symptoms was highest during the first infusion and decreased with subsequent 
infusions. The IRRs were mild or moderate and no patients withdrew from the study due to IRR. The 
incidence of IRR is as expected for this type of drug. 
Two cases of abortion/fetal death was reported in the rituximab arm. Causality cannot be excluded 
albeit it appears unlikely. AAV disease may per se be a risk factor of abortion/fetal death. 
Two patients in the rituximab arm discontinued the study treatment due to AEs compared with 9 
patients in the azathioprine arm. The events that lead to discontinuation in the rituximab arm was 
carpal tunnel syndrome and pregnancy which was deemed unrelated by the investigator 
No new or unexpected safety findings were identified in the post-marketing exposure- and safety data, 
but the conclusion should be interpreted with caution due to methodological limitations. Overall, the 
presentation of the post-marketing exposure and safety data was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
In study WA27893 (RaVeR), at cut-off, a total of 48 patients (49.5%) experienced at least one AE, and 
33 patients (34.0%) had SAE. Six patients died during the study; none of these events were 
considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment. Two patients were diagnosed with 
Assessment report

Page 49/70 
 
 
 
 
malignancy, which also was deemed unrelated to the treatment by the investigator. The number of 
patients with serious infections was 11 (11.3%). Overall, the interim analysis showed no unexpected 
safety findings and is consistent with the short-term data and the known safety profile in the RA 
population.  
However, there is missing information on the long term use in GPA/MPA patients. This was added in 
the safety concerns in the RMP and the MAH should provide additional information to further address 
this concern. See section 2.6. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, maintenance treatment with rituximab over 18 months is well-tolerated. The observed safety 
profile is as expected and in line with the known safety profile of rituximab used in other patient 
population with autoimmune and lympho-proliferative diseases. Discontinuation rate due to AEs was 
generally low.  
In conclusion, there are no major concerns with regard to the safety profile of rituximab used as 
maintenance therapy. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 17.0 could be acceptable if the applicant 
implements the changes to the RMP to update the approved T.II/144 RMP version 16.1 related 
changes and delete the previous included changes of the ongoing  to variation T. II 150. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 17.1 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
to implement a terminology change in Annex II.D. 
The “induction of remission in adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
(Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)” was already approved for Mabthera. With this 
new indication in the “maintenance of treatment in adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)”, the wording of the indication 
was modified to “treatment of adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
(Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)”: 
MabThera, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in treatment 
of adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and 
microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).

The other parts of the SmPC present the data in the “induction of remission” and the “maintenance 
treatment”. Please refer to the approved PI. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and 
do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for MabThera is, in combination with glucocorticoids, the maintenance 
treatment of adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and 
microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) – also known as Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) – and 
microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are both associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) 
and are therefore referred to collectively as ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). The clinical features of 
GPA and MPA largely overlap, as necrotizing vasculitis may occur in the same organs. In GPA, crusting 
granulomata in the ear, nose and throat area and alveolar bleeding are the most prominent feature, 
and segmental, necrotizing glomerulonephritis may occur in about 50% of the cases. In MPA, 
glomerulonephritis is the most prominent feature present in virtual all patients, whereas the 
respiratory tract may be spared. In both GPA and MPA, vasculitis may be extended to other organs like 
the skin, nervous system, heart and gastrointestinal (GI) tract (mesenterium). CNS involvement is 
relatively rare for both disorders. Systemic features (fever, arthritis) are more common in MPA. The 
distinction between both entities is made by histology. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Historically, induction therapy with cyclophosphamide (CYC) was used. CYC is associated with 
significant toxicity, such as uro-toxicity (haemorrhagic cystitis, bladder cancer), cardio-toxicity, 
malignancies (lymphoma, thyroid cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer), lymphopenia and neutropenia, 
serious and opportunistic infections, thrombocytopenia and reduced fertility. Because of its toxicity, its 
use is limited to short-term induction therapy of severe flares, followed by maintenance therapy with 
other, in general better-tolerated immune-suppressant agents, like AZA (azathioprine), MFM 
(mycophenolate mofetil) or MTX (methotrexate). Mild-isolated cases of GPA granulomata may be 
treated with MTX alone. 
In the European Union (EU), rituximab intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with glucocorticoids, 
was approved on 22 April 2013 for the induction of remission in adult patients with severe, active GPA 
and MPA. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current submission supporting the approval of Mabthera for maintenance treatment of patients 
with GPA and MPA who are in remission, is based on the results from one investigator sponsored 
pivotal Phase III trial (Study ML22514/MAINRITSAN I), which evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/62482/2020  
Page 67/70 
 
 
 
rituximab versus azathioprine for the prevention of disease relapse. The study was a therapeutic, 
prospective, Phase III, multi-centre, comparative, randomized, open-label study comparing 
azathioprine versus rituximab in combination with low-dose corticosteroids for the maintenance 
treatment of GPA/MPA. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study ML22514 showed both a statistically significant and clinically relevant difference in terms of time 
to first major relapse in advantage of rituximab at Month 28. Adjusting for the stratification factor 
using Cox PH modelling, rituximab reduced the risk of major relapse by approximately 86% relative to 
azathioprine (HR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.47, p=0.0015). The results from secondary endpoints and 
additional endpoints are all consistent with the primary endpoint. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were not well balanced with respect to gender, 
distribution of GPA and MPA between the treatment arms and occurrence of ANCA. With respect to GPA 
and MPA, there is little clinical distinction between the two vasuclitides due to the overlapping features 
(and symptoms) and they are considered to form part of the same disease spectrum. Further, analysis 
of the baseline differences in gender between the two study arms did not appear to have influenced 
response to rituximab or prognosis of the disease. With regards to ANCA, the baseline ANCA appeared 
to have no impact on the effect of rituximab in preventing relapse. In conclusion, those uncertainties 
were adequately addressed by the MAH and considered solved by the CHMP. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common AEs were related to infections, general disorders and administration site condition, 
gastrointestinal disorders and musculoskeletal/connective tissue disorders. A majority of the patients 
had AEs that were classified as mild or moderate in intensity, and more patients on azathioprine 
compared with rituximab experienced severe events, which is reassuring in view of rituximab. 
The incidence of infusion related reactions (IRR) were as expected for this type of drug, and symptoms 
were higher after the first infusion and decreased with subsequent infusions. Two patients treated with 
rituximab discontinued the treatment due to carpal tunnel syndrome and pregnancy. 
No new or unexpected safety findings were identified in the post-marketing exposure- and safety data. 
However, conclusions on the post-marketing exposure- and safety data should be interpreted with 
caution due to methodological limitations. Overall, the presentation of the post-marketing exposure 
and safety data was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no major uncertainties or concerns with regard to the safety profile of rituximab in the 
proposed patient population. The safety profile of rituximab is as expected. However, there is missing 
information on the long term use in GPA/MPA patients. This was added in the safety concerns in the 
RMP and the MAH should provide additional information to further address this concern. See section 
2.6.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Study ML55214 comparing rituximab to azathioprine is a well-designed and well-conducted phase III 
study, demonstrating value of rituximab used as maintenance treatment for AAV compared with 
azathioprine. The risk of major relapse of AAV was reduced by approximately 86% 28 months after 
initiation of maintenance treatment with rituximab as compared to azathioprine. Analysis of long-term 
outcomes at 60 months seemed to substantiate the superior efficacy of rituximab. The rituximab 
dosing regimen in patients who received Mabthera for the induction of remission was chosen 
pragmatically based on previous clinical experiences of use of the drug within approved indications. 
This approach was considered acceptable to the CHMP considering the rarity of the disease. 
The observed safety profile of rituximab in this setting is favourable compared with azathioprine, and is 
in line with the known safety profile of rituximab used in other autoimmune disease populations (e.g. 
rheumatoid arthritis).  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The “induction of remission in adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
(Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)” was already approved for Mabthera. With this 
new indication in the “maintenance of treatment in adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)”, the wording of the indication 
was modified to “treatment of adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
(Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)”: 
MabThera, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in treatment 
of adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and 
microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit risk balance of Mabthera in the treatment of adult patients with severe, active 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is positive.

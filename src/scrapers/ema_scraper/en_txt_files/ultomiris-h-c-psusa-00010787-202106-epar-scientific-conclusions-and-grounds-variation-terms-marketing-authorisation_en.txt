Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ravulizumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP  are as follows:  
In view of available data on urticaria from spontaneous reports including in  some cases with  a close 
temporal relationship, a positive re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC 
considers a causal relationship between ravulizumab and urticaria is established. The PRAC concluded 
that  the product information of products containing  ravulizumab should be amended accordingly. 
 The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the  scientific conclusions for ravulizumab the CHMP  is of the  opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the  medicinal product(s) containing  ravulizumab is unchanged subject to  the proposed 
changes to  the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

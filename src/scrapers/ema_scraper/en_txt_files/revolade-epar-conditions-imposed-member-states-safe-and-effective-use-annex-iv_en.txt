CONDITIONS  OR  RESTRICTIONS  WITH  REGARD  TO  THE  SAFE  AND  EFFECTIVE  USE  OF 
MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES 
The Member States must ensure that all conditions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal products described below are implemented: 
The MAH shall agree the details of an educational programme with the National Competent 
Authorities and must implement such programme nationally to ensure that, prior to prescribing, all 
physicians are provided with a healthcare professional information pack containing the following: 
 
 
Educational material 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet and Labelling 
 Key elements to be included in the educational material 
Hepatotoxicity 
•  Educate  patients  about  the  potential  for  hepatic  enzyme  elevations,  importance  of  monthly 
laboratory  monitoring  of  ALT  and  AST,  as  well  as  the  signs  and  symptoms  associated  with  liver 
injury (e.g. jaundice). 
• Measure serum ALT, AST and bilirubin prior to initiation of Revolade, every 2 weeks during the 
dose adjustment phase and monthly following establishment of a stable dose. 
• Discontinue Revolade if ALT levels increase (≥ 3X the upper limit of normal [ULN]) and are: 
- progressive, or 
- persistent for > 4 weeks, or 
- accompanied by increased direct bilirubin, or 
- accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury or evidence for hepatic decompensation. 
• Exercise caution when administering eltrombopag  to patients with hepatic disease. Use a lower 
starting dose of eltrombopag and monitor closely when administering eltrombopag to patients with 
hepatic impairment.. 
Thromboembolic events 
• Eltrombopag  should  not  be  used  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  (Child  Pugh  score  ≥  5) 
unless  the  expected  benefit  outweighs  the  identified  risk  of  portal  venous  thrombosis.  If  use  of 
eltrombopag is deemed necessary, the starting dose must be 25mg once daily. 
•  Educate  patients  about  the  potential  for  thromboembolic  events  (TEE)  in  patients  with  chronic 
ITP  and  those  known  risk  factors  for  thromboembolic  events  (e.g.,  Factor  V  Leiden,  ATIII 
deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome). 
• Educate patients about chronic liver disease and the risk of thromboembolic events. 
• In patients with chronic liver disease treated with eltrombopag there was an association between 
TEE and platelet counts ≥ 200,000/µl. 
•  A  dose  reduction  is  recommended  for  ITP  patients  with  platelet  counts  between  150,000-
250,000/μl. 
•  Revolade  should  be  interrupted  if  platelet  counts  increase  to  >  250,000/μl.  Once  the  platelet 
count is < 100,000/μl, reinitiate therapy at a reduced daily dose. 
Posology 
• Educate patients on the appropriate administration of Revolade (e.g. titration of Revolade, food-
drug interaction, dose recommendations for special populations [e.g. east Asians]). 
•  Awareness  to  prescribers  of  the  labelled  indication  and  warnings  associated  with  non-indicated 
populations  (e.g.  not  recommended  for  use  in  children,  pregnant  or  lactating  females,  other  off 
label uses). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Food Interactions 
• Educate patients about the potential food-drug interaction (i.e. chelation with polyvalent cations 
such  as  iron,  calcium,  magnesium,  aluminium,  selenium  and  zinc).  Antacids,  dairy  products  and 
other products containing polyvalent cations, such as mineral supplements, must be administered 
at  least  four  hours  apart  from  Revolade  dosing  to  avoid  significant  reduction  in  Revolade 
absorption due to chelation. 
• Assist patient in developing a  plan to administer Revolade at  a time each  day that fits  into the 
patient’s own daily schedule. 
Reoccurrence of Thrombocytopenia 
•  Educate  patients  about  the  potential  risk  of  bleeding  after  treatment  has  stopped  (include 
incidence  in  clinical  trials  and  likelihood  of  reoccurrence  of  thrombocytopenia  after  cessation  of 
treatment). 
• Following discontinuation of Revolade, platelet counts return to baseline levels within 2 weeks in 
the majority of patients, which increase the bleeding risk and in some cases may lead to bleeding. 
• Monitor platelet count weekly for 4 weeks following discontinuation of Revolade. 
Increased Bone Marrow Reticulin Fibres 
• Educate patients about the potential for bone marrow reticulin fibre formation. 
•  Background  information  on  reticulin  in  the  bone  marrow  (i.e.  background  rates  of  reticulin  in 
bone  marrow  in  ITP  patients  and  the  observed  incidence  and  potential  mechanism  of  action  of 
reticulin deposition in response to Revolade). 
• Prior to initiation of Revolade, examine the peripheral blood smear closely to establish a baseline 
level of cellular morphologic abnormalities. 
•  Following  identification  of  a  stable  dose  of  Revolade,  perform  complete  blood  count  (CBC)  with 
white blood cell count (WBC) differential monthly. 
•  If  immature  or  dysplastic  cells  are  observed,  examine  peripheral  blood  smears  for  new  or 
worsening  morphological  abnormalities  (e.g.,  teardrop  and  nucleated  red  blood  cells,  immature 
white blood cells) or cytopenia(s). 
•  If  the  patient  develops  new  or  worsening  morphological  abnormalities  or  cytopenia(s), 
discontinue  treatment  with  Revolade  and  consider  a  bone  marrow  biopsy,  including  staining  for 
fibrosis. 
Haematological malignancies 
•  The  diagnosis  of  ITP  in  adults  and  elderly  patients  should  have  been  confirmed  by  excluding 
other clinical entities with thrombocytopenia. Consideration should be given to performing a bone 
marrow aspirate and biopsy over the course of the disease and treatment, particularly in patients 
over 60 years of age, those with systemic symptoms or abnormal signs. 
•  Educate  patients  about  the  theoretical  risk  of  haematological  malignancies  with  thrombopoietin 
receptor agonists. 
•  Importance  of  not  using  Revolade  outside  the  context  of  its  license  unless  in  a  clinical  trial 
setting. 
Potential for Off-label Use 
•  The  risk-benefit  for  the  treatment  of  thrombocytopenia  in  non  ITP  patient  populations  has  not 
been established. 
• The risk-benefit of Revolade in paediatric ITP has not been established.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Adolescent obesity and the need for more treatment options 
The prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents has been increasing steadily during the past 
decades and has reached alarming proportions. It is expected that more than 250 million children and 
adolescents worldwide will be living with obesity by 2030.  
More than 70% of children suffering from obesity before puberty will also suffer from obesity as adults. 
Childhood obesity increases the risk of an earlier development of obesity-related comorbidities during 
adulthood. These comorbidities, as in the adult population, are associated with a wide range of severe 
health-related and psychosocial consequences, including a higher risk of disability in adulthood and 
premature death. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
Adolescents (≥12 years) 
Wegovy is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight 
management in adolescents ages 12 years and above with  
• 
• 
obesity* and 
body weight above 60 kg 
Treatment with Wegovy should be discontinued and re-evaluated if adolescent patients have not 
reduced their BMI by at least 5% after 12 weeks on the 2.4 mg or maximum tolerated dose. 
*Obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile) as defined on sex- and age-specific BMI growth charts (CDC.gov) (see 
Table 1).

Management 
Current international treatment guidelines for childhood obesity suggest community/environment-
based prevention, behaviour-oriented, and family-centred lifestyle modification as first-line treatment 
and standard of care, to help patients adopt healthier eating habits, increase physical activity and 
decrease sedentary time. 
Bariatric surgery is primarily restricted to adolescents with unsuccessful weight loss and comorbidities 
after implementing lifestyle modifications and/or pharmacotherapy. There remains a treatment gap for 
children and adolescents who have failed lifestyle modifications but do not meet the criteria for 
bariatric surgery. As in adults, most children and adolescents with obesity, especially those with severe 
obesity, struggle to achieve and maintain weight loss. 
Currently, there is an unmet medical need for safer, more effective therapeutic options for the 
treatment of obesity in children and adolescents. 
Therefore, pharmacotherapy may serve as a valuable adjunct to lifestyle modification for children and 
adolescents with obesity or overweight. Pharmacotherapy has the potential to help this population to 
achieve and to sustain clinically relevant weight loss, as well as to improve or prevent comorbid 
conditions and facilitate a healthier lifestyle. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Semaglutide subcutaneous (s.c.) 2.4 mg once weekly (Wegovy) has been approved as an adjunct to a 
reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management, including weight loss and 
weight maintenance in adults with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) and at 
least one weight-related comorbidity. It was initially approved in the US (June 2021) and hereafter in 
the UK (September 2021), Canada (November 2021), EU (January 2022), Switzerland (February 2022) 
and India (April 2022). 
The initial marketing authorisation application was based on 4 phase 3a trials (STEP 1–4), 1 phase 2 
dose-finding trial and 3 clinical pharmacology trials. These trials demonstrated that the balance 
between the benefits and risks of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once weekly (hereafter referred to as 
semaglutide 2.4 mg) was favourable when the magnitude and range of benefits, the manageable and 
well-characterised risks, the substantial and increasing burden of obesity and the unmet medical need 
was taken into account. 
The 4 phase 3a trials in the original application were conducted worldwide. All 4 trials were 68-week 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo in adult subjects with obesity or overweight and at least one 
weight-related comorbidity (including type 2 diabetes [T2D] in STEP 2). A total of 4585 subjects were 
enrolled and randomised in these 4 trials, and all trials showed the superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg 
compared to placebo. 
With the increasing prevalence of adolescents living with obesity, there is a need for effective and safe 
pharmacotherapy for weight management in the adolescent population. To address this, Trial NN9536-
4451 (hereafter referred to as STEP Teens) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly as an adjunct to calorie-reduced diet and increased physical activity 
in adolescents (age 12 to <18 years). This trial forms the basis of this label update. 
9/97 
 
 
 
 
Rationale for the proposed label update 
This variation application aims at extending the current Wegovy label with results from STEP Teens 
demonstrating the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg in an adolescent population (ages 12 to 
<18 years) with obesity or with overweight and at least one weight-related comorbidity.  
Overview of included trials 
An overview of details for the trial included in this variation application is available in the table below. 
The trial included in this variation application followed accepted industry and regulatory requirements 
for developing weight management products and were conducted according to ICH Good Clinical 
Practice. 
Table  Overview of completed phase 3a trial included in the variation application

Trial 4451 (STEP Teens) 
N=201 
68-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
Adolescent population  
(ages 12 to <18 years) 
trial investigating the effect and safety of semaglutide 
2.4 mg once weekly in adolescents with obesity (BMI 
corresponding to ≥95th percentile*) or with overweight

one weight-related comorbidity. 
*on gender and age-specific growth charts (CDC.gov). 
•  Body mass index (BMI) 85th and 95th percentiles on gender and age-specific growth charts 
(CDC.gov) 
These adolescents with overweight or obesity represent a clinically relevant population for 
pharmacotherapeutic weight management as they are at significant risk for weight-related 
comorbidities and have increased long-term mortality. 
Impact of COVID-19 
Although restrictions due to COVID-19 led to some changes in trial conduct, subject safety and trial 
integrity were maintained in the trial. The primary impact of COVID-19 was on visit attendance; 
however, both treatment groups were impacted comparably. Five subjects withdrew from the study, 
primarily due to personal or unstated reasons. Overall, treatment and trial completion were at a high 
level 89.6% and 97.5%, respectively.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The development programme 
The global clinical development programme for semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg for weight management, 
forming the basis for the initial application, comprised of 8 completed clinical trials: 
• 
• 
• 
clinical pharmacology trials (of which two bioequivalence trials) 
1 phase 2 dose-finding trial 
4 phase 3a therapeutic confirmatory trials (referred to as the STEP 1-4 trials) 
10/97 
 
 
 
Compliance with CHMP guidance 
Compliance with CHMP guidelines is discussed in the respective paragraphs below; no issues were 
identified. 
Paediatric Investigation Plan 
A Paediatric Investigation Plan has been agreed upon with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO).  
Indication targeted by the PIP: Treatment of obesity. 
Subset of the paediatric population concerned by the paediatric development: from 6 years to less than 
18 years of age. 
The PIP involves four clinical studies: 
Study 1 (NN9536-4451) is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-centre trial to evaluate 
the tolerability, safety and efficacy on weight management of semaglutide once-weekly versus placebo 
as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, in adolescents (aged 12 to less 
than 18 years) with overweight or obesity. Completed. 
Study 2 (NN9536-4512) is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the 
tolerability, safety and efficacy on weight management of semaglutide once-weekly versus placebo as 
an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in children (aged 6 to less than 12 
years) with obesity. Planned. 
Study 3 involves population PK modelling analysis to support dose selection in the adolescent 
population (12 to < 18 years), and to support dose selection in a subsequent trial in children (6 to < 
12 years) with obesity. Completed.  
Study 4 involves population PK modelling analysis to support dose selection in children (6 to < 12 
years). Planned. 
Date of completion of the paediatric investigation plan: June 2027. 
A waiver was granted for the paediatric population from birth to less than 6 years of age. 
Scientific advice 
No Scientific Advice was requested for the current application. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
GCP 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
11/97 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.  Quality 
Dose 
The maintenance dose of semaglutide 2.4 mg once-weekly is reached by starting with a dose of 0.25 
mg. To reduce the likelihood of gastrointestinal symptoms, the dose should be escalated over a 16-
week period to a maintenance dose: 
The dose should be increased until 2.4 mg (maintenance dose) or maximum tolerated dose has been 
reached. Weekly doses higher than 2.4 mg are not recommended. No dose adjustment is required for 
adolescents ages 12 years and above. 
To cover this range of doses, the following products are approved: 
•  Wegovy 0.25 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen, 0.5 ml 
•  Wegovy 0.5 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen, 0.5 ml 
•  Wegovy 1 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen, 0.5 ml 
•  Wegovy 1.7 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen, 0.75 ml 
•  Wegovy 2.4 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen, 0.75 ml 
•  Wegovy 0.25 mg FlexTouch solution for injection in pre-filled pen, 1.5 ml per pen (4 doses) 
•  Wegovy 0.5 mg FlexTouch solution for injection in pre-filled pen, 1.5 ml per pen (4 doses) 
•  Wegovy 1 mg FlexTouch solution for injection in pre-filled pen, 3 ml per pen (4 doses) 
•  Wegovy 1.7 mg FlexTouch solution for injection in pre-filled pen, 3 ml per pen (4 doses)

2.2.1.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Excipients 
No direct safety issues are foreseen with regard to the excipients disodium phosphate, dihydrate, 
sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), water 
for injections, and phenol.  
Propylene glycol is present in the 3 ml FlexTouch pen. The thresholds mentioned in 
EMA/CHMP/302620/2017 Rev. 1* (Annex to the European Commission guideline on ‘Excipients in the 
13/97 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use’ (SANTE-2017-11668)) are 1 
mg/kg/day and higher. Therefore, propylene glycol is not considered an issue for children aged 12 
years and older and no warning is necessary in the product information.   
Dosing 
The foreseen doses and injection volumes seem acceptable for use of the product in children from 12 - 
18 years (see also Clinical part below). 
Other relevant aspects  
Container Closure System 
Editorial changes to the wording related to the user group are made. No actual changes to the 
container closure system are made. 
Regional Information   
Notified body opinion has been updated with the evaluation of the revised human factor engineering 
reports. The notified body concludes that “the function of the device is identical to the assessed single 
dose pen injector for semaglutide in the notified body Opinion Review 713201094; some documents 
have been updated regarding the revised population group. In the updated notified body Opinion 
report 713260955 it has been assessed that the revised documents also show compliance to the 
relevant general safety and performance requirements (GSPRs).” 
As the notified body has concluded that the submitted changes are in compliance with the relevant 
GSPRs, a further quality review is not required. 
2.2.2.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Based on the review of the data provided, the application is considered approvable from the quality 
point of view. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant has justified that semaglutide is exempt from an environmental risk assessment by its 
protein nature, which is agreed. As there is no expected environmental exposure and because there is 
no concern that semaglutide (a recombinant protein) is persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic, a Phase 
II assessment is not necessary and environmental studies with semaglutide are not required. The 
logKow of semaglutide will be lower than the cut-off value of 4.5. The results of Phase I assessment 
yielded a PECsw of 0.002 µg/L, which is below the limit triggering Phase II. The use of semaglutide in 
humans will not result in a risk to environmental organisms. 
2.3.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A Phase II environmental risk assessment is not required. The updated data submitted in this 
application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of 
semaglutide. 
14/97 
 
 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects

Adolescent population  
(ages 12 to <18 years)  
trial investigating effect and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg

corresponding to ≥95th percentile*) or with overweight 
(BMI corresponding to ≥85th percentile*) and at least one 
weight-related comorbidity.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Population PK and exposure-response analyses of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once weekly for weight 
management in adolescents were presented. The meta-analyses were based on data from 2 trials: 
STEP TEENS (aged 12 to <18 years; NN9536-4451) and STEP 1 (aged ≥18 years; NN9536-4373). The 
baseline characteristics of the paediatric population are provided in Table. Sparse PK samples were 
collected in both studies. In STEP TEENS, sampling was done in Weeks 8,16, 28,36, 52, and 68. 
The STEP 1 trial, with adult patients, has been previously submitted and assessed in the initial 
application for Wegovy, solution for injection in pre-filled pen, for weight management,  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005422/0000. In this initial application, population pharmacokinetic analyses and exposure-
response analyses using data from the STEP 1 (N=1306; semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg) and STEP 2 
(N=403; semaglutide s.c. 1.0mg, N= 404;semaglutide 2.4mg)  trials were presented. In STEP 1 and 2 
trials, only sparse (trough) samples were collected. A one-compartment structural model with first-
order absorption and elimination was used to describe the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. 
Bodyweight was the most influential covariate that influenced semaglutide plasma exposure in adults.  
PK modelling 
Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses comparing the adolescent subjects in STEP Teens to the 
adult subjects in STEP 1. The final PK dataset comprised a total of 1419 subjects and 8395 
concentration samples from STEP TEENS (N=134) and STEP 1 (N=1306). A one-compartment model 
15/97 
 
 
with first-order absorption and elimination was used to describe the semaglutide PK in adults and 
adolescents.  The structural models were parameterized in terms of the following parameters: 
•  Absorption rate constant: ka 
•  Apparent clearance: CL/F 
•  Apparent volume of distribution: V/F 
Between-subject variability was included for CL/F and V/F, assuming a bivariate log-normal 
distribution. No between-subject variability was included for ka as only a typical value for ka was 
estimated due to the sparse sampling of semaglutide concentrations. Within-subject variability 
(residual) was described by a proportional error model with trial specific variances. 
A confirmatory model approach was applied for the evaluation of covariate effects. This comprised 
estimation of a full covariate model, a reduced covariate model and a base model. A reduced list of 
covariates were included in the full model; these include: Sex, Age, Race, Ethnicity, Baseline body 
weight, and Glycaemic status.

The population PK analysis showed that exposure was inversely correlated with body weight (Figure 1). 
Age caused no clinically relevant change in semaglutide exposure. Other covariates such as sex, race, 
ethnicity, and glycaemic status had no or only minor effects on exposure.  
The estimates for apparent clearance and exposure (CL/F and Cavg) were comparable between 
adolescent and adult subjects with obesity. As expected, CL/F increased with baseline BW, whereas the 
CL/F appeared to be independent of age.

The forest plot and the column to the right show means and 90% CI for the relative exposures. Body weight test 
categories (76 and 147 kg) represent the 5% and 95% percentiles, respectively in the data set. Vertical dotted lines 
indicate the acceptance interval for bioequivalence (0.80;1.25).  
The exposure levels in adolescent subjects with obesity were comparable to exposure levels in adult 
subjects with obesity as a result of the similar baseline body weights in these trials. (see Figure 2)

PK/PD modelling 
The exposure/response analyses showed a larger reduction in BMI (%) with higher exposure for both 
the adolescent population in STEP Teens and the adult population in STEP 1 (Figure 3). The exposure-
response relationship appeared slightly steeper in adolescents compared to adults; however, with a 
large overlap in exposure and response in adolescents and adults.

STEP 1 and STEP Teens from the full analysis set. 
The exposure-response relationship for the proportion of subjects reporting nausea appeared similar in 
adults and adolescents (Figure 4). The proportion of subjects reporting vomiting increased to a minor 
extent with semaglutide exposure, with similar trends in the adolescent and adult populations (Figure 
5). At similar exposure levels, higher proportions of vomiting were seen in subjects in STEP Teens 
compared to STEP 1; however, this difference was also evident in the placebo groups.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Population PK 
Overall, the population PK objectives were clear and with an appropriate description of the nature of 
the data to be analysed. The general modelling aspects, including software, estimation methods and 
diagnostics, were properly reported. The population PK analyses compared PK/exposure in the adult 
population of phase 3 trial STEP 1 (NN9536-4373) to that of the target adolescent population of STEP 
Teens (NN9536-4451). The final dataset comprised of a total of 1419 patients, of which 1295 were 
adult patients, and 124 were adolescent patients (~9%), with a total of 8395 concentration samples.  
19/97 
 
 
 
 
 
A one-compartment model parameterized with KA, CL/F and V/F was used to describe semaglutide PK 
with inter-individual variability (IIV) terms included on CL/F and V/F. IIV was not included on KA due 
to the sparse (trough) sampling scheme. Covariates were tested using a confirmatory approach, and 
the final reduced model included sex, ethnicity and glycaemic status on CL/F and body weight on CL/F 
and V/F, which is a reduced number of covariates as compared to the adult-only model. Age was not a 
statistically significant covariate. IIV was 17.9 %CV and 35 %CV on CL/F and V/F, respectively. As 
indicated by the forest plot, body weight was the most important covariate for predicting semaglutide 
exposure (Cavg) whilst the other covariates were not clinically relevant. Model-derived PK endpoints 
(Cavg, AUC0-168h and CL/F) for the adolescent population (12 to <18 years) were comparable to that 
of the adult model-derived PK endpoints. Residual unexplained variability was described by a 
proportional error model and was comparable between the adolescent and adult population (31.2% 
and 26.6%, respectively). Sensitivity analyses did not indicate any major impact on PK parameters due 
to data exclusions. All fixed and random effects were estimated with good precision (<13%RSE). 
Shrinkage was relatively low on CL/F (16.3%) but high on V/F (44.6%); hence the information for this 
effect is less informative.  
No critical model misspecifications were indicated by goodness of fit (GOF)-plots. Trial-stratified visual 
predictive checks (VPCs) indicated that the model could adequately capture the tendency of the data in 
the adolescent population as the median observed percentile was not systematically different from the 
corresponding confidence interval. However, some concentration overprediction was noted in the 5th 
percentile towards the end of the trial in the adolescent population.  
Only trough concentrations were used in the model development, so the absorption characteristics 
could not be estimated very accurately. The applicant estimated a typical value for KA but could not 
include an estimate of between-subject variability on KA. This is acceptable as the model has not been 
used for extrapolations, and the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide was comparable in the adolescent 
and adult groups.  
Approximately 10% of the subjects is aged 12 to <18 years, so the population PK model is mainly 
driven by adult data. However, body weight, the most important factor affecting the pharmacokinetics 
of semaglutide was comparable in the adolescent and adult groups. Based on VPC, pharmacokinetics 
was sufficiently well described in adolescents. Population PK analysis showed that exposure was 
inversely correlated with body weight. Age did not appear to be a clinically relevant covariate for 
semaglutide exposure, as well as any of the other tested covariates.  
Exposure-response 
Cavg was chosen as the exposure-metric for exposure-response analyses, which may not be ideal for 
exposure-safety analyses. Linear regression modelling was applied for exposure-efficacy with percent 
change in BMI (change from baseline to week 68 in BMI) as efficacy endpoint. Percent change in BMI 
increased in an exposure-dependent manner, and the relationship appeared steeper in the adolescent 
population as compared to the adult population but with an overlap in the exposure-efficacy 
relationship of the two populations. Nausea events of any severity and vomiting events of any severity 
were chosen as safety endpoints and analysed using logistic regression modelling. The proportion of 
patients with nausea appeared similar in adults and adolescents, whereas the proportion of patients 
with vomiting was slightly higher in adolescents as compared to adults. 
The exposure/response relationship appeared slightly steeper in adolescents compared to adults; 
however, with a large overlap in exposure and response in adolescents and adults. Further, the 
number of adolescent subjects reporting vomiting was slightly higher than for adult subjects, but also 
with a large overlap. The PKPD modelling is only used for descriptive purposes; the clinical efficacy and 
safety of semaglutide in adolescents are discussed in the paragraph.  
20/97 
 
 
The applicant proposes the following Changes in SmPC 5.2 (additions in bold, deletion in 
strikethrough): 
Paediatrics 
Pharmacokinetic properties for semaglutide were assessed in a clinical trial for adolescent 
patients with obesity or overweight and at least one weight-related comorbidity ages 12 to 
<18 years (124 patients, body weight 61.6.-211.9 kg). The semaglutide exposure in 
adolescents was similar to that in adults with obesity or overweight. 
Safety and efficacy of semaglutide in children and adolescents below 18 12 years of age have not 
been studied.  
No other changes based on PK or PKPD modelling are proposed.  
Although the population PK an PKPD dataset mainly consists of adult data, the data are sufficient to 
support the changes of the SmPC section 5.2. No clear differences were observed between adolescents 
and adults based on the presented exposure-response data.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Population PK analysis showed that exposure was inversely correlated with body weight in adolescents. 
This is in line with adult data. The updated text of SmPC section 5.2 is considered acceptable. No clear 
differences were observed between adolescents and adults based on the presented exposure-response 
data (BMI) or exposure-safety data (nausea and vomiting). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Main study(ies) 
3.5.1.1 Trial design 
Study STEP Teens was a multinational, randomised, double-blind, two-armed, placebo-controlled trial 
with a 68-week trial period comparing semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once weekly with placebo in pubertal 
adolescents, ages 12 to <18 years, with obesity or with overweight and ≥1 weight-related comorbidity. 
A schematic overview of the trial design is shown in Figure 6.  
According to regulatory guidelines, the trial included a run-in period of 12 weeks non-pharmacological 
lifestyle intervention before randomisation. Lifestyle intervention consisted of diet and physical activity 
counselling for weight loss and continued throughout the trial until the ‘end of trial’ (week 75). At 
randomisation, subjects were stratified by gender and Tanner stage (2-3 vs 4-5) to ensure an even 
distribution of males vs females and early vs late pubertal development. A comparator group, receiving 
placebo as well as lifestyle intervention, was included in the trial design to allow for evaluation of the 
effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg on weight management.

3.5.1.2.2 Estimands 
The efficacy-related endpoints are evaluated for two pre-specified estimands (treatment policy and 
hypothetical estimand), which are used to address the trial objectives in terms of two different aspects 
of the treatment effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg. This efficacy summary addendum only summarises 
results for the primary estimand (i.e., the treatment policy estimand).  
Primary estimand (treatment policy estimand) 
This estimand will quantify the average treatment effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg relative to placebo 
after 68 weeks, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, in all 
randomised subjects regardless of adherence to treatment and regardless of initiation of other anti-
obesity therapies (weight management drugs or bariatric surgery).  
3.5.1.3 Trial subjects 
3.5.1.3.1 Key inclusion criteria 
- Informed consent of the parent(s) or legally acceptable representative of the subject and child 
assent, as appropriate, obtained before any trial-related activities. Trial-related activities are any

*On gender and age-specific growth charts (CDC.gov). 
**Diabetes related for subjects with T2D only (at screening or if diagnosed during the trial). 
3.5.1.3.4 Withdrawal criteria 
Efforts were made to ensure treatment compliance and that subjects attended and completed all 
scheduled visit procedures. Randomised subjects were to stay in the trial irrespective of lack of 
adherence to randomised treatment, lack of adherence to visit schedule or missing assessments. Only 
if a subject or a subject’s legally acceptable representative (LAR) declined any further contact with the 
site in relation to the trial, were they to be considered as withdrawn from the trial. 
A subject could withdraw consent at will at any time, either by the subject and/or by the subject’s LAR. 
The subject’s request to withdraw from the trial was always respected. 
The subject could be prematurely discontinued from the trial product due to a safety concern, at the 
discretion of the investigator and/or if any of the criteria specified applied. 
3.5.1.3.5 Dosing strategy 
Subjects were initiated at a once-weekly dose of 0.25 mg and followed a fixed-dose escalation 
regimen, with dose intended increases every 4 weeks (to doses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.7 and 2.4 mg/week). If a 
subject did not tolerate the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg, the subject could stay at a lower dose level, 
if the subject would otherwise discontinue the trial product completely and if it was considered safe to 
continue on trial product.  
25/97 
 
 
Statistical methods 
3.5.1.3.6 Sample size 
The trial was designed with an effective power of 90% and 72% to detect differences in the primary 
and confirmatory secondary endpoints, respectively. All statistical tests were conducted at a 
significance level of 5%.  
3.5.1.3.7 Analysis sets and observation periods 
Efficacy endpoints were analysed in the full analysis set (FAS), including all randomised subjects.  
Observation periods included the in-trial period (the time from randomisation to last contact with a trial 
site, regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention) and the on-treatment period.  
3.5.1.3.8 Analysis of endpoints 
Primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints were tested in a prespecified hierarchical order. All 
results from statistical analyses were accompanied by a two-sided 95% confidence interval and 
corresponding P values (with significance defined as P<0.05).

Summary of results of individual studies – STEP Teens 
3.5.1.2 Subject disposition 
The trial enrolled 201 adolescent subjects (ages 12 to <18 years) with obesity or with overweight and 
at least one weight-related comorbidity. Subjects were randomised 2:1 to receive either semaglutide 
2.4 mg or placebo.  
The proportion of treatment completers (subjects on treatment at week 68) and trial completers 
(subjects who attended the end-of-trial visit) was similar between the semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo 
groups. 
In the FDA semaglutide Written Request, it was required that at least 150 patients should have an 
assessment of BMI at week 68, regardless of whether the subject remained on the study drug or 
completed other study assessments. As seen in the tables below, this requirement was met in the trial. 
Permanent discontinuation of trial product due to AEs was reported by 4.5% of subjects with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg vs 6.0% with placebo.

N: Number of subjects, %: Percentages are based on randomised subjects. 
* Includes two subjects who were withdrawn before the run-in period started. 
A time-point is considered as on-treatment if any dose of trial product has been administered 
within 
the prior 14 days. Permanent discontinuation is when a subject stopped taking trial product and 
did 
not resume treatment and is therefore not considered as 'on-treatment' at end of treatment period 
(week 68). Temporary interruption is when a subject missed at least 2 consecutive doses of trial 
product and resumed treatment before end of treatment period (week 68). 
Only reasons for permanent discontinuation of trial product or trial withdrawal actually recorded 
for at least one subject are presented. 
3.5.1.3 Demographics and baseline characteristics 
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the semaglutide 
2.4 mg and placebo groups, although baseline BMI and body weight were higher in the semaglutide 
2.4 mg group, as shown in the tables below.  
In the FDA semaglutide Written Request, it was required that the population in STEP Teens included a 
minimum of 30% of subjects between ages 12 to 14, and 30% of subjects needed to be male. As seen 
in the table belwo, both these requirements were met.

CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. N: Number of subjects, %: Percentages are based 
on number of subjects, BMI: Body mass index. Overall Tanner Stage for each subject is calculated 
as maximum Tanner Stage combining all the categorical questions per visit. 
The last available and eligible observation at or prior to the randomisation visit was selected 
for 
summary except for age where date of informed consent was used. Weight categories according to CDC 
are based on BMI growth charts: Normal weight: BMI <85th percentile; Overweight: BMI >=85th - 
<95th 
percentile; Obesity class I: BMI >=95th - <120% of the 95th percentile; Obesity class II: BMI 
>=120% 
of the 95th percentile - <140% of the 95th percentile; Obesity class III: BMI >=140% of the 95th 
percentile.

The estimated change from baseline BMI (%) at week 68 was -16.14% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 
0.61% with placebo. With semaglutide 2.4 mg, 72.5% of subjects achieved ≥5% weight loss vs 17.7% 
with placebo. 
3.5.1.4.2 BMI (%) change from baseline 
The superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo was confirmed for the primary endpoint; change in 
BMI (%) from baseline (week 0) to week 68.  
The BMI (%) change from baseline occurred during the first 52 weeks with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
treatment, after which a plateau was reached. With placebo, mean BMI (%) change from baseline was 
very limited and the BMI remained close to the baseline level throughout the trial.

3.5.1.4.3 Body weight – categorical response 
Body weight reduction of ≥5% from baseline (week 0) to week 68 was a confirmatory secondary 
endpoint in STEP Teens. The superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo was demonstrated in terms 
of the proportion of subjects achieving ≥5% body weight reduction from baseline to week 68, with 
odds ratios (ORs) in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg.  
The proportions of subjects achieving ≥10%, ≥15% or ≥20% body weight reduction from baseline to 
week 68 were also greater with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo, with more than half of the 
subjects achieving a weight loss of at least 15%.

3.5.1.4.4 BMI – categorical response 
The estimated proportion of subjects with ≥5% reduction in BMI from baseline to week 68 was greater 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg (77.1%) compared to placebo (19.7 %). The OR was 13.76 [ 6.31; 30.02]95% 
CI, favouring semaglutide 2.4 mg. 
3.5.1.4.5 Body weight (kg, %) 
At baseline, the mean body weight (kg) was slightly higher with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 
placebo. Mean decrease in body weight (kg, %) was greater with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 
placebo. The decrease with semaglutide 2.4 mg reached a plateau around week 52. With placebo, a 
slight increase in body weight occurred towards the end of the trial.  
The estimated treatment differences (ETDs) for change in body weight were in favour of semaglutide 
2.4 mg vs placebo: 
•  Body weight (kg): ETD: -17.73 kg [-21.76; -13.70]95% CI

At baseline (week 0) mean BMI (kg/m2) was slightly higher for the semaglutide 2.4 mg group 
compared to the placebo group. For the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, mean BMI decreased from baseline 
to week 68. With placebo, the mean BMI remained at the same level throughout the trial, even though 
there was a slight increase in body weight. The estimated mean change in BMI from baseline to 
week 68 was -5.85 kg/m2 for the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 0.11 kg/m2 for the placebo group, 
resulting in an ETD of -5.96 kg/m2 [-7.29; -4.62]95% CI in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg.

3.5.1.4.7 BMI percentage of the 95th percentile 
In STEP Teens, the BMI cut-off for obesity for adolescents was defined as the 95th percentile on 
gender- and age-specific growth charts, according to CDC.gov. 
From baseline to week 68, the estimated mean BMI percentage of the 95th percentile on gender and 
age-specific growth charts decreased more with semaglutide 2.4 mg (-24.58 %-points) than with 
placebo (-4.18 %-points), ETD:  -20.40 %-points [-25.01; -15.79]95% CI. 
3.5.1.4.8 BMI SDS 
In STEP Teens, the BMI SDS were calculated using growth reference data for children and adolescents 
(5-19 years) from WHO.int.  
From baseline to week 68, the estimated mean BMI SDS decreased considerably more with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg (-1.09) than with placebo (-0.06), with an ETD of -1.03 [-1.27; -0.80]95% CI. 
3.5.1.4.9 Improvement in weight category 
In STEP Teens, improvements in weight category from baseline to week 68 was a supportive secondary 
endpoint. Weight categories for the adolescent population were defined based on CDC’s gender- and 
age-specific BMI growth charts, as presented in the table below.

•  Weight categories for adolescent population, defined based on gender and age-specific BMI 
growth charts (CDC.gov). 
From baseline to week 68, improvement in weight category was seen for a larger proportion of 
subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg (71.8%) compared to placebo (21.0%). In the semaglutide 2.4 mg 
group, a considerable proportion of subjects shifted more than one level in the weight category. The 
odds of achieving improvement in the weight category at week 68 was greater with semaglutide 2.4 
mg than with placebo. 
3.5.1.4.10 Waist circumference 
The estimated decreases in waist circumference (cm) from baseline to week 68 were -12.69 cm with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and -0.55 cm with placebo and the ETD was statistically significant in favour of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg (-12.14 cm [-15.59; -8.69]95% CI

HbA1c 
The adolescent population in STEP Teens included subjects with and without T2D.  
For subjects without T2D at baseline, the mean HbA1c levels at baseline were 5.5% with semaglutide 
2.4 mg and 5.4% with placebo. The estimated mean change in HbA1c from baseline to week 68 
was -0.35 %-points with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to -0.14 %-points with placebo, with a 
statistically significant ETD in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg (-0.22 %-points [-0.29; -0.14]95%CI. 
For subjects with T2D at baseline (n=8), mean HbA1c levels at baseline were 6.7% with semaglutide 
2.4 mg and 6.1% with placebo.

Blood pressure 
At baseline, the observed mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
were the same in both treatment groups (SBP: 120 mmHg; DBP: 73mmHg). A minor decrease in SBP 
and DBP were seen in both groups with no statistically significant difference between the groups.

Lipids 
Beneficial effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo were observed for all lipid parameters from 
baseline to week 68. The estimated treatment ratios (ETRs) were statistically significant in favour of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides.

Alanine aminotransferase 
In STEP Teens, ALT (U/L) change from baseline to week 68 with semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo was a 
supportive secondary endpoint. In week 68, mean ALT levels decreased with semaglutide 2.4 mg, 
whereas it remained at the same level with placebo. The ETR was statistically significant in favour of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg (ETR: 0.86 [0.75;0.99]95% CI). 
3.5.1.4.13 Patient reported outcome - Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Kids 
(IWQOL-Kids)  
The IWQOL-Kids questionnaire was used to assess weight-related quality of life in adolescents. The 
following four domain scores and a total score were calculated: 
- Physical comfort 
- Body esteem 
- Social life 
- Family relations 
For all the individual domain scores, improvements in individual scores were seen with semaglutide 
2.4 mg compared to placebo. The ETDs for the physical comfort score and the total score were

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once weekly (Wegovy) has been approved as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie 
diet and increased physical activity for weight management, including weight loss and weight 
maintenance in adults with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) and at least one 
weight-related comorbidity. This variation application aims at extending the current Wegovy label with 
results from STEP Teens demonstrating the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg in an adolescent 
population.  
This trial is a 68-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect and 
safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly in adolescents with obesity (BMI corresponding to ≥95th 
percentile*) or with overweight (BMI corresponding to ≥85th percentile*) and at least one weight-related 
comorbidity (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea or T2D). 
The company initially proposed an extension of the indication in the adolescent population with 
overweight or obesity. However, the company subsequently acknowledged that only one subject was 
within the overweight with comorbidities category at baseline. Therefore, the benefit/risk ratio in 
individuals with overweight cannot be determined and an indication in overweight adolescents with 
comorbidities was not accepted. This is in line with the adolescent indication for Saxenda (liraglutide). 
Overweight adolescents with comorbidities were not included in the clinical trial with liraglutide, and 
liraglutide does not have an indication for overweight adolescents with comorbidities. The company 
removed the indication in overweight adolescents. 
According to regulatory guidelines, the trial included a run-in period of 12 weeks non-pharmacological 
lifestyle intervention before randomisation. Lifestyle intervention consisted of diet and physical activity 
counselling for weight loss and continued throughout the trial. 
Primary objective was to compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo 
as an adjunct to a reduced- calorie diet and increased physical activity on weight management in 
adolescents (ages 12 to <18 years) with overweight or obesity. 
Primary endpoint: 
Change in BMI from baseline (week 0) to week 68 (%) 
Confirmatory secondary endpoint: 
Subjects achieving ≥5% reduction of body weight from baseline (week 0) to week 68 (yes/no). 
The use of the treatment policy estimand as the primary estimand is acceptable. 
For subjects with T2D only, uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy was 
an exclusion criterion. This is clearly stated in the product information. 
The inclusion criteria on BMI were based on CDC criteria instead of World Health Organization (WHO) 
criteria or international obesity task force (IOTF) criteria. Age and gender-specific BMI for inclusion is 
endorsed. The age-specific cut-offs for overweight and obesity are almost similar to the cut-off values 
defined by IOTF, which was used for Saxenda. 
Regarding the WHO criteria, the cut-off values for overweight and obesity are generally lower for all age 
groups from 12-18 years and for both genders. Hence, the risk of overtreatment of the European 
population is not an issue when using the CDC criteria.

The trial enrolled 201 adolescent subjects (ages 12 to <18 years) with obesity or with overweight and at 
least one weight-related comorbidity. Subjects were randomised 2:1 to receive either semaglutide 2.4 mg 
or placebo. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The proportions of treatment completers (subjects on treatment at week 68) and trial completers 
(subjects who attended the end-of-trial visit) were similar between the semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo 
groups (89.6%). 
Permanent discontinuation of trial product due to AEs was reported by 4.5% of subjects with semaglutide 
2.4 mg vs 6.0% with placebo.  
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the semaglutide 2.4 
mg and placebo groups, although baseline BMI and body weight were higher in the semaglutide 2.4 mg 
group (37.7 vs 35.7 kg/m2; 109.9 vs 102.6 kg). However, the statistical analyses adjusted for this 
baseline difference. 
Additionally, a higher frequency of dyslipidaemia was seen in the semaglutide arm, which is in line with 
the higher BMI in this group. On the other hand, a higher proportion of subjects with type 2 diabetes was 
seen in the placebo group, 4.5% vs. 3.7%; however, the numbers are very small (3 subjects in the 
placebo group and 5 subjects in the semaglutide group). 
Effects on BMI and weight 
The estimated change from baseline in BMI (%) at week 68 was -16.14% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 
0.61% with placebo. With semaglutide 2.4 mg, 72.5% of subjects achieved ≥5% weight loss vs 17.7% 
with placebo. 27.5% of the patients treated with semaglutide had a weight loss less than 5%. Almost 
10% of the patients did not have a decrease in BMI or an increase. The ETDs for change in body weight 
were in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo: -17.73 kg (95% CI -21.76; -13.70) and -17.42% (95% 
CI -21.08; -13.75). 
Of the subjects in STEP Teens, who were randomised to the semaglutide arm and completed treatment, 
15 subjects were on a lower dose than semaglutide 2.4 mg by the end of the treatment period (week 68). 
14 out of 15 subjects not ending on the maximum semaglutide dose had a relevant weight loss, and one 
subject had an increase in bodyweight (increase in 6.6%). The reduction in BMI ranges from 14.9% to 
41.1%. Nine of the 15 subjects reached the maximum dose of 2.4 mg and thereafter decreased the dose 
stepwise to 1.7 mg, 1.0 mg or 0.5 mg. Based on these data no minimum dose should be stated in the 
SmPC and the proposed text in section 4.2 of the SmPC is acceptable.  
Other endpoints 
For subjects without T2D at baseline, the estimated mean change in HbA1c from baseline to week 68 
was -0.35 %-points with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to -0.14 %-points with placebo, with a 
statistically significant ETD in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg (-0.22 %-points [-0.29; -0.14]. 
For subjects with T2D at baseline (n=8), HbA1c decreased -1.0 %-point in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group 
(n=5), whereas the change was 0.3 %-point in the placebo group (n=3), but the groups were very small. 
A minor decrease in SBP and DBP was seen in both groups, with no statistically significant difference 
between the groups. 
Beneficial effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo were observed for all lipid parameters from baseline 
to week 68. The estimated treatment ratios (ETRs) were statistically significant in favour of semaglutide 
2.4 mg for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides. However, the estimates

were not multiplicity adjusted; hence, the beneficial findings in terms of ETRs are regarded as exploratory 
only. 
For all the individual domain scores, improvements in individual scores were seen with semaglutide 2.4 
mg compared to placebo. The ETDs for the physical comfort score and the total score were statistically 
significant in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The effect of semaglutide on body weight and BMI was clinically relevant. However, 27.5% of the patients 
treated with semaglutide had a weight loss of less than 5%. Almost 10% of the patients did not have a 
decrease in BMI or an increase. A stopping rule is important in order to try to avoid unnecessary 
treatment of this subgroup. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Of the 201 subjects randomised 2:1 to treatment, 200 were exposed to the trial product: 133 subjects in 
the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (181.8 patient years exposure (PYE), 192.0 person-years of observation 
(PYO)); 67 subjects in the placebo group (90.4 PYE, 94.0 PYO). 
Overall, 89.6% completed treatment and 97.5% of subjects completed the trial. Comparable proportions 
of subjects in both treatment groups completed treatment (89.6% for both treatment groups) and 
completed the trial (98.5% semaglutide 2.4 mg group; 95.5% placebo group). 
Dosing was initiated at 0.25 mg of semaglutide or the comparable volume of placebo. Both groups then 
escalated the dose every 4 weeks, over a period of 16 weeks, to 2.4 mg of semaglutide (or the 
comparable volume of placebo) or to the maximum tolerated dose. Dose escalation occurred comparably 
in both treatment groups to week 16. At week 28, 90.2% of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, 
and 98.4% of subjects on placebo, were at the target dose of 2.4 mg. Most subjects in both treatment 
groups remained at the target dose through the remainder of the trial (week 68). 
Adverse events 
The proportion of subjects with AEs, was comparable between the treatment groups (78.9% in 
semaglutide 2.4 mg vs 82.1% in placebo). The rate of AEs reported, was higher with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
than with placebo (435.7 events per 100 PYE in semaglutide 2.4 mg vs 362.9 events per 100 PYE in 
placebo), driven primarily by gastro-intestinal (GI) AEs.

Figure  
Adverse events by system organ class - summary plot - on-treatment 
The relative distribution of AEs with respect to seriousness, severity and outcome were comparable across 
both groups, with most being non-serious, of mild or moderate severity, and reported as recovered. 
A higher proportion of AEs in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group was considered probably or possibly related 
to the trial product compared with the placebo. This higher rate of attributing causality to the trial product 
in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group reflects the greater proportion of GI events in this group, as GI 
symptoms are a well-known side-effect of Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) 
treatment. 
A higher proportion of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group compared to placebo reduced their dose 
(12.0% vs 1.5%) due to AEs. However, comparable proportions of subjects in both treatment groups 
temporarily interrupted treatment (10.5% vs 7.5%), or permanently discontinued treatment (4.5% vs 
4.5%) due to AEs.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Few (24) serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported during the on-treatment period, 17 in the 
semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 7 in the placebo group. Both the proportion of subjects with SAEs (11.3% 
vs 9.0%), and the rates of reporting SAEs (9.4 vs 7.7 events per 100 PYE) were comparable between 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo. Most of the events, in both treatment groups, were moderate in 
severity, and the subjects recovered. The SAEs in both groups were distributed, in low numbers, across 
several preferred terms (PTs), with no evident patterning. In the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, there was a 
small concentration (5 events in 4 subjects) of SAEs in the system organ class (SOC) Hepatobiliary 
disorders, primarily related to events of cholelithiasis (see below). 
No deaths were reported in this trial. 
Other significant adverse events  
Adverse events leading to withdrawal, discontinuation, and dose reductions 
None of the 5 subjects, 2 in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 3 in the placebo group, who withdrew 
from the trial cited AEs as the reason for withdrawal. 
Nine AEs led to permanent discontinuation of treatment, 6 in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 3 in 
placebo. The proportion of subjects (4.5%), and rates of reporting, were the same in both treatment 
groups. The AEs were distributed across a range of PTs, with 4 of the events (3 in the semaglutide 2.4 
mg group and 1 in placebo) occurring in the GI disorders SOC. 
Assessment report

Comparable proportions of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (10.5%) temporarily interrupted 
treatment with the trial product due to AEs compared to placebo (7.5%). Most of the events in both 
treatment groups occurred in the GI disorders SOC, led by vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, and abdominal 
pain. Five AEs in 5 subjects (3.0%) in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group occurred in the Hepatobiliary 
disorders SOC. 
Forty-six AEs, in 17 subjects led to dose reduction. All of the AEs leading to dose reduction occurred in 
the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, with the exception of 4 events in one subject in the placebo group. Most 
of the AEs in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (29 events in 13 subjects) were related to GI disorders. 
Safety focus areas 
No events related to malignant neoplasms, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, diabetic retinopathy, 
medication errors, or suspected transmission of an infectious agent via trial product were reported .

Gastrointestinal disorders 
GI disorders were reported by a higher proportion of subjects, and at a higher rate, in the semaglutide 
2.4 mg group compared to placebo (61.7%, 211.8 events per 100 PYE vs 41.8%, 106.2 events per 100 
PYE).

Figure  
Gastrointestinal adverse events - by preferred term – summary plot - on-
treatment - safety analysis set 
In both the semaglutide 2.4 mg and the placebo groups, the majority of GI AEs were non-serious, mild or 
moderate in severity, and had a median duration of 2-3 days. Comparable proportions of events in both 
groups led to permanent treatment discontinuation (2.3% semaglutide 2.4 mg: 1.5% placebo) and 
temporary interruption of the trial product (5.3% semaglutide 2.4 mg: 4.5% placebo). A greater 
proportion of GI AEs in the semaglutide group (9.8%) compared to placebo (1.5%) led to dose reduction. 
Treatment differences between semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo for the most frequently reported GI 
disorders were comparable to those seen in the adult semaglutide 2.4 mg development programme for 
weight management. 
Hepatic disorders 
A total of 14 hepatic AEs were reported: 13 events in 10 subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 
one event in one subject in the placebo group. The proportion of subjects reporting events, and the event 
rate, were higher in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (7.5%, 7.2 per 100 PYE) than with placebo (1.5%, 1.1 
per 100 PYE). Notably, a greater proportion of subjects with pre-existing hepatic disorders were 
randomised to the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (18.7%, 25 subjects) than with placebo (11.9%, 8 
subjects) and 4 of the AEs were reported at randomisation. 
In STEP Teens, mean levels of ALT decreased -23% in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group as opposed to a 4% 
increase in the placebo group. Mean AST levels decreased -13% in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and -
4.0% in the placebo group. In the semaglutide 2.4 mg adult weight management program, mean levels 
of ALT (-26% vs -13%) and AST (-12% vs -4%) similarly decreased to a greater extent with semaglutide 
2.4 mg compared to placebo. As in the adult programme, overall improvements in liver function in STEP 
Teens, as assessed by the mean levels of liver enzymes, supports the beneficial effect of weight loss on

liver function in the general population with overweight or obesity, with or without evidence of liver 
disease. 
The higher proportion of AEs reported in subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group in STEP Teens is likely 
related to both the greater proportion of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group with hepatic disorders 
in their medical histories than in the placebo group, and the reporting of events occurring at 
randomisation (prior to treatment) as AEs rather than medical history. 
Acute gall bladder disease 
Six events of acute gall bladder disease were reported in 5 subjects (3.8%) in the semaglutide 2.4 mg 
group, which will be included in the paediatric section of the label. One event in one subject (0.8%) of 
acute cholecystitis was co-reported with one of the events of cholelithiasis. No events of gall bladder 
disease were reported in the placebo group. 
Obesity is a well-established risk factor for acute gall bladder disease, including the adolescent 
population. Additionally, rapid, marked weight loss, in both adults and children with obesity, has also 
been associated with gallstone development. 
Cholelithiasis is an identified risk for semaglutide 2.4 mg and is included as an adverse drug reaction 
(ADR) in the labelling for Wegovy. 
Psychiatric disorders 
In addition to AE reporting, mental health questionnaires, the PHQ-9 and C-SSRS, were administered at 
randomisation, and then periodically during the trial.  
The proportion of subjects reporting events related to psychiatric disorders, and the event rate, was lower 
in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group than the placebo group. The events in both groups were distributed 
across a broad range of PTs. Most of the events, in both treatment groups, were non-serious, mild to 
moderate in severity, unlikely related to trial product, and recovering or not recovered. One event, Mental 
disorder, in the placebo group led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. One event of suicidal 
ideation in the placebo group was reported as non-serious, moderate, unlikely related to treatment and 
recovered. 
One SAE of Depression in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group was reported as severe, possibly related to trial 
product, and not recovered. The event occurred on trial day 493, so the action taken to product was, ‘Not 
Applicable’ (the subject was already off-treatment). 
Total scores for the PHQ-9 for both treatment groups were comparable at randomisation. Responses to 
Question 9, which directly addresses levels of suicidality, were also comparable. At end of treatment (visit 
30, week 68), there were no notable changes in either total scores, or responses to Question 9. Most 
subjects in both treatment groups remained in categories that do not indicate increased suicidality risk or 
depression. 
Baseline C-SSRS total mean scores indicated a slightly lower proportion of subjects with suicidal 
ideation/behaviour in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group. At end of trial, there was a 
reduction overall in the scores indicating suicidal ideation/behaviour; however, there were no notable 
treatment differences between the groups.

Laboratory findings 
No clinically relevant safety findings were identified in relation to haematology, biochemistry, hormones, 
lipids, or calcitonin. 
At baseline, mean levels of ALT, AST and GGT were comparable across both treatment groups. Mean 
reductions of all three liver enzymes were greater in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group than in the placebo 
group. Individual elevations in liver enzymes exceeding pre-defined safety thresholds primarily occurred 
in subjects with pre-existing liver disorders. 
Although there were greater increases in both amylase and lipase from baseline in the semaglutide 2.4 
mg group compared to placebo, the mean values remained within normal reference ranges throughout 
the treatment period. Increases in amylase and lipase are consistent with the safety profile of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg in adult populations, where they were similarly not seen as predictive of acute 
pancreatitis.  
From baseline to week 75, one (1) of the 133 subjects tested positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies at 
week 68. The subject’s sample was negative at week 75, thus, the positive result was likely a transient 
antibody response. No subjects tested positive for either anti-semaglutide neutralising antibodies or anti-
semaglutide antibodies cross-reacting with endogenous GLP-1.  
Vital signs and other observations related to safety 
Pulse and ECG 
At baseline, mean pulse was comparable in both treatment groups. During the treatment period, the 
mean pulse was higher in the semaglutide 2.4 mg compared with the placebo group; however, at the end 
of the trial, mean pulse rates in both treatment groups returned to near baseline levels.  
No clinically relevant treatment difference was noted between the treatment groups in ECGs.  
Growth and development assessments 
In addition to body measurement, growth and development were evaluated by assessing height SDS, 
bone age, bone metabolism biomarkers, Tanner pubertal stage, and pituitary-gonadal hormones. No 
clinically relevant treatment differences were noted in any of the growth and development parameters.  
Hypoglycaemic events (T2D subjects) 
Hypoglycaemic episodes in the T2D population of the trial were reported using 3 methods of event 
classification: ADA/ISPAD 2014, ADA/ISPAD 2018, and Novo Nordisk Classification. 
In the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, there were 5 subjects with T2D. Two hypoglycaemic events were 
reported in 2 subjects. Neither event was reported as severe. One event was symptomatic however the 
blood glucose (BG) level was not reported, and the second event was asymptomatic with a BG level ≤ 3.9 
mmol/L (70 mg/dL). 
In the placebo group, there were 3 subjects with T2D. Four hypoglycaemic events were reported in 3 
subjects. One of the events was reported as a BG confirmed symptomatic event (BG level < 3.1 mmol/L 
(56 mg/dL)). Two of the events were symptomatic with BG levels ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). One event 
was symptomatic with a BG level > 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Of the 201 subjects randomised 2:1 to treatment, 200 were exposed to the trial product: 133 subjects in 
the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (181.8 PYE, 192.0 PYO); 67 subjects in the placebo group (90.4 PYE, 94.0 
PYO). 
Overall, 89.6% completed treatment and 97.5% of subjects completed the trial. Comparable proportions 
of subjects in both treatment groups completed treatment (89.6% for both treatment groups) and 
completed the trial (98.5% semaglutide 2.4 mg group; 95.5% placebo group). 
Adverse events 
The proportion of subjects with AEs, was comparable between the treatment groups (78.9% in 
semaglutide 2.4 mg vs 82.1% in placebo). The rate of AEs reported was higher with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
than with placebo (435.7 events per 100 PYE in semaglutide 2.4 mg vs 362.9 events per 100 PYE in 
placebo). As expected, this was driven primarily by GI AEs. 
In both treatment groups, most AEs were reported within the first 20 weeks following randomisation. Few 
(24) SAEs were reported during the on-treatment period, 17 in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 7 in 
the placebo group.  
Serious adverse events 
Both the proportion of subjects with SAEs (11.3% vs 9.0%), and the rates of reporting SAEs (9.4 vs 7.7 
events per 100 PYE) were comparable between semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo. Most of the events, in 
both treatment groups, were moderate in severity, and the subjects recovered. 
GI adverse events 
GI disorders were reported by a higher proportion of subjects, and at a higher rate, in the semaglutide 
2.4 mg group compared to placebo (61.7%, 211.8 events per 100 PYE vs 41.8%, 106.2 events per 100 
PYE). In both the semaglutide 2.4 mg and the placebo groups, the majority of GI AEs were non-serious, 
mild or moderate in severity, and had a median duration of 2-3 days. Comparable proportions of events 
in both groups led to permanent treatment discontinuation (2.3% semaglutide 2.4 mg: 1.5% placebo) 
and temporary interruption of trial product (5.3% semaglutide 2.4 mg: 4.5% placebo). A greater 
proportion of GI AEs in the semaglutide group (9.8%) compared to placebo (1.5%) led to dose reduction. 
Hepatic adverse events 
A total of 14 hepatic AEs were reported: 13 events in 10 subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 
one event in one subject in the placebo group. The proportion of subjects reporting events, and the event 
rate, were higher in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (7.5%, 7.2 per 100 PYE) than with placebo (1.5%, 1.1 
per 100 PYE). Notably, a greater proportion of subjects with pre-existing hepatic disorders were 
randomised to the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (18.7%, 25 subjects) than with placebo (11.9%, 8 
subjects) and 4 of the AEs were reported at randomisation. 
In STEP Teens, mean levels of ALT decreased -23% in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group as opposed to a 4% 
increase in the placebo group. Mean AST levels decreased -13% in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and -
4.0% in the placebo group. 
The higher proportion of hepatic AEs reported in subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group in STEP Teens 
is maybe partly related to the greater proportion of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group with 
hepatic disorders in their medical histories than in the placebo group.  In addition, there is an overall 
mean improvement in liver enzyme levels in subjects randomised to semaglutide 2.4 mg. In combination 
with the clinical and non-clinical evidence from both the adult semaglutide 2.4 mg programmes and the 
Assessment report  
Error! Unknown document property name. 
Page 54/66 
 
 
 
 
GLP-1 RA drug class, there are no hepatic safety concerns related to the treatment with semaglutide 2.4 
mg in the adolescent population.  
Gall bladder 
Six events of acute gall bladder disease were reported in 5 subjects (3.8%) in the semaglutide 2.4 mg 
group, and 0% patients treated with placebo, which is included in the paediatric section of the label. It 
should be noted that the frequency is numerically higher than what has been observed in the adult 
studies 3.8% in children and 1.6% in adults.  
Other significant adverse events  
Mental health questionnaires (the PHQ-9 and C-SSRS) showed no relevant differences between 
semaglutide and placebo. 
No clinically relevant safety findings were identified in relation to haematology, biochemistry, hormones, 
lipids, or calcitonin. Although there were greater increases in both amylase and lipase from baseline in 
the semaglutide 2.4 mg group compared to placebo, the mean values remained within normal reference 
ranges throughout the treatment period. Increases in amylase and lipase are consistent with the safety 
profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg in adult populations, where they were similarly not seen as predictive of 
acute pancreatitis.  
During the treatment period, mean pulse was higher in the semaglutide 2.4 mg compared with the 
placebo group. This is similar to the increase in pulse in adults. 
There were no clinically relevant effects of semaglutide on hypoglycaemia in patients with diabetes.  
In addition to body measurement, growth and development were evaluated by assessing height SDS, 
bone age, bone metabolism biomarkers, Tanner pubertal stage, and pituitary-gonadal hormones. No 
clinically relevant treatment differences were noted in any of the growth and development parameters. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In general, the safety and tolerability data from STEP Teens are comparable with the safety profile 
established in the adult clinical development programmes with semaglutide 2.4 mg and other GLP 1 RAs.  
As expected, the most frequently reported AEs with semaglutide 2.4 mg in adolescent subjects were GI-
related AEs. The higher incidence of cholelithiasis in populations with obesity, and rapid, significant 
weight loss is well known and is included in the appropriate sections of the product information. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle

3.1.  Update of the Product information (PI) 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes.  
3.1.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• 
The changes to the patient leaflet are not considered significant 
•  A user consultation was made for semaglutide during the marketing authorisation application 
approved in 2022 
•  A user consultation was made for the additional pen-presentation (PDS290) approved in 2022.

4.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
4.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once weekly (Wegovy) has been approved as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie 
diet and increased physical activity for weight management. This variation application aims at extending 
the current Wegovy label with results from STEP Teens demonstrating the efficacy and safety of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg in an adolescent population (ages 12 to <18 years) with obesity or with overweight 
and at least one weight-related comorbidity.  
4.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents has been increasing steadily during the past 
decades and has reached alarming proportions. It is expected that more than 250 million children and 
adolescents worldwide will be living with obesity by 2030. 
4.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Pharmacotherapy may serve as a valuable adjunct to lifestyle modification for children and adolescents 
with obesity or overweight. 
4.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once weekly (Wegovy) has been approved as an adjunct to a reduced calorie 
diet and increased physical activity for weight management, including weight loss and weight 
maintenance in adults with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) and at least one 
weight-related comorbidity (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea or T2D). This variation 
application aims at extending the current Wegovy indication based on the results from STEP Teens 
demonstrating the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg in an adolescent population.  
This trial (STEP Teens) was a 68-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating 
the effect and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly in adolescents with obesity (BMI corresponding 
to ≥95th percentile*) or with overweight (BMI corresponding to ≥85th percentile*) and at least one 
weight-related comorbidity. 
According to regulatory guidelines, the trial included a run-in period of 12 weeks of non-pharmacological 
lifestyle intervention before randomisation. Lifestyle intervention consisted of diet and physical activity 
counselling for weight loss and continued throughout the trial. 
Primary objective and endpoints 
The primary objective was to compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. once-weekly versus semaglutide 
placebo as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity on weight management in 
adolescents (ages 12 to <18 years) with overweight or obesity. 
Primary endpoint: 
Change in BMI from baseline (week 0) to week 68 (%). 
Confirmatory secondary endpoint: 
Subjects achieving ≥5% reduction of body weight from baseline (week 0) to week 68 (yes/no).

The use of the treatment policy estimand as the primary estimand is acceptable. 
For subjects with T2D only, uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy was 
an exclusion criterion. This is clearly stated in the product information. 
The trial enrolled 201 adolescent subjects (ages 12 to <18 years) with obesity or with overweight and at 
least one weight-related comorbidity. Subjects were randomised 2:1 to receive either semaglutide 2.4 mg 
or placebo.  
The proportions of treatment completers (subjects on treatment at week 68) and trial completers 
(subjects who attended the end-of-trial visit) were similar between the semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo 
groups (89.6%). 
Permanent discontinuation of trial product due to AEs was reported by 4.5% of subjects with semaglutide 
2.4 mg vs 6.0% with placebo.  
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the semaglutide 2.4 
mg and placebo groups, although baseline BMI and body weight were higher in the semaglutide 2.4 mg 
group (37.7 vs 35.7 kg/m2; 109.9 vs 102.6 kg). 
4.2.  Favourable effects 
Effects on BMI and weight 
The estimated change from baseline in BMI (%) at week 68 was -16.14% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 
0.61% with placebo. With semaglutide 2.4 mg, 72.5% of subjects achieved ≥5% weight loss vs 17.7% 
with placebo. The ETDs for change in body weight were in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo: -
17.73 kg (95% CI -21.76; -13.70) and -17.42% (95% CI -21.08; -13.75). 
Other endpoints 
For subjects without T2D at baseline, the estimated mean change in HbA1c from baseline to week 68 was  
0.35 % points with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to -0.14 % points with placebo, with a statistically 
significant ETD in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg (0.22 % points [ 0.29;  0.14]). 
For subjects with T2D at baseline (n=8), HbA1c decreased -1.0 %-point in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group 
(n=5), whereas the change was 0.3 %-point in the placebo group (n=3), but the groups were very small. 
A minor decrease in SBP and DBP were seen in both groups, with no statistically significant difference 
between the groups. 
For all the individual domain scores, improvements in individual scores were seen with semaglutide 2.4 
mg compared to placebo. The ETDs for the physical comfort score and the total score were statistically 
significant in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo. 
4.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
On average, body weight loss was clinically relevant, but 27.5% of the patients treated with semaglutide 
had a weight loss of less than 5%. Almost 10% of the patients did not have a decrease in BMI or an 
increase. Other weight loss products such as Saxenda, Mysimba and Xenical have stopping rules included 
in the indication. For adolescents using Saxenda, treatment should be discontinued and re-evaluated if 
adolescents have not lost at least 4% of their BMI or BMI z score after 12 weeks on the maximum 
tolerated dose. For Wegovy, a stopping rule could not be defined in the adult population. In STEP 4, using 
a week 20 weight loss criterion of 5% for a stopping rule, it was demonstrated that a high proportion of 
early non-responders went on to achieve a clinically relevant weight loss by week 68. Among week 20

early non-responders, 51.6% of subjects randomised to continued semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment 
achieved a clinically significant weight loss by week 68. This is an important and relevant adult subgroup 
that would have been erroneously discontinued from treatment based on this stopping rule. The company 
also did early responder analyses for other percentages of early weight loss. Even if an early weight loss 
criterion of 1% was used, 47% of the adult early non-responders went on to achieve clinically relevant 
weight loss by week 68. 
The company investigated a possible stopping rule for adolescents. The Applicant has provided data on 
various levels of BMI change at day 28, which is a BMI ≥ 3%, BMI ≥4 % and BMI ≥5 %.  
With a stopping rule of BMI reduction of at least 5%, the positive predictive value is 86/93 (92%) and the 
negative predictive value is 21/29 (72%). In other words, 8% (7/93) of the initial responders continued 
treatment without a significant weight loss at study end, whereas 27.6% (8/29) of the initial non-
responders had significant weight loss at study end. With a lower threshold, the positive predictive value 
decreases (91/106 =86% with a threshold of ≥3%) and the negative predictive value increases (13/16= 
81% with a threshold of ≥3%). In other words, with a threshold of ≥3%, 14% (15/106) of the initial 
responders continued treatment without a significant weight loss at the study end, whereas 19% (3/16) 
of the initial non-responders had significant weight loss at the study end. It is considered very important 
to avoid the treatment of subjects who will not benefit from treatment. Therefore, the positive predictive 
value should be high. The lowest proportion of misclassified subjects (false responders and false non-
responders) is seen with a threshold of ≥5%, where 7 subjects are misclassified as responders and 8 
subjects are misclassified as non-responders. Hence, based on the data provided by the Applicant, it is 
suggested that a stopping rule of ≥ 5% should be added to the SmPC. The company first proposed a 
stopping rule stating that treatment should be re-evaluated if adolescent patients have not reduced their 
BMI by at least 5%. This proposed stopping rule did not contain the recommendation to discontinue 
treatment. Following the outcome of the CHMP assessment, the finally agreed stopping rule now states 
that treatment should be discontinued and re-evaluated if weight loss is not sufficient. This is in line with 
the stopping rule for Saxenda in paedicatric individuals  
There is only experience with Wegovy in individuals with a body weight >60 kg. This is similar to the 
experience with Saxenda. The indication of Saxenda, therefore, states that Saxenda is only indicated for 
adolescents with a body weight above 60 kg. This lower bound of body weight is now included in the 
indication of Wegovy.  
The number of overweight subjects included in the study could not be found in the clinical study report 
(CSR) and related documents. The company acknowledged that only one subject was within the 
overweight with comorbidities category at baseline. As only one subject was within the overweight with 
Assessment report

Page 61/66 
 
 
 
 
 
comorbidities category at baseline, the benefit/risk ratio cannot be determined. Therefore, an indication 
in overweight adolescents with comorbidities is not acceptable. The final agreed indication is worded 
accordingly. 
It was doubtful whether the submitted growth charts were well suited to determine the exact BMI that 
corresponds to overweight or obesity for a given age. The graphs were small and difficult to read. Now, 
tables are used instead of graphs.  
Fourteen out of 15 subjects not ending on the maximum semaglutide dose had a relevant weight loss, 
and one subject had an increase in bodyweight (increase in 6.6%). The reduction in BMI ranges from 
14.9% to 41.1%. Nine of the 15 subjects reached the maximum dose of 2.4 mg and thereafter decreased 
the dose stepwise to 1.7 mg, 1.0 mg or 0.5 mg. Based on those data no minimum dose should be stated 
in the SmPC.  
Beneficial effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo were observed for all lipid parameters from baseline 
to week 68. The estimated treatment ratios (ETRs) were statistically significant in favour of semaglutide 
2.4 mg for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides. However, the estimates 
were not multiplicity adjusted; hence, the beneficial findings in terms of ETRs are regarded as exploratory 
only. 
4.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Of the 201 subjects randomised 2:1 to treatment, 200 were exposed to the trial product: 133 subjects in 
the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (181.8 PYE, 192.0 PYO); 67 subjects in the placebo group (90.4 PYE, 94.0 
PYO). 
Overall, 89.6% completed treatment and 97.5% of subjects completed the trial. Comparable proportions 
of subjects in both treatment groups completed treatment (89.6% for both treatment groups) and 
completed the trial (98.5% semaglutide 2.4 mg group; 95.5% placebo group). 
Adverse events 
The proportion of subjects with AEs, was comparable between the treatment groups (78.9% in 
semaglutide 2.4 mg vs 82.1% in placebo). The rate of AEs reported was higher with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
than with placebo (435.7 events per 100 PYE in semaglutide 2.4 mg vs 362.9 events per 100 PYE in 
placebo). As expected, this was driven primarily by GI AEs. 
In both treatment groups, most AEs were reported within the first 20 weeks following randomisation. Few 
(24) SAEs were reported during the on-treatment period, 17 in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 7 in 
the placebo group.  
Serious adverse events 
Both the proportion of subjects with SAEs (11.3% vs 9.0%), and the rates of reporting SAEs (9.4 vs 7.7 
events per 100 PYE) were comparable between semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo. Most of the events, in 
both treatment groups, were moderate in severity, and the subjects recovered. 
GI adverse events 
GI disorders were reported by a higher proportion of subjects, and at a higher rate, in the semaglutide 
2.4 mg group compared to placebo (61.7%, 211.8 events per 100 PYE vs 41.8%, 106.2 events per 100 
PYE). In both the semaglutide 2.4 mg and the placebo groups, the majority of GI AEs were non-serious, 
mild or moderate in severity, and had a median duration of 2-3 days. Comparable proportions of events 
in both groups led to permanent treatment discontinuation (2.3% semaglutide 2.4 mg: 1.5% placebo)

and temporary interruption of trial product (5.3% semaglutide 2.4 mg: 4.5% placebo). A greater 
proportion of GI AEs in the semaglutide group (9.8%) compared to placebo (1.5%) led to dose reduction. 
Gall bladder 
Six events of acute gall bladder disease were reported in 5 subjects (3.8%) in the semaglutide 2.4 mg 
group, which is included in the paediatric section of the label. It should be noted that the frequency is 
numerically higher than what has been observed in adult studies, 3.8% in children and 1.6% in adults.  
Other significant adverse events  
Mental health questionnaires (the PHQ-9 and C-SSRS) showed no relevant differences between 
semaglutide and placebo. 
No clinically relevant safety findings were identified in relation to haematology, biochemistry, hormones, 
lipids, or calcitonin. Although there were greater increases in both amylase and lipase from baseline in 
the semaglutide 2.4 mg group compared to placebo, the mean values remained within normal reference 
ranges throughout the treatment period. Increases in amylase and lipase are consistent with the safety 
profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg in adult populations, where they were similarly not seen as predictive of 
acute pancreatitis.  
During the treatment period, the mean pulse was higher in the semaglutide 2.4 mg compared with the 
placebo group. This is similar to the increase in pulse in adults. 
There were no clinically relevant effects of semaglutide on hypoglycaemia in patients with diabetes.  
In addition to body measurement, growth and development were evaluated by assessing height SDS, 
bone age, bone metabolism biomarkers, Tanner pubertal stage, and pituitary-gonadal hormones. No 
clinically relevant treatment differences were noted in any of the growth and development parameters. 
4.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Hepatic adverse events 
A total of 14 hepatic AEs were reported: 13 events in 10 subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 
one event in one subject in the placebo group. The proportion of subjects reporting events, and the event 
rate, were higher in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (7.5%, 7.2 per 100 PYE) than with placebo (1.5%, 1.1 
per 100 PYE). Notably, a greater proportion of subjects with pre-existing hepatic disorders were 
randomised to the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (18.7%, 25 subjects) than with placebo (11.9%, 8 
subjects) and 4 of the AEs were reported at randomisation. 
In STEP Teens, mean levels of ALT decreased -23% in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group as opposed to a 4% 
increase in the placebo group. Mean AST levels decreased -13% in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and -
4.0% in the placebo group. This was a supportive secondary end point. 
The higher proportion of hepatic AEs reported in subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group in STEP Teens 
is maybe partly related to the greater proportion of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group with 
hepatic disorders in their medical histories than in the placebo group.  
In addition, there is an overall mean improvement in liver enzyme levels in subjects randomised to 
semaglutide 2.4 mg. In combination with the clinical and non-clinical evidence from both the adult 
semaglutide 2.4 mg programmes and the GLP-1 RA drug class, there are no hepatic safety concerns 
related to the treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg in the adolescent population.

4.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
4.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The effect of semaglutide on body weight management in adolescents was clinically relevant. However, a 
large proportion of patients (27.5%) did not reach relevant body weight loss. In order to prevent 
unnecessary long-term treatment of this subgroup of young individuals, a stopping rule in adolescents of 
5% is included as requested. With the 5% cut-off value, the lowest proportion of misclassified subjects 
(false responders and false non-responders) is observed, where 7 subjects are misclassified as 
responders and 8 subjects are misclassified as non-responders.  It could be argued that a higher 
threshold could achieve a higher yield, but it is a threshold that is generally accepted in the professional 
domain. 
As only one subject was within the overweight with comorbidities category at baseline, a positive 
benefit/risk could not be established in overweight subjects. Therefore, an indication in overweight 
adolescents with comorbidities is not acceptable. This is in line with the adolescent indication for Saxenda 
(liraglutide). Overweight adolescents with comorbidities were not included in the clinical trial with 
liraglutide, and liraglutide does not have an indication for overweight adolescents with comorbidities. 
In general, the safety and tolerability data from STEP Teens are comparable with the safety profile 
established in the adult clinical development programmes with semaglutide 2.4 mg and other GLP 1 RAs.  
As expected, the most frequently reported AEs with semaglutide 2.4 mg in adolescent subjects were GI-
related AEs. The higher incidence of cholelithiasis in populations with obesity and rapid, significant weight 
loss is well known and is included in the appropriate sections of the product information.

4.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In general, the effect of semaglutide on body weight management in teens was clinically relevant. The 
safety and tolerability data from STEP Teens are comparable with the safety profile established in the 
adult clinical development programmes with semaglutide 2.4 mg and other GLP 1 RAs.  
A large proportion of patients (27.5%) did not reach relevant body weight loss. Based on the data 
provided by the Applicant, inclusion of a stopping rule of 5% in the SmPC is warranted and is now 
implemented in the SmPC. In addition, as only one subject was within the overweight with comorbidities 
category at baseline, an indication in overweight adolescents with comorbidities is not acceptable and the 
indication has been worded accordingly. 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
4.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
4.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Wegovy is positive.

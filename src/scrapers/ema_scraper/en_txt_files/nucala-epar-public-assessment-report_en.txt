1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant GlaxoSmithKline Trading Services submitted on 3 November 2014 an application for 
Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Nucala, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004.  
Mepolizumab, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/13/1116 on 6 February 2013 for 
the treatment of Churg-Strauss Syndrome and as orphan medicinal product EU/3/04/213 on 4 July 
2004 for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Orphan designation was not in place for 
the applied indication.  
The applicant applied for the following indication “as an add-on treatment for severe eosinophilic 
asthma in adult patients identified by either a blood eosinophil count ≥150 cells/μl at initiation of 
treatment or a blood eosinophil count ≥300 cells/μl in the prior 12 months, with a history of 
exacerbations and/or dependency on systemic corticosteroids.” 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that mepolizumab was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
EMEA-C2-000069-PIP02-10-M04 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Asthma is a chronic heterogeneous lung disease characterised by inflammation, narrowing of the 
airways, and reversible airway obstruction. The majority of patients with asthma can be adequately 
controlled by following step-wise treatment recommendations of both the American Thoracic Society 
[ATS, 2014] and Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA, 2014]. However, a small minority of patients 
experience uncontrolled asthma despite attempts to control their disease following these 
recommendations (e.g., high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus additional controller medications). This 
group of high-risk patients suffers from frequent exacerbations, limited control of symptoms, and 
compromised quality of life. Exacerbations are particularly disabling for the patient and typically 
require treatment with high doses of systemic corticosteroids and may require hospital admission. 
Although patients with uncontrolled severe asthma represent less than 5% of the total asthma 
population [Barnes, 1996], these patients experience considerable morbidity [Polosa, 2008] and are 
responsible for approximately 50% of total health care costs associated with asthma [Cisternas, 2003]. 
Evidence shows that patients with severe asthma are comprised of complex, overlapping and non-
overlapping phenotypes, including a severe eosinophilic asthma phenotype [Chung, 2014]. Studies in 
the severe asthma population have shown that more than half of these patients have persistent 
eosinophilic airway inflammation despite corticosteroid therapy [Wenzel, 2005]. Eosinophilic 
inflammation of the airways plays a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma [Cohn, 2004]. 
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) production and eosinophilic inflammation are promoted by T helper 2 (Th2) 
cytokines such as IL-5, and to a lesser extent IL-4, and IL-13. 
Corticosteroids are considered the most effective anti-inflammatory treatments for all severities of 
persistent asthma. The American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) Task Force 
[Chung, 2014] for severe asthma recommends that control should first be attempted through the use 
of high-dose ICS before adding daily oral corticosteroids (OCS) or omalizumab (for the subgroup of 
patients with elevated IgE and who are allergic to a perennial allergen). 
Use of OCS on a regular basis has well-documented side effects. Short-term effects of OCS therapy 
include increased risk of glaucoma, fluid retention, increased blood pressure, mood swings, and weight 
gain. With long-term use of OCS, there is increased risk of cataracts, diabetes, infections, 
osteoporosis, fractures, menstrual irregularities, suppressed adrenal gland hormone production, and 
skin thinning [Manson, 2009]. For these reasons, physicians and patients are reluctant to use OCS on 
a regular basis to control their asthma and even short-term to treat exacerbations.  
Omalizumab, a recombinant humanised mAb (IgG1) is recommended for use in GINA Step 5 (add-on 
treatment for allergic asthma), but only a small proportion of patients with severe asthma are 
appropriate candidates for its use based on specific weight and IgE levels in addition to a positive test 
for a perennial allergen. When the omalizumab label criteria are applied to the severe eosinophilic 
asthma population, there is a 30% overlap with the mepolizumab target population. 
Studies using existing steroid-sparing treatments such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and oral gold 
have demonstrated variable and marginal effects on OCS reduction and significant toxicity. Use of 
these agents is not recommended in the current guidelines because of their high risk/benefit ratio 
[GINA, 2013]. In addition, due to the undesirable safety profile of OCS and the limited application of 
omalizumab in severe asthma [Normansell, 2014], there are few treatment options to reduce the 
frequency of exacerbations and the dependence on systemic corticosteroids for patients with severe

Page 8/101 
 
 
 
 
 
eosinophilic asthma. Thus, there remains a high unmet need to provide better treatment options, 
without the side effects associated with systemic corticosteroids, for this small segment of the asthma 
population. 
Mepolizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal IgG (IgG1 kappa) antibody which binds with 
high specificity and affinity to human interleukin 5 (hIL-5), preventing it from binding to the alpha 
chain of the IL-5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibiting IL-5 
signalling. IL-5 has been identified as the key cytokine responsible for regulation of blood and tissue 
eosinophils (the growth and differentiation, recruitment, activation and survival of eosinophils). . The 
overproduction of IL-5 in the airways has been specifically reported in patients with eosinophil-
associated asthma [Robinson, 1992; Sur, 1995]. By targeting IL-5, mepolizumab prevents IL-5 from 
binding to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and 
thus inhibits IL-5 signalling and the overexpression of peripheral blood and tissue eosinophils. 
However, complete blood eosinopenia is not possible due to redundant signalling by IL-3 and 
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) through a common β-sub-unit [Asquith, 
2008]. In addition, available data do not indicate that reduction of eosinophils has any untoward 
effects on normal health [Gleich, 2013]; patients lacking eosinophils in association with 
immunodeficiency or as a consequence of IgG-mediated eosinophil precursor destruction do not display 
any distinguishing abnormalities related to the eosinophil reduction. 
The current Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) is a re-submission which had a different 
proposed indication (hyperesoniphphilic syndrome (HES)) and it was withdrawn by the same applicant 
during the assessment procedure  
(http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Application_withdrawal_assessment_repor
t/2010/01/WC500060631.pdf). The development of mepolizumab has targeted a number of indications 
associated with hypereosinophilia. This application is the first mepolizumab submission for severe 
eosinophilic asthma 
The CHMP gave scientific advice on the development of mepolizumab for asthma three times regarding 
various aspects of the clinical trials design of the placebo-controlled phase IIb/III (e.g. eligibility of 
subjects, safety database, strategy to recruit patients, proposed statistical plan, target patient 
population, immunogenicity assessment, etc.). The scientific advice was largely followed.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Mepolizumab is a humanised monoclonal IgG (IgG1 kappa) antibody, which is produced in Chinese 
hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology (SmPC section 2) and binds with high specificity 
and affinity to soluble human interleukin 5 (IL-5), the key cytokine responsible for regulation of blood 
and tissue eosinophils. This IL-5 binding results in the inhibition of IL-5 signalling. 
The product is presented as a sterile lyophilised white powder for solution for injection in Type I clear 
glass vials. Each vial contains 100 mg mepolizumab formulated with sodium phosphate dibasic 
heptahydrate, sucrose and polysorbate 80. After reconstitution with 1.2 mL of sterile water for 
injections, each mL of solution contains 100 mg mepolizumab (SmPC section 6). The vials are sealed 
with rubber stoppers and secured with aluminium overseals that have plastic flip-off caps.

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
Mepolizumab is an IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody consisting of two heavy and two light chains 
containing 449 aminoacids (49 kDa) and 220 amino acids (24 kDa) each, respectively. The heavy and 
light chains are covalently linked by a single disulfide bond and the heavy chains are linked to each 
other by two disulfide bonds resulting in a typical IgG molecule. Both heavy chains are glycosylated at 
asparagine 299 with complex biantennary oligosaccharides. The carbohydrate molecular mass is 
approximately 3 kDa resulting in a total estimated molecular mass of 149 kDa for mepolizumab. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The commercial manufacturing process, designated as MDS2, is a standard antibody production 
process consisting of upstream cell fermentation in CHO cells and downstream purification; altogether 
12 production stages have been identified for the active substance manufacture. Mepolizumab active 
substance is manufactured at GlaxoSmithkline LLC, 893 River Road, Conshohocken, PA 19428, USA.  
The fermentation process starts with a seed train and gradual expansion over 3 stages and eventual 
seed into a batch fermentation tank. Mepolizumab is then separated from cell debris through the 
harvest procedure. 
The purification is a multi-step process that involves several chromatography steps, virus inactivation 
stepsand virus filtration. The resultant filtrate is formulated by concentration and diafiltration using 
tangential flow ultrafiltration (TFUF). Mepolizumab bulk undergoes filtration and is dispensed into 
containers, frozen and stored until transported to the finished product manufacturing site under 
validated shipment conditions. 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the active substance manufacturing process is given.  
Development genetics and cell banking system 
The cloning of the plasmids and generation of the cell lines has been described. The complementarity 
determining regions (CDRs) were grafted from the murine antibody, which was generated through the 
immunisation of mice with recombinant human IL-5. The sequence was humanised at several residues 
and the heavy and light chain vectors were fully sequenced. The plasmids were transfected in a 
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line which was adapted for serum-free growth.  
Single colonies were selected and a master cell bank (MCB) was generated. Two working cell banks 
(WCB), prepared from the MCB, are currently in use and the applicant has stated that once the older 
WCB is depleted, the new WCB will be used for commercial supply. Comparability of both WCBs has 
been demonstrated and a protocol is in place for qualification of future WCBs. Comprehensive testing 
of both the MCB and WCB has been carried out in accordance with ICH guidelines and the cell lines 
have been shown to be free of viral contamination. Genetic stability has been demonstrated on cells at 
the limit of in vitro cell age and the stability of the production cell line from MCB to harvest has been 
demonstrated. 
Process validation 
The applicant has followed a three stage approach to process validation in support of the commercial 
manufacturing process for mepolizumab active substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 10/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional studies were also conducted to support validation of the commercial manufacturing process. 
These studies included resin and membrane lifetime and reuse, in-process product hold times, 
reprocessing, characterisation of the freezing process for the active substance and qualification of the 
active substance shipping procedure. 
Manufacturing process development 
Mepolizumab active substance was initially manufactured using a pilot scale bioreactor. This material 
was used for pre-clinical and Phase I/II clinical studies. The process was then scaled-up to a larger 
production bioreactor with a few minor changes and the material was used for clinical studies. 
Manufacture was subsequently moved to GSK LLC, Conshohocken and scaled up to a production 
bioreactor with a few minor changes. The active substance produced in GSK LLC, Conshohocken was 
used for clinical studies and to generate reference standard  which has been designated as the Primary 
Reference Standard (PRS). Further modifications were made to the active substance manufacturing 
process resulting in the intended process for commercial registration. 
Some of the changes introduced into the MDS2 manufacturing process are significant. Changes to the 
cell culture media and bioreactor equipment could impact on growth kinetics, viability and general 
metabolism of the CHO cells, which in turn could impact on the quality of the active substance 
produced. To address these issues the applicant demonstrated process comparability with regard to 
process attributes such as viability, doubling time, passage duration, CHO metabolism and yield. 
Replacement of the cell harvesting equipment is another change which could result in difference in 
active substance purity. Investigations were undertaken to examine if this occurs. The process 
comparability studies were based on results from multiple batches from both process versions and the 
outcome is considered satisfactory. 
Development of control strategy 
The control strategy for mepolizumab active substance manufacture includes control of raw materials 
and excipients, procedural controls, process parameter controls, process monitoring, in-process 
testing, release testing and characterisation testing. It was developed using a risk-based approach 
applied with product, process and facility knowledge. The resulting combination of process controls and 
product testing is in place to ensure product quality and patient safety.  
Characterisation 
a) Elucidation of structure and other characteristics 
Full characterisation of mepolizumab PRS  was performed using a range of biochemical, biophysical, 
biological and immunoassays to confirm the identity, purity and potency of the molecule. 
•  Physicochemical characterisation 
The following tests were performed: 
Primary sequence: Peptides mapping mass spectroscopy, free sulfhydryls content, disulfide 
mapping liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), intact and reduced mass 
were performed. The molecular mass, as well as the heavy and light chain sequences, matched the 
expected sequences based on the cDNA. Low levels of post-translational modifications were 
detected in mepolizumab. The location of the 16 disulfide bonds was confirmed, as well as the lack 
of free sulfhydryls. 
Secondary and tertiary sequence: circular dichroism (near and far UV), Fourier transform infrared 
(FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and mass spectrometry, total carbohydrate content and 
monosaccharide composition by reverse phase HPLC, non-glycosylated heavy chain analysis by 
CGE.  
Purity: CGE (reduced and non-reduced conditions), sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel 
(SDS-PAGE) (reduced and non-reduced conditions), Western blot, size exclusion chromatography

•  Biological characterisation 
Testing was performed for specific binding analysis, kinetic analysis and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) 
binding analysis. 
An in vitro method, neutralisation of IL-5-dependent cell proliferation, was used to determine the 
biological activity of mepolizumab.  
b) Impurities 
Low levels of process-related impurities were observed in the bulk active substance. 
Low levels of product-related impurities and substances are present in mepolizumab bulk active 
substance. The applicant provided detailed information of the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of 
mepolizumab and control strategy used to monitor these attributes. 
Specification 
The proposed commercial specification for the active substance was established in consideration of the 
CQAs of mepolizumab, the cumulative batch release and stability data derived from the MDS1/MDP1 
and MDS2/MDP2 processes, and prior clinical experience.  
The specification for mepolizumab active substance includes controls of identity, purity and impurity, 
potency, quantity, safety and other general tests. The analytical methods used have been adequately 
described and appropriately validated. 
The same product-specific reference standard is used for release and stability testing of mepolizumab 
active substance and finished product. 
Stability 
A shelf life of is applied to mepolizumab bulk active substance when stored under recommended 
conditions in specified containers. Stability data is provided to cover the intended storage period.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Mepolizumab finished product, 100 mg/vial, is a white lyophilised cake, manufactured from a bulk 
active substance solution containing 75 mg/mL mepolizumab, sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate, 
sucrose, and polysorbate 80, at pH 7.0. Mepolizumab finished product is presented in 10 mL Type 1 
clear glass vials, sealed with grey bromobutyl rubber single vent stoppers and aluminium overseals 
with red flip-off caps. After reconstitution with 1.2 mL of sterile water for injections, it forms a clear-to-
opalescent, colourless-to-pale-yellow or pale-brown solution (SmPC section 6). 
Assessment report

Page 12/101 
 
 
 
 
 
The components of the finished product were selected to deliver the quality target product profile 
(QTPP) to ensure product quality and safety. 
During development of mepolizumab finished product, three different presentations were used for early 
clinical phase studies, for Phase 2 and for late phase clinical studies, and for Phase 3 clinical studies 
and proposed commercialisation. 
The qualitative composition of the bulk active substance has not changed throughout clinical 
development. The formulation was optimised to create the formulation used for mepolizumab for 
injection, 100 mg/vial. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured at a cGMP manufacturing facility. The finished product 
manufacturing process intended for commercial supply begins with thawing the bulk active substance 
followed by  mixing, filtration, and filling into washed and depyrogenated 10 mL Type I glass vials. 
After filling, the vials are partially stoppered and transferred into a lyophiliser. After lyophilisation 
aluminium overseals are applied to the vials and the finished product is stored protected from light 
before labelling and packaging. 
The manufacturing process development of mepolizumab 100 mg/vial finished product was based on 
experience gained during the development of the earlier finished product. A technical risk assessment 
was conducted to focus on potential areas that may require change during the manufacturing process 
development of the 100 mg/ vial finished product and where necessary a number of Design of 
Experiment (DoE) studies, engineering studies and proven acceptable ranges (PAR) studies were 
conducted to support these changes.  
Minimal changes were made during development to optimise the process. Commercial process 
validation was conducted to confirm process robustness and reproducibility. The suitability of process 
parameters were tested. The adequacy of the in-process controls was evaluated in order to provide 
assurance that the manufacturing process is designed, controlled and monitored to reliably meet 
mepolizumab for injection, 100 mg/vial finished product quality attributes and specifications.  
Product specification 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
The specification for mepolizumab finished product includes controls of identity, purity, potency, 
quantity, safety and a number other general tests including European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) tests. 
The approach for setting the specification of the finished product is similar to the one applied for the 
active substance. 
Stability of the product 
A 24 month shelf life at storage conditions ≤25°C, do not freeze (SmPC section 6), is applied on the 
basis of stability data generated from stability studies.  
Adventitious agents 
The adventitious agents control strategy includes raw material sourcing and testing, cell bank testing, 
manufacturing process controls (in-process testing adherence to purification protocols and 
establishment of viral clearance) and facility and equipment design and controls. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1

A thorough risk assessment of the MCB and WCBs, active substance and finished product was 
performed. This evaluation included a review of the sourcing and certification of ruminant or human-
derived raw materials used in the manufacturing process and the materials that come into direct 
contact with equipment used during manufacture. Media used in facility and equipment validation 
studies were also included in this evaluation.  
Overall, the TSE contamination risk from the cell banks or the raw materials is considered negligible. 
Viral testing of the MCB, WCBs and end-of-production cell bank (EOPCB) was performed. Taken 
together, viral testing has been carried out in accordance with ICH Q5A. 
Viral clearance studies were carried out. The small-scale models were described and the relationship of 
the model process parameters to the full  scale process parameters was also outlined. Qualification of 
small-scale models was discussed in the dossier. The overall level of viral reduction provides assurance 
of viral safety.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance 
The derivation of the coding sequence and construction of the light and heavy chain expression vectors 
were satisfactorily described. Both plasmids were fully sequenced. 
The preparation of the MCB and WCB is described in detail and the two-tiered cell banking system was 
generated in accordance with ICH Q5 guidelines. The MCB and WCB were sufficiently characterised. An 
EOPCB was created and analysed, confirming absence of adventitious agents and genetic stability. 
Stability (viability) of the MCB and the first WCB were determined. 
The manufacturing process is a standard antibody production process; it was adequately described, 
including reprocessing conditions.  
The applicant gave a full list of raw materials used for the production of mepolizumab. 
The process validation strategy was sufficiently explained. The process was run consistently and met 
acceptance specifications. Impurities clearance was sufficiently demonstrated.  
Hold time validation consisted of microbial safety and biochemical stability. 
The history of process development was given. A satisfactory history for the development changes to 
the purification process was provided. This includes an outline of significant changes between the 
processes. 
Comparability between the processes is considered demonstrated. The approach to analytical 
comparability is accepted and includes data from all different development stages. The applicant has 
shown good process consistency throughout development. 
For the control strategy, the applicant presented a list of CQAs and a gap analysis to determine 
potential risks to product quality. CQAs were identified using product and process knowledge and in the 
context of treatment of severe asthma, the mechanism of action, the molecular properties and the 
manufacturing process. The rationale for the assignment of criticality to quality attributes was 
provided.   
The applicant also presented an overview of the approach to determining the critical process 
parameters (CPPs). Qualified small-scale models and DoEs as well as single parameter experiments 
were used to establish PARs and Normal Operating Ranges (NORs) for all stages of the manufacturing

process. Qualification of the small-scale models was satisfactory and where statistically significant 
differences were observed, these have been sufficiently explained. 
Relevant aspects of the structure of mepolizumab were extensively analysed, using orthogonal 
methods where appropriate.  
Monosaccharide and oligosaccharide profiling was carried out. Product-related impurities were isolated 
and analysed and a suitable control strategy is in place for any manufacturing changes.  
In relation to process-related impurities, batch data and clearance studies support the removal of most 
tests from the specification. The analytical methods were set out with sufficient detail. Over the course 
of mepolizumab development the applicant made changes to a number of analytical procedures. These 
are justified and appropriate bridging studies were carried out. Where differences were observed due 
to transition of methods, these have been adequately explained and taken into account. This is 
acceptable. 
The specifications are based on a statistical analysis of a suitable number of batches and supported by 
clinical qualification. 
Reference standards were sufficiently characterised and the current working reference standard was 
demonstrated as comparable to the primary reference standard. Qualification of new working 
standards was described. 
The description of the container closure system for the active substance includes acceptance controls 
of material and is adequate. 
The proposed shelf life when stored at recommended conditions is considered acceptable. 
Finished product 
The rationale for the selection of excipients in the finished product formulation was given. The 
applicant has given sufficient background information on the formulation development. Justifications 
and supporting data were provided both at the level of the bulk active substance and the lyophilised 
finished product. The history of formulation development for the different concentrations was 
adequately captured. 
The applicant set out details of the manufacturing process development history. The manufacturing 
process consists of filling and lyophilisation without a formulation step (the bulk active substance is 
already formulated). The main change for the development of the 100 mg/mL from the earlier 
formulation was the adjustment of the fill and lyophilisation process. In addition to batch analysis, an 
extended comparability study was undertaken on  commercial scale batches. The data demonstrate 
that the finished product from the two processes is consistent and comparable.  
For the manufacturing process control strategy, the applicant employed an analogous approach to that 
outlined for the active substance.  
The rationale and development of the container closure system was adequately set out. A spectrum of 
potential process leachables was considered and tested for. Where compounds were detected their 
permissible levels were adequately justified. 
Microbiological attributes were sufficiently considered. 
As part of the compatibility studies an in-use stability of up to 8 hours at up to 30°C was established. 
Compatibility with polypropylene syringes for the duration and temperature ranges was also 
demonstrated, as well as suitability of different gauge needles. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 15/101 
 
 
 
 
 
For process validation, data that was submitted suggest the process is consistent. 
Extensive information on the validation of various sterilisation processes was submitted, demonstrating 
that sterility of the process is assured.  
Full shipping validation and analysis was undertaken on the finished fully packaged finished product.  
Information on the transport of the bulk active substance to the finished product manufacturing site 
was also provided.  
All excipients used in the manufacture of the finished product are Ph. Eur or US Pharmacopoeia grade 
and are adequately controlled.  
The analytical procedures were set out and the methods were sufficiently validated.  
Batch analytical data are all within specifications and demonstrate a consistent manufacturing process. 
The approach for setting specifications is analogous to that employed for the active substance and 
based on clinical justification they are considered acceptable.  
The release specifications listed are in accordance with the Ph. Eur. Monograph on Monoclonal 
Antibodies for Human Use (2031). 
A 24 month shelf life is proposed for MDP2 at storage conditions ≤ 250C on the basis of stability data 
generated. The claimed shelf life is considered acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
The applicant set out the approach to the adventitious agents control strategy satisfactorily and in 
accordance with ICH guidelines. Adequate information was provided to support the conclusion that the 
TSE contamination risk is considered negligible. 
Viral clearance studies were undertaken on relevant manufacturing steps. An appropriate panel of 
model viruses was chosen for the clearance studies. Small-scale models were appropriately qualified. 
Results in the summary report indicate sufficient clearance for the process. 
An estimate of the worst case scenario dose risk for the product was given. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Nucala is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply 
with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active substance are adequately 
described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its 
physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily 
described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications.  
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently 
assured. 
The overall quality of Nucala is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended several points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical development programme was designed in accordance with the guidance provided in 
ICH S6 R1) “Pre-clinical safety evaluation of biotechnology – derived pharmaceuticals” 
(CPMP/ICH/302/95, March 1998).  
Most of the non-clinical studies were performed using mepolizumab, with the definitive in vivo studies 
conducted in cynomolgus monkeys as this is the only species commonly used for non-clinical 
toxicology studies in which mepolizumab has been shown to be pharmacologically active. However, 
assessments of male and female fertility and embryofoetal development, and an immunotoxicity study 
were conducted in mice using SB-264091, a rat homologous anti-human IL-5 monoclonal antibody 
(IgG2b) that is pharmacologically active in this species.  
GLP 
Safety pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP) regulations. All pivotal toxicity studies were performed in accordance with GLP. Other 
studies were performed in accordance with accepted scientific practice and in general agreement with 
the principles of GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacology of mepolizumab was characterised using predominantly in vitro studies investigating 
binding affinities, species specificity and effects on cell proliferation. The ability of mepolizumab to 
reduce levels of circulating eosinophils has also been examined in a range of in vivo pharmacodynamic 
and toxicity studies and in animal models of asthma and parasitic infection.  Binding to human tissues 
(immunohistology) was investigated in a panel of thirty-one tissues.   
A high resolution crystal structure for mepolizumab Fab fragments bound to recombinant IL-5 was 
determined in an in-vitro study. The steric hindrance by the full mepolizumab antibody was reported to 
inhibit the binding of hIL-5 to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain.  In another in- vitro study, mepolizumab 
inhibited the proliferation of monkey and human bone marrow cells equipotently when stimulated by 
rhIL-5 (IC50 was 70 to 116 pM). 
Mepolizumab was observed to inhibit three forms of rhIL-5 (derived from Drosophila, HEK293 and CHO 
cells) with similar half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in each cell line in a study using the 
erythroleukaemic human cell line TF-12.8.  These results suggested that the level and type of 
glycosylation on rhIL-5 was not important for the pharmacologic activity of mepolizumab. 
Mepolizumab had high affinity and high specificity for human IL-5 (hIL-5), but also recognised monkey 
IL-5. Biacore analysis showed that mepolizumab bound to IL-5 with a Kd of ≤ 100 pM, and with an 
estimated off-rate of 1.7x10-5 s-1 and an on-rate of 1.6x105M-1s-1. A subsequent, more sensitive 
Biacore assay suggested an even higher affinity (Kd of 4.2 pM). In another study, the affinity for 
human IL-5 was shown to be very high, ranging from 110 to 258 pM at 25oC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 17/101 
 
 
 
 
 
Stoichiometric analysis using titration microcalorimetry showed a 1:1 ratio of IL-5 to antibody and high 
affinity of mepolizumab for IL-5 (<130 pM at 25°C).  Analytical ultracentrifugation, which measured IL-
5 in its native homodimer format, showed a ratio of two mepolizumab antibodies bound to two IL-5 
homodimers.  
Mepolizumab was shown to neutralise up to 90% of IL-5 mediated cell proliferation in a human 
erythroleukaemic cell line (TF1.28) and in murine pre-B-cells (B13) with IC50 values of 100 to 150 pM 
respectively.  
In vivo pharmacological activity of mepolizumab was assessed in the toxicology studies and was 
measured as a reduction in circulating eosinophils, with a decrease greater than 89-94% in basal 
eosinophil counts observed following the first dose of mepolizumab in monkeys receiving mepolizumab 
doses of ≥ 5 mg/kg. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed by the applicant, which the CHMP considered 
acceptable given the nature of mepolizumab. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In monkeys, no acute effects of mepolizumab were observed on cardiovascular, respiratory and renal 
functions or on body temperature after single intravenous doses of up to 100 mg/kg in a single safety 
pharmacology study. 
Mepolizumab binding was demonstrated using immunohistochemistry to be restricted to human 
lymphoid tissues, suggesting little likelihood for non-pharmacological effects. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed by the applicant, which the CHMP considered 
acceptable given the nature mepolizumab. . 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetic properties of mepolizumab were investigated in the cynomolgus 
monkey as part of the single and repeat dose toxicity studies at doses up to 304 mg/kg using the same 
dose route (intravenous). 
Conventional studies of distribution, metabolism and excretion were not conducted by the applicant 
because mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody. 
Following a single intravenous administration of mepolizumab to monkeys, plasma concentrations 
declined in a bi-exponential manner with a long terminal half-life of approximately 2 weeks. The 
plasma clearance and volume of distribution were low (0.157 mL/h/kg and 65.6 mL/kg, respectively). 
The intravenous pharmacokinetic profile was similar for monkeys and humans.  There were no marked 
differences in the pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab between male and female monkeys. Plasma 
concentrations were observed to increase with subsequent doses of mepolizumab, reaching a plateau 
after the fourth dose.   
Bioavailability of mepolizumab was essentially 100% following subcutaneous administration at either 1 
or 10 mg/kg. The terminal half-life (~15 days) was similar to that observed following intravenous 
administration.  No notable accumulation (i.e. ≥2-fold) of mepolizumab was observed following once-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 18/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monthly repeat subcutaneous administration for 6 months in the chronic toxicity study and no sex 
differences were observed.   
Following intravenous administration, mepolizumab crossed the monkey placenta and was generally 
quantifiable in infant plasma samples between the first post-partum sampling time on Day 14 and the 
Day 91 post-partum sample. Infant plasma concentrations of mepolizumab were on average 2.4-fold 
higher than maternal plasma concentrations.  Mepolizumab was not quantifiable in maternal milk 
samples obtained from monkeys given doses of 10 mg/kg but was quantifiable on Day 14 in 6 of 7 
females given doses of 100 mg/kg.   
In a metabolism study using cultured human hepatocytes, exposure to mepolizumab for 48 hours 
produced no notable changes in the mRNA levels of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). At concentrations 
≥1000 pg/mL, IL-5 and IL-6 decreased CYP3A4 mRNA levels by ≥69 and 77%, respectively.   
In general, pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that mepolizumab exposure was not limited by 
development of immune antibody responses and that formation of anti-mepolizumab antibodies was 
accompanied by a faster clearance of mepolizumab from systemic circulation and also by a lower 
decrease in eosinophil counts.  
In a study in mice using SB-264091, plasma concentrations of SB-264091increased with increasing 
dose from 5 to 50 mg/kg and were quantifiable over the 29 day sampling period.  Considerable inter-
animal variability was observed and the majority of these differences could be attributed to the 
presence of anti-SB-264091 antibodies. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The applicant conducted an abbreviated toxicity programme with mepolizumab, in only one species, 
the cynomolgus monkey, and at two doses in the pivotal studies.  The choice of the cynomolgus 
monkey was justified on the basis of cross-reactivity with monkey IL-5.  The CHMP accepted that other 
standard laboratory species would not have been suitable and that the doses chosen for the pivotal 
toxicity studies were adequate.  Developmental and reproductive toxicity studies were conducted with 
mepolizumab in the cynomolgus monkey and in mice using SB 264091.   
The toxicology programme consisted of single and repeat dose toxicity studies of up to 6 months’ 
duration in cynomolgus monkeys, reproductive toxicology studies in mice and monkeys (a fertility and 
embryofetal development and a pre- and post-natal development study, respectively), and studies 
investigating antigenicity, immunotoxicity and local tolerance. 
Single dose toxicity 
In a single-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, mepolizumab was administered in intravenous 
dose of 0, 3.0 or 304 mg/kg mepolizumab and monitored for one month. Mepolizumab was observed 
to be well tolerated with only an expected decrease in circulating eosinophil counts and there were no 
drug-related pathologic findings. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In intravenous repeat dose studies of up to 6 months’ duration, mepolizumab was well tolerated with 
no toxicity being found and no target organs identified.  There was no delayed toxicity and acceptable 
local tolerance was demonstrated. The principal effect observed in toxicology studies of up to 6 months 
duration was related to the pharmacology of mepolizumab and was reversible following the cessation 
of treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 19/101 
 
 
 
 
 
Intravenous and subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab to monkeys significantly decreased 
basal levels of circulating eosinophils and blocked blood eosinophilia resulting from rhIL-2 
administration.  The magnitude of the observed decreases was generally similar across the effective 
doses (≥  5 mg/kg), with the major difference being in the duration of the decreases in eosinophil 
counts.  Following clearance of mepolizumab from the circulation, eosinophil counts returned to pre-
study levels.   
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were conducted by the applicant. The CHMP considered it 
acceptable as mepolizumab is a recombinant protein. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and embryo-foetal development were investigated using SB-264091 (0.5 or 50 mg/kg) 
administered once weekly to male and female CD-1 mice.  There was no investigation of littering or 
functional post-natal development. There was no effect observed on mating, fertility, gonadal function, 
or early embryonic or embryo-foetal development. The study despite not providing direct information 
for the risk assessment of mepolizumab did provide supporting evidence that blockade of IL-5 does not 
appear to have any effects on fertility and foetal morphology in mice.   
Pre- and postnatal developments were investigated in cynomolgus monkeys.  There were no effects on 
pregnancy, embryo-foetal development or immune development in offspring however no examinations 
to detect visceral or skeletal malformations were conducted. 
Toxicokinetic analysis of the pre-and postnatal study confirmed exposure of the monkeys to sustained 
serum concentrations of mepolizumab.  Exposures higher than that in humans were obtained with 
safety margins of 4.72 and 30.9 in the 10 and 100 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. The no observed 
adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for adults and offspring were both >100 mg/kg with a mean Cmax of 
1.159 mg/ml and an AUC of 254.1 mg.h/ml in the adults.  
Mepolizumab was observed to cross the placental barrier in monkeys but the teratogenic potential of 
mepolizumab was not studied in the pre and post-natal study in monkeys and remains unknown. This 
was reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC: Mepolizumab crosses the placental barrier in monkey. Animal 
studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity. The potential for harm to a human foetus is unknown. 
A precautionary statement was also included in section 4.6 of the SmPC: As a precautionary measure, 
it is preferable to avoid the use of Nucala during pregnancy. Administration of Nucala to pregnant 
women should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible 
risk to the foetus. 
Additional a pregnancy surveillance study (category 3) was included in the pharmacovigilance plan of 
the RMP to evaluate to evaluate pregnancy outcomes and birth defects. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The NOAEL for monkeys in the 6 month study was >100 mg/kg with a mean C max of 2.4 mg/mL and 
AUC of 809 mg.h/mL at the end of the study.  This exposure in monkeys represented a 70-fold 
multiple of the human mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneous exposure. The CHMP considered this 
acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 20/101 
 
 
 
 
 
Local Tolerance  
In repeated dose toxicity studies in monkeys, mepolizumab was generally well tolerated following 
intravenous and subcutaneous administrations. Therefore, no special local tolerance studies with 
mepolizumab were required.  
Immunogenicity 
Mepolizumab was only weakly immunogenic in the range of toxicology studies conducted in monkeys. 
Mepolizumab was demonstrated to bind to human lymphoid tissues.  In the intravenous studies, only 
3% of the animals generated anti-drug antibodies, which resulted in an enhanced systemic clearance 
of mepolizumab and in no adverse reactions. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The guidance on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(CHMP/SWP/4447/00) specifically exempts amino acids, peptides and proteins from the need for a 
detailed environmental assessment.  
Therefore, in compliance with this guidance, an environmental risk assessment for mepolizumab (a 
recombinant protein) was not considered necessary by the CHMP.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical development programme for mepolizumab consisted of a range of pharmacodynamic, 
pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies, in which the activity of mepolizumab was investigated in vitro 
and in vivo. Mepolizumab recognised human IL-5 with high affinity and specificity, and inhibited 
binding of IL-5 to its receptor (IL-5 receptor α) with an IC50 of <1.0 nM. 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies or pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies were 
conducted by the applicant. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
The safety pharmacology of mepolizumab was addressed in a single study on the CNS, renal and 
respiratory function. Cardiovascular function was monitored in a 6 month toxicity study in monkeys.  
Pharmacokinetic studies detailed the absorption, distribution and metabolism profile of mepolizumab. 
In the toxicity studies, mepolizumab was given intravenously and subcutaneously (the same route of 
administration used clinically). The non-clinical PK profile of mepolizumab has been studied in rats, 
rabbits and monkeys. Mepolizumab exhibited a low volume of distribution in monkeys and humans. 
Low concentrations of mepolizumab were detected in bronchalveolar lavage samples.  
In a reproduction and development study, high levels of mepolizumab were shown to cross the 
placenta and low levels were detected in milk. In a metabolism study using cultured hepatocytes, at 
concentrations of ≥1000 pg/ml, IL-5 and IL-6 reduced CYP3A4 mRNA levels by ≥69 and 77%, 
respectively. 
The maximum duration of treatment in toxicity studies was 6 months, which is in compliance with ICH 
S6 and thus supported the intended chronic, monthly administration to patients. Studies of a longer 
duration would not be expected to provide additional information to that predicted from the 
pharmacology of IL-5, either through inhibition with a monoclonal antibody antagonist or through 
genetic disruption (IL-5 knockout models), and there was no evidence to suggest a risk for long-term 
suppression of IL-5 in patients receiving mepolizumab. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 21/101 
 
 
 
 
 
In monkeys, single or monthly repeated intravenous doses of up to 304 or 100 mg/kg mepolizumab, 
respectively, resulted in decreased peripheral blood eosinophil with no evidence of toxicological effects.  
No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were conducted by the applicant. This was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
The antagonism of IL-5 had no effect on reproductive function, pregnancy or development of the 
offspring in a fertility and early embryonic/embryofoetal development assessment of SB-264091 (≤50 
mg/kg) in mice and a pre- and postnatal development study with mepolizumab (≤100 mg/kg) in 
monkeys. However, mepolizumab crosses the placental barrier and the teratogenic potential of 
mepolizumab was not studied in the monkey pre and post-natal study.  
An embryofoetal development study was conducted in mice and not in monkeys. Although anti-SB-
264091 antibodies were evident in mice, exposure was not directly quantified in the mouse 
embryofetal development study. The potential for masking of embryo-foetal toxicity due to insufficient 
drug exposure was considered unlikely. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The effect of mepolizumab on human pregnancy is unknown; hence, mepolizumab should only be 
administered if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risks to the foetus. This was 
reflected appropriately in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
In local tolerance evaluations, intravenous or subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab was well 
tolerated. In an immunohistochemistry study, mepolizumab binding was restricted to human lymphoid 
tissues, indicating little likelihood of non-pharmacologically mediated effects. Administration of 
mepolizumab to monkeys resulted in a very low incidence of immunogenicity. The weight of evidence 
for mepolizumab suggests that the risk for potential immunotoxicity is low.  
Overall, the non-clinical data has been adequately reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The review of non-clinical data available for mepolizumab has provided adequate characterisation of 
primary pharmacological and toxicological properties of the compound. The in vitro and in vivo 
pharmacodynamic studies indicated that mepolizumab had an inhibitory effect on IL-5. 
The applicant conducted a satisfactory programme of pharmacology studies and the CHMP considered 
that further studies were not required.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
The pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab were previously characterised as part of the evaluation of 
Bosatria, which was proposed to be indicated for hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) 
(http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Application_withdrawal_assessment_repor
t/2010/01/WC500060631.pdf). For the current submission two new clinical pharmacology studies, one 
in healthy subjects (MEA 115705) and one in asthmatic subjects with elevated blood eosinophil levels 
(MEA 114092) were submitted. In addition, three clinical Phase IIb/III efficacy studies in severe 
eosinophilic asthma patients (MEA 112997, MEA 115588 and MEA 115575) were submitted, 
contributing to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic data to characterise the PK profile of 
mepolizumab in this target population. Sparse PK samples were collected and analysed using 
population PK methods.  
A previous PopPK model was resubmitted and an updated model including the data of the new studies 
submitted in the application for severe eosinophilic asthma was presented during the procedure. 
The measurement of mepolizumab plasma concentrations in support of clinical studies was carried out 
by validated bioanalytical immunoassay methods with a Lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 50 
ng/mL and a range of 50 – 5000 ng/mL.  
The relevant studies submitted in this application for the PK/PD evaluation are displayed in Table 10 
(which provides an overview of the new clinical pharmacology studies) and Table 9 which includes an 
overview of the new clinical efficacy and safety studies contributing to the pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic data (MEA 112997, MEA115588 and MEA115575).

The analyses of PK data from the Phase II and III studies in moderate/severe eosinophilic asthma were 
based on an initial population PK meta-analysis of IV mepolizumab developed using data from multiple 
studies in healthy subjects and in a range of diseases (asthma, HES, eosinophilic oesophagitis). This 
initial population PK meta-analysis of IV mepolizumab was previously part of the evaluation of 
Bosatria.  
This initial Population PK (PopPK) meta-analysis of IV mepolizumab included a total of 327 subjects, 
45% female, 55% male with average age of 37 years (range 18–74) and average weight of 76.1 kg. 
Ethnicity breakdown was 86% Caucasian, 10% Black, 2.7% other, and less than 1% East and South 
East Asian and South Asian. 
The analysis was performed using the non-linear mixed effects modelling program NONMEM system. 
Estimates for population mean, Standard Errors (SE) and relative SE (%) of parameters, inter-
individual variability and residual variability were obtained. A structural PK model was developed based 
on review of the known plausible pharmacology of mepolizumab. The covariate model was then 
developed using forward addition, followed by backward elimination. 
The pharmacokinetics of IV mepolizumab was well-described by a two-compartment model with first-
order elimination. The final structural model included the following pharmacokinetic parameters: 
Clearance (CL), central volume of distribution (V1), inter-compartmental clearance (Q), and peripheral 
volume of distribution (V2).  
Twelve covariates (weight, height, age, sex, race, country of study site, disease state, creatinine 
clearance, and liver function [alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin]) were investigated. Bodyweight was the only statistically significant 
covariate for clearance and volume, although the magnitude of effect was not considered to be 
clinically relevant. Renal function (creatinine clearance) and hepatic function had no effect. However, 
the majority of values were within normal range and extrapolation was therefore limited. 
Within this submission a new analysis of the PK data from the Phase II and III studies in 
moderate/severe eosinophilic asthma was submitted. One, study MEA112997, used the parameter 
values from the meta-analysis without updating. The other analyses (studies MEA114092, MEA115588 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 25/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and MEA115575) included SC drug administration (+/- IV dosing). For these analyses, SC data were 
modelled independently, IV parameter values were updated and a different parameterisation of the 
impact of body weight on clearance and volume of distribution was used (fixed rather than fitted 
allometric exponents). Uncertainty in parameter estimates was assessed by standard error estimates.   
During the procedure the CHMP requested an updated POPPKPD model that integrated both 
intravenous and subcutaneous data. Typical goodness of fit graphics and visual predictive check were 
used for model evaluation. Nonlinear mixed-effect modelling was used with the aid of NONMEM and 
other packages (WinBUGS, Monolix, SAS) where appropriate. 
The analyses were conducted mainly to allow calculation of individual subject exposure parameters to 
be used in exposure-response analyses or individual concentration-time profiles to be used in PKPD 
analysis. The analyses were also used to identify important patient characteristics that might require 
dosage adjustment. 
The covariate model selection procedure involved graphical evaluation, regression analysis, followed by 
forward addition (p≤ 0.05) and backward elimination (p≤ 0.01). The covariates tested varied across 
the analyses and included demographics, baseline clinical and disease status. 
The main results of these analyses are summarised in Table 11 and the final population PK parameter 
estimates in Table 12. The diagnostics plots and visual predictive checks were considered appropriate 
by the CHMP. 
In all the analyses bodyweight was identified as a statistically significant covariate of interest using 
allometric methods. The magnitude of effect on exposure in both moderate and severe eosinophilic 
asthma subjects and other populations was comparable, but was not considered of clinical importance 
(ranging from a 52% increase to a decrease of 47% for a bodyweight range of 40–162 kg and 
allometric scaling power of 0.75 for clearance: AUC ratio = (40/70)-0.75 = 1.52. 
Albumin and creatinine clearance were identified as additional plausible physiological covariates for 
severe eosinophilic asthma subjects (from study MEA115588), however, like bodyweight, neither were 
deemed clinically significant and thus dose adjustment was not deemed necessary.

Final mepolizumab population PK parameter estimates  
Absorption  
In healthy volunteers, absolute bioavailability results were the following: maximum observed 
concentration (Cmax) for SC and IM were approximately 30% and 40% of IV, respectively; area under 
the concentration-time curves extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞), and hence absolute bioavailability, was 
64–75% (SC) and 81% (IM) of those for IV infusion. 
In patients with moderate/severe asthma, bioavailability was 74% (SC) compared with the IV 
treatment arm in Study MEA114092 model. In Study MEA115588, additional samples at approximate 
Cmax were described using the same model. Absorption rate and bioavailability were comparable 
(0.29/day and 80%), whilst in Study MEA115575 absorption rate was 0.12/day, although only trough 
samples were collected. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 28/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption of mepolizumab SC in subjects with moderate/severe asthma was described in Study 
MEA114092 using a two compartment population PK model with first-order absorption without time-
lag, distribution and elimination. After fixing distribution parameters to IV values, the absorption rate 
was 0.19/day; implying absorption is complete after 18 days (five absorption half-lives). The estimated 
Tmax in subjects with moderate/severe asthma was 6–8 days. 
Distribution 
Following IV infusion, mepolizumab distributed into central plasma volume and declined in a bi-
exponential manner reflecting distribution into interstitial space and subsequent elimination. Analysis 
of Phase IIb/III study MEA112997 using a previous meta-analysis of early IV data estimated the 
central volume to be 3.2 L (46 ml/kg) (Table 11), without further model refinement. In the PopPK 
model meta-analysis the distribution half-life was 1–2 days, implying that following SC injection, 
absorption and distribution occur during the same time frame and that antibody tissue distribution is 
complete after approximately 5–10 days.  
Metabolism 
Mepolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is catabolized by ubiquitous proteolytic 
enzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue. Since the target for mepolizumab is a soluble cytokine (not a 
membrane-bound receptor), mepolizumab does not undergo target-mediated degradation. 
Elimination 
In healthy volunteers, the mean terminal-phase elimination half-life was 18–20 days for all 
administration routes.  
The mean systemic clearance of mepolizumab in patients with moderate to severe eosinophilic asthma 
ranged from 0.21–0.23 L/day (3.0–3.3 ml/day/kg). The model-derived terminal-phase elimination 
half-life was 18–28 days independent of the route. The terminal-phase elimination half-life was 
consistent across studies and independent of dose, administration site, and route. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
• 
Dose proportionality 
Across all studies and all doses, mepolizumab systemic clearance was slow, linear and independent of 
dose, indicating linear pharmacokinetics over the entire dose range tested (12.5–750 mg). 
• 
Time dependency 
Mepolizumab showed time-independent pharmacokinetics, based on simulation of the third dose mean 
concentrations using superposition of a one-compartment PK model of the first dose data. 
• 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Intra-individual variability assessed as residual variability was low 24 -29% and inter-individual 
variability following adjustment for body weight was 29- 33%.

Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
Mepolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody characterized by a large molecular weight of 
149.2 kDa that precludes its elimination by glomerular filtration. Consequently, changes in renal 
function were not anticipated to impact the elimination of mepolizumab and a renal impairment study 
was not, therefore, conducted.  
From the PopPK analysis of Phase III severe asthma data there was no evidence of reduced 
mepolizumab clearance in patients with creatinine clearance values between 50–80 ml/min compared 
with patients with creatinine clearance values >80 ml/min. However, the data in patients with 
creatinine clearance values ≤ 50 ml/min are currently limited.  
No dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is recommended. This was endorsed by the 
CHMP and was appropriately reflected in the SmPC (section 4.2). 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
A hepatic impairment study was not conducted because mepolizumab is catabolized by ubiquitous 
proteolytic enzymes that are not restricted to hepatic tissue. Consequently, hepatic function is not 
expected to impact the elimination of mepolizumab. 
From the PopPK analysis of Phase IIb/III severe asthma data there was no evidence of any influence 
on clearance of markers of liver inflammation such as bilirubin (0–40 µmol/L), alkaline phosphatase 
(25–358 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (4–228 IU/L), and aspartate aminotransferase (9–129 IU/L). 
Across the different studies and indications, the range for these variables were 0–60 µmol/L, 25–358 
IU/L, 4–228 IU/L, and 9–175 IU/L for bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and 
aspartate aminotransferase, respectively. The majority of values were within the normal range. 
No dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment was recommended. This was endorsed by the 
CHMP and was appropriately reflected in the SmPC (section 4.2). 
• 
Gender 
Mepolizumab showed no apparent differences with gender.  
• 
Race 
A specific single ascending mepolizumab IV dose (10, 75, 250 and 750 mg) study was conducted in 
healthy male Japanese subjects (Study MEA115705). The results showed no apparent ethnic 
differences in mepolizumab pharmacokinetics when compared with historic data in Caucasian subjects.  
A population PK analysis of the pivotal Phase III study MEA115588 conducted in severe eosinophilic 
asthma patients (including Japanese adult and adolescent subjects) did not identify race, ethnicity or 
country as covariates of exposure. Mepolizumab concentrations, clearance and apparent clearance 
(CL/F) in Japanese subjects were consistent with non-Japanese subjects. 
• 
Weight 
Although bodyweight was found to be a statistically significant covariate for clearance and volume in 
the population PK analysis for mepolizumab, the magnitude of effect was not considered to be clinically 
relevant and no dosage adjustment for body weight was recommended in the SmPC. The CHMP 
considered this acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 30/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Elderly 
Although specific studies were not conducted in the elderly, mepolizumab has been administered to 
subjects aged up to 82 years (including 90 subjects ≥ 65 years). Age was not identified as a covariate 
neither in the population PK meta-analysis of mepolizumab IV (which explored the age range between 
18-74 years) nor in the three Phase IIb/III population PK analyses of mepolizumab IV and SC in 
severe eosinophilic asthma patients (which explored the age range between 12–82 years). 
No dose adjustment was required for elderly patients. This was endorsed by the CHMP and is reflected 
in the SmPC (section 4.2). 
• 
Children 
Mepolizumab IV pharmacokinetics were evaluated in a paediatric study previous submitted and 
assessed as part of the evaluation of Bosatria, which involved subjects aged 2–17 years with 
eosinophilic oesophagitis. Three doses of 0.55, 2.5 and 10 mg/kg were studied in ~20 subjects each 
and sparse samples were taken for PK. After adjusting for bodyweight via weight-based dosing, it was 
concluded that age was not a determinant of exposure. A population PK analysis of the data using the 
previous adult meta-analysis model was performed and the exponent for weight on clearance was fixed 
at 0.75, not 1.  
In the pivotal Phase IIb/III severe eosinophilic asthma studies, mepolizumab SC and IV 
pharmacokinetics were evaluated in nineteen adolescents aged 12–17 years. Population PK analysis of 
the Phase IIb/III data did not identify age as a covariate of exposure, and concentrations in 
adolescents were consistent with adults. Predicted clearance in adolescent subjects was within the rest 
of the study population range, irrespective of administration route.  
However, the CHMP considered that the current available PK data in children were too limited to allow 
a robust model to be developed and no dose recommendation could be made. This was accordingly 
reflected in the SmPC (section 4.2): The safety and efficacy of Nucala in children and adolescents 
under 18 years of age has not yet been established. Very limited data are currently available in 
children 12 to 18 years old (therefore no recommendations can be made. 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
• 
In vitro 
No in-vitro PK interaction studies were submitted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP based 
on the nature of mepolizumab. 
• 
In vivo 
The subcutaneous administration route is unaffected by food and therefore no food-effect studies were 
conducted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The potential for drug-drug interactions with mepolizumab was classified as low in consideration of 
mepolizumab’s target, elimination mechanism, favourable safety profile at doses up to 750 mg IV and 
the lack of mechanism of action rationale for a potential interaction. No drug interaction studies have 
therefore been conducted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The target for mepolizumab is the cytokine IL-5, a soluble target, which promotes growth, 
differentiation and survival of eosinophils. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6), 
via interaction with their cognate receptors on hepatocytes, have been shown to suppress the 
formation of CYP450 enzymes and drug transporters. However, in the literature review conducted by 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 31/101 
 
 
 
 
 
the applicant, elevation of systemic pro-inflammatory markers was found to be minimal in severe 
asthma and no evidence of IL-5 receptor alpha expression on hepatocytes was found. This has been 
adequately reflected in the SmPC (section 4.5). 
Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody with a large molecular weight (149.2 kDa) precluding renal 
elimination, which is catabolized by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes not restricted to hepatic tissue. 
Mepolizumab does not undergo target-mediated clearance and changes in target concentration do not 
influence exposure. The clearance mechanism is non-specific, with large capacity and no overlapping 
clearance mechanism with small molecule drugs. 
In the population pharmacokinetics analyses of the Phase III studies, there was no evidence of an 
effect of commonly co-administered small molecule drugs on mepolizumab exposure. Likewise, there 
was no evidence of dose adjustments being required for the small molecule drugs commonly co-
administered in the intended target population (e.g., inhaled and oral corticosteroids). These data 
supported the absence of a disease or mepolizumab –related effect on the CYP450 or drug transporter 
expression. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Mepolizumab binds with high specificity and affinity to human interleukin 5 (IL-5), the key cytokine 
responsible for regulation of blood and tissue eosinophils. IL-5 is the most potent and specific cytokine 
for the eosinophil lineage and is responsible for cellular expansion, release from the bone marrow into 
the peripheral blood, and survival following a variety of triggers, typically TH2 stimuli. 
By targeting IL-5, mepolizumab prevents IL-5 from binding to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor 
complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibits IL-5 signalling and the over-
expression of peripheral blood and tissue eosinophils. Neutralizing IL-5 reduces the promotion, growth 
and survival of eosinophils in blood, sputum and other tissues, although complete blood eosinopenia is 
not possible due to redundant signalling by IL-3 and GM-CSF through a common β-sub-unit [Asquith, 
2008]. 
The rationale for targeting IL-5 with mepolizumab was based upon the role of the eosinophil as an 
important inflammatory cell in the pathogenesis of asthma. Asthma is a complex disorder characterised 
by intermittent, reversible airway obstruction and airway hyper-responsiveness. In response to 
allergen, some allergic asthmatics exhibit a biphasic bronchoconstrictor response with an early and late 
phase reaction. The early response is initiated by bronchospastic mediator release and the late phase 
response by recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells with concomitant mediator/cytokine 
release. It is this latter inflammatory response, mediated through recruitment of eosinophils to the 
lung, that is believed to be the major cause of the smooth muscle hypertrophy and chronic mucosal 
damage that leads to airway hyper-reactivity and deterioration in lung function over time. There is 
evidence that eosinophils are important in cough, airway remodelling and asthma exacerbations. 
Specifically, the role of eosinophils in exacerbations may be particularly important because an asthma 
management strategy directed at normalising the sputum eosinophil count reduced the number of 
severe exacerbations compared to standard management. 
Primary pharmacology 
The effects of mepolizumab on eosinophils were studied in blood and sputum of patients with asthma. 
Serum free and total IL-5 were also measured to supplement the pharmacology of mepolizumab.

•  Blood eosinophils 
In single dose studies in healthy volunteers, mepolizumab IV produced reductions from baseline of at 
least 50%; their magnitude and duration was dose-dependent. 
In repeat dose studies in mild to severe eosinophilic asthma, mepolizumab produced a sustained dose-
dependent reduction in blood eosinophils from 57-88% with a dose-dependent time to repletion after 
treatment. Disease severity did not appear to be determinant of eosinophil response (figure 6). 
Figure 6: 
Blood eosinophils ratio to BL (95% CI) - Study MEA112997 (severe asthma) 
Administration route did not change the eosinophil response. After adjusting for absolute bioavailability 
the two asthma studies, MEA114092 and MEA115588, showed comparable blood eosinophil reductions 
of 80-86% for SC and IV doses. 
Likewise, concomitant steroid reduction did not influence the effects of mepolizumab on blood 
eosinophil reduction. Mepolizumab SC 100 mg produced reductions in blood eosinophil count of 84% 
with and without reductions in steroids (studies MEA115575 and MEA115588). 
The consistent incomplete maximum blood eosinophil reductions of 80–90% are postulated to be due 
to redundancy in IL-5 signalling with GM-CSF and Interleukin-3 (IL-3) through a common β-sub-unit. 
•  Sputum eosinophils 
In the moderate/severe and severe eosinophilic asthma studies, mepolizumab IV and SC both 
produced dose-dependent reductions in sputum eosinophils. In the Phase IIb/III study MEA112997, 
mepolizumab IV 75–750 mg produced reductions of 32–88% at Week 52 (Figure 7).

• 
Interleukin 5 
Serum free IL-5 was undetectable at baseline in most subjects, whether healthy or asthmatic. Single 
IV doses of mepolizumab produced a dose-dependent increase in serum total IL-5. 
In Study MEA114092, total IL-5 increased with no evidence of dose-response over the range 12.5 - 
250 mg (3 SC doses at Day 1, 28, 56). At later time points post-treatment, a faster decline in total IL-
5 was observed at the lower dose. There was no relationship between serum total IL-5 and blood 
eosinophils based on exploratory plots and correlation analyses. 
In subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma (Study MEA112997), free IL-5 remained undetectable at 
all doses; however, total IL-5 increased to saturation, with no evidence of dose-response over the 
ranges 75–750 mg IV (Figure 8).

Secondary pharmacology 
Mepolizumab being a large molecule is unlikely to directly inhibit hERG channel. Furthermore, it has a 
highly specific target and does not bind to cardiac tissue. In an immunohistochemistry tissue cross-
reactivity study, mepolizumab binding was restricted to human lymphoid tissues. Therefore, it has a 
low risk for QT-mediated proarrhythmia and a thorough QTc study was not conducted. However, 
thorough ECG monitoring was conducted in Phase III studies (see 2.6 safety section). 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Several PK/PD analyses were conducted to estimate mepolizumab exposure-response. Analysis of a 
previously submitted and assessed (as part of the evaluation of Bosatria) single ascending dose study 
in subjects with mild asthma showed that the PK/PD of mepolizumab was well-described by an indirect 
response model with 85% maximum reduction in eosinophil synthesis and a plasma concentration for 
half-maximal achievable effect (IC50) of 0.45 mcg/ml. The PK/PD relationship was refined using 
analyses of studies MEA112997 and MEA114092. The estimated maximal effects (94% and 93%) and 
IC50’s (0.23 and 1.3 mcg/ml) were both broadly consistent with the earlier values. 
Study MEA114092 was conducted with the objective to show that the exposure-response relationship 
(AUCeos(0–Day 84) versus cumulative plasma mepolizumab AUC(0–Day 84) did not differ between the 
SC and IV administration.  
This study “A multicentre, open-label, dose ranging study to determine the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab administered intravenously or subcutaneously to adult asthmatic 
subjects with elevated blood eosinophil levels” 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that the PK/PD relationship between the exposure of 
subcutaneously (SC) administered mepolizumab and a marker of response, blood eosinophil, (AUCeos 
(0–Day 84) did not differ from that observed following intravenous (IV) administration. Other 
objectives included an assessment of the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of repeat doses of 
mepolizumab when administered SC and IV to asthmatic adult subjects with elevated blood eosinophil 
levels.  
This was a multi-centre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, repeat dose, dose-ranging study in 
adult subjects with moderate/severe asthma and blood eosinophil levels >300 cells/μL. Subjects were 
randomised 4:3:4:2 to mepolizumab SC 12.5, 125, 250 mg, and mepolizumab IV 75 mg.  
They received three doses of mepolizumab every 28 days. The IV infusion was given over 30–60 
minutes and the SC injection was given in the upper arm. Subjects were followed to Day 140. Blood 
samples were collected for pharmacokinetics (sparse sampling), eosinophil count and serum free and 
total IL-5, along with induced sputum for eosinophil count. 
Seventy subjects were enrolled into the study. A dose-response to blood eosinophil count was 
observed, with the mepolizumab SC 12.5 mg showing notably higher eosinophil count compared with 
other doses.  
A non-linear inhibitory dose-response model was used to describe Day 84 data. The maximum 
inhibitory effect (Imax) was 89% and the SC doses associated with half-maximal (ID 50) and 90% 
maximal (ID 90) response achievable by the drug were 11 mg and 99 mg, respectively, corresponding 
to an IV dose of 75 mg. The estimated SC absolute bioavailability was 74% and the terminal-phase 
elimination half-life was 22 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 35/101 
 
 
 
 
 
Independent data from the Phase IIb/III dose-ranging study MEA112997 were used to validate the 
dose-response by superimposing mepolizumab IV 75, 250 and 750 mg blood eosinophil count data 
over the model predictions and adjusting for absolute bioavailability.  
Sputum eosinophil count also decreased in a dose-dependent manner, with larger decreases observed 
in the mepolizumab SC 125 mg and 250 mg treatment groups compared with 12.5 mg. Serum total IL-
5 levels (i.e., free IL-5 plus complex) increased from baseline at all doses. 
Sparse pharmacokinetic samples were collected and analysed using population PK methods. Tmax was 
reached 6–8 days post-dosing in the SC dose groups and apparent clearance and volume, CL/F and 
V/F, were dose-independent implying linear-time-independent pharmacokinetics, with 1.7-fold 
accumulation for area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC(0-tau)) and 
Cmax. 
The relationship between blood eosinophil count and mepolizumab plasma concentration was described 
using a population PK/PD analysis. The estimated maximum inhibition was 93% and the IC50 was 1.26 
mcg/ml.  
Administration route did not affect the mepolizumab exposure-response relationship for blood 
eosinophil count. Over the range 12.5–250 mg, mepolizumab SC pharmacokinetics were approximately 
dose proportional, linear and time-independent with accumulation predicted from the elimination half-
life. 
Overall, because of the limited range of data from the IV cohort it was not possible to test if the two 
half maximal effective concentration (EC50) were different. Visual inspection showed however, that 
there was no obvious difference between the 75 mg IV and 125 mg SC arms.

An updated POPPKPD model based on blood eosinophil count was requested by the CHMP during the 
procedure which appeared consistent with previous analysis with a plasma concentration for half 
maximal effect of 0.9 µg/ml and a maximal effect of 83%. 
A meta-analysis of annualised exacerbation rate dose-response using individualized weight-based 
doses from Phase IIb/III and Phase III studies MEA112997 and MEA115588 failed to estimate any 
parametric dose-response accurately.  
A Bayesian analysis with informative log-normal for the half-maximal inhibitory efficacious dose 
confirmed that the ID 50 for efficacy is consistent with the pharmacological value of 11 mg SC (or 0.16 
mg/kg), nine-fold lower than the mepolizumab SC 100 mg clinical dose. Data from the combined Phase 
IIb/III studies shifted the prior from an initial mean of 20 mg SC to the pharmacological value, with a 
reduction in the width of the credibility interval, whilst retaining an approximate log-normal 
distribution. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Mepolizumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, the pharmacokinetics of which are consistent with other 
monoclonal antibodies targeting soluble ligands. The pharmacokinetics are linear, dose-proportional 
and time-independent after both IV and SC administration.  
Comparison of results of the four studies in moderate/severe eosinophilic asthma with earlier studies 
indicated that mepolizumab pharmacokinetics are unchanged in the population of interest of this 
application, severe eosinophilic asthma. 
Mepolizumab subcutaneous absorption is slow, with an absolute bioavailability of 74– 80% following 
injection in the arm, a Tmax of 4–8 days and an absorption and distribution half-lives of 1–2 days. 
Mepolizumab distributes into a volume that approximates plasma and interstitial space (55–85 ml/kg) 
and is catabolized by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes. 
Mepolizumab does not undergo target-mediated clearance. Mepolizumab is eliminated with a systemic 
clearance of 0.22 L/day (for 70 kg subject; or 3.1 ml/day/kg) and has a terminal-phase elimination 
half-life of 16–22 days, with two-fold accumulation following repeat dosing every four weeks, 
consistent with the long half-life. The pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab is consistent across studies, 
diseases and in Caucasian and Japanese subjects. Age does not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
mepolizumab however within this application there were no data in those over 82 years. As described 
in the relevant subsection of section 2.4.2, there are limited data in children; however, a population PK 
analysis studying the effect of weight on PK suggested that the exponent for weight on clearance is 
0.75. Therefore weight-based dosing would result in slightly lower exposures in children than in adults. 
However the magnitude of effect was not considered to be clinically relevant and no dosage 
adjustment for body weight was recommended in the SmPC. The CHMP considered this acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 37/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mepolizumab has low immunogenicity (≤ 6%), which does not influence either pharmacokinetics or 
pharmacodynamics discernibly in ADA-positive subjects.  
The CHMP considered that no dosage adjustment for mepolizumab was necessary based on the 
population pharmacokinetic analyses submitted within application. This was reflected in the SmPC 
(section 4.2). 
Pharmacodynamics 
The CHMP considered that the mechanism of action of mepolizumab was well established. Mepolizumab 
prevents IL-5 binding to the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibits IL-5 signalling and its downstream 
effects, i.e. the promotion, growth and survival of eosinophils in blood, sputum and other tissues, 
although complete blood eosinopenia is not possible due to compensatory signalling by IL-3 and GM-
CSF.  
The ligand interaction has been explored in vitro in the pre-clinical development and in vivo in human 
pharmacology studies of blood and sputum levels in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. 
Mepolizumab was shown to have a potent and prolonged effect in reducing blood and sputum 
eosinophil levels over a wide range of doses. At the proposed recommended dose, a reduction of about 
80% in blood eosinophils was consistently observed and this effect was slowly reversible, as blood 
eosinophil count remained reduced by about 60% eight weeks after discontinuation of treatment. A 
reduction in sputum eosinophils was also observed although more modest at this dose (about 30%).  
No relationship was evident between serum IL-5 and blood eosinophils and no direct relationship 
between blood eosinophil levels and clinical effects, especially on the frequency of asthma 
exacerbations, were observed. 
Serum IL-5 was not detectable in asthmatic patients and total IL-5 concentrations were observed to 
increase during treatment with mepolizumab as a result of the formation of mepolizumab-IL-5 
complexes, which decreased IL-5 clearance. However, as there was no increase in free bioactive IL-5, 
no clinical consequence was expected. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The applicant did no conduct conventional special clinical pharmacology studies due to the nature of 
the molecule, its mechanism of action and elimination pathways. No in vitro interaction studies were 
conducted by the applicant because the potential for drug-drug interaction (DDI) was deemed low. The 
applicant conducted a review of the scientific literature and did not find reports of IL-5 receptor alpha 
(IL-5Rα) expression on hepatocytes. In experiments with other interleukins that have minimal surface 
receptor expression, a low level of CYP3A4 suppression was generated. Together with negligible cell 
surface receptor expression and minimal stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine release, it was 
argued that cytokines with such characteristics (like IL-5) may pose less DDI risk with small-molecule 
drugs. Furthermore, clinical evidence shows that elevation of systemic pro-inflammatory markers is 
minimal in severe asthma compared to other inflammatory diseases. This was endorsed by the CHMP 
and appropriately reflected SmPC (section 4.5). 
The applicant investigated potential associations between genetic polymorphisms, gender, race or 
ethnicity and mepolizumab treatment response (exacerbation rate and blood eosinophil count) in the 
two main studies. No apparent influence of genetic factors on the PD response to mepolizumab was 
observed. 
The secondary pharmacology of mepolizumab was not explored in the clinical development of 
mepolizumab as the applicant claimed that there are no secondary pharmacology actions. However, in 
mice, IL-5 stimulates B-lymphocyte function and production of immunoglobulins, and eosinophils have 
a role  in defence against some endoparasites. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 38/101 
 
 
 
 
 
Finally, as mepolizumab is unlikely to produce QTc prolongation, no specific study was performed but 
ECG monitoring and thorough evaluation of the data were conducted in the Phase III trials (see 2.6 
safety section). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Extensive PK and PD data were submitted. The PK profile of mepolizumab was well characterised and 
was adequately described in section 5.2 of the SmPC.  
There was no need for dose adjustment in the elderly and patients with liver or renal impairment. 
However, data are currently limited in the paediatric population and do not allow a robust PK model to 
be developed. All this was endorsed by the CHMP and adequately reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Three main studies are considered the primary efficacy studies for mepolizumab in severe eosinophilic 
asthma: one Phase IIb/IIIa exacerbation dose-ranging study (MEA112997) and two Phase IIIa studies 
an exacerbation study (MEA115588) and an OCS reduction study (MEA115575). Table 9 summarises 
these three main studies.  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The dose-ranging study (MEA112997) was actually one of the three pivotal placebo-controlled trials in 
severe refractory asthma and is described in detail in section 2.5.2.  
The aim was to investigate the dose-response relationship on PD and efficacy outcomes and it studied 
three intravenous doses (75 mg, 250 mg and 750 mg) of mepolizumab administered monthly. 
However no relationship between mepolizumab dose (75–750 mg IV) and clinical response (annualised 
exacerbation rate) in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma was observed. There was however 
evidence of increasing blood eosinophil reduction (78–88%) with increasing dose, albeit from already 
high inhibition.  
The lowest dose was selected for further development based on PKPD modelling (see sections 2.4.2 
and 2.4.3) .Based on the pharmacological correspondence showed in study MEA114092, mepolizumab 
SC 100 mg was selected for Phase III studies to provide the same pharmacological response as 
mepolizumab IV 75 mg (i.e., the ID90 for maximum achievable pharmacological effect).  
2.5.2.  Main studies

controlled, parallel group, dose ranging study to determine the effect of mepolizumab on

Study Participants  
The inclusion criteria were the following: male or female non-smoking subjects aged ≥ 12 years and 
weighing ≥ 45 kg with severe refractory asthma [ATS workshop, 2000], with a requirement for regular 
treatment with high dose ICS (i.e., ≥880 µg/day fluticasone propionate or equivalent daily), plus

additional controller medication (e.g., long-acting beta-2 receptor agonist, leukotriene receptor 
antagonist or theophylline) and with or without maintenance OCS in the 12 previous months.  
Subjects were also required to have persistent airflow obstruction as indicated by a pre-bronchodilator 
Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) <80% predicted; a history of ≥ 2 asthma exacerbations 
requiring treatment with oral or systemic CS in the 12 previous months and evidence of asthma 
documented by one of the following measures: (a) airway reversibility (FEV1≥12% and 200 mL), (b) 
airway hyper-responsiveness (methacholine, histamine mannitol test), (c) airflow variability indicated 
by in clinic FEV1 ≥20% between two visits or >20% diurnal variability in Peak Exploratory Flow (PEF) 
observed on 3 or more days. 
Finally subjects were also required to have airway inflammation likely to be eosinophilic in nature as 
indicated by one of the following characteristics demonstrated at the entry visit or documented in the 
previous 12 months: (a) peripheral blood eosinophil level ≥ 300/µL, (b) sputum eosinophils ≥3%, (c) 
exhaled nitric oxide ≥ 50 ppb or (d) prompt deterioration of asthma control (based on documented 
clinical history or objective measures) following a ≤ 25% reduction in regular maintenance dose of ICS 
or OCS in the previous 12 months. 
The main exclusion criteria were: current smokers or smoking history of ≥10 pack/year, other lung 
condition, malignancy, unstable liver disease, Churg-Strauss syndrome, history of immunosuppressant 
therapies, omalizumab, or other anti-inflammatory biological treatment within a defined period before 
screening, regular systemic use of corticosteroids for diseases other than asthma, intramuscular 
corticosteroids within 1 month and long-acting depot corticosteroids within 3 months. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to receive mepolizumab at doses of 75 mg, 250 mg or 750 mg or placebo 
IV once every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. The solution was administered as an infusion over approximately 
30 minutes given by a designated, blinded member of the site staff. 
Prior and concomitant medications 
Additional asthma medications such as theophyllines or anti-leukotrienes were permitted provided they 
had been taken regularly in the 12 months prior to randomisation. Maintenance OCS were also 
permitted provided at least one of the exacerbations in the previous 12 months had occurred while the 
subject was receiving OCS and had been treated with a two-fold or greater increase in the dose of OCS 
for at least 3 days. 
Prohibited medications included: investigational drugs, intra-articular corticosteroids, methotrexate, 
troleandomycin, oral gold, cyclosporine, azathioprine, omalizumab or other biologicals for the 
treatment of inflammatory conditions, chemotherapy/radiotherapy and regular oral or systemic 
corticosteroids for the treatment of conditions other than asthma. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To evaluate the dose response, based on efficacy and safety of three doses of mepolizumab (75 mg, 
250 mg and 750 mg) over a 52 week treatment period in adult and adolescent subjects with severe 
uncontrolled refractory asthma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 40/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary objective 
To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of mepolizumab on the number of eosinophils in blood, serum 
IL-5 and number of eosinophils in induced sputum. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Frequency of clinically significant exacerbations of asthma as defined by worsening of asthma which in 
the investigator’s opinion required use of oral/systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days and/or 
hospitalisation and/or emergency department (ED) visits. For subjects on maintenance OCS, an 
exacerbation requiring OCS was defined as the use of oral/systemic corticosteroids at least double the 
existing maintenance dose for at least 3 days. 
In order to provide an objective assessment of the circumstances linked to the clinical decision that 
defined asthma exacerbations, the Investigator was to take into account changes from baseline on one 
or more of the following parameters recorded in the subject’s e-diary: (a) a decrease in morning peak 
flow, (b) an increase in the use of rescue medication, (c) increases in the frequency of nocturnal 
awakening due to asthma symptoms requiring rescue medication use and (d) an increase in overall 
asthma symptom score. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
• 
• 
• 
Time to first clinically significant exacerbation requiring oral or systemic corticosteroids, 
hospitalisation, and/or ED visits 
Frequency of exacerbations and time to first exacerbation requiring hospitalisation (including 
intubation and admittance to an intensive care unit) or ED visits 
Frequency and time to  Investigator-defined exacerbations 
•  Mean change from baseline in clinic pre and post -bronchodilator FEV1 over the 52 week 
treatment period 
•  Mean change from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score 
Definitions of exacerbations  
Clinically significant exacerbations, as previously defined, were recorded in the eCRF by the 
Investigator and verified using data from the patient eDiary. If an event described as an exacerbation 
had not been associated with deterioration in eDiary parameters, the Investigator was to provide an 
explanation to support the decision for defining the event as an exacerbation. 
All exacerbations: These are the exacerbations that at a minimum met the requirement for worsening 
of asthma symptoms that required either treatment with systemic costicosteroids for at least 3 days 
and/or hospitalisation and/or ED visits. This term comprises both ‘clinically significant exacerbations’ 
and ‘investigator-defined exacerbations’. 
Investigator-defined exacerbation: These exacerbations are the subset of ‘all exacerbations’ that did 
not have objective data from either the eDiary or the Investigator to support the exacerbation. 
Sample size 
A total of 128 subjects per arm completing the study was estimated to give 90% power to detect a 
decrease in the exacerbation rate with increasing dose of mepolizumab 4-weekly, from 1.5 p.a. on 
placebo to 0.9 p.a. on mepolizumab 750 mg 4-weekly (a 40% decrease) at a two-sided 5%

significance level. Based on an assumed withdrawal rate of 15%, the planned number of randomised 
subjects was increased to 151 subjects per arm. The calculation assumed that the number of 
exacerbations per year would follow a negative binomial distribution with a dispersion parameter 
k=0.7. 
Randomisation 
After a screening visit (Visit 1), the study included a run-in period of 2 weeks during which 
maintenance asthma therapy had to be unchanged. At visit 2, patients underwent pulmonary 
functional testing and were randomised. 
The randomisation schedule was generated based on randomly permuted blocks with a block size of 
eight using the validated randomisation software RandAll. Subjects were randomised centrally with 
equal numbers of subjects allocated to each treatment. The study was randomised separately for each 
country and subjects were stratified according to regular use, or not, of maintenance OCS. 
Blinding (masking) 
Mepolizumab and placebo were identical in appearance and were administered by a designated blinded 
member of the site staff. An unblinded pharmacist/designated site staff prepared the appropriate 
strength according to the medication assigned to the subject from a telephone interactive voice 
response system (IVRS). The study was blinded to those involved in the evaluation of the study (i.e. 
physician/nurse and subject) and this was maintained at all times. 
Statistical methods 
The primary comparison was the linear test for trend of a decrease in exacerbation rate with increasing 
dose of mepolizumab, with placebo being assigned as a dose of zero. Each of the three doses of 
mepolizumab had then to be compared to placebo. Multiplicity across these comparisons was 
controlled using a closed testing procedure followed by a one-sided Hochberg testing procedure. 
Results 
Participant flow  
Overall, 888 subjects were screened, 272 subjects were excluded (including 5 patients randomised in 
error). The ITT Population consisted of all subjects randomised to treatment who received at least one 
dose of trial medication. This was the primary population for the analysis of all efficacy and safety 
endpoints. A diagram of the participant flow is presented in Figure 9.

Study MEA115588 (MENSA): A randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre study of the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab 
adjunctive therapy in subjects with severe uncontrolled refractory asthma 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The selection criteria were the same as in Study MEA112997 except for: 
• 
• 
subjects aged 12-17 years for whom high ICS doses was defined as ≥440 µg/day Fluticasone 
Propionate (FP) (ex-actuator) or equivalent daily and pre-bronchodilator FEV1 <90% predicted; 
and  
the eosinophilic phenotype definition which for this study was defined as an elevated peripheral 
blood eosinophil count of ≥300/µL that is related to asthma demonstrated in the past 12 months 
prior to Visit 1 or an elevated peripheral blood eosinophil count of ≥150/µL at Visit 1. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to receive mepolizumab at doses of 75 mg IV, 100 mg SC or placebo IV/SC 
once every 4 weeks for 28 weeks, (i.e. 8 doses). Due to the double dummy design, the subject had to 
receive 2 injections, one IV and one SC into separate arms. Prior and concomitant medications were 
the same as in Study MEA112997. The study schematic is shown in figure 10. 
Figure 10: 
Study MEA115588 study design scheme 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of mepolizumab 75 mg IV or 100 mg 
SC every 4 weeks versus placebo on the frequency of clinically significant exacerbations in adult and 
adolescent subjects with severe, uncontrolled, refractory asthma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 45/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary objectives 
Secondary objectives were to compare the safety and tolerability of mepolizumab with placebo in 
subjects with severe refractory asthma, and to evaluate the effects of mepolizumab compared with 
placebo on a range of clinical markers of asthma control, including pulmonary function (FEV1) and St. 
George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
These were the same as for Study MEA112997 except for the use of the SGRQ instead of the AQLQ. 
Sample size 
The study, with 180 subjects randomised to each treatment arm, was designed to have over 90% 
power to detect a 40% decrease in exacerbation rate from 2.4 per annum (p.a.) on placebo to 1.44 
p.a. on each of the mepolizumab treatment arms using a two-sided 5% significance level. The 
calculation assumed that the number of exacerbations per year followed a negative binomial 
distribution with a dispersion parameter k=0.8. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomisation schedule which was 
generated using a validated randomisation software RandAll. Subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1 
ratio. 
Blinding (masking) 
See Study MEA112997  
Statistical methods 
This study was designed to test the superiority of mepolizumab 75 mg IV vs. placebo and the 
superiority of mepolizumab 100 mg SC vs. placebo. Multiplicity across treatment comparisons and 
primary and secondary endpoints was controlled using a closed testing procedure: a one-sided 
Hochberg testing procedure was used for multiple treatment comparisons (75mg IV vs. placebo; 
100mg SC vs. placebo) and a hierarchical ‘gatekeeping’ approach to control multiplicity across 
endpoints. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Overall, 802 subjects were screened, 222 subjects were excluded, 580 were randomised but 576 
received at least one dose of study drug (ITT Population); two subjects were randomised in error and 2 
subjects were withdrawn due to issues in obtaining an IV line. A diagram of the participant flow is 
presented in Figure 11.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted in 119 centres in 16 countries. The highest recruitment was in the EU and 
US. 
Conduct of the study 
No protocol amendment was implemented during the study.  
Baseline characteristics 
The study population was primarily white (78%) and more than half were female (57%); the mean age 
was 50 years. Twenty-five adolescent subjects (9 in each of the placebo and mepolizumab 75 mg IV 
groups and 7 in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group) and 80 elderly subjects (26 in the placebo group, 
24 in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group and 30 in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group) participated in 
the study. 
Asthma history was similar between the treatment groups. The median duration of asthma was 17 
years. The majority of subjects (76%) had asthma for ≥10 years; 31% of subjects had asthma for ≥25 
years. The majority of subjects (69%) had ≥300 eosinophils/µL within 12 months prior to the 
Screening visit, and 83% of subjects had ≥150 eosinophils/µL at the Screening visit. Twenty-one 
subjects (4%) had been intubated due to asthma prior to the study. All subjects were treated with 
high-dose ICS for 12 months prior to screening and 24% were taking continuous OCS with a mean 
prednisone-equivalent dose of 13.2 mg/day, with doses ranging from 1 to 80 mg. Few subjects in each 
treatment group had a history of omalizumab use: 21 subjects (11%) in the placebo group, 29 
subjects (15%) in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV and 25 subjects (13%) in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC 
group. 
Overall, 57% of the subjects had >2 exacerbations in the previous 12 months and 19% had at least 
one hospitalisation. 
Lung function tests at screening showed a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of 1.69 L and percent 
predicted FEV1 of 57%. Mean post-bronchodilator lung function tests showed an FEV1 of 2.11 L, 
percent predicted FEV1 of 71%, FEV1/FVC ratio of 66%, and FEV1 reversibility of 28%. 
Numbers analysed 
Overall, 576 subjects were included in the mITT Population and 546 in the PP Population (Table 16).

Study MEA115575 (SIRIUS): A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group, multi-centre study of mepolizumab adjunctive therapy to reduce steroid use in 
subjects with severe refractory asthma 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The selection criteria were the same as in Study MEA115588 except that the requirement for frequent 
exacerbations was replaced by the requirement for regular treatment with maintenance systemic 
corticosteroids (5.0 to 35 mg/day prednisone or equivalent). 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to receive mepolizumab 100 mg SC or placebo every 4 weeks for 20 weeks 
(i.e. 6 doses). All subjects remained on their existing maintenance asthma therapy throughout this 
study, in addition to the study treatment, while reducing OCS (prednisone or prednisolone provided by 
the study site). 
Study phases 
The study consisted of four phases: 1) OCS Optimization; 2) Induction; 3) OCS Reduction; and 4) 
Maintenance phase. Figure 12 displays a schematic overview of the study design. 
•  OCS optimization phase 
This phase was intended to assure that subjects entered the double-blind treatment phase on the 
lowest dose of OCS that would manage their symptoms. Its duration ranged from a minimum of 3 
weeks to a maximum of 8 weeks (or 10 weeks if an exacerbation occurred). 
The lowest effective OCS dose was defined during this phase by the emergence of asthma symptoms 
or the occurrence of an exacerbation. The emergence of asthma symptoms was determined by an 
increase in the ACQ-5 score of at least +0.5 from the Visit 1 score (collected via e-diary). The lowest 
effective OCS dose was identified as the OCS dose that the subject was taking just prior to the dose 
they were on when the symptoms emerged or the exacerbation occurred. Once the optimised dose was 
determined, the subject had to be able to remain on the optimized prednisone/prednisolone dose for 2 
consecutive weeks prior to randomisation. Prednisone/prednisolone adjustments during this phase 
were made based on a predefined titration schedule. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 48/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Induction phase 
After randomisation and their first injection, subjects remained on their optimized dose of OCS, along 
with their baseline asthma medications. This phase (4-week duration) was designed to allow for 
sufficient time for those subjects randomised to the mepolizumab arm to achieve a decrease in the 
eosinophilic inflammation prior to the reduction in OCS. 
•  OCS reduction phase 
Subjects received five additional doses of double-blind study treatment (i.e., a dose every 4 weeks). 
The prednisone/prednisolone dose was titrated following a pre-defined schedule described. Subjects 
were assessed for OCS dose reduction every 4 weeks. Dose steps were greater and of longer duration 
(i.e., 4 weeks) compared with the schedule of the Optimization Phase. The 4-week timeframe allowed 
for carryover effects from the prior dose to be minimized and also minimized the risk for adrenal 
insufficiency complications. Subjects on lower doses of OCS at baseline could be completely weaned 
from OCS, while subjects on relativity higher doses of OCS at baseline (≥25 mg/day) would not be 
weaned completely. 
OCS dose reduction was to occur per the schedule unless the subject met protocol defined criteria 
indicating that it was not acceptable to reduce OCS. 
•  Maintenance phase 
Subjects were maintained during the last 4 weeks of the study (Weeks 20 through 24) without any 
further OCS dose adjustment.

Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the effects of mepolizumab 100mg SC as an 
adjunctive therapy with placebo on reducing the use of maintenance OCS in systemic corticosteroid-
dependent subjects with severe asthma with elevated eosinophils. 
Secondary objectives 
Secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of mepolizumab compared 
with placebo, in subjects with severe asthma with elevated eosinophils including an evaluation of the 
effects of mepolizumab on markers of asthma impairment and risk including, asthma symptoms, 
pulmonary function, exacerbation rate, and quality of life as assessed by the St. George’s Respiratory 
Questionnaire (SGRQ). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Percent reduction of OCS dose during Weeks 20-24 compared with the baseline dose, while 
maintaining asthma control, categorized as follows: 90% to 100%; 75% to <90%; 50% to <75%; 
>0% to <50%; No decrease in OCS, lack of control during Weeks 20-24, or withdrawal from 
treatment. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction of ≥50% in their daily OCS dose, compared with 
baseline dose 
Proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction of OCS dose to ≤5.0 mg 
Proportion of subjects who achieved a total reduction of OCS dose 
•  Median percentage reduction from baseline in daily OCS dose 
Sample size 
This study was designed to detect an increase of 25% in the proportion of subjects achieving ≥50% 
reduction in OCS dose. Based on a placebo proportion of 48%, this implied a mepolizumab proportion 
of 73% and an odds ratio (OR) of 2.9. For a proportional odds model, the sample size estimate was 
dependent on assumptions about the proportion of subjects in each reduction category, not just those 
that achieved a 50% reduction. Using the assumptions for each reduction category based on an OR of 
2.9, a study with 60 subjects per group was estimated to have 90% power to detect an OR of 2.9 of a 
better category on mepolizumab compared with placebo. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomisation schedule which was 
generated using a validated randomisation software RandAll. The study was randomised separately for 
each country and the randomisation was stratified by duration of prior OCS use (<5 years vs. ≥5 
years).

See study MEA 112997 and MEA 115588. 
Statistical methods 
The number of subjects in each category for percent reduction of OCS dose during Weeks 20-24 
compared with the baseline dose was analysed using a proportional odds model (ordered logistic 
regression analysis) with covariates of treatment, region, duration of OCS use at baseline (<5 years 
vs. ≥5 years), and dose of OCS at baseline. All corticosteroids administered via oral, IV and IM routes 
were considered when calculating a subject’s daily prednisone/prednisolone dose regardless of reason 
for administration. The OR was the model estimate of the ratio of the odds (mepolizumab/placebo) of a 
subject's outcome being in a better (greater reduction) category.

The most frequent reasons for failures during the Optimization phase were that subjects did not 
achieve an optimized dose (27) or did not meet the eosinophilic phenotype as defined (10). 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted in 38 centres in 10 countries. The majority of subjects (73%) were recruited 
in the EU. 
Conduct of the study 
An early amendment was implemented, which contained clarifications and minor changes to the 
protocol. 
Baseline data 
The study population was essentially white (95%) with more than half being female (55%); the mean 
age was 50 years. Two adolescents and 14 elderly subjects were enrolled. 
Asthma history was generally similar between the treatment groups. The mean duration of asthma was 
19 years. The majority of subjects (69%) had asthma for ≥10 years; 30% of subjects had asthma for 
≥25 years. Most subjects (90%) had ≥150 eosinophils/µL between visit 1 and visit 3 whereas this 
proportion at visit 3 (baseline) was only 76% (102/135); 68% had a history of blood count ≥300 
eosinophils/µL within the previous 12 months. 
One third of the subjects in each treatment arm (33%) had a history of omalizumab use. The majority 
of subjects in both treatment arms (85% placebo, 83% mepolizumab) had at least one exacerbation in 
the 12 months prior to the screening visit. The mean number of exacerbations experienced during this 
time period was slightly higher in the mepolizumab arm (3.3/year) compared with the placebo arm 
(2.9/year). Likewise, a larger proportion of subjects in the mepolizumab arm required hospitalization 
or an ED visit (33% vs. 17%) or required hospitalization (20% vs. 14%) for exacerbations. 
In contrast, the median daily dose of OCS at baseline (optimized dose) was higher in the placebo arm 
(12.5 mg) than in the mepolizumab arm (10 mg). A larger percentage of subjects in the placebo arm 
were taking OCS doses ≥15 mg/day (41%) compared with the mepolizumab arm (28%); conversely, 
9% vs. 17% of the subjects were taking the lowest dose (5mg/day).

Lung function tests at screening showed a mean pre- and post-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1 
of 56% and 68%, respectively, in the placebo arm vs. 58% and 72%, respectively, in the mepolizumab 
arm. 
Numbers analysed 
Overall, 135 subjects were included in the ITT Population and 122 in the PP Population (Table 17).  
Table 17  Summary of analysis sets 
Outcomes estimation and subgroup analysis 
•  OCS dose reduction 
Subjects treated with mepolizumab were able to achieve a category of greater OCS reduction, while 
maintaining asthma control, compared with subjects treated with placebo; the OR was statistically 
significant in the ITT analysis (2.39; 95% CI: 1.25, 4.56; p=0.008) and in the Per-Protocol analysis 
(2.13; 95%CI: 1.07, 4.22, p=0.03). 
Table 18  Percent OCS reduction from baseline during Week 20-24 (ITT population) 
During Weeks 20-24, more than half of subjects treated with mepolizumab (54%) achieved ≥50% 
reduction from baseline in daily OCS dose compared with 33% of subjects treated with placebo 
(p=0.027). More than half of subjects treated with mepolizumab (54%) also achieved a reduction in 
daily OCS dose to ≤5 mg compared with 32% of subjects treated with placebo (p=0.025). Although 
more subjects treated with mepolizumab achieved a total (100%) reduction in OCS dose (10 subjects, 
14%) compared with those treated with placebo (5 subjects, 8%), the sample size was small and the 
OR was not statistically significant. The median percentage reduction from baseline in daily OCS dose 
was 50% in the mepolizumab group compared with 0% in the placebo group; this difference was 
statistically significant (p=0.007). 
When the primary analysis was analysed by different subgroups based on baseline OCS dose, larger 
effects with mepolizumab were seen for the subgroups with the lowest level of baseline OCS dose (5 to 
<10 mg/day; OR=3.56; 95%CI: 0.97, 13.11) but mostly with the highest level of baseline OCS use 
(≥15 mg/day; OR=6.25; 95%CI: 1.67, 23.38) compared with the middle category (10 to <15 
mg/day; OR=1.07). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1

In the subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint by baseline eosinophils, larger effects with 
mepolizumab were seen for the subgroup of patients with baseline blood eosinophils <150 cells/µL 
compared with those with higher levels (Table 21). In contrast, in the subgroup of patients who met 
the eosinophil inclusion criteria category of ≥300 cells/µL in the prior 12 months, the OR of 4.35 
(95%CI: 1.86, 10.17) was statistically in favour of mepolizumab whereas it was only 1.16 (95%CI: 
0.37, 3.64) in the subgroup of patients who did not meet this criterion.

Exacerbations 
Compared with subjects treated with placebo, fewer subjects treated with mepolizumab experienced 
clinically significant exacerbations (42% vs. 68%), exacerbations requiring hospitalization or an ED 
visit (4% vs. 11%), and exacerbations requiring hospitalization (0% vs. 11%). Subjects treated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 54/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mepolizumab had a 32% reduction in rate of clinically significant exacerbations (1.44/year) compared 
with subjects receiving placebo (2.12/year) (Rate ratio: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.99; p=0.042). 
FEV1 
At baseline, mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was higher in the placebo group (2.01 L) compared with 
the mepolizumab group (1.90 L). Beginning at Week 4 and continuing through Week 24, subjects 
treated with mepolizumab showed greater mean increases from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 
compared with the placebo group at each 4-week assessment; the differences between the treatments 
were statistically significant at Weeks 4, 8, and 16 (p<0.05). 
Mean post-bronchodilator FEV1 was also higher in the placebo group (2.38 L) compared with the 
mepolizumab group (2.24 L) at baseline. At the end of the treatment period (Week 24), the difference 
in the adjusted mean changes from baseline between mepolizumab and placebo groups was 114 mL 
for pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (95% CI: -42 to 271 mL; p=0.151) and 128 mL for post-bronchodilator 
FEV1 (95% CI: -8 to 264 mL; p=0.064). 
Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) 
At baseline, subjects in the mepolizumab arm had a higher mean ACQ-5 score (2.15) than subjects in 
the placebo arm (1.99); both scores were ≥1.5 indicating not well controlled asthma. Beginning at 
Week 2 and continuing through Week 24, subjects treated with mepolizumab showed greater 
decreases (improvement) from baseline in ACQ-5 compared with the placebo arm; the treatment 
differences were statistically significant at most weeks (p≤0.05), except for Weeks 1, 12, and 17. At 
Week 24, subjects treated with mepolizumab had a statistically significant (decrease) improvement 
(mean=-0.61) compared to placebo (mean=-0.09); the difference was statistically significant (-0.52; 
95% CI: -0.87, -0.17; p=0.004) and the improvement was also clinically relevant (>≥ 0.5, minimal 
clinically importantly difference (MCID) for this instrument). The improvement in daily asthma 
symptom score up to 12 weeks was associated with less albuterol/salbutamol use and fewer night time 
awakenings requiring rescue medication. However, these improvements were not sustained to week 
24, where no difference from placebo was observed. 
Examination of ACQ-5 by score category at each visit showed that a larger proportion of subjects in 
the mepolizumab group compared with the placebo group were in the lowest score category (≤0.75), 
with the exception of Week 6, indicating well-controlled asthma status. Additionally, a larger proportion 
of subjects in the placebo group compared with the mepolizumab group were in the highest score 
category (≥1.5), with the exception of Weeks 1 and 12, indicating not well-controlled asthma status. 
St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) 
At baseline, the mean total SGRQ score was slightly higher in the mepolizumab group (49.6) compared 
with the placebo group (45.0). At the end of the treatment period (Week 24), a larger mean decline 
(improvement) from baseline in SGRQ scores was observed in the mepolizumab arm (-8.8 points) 
compared with the placebo arm (-3.1 points); the treatment difference (-5.8; 95% CI: -10.6, -1.0; p = 
0.019) was greater than the MCID (4-point improvement). 
The cumulative proportion of subjects with ≥4-point improvement in SGRQ at week 24 was also 
greater in the mepolizumab arm (58%) compared with the placebo arm (41%). Furthermore, 45% of 
subjects treated with mepolizumab achieved a ≥10-point improvement in SGRQ compared with 24% 
treated with placebo.

When the SGRQ was examined by domain, larger declines (improvement) from baseline in the Activity, 
Impacts, and Symptoms domain scores were observed with mepolizumab compared with placebo at 
week 24. The Symptoms domain showed the most improvement with mepolizumab treatment. 
Summary of main efficacy studies

Notes 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A combined analysis (meta-analysis using individual patient data) was conducted on the results of the 
two placebo-controlled exacerbation studies of similar design (MEA112997 and MEA115588). The 
objective was to inform on a more precise effect size and to examine effects across subgroups. It used 
the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population consisting of all randomised subjects who received at least one 
dose of study medication and the following treatment comparisons were studied: 
•  75 mg IV vs. Placebo 
•  75 mg IV+100 mg SC vs. Placebo 
•  All mepolizumab doses combined vs. Placebo 
The demographics of the study population in the combined analysis (1192 subjects in total) are 
presented in Table 8. Of note, the number of adolescents was small (26) but there were a total of 105 
elderly patients (9%).

Table 23 
Demographics of the combined analysis population 
Results of the combined analysis showed similar reductions in the rate of clinically significant 
exacerbations (49% for mepolizumab 75 mg IV+100 mg SC and 48% for mepolizumab 75 mg IV; 
p<0.001 for each) to the mepolizumab 100 mg SC dose in MEA115588 (53%, p<0.001) (Table 24). 
Similar reductions in the rate of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation/ED visits were observed in the 
combined analysis (47% for mepolizumab 75 mg IV+100 mg SC and 42% for mepolizumab 75 mg IV; 
p=0.007 and p=0.037, respectively) compared with the mepolizumab 100 mg SC dose in MEA115588 
(61%, p=0.015) (Table 25). 
The combined analysis also showed significant reductions of 50% in the rate of exacerbations requiring 
hospitalisation for mepolizumab 75 mg IV+100 mg SC compared with placebo (p=0.018). There was a 
43% reduction for mepolizumab 75 mg IV compared with placebo (p=0.076). Given the low number of 
events, the combined analysis provided a more robust assessment of the rate of exacerbations 
requiring hospitalisation than the individual studies (Table 26).

Subgroup analyses 
The main subgroup analyses performed are presented for the combined analysis of studies MEA112997 
and MEA115588. These are the rate of clinically significant exacerbations based on subgroups of 
gender, age, bodyweight, region and baseline eosinophils. 
Gender 
It was observed that male subjects tended to have a greater reduction in the rate of clinically 
significant exacerbations over placebo (58% for the mepolizumab 75 mg IV/100 mg SC group; from 
1.76 to 0.74/year) compared with female subjects (45%; from 1.99 to 1.10/year). 
Age 
The effect of mepolizumab  appeared more pronounced in subjects ≥65 years old (76% for the 
mepolizumab 75 mg IV/100 mg SC group; from 2.14 to 0.52/year) than in younger subjects (46%; 
from 1.87 to 1.02/year).

Page 66/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bodyweight 
Regardless of weight at screening, subjects treated with mepolizumab 100 mg SC or 75 mg IV 
achieved a greater reduction in the rate of clinically significant exacerbations than those treated with 
placebo (Table 30). There were no notable differences in the rate of clinically significant exacerbations 
across weight categories.

Blood eosinophils 
The greatest effect was observed in patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥500/µL, who had the 
highest exacerbation rate (2.49/year) whereas the reduction was not or marginally significant in 
patients with baseline blood eosinophils <300/µL, i.e. normal eosinophil levels.

Supportive studies 
The primary objective of the OLE studies was to describe the safety profile of mepolizumab in subjects 
receiving long-term treatment. The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of 
long-term dosing of mepolizumab on a range of clinical markers of asthma control. 
Subjects who completed MEA112997 were offered the opportunity to consent for Study MEA 115666. 
All subjects had experienced a gap of at least 12 months since receiving their last double-blind study 
medication. Subjects who completed either MEA115588 or MEA115575 were offered the opportunity to 
consent for Study MEA115661. The last visit in MEA115588 or MEA115575 served as the baseline visit 
for this study. 
Subjects received 100 mg of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously into the upper arm or upper 
thigh approximately every 4 weeks. During these studies, the commercial product (MDP2) was 
introduced.

Study MEA115666 is still ongoing and the cut-off date for the interim report is 28 February 2014. 
Study MEA115661 has been completed (13 March 2015) and the final report submitted during the 
procedure. 
Study MEA115666 
A total of 347 subjects were enrolled, received at least one dose of study drug, and were included in 
the As Treated (AT) Population. The majority of subjects (325 subjects; 94%) are continuing treatment 
as of the cut-off date. The proportion of subjects withdrawn prematurely was 6%. The most common 
reasons for withdrawal were adverse events (AEs; 8 subjects; 2%) and withdrawal by subject (8 
subjects; 2%). No subjects were withdrawn due to lack of efficacy. 
Subjects have been in the treatment phase for about one year on average and have received a median 
number of 14 injections. All received at least one dose of MDP1 and to date 313 subjects (90%) have 
received at least one dose of MDP2. The length of exposure to MDP1 is about twice that of MDP2  
The mean time since completion of MEA112997 was 18.1 months (SD: 2.70) and the median time was 
17.8 months (range: 12 to 28). During this interim time period, the mean number of self-reported 
exacerbations was 2.7 exacerbations per subject, i.e. an annualised rate of 1.74 exacerbations. A total 
of 280 subjects (81%) experienced at least one exacerbation with 75 subjects (22%) requiring either 
an emergency department (ED) visit or hospitalisation to treat the exacerbation. There were 55 
subjects (16%) that were hospitalised for an asthma exacerbation. 
A total of 151 subjects (44%) experienced 301 on-treatment exacerbations, with an estimated annual 
rate of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.57 to 0.79), i.e. a 61% reduction. There were 25 subjects (7%) who 
experienced 34 exacerbations requiring hospitalisation or an ED visit and 16 subjects (5%) that 
experienced 16 exacerbations requiring hospitalisation after treatment initiation. 
The annualized rate of exacerbations was also calculated by screening blood eosinophil levels. For the 
94 subjects with eosinophils <150 cells/µL, it was higher at 0.82/year (95% CI: 0.61 to 1.11) 
compared to the 243 subjects with eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/µL at 0.59/year (95% CI: 0.48 to 0.72). 
Study MEA115661 
A total of 651 subjects were enrolled, received at least one dose of study drug, and were included in 
the AT Population; 126 subjects had previously participated in Study MEA115575 and 525 subjects had 
previously participated in Study MEA115588. A total of 339 subjects (52%) entered Study 201312, a 
further extension study. Overall, 66 patients (10%) withdrew from the trial; the most common reasons 
for withdrawal were lack of efficacy (19 subjects; 3%), adverse events (11 subjects; 2%) and protocol 
deviation (8 subjects; 1%) including 4 pregnancies. 
Overall, 540 subjects received MDP1 and 635 subjects received MDP2; 111 subjects (17%) received 
MDP2 from Visit 1. The median number of mepolizumab injections was 13, 3 with MDP1 (range 1-9) 
and 10 with MDP2 (range 1–14). 
A total of 311 subjects (48%) experienced 654 on-treatment exacerbations and the estimated 
exacerbation rate per year was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.83 to 1.04); it was similar in patients previously 
treated with mepolizumab (0.90; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.04) and placebo (0.99; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.18). Fifty-
nine subjects (9%) experienced 95 exacerbations requiring hospitalisation or an ED visit and 39 
subjects (6%) experienced 65 exacerbations requiring hospitalisation. 
Overall, 121 patients from study MEA115575 had OCS data up to week 52. At the end of the double-
blind period, the median OCS dose was 10 mg/day in the placebo arm and 2.5 mg/day in the 
mepolizumab arm; during the open label period, it fluctuated between 2.5 and 4 mg/day in patients

previously treated with mepolizumab whereas it gradually decreased to 5 mg/day in patients having 
previously received placebo. 
Finally, improvements in lung function and ACQ-5 score were sustained. 
Combined analysis 
A combined analysis of blood eosinophil data collected prior to 28 February 2014 (data cut-off) was 
performed for the ongoing MEA115666 and MEA115661 studies. The purpose of this analysis was to 
investigate whether there was any change in effect on blood eosinophils following introduction of the 
commercial product (MDP2) into these studies. There was no change in the geometric mean blood 
eosinophil level between the last measurement with MDP1 and the first measurement with MDP2 
(geometric mean ratio for MEA115566+MEA115661=1.01) (Table 33), indicating that the two drug 
products were comparable in their pharmacodynamic effect.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application is based on three pivotal placebo-controlled trials in severe refractory asthma, for 
which the applicant received CHMP scientific advice. Two trials investigated the effect of mepolizumab 
on exacerbations (exacerbation trials, MEA 112997 and MEA 115588) and a third trial investigated its 
potential corticosteroid sparing effect (MEA 115575). The study population of these three trials had 
severe uncontrolled refractory asthma defined in accordance with current guidelines: International 
ERS/ATS guidelines on definition, evaluation and treatment of severe asthma (ATS, 2014) and Global 
Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention, Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA, 2014). These 
patients required treatment with high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a second controller (plus 
systemic corticosteroids in the third trial), and in spite of this treatment, had persistent airflow 
obstruction and, in the first two trials, a history of frequent (at least two per year) exacerbations 
requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or hospitalisation or emergency department visit (i.e. 
‘severe exacerbations’). 
Based on published literature, it is known that only patients with an eosinophilic asthma phenotype 
would be likely to benefit from therapy with an anti-IL-5 antibody such as mepolizumab. The first 
exacerbation trial (MEA 112997) included a range of criteria susceptible to define this particular 
phenotype and, based on the results of this trial, two criteria were selected for the enrolment of 
subjects in the two subsequent trials (exacerbation (MEA 115588) and OCS sparing studies (MEA 
115575)). This criteria were either an elevated peripheral blood eosinophil count of ≥300/µL in the 
previous 12 months or an elevated peripheral blood eosinophil count of ≥ 150/µL at study entry, if 
they were considered related to asthma. 
The duration of the exacerbation trials was initially planned to be 12 months, in line with current CHMP 
guideline (Guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of asthma; 
CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1), but was shortened to 8 months in the second trial. Based on a post-hoc 
analysis of the data from the first trial (MEA 112997) the applicant showed that the treatment 
response to mepolizumab was marginally affected by seasonal changes in exacerbation frequency, and 
therefore, it was accepted that the duration of the second trial (MEA 11115588) was shortened. 8 
months was considered adequate period of time to demonstrate a reduction in the rate of clinically 
significant exacerbations for patients receiving mepolizumab. 
The main efficacy endpoints were the same in both trials. The primary endpoint of ‘clinically significant 
exacerbations’ corresponded to ‘severe exacerbations’ as defined in ATS guideline (2014) and CHMP 
guideline (Guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of Asthma 
(CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1). This definition included an objective verification of the deterioration of 
asthma symptoms as reflected in the patient eDiary data, but in the absence of deterioration criteria as 
defined in the protocol, the investigator provided information to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor as to 
why the exacerbation was to be considered clinically significant; this only occurred in 2-8% of the 
exacerbations depending on the trial. The CHMP agreed that this was the most important outcome in 
this patient population because severe exacerbations constitute the greatest risk to patients.  
The main secondary endpoints were lung function tests (FEV1), asthma symptoms measured in the 
Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and quality of life assessed with the standardised Asthma Quality 
of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ(S) in MEA 112997 and the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) 
in MEA 115588. These were all validated questionnaires and the CHMP considered appropriate all the 
secondary endpoints.

The trials were randomised and blinded to the patient and personnel involved in the study drug 
administration and patient assessment; only the pharmacist preparing the study drug was unblinded. 
This blinding method had a limitation that could not be overcome as it would not be impossible for 
investigators to distinguish between placebo and active based on blood eosinophil counts. Of note, 
blood eosinophil counts were performed centrally and the investigators were not communicated the 
results after randomisation. 
The first exacerbation trial, MEA 112997, studied three intravenous doses (75 mg, 250 mg and 750 
mg) of mepolizumab administered monthly. These doses were selected on the basis of previous trials 
that had shown some clinical effect at the two highest doses. The aim was to investigate the dose-
response relationship on PD and efficacy outcomes. This study was considered critical by the CHMP to 
allow for the development of a mechanistic model for the binding of mepolizumab to IL-5, its impact on 
blood or sputum eosinophil count and, most importantly, on clinical outcome, with the aim of 
establishing a target absolute or relative blood eosinophil value that could be used to support dose 
selection. However, these objectives were not achieved and no difference in clinical effects was 
observed between the three doses. Therefore, the lowest dose was selected for further development 
based on PKPD modelling (see sections 2.4.2 and 2.4.3). 
The second exacerbation trial, MEA 115588, tested monthly doses of 75 mg IV and 100 mg SC using a 
double-dummy design. These two doses were expected to produce a similar exposure as the absolute 
bioavailability of the SC route had been shown to be approximately 75% in the PK/PD study MEA 
114092 (see section 2.4.2). Furthermore, this study had indicated that these doses provided the same 
pharmacological response (i.e., the ID90 for maximum achievable pharmacological effect). 
The third trial, study MEA 115575, was designed to investigate the corticosteroid sparing effect of 
mepolizumab in patients requiring at least 5 mg/day of oral prednisone or equivalent. The trial 
included before randomisation, an OCS optimization phase of 3-10 weeks to establish the lowest OCS 
dose needed to control the patient’s symptoms. After randomisation, this dose had to be maintained 
for 4 weeks before the OCS reduction phase was started following a pre-defined algorithm. This phase 
lasted 16 weeks and was followed by a maintenance phase of 4 weeks without any dose adjustment, 
during which the evaluation of outcomes was conducted. 
This was considered a short period to evaluate the durability of the effect; however data from the open 
label extension study (MEA 115661) were subsequently submitted during the procedure. 
The primary endpoint in this trial was the relative reduction in OCS dose compared with the baseline 
dose provided no severe exacerbation occurred during these 4 weeks, which is not considered a 
stringent definition of asthma control. While the CHMP endorsed the study design, it also advised that 
the absolute decrease in OCS would be a key secondary endpoint and that this should be clinically 
meaningful and evaluated in relation to the baseline dose. These data were submitted by the applicant 
in response to CHMP request during the procedure. 
The three trials were multinational but the EU was the largest contributor in terms of recruitment. 
Open label extension of the three studies is ongoing. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Population 
The two exacerbation trials (MEA 112997 and MEA 115588) included 1192 patients, mostly female 
(60%), white (84%), and overweight (mean BMI=28.1 kg/m2). The mean age was 49 years (range: 
12-82 years); the number of adolescents was small (n=26) but elderly patients (n=105) contributed 
9% of the study population. Overall, 54% of the patients had suffered from asthma for more than 15

years and 55% had ≥3 exacerbations in the 12 months prior to screening (mean 3.6). About one third 
of the patients were taking continuous OCS with a median prednisone-equivalent dose of 10 mg/day.  
Although the criteria defining the eosinophilic phenotype were different between the two exacerbation 
studies (MEA 112997 and MEA 115588), asthma severity as reflected by the proportion of patients 
with ≥3 severe exacerbations (54% vs. 57%), at least one hospitalisation (24% vs 19%) during the 
previous 12 months, mean FEV1 (60% vs 61%) and mean ACQ-score (2.4 vs. 2.2) was comparable 
between the two studies .Only concomitant OCS use was slightly more frequent in study MEA 112997 
than study MEA 115588 (31% vs 24%). 
Most patients were receiving the combination ICS/LABA (57% and 40%, respectively) or the 
combination plus an additional non-LABA controller (38% and 57%, respectively); the mean dose of 
equivalent fluticasone propionate was 1122 and 1085 mcg ex-valve, respectively. Treatment arms 
were well balanced with regard to demographics and asthma exacerbation history. 
Most patients completed the studies: 84% in Study MEA112997 and 94% in Study 115588. The main 
reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent and adverse event, which were balanced across 
treatment arms. The proportion of patients excluded from the PP analysis set for major deviations was 
low (4-5%); these were mainly related to the eligibility criteria (insufficient documentation of 
exacerbations or high ICS doses during the previous year, FEV1 or blood eosinophil count not meeting 
the inclusion criteria). The primary analysis was performed in a modified ITT population (all patients 
having received at least one dose of study drug), which the CHMP considered acceptable. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was met in both studies (MEA 112997 and MEA 115588) and the relative 
reduction in the frequency of severe exacerbations was consistent across the studies at approximately 
50% although in absolute terms the annual rate decreased from 2.40 on placebo to 1.24 (75 mg IV) in 
the study MEA 112997 but from only 1.74 (lower than the expected ≥ 2/year) to 0.88 in the study 
MEA115588 (75 mg IV/100 mg SC).  
Importantly, the results were comparable in patients treated with 75 mg IV and 100 mg SC. In the 
combined analysis (ITT population) of these two trials, the rate ratio (mepolizumab/placebo) was 0.51 
(95%CI: 0.42, 0.62; p<0.001) in the pooled 75 mg IV/100 mg SC arm and a similar ratio (0.53; 
95%CI: 0.33, 0.84; p=0.007) was estimated for the exacerbations requiring hospitalisation/ED visit. 
Analyses in the PP population and other sensitivity analyses resulted in the same statistical inferences 
on the primary endpoint, and therefore, the CHMP considered this result to be robust. 
The first trial (MEA112997) failed to show any dose-response relationship of the primary outcome 
across the doses investigated and the exposure achieved. However there was evidence of an increased 
reduction in blood eosinophils (from 78% to 88% compared to placebo) with increasing dose of 
mepolizumab, albeit from already high inhibition. Eight weeks after the last dose, blood eosinophil 
reduction was still 62% at the 75 mg dose, implying maintenance of the effect in the event of a missed 
dose. The results of this trial indicated a flat dose-response curve over the tested range (75 – 750 
mg). The probability of a first clinically significant exacerbation by Weeks 16, 32 and 52 was lower in 
the three mepolizumab arms than in the placebo arm, suggesting that the reduction in exacerbation 
was evident early in the study.  
The 100 mg SC dose, which was selected to be comparable to 75 mg IV based on the estimated SC 
absolute bioavailability, was found in the study MEA 114092 to provide approximately 90% of maximal 
pharmacology, and by implication efficacy; for antagonistic mechanisms (including IL-5 neutralisation) 
this is a desirable target for therapeutic benefit [Grimwood, 2009] (see section 2.4.3). In the first trial 
Assessment report

Page 74/101 
 
 
 
 
 
(MEA112997), the exploratory multivariable modelling analysis of baseline factors that could predict 
the effect of mepolizumab on exacerbations found two significant factors: baseline blood eosinophil 
count and number of exacerbations in the year prior to study. Among those with a history of exactly 
two exacerbations in the previous year, there appeared to be a benefit in subjects with a baseline level 
of blood eosinophils above 150 cells/µL. The addition of the criterion of blood eosinophils ≥ 300 
cells/µL during the previous year allowed to select additional patients that showed some benefit, 
although much smaller. These two criteria were used in the two subsequent pivotal trials (MEA115588 
and MEA115575). 
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary endpoints did not provide consistent results between the two exacerbation trials 
(MEA112997 and MEA 115588). In the first trial (MEA112997), similar improvements were observed 
throughout the study in the placebo and mepolizumab arms for FEV1, ACQ-6 score and AQLQ score. Of 
note, the improvement in ACQ and AQLQ was clinically relevant (>0.5) in all arms including placebo. 
This finding was in line with those of earlier trials, which had not shown significant benefit on lung 
function and asthma symptoms. Although mepolizumab reduces sputum and blood eosinophil counts, it 
has little benefit in terms of airways function as conventionally measured. However it is acknowledged 
to have a demonstrable benefit on the frequency of acute asthma exacerbations. The disconnection 
between the two is counterintuitive but the CHMP acknowledged that the relationship between airway 
inflammation, lung function and symptoms is weak [Crimi, 1998; Rosi, 2000; Ronchi 1997]. 
In the second exacerbation trial (MEA115588), the improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was 
numerically greater on mepolizumab than placebo but the difference was not consistent throughout the 
study. Nevertheless, at week 32 (last visit) the mean increase in the placebo arm was 86 mL vs. 183 
mL in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC arm (p = 0.028). The difference was more important for the post-
bronchodilator FEV1 as the improvement on placebo was marginal (30 mL) compared to 167 mL in the 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC arm (p = 0.004). 
While the ACQ score improvement was similar in the placebo arm to that observed in the first trial, it 
appeared significantly greater in the mepolizumab arms from week 4 to week 32 of this trial. At the 
last visit, the mean improvement from baseline was 0.50 in the placebo arm and 0.94 in the 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC (p<0.001) although the difference (0.44) did not exceed the MCID (0.5). 
The quality of life questionnaire used in the second trial (SGRQ) was different from the AQLQ used in 
the first trial. According to the applicant, it was selected for its emphasis on disease impact in patients 
with exacerbating severe asthma. At the last visit, the improvement was significantly greater in 
patients treated with mepolizumab compared to those on placebo (p < 0.001). A clinically relevant 
improvement (≥4-point) was reported by 71% of patients in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC arm vs 55% 
in the placebo arm. 
The differences between the two trials regarding improvement in lung function, asthma control and 
quality of life could not be explained by the applicant although it was speculated that this could be due 
to “better defined specific hematologic and clinical markers targeted to select mepolizumab treatment 
responders” in the second trial. Also, SGRQ may be more suitable for measuring impacted quality of 
life domains in severe asthma. 
Nevertheless, the two exacerbation trials showed robust evidence of reduction in the frequency of 
severe exacerbations, a key outcome in the control of severe asthma, which was considered clinically 
meaningful by the CHMP. However, in the second trial (MEA115588) an annual rate of less than 2 
severe exacerbations per year was observed on the placebo arm (not consistent with the target 
population). Explanatory factors to this could be a difference in the prevalence of circulating

respiratory-related viruses between the study years or the different definition of the eosinophilic 
phenotype. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint were conducted in the combined analysis. The effect of 
mepolizumab appeared broadly similar in both genders (although it tended to be lower in females than 
in males) and was not influenced by bodyweight. Importantly, the effect was notably greater in elderly 
subjects, who appeared to suffer from more frequent exacerbations (2.14/year) on placebo compared 
to younger subjects (1.87/year). In addition, in study MEA115588, the percent reduction was 56% - 
70% in patients with at least 3 exacerbations in the previous year vs. 47% in patients with only 2 
exacerbations in the previous year. 
The literature suggests that airway eosinophilia is more prevalent in severe adult-onset asthma. 
Indeed, the number of adolescents was too small (n=26) to allow for proper evaluation of 
mepolizumab in this age group (12-17 years), and therefore, the proposed indication is currently 
restricted to adults. In study MEA115588, 25 adolescents, 13 girls and 12 boys, 9 aged 12 -14 years 
and 16 aged 15 – 17 years were enrolled. Of note, the inclusion criterion regarding the definition of 
high doses of ICS (i.e., half the doses of adults) did not correspond to current treatment guidelines in 
this age group: ATS (2014) and GINA (2014) guidelines. Of the total 25 subjects, 9 received placebo, 
9 received mepolizumab 75mg IV, and 7 100 mg SC. The same proportion of subjects (3/9) receiving 
placebo and mepolizumab IV reported clinically significant exacerbations but none in those receiving 
mepolizumab SC.  
The greatest effect (73% reduction) was observed in patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥500/µL, 
who had the highest exacerbation rate (2.49/year) in the placebo arm (vs. 0.67/year in the treated 
patients)whereas the reduction was much smaller (~ 30%)  in patients with baseline blood eosinophils 
<300/µL, i.e. normal eosinophil levels. Furthermore, in Study MEA115588, the effect of mepolizumab 
was marginal (exacerbations reduced by 18% in the SC arm and no effect at all in the IV arm) in the 
small subgroup of patients with only a history of elevated blood eosinophils during the previous 12 
months (but screening blood eosinophil levels <150/µL); this result did not confirm the small effect 
observed in the first trial (MEA112997) in a similar subgroup where the exacerbation rate was reduced 
by 26%. 
Definition of the target population 
The definition of eosinophilic asthma is based on the pattern of inflammatory cellular infiltrate in the 
airway and induced sputum cell count is the gold standard for identifying eosinophilic inflammation. In 
spite of being associated to sputum eosinophils, blood eosinophil counts are generally considered poor 
predictors of sputum eosinophilic inflammation. However, in patients with severe asthma receiving 
very high doses of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, a blood eosinophil count of greater than 450 
cells/µL has recently been shown to correctly predict sputum eosinophilia in 9 of 10 cases [Fowler S ; 
2015]. Furthermore, as blood eosinophil counts are easily available, they constitute a more actionable 
marker of the target population in clinical practice. Finally, systemic inflammation may play an 
independent role in these patients. Therefore, the use of blood eosinophil counts to define the target 
population for mepolizumab was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
However, the applicant’s proposal of a dual blood eosinophil count threshold (either a blood eosinophil 
count ≥150 cells/µL at initiation of treatment or a blood eosinophil count ≥300 cells/µL in the prior 12 
months) was not considered sufficiently supported by the data submitted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 76/101 
 
 
 
 
 
Evidence from large studies has recently been emerging that suggests high blood eosinophil count 
(higher than 300 – 400 cells/ µL) is associated with more frequent asthma attacks. Indeed, a similar 
trend for severe exacerbations was observed in the mepolizumab placebo controlled studies where in 
the placebo arms, a rate of ≥ 2 exacerbations/year was consistently reported only in patients with 
baseline blood eosinophil levels ≥ 300 cells/µL. Importantly, subgroup analyses by baseline eosinophil 
count showed that the response to mepolizumab improved as the baseline blood eosinophil count 
increased (table 32). These data was reflected in detail in section 5.1 of the SmPC. However, the CHMP 
considered that these were not sufficient to define a definitive threshold for the selection of the patient 
population susceptible to respond to mepolizumab. 
Mepolizumab is indicated for adult patients with severe refractory asthma characterised by an 
eosinophilic phenotype. The diagnosis of the phenotype is left to health care professionals specialised 
in the treatment of severe asthma based on sputum or blood eosinophilia. The magnitude of 
mepolizumab effect on severe exacerbations in relation to blood eosinophil levels is described in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC to further inform their therapeutic decision. 
Corticosteroid sparing trial (MEA 115575) 
Population 
This was a small trial which included only 135 subjects, who had similar characteristics to those in the 
exacerbation trials. The two treatment arms did not appear well matched for a number of screening 
and baseline characteristics. The gender ratio was atypical in the placebo arm with more males than 
females. In the previous year, asthma seemed more severe in the mepolizumab arm with patients 
having more exacerbations, urgent care visits and oral steroid bursts. However, lung function at 
screening appeared slightly better in this arm. Furthermore, the median daily OCS dose after 
optimization was lower in the mepolizumab arm (10 mg) than in the placebo arm (12.5 mg) and 12 vs 
6 patients, respectively, were on the lowest dose of 5 mg. The baseline ACQ score and blood 
eosinophils were higher in the mepolizumab arm. 
Most patients (95%) completed the trial but there was a high level of protocol deviations, in particular 
regarding the OCS dosing algorithm (25%). In particular, 10 patients entered the trial on non-optimal 
OCS dose (6 (9%) in the mepolizumab arm and 4 (6%) in the placebo arm) and were excluded from 
the PP analysis. A further 13 patients had their OCS dose not stepped up post-exacerbation, which 
may have overestimated the dose reduction; these were not excluded from the PP analysis but 
occurred equally in both treatment arms. 
OCS reduction 
The primary endpoint, i.e. the relative (%) OCS reduction, was significantly greater in the 
mepolizumab arm compared to placebo in the ITT population with an odds ratio of 2.39 (95%CI: 1.25, 
4.56; p = 0.008); 64% of the patients treated with mepolizumab experienced some level of reduction 
vs. 44% in the placebo arm. However, the results were far less compelling when the patients entered 
the trial with an appropriate OCS dose (PP population) as the lower limit of the CI was barely over 1. 
The secondary endpoints did not show compelling reduction of the OCS dose either. In the 
mepolizumab arm, 37/69 (54%) subjects achieved a daily dose ≤5 mg (vs. 21/66 (32%) on placebo) 
but already 12 (17%) were receiving 5 mg/day at baseline. The proportion of subjects weaned off was 
low and not substantially different (around 10%) in the two treatment arms, especially considering the 
number of patients with a baseline daily dose of 5 mg in the mepolizumab arm. The fact that a number 
of patients on placebo were able to successfully withdraw from OCS questioned their CS dependence 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 77/101 
 
 
 
 
 
but similar proportions on placebo (~ 10%) have been reported in other OCS sparing trials (e.g. 
Bateman E, 2006). 
The median daily OCS dose decreased from 10 mg to 3 mg in the mepolizumab arm (12.5 mg to 10 
mg in the placebo arm); a median reduction of 5 mg/day was reported in the mepolizumab arm while 
in the placebo arm, it was 0. The median reduction was the same whatever the level of the baseline 
OCS dose. Overall, ~40% of the mepolizumab-treated patients had a reduction > 5 mg/day (twice as 
many as in the placebo arm), and this is considered clinically relevant. 
Other endpoints 
During the 6-month treatment period, the frequency of clinically significant exacerbations was reduced 
on mepolizumab (1.44/year) compared to placebo (2.12/year) although the difference was barely 
significant (rate ratio = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.99; p = 0.042). Furthermore, the median duration and 
dose of systemic CS associated with these exacerbations tended to be greater in the mepolizumab arm 
(8.5 days and 260 mg, respectively) than in the placebo arm (8 days and 237.5 mg, respectively). This 
was in contrast with the number of hospitalisations (7 on placebo vs. none on mepolizumab) but the 
numbers were too small to draw a definite conclusion. 
In the placebo arm, there was no change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 but post-bronchodilator FEV1 
deteriorated whereas both parameters increased by approximately 100 mL on average in the 
mepolizumab arm at 24 weeks. At this time point, the difference vs. placebo was not statistically 
significant although between Weeks 4 to 16 differences in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 were observed to 
be significant between the mepolizumab and placebo arms. 
Similarly, no change in asthma control in the placebo arm was observed while a significant and 
clinically meaningful improvement in the ACQ score was reported with mepolizumab compared to 
placebo (-0.52; 95% CI: -0.17, -0.87; p=0.004). However, the proportion of patients with poor 
asthma control (ACQ score ≥1.5) was still around 40% in the mepolizumab arm at the last two visits 
(week 20 and 24). In addition, and similar to pre-bronchodilator FEV1, the reduction in 
albuterol/salbutamol use and night time awakenings requiring rescue medication was not sustained 
after Week 12 as no difference from placebo was observed at Week 24; longer term data from the 
extension study will be provided post-authorisation to clearly demonstrate that there is maintenance of 
efficacy beyond 24 weeks. 
The quality of life evaluation (SGRQ) showed a significant and clinically meaningful improvement with 
mepolizumab compared to placebo (-5.8; 95% CI: -1.0, -10.6; p = 0.019). 
Subgroup analyses 
Given the small size of the subgroups, the results of these analyses should be interpreted with caution. 
Nevertheless, the effect of mepolizumab in female patients, who are generally more affected with 
severe asthma than males, was marginal and not statistically significant. In the combined analysis of 
the exacerbation studies, a 12% difference was noted between the reduction rates reported for female 
and male patients in favour of the latter. However, there is no biological PK or PD rationale to explain 
this finding. 
The effect of mepolizumab was mainly observed in subjects with shorter OCS use (<5 years) and high 
OCS doses (≥ 15mg/day). In the largest subgroup of patients with mid baseline OCS dose (10 - <15 
mg), mepolizumab did not show any effect (OR = 1.07) but this is likely a chance finding. 
The CHMP acknowledged that blood eosinophil levels are difficult to interpret in patients taking OCS as 
they are generally very low. However, 29% of the patients had baseline levels ≥ 500/µL after dose 
Assessment report

Page 78/101 
 
 
 
 
 
optimization. These levels questioned either non-adherence (very common in these patients) or 
another diagnosis (e.g. Churg Strauss syndrome). However, in the other mepolizumab studies (studies 
MEA 112997 and MEA 115588), a similar proportion (28-33%) of patients on maintenance OCS 
exhibited high levels of blood eosinophils. Furthermore, this observation was corroborated by published 
literature [Taille, 2013]. 
Regarding the magnitude of treatment effect by baseline blood eosinophils and by inclusion criterion, 
results did not appear consistent with those observed in the exacerbation studies and given the small 
size of the subgroups are likely to be chance findings. 
During the procedure the CHMP requested further data and justification on the OCS sparing effect in 
this trial (study MEA 115575). The applicant submitted the requested data. Overall, the CHMP 
considered that although the results were not compelling, the OCS sparing effect was statistically 
significant and could be considered clinically meaningful. 
Extension studies 
The interim data submitted for the two ongoing OLE studies provided additional efficacy information. 
The first study (MEA115666) enrolled patients from the first exacerbation trial (MEA112997) after a 
treatment interruption of 12 to 28 months (median 18 months) during which the exacerbation rate 
increased. Mepolizumab at the recommended posology was able to reduce the exacerbation rate again. 
The mean exposure at the cut-off date of the interim report was approximately one year. 
The second study (MEA115661), which enrolled patients from the two Phase III trials (MEA115588 and 
MEA115575) without treatment interruption for an additional 52 weeks of therapy, was completed 
during the procedure. It showed sustained effects on exacerbation rates, lung function and ACQ score. 
In addition, during the open label period, the median OCS dose in corticosteroid-dependent patients 
previously treated with mepolizumab was more or less stable within a range of 2.5 to 4 mg/day during 
the six months following the double-blind study. 
Finally, as the commercial product was introduced during these studies, blood eosinophil determination 
before and after the switch was described to confirm that the PD effect of the commercial product was 
comparable to that of the product used during the pivotal trials. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the three pivotal efficacy trials submitted, the CHMP considered that mepolizumab has 
demonstrated a clinically relevant effect on the frequency of exacerbations in patients with severe 
refractory asthma and frequent exacerbations (at least 2 per year). However, the applicant’s criterion 
regarding specific levels of the blood eosinophil count to define the target population was not endorsed 
by the CHMP.  
The CHMP considered that the data provided were not sufficient to define a definitive threshold for the 
selection of the patient population susceptible to respond to mepolizumab. The wording of the 
indication agreed by the CHMP and reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC is as follows: 
Nucala is indicated in adult patients as an add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma 
(see section 5.1) 
Based on additional data during the procedure provided by the applicant, the CHMP considered that 
mepolizumab treatment exerts some degree of corticosteroid sparing effect as it achieved a median 
reduction of 5 mg/day (prednisone equivalent) regardless of the baseline OCS level (up to 30 mg/day) 
taken by These patients.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data of mepolizumab administered to subjects across a range of diseases was submitted for this 
Application but the primary analysis was the safety data from the severe eosinophilic asthma 
development program where integrated safety data was presented in two sets of studies : Placebo-
controlled severe asthma studies (MEA112997, MEA115588 and MEA 115575) and Open-label 
Extension (OLE) studies (MEA115661 and MEA115666). The safety population was defined as all 
subjects who received at least one dose of mepolizumab.  
Patient exposure 
A total of 2022 subjects have received at least one dose of mepolizumab in the applicant-sponsored 
studies and 661 subjects have received placebo. Overall, 1229 subjects with severe eosinophilic 
asthma received at least one dose of mepolizumab and 1018 of these 1229 subjects received 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC, either as part of a randomised placebo-controlled study or in an open-label 
extension to these studies. 
Total treatment exposure for the 1018 subjects who received mepolizumab 100 mg SC was 1131 
subject years. A total of 138 subjects (14%) were treated with mepolizumab 100 mg SC up to 12 
months and 880 subjects (86%) were treated for 12 months to less than 24 months. 
Table 34 displays the number and percentage of subjects treated with mepolizumab by indication and 
dose.  
Table 34: Subjects treated by Indication and Dose (All studies combined, safety population) 
Adverse events 
Common AEs were defined as those which occurred in ≥3% of subjects in a given treatment group. 
The incidence of common AEs in the placebo controlled severe asthma studies was similar for the 
placebo group (82%) compared with the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (79%), and the mepolizumab 
75 mg IV group (83%). Headache and nasopharyngitis were the most frequently reported AEs in the 
placebo controlled severe asthma studies. These events were all non-serious, mild to moderate in 
intensity and the majority resolved within a few days. The common symptoms reported with these 
events included pain, erythema, swelling, itching, and burning sensation (Table 35). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 80/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall incidence of subjects reporting the onset of an AE declined as time on treatment increased, 
but the pattern of AEs remained similar. 
When adjusted for study difference as well as exposure, relative risks of more than 2 for mepolizumab 
compared with placebo were observed for three events: eczema, nasal congestion, and dyspnoea. All 
other relative risks were less than 2. 
The SOC AE profile for both males and females was similar to the overall population. The number of 
adolescent subjects (n=0 to 9 across treatment groups; total receiving mepolizumab, n= 19) and 
elderly subjects (n=3 to 38 across treatment groups; total receiving mepolizumab, n=82) enrolled in 
the severe asthma studies was too limited to characterise the safety profile of mepolizumab in this 
population. The incidence of AEs in all SOCs was similar for subjects 18 to 64 years of age (total 
subjects receiving mepolizumab, n= 814) compared with the overall population.  
The incidence of AEs in all SOCs was similar for white subjects (total 783 subjects receiving 
mepolizumab) compared with the overall population.  
The total number of subjects receiving mepolizumab in the EU was 438, in the ROW 371 and in the US 
106. The proportion of US subjects reporting AEs was higher than the overall population.

Note: AEs that are shaded occurred either (i) at an incidence of <3% in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC and 75 mg IV 
groups  or  (ii)  3%  or  more  in  the  mepolizumab  100  mg  SC  or  75  mg  IV  groups,  but  less  than  or  equal  to  the 
incidence in the placebo group. 
The ADRs included in section 4.8 of the SmPC were determined via a two-step process: Firstly, AEs 
that occurred at an incidence of ≥3% in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group and were more common 
than placebo were identified. Secondly, common (≥3%) AEs in all doses of the randomised placebo-
controlled studies (n=915) were cross-referenced.  
Common adverse events that were also elevated in the more extensive exposure population (relative 
risks) were considered adverse reactions and were considered for inclusion in the SmPC. 
Long-term safety 
The overall incidence of subjects reporting the onset of an AE declined as time on treatment increased, 
but the pattern of AEs remained similar. 
During the procedure the final clinical study report for the open-label extension study MEA115661 was 
submitted. The incidence and type of adverse events seen in study MEA115661 were similar to those 
seen in the placebo-controlled severe asthma studies. No new safety signals of concern were identified. 
‘Limited data in long-term safety of 100mg SC dose’ was included in the RMP as missing information. 
Two ongoing long-term OLE studies (MEA115666 and 201312) are ongoing with the intent to further 
characterise the long-term safety of mepolizumab treatment in severe eosinophilic asthma. 
Deaths 
Data was provided during the procedure and the latest cut-off date was 6 May 2015. A total of 8 
deaths have been reported in the placebo controlled severe asthma studies (n=5) and in OLE studies 
(n=3).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 83/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two deaths were in subjects receiving placebo. None of the deaths were considered to be related to 
mepolizumab by the investigator. Of the 6 deaths in subjects receiving mepolizumab both in the 
placebo controlled severe asthma studies and in the OLE studies: 
•  One subject had undergone treatment for uterine carcinosarcoma and died of severe acute 
pancreatitis and septic shock;  
•  One subject committed suicide;  
•  One subject died following a severe respiratory arrest 244 days after the first dose of 
treatment and 21 days after the last dose which was assessed as due to his underlying 
asthma;  
•  One subject with a history of severe uncontrolled asthma experienced a fatal SAE of severe 
acute asthma exacerbation approximately 11 hours after receiving the second infusion (250mg 
IV) of mepolizumab. The subject was assessed as well (including asthma parameters) on the 
day of the last infusion; 
•  One subject experienced complications due to morbid obesity and died approximately 2.3 years 
since the first dose of mepolizumab and 15 days after the most recent dose; 
•  One subject died of acute heart failure subsequent to coronary heart disease approximately 19 
months after the first dose of mepolizumab and 8 days after the most recent dose. 
A total of 33 deaths have been reported in the mepolizumab clinical development program (which 
includes patients in the severe asthma and HES programmes). Eight deaths were in the severe asthma 
studies described above. From the remaining 25 deaths, 20 were patients who participated in the HES 
compassionate use program who have life-threatening disease, and have failed other available 
therapies. The compassionate use program was initiated in 2001 and is currently ongoing. 
Other serious adverse events 
Table 36 shows the on-treatment SAEs occurring in more than one subject in the placebo-controlled 
severe asthma studies. The incidence of serious adverse events in the placebo-controlled severe 
asthma studies was lower in the 100mg SC and 75mg IV mepolizumab groups than in the placebo 
group.

Adverse events of special interest 
They were selected by on the results of the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) -adjusted relative risks of 
on treatment SAEs and AEs for all doses of mepolizumab combined compared with placebo and 
mepolizumab 100mg SC and 75 IV compared with placebo in placebo controlled severe asthma studies 
(Figures 14 and 15). The SAEs and AEs of special interest within mepolizumab program for subjects 
with severe eosinophilic asthma are described below. Clinical impact of immunogenicity was also of 
special interest.

•  Systemic (allergic/hypersensitivity and non-allergic) and local site reactions 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 86/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall risk of systemic allergic and non-allergic reactions with mepolizumab appeared to be low. 
In the OLE studies one serious type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction with an onset of reaction 3 
days after the 9th dose of mepolizumab was reported that required treatment in intensive care unit 
(ICU).  
In placebo-controlled severe asthma studies, local site reactions were reported for more subjects in the 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (21 subjects, 8%) compared with the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group 
(11 subjects 3%) and the placebo group (14 subjects, 3%).  
• 
Infections 
The occurrence of AEs in the ‘Infections and Infestations’ SOC was 58% in the placebo group, 52% in 
the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group, and 61% in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group. Thirty-seven 
subjects reported non-fatal SAEs in the ‘Infections and Infestations’ SOC, with an incidence of 3% each 
in the placebo and mepolizumab 100 mg SC groups and 2% in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group.  
Opportunistic infections were infrequent and were reported for 4 subjects (<1%) in the placebo group, 
3 subjects (1%) in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group and 4 subjects (1%) in the mepolizumab 75 mg 
IV group. The only opportunistic infection that occurred in more than one subject was herpes zoster, 
occurring in 4 subjects (1%) in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group and 2 subjects each (<1%) in the 
placebo and mepolizumab 100 mg SC groups. 
Eosinophils may be involved in the immunological host response to some helminth infections; however, 
the clinical studies of this application were not designed to study the effect of mepolizumab on risk for 
or response to treatment for helminth infections; as subjects with known parasitic infections were 
excluded from participation in the clinical studies. The helminth infection rate in the overall clinical 
program was less than 1 in 1000 subjects. The one report of ‘parasitic gastroenteritis’ treated with 
albendazole was in a subject in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group in the study MEA115588, although 
no testing was done to confirm the diagnosis. The event was reported as non-serious and treatment 
with mepolizumab was continued. 
•  Malignancies 
In the placebo controlled studies, neoplasms were reported by 2% of subjects in the placebo group, 
<1% of subjects in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group, and 1% of subjects in the mepolizumab 75 mg 
IV group. Malignancies were reported by 3 subjects (<1%) in the placebo group and 1 subject (<1%) 
in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group. The types of malignancies reported were those that are common 
in the general population. None of the types of malignancies were reported in more than one subject. 
In the OLE Studies, neoplasms (both benign and malignant) were reported by 20 subjects (2%). 
Malignancies were reported by 9 subjects (<1%). The types of malignancies reported were basal cell 
carcinoma, bladder cancer, endometrial cancer, breast cancer, basosquamous carcinoma, gastric 
cancer, prostate cancer and squamous cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma and breast cancer was the 
only malignancy that was reported in more than one subject (n=2). 
•  Serious Cardiac, Vascular, Thromboembolic (CVT) and ischaemic events 
In study MEA112997, a numeric imbalance in the number of subjects with serious cardiac events was 
observed for mepolizumab (7/461) compared with placebo (1/155). These events were predominantly 
ischemic in nature. With the exception of one subject, these events were reported in subjects with CV 
risk factors at baseline. Further review of all CVT and ischemic SAEs showed that similar numbers of 
subjects experienced events from these SOCs across all treatment groups when events from other 
SOCs were considered. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 87/101 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to the imbalance in serious cardiac events observed in this study a CV monitoring strategy was 
implemented during the subsequent Phase III program (i.e. in the studies MEA115588, MEA115575, 
MEA115661, and MEA115666). The overall CV events reported from the two double blind studies (MEA 
115588 and MEA 115575) were not sufficient to provide an assessment and it is continued to be 
monitored in the ongoing OLE studies. Table 37 provides and overview of the CVT and ischaemic SAEs 
in placebo-controlled severe asthma studies. 
Table 37:  
Overview of cardiac, vascular, thromboembolic and Ischaemic SAEs (placebo-controlled 
severe asthma studies) 
The only ischemic SAEs that were reported by more than one subject were cerebrovascular accident 
(reported by 2 subjects in the placebo group) and myocardial ischemia (reported by 1 subject in the 
mepolizumab 75 mg IV group and 1 subject in the mepolizumab 750 mg IV group). 
When serious CVT events were analysed by CV history or risk, 84% (11/14) of events occurred in 
subjects with a prior CV history or risk. The types of events reported were similar regardless of CV 
history although the numbers are small. The occurrence of a Serious CVT event was spread over time. 
In the OLE Studies, CVT events were reported by 12 subjects (1%) in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC 
group. The only event that was reported by more than one subject was atrial fibrillation. When serious 
CVT events were analysed by CV history or risk, the incidence of events was greater for subjects who 
had a CV history/risk (8 subjects, 2%) compared with those who did not (4 subjects, <1%). Atrial 
fibrillation occurred in both subgroups of subjects. 
Laboratory findings 
No apparent treatment effects on clinical chemistry, liver function tests or haematology values were 
seen in the placebo-controlled or open-label severe asthma studies with the exception of the intended 
therapeutic effect on eosinophil levels. 
•  Electrocardiograms 
An analysis of all ECG data related to QT/QTc interval data from the different studies conducted up to 
2008 concluded that mepolizumab does not adversely affect the QT/QTc interval and the 
cardiovascular AE profile does not suggest an effect on conduction (e.g., torsade de pointes, sudden 
death). From then monitoring of QT/QTc continued during the mepolizumab severe asthma clinical 
programme. 
During the procedure the CHMP requested additional ECG data. The data from the placebo-controlled 
asthma studies (MEA112997, MEA115588, and MEA115575) showed similar numbers of subjects 
across treatment groups experiencing an ‘abnormal’ or ‘abnormal-clinically significant’ result at any 
time post-baseline. In the OLE studies there was a small increase in the number of subjects with an 
‘abnormal-clinically significant’ ECG at any time post-baseline compared to baseline. However, the 
percentage observed in the OLE studies was lower comparable to the percentage of patients in the

placebo group in the placebo-controlled asthma studies with an ‘abnormal-clinically significant’ ECG at 
any time post-baseline.  
Safety in special populations 
•  Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
During the conduct of the mepolizumab clinical development program, female subjects were required 
to commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control (defined as failure 
rate of <1%) from the time of consent, for the duration of the trial, and for 4 months after the last 
dose of study drug administration. 
As of 10 July 2014, 18 pregnancies were reported in female subjects receiving treatment in the 
completed and ongoing mepolizumab studies (all indications).  At that time, the outcomes of 6 
pregnancies were ongoing (all in mepolizumab treated subjects).  Of the 12 known outcomes, 7 
pregnancies resulted in live births (1 in the placebo group, 2 in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group and 
4 in the mepolizumab 750 mg IV group), 3 were spontaneous abortions (1 each in the placebo and 
mepolizumab 75 mg IV and 750 mg IV groups), and 2 were electively terminated (both in 
mepolizumab 750 mg IV group). 
Since 10 July 2014 and at the completion of study MEA115661, 3 of the 6 subjects with ongoing 
pregnancies (referenced in the previous paragraph) had delivered normal live births.  All three subjects 
received mepolizumab 100 mg SC. 
Since there are limited pregnancy data from the mepolizumab asthma clinical trials, ‘Limited data in 
pregnant and lactating females’ was included as missing information in the RMP. A pregnancy 
surveillance study (category 3) was included in the pharmacovigilance plan of the RMP and it is 
planned to evaluate pregnancy outcomes and birth defects. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
The AE data available did not support a return of symptoms or acute exacerbations in greater severity 
than seen at baseline in the follow-up or post follow-up periods after cessation of treatment. 
In a 12-month investigator supported follow-up study [Haldar, 2014], the frequency of severe 
exacerbations increased after discontinuing mepolizumab; however, at 12 months post-treatment, the 
exacerbation frequency was not significantly different compared with subjects previously treated with 
placebo. Although symptoms increased after mepolizumab cessation, they were not considered 
indicative of rebound since there was no association with changes in other clinical measures or 
worsening of eosinophilic airway inflammation. 
Immunological events 
The applicant developed assays for binding antibodies and neutralising antibodies (non-cell-based 
ligand binding assay). The testing strategy and methods adopted for assessment were in agreement 
with the relevant CHMP guidelines (Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of biotechnology-derived 
therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006) and Guideline on immunogenicity assessment 
of monoclonal antibodies intended for in vivo clinical use (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/86289/2010)). 
Based on the currently available data from the severe asthma studies the applicant’s conclusion that 
mepolizumab had low immunogenic potential, and that there was no apparent difference in antibody 
titres or antibody characteristics between drug products MDP1 or MDP2 was agreed by the CHMP. 
In the placebo-controlled Phase III studies using the SC route, the incidence of emergent antibodies 
was 6%. In the totality of the safety database, 63/1160 subjects (5%) developed antibodies. Most 
Assessment report

antibodies had low titres as only a few patients (16) developed antibodies at titres >32. The antibodies 
appeared mostly transient although the sampling frequency is not considered optimal; nevertheless, 
only 13 subjects (1%) had at least 3 positive blood samples spanning over a period of up to 44 weeks. 
Overall, these antibodies did not seem to have an impact on PK, PD and safety, although, this cannot 
be totally ruled out. Only one subject was found to have neutralising antibodies and this was a 
treatment failure with regard to OCS reduction; in addition the treatment was stopped in this subject 
after two injections due to injection site reactions. 
Immunogenicity was included as an ‘Important potential risk’ in the RMP.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The number of subjects experiencing AEs leading to withdrawal in both the placebo-controlled and OLE 
severe asthma studies was low (35 and 19 subjects respectively).In the placebo-controlled studies the 
incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was higher in the placebo group (3%), than the 100 
SC and 75mg IV groups (1% in each group). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 2022 clinical trial subjects have received at least one dose of mepolizumab across a range of 
diseases including asthma, HES, eosinophilic oesophagitis and atopic dermatitis. Overall, 1229 subjects 
with severe eosinophilic asthma have received at least one dose of mepolizumab and 1018 of these 
1229 subjects received mepolizumab 100 mg SC, either as part of a randomised placebo-controlled 
study or in an open-label extension to these studies. Of those treated with mepolizumab 100mg SC, 
138 have been treated up to 12 months and 880 for 12 months to less than 24 months.  
The CHMP considered sufficient the size of the safety database and degree of patient exposure for 
mepolizumab to support this application. There are two on-going open-label extension studies 
(MEA115666 and 201312) that will provide further data on long-term safety. The final report of the 
ongoing extension studies will be submitted when available. This applicant’s commitment was included 
as category 3 studies in the pharmacovigilance plan of the RMP. 
There were limited pregnancy data from the mepolizumab severe asthma clinical trials. Thus, ‘Limited 
data in pregnant and lactating females’ was included as missing information in the RMP. A pregnancy 
surveillance study (category 3) was included in the in the pharmacovigilance plan of the RMP. It is 
planned to evaluate pregnancy outcomes and birth defects. This was endorsed by the CHMP. 
Generally treatment with mepolizumab appeared well-tolerated. Twelve ADRs were identified and 
included in Section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
The overall incidence of subjects reporting the onset of an AE declined as time on treatment increased, 
but the pattern of AEs remained similar. Long-term safety will be assessed through the ongoing OLE 
studies. 
The incidence of SAEs was lower for mepolizumab 100mg SC (6%) and 75mg IV (10%) than for 
placebo (15%). The number of patients that withdrew from the studies due to adverse events was low 
and as with SAEs, the number was lower for mepolizumab 100mg SC (1%) and 75mg IV (1%) than for 
the placebo group (3%). 
On review of adverse events of special interest, there was no apparent increased risk of malignancy, 
infections, malignancies or serious cardiac, vascular, thromboembolic and ischaemic events.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/672504/2015 rev. 1 
Page 90/101 
 
 
 
 
 
During the procedure the CHMP requested further data on type IV hypersensitivity reactions cases and 
its potential association with mepolizumab. No reports of anaphylaxis considered possibly related to 
mepolizumab treatment have been reported. There was one report in the OLE studies of a serious 
delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction that required treatment in ICU. After the assessment of the 
data provided, hypersensitivity reactions (systemic allergic) was added as an ADR in the SmPC in 
addition to the warning in section 4.4 as well as a warning regarding acute and delayed administration 
reactions (including hypersensitivity).  
Local site reactions were reported for more subjects with a subcutaneous route of administration (8%) 
than in the IV (3%) and placebo (3%) groups. This can be expected for the SC route and the levels 
seen and severity of reactions do not raise a concern. 
There were 8 deaths in the severe asthma studies, 2 of which occurred in the placebo group, 5 were 
considered unrelated to mepolizumab and in 1 case the association with mepolizumab could not be 
completely excluded due to the close temporal relationship with the administration of the dose. In this 
final case the subject experienced a severe acute asthma exacerbation approximately 11 hours after 
receiving the second infusion of mepolizumab. 
With the exception of the intended therapeutic effect on eosinophil levels, no apparent treatment 
effects on clinical chemistry, liver function tests, haematology values or ECGs were seen in the 
placebo-controlled or open-label severe asthma studies. 
Based on the currently available data there does not appear to evidence of ‘rebound’ of disease on 
cessation of treatment with mepolizumab. 
The immunogenic potential of mepolizumab appeared to be low.  In the placebo-controlled severe 
asthma studies, 15/263 (6%) of subjects treated with 100 mg SC and 13/652 (2%) of subjects treated 
with IV mepolizumab had anti-mepolizumab antibodies after having received at least one dose. As 
expected, immunogenicity is higher when using the SC route rather than the IV route, but the 
proportion of patients developing anti-mepolizumab antibodies with the recommended dosing was 
considered low. Furthermore, most antibodies had low titres and were transient. The majority of 
antibody positive subjects developed antibodies during the first 4 months of treatment. 
In the severe asthma studies only one patient developed neutralising antibodies. The adverse event 
profiles for antibody positive and negative subjects appeared similar and treatment interruption and 
re-start did not seem to have a significant effect on immunogenicity. Overall, the development of 
antibodies did not appear to impact on the PK and PD profiles of mepolizumab although in rare 
individual cases, some effect on blood drug concentration and eosinophils cannot be ruled out. Data on 
immunogenicity will continue to be collected in the on-going OLE studies. 
On comparison of the data available from the OLE studies for the new drug product (MDP2 – 
introduced in the OLE studies and planned for commercial use), no apparent difference in the adverse 
event or immunogenicity profiles was observed compared to that of the previous drug product (MDP1). 
During the procedure the applicant submitted the final clinical study report for the open-label extension 
study MEA115661. The incidence and type of adverse events seen in this study were similar to those 
seen in the placebo-controlled severe asthma studies. No new safety signals of concern were identified. 
On review of adverse events of special interest, overall the rates of systemic (allergic and non-allergic) 
reactions were lower (2%) than those seen in the placebo-controlled severe asthma studies. For the 13 
subjects that experienced investigator-defined systemic reactions, the binding ADA assay was negative 
in all cases except for one subject. This subject experienced a single injection-related reaction of 
pruritis and no further systemic reactions were reported with later injections.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The CHMP agreed that overall the safety profile of mepolizumab does not currently give rise to any 
major concerns. Treatment with mepolizumab in the severe asthma placebo-controlled studies and the 
open label extension studies was generally well tolerated and exhibited a low immunogenic potential.  
The CHMP considered sufficient the overall size of the safety database for mepolizumab to support the 
indication in adult patients with severe asthma. . One open-label study MEA115661 completed during 
the procedure providing long-term safety data up to 84 weeks of treatment. Two on-going open label 
extension studies (MEA115666 and 201312) are being undertaken that will provide further data on 
long-term safety.  
The applicant will have to submit the final study reports when available. These were included in the 
pharmacovigilance plan of the RMP as category 3 studies.  
2.7.  Risk management plan

Section 4.8 also states that injection site reactions occurred 
more frequently in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (8%) 
compared with placebo (3%). These events were all non-
serious, mild to moderate in intensity and the majority 
resolved within a few days. Local injection site reactions 
occurred mainly at the start of treatment and within the first 3 
injections with fewer reports on subsequent injections. 
Immunogenicity  
SmPC section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties states: 
Immunogenicity 
Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of 
protein and peptide therapeutics, patients may develop 
antibodies to mepolizumab following treatment. In the 
placebo-controlled trials, 15/260 (6%) of subjects treated with 
100 mg dose subcutaneously developed anti-mepolizumab 
antibodies after having received at least one dose of 
mepolizumab. Neutralising antibodies were detected in one 
subject.  Anti-mepolizumab antibodies did not discernibly 
impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
mepolizumab in the majority of patients and there was no 
evidence of a correlation between antibody titres and change 
in blood eosinophil level.

SmPC section 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation states 
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy 
outcomes) from the use of mepolizumab in pregnant women.  
Mepolizumab crosses the placental barrier in monkeys; animal 
studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity with anti-IL5 
treatment.  
The potential for harm to the foetus is unknown. 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
NUCALA during pregnancy. Administration of NUCALA to 
pregnant women should only be considered if the expected 
benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the 
fetus. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no data regarding the excretion of mepolizumab in 
human milk.  However, mepolizumab was excreted into the 
milk of cynomolgous monkeys at concentrations of less than 
0.5% of those detected in plasma. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-
feeding or to discontinue NUCALA therapy taking into account 
the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed 
no adverse effects of anti-IL-5 treatment on fertility. 
Limited data in patients < 
18 years of age 
SmPC section 4.2 Posology and method of administration 
states: 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of NUCALA in children and adolescents 
under 18 years of age has not yet been established.  Very 
limited data are currently available in children 12-18 year old 
(see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2), therefore, no 
recommendations can be made. 
SmPC section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties states: 
The efficacy of mepolizumab in the treatment of a targeted 
group of patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma 
was evaluated in 3 randomised, double-blind, parallel-group 
clinical studies of between 24-52 weeks duration, in patients 
aged 12 years and older. 
There were 25 adolescents, 13 girls and 12 boys, 9 aged 12-14 
years and 16 aged 15-17 years, enrolled in study MEA115588.  
Of the total 25 subjects: 9 received placebo, 9 received 75mg 
IV, and 7 received 100 mg SC.  The same proportion of 
subjects (3/9) receiving placebo and mepolizumab IV reported 
clinically significant exacerbations; but no exacerbations were 
reported in those receiving mepolizumab SC.

2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Nucala (MEPOLIZUMAB) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.Therefore the summary of product 
characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this medicinal product is subject to 
additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety information. The 
statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Two pivotal placebo-controlled exacerbation trials (studies MEA112997 and MEA 115588) were 
conducted in a population of patients with severe refractory asthma not controlled despite high doses 
of inhaled corticosteroids and a second asthma controller; only the criteria used to define the 
eosinophilic phenotype differed. The two trials showed consistent evidence of reduction in the 
frequency of severe exacerbations by about 50%. In a combined analysis (ITT population) of the two 
trials, the rate ratio for clinically significantly exacerbation (mepolizumab/placebo) was 0.51 (95%CI: 
0.42, 0.62; p<0.001) in the pooled 75 mg IV/100 mg SC arm and a similar ratio (0.50; 95%CI: 0.28, 
0.89; p=0.018) was obtained for the exacerbations requiring hospitalisation.  
In the second trial (study MEA 115588), which evaluated the recommended posology of 100 mg SC 
every 4 weeks, a decrease from 1.74 to 0.83 severe exacerbations per year and from 0.10 to 0.03 
hospitalisations per year were observed in active treatment arm of the trial. 
A third pivotal placebo–controlled trial (MEA 115575) investigated mepolizumab’s potential sparing 
corticosteroid sparing effect. In this study, a statistically significant greater relative (%) reduction in 
OCS dose was observed in the mepolizumab arm compared to placebo in the ITT population with an 
odds ratio of 2.39 (95%CI: 1.25, 4.56; p = 0.008), with 64% of the patients treated with 
mepolizumab showing some level of reduction vs. 44% in the placebo arm; 54% of the patients 
treated with mepolizumab achieved a reduction to a dose ≤ 5 mg/day of prednisone vs. 32% in the 
placebo arm (p = 0.025). The median reduction was 5 mg/day regardless of the baseline OCS dose (up 
to 30 mg/d), which was considered clinically meaningful.by the CHMP. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The results of the secondary endpoints were inconsistent across the trials. In the first exacerbation trial 
(Study MEA 112997) no significant difference was observed versus placebo over 12 months with 
respect to lung function, asthma control assessed with the ACQ questionnaire, and quality of life using 
the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. It is known that the relationship between airway 
inflammation, lung function and symptoms is weak [Crimi, 1998; Rosi, 2000; Ronchi 1997]. In 
contrast, in the two other trials (studies MEA 115588 and MEA 115575), some level of improvement in 
lung function (FEV1) was observed; moreover, improvement in asthma control and patient quality of 
life using the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire was clinically relevant and statistically significant 
compared with placebo.

In the corticoid-sparing trial (MEA 115575), the short duration of the evaluation period (4 weeks) was 
not considered sufficient to assess the durability of the response. However, information up to 52 weeks 
was provided as part of the extension study during the procedure showing that the treatment effect 
was sustained. 
There were insufficient data in adolescents, and therefore, the current indication is restricted to adults. 
No formal pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment but 
the CHMP considered this acceptable given that mepolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody. 
This was further addressed in the POPPK analyses and no dose adjustment in these patients was 
included in the SmPC. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Generally treatment with mepolizumab appeared to be well-tolerated and the safety profile based on 
the data submitted did not raise major concerns. 
Headache and nasopharyngitis were the most frequently reported adverse events in the severe asthma 
studies. The incidence of injection site reactions with mepolizumab 100mg SC and placebo was 8% and 
3%, respectively. These adverse events were all non-serious, mild to moderate in intensity and the 
majority resolved within a few days. 
There were 8 deaths in the severe asthma studies. Of the 6 deaths in mepolizumab-treated patients, 4 
were unrelated to treatment and 2 were due to the patients underlying asthma. In one of the asthma 
related deaths, due to the close temporal relationship between the onset of symptoms and 
administration of the infusion a relationship to mepolizumab could not be completely excluded.  
In the three placebo-controlled studies, the number of serious adverse events and of subject 
withdrawals due to adverse events was lower in the 100mg SC/75mg IV mepolizumab treatment 
groups (1% of withdrawals in each group) than in the placebo group (3% withdrawals). 
The overall risk of systemic allergic and non-allergic reactions with mepolizumab appeared to be low. 
No reports of anaphylaxis considered possibly related to mepolizumab treatment were reported. One 
serious type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction with an onset of reaction 3 days after the 9th dose of 
mepolizumab was reported that required treatment in ICU.  
The immunogenic potential of mepolizumab also appeared to be low. In the placebo-controlled severe 
asthma studies, 15/263 (6%) of subjects treated with 100 mg SC and 13/652 (2%) of subjects treated 
with IV mepolizumab developed anti-mepolizumab antibodies after having received at least one dose. 
Most antibodies had low titres and were transient.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Long-term safety of treatment, especially with the SC route, is limited and will be further assessed and 
characterise with the applicant’s post-authorisation submission of results from the two on-going open 
label extension studies (Study MEA 115666 and Study 201312). This was included in the RMP. 
Based on the currently available data, on review of adverse events of special interest, there was no 
apparent increased risk of malignancy, infections, malignancies or serious cardiac, vascular, 
thromboembolic and ischaemic events. The overall risk of systemic allergic and non-allergic reactions 
with mepolizumab and the immunogenic potential of mepolizumab appeared to be low.

During the procedure the final clinical study report for the open-label extension study MEA115661 was 
submitted. The incidence and type of adverse events seen in study MEA115661 were similar to those 
seen in the placebo-controlled severe asthma studies. No new safety signals of concern were identified. 
Currently there was only a limited amount of the safety data for the elderly was limited; 82 subjects 
across all doses in the severe asthma studies were older than 65 years. Thus, it was difficult to draw 
any conclusion on whether the safety profile was similar to that of younger adults. Further data should 
be collected in the post-marketing setting. 
Animal studies did not indicate reproductive toxicity. However, there was limited data from the use of 
mepolizumab in pregnant women to draw any conclusions. A pregnancy surveillance study (category 3) 
was included in the RMP to evaluate pregnancy outcomes and birth defects. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Asthma is a complex disorder characterised by intermittent, reversible airway obstruction and airway 
hyper-responsiveness. Recruitment of eosinophils to the lung, that is believed to be the major cause of 
the smooth muscle hypertrophy and chronic mucosal damage, leads to airway hyper-reactivity and 
deterioration in lung function over time. In vivo, targeting IL-5 with a neutralising monoclonal antibody 
such as mepolizumab, reduces the development and differentiation of eosinophils and leads to a direct 
reduction in the number of blood eosinophils. The rationale for targeting IL-5 with mepolizumab was 
based upon the role of the eosinophil as an important inflammatory cell in the pathogenesis of asthma. 
Exacerbations are the most important outcome in asthma control, because they constitute the greatest 
risk to patients. The reduction in the frequency of severe exacerbations observed in the placebo-
controlled exacerbation trials with mepolizumab (i.e. from approximately two to one per year) was 
considered clinically meaningful by the CHMP. 
There is a recognised medical need in developing steroid sparing strategies due to the large number of 
complications of prolonged corticosteroid administration. The applicant conducted a small trial (MEA 
115575, the results of which did not appear to be compelling; nevertheless, a reduction of 5 mg 
OCS/day regardless of the baseline OCS was obtained and was considered clinically relevant by the 
CHMP. 
Similar effects on blood eosinophil levels and similar efficacy in terms of exacerbations and asthma 
control were observed with an IV formulation and an SC formulation of mepolizumab. The 100 mg SC 
formulation was considered more convenient for patients and healthcare professionals and in time it 
may result in self-administration. The burden of monthly subcutaneous injections was considered to be 
low by the patient. 
There were few treatment discontinuations and both exacerbation studies (MEA112997 and MEA 
115588) had high retention rates in both mepolizumab and placebo arms. 
The overall safety profile of mepolizumab is mainly characterised by non-serious adverse reactions 
(headache, nasopharyngitis, and local reactions). Its immunogenicity and allergic potential is low 
although a risk of type IV hypersensitivity reactions is possible. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considered that since the level of risk associated with mepolizumab use is low, even a 
moderate reduction in severe exacerbations and hospitalisations could outweigh these risks. Likewise,

a reduction of 5 mg/day prednisone in corticosteroid-dependent patient is considered clinically relevant 
and to exceed the risks. Therefore, the overall benefit/risk of mepolizumab is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The impact of mepolizumab on asthma exacerbations tended to increase as pre-treatment blood 
eosinophil levels and frequency of exacerbations increased. In the placebo-controlled trials, the 
patients who benefited the most were those who experienced the highest frequency of exacerbations 
and had the highest levels of blood eosinophils at study entry, which is fully consistent with the 
mechanism of action of mepolizumab.  
Mepolizumab is indicated for adult patients with severe refractory asthma characterised by an 
eosinophilic phenotype. The diagnosis of the phenotype is left to health care professionals specialised 
in the treatment of severe asthma based on sputum or blood eosinophilia while the magnitude of 
mepolizumab effect is described in the SmPC (section 5.1) to further inform their therapeutic decision. 
Although mepolizumab reduces sputum and blood eosinophil counts and asthma exacerbations it has 
little benefit on airways function.  
In corticosteroid dependent patients, a modest improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was observed 
and for some patients a decrease of >50% of OCS was possible, which was shown to be sustainable 
for at least an additional 6 months. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Nucala as an add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic 
asthma in adults is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation 
subject to the following conditions:

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) 
Adempas is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III with 
• 
• 
 to improve exercise capacity (see section 5.1). 
inoperable CTEPH, 
persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment, 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
Adults 
Adempas, as monotherapy or in combination with endothelin receptor antagonists, is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with WHO Functional Class 
(FC) II to III to improve exercise capacity. 
Efficacy has been shown in a PAH population including aetiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH or 
PAH associated with connective tissue disease (see section 5.1). 
Paediatrics 
Adempas is indicated for the treatment of PAH in paediatric patients aged less than 18 years of age 
and body weight ≥ 50 kg with WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III in combination with endothelin 
receptor antagonists (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of 
CTEPH or PAH. 
Posology 
Starting dose 
The recommended starting dose is 1 mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks. Tablets should be taken 3 times 
daily approximately 6 to 8 hours apart (see section 5.2). 
Titration 
Adult patients 
Dose should be increased by 0.5 mg 3 times daily every two weeks to a maximum of 2.5 mg 3 times 
daily, if systolic blood pressure is ≥95 mmHg and the patient has no signs or symptoms of 
hypotension. In some PAH patients, an adequate response on the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) 
may be reached at a dose of 1.5 mg 3 times a day (see section 5.1). If systolic blood pressure falls 
below 95 mmHg, the dose should be maintained provided the patient does not show any signs or 
symptoms of hypotension. If at any time during the up-titration phase systolic blood pressure 
decreases below 95 mmHg and the patient shows signs or symptoms of hypotension the current dose 
should be decreased by 0.5 mg 3 times daily.

Paediatric patients of 6 years of age or older 
Adempas is available for pediatric use as a tablet for those with body weight ≥ 50 kg. 
Titration of riociguat dose is to be performed based on the patient’s systolic blood pressure and 
general tolerability at the discretion of the treating physician/healthcare provider. If systolic blood 
pressure is ≥ 90 mmHg for the 6 to < 12 years age group or ≥ 95 mmHg for the 12 to < 18 years age 
group and the patient has no signs or symptoms of hypotension, the dosage should be increased by 
0.5 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg 3 times daily. 
If systolic blood pressure falls below these specified levels the dosage should be maintained provided 
the patient does not show any signs or symptoms of hypotension. If at any time during the up-titration 
phase systolic blood pressure decreases below the specified levels, or the patient shows signs and 
symptoms of hypotension the current dose should be decreased by 0.5 mg 3 times daily. 
(See below for further information on other indications and other age groups) 
Maintenance dose 
The established individual dose should be maintained unless signs and symptoms of hypotension 
occur. 
The maximum total daily dose is 7.5 mg (i.e., 2.5 mg 3 times daily) for adults and paediatric patients 
with body weight of at least 50 kg. 
If a dose is missed, treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned. 
If not tolerated, dose reduction should be considered at any time. 
Treatment discontinuation 
In case treatment has to be interrupted for 3 days or more, treatment should be restarted with 1 mg 
3 times daily for 2 weeks and continued with the dose titration regimen as described above. 
Transitioning between phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors and riociguat 
Sildenafil must be discontinued in adults and children at least 24 hours prior to administration of 
riociguat. 
Tadalafil must be discontinued at least 48 hours in adults and 72 hours in children prior to 
administration of riociguat. 
Riociguat must be discontinued in adults and children at least 24 hours prior to administration of a 
PDE5 inhibitor. 
It is recommended to monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after any transition (see 
sections 4.3, 4.5 and 5.1). 
Special populations 
Individual dose titration at treatment initiation allows adjustment of the dose to the patient´s needs. 
Elderly 
In elderly patients (65 years or older) there is a higher risk of hypotension and therefore particular care 
should be exercised during individual dose titration (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) have not been studied and therefore use of 
riociguat is contraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3). Patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh B) showed a higher exposure to this medicinal product (see section 5.2). 
Particular care should be exercised during individual dose titration. 
No clinical data are available in children with hepatic impairment. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
Data in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) are limited and there 
are no data for patients on dialysis. Therefore, use of riociguat is not recommended in these patients 
(see section 4.4). 
Patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance <80 - 30 mL/min) showed a 
higher exposure to this medicinal product (see section 5.2). There is a higher risk of hypotension in 
patients with renal impairment, therefore particular care should be exercised during individual dose 
titration. 
No clinical data are available in children with renal impairment. 
Patients on stable doses of strong multi pathway CYP / P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors 
Coadministration of riociguat with strong multi pathway CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors such as azole 
antimycotics (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir) increases 
exposure to riociguat (see section 4.5). When initiating riociguat in patients on stable doses of strong 
multi pathway CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors, consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg 3 times a day to 
mitigate the risk of hypotension. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension on initiation and on 
treatment. Consider a dose reduction for patients on riociguat doses higher than or equal to 1.0 mg if 
the patient develops signs or symptoms of hypotension (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
No clinical data is available in children receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong CYP/P-
gp and BCRP inhibitors. 
- 
- 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of riociguat have not been established in the following pediatric populations: 
- 
Children aged < 6 years (see section 4.1), because of safety concerns. Non clinical data show 
undesirable effects on growing bone (see section 5.3). 
Children with PAH aged 6 to < 12 years with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at treatment 
initiation (see section 4.3) 
Children and adolescents with PAH aged 12 to < 18 years with systolic blood 
pressure <95 mmHg at treatment initiation (see section 4.3) 
Children and adolescents with CTEPH aged < 18 years old (see section 4.1). 
- 
No clinical trial data are available. Therefore, the use of riociguat is not recommended in these 
populations.  
Smokers 
Current smokers should be advised to stop smoking due to a risk of a lower response. Plasma 
concentrations of riociguat in smokers are reduced compared to non-smokers. A dose increase to the 
maximum daily dose of 2.5 mg 3 times daily may be required in patients who are smoking or start 
smoking during treatment (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
A dose decrease may be required in patients who stop smoking. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Food 
Tablets can generally be taken with or without food. For patients prone to hypotension, as a 
precautionary measure, switches between fed and fasted riociguat intake are not recommended 
because of increased peak plasma levels of riociguat in the fasting compared to the fed state (see 
section 5.2). 
Crushed tablets 
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Adempas tablets may be crushed and mixed 
with water or soft foods, such as apple sauce, immediately prior to use and administered orally (see 
section 5.2).

children aged 6 to < 12 years with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, 
patients ≥ 12 years with systolic blood pressure < 95 mmHg. 
• 
• 
Patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (PH-
IIP) (see section 5.1) 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
In pulmonary arterial hypertension, studies with riociguat have been mainly performed in forms 
related to idiopathic or heritable PAH and PAH associated with connective tissue disease. The use of 
riociguat in other forms of PAH not studied is not recommended (see section 5.1). 
In chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of 
choice as it is a potentially curative option. According to standard medical practice, expert assessment 
of operability should be done prior to treatment with riociguat. 
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease 
Pulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary 
veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Therefore, administration of riociguat to such patients is not 
recommended. Should signs of pulmonary oedema occur, the possibility of associated PVOD should 
be considered and treatment with riociguat should be discontinued. 
Respiratory tract bleeding 
In pulmonary hypertension patients there is increased likelihood for respiratory tract bleeding, 
particularly among patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. A careful monitoring of patients taking 
anticoagulants according to common medical practice is recommended. 
The risk of serious and fatal respiratory tract bleeding may be further increased under treatment with 
riociguat, especially in the presence of risk factors, such as recent episodes of serious haemoptysis 
including those managed by bronchial arterial embolisation. Riociguat should be avoided in patients 
with a history of serious haemoptysis or who have previously undergone bronchial arterial 
embolisation. In case of respiratory tract bleeding, the prescriber should regularly assess the benefit-
risk of treatment continuation. 
Serious bleeding occurred in 2.4% (12/490) of patients taking riociguat compared to 0/214 of placebo 
patients. Serious haemoptysis occurred in 1% (5/490) patients taking riociguat compared to 0/214 
patients taking placebo, including one event with fatal outcome. Serious haemorrhagic events also 
included 2 patients with vaginal haemorrhage, 2 with catheter site haemorrhage, and 1 each with 
subdural haematoma, haematemesis, and intra-abdominal haemorrhage. 
Hypotension 
Riociguat has vasodilatory properties which may result in lowering of blood pressure. Before 
prescribing riociguat, physicians should carefully consider whether patients with certain underlying 
conditions, could be adversely affected by vasodilatory effects (e.g. patients on antihypertensive 
therapy or with resting hypotension, hypovolaemia, severe left ventricular outflow obstruction or 
autonomic dysfunction). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Riociguat must not be used in patients with a systolic blood pressure below 95 mmHg (see 
section 4.3). Patients older than 65 years are at increased risk of hypotension. Therefore, caution 
should be exercised when administering riociguat in these patients. 
Renal impairment 
Data in adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) are limited and 
there are no data for patients on dialysis, therefore riociguat is not recommended in these patients. 
Patients with mild and moderate renal impairment were included in the pivotal studies. There is 
increased riociguat exposure in these patients (see section 5.2). There is a higher risk of hypotension in 
these patients, particular care should be exercised during individual dose titration. 
Hepatic impairment 
There is no experience in adult patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C); riociguat is 
contraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3). PK data show that higher riociguat exposure was 
observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B) (see section 5.2). Particular 
care should be exercised during individual dose titration. 
There is no clinical experience with riociguat in patients with elevated liver aminotransferases 
(> 3 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)) or with elevated direct bilirubin (> 2 x ULN) prior to initiation 
of treatment; riociguat is not recommended in these patients. 
Pregnancy/contraception 
Riociguat is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Therefore, female patients at potential 
risk of pregnancy must use an effective method of contraception. Monthly pregnancy tests are 
recommended. 
Smokers 
Plasma concentrations of riociguat in smokers are reduced compared to non-smokers. Dose adjustment 
may be necessary in patients who start or stop smoking during treatment with riociguat (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Concomitant use with other medicinal products 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The concomitant use of riociguat with strong multi pathway CYP and P-gp / BCRP inhibitors 
such as azole antimycotics (e.g. ketoconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole) or HIV protease 
inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir) results in a pronounced increase in riociguat exposure (see sections 4.5 
and 5.2). 
Assess the benefit-risk for each patient individually before prescribing riociguat in patients on 
stable doses of strong multi pathway CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors. To mitigate the risk of 
hypotension, consider dose reduction and monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
In patients on stable doses of riociguat, the initiation of strong multi pathway CYP and 
P-gp/BCRP inhibitors is not recommended as no dosage recommendation can be given due to 
limited data. Alternative treatments should be considered. 
The concomitant use of riociguat with strong CYP1A1 inhibitors, such as the tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor erlotinib, and strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) / breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) 
inhibitors, such as the immuno-suppressive agent cyclosporine A, may increase riociguat 
exposure (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). These medicinal products should be used with caution. 
Blood pressure should be monitored and dose reduction of riociguat be considered.

Adempas contains lactose 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Adempas contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium 
free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The absolute extent of interactions in the 
paediatric population is not known. The interaction data obtained in adults and the warnings in section 
4.4 should be taken into account for the paediatric population. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Nitrates 
In a clinical study the highest dose of riociguat (2.5 mg tablets 3 times daily) potentiated the blood 
pressure lowering effect of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) taken 4 and 8 hours after intake. 
Therefore, co-administration of riociguat with nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in 
any form, including recreational drugs called ‘poppers’, is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
PDE5 inhibitors 
Preclinical studies in animal models showed additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when 
riociguat was combined with either sildenafil or vardenafil. With increased doses, over additive effects 
on systemic blood pressure were observed in some cases. 
In an exploratory interaction study in 7 patients with PAH on stable sildenafil treatment (20 mg 
3 times daily) single doses of riociguat (0.5 mg and 1 mg sequentially) showed additive 
haemodynamic effects. Doses above 1 mg riociguat were not investigated in this study. 
A 12 week combination study in 18 patients with PAH on stable sildenafil treatment (20 mg 3 times 
daily) and riociguat (1.0 mg to 2.5 mg 3 times daily) compared to sildenafil alone was performed. In 
the long-term extension part of this study (non-controlled) the concomitant use of sildenafil and 
riociguat resulted in a high rate of discontinuation, predominately due to hypotension. There was no 
evidence of a favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population studied. 
Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) is 
contraindicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). 
RESPITE was a 24-week, uncontrolled study to investigate switching from PDE5 inhibitors to 
riociguat, in 61 adult PAH patients on stable PDE5 inhibitors. All patients were WHO Functional 
Class III and 82% received background therapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA). For the 
transition from PDE5 inhibitors to riociguat, median treatment-free time for sildenafil was 1 day and 
for tadalafil 3 days. Overall, the safety profile observed in the study was comparable with that 
observed in the pivotal trials, with no serious adverse events reported during the transition period. 
Six patients (10%) experienced at least one clinical worsening event, including 2 deaths unrelated to 
study drug. Changes from baseline suggested beneficial effects in selected patients, e.g. improvement 
in 6MWD (+31 m), N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels 
(-347 pg/mL) and WHO FC I/II/III/IV,% (2/52/46/0), cardiac index (+ 0.3 L/min/m2). 
Soluble Guanylate Cyclase Stimulators 
Concomitant use of riociguat with other soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Warfarin/phenprocoumon 
Concomitant treatment of riociguat and warfarin did not alter prothrombin time induced by the 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anticoagulant. The concomitant use of riociguat with other cumarin-derivatives (e.g. phenprocoumon) 
is also not expected to alter prothrombin time. 
Lack of pharmacokinetic interactions between riociguat and the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin was 
demonstrated in vivo. 
Acetylsalicylic acid 
Riociguat did not potentiate the bleeding time caused by acetyl-salicylic acid or affect the platelet 
aggregation in humans. 
Effects of other substances on riociguat 
Riociguat is cleared mainly via cytochrome P450-mediated (CYP1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2J2) 
oxidative metabolism, direct biliary/faecal excretion of unchanged riociguat and renal excretion of 
unchanged riociguat via glomerular filtration. 
Concomitant use with strong multi pathway CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors 
Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) 
In vitro, abacavir, rilpivirine, efavirenz, ritonavir, cobicistat and elvitegravir inhibited CYP1A1 and 
the metabolism of riociguat in the order listed with abacavir as the strongest inhibitor. Cobicistat, 
ritonavir, atazanavir and darunavir are additionally classified as CYP3A inhibitors. In addition, 
ritonavir showed inhibition of P-gp. 
The impact of  HAART (including different combinations of abacavir, atazanavir, cobicistat, 
darunavir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, elvitegravir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, rilpivirine, ritonavir, and 
tenofovir) on riociguat exposure was investigated in a dedicated study in HIV patients. Concomitant 
administration of HAART combinations led to an increase in riociguat mean AUC of up to about 
160% and to an approximate 30% increase in mean Cmax. The safety profile observed in HIV patients 
taking a single dose of 0.5 mg riociguat together with different combinations of HIV drugs used in 
HAART was generally comparable to other patient populations. 
To mitigate the risk of hypotension when riociguat is initiated in patients on stable doses of strong 
multi pathway CYP (especially CYP1A1 and CYP3A4) and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors, e.g. as contained 
in HAART, consider a reduced starting dose. It is recommended to monitor these patients for signs 
and symptoms of hypotension (see sections 4.2 and  4.4). 
Antifungals 
In vitro, ketoconazole, classified as a strong CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, has been 
shown to be a multi-pathway CYP and P-gp/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor for 
riociguat metabolism and excretion (see section 5.2). Concomitant administration of 400 mg once 
daily ketoconazole led to a 150% (range up to 370%) increase in riociguat mean AUC and a 46% 
increase in mean Cmax. Terminal half-life increased from 7.3 to 9.2 hours and total body clearance 
decreased from 6.1 to 2.4 L/h. 
To mitigate the risk of hypotension when riociguat is initiated in patients on stable doses of strong 
multi pathway CYP (especially CYP1A1 and CYP3A4) and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors, e.g. ketoconazole, 
posaconazole or itraconazole consider a reduced starting dose. It is recommended to monitor these 
patients for signs and symptoms of hypotension (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Concomitant use with other CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors 
Medicinal products strongly inhibiting P-gp/BCRP such as the immuno-suppressive cyclosporine A, 
should be used with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inhibitors for the UDP-Glykosyltransferases (UGT) 1A1 and 1A9 may potentially increase the 
exposure of the riociguat metabolite M1, which is pharmacologically active (pharmacological activity: 
1/10th to 1/3rd of riociguat). For co-administration with these substances follow the recommendation on 
dose titration (see section 4.2). 
From the recombinant CYP isoforms investigated in vitro CYP1A1 catalysed formation of riociguat’s 
main metabolite most effectively. The class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors was identified as potent 
inhibitors of CYP1A1, with erlotinib and gefitinib exhibiting the highest inhibitory potency in vitro. 
Therefore, drug-drug interactions by inhibition of CYP1A1 could result in increased riociguat 
exposure, especially in smokers (see section 5.2). Strong CYP1A1 inhibitors should be used with 
caution (see section 4.4). 
Concomitant use with medicinal products  increasing gastric pH 
Riociguat exhibits a reduced solubility at neutral pH vs. acidic medium. Co-treatment of medicinal 
products increasing the upper gastro intestinal pH may lead to lower oral bioavailability. 
Co-administration of the antacid aluminium hydroxide / magnesium hydroxide reduced riociguat mean 
AUC by 34% and mean Cmax by 56% (see section 4.2). Antacids should be taken at least 2 hours 
before, or 1 hour after riociguat. 
Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inducers 
Bosentan, reported to be a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, led to a decrease of riociguat steady-state 
plasma concentrations in PAH patients by 27% (see sections 4.1 and 5.1). For co-administration with 
bosentan follow the recommendation on dose titration (see section 4.2). 
The concomitant use of riociguat with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbitone or St. John’s Wort) may also lead to decreased riociguat plasma concentration. For co-
administration with strong CYP3A4 inducers follow the recommendation on dose titration (see 
section 4.2). 
Smoking 
In cigarette smokers riociguat exposure is reduced by 50-60% (see section 5.2). Therefore, patients are 
advised to stop smoking (see section 4.2). 
Effects of riociguat on other substances 
Riociguat and its main metabolite are strong inhibitors of CYP1A1 in vitro. Therefore, clinically 
relevant drug-drug interactions with co-treatment which are significantly cleared by 
CYP1A1-mediated biotransformation, such as erlotinib or granisetron cannot be ruled out. 
Riociguat and its main metabolite are not inhibitors or inducers of major CYP isoforms (including 
CYP 3A4) or transporters (e.g. P-gp/BCRP) in vitro at therapeutic plasma concentrations. 
Patients must not get pregnant during riociguat therapy (see section 4.3). Riociguat (2.5 mg 3 times per 
day) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the plasma levels of combined oral contraceptives 
containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol when concomitantly administered to healthy female 
subjects. Based  on this study and as riociguat is not an inducer of any of the relevant metabolic 
enzymes, also no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with other hormonal contraceptives.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception 
Women and female adolescents of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during 
treatment with riociguat. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of riociguat in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity and placental transfer (see section 5.3). Therefore, riociguat is contraindicated 
during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Monthly pregnancy tests are recommended. 
Breast-feeding 
No data on the use of riociguat in breast-feeding women are available. Data from animals indicate that 
riociguat is excreted into milk. Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants 
riociguat should not be used during breast-feeding. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with this medicinal product. 
Fertility 
No specific studies with riociguat in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In a 
reproduction toxicity study in rats, decreased testes weights were seen, but there were no effects on 
fertility (see section 5.3). The relevance of this finding for humans is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Riociguat has moderate influence on the ability to cycle, drive and use machines. Dizziness has been 
reported and may affect the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8). Patients should be 
aware of how they react to this medicinal product, before cycling, driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of riociguat in adults has been evaluated in phase III studies of 650  patients with CTEPH 
and PAH receiving at least one dose of riociguat (see section 5.1). With longer observation in 
uncontrolled long-term extension studies the safety profile was similar to that observed in the placebo 
controlled phase III trials. 
Most of the adverse reactions are caused by relaxation of smooth muscle cells in vasculature or the 
gastrointestinal tract. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 10% of patients under riociguat 
treatment (up to 2.5 mg 3 times daily), were headache, dizziness, dyspepsia, peripheral oedema, 
nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. 
Serious haemoptysis and pulmonary haemorrhage, including cases with fatal outcome have been 
observed in patients with CTEPH or PAH treated with riociguat (see section 4.4). 
The safety profile of Adempas in patients with CTEPH and PAH appeared to be similar, therefore 
adverse reactions identified from placebo controlled 12 and 16 weeks clinical studies are presented as 
pooled frequency in the table listed below (see table 1).

Paediatric patients 
The safety of riociguat has been investigated in 24 paediatric patients aged 6 to less than 18 years over 
24 weeks in a open-label uncontrolled trial (PATENT-CHILD) consisting of an individual dose 
titration phase starting with 1 mg (body weight adjusted) for 8 weeks and a maintenance phase for up 
to 16 weeks (see section 4.2), followed by an optional long-term extension phase. Most common 
adverse reactions including the long-term extension phase were hypotension and headache occurring 
in 4/24, and 2/24 patients, respectively. 
Overall, the safety data is consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
In adults, inadvertent overdosing with total daily doses of 9 to 25 mg riociguat between 2 to 32 days 
was reported. Adverse reactions were similar to those seen at lower doses (see section 4.8). 
In case of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. 
In case of pronounced hypotension, active cardiovascular support may be required. 
Based on the high plasma protein binding riociguat is not expected to be dialysable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihypertensives (antihypertensives for pulmonary arterial 
hypertension) 
ATC code: C02KX05 
Mechanism of action 
Riociguat is a stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an enzyme in the cardiopulmonary 
system and the receptor for nitric oxide (NO). When NO binds to sGC, the enzyme catalyses synthesis 
of the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Intra-cellular cGMP plays an 
important role in regulating processes that influence vascular tone, proliferation, fibrosis, and 
inflammation. 
Pulmonary hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction, impaired synthesis of NO and 
insufficient stimulation of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. 
Riociguat has a dual mode of action. It sensitises sGC to endogenous NO by stabilising the NO-sGC 
binding. Riociguat also directly stimulates sGC independently of NO. 
Riociguat restores the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway and leads to increased generation of cGMP. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Riociguat restores the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway resulting in a significant improvement of pulmonary 
vascular haemodynamics and an increase in exercise ability. 
There is a direct relationship between riociguat plasma concentration and haemodynamic parameters 
such as systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, systolic blood pressure and cardiac output. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Efficacy in adult patients with CTEPH 
A randomised, double-blind, multi-national, placebo controlled, phase III study (CHEST-1) was 
conducted in 261 adult patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension 
(CTEPH) (72%) or persistent or recurrent CTEPH after pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA; 28%). 
During the first 8 weeks riociguat was titrated every 2-weeks based on the patient’s systolic blood 
pressure and signs or symptoms of hypotension to the optimal individual dose (range 0.5 mg to 2.5 mg 
3 times daily) which was then maintained for a further 8 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study 
was the placebo adjusted change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at the last visit 
(week 16). 
At the last visit, the increase in 6MWD in patients treated with riociguat was 46 m (95% confidence 
interval (CI): 25 m to 67 m; p<0.0001), compared to placebo. Results were consistent in the main 
sub-groups evaluated (ITT analysis, see table 2).

Adverse Events leading to discontinuation occurred at a similar frequency in both treatment groups 
(riociguat individual dose titration (IDT) 1.0-2.5 mg, 2.9%; placebo, 2.3%). 
Long-term treatment of CTEPH 
An open-label extension study (CHEST-2) included 237 adult patients who had completed CHEST-1. 
At the end of the study, mean (SD) treatment duration in the total group was 1285 (709) days and 
median duration was 1174 days (ranging from15 to 3512 days). In total, 221 patients (93.2%) had a 
treatment duration of approximately 1 year (at least 48 weeks), 205 patients (86.5%) of approximately 
2 years (at least 96 weeks) and 142 patients (59.9%) of approximately 3 years (at least 144 weeks). 
Treatment exposure was 834 person years in total. 
The safety profile in CHEST-2 was similar to that observed in pivotal trials. After treatment with 
riociguat, the mean 6MWD improved in the overall population by 53 m at 12 months (n=208), 48 m at 
24 months (n=182), and 49 m at 36 months (n=117) compared to baseline. Improvements in 6MWD 
persisted until the end of the study.

Efficacy in adult patients with PAH 
A randomised, double-blind, multi-national, placebo controlled, phase III study (PATENT-1) was 
conducted in 443 adult patients with PAH (riociguat individual dose titration up to 2.5 mg 3 times 
daily: n=254, placebo: n=126, riociguat “capped” dose titration (CT) up to 1.5 mg (exploratory dose 
arm, no statistical testing performed; n=63)). Patients were either treatment-naïve (50%) or pre-treated 
with ERA (43%) or a prostacyclin analogue (inhaled (iloprost), oral (beraprost) or subcutaneous 
(treprostinil); 7%) and had been diagnosed with idiopathic or heritable PAH (63.4%), PAH associated 
with connective tissue disease (25.1%) and congenital heart disease (7.9%). 
During the first 8 weeks riociguat was titrated every 2-weeks based on the patient’s systolic blood 
pressure and signs or symptoms of hypotension to the optimal individual dose (range 0.5 mg to 2.5 mg 
3 times daily), which was then maintained for a further 4 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study 
was placebo-adjusted change from baseline in 6MWD at the last visit (week 12). 
At the last visit the increase in 6MWD with riociguat individual dose titration (IDT) was 36 m 
(95% CI: 20 m to 52 m; p0.0001) compared to placebo. Treatment-naïve patients (n=189) improved 
by 38 m, and pre-treated patients (n=191) by 36 m (ITT analysis, see table 5). Further exploratory 
subgroup analysis revealed a treatment effect of 26 m, (95% CI: 5 m to 46 m) in patients pre-treated 
with ERAs (n=167) and a treatment effect of 101 m (95% CI: 27 m to 176 m) in patients pre-treated 
with prostacyclin analogues (n=27).

Patients treated with riociguat showed significant improvement in Borg CR 10 dyspnoea score (mean 
change from baseline (SD): riociguat -0.4 (2), placebo 0.1 (2); p = 0.0022). 
Adverse Events leading to discontinuation occurred less frequently in both riociguat treatment groups 
than in the placebo group (riociguat IDT 1.0-2.5 mg, 3.1%; riociguat CT 1.6%; placebo, 7.1%). 
Long-term treatment of PAH 
An open label extension study (PATENT-2) included 396 adult patients who had completed 
PATENT-1. 
In PATENT-2, mean (SD) treatment duration in the total group (not including exposure in 
PATENT-1) was 1375 (772) days and median duration was 1331 days (ranging from 1 to 3565 days). 
In total, treatment exposure was approximately 1 year (at least 48 weeks) for 90%, 2 years (at least 
96 weeks) for 85%, and 3 years (at least 144 weeks) for 70% of patients. Treatment exposure was 
1491 person years in total.

Efficacy in paediatric patients with PAH 
PATENT-CHILD 
The safety and tolerability of riociguat 3 times daily for 24 weeks was evaluated in an open-label 
uncontrolled study in 24 paediatric patients with PAH aged 6 to less than 18 years (median 9.5 years). 
Only patients who were receiving stable doses of ERA (n=15, 62.5%) or ERA + prostacyclin 
analogue (PCA) (n=9, 37.5%) were enrolled, and they continued their PAH treatment during the study. 
The main exploratory efficacy endpoint of the study was exercise capacity (6MWD). 
The aetiologies of PAH were idiopathic (n=18, 75.0%), persistent congenital PAH despite shunt 
closure (n=4, 16.7%), heritable (n=1, 4.2%), and pulmonary hypertension associated with 
developmental abnormalities (n=1, 4.2%). Two distinct age groups were included (≥ 6 to < 12 years 
[n=6] and > 12 to < 18 years [n=18]). 
At baseline, the majority of patients were WHO functional class II (n=18, 75%) one patient (4.2%) 
was WHO functional class I and five patients (20.8%) were WHO functional class III. The mean 
6MWD at baseline was 442.12 m. 
The 24-week treatment period was completed by 21 patients while 3 patients withdrew from the study 
due to adverse events. 
For patients with assessments at baseline and at week 24: 
•  mean change in 6MWD from baseline +23.01 m (SD 68.8) (n=19) 
•  WHO functional class remained stable compared to baseline (n=21). 
•  median change in NT-proBNP was -12.05 pg/mL, n=14 
Two patients were hospitalized for right heart failure 
Long-term data were generated from 21 patients who completed the first 24 weeks of treatment in 
PATENT-CHILD. All patients continued to receive riociguat in combination with either ERA or ERA 
+ PCAs. The mean overall duration of exposure to riociguat treatment was 109.79 ± 80.38 weeks (up 
to 311.9 weeks), with 37.5% (n=9) of patients treated for at least 104 weeks and 8.3% (n=2) for at 
least 208 weeks. 
During the long-term extension (LTE) phase improvements or stabilization in 6MWD were 
maintained for patients on treatment with observed mean changes from baseline (before start of 
treatment [PATENT-CHILD]) of +5.86 m at month 6, -3.43 m at month 12; +28.98 m at month 18 and 
-11.80 m at month 24. 
19 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
A majority of patients remained stable regarding WHO functional class II between baseline and 
month 24. Clinical worsening was observed in 8 (33.3%) subjects in total including the main phase. 
Hospitalization for right heart failure was reported in 5 (20.8%) subjects. No deaths occurred during 
the observation period. 
Patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (PH-IIP) 
A randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled phase II study (RISE-IIP) to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of riociguat in adult patients with symptomatic pulmonary hypertension associated with 
idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (PH-IIP) was terminated early due to an increased risk of mortality 
and serious adverse events in patients treated with riociguat and a lack of efficacy. More patients 
taking riociguat died (11% vs. 4%) and had serious adverse events (37% vs. 23%) during the main 
phase. In the long-term extension, more patients who switched from the placebo group to riociguat 
(21%) died than those who continued in the riociguat group (3%). 
Riociguat is therefore contraindicated in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with 
idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (see section 4.3). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Adults 
The absolute bioavailability of riociguat is high (94%). Riociguat is rapidly absorbed with maximum 
concentrations (Cmax) appearing 1-1.5 hours after tablet intake. Intake with food reduced riociguat 
AUC slightly, Cmax was reduced by 35%. 
Bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) is comparable for riociguat administered orally as a crushed tablet 
suspended in apple sauce or in water compared to a whole tablet (see section 4.2). 
Paediatric population 
Children received riociguat tablet with or without food intake. Population PK modeling has shown that 
riociguat is readily absorbed  in children as in adults, after oral administration. 
Distribution 
Adults 
Plasma protein binding in adults is high at approximately 95%, with serum albumin and alpha 1-acidic 
glycoprotein being the main binding components. The volume of distribution is moderate with volume 
of distribution at steady state being approximately 30 L. 
Paediatric population 
No data on riociguat plasma protein binding specific to children is available. Vss estimated via 
population PK modeling in children (age range 6 to <18 years) following oral administration of 
riociguat is 26 L on average. 
Biotransformation 
Adults 
N-demethylation, catalysed by CYP1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP2J2 is the major 
biotransformation pathway of riociguat leading to its major circulating active metabolite M-1 
(pharmacological activity: 1/10th to 1/3rd of riociguat) which is further metabolised to the 
pharmacologically inactive N-glucuronide. 
CYP1A1 catalyses the formation of riociguat’s main metabolite in liver and lungs and is known to be 
inducible by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which, for example, are present in cigarette smoke. 
Paediatric population 
No metabolism data specific to children is available. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Adults 
Total riociguat (parent compound and metabolites) is excreted via both renal (33-45%) and 
biliary/faecal routes (48-59%). Approximately 4-19% of the administered dose was excreted as 
unchanged riociguat via the kidneys. Approximately 9-44% of the administered dose was found as 
unchanged riociguat in faeces. 
Based on in vitro data riociguat and its main metabolite are substrates of the transporter proteins P-gp 
(P-glycoprotein) and BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein). With a systemic clearance of about 
3-6 L/h, riociguat can be classified as a low-clearance drug. Elimination half-life is about 7 hours in 
healthy subjects and about 12 hours in patients. 
Paediatric population 
No mass balance study and metabolism data specific to children are available. Clearence estimated via 
population PK modeling in children (age range 06 to < 18 years) following oral administration of 
riociguat is on average of 2.48 L/h. The geometric mean values for half-lives (t1/2) estimated via 
population PK modeling was 8.24 h. 
Linearity 
Riociguat pharmacokinetics are linear from 0.5 to 2.5 mg. Inter-individual variability (CV) of 
riociguat exposure (AUC) across all doses is approximately 60%. 
The PK profile is similar in children as in adults. 
Special populations  
Gender 
Pharmacokinetic data reveal no relevant differences due to gender in the exposure to riociguat. 
Elderly population 
Elderly patients (65 years or older) exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with 
mean AUC values being approximately 40% higher in elderly, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total 
and renal clearance. 
Inter-ethnic differences 
In adults pharmacokinetic data reveal no relevant inter-ethnic differences. 
Different weight categories 
In adults pharmacokinetic data reveal no relevant differences due to weight in the exposure to 
riociguat. 
Hepatic impairment 
In cirrhotic adult patients (non-smokers) with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) 
riociguat mean AUC was increased by 35% compared to healthy controls, which is within normal 
intra-individual variability. In cirrhotic patients (non-smokers) with moderate hepatic impairment 
(classified as Child Pugh B), riociguat mean AUC was increased by 51% compared to healthy 
controls. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh C). 
No clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment. 
Patients with ALT > 3 x ULN and bilirubin > 2 x ULN were not studied (see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
Overall, mean dose- and weight- normalised exposure values for riociguat were higher in subjects with 
renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. Corresponding values for the main 
metabolite were higher in subjects with renal impairment compared to healthy subjects. In non-
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
smoking individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 80-50 mL/min), moderate (creatinine clearance 
< 50-30 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, riociguat plasma 
concentrations (AUC) were increased by 53%, 139% or 54%, respectively. 
Data in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min are limited and there are no data for patients on 
dialysis. 
Due to the high plasma protein binding riociguat is not expected to be dialysable. 
No clinical data is available in children with renal impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data revealed no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. 
Effects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
activity of riociguat (haemodynamic and smooth muscle relaxing effects). 
In growing, juvenile and adolescent rats, effects on bone formation were seen. In juvenile rats, the 
changes consisted of thickening of trabecular bone and of hyperostosis and remodeling of metaphyseal 
and diaphyseal bone, whereas in adolescent rats an overall increase of bone mass was observed at 
doses 10 times the unbound AUC in the pediatric population. The clinical relevance of this finding is 
not known. No such effects were observed in juvenile rats at doses ≤ 2 times the unbound AUC in the 
pediatric population, or in adult rats. No new target organs were identified. 
In a fertility study in rats, decreased testes weights occurred at systemic exposure of about 7-fold of 
human exposure, whereas no effects on male and female fertility were seen. Moderate passage across 
the placental barrier was observed. Developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits have shown 
reproductive toxicity of riociguat. In rats, an increased rate of cardiac malformation was observed as 
well as a reduced gestation rate due to early resorption at maternal systemic exposure of about 8-fold 
of human exposure (2.5 mg 3 times daily). In rabbits, starting at systemic exposure of about 4-fold of 
human exposure (2.5 mg 3 times daily) abortion and foetal toxicity were seen.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Adempas is and what it is used for 
Adempas contains the active substance riociguat, a guanylate cyclase (sGC)-stimulator. It works by 
widening the blood vessels that lead from the heart to the lungs. 
Adempas is used to treat adults and children with certain forms of pulmonary hypertension, a 
condition in which these blood vessels become narrowed, making it harder for the heart to pump blood 
through them and leading to high blood pressure in the vessels. Because the heart must work harder 
than normal, people with pulmonary hypertension feel tired, dizzy and short of breath.  
By widening the narrowed arteries, Adempas improves the ability to carry out physical activity, i.e. to 
walk further. 
Adempas is used in either of two types of pulmonary hypertension: 
- 
- 
Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). 
Adempas tablets are used to treat CTEPH in adult patients. In CTEPH, the blood vessels of the 
lung are blocked or narrowed with blood clots. Adempas can be used for patients with CTEPH 
who cannot be operated on, or after surgery for patients in whom increased blood pressure in the 
lungs remains or returns. 
Certain types of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  
Adempas tablets are used to treat PAH in adults and children under 18 years with body weight 
of at least 50 kg. In PAH, the wall of the blood vessels of the lungs are thickened and the 
vessels become narrowed. Adempas is only prescribed for certain forms of PAH, i.e. idiopathic 
PAH (the cause of PAH is unknown), heritable PAH and PAH caused by connective tissue 
34 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disease. Your doctor will check this. Adempas can be taken alone or together with certain other 
medicines used to treat PAH. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Adempas 
Do not take Adempas if you: 
- 
 take PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil). These are medicines to treat high 
blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (PAH) or erectile dysfunction. 
have severe liver problems (severe hepatic impairment). 
are allergic to riociguat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
are pregnant. 
take nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form, medicines often used to 
treat high blood pressure, chest pain or heart disease. This also includes recreational drugs 
called poppers. 
take other medicines, similar to Adempas (soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, such as 
vericiguat). Ask your doctor if you are not sure. 
have low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure: in children aged 6 to < 12 years below 
90 mmHg, in patients ≥ 12 years below 95 mmHg) before starting first treatment with this 
medicine. 
have increased blood pressure in your lungs associated with scarring of the lungs, of unknown 
cause (idiopathic pulmonary pneumonia). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
If any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor first and do not take Adempas. 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Adempas if you 
- 
have recently had serious bleeding from the lung. 
- 
have undergone treatment to stop coughing up blood (bronchial arterial embolisation). 
- 
take blood-thinning medicines (anticoagulants) since this may cause bleeding from the lungs. 
Your doctor will regularly test your blood and measure blood pressure. 
feel short of breath, this can be caused by a build-up of fluid in the lungs. Talk to your doctor 
if this happens. 
have any symptoms of low blood pressure (hypotension) such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or 
fainting or if you are taking medicines to lower your blood pressure or medicines that cause an 
increase in urination or if you have problems with your heart or circulation. Your doctor may 
decide to monitor your blood pressure. If you are older than 65 years, you have an increased 
risk of developing low blood pressure. 
take medicines used to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole) 
or medicines for the treatment of HIV infection (e.g. abacavir, atazanavir, cobicistat, 
darunavir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, elvitegravir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, rilpivirine, ritonavir, 
and tenofovir). Your doctor will monitor your health status and should consider a lower starting 
dose for Adempas. 
are on dialysis or if your kidneys do not work properly (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) 
the use of this medicine is not recommended. 
have moderate liver problems (hepatic impairment). 
start or stop smoking during treatment with this medicine, because this may influence the level 
of riociguat in your blood. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Children and adolescents 
The use of Adempas tablets in children under 6 years and adolescents below 50 kg of weight should be 
avoided. Efficacy and safety have not been established in the following pediatric populations: 
- 
- 
Children aged < 6 years because of safety concerns. 
Children with PAH with too low blood pressure: 
aged 6 to < 12 years < 90 mmHg at treatment initiation. 
aged 12 to < 18 years <95 mmHg at treatment initiation. 
o 
o 
Children and adolescents with other forms of this disease, i.e. CTEPH, if aged < 18 years old. 
- 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Adempas 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, in particular, medicines used for: 
- 
high blood pressure or heart disease (such as nitrates and amyl nitrite in any form or other 
soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (such as vericiguat)). You must not take those medicines 
together with Adempas.) 
high blood pressure in the lung vessels (the pulmonary arteries), as you must not take certain 
medicines (sildenafil and tadalafil) together with Adempas. Other medicines for high blood 
pressure in the lung vessels, such as bosentan and iloprost, can be used with Adempas, but you 
should still tell your doctor.

3. 
How to take Adempas 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
Adempas tablets are available for patients aged 6 years and over and weighing at least 50 kg. 
Treatment should only be started and monitored by a doctor experienced in the treatment of high blood 
pressure in lung arteries. During the first weeks of treatment your doctor will need to measure your 
blood pressure at regular intervals. Adempas is available in different strengths and by checking your 
blood pressure regularly at the beginning of your treatment, your doctor will ensure that you are taking 
the appropriate dose. 
Crushed tablets: 
If you have difficulty swallowing the whole tablet, talk to your doctor about other ways to take 
Adempas. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or a soft food, such as apple sauce, 
immediately before you take it. 
Dose 
The recommended starting dose is a 1 mg tablet taken 3 times a day for 2 weeks.  
The tablets should be taken 3 times a day, every 6 to 8 hours. They can generally be taken with or 
without food.  
However, if you are prone to having low blood pressure (hypotension), you should not switch from 
taking Adempas with food to taking Adempas without food because it may affect how you react to this 
medicine.  
During the first weeks of treatment your doctor will need to measure your blood pressure at least every 
two weeks. Your doctor will increase the dose every 2 weeks to a maximum of 2.5 mg 3 times a day 
(maximum daily dose of 7.5 mg) unless you experience very low blood pressure. In this case, your 
doctor will prescribe you Adempas at the highest dose you are comfortable on. The best dose will be 
selected by your doctor. For some patients lower doses 3 times a day might be sufficient. 
Special considerations for patients with kidney or liver problems 
Tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver problems. Your doctor may adjust the dose. If you have 
severe liver problems, do not take Adempas. 
65 years or older 
If you are 65 years or older your doctor will take extra care in adjusting your dose of Adempas, 
because you may be at greater risk of low blood pressure. 
Special considerations for patients who smoke 
Tell your doctor if you start or stop smoking during treatment with this medicine. Your doctor may 
adjust the dose.

If you take more Adempas than you should 
Please contact the doctor if you took more Adempas than you should and if you notice any side effects 
(see section 4). If your blood pressure drops (which can make you feel dizzy) then you may need 
immediate medical attention. 
If you forget to take Adempas 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you miss a dose, continue with the next 
dose as planned. 
If you stop taking Adempas 
Do not stop taking this medicine without talking to your doctor first, because this medicine prevents 
the progression of the disease. If you stop to take this medicine for 3 days or longer, please tell your 
doctor before restarting taking this medicine. 
If you are transitioning between sildenafil or tadalafil and Adempas 
You must have a pause between the intake of the previous and the new medicines to avoid interaction: 
Switching to Adempas 
−  Take or give Adempas not earlier than 24 hours after you stop sildenafil. 
−  Take or give Adempas not earlier than 48 hours after you stop tadalafil for adults and after 
72 hours for children. 
Switching from Adempas 
−  Stop taking or giving Adempas a minimum of 24 hours before you start using a PDE5 inhibitor 
(e.g. sildenafil or tadalafil). 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

1. 
Introduction 
Tracleer contains bosentan, a non-peptide antagonist of human endothelin-1 receptors (ETa and ETb). 
Tracleer  62.5  mg  and  125  mg  film-coated  tablets  were  granted  a  marketing  authorisation  in  the 
European Union on 15 May 2002, through a centralised procedure.  
The currently approved indication for Tracleer 62.5 mg and 125 mg film coated tablets is: 
 “Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to improve exercise capacity and symptoms in 
patients with grade III functional status. Efficacy has been shown in: 
•  primary PAH 
•  PAH secondary to scleroderma without significant interstitial pulmonary disease. 
•  PAH  associated  with  congenital  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts  and  and  Eisenmenger’s 
physiology 
Some improvements have also been shown in patients with PAH WHO functional class II (see section 
5.1.). 
Tracleer  is  also  indicated  to  reduce  the  number  of  new  digital  ulcers  in  patients  with  systemic 
sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease (see section 5.1.).” 
This  submission  seeks  for  a  line  extension  with  a  new  strength  and  pharmaceutical  form  :  Tracleer 
32 mg dispersible tablets to make bosentan available in a more flexible dosing regimen according to 
low body weight especially for children suffering from Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).  
In the treatment of PAH and in the treatment of systemic sclerosis, the current Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC) of Tracleer 62.5 mg film coated tablets and Tracleer 125 mg film coated tablets 
state that Tracleer should be initiated at a dose of 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then increased 
to  the  maintenance  dose  of  125 mg  twice  daily.  The  dose  can  be  increased  in  some  patients  not 
responding  well  to  125  mg  twice  daily  to  250  mg  twice  daily  to  attempt  to  slightly  improve  their 
exercise capacity.  
No dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients over the age of 65 years, neither in patients with renal 
impairment nor in patients with hepatic impairment (i.e. Child-Pugh class A), but it is contraindicated 
in patients with moderate to severe liver dysfunction.  
In 2002, when the MA was granted for Tracleer 65 mg and 125 mg film coated tablets, since no data 
had  been  initially  provided  to  document  neither  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  nor  the  clinical  use  in 
children  and  patients  with  low  body  weight,  the  SPC  initially  stated  under  the  subheading  “Special 
population – Children” in Section 4.2. : “Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 12 years have 
not been established.” Under the subheading “Patients with low body weight”, the SPC stated “There 
is limited experience in patients with a body weight below 40 kg.”.  
In February 2003, the MAH provided the paediatric pharmacokinetic study BREATHE-3 (study AC-
052-356) including 18 children less than 12 years and less than 40 kg. This study was performed with 
film coated tablets administered in a dosing regimen of approximately 2mg/kg b.i.d. (3 dosings : 125 
mg b.i.d.; 62.5 mg b.i.d.; 31.25 mg b.i.d.) and showed a lower systemic exposure in young children as 
compared to the exposure in adults treated with 125 mg b.i.d. Since it was known that Tracleer was 
already used in children as pulmonary hypertension was an orphan fatal disease, the CHMP concluded 
that mentioning the kinetic findings and results from the BREATHE-3 paediatric study in section 4.2 
was warranted in order to inform on the specificity of the pharmacokinetics in children with special 
attention to the lack of data to establish the optimal dose in this population. Indeed, the scarcity of the 
clinical paediatric study (the sole clinical study BREATHE-3) did not allow to establish the optimal 
dose in children less than 12 years bearing in mind that, in one hand, a lower systemic exposure could 
lead to a suboptimal treatment in children (as compared to adult) and, on the other hand, that safety 
concerns  could  not  be  excluded  when  the  dose  would  be  increased  to  reach  a  higher  effect.

available results from its  open-label extension study AC-052-367 (FUTURE-2, with data cut-off for 
this  submission  of  1  March  2008)  and  a  review  of  post  marketing  safety  data.  The  publications 
available on paediatric use of Tracleer from individual series have also been provided as supporting 
data.     
The  SPC  proposed  in  May 2008  by  the  applicant  for  Tracleer  32  mg  dispersible  tablets  was  mainly 
similar  to  the  one  adopted  for  Tracleer  62.5  mg  and  125  mg  film-coated  tablets  with  some  changes 
regarding the information in children in sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2.  
The MAH also sought for the harmonisation of the two film coated tablets (125 mg and 62.5 mg) and 
the  dispersible  tablets  with  respect  to  the  information  in  children  (EMEA/H/C/401/II/0041,  CHMP 
opinion adopted in parallel in April 2009).

Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Tracleer is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets containing 62.5 mg or 125 mg bosentan 
as the monohydrate. 
The new pharmaceutical form and strength, i.e., Tracleer 32 mg dispersible tablets has been developed 
for children as a more suitable pharmaceutical form for this population. In addition, the new strength 
also allows a more flexible dosing regime.  
The  new  paediatric  formulation  is  a  pale  yellow  to  off-white,  clover-shape  dispersible  tablet, 
quadrisected  on  one  side  and  debossed “32”  on  the other  side  containing 32 mg  of  bosentan  (in  the 
form of bosentan monohydrate). 
Active Substance  
The active substance used in the pharmaceutical form is the same as that used in the manufacture of 
the already approved strengths of Tracleer film coated tablets. There were no changes made to active 
substance and therefore no additional data was submitted. 
Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to propose a new dosage form of bosentan containing 
32 mg of drug substance, adapted for children. A quadrisected dispersible tablet containing 32 mg of 
bosentan was developed to be dispersed in a teaspoon with water. 
The  excipients  used  in  the  formulation  of  the  dispersible  tablets  were  calcium  hydrogen  phosphate 
anhydrous  and  microcrystalline  cellulose  (fillers),  silica  colloidal  anhydrous  (flowability), 
croscarmellose sodium (disintegration), aspartame, acesulfame potassium and tutti frutti flavour (taste 
masking), tartaric acid (acidifying agent) and magnesium stearate (lubricant).

Not applicable 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The  finished  product  is  obtained  through  a  standard  process  for  tablets  manufacture  (dry  blending, 
sieving  followed  by  compression  step).  Appropriate  process  flow  diagram  and  description  of  the 
manufacture including the operating parameters and the equipment used have been presented.  
Adequate in-process controls including mass of the tablets, friability, disintegration times  have been 
selected and monitored during the manufacture. 
Dissolution properties of the dispersible tablets were studied on the three validation batches using a 
dissolution method developed specifically for the dispersible tablets. Profiles are similar, 80 % of 
bosentan is dissolved in 20 min. 
Validation was performed on three production-scale batches and results were found satisfactory.  
All excipients are compendial (PhEur), except the tutti frutti flavour. The specifications for tutti frutti 
flavour  are  based  on  the  supplier’s  data.  None  of  the  excipients  used  is  of  animal  or  human  origin 
therefore  the  risk  of  TSE  could  be  excluded.A  certificate  of  analysis  has  been  provided  for  each 
excipient and results were in line with the specifications. 
•  Product Specification 
The finished product specification includes the following parameters: appearance (visual), average 
mass (weight), identification of bosentan (HPLC), friability (PhEur), uniformity of content (PhEur), 
bosentan content (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), disintegration time (PhEur), fineness of 
dispersion (PhEur), microbial contamination (skip testing, PhEur). 
Specifications were adequately justified and non-compendial methods were validated in accordance 
with the ICH requirements. 
Results were presented for two validation batches and three pilot-scale batches. All results conform to 
the proposed specifications. 
The dispersible tablets are packaged into Alu/Alu blisters composed of a blister pack bottom foil and a 
child  resistant  push  through  foil.  Appropriate  information  about  the  material  used  (bottom  foil  and 
child resistant push through foil) has been described. 
Each  blister  will  contain  14  dispersible  tablets.  The  secondary  packaging  will  be  a  carton  box 
containing 56 dispersible tablets. 
Appropriate identification and controls of the packaging materials have been carried out. 
•  Stability of the Product 
The stability of bosentan dispersible tablets 32 mg was conducted on three pilot-scale batches kept in 
the commercial packaging under ICH conditions: accelerated (6 months at 40 °C/75% RH) and long-
term conditions (24 months at 25 °C/60% RH). 
All  the  parameters  remained  within  the  specifications  during  long-term  and  accelerated  storage 
conditions apart from a slight increase of the friability at 40 °C/75% RH. 
Based on these results, the proposed shelf life of 3 years is considered justified under the precautions 
of storage as defined in the SPC.

Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The new pharmaceutical form and strength, i.e., Tracleer 32 mg dispersible tablets has been developed 
for  children  as  a  suitable  pharmaceutical  form  for  this  population.  The  lower  strength  quadrisected 
dispersible tablet allows a more flexible dosing regime for children.  
A dissolution method has been specifically developed for the dispersible tablets. This new dissolution 
method  has  proven  to  be  discriminatory  for  the  32  mg  dispersible  tablets  (effect  of  granulation  and 
hardness on dissolution rate). Although this new method is not fully suitable for other dosage forms, 
such as film-coated, it can better support the similarity between the 62.5 mg film-coated formulation 
and  the  32  mg  dispersible  formulation.  However,  this  in  vitro  dissolution  method  cannot  fulfil 
requirements for a biowaiver for the dispersible tablet. 
In conclusion, the results of test carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of product 
quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  new  strength  and 
pharmaceutical form should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The clinical part of the application submitted in May 2008 to support the present application focuses 
on the paediatric usage primarily based upon the compilation of paediatric data from the paediatric PK 
study  AC-052-356  (BREATHE-3),  a  new  paediatric  PK  study:  AC-052-365  (FUTURE-1),  currently 
available results from its  open-label extension study AC-052-367 (FUTURE-2, with data cut-off for 
this  submission  of  1  March  2008)  and  a  review  of  post  marketing  safety  data.  The  publications 
available on paediatric use of Tracleer from individual series have also been provided as supporting 
data.     
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Pharmacokinetics 
•  Study AC-052-356 (BREATHE-3) 
BREATHE-3  (Study  AC-052-356)  was  previously  submitted  and  assessed  (EMEA/H/C/401/II/02, 
Commission Decision on 26 June 2003).  
This was a 12-week multicenter, open-label, non-controlled, parallel-group single- and multiple-dose 
study, with stratification for weight and epoprostenol use. 
The  primary  objective  was  to  investigate  the  pharmacokinetics  of  bosentan  given  as  single  and 
multiple  oral  doses  in  pediatric  patients  with  PAH.  The  secondary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  the 
tolerability and safety of single and multiple oral doses of bosentan and to obtain preliminary data on 
changes  in  exercise  capacity,  Borg  dyspnea  index,  hemodynamics,  and  WHO  functional  class  after 
12 weeks of treatment in pediatric patients with PAH.

This study was conducted in 18 children with a body weight less than 40 kg (aged from 3 to 15 years 
(mean:  9.7  years),  with  pulmonary  hypertension,  and  treated  with  a  maintenance  dose  according  to 
their body weight of approximately 2 mg/kg b.i.d. (125 mg b.i.d.; 62.5 mg b.i.d.; 31.25 mg b.i.d.) as 
dispensed  with  Tracleer  film  coated  tablets.  Following  a  screening  period  of  3  to 21 days,  eligible 
patients were assigned to one of three parallel bosentan treatment arms on the basis of body weight as 
summarised in the Table 1 below.

In  summary,  the  results  showed  a  lower  exposure  to  bosentan  in  paediatric  patients  as  compared  to 
adult patients treated with 125 mg b.i.d. (based on a historical control with PK data from study AC-
052-357 performed in adults). 
•  Study AC-052-365 (FUTURE-1) 
This study was an open-label, multicenter, uncontrolled, 12-week study to assess the pharmacokinetics 
(as  primary  objective)  and  tolerability  and  safety  (as  secondary  objective)  of  bosentan  orally 
administered with 32 mg dispersible tablets in children with idiopathic or familial pulmonary arterial 
hypertension.

The study consisted of a screening period of a maximum of 4 weeks, a treatment period of 12 weeks, 
and a post-treatment follow-up period of 28 days. Patients were to receive the bosentan with a 32 mg 
dispersible  tablet  formulation  orally  for  12  weeks,  with  the  dosage  adjusted  to  the  patient’s  body 
weight at study start. After 4 weeks of treatment, the initial dose of 2 mg/kg b.i.d. was to be up-titrated 
to the maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg b.i.d. All patients were to start the study drug at the 2 mg/kg b.i.d. 
dose, whether or not they were previously treated with bosentan. Patients weighing 30 kg or more i.e. 
to  receive  a  maximum  of  120  mg  b.i.d.  of  bosentan,  unless  down-titration  was  necessary,  in  which 
case they were to receive 64 mg b.i.d. 
Patient demographics are summarised in the table below. 
Table 3 – Summary of patient demographics 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that exposure to bosentan in paediatric patients with IPAH 
or familial PAH is similar to that in adults with PAH, using  the new dispersible tablet. The primary 
endpoint  was  defined  as  the  area  under  the  plasma  concentration  time  curve  during  a  dose  interval 
(AUCτ) of bosentan following treatment with the paediatric formulation. 
The  PK  assessment  was  to  be  performed  at  least  2  weeks  after  up-titration  to  the  maintenance  dose 
(i.e., between Weeks 6 and 12). For patients remaining on the initial dose (i.e., no up-titration to the 
maintenance dose at Week 4) or who started with the maintenance dose, the PK assessment was to be 
performed at any time after Week 4. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
Initial evaluation of the PK results from the first 10 patients indicated lower than expected exposure to 
bosentan,  and  the  protocol  was  therefore  amended  to  require  two  PK  assessments  instead  of  one 
(protocol  Amendment  2).  The  new  PK  assessment  (PK1)  was  performed  at  least  2  weeks  after  the 
initiation  of  study  drug  at  2  mg/kg  b.i.d.  (i.e.,  between  Week  2  and  Week  4).  The  second  PK 
assessment  (PK2)  continued  to  be  performed  at  least  2  weeks  after  up-titration  to  the  maintenance 
dose of 4 mg/kg b.i.d. (i.e., between Week 6 and Week 12). Blood samples were taken immediately 
prior to drug administration and then at 0.5h, 1h, 3h, 7.5h, and 12h post-dose 
A total of 36 patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty-five patients were enrolled into the study as 
per  the  original  protocol,  while  11  patients  were  enrolled  following  implementation  of  protocol 
Amendment  2.  Four  patients  were  aged  2–3  years,  9  were  aged  4–5  years  and  23  were  aged  6–11 
years,  and  all  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  bosentan.  summarized  in  Table  6.  One  patient 
(patient  104–132)  was  excluded  from  the  Per-protocol  PK  analysis  set  because  the  patient  received 
incorrect study medication: the evening dose was administered about 1 hour prior to the 12-hour blood 
sample being withdrawn. Pharmacokinetic analysis therefore comprised 35 patients

In the 11 patients who underwent two PK assessments, the exposure to bosentan following both the 
initial dose of 2 mg/kg and the maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg was similar, i.e., there was no increase in 
exposure to bosentan after doubling of the dose.

The primary objective of the study was not met: the geometric mean of the AUCτ following treatment 
with the pediatric formulation of bosentan (and 95% confidence interval) was 4,383 ng.h/ml (3,461; 
5,552). The ratio of the geometric means for AUCτ (and 90% confidence interval) was 0.5 (0.4, 0.8), 
indicating  that  exposure  to  bosentan  in  adults  was  almost  twice  the  exposure  in  children.  The 
confidence  interval  around  the  ratio  of  the  geometric  means  of  AUCτ  was  not  entirely  within  the 
predefined equivalence limits of 0.66–1.5. 
The exposure to bosentan observed in FUTURE-1 was in the range of exposures found in BREATHE-
3. 
Analysis  of  different  covariates  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  bosentan  did  not  show  any  trend  for  an 
effect of gender, WHO class, concomitant epoprostenol, or previous treatment with bosentan.  
•  Discussion on pharmacokinetics 
The results of BREATHE-3 showed a lower exposure to bosentan in paediatric patients as compared 
to adult patients treated with 125 mg b.i.d. (based on a historical control with PK data from study AC-
052-357 performed in adults). 
In the 11 children who underwent PK assessments in Study FUTURE 1 at both doses, the exposure to 
bosentan following both the initial dose of 2 mg/kg and the maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg was similar, 
i.e.  there  was  no  increase  in  exposure  to  bosentan  after  doubling  of  the  dose,  suggesting  that  in 
paediatric patients an exposure plateau is reached at lower doses when compared to adults (study AC-
052-357).  
The  exposure  to  bosentan  observed  in  FUTURE-1  (with  the  dispersible  tablet)  was  in  the  range  of 
exposures found in BREATHE-3 (with the currently approved film-coated tablet) and was almost half 
lower than in adults.

Children 
Study AC-052-365 (FUTURE-1) 
5716 ± 5467 
The “plateau” of systemic concentrations at 2 mg/kg per day was observed in the youngest children of 
the  PK  paediatric  studies  which  have  included  mainly  moderate  PAH  (mainly  class  II  functional 
status)  children  suggesting  very  few  right  heart  failure  and  hepatic  impairment  that  might  interfere 
with systemic exposure. Also, it should be reminded that bosentan has a well known high variability 
and a large overlap of kinetics from these studies was observed with findings in adults. The applicant 
made the assumption that the concentration plateau phenomenon in children could be explained by a 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
limited absorption occurring at a lower ingested dose in children than in adults (may be related to a 
lower available surface for absorption in children as compared to adults), rather than by an increased 
metabolism or bile excretion. While it could be a possible explanation, this remains an assumption not 
fully documented and subsequently not confirmed. The age (or weight) at which the pharmacokinetic 
behaviour of bosentan would differ from adults is not clearly defined.  
No  direct  comparison  of  in  vivo  bioavailability  study  has  been  conducted  between  the  dispersible 
tablets and the already approved and marketed film coated tablets. The applicant justified the lack of 
direct bioequivalence demonstration based on extrapolations from kinetic data collected from a study 
performed in adults with an oral suspension of bosentan (not approved) which was compared to the 
film-coated tablets in Study AC-052-106, that was assessed during the initial marketing authorisation 
application  and  accepted  as  demonstrating  bioequivalence  between  film  coated  tablets  and  the  oral 
suspension.  
The approach of bridges between the different formulations of bosentan as claimed by the applicant is 
not  in  accordance  with  the  current  recommendation.  Indeed,  firstly,  according  to  the  “Note  for 
Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), 
biowaiver  is  applicable  to  dosage  forms  such  as  tablets,  capsules  and  oral  suspensions  if  the  active 
substance shows a high solubility and high permeability that is to say BCS-class I, while bosentan is 
BCS-class II. 
Besides,  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  compositions  of  the  different  bosentan  formulations  film 
coated tablets (approved and marketed), oral suspension (not approved) are completely different. It is 
also  noticed  that  even  though  similar  in-vitro  dissolution  profiles  have  been  provided  for  the  three 
bosentan formulations (currently registered film-coated tablet, oral suspension and dispersible tablet), 
in-vitro dissolution cannot be considered representative of in-vivo behaviour. The in-vitro dissolution 
methods  have  been  shown  discriminatory  towards  manufacturing  parameters  only.  Furthermore,  all 
the  physiologically  relevant  pH  conditions  have  not  been  tested.  In-vitro  dissolution  data  cannot  be 
used for waiving comparison of in vivo bioavailability studies.  
However,  in  both  adults  and  children  bosentan,  displays  non-linear  pharmacokinetics  with  less  than 
proportional increase in exposure with increased dose. This non-linearity seems to start at lower doses 
in  children  and  no  difference  in  AUC  was  observed  after  administration  of  doses  2  and  4  mg/kg 
dispersible  tablet.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  bosentan  are  variable  both  in  children  and  in  adults. 
Pharmacokinetic  data  show  a  large  overlap  in  exposure  in  children  in  studies  FUTURE  1  and 
BREATHE-3  and  in  adults  in  studies  EARLY  and  AC-052-357.  The  BREATHE-3  data  were 
thoroughly  evaluated  regarding  relationship  between  demographic  factors  and  pharmacokinetic 
parameters with no clear trends for an effect of age or body weight on AUC or CL/F. Likewise there is 
no relationship between age and exposure in FUTURE 1. The variability in exposure is large over the 
whole age range.  
Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  a  comparison  of  in  vivo  bioavailability  study  between 
dispersible tablet and film-coated tablet should be conducted in adults as a post-approval commitment. 
Until  these  data  are  available  the  use  of  the  dispersible  tablet  should  be  reserved  for  patients  who 
cannot take the film-coated tablet. 
Clinical efficacy  
The supportive clinical efficacy data provided in this application is based primarily upon the paediatric 
use :  
-  Study AC-052-356 (BREATHE-3), a PK children study with film-coated tablets that has been 
already submitted and assessed in 2002, (EMEA/H/C/401/II/02, Commission Decision on 26 
June 2003). 
-  Study AC-052-365 (FUTURE-1), a PK children study newly submitted, with dispersible 
tablets. 
-  Study AC-052-367 (FUTURE-2), an open-label extension of FUTURE-1 with data cut-off for 
this submission of 1 March 2008. The study is still on going 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  Bibliographic individual studies and experiences from investigators with film-coated tablets.  
•  Study AC-052-356 (BREATHE-3, film coated tablets) 
As discussed above, this was a 12-week multicenter, open-label, non-controlled, parallel-group single- 
and multiple-dose study, with stratification for weight and epoprostenol use. The secondary objectives 
were to evaluate the tolerability and safety of single and multiple oral doses of bosentan and to obtain 
preliminary  data  on  changes  in  exercise  capacity,  Borg  dyspnea  index,  hemodynamics,  and  WHO 
functional class after 12 weeks of treatment in pediatric patients with PAH. 
19 pediatric patients were enrolled:  
- 
- 
- 
6 patients > 40 kg (3 on epoprostenol, 3 not on epoprostenol) 
6 patients 20 < x ≤ 40 kg (3 on epoprostenol, 3 not on epoprostenol) 
7 patients 10 ≤ x ≤ 20 kg (4 on epoprostenol, 3 not on epoprostenol) 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : 
The majority of patients were Caucasian (78.9% overall), and about half were male 9 (47.4%) and 10 
were female (52.6%). The mean age was 9.7 years old (Min ; Max : 3.0 ; 15.0 years). 
6 patients were < 8 years.  
The mean weight was 30.8 kg (Min ; Max : 13.9 kg ; 54.0 kg). 
All 19 patients suffered from either primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) (n = 10) or PAH related to 
congenital  systemic-to-pulmonary  communications  (n  =  9).  Congenital  heart  defects  associated  with 
PAH in patients in this study included atrial septal defect (ASD) (n=4), ventricular septal defect (VSD) 
(n=2),  and  patent  ductus  arteriosus  (n=2).    In  addition,  one  patient  was  reported  to  have  had  ASD, 
VSD, and anomalous pulmonary venous return. 
All  patients  were  in  either  WHO  functional  class  II  (n=10;  78.9%)  or  class  III  (n=  4;  21.1%)  at 
baseline. 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy was assessed only as exploratory analysis.  
Haemodynamic parameters 
Pulmonary  hemodynamics  were  improved  after  12  weeks  of  bosentan  treatment,  with  a  decrease  in 
mean PAP observed in 15 of the 18 patients and an increase in cardiac index observed in 11 of the 17 
patients  with  measurements.  Changes  in  haemodynamic  parameters  are  summarized  in  the  Table  X 
below.

Exercise Parameters 
For  exploratory  purposes,  exercise  parameters  (6-minute  walk  test,  Borg dyspnea  index, progressive 
cycle ergometry test) were evaluated in 12 patients who were at least 8 years of age. 
Changes  in  exercise  test  parameters  at  weeks  12  from  baseline  were  highly  variable  and  none  were 
significant.  Although some patients showed beneficial effects, no firm conclusions could be drawn. 
The mean and median changes from baseline in peak VO2 were 53.0 and −3.5 ml/min, respectively (p 
= 0.4697). 
WHO Functional Class 
WHO functional class was assessed by the investigator based on knowledge of the patient and parental 
input.    During  the  12  weeks  of  treatment,  five  patients  (26.3%)  improved  by  one  functional  class:  
three patients moved from class III to class II, and two improved from class II to class I.  One patient 
deteriorated (class II to III). The other 13 remain in the same WHO functional class (12 remain class 
II, one remain class III). 
Electrocardiography 
No clinically relevant change in mean heart rate or PQ, QRS, QT, or QTc interval was observed. 
•  Study AC-052-365 (FUTURE-1, dispersible tablets)  
In  addition  to  PK  assessment  previously  discussed,  the  following  variables  were  descriptively 
assessed:  
-  Change in concomitant medication records. 
-  Physical examination. 
-  ECG (12-lead). 
-  Vital signs and body weight. 
-  WHO Functional Class. 
-  Quality of life (SF-10) questionnaire completed by the parents or legal representatives. 
-  Global Clinical Impression scale assessed by parents and physician. 
-  Laboratory  tests  including  hematology,  chemistry,  LFTs,  and  serum  pregnancy  test  for 
females of childbearing potential. 
-  AE and SAE records. 
-  Return of study medication. 
No pulmonary hemodynamics measurements were performed.  
One  of  the  study’s  36  patients  was  excluded  from  the  analysis  of  clinical  efficacy  because  of  the 
development of a confounding condition (i.e. an atrial septostomy performed after reconsideration of 
the  pre-existing  severity  of  the  disease  [syncope  present  in  the  medical  history]).  Two  patients  had 
study  treatment  discontinued  prematurely.  One  was  discontinued  because  of  patient  difficulties  with 
the  administration  of  the  oral  dispersible  tablets  formulation,  the  second  one  died  during  the  study 
(suspected infection otitis triggering right ventricular failure).   
At baseline 23 patients were in WHO class II, and 12 were in WHO class III functional status. 
A total of 15 patients had “previous bosentan” intake prior to study treatment start (9 in WHO class II, 
5 in WHO class III) and 21 patients were identified as “bosentan naïve” patients (14 in WHO class II, 
7 in WHO class III).  
The most common treatments reported at baseline by frequency were epoprostenol (9 patients, 25.0%), 
furosemide (8 patients, 22.2%), and oxygen (7 patients, 19.4%). 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy was assessed only as exploratory analysis.

The changes from baseline to week 4, 8, and 12 in the WHO functional class showed the majority of 
patients were stable. At Week 12, out of the 23 patients at baseline who were diagnosed class II, one 
worsened to class III and two improved to class I (the remaining 20 patients were stable at class II), 
and  out  of  the  12  patients  at  baseline  who  were  diagnosed  class  III,  none  worsened,  and  three 
improved  to  class  II.  The  improvements  were  mainly  observed  in  bosentan  naïve  patients  while  in 
contrast patients previously treated with bosentan remained largely stable with one patient worsening 
from class II to class III.  
•  Study AC-052-367 (FUTURE-2, dispersible tablets)  
FUTURE-2  is  an  on  going  extension  of  FUTURE-1.  It  is  multicenter  (11),  prospective,  open-label, 
non-controlled with the primary objective to collect additional safety data and additional exploratory 
efficacy and outcome data in paediatric patients with IPAH or familial PAH. It will also allow patients 
to stay on bosentan until marketing approval of the oral dispersible tablets formulation.  
Patients continuing into FUTURE-2 were to continue receiving the 4 mg/kg b.i.d. maintenance dose 
they were receiving at the end of FUTURE-1 unless this dose was not tolerated. In such cases, patients 
were down titrated to 2 mg/kg b.i.d. Of the 36 patients enrolled in FUTURE-1, 33 patients continued 
to FUTURE-2.  
In summary, exploratory efficacy analysis was presented by the applicant as the cumulative review for 
FUTURE-1 an FUTURE-2 at the cut-off date of 1 March 2008 (change from baseline in FUTURE-1 
to study end or premature study drug discontinuation in FUTURE-1 or FUTURE-2). According to the 
applicant, the change from baseline (FUTURE-1) to Months 6 (n = 29), 12 (n = 26), and 18 (n = 17) 
with  respect  to  WHO  functional  class  in  patients  still  participating  in  the  study  and  with  the 
assessments available showed that most patients remained stable. At Month 6, 14/20 patients in class 
II at baseline remained in class II and 6/20 improved to class I. Six of 9 patients in class III at baseline 
remained in class III and 3/9 improved to either class II or I. At Month 12, 11/17 patients in class II at 
baseline  remained  in  class  II  and  6/17  improved  to  class  I.  Six  of  9  patients  in  class  III  at  baseline 
remained in class III and 3/9 improved to either class II or I. At Month 18, 7/11 patients in class II at 
baseline remained in class II and 4/11 improved to class I. Four of 6 patients in class III at baseline 
remained in class III and 2/6 improved to either class II or I. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimate (95% 
CI) at Month 6 was 94.2% (86.4%, 100%), and 91.2% (81.6%, 100%) at Months 12, 18, and 24. There 
were 3 deaths in the first 9 months of treatment (one in each of the first 3 quarters of treatment), and 
none thereafter. 
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) worsening occurred in 5 (13.9%) patients, followed by right ventricular 
failure and systemic-pulmonary artery shunt (2 patients each). Three patients died, one in FUTURE-1 
(suspected infection otitis triggering right ventricular failure), and 2 in FUTURE-2 (right heart failure 
after Potts’ anastomosis and cardiac failure, respectively). 
•  Bibliographic data (film-coated tablets) 
The  applicant  also  provided  a  detailed  review  of  the  published  experience  from  9  studies.  Clinical 
experience from the literature refers to non controlled, open label investigator’s experience. About 9 
articles referred to children (up to 18 years) that were receiving bosentan in pulmonary hypertension. 
Patients with mild to moderate conditions were in general stabilised. However, they included various 
aetiologies, various concomitant treatments, and different maintenance dose i.e. 2 mg/kg b.i.d. or also 
4 mg/kg that was requested.   
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Only exploratory efficacy analysis is available in children from those two open-label, not controlled 
clinical  studies  primarily  designed  for  pharmacokinetics  assessment  (BREATHE-3,  FUTURE-1). 
Study BREATHE-3 was conducted using the film coated tablets, and FUTURE-1 was conducted using 
the 32 mg dispersible tablets. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  BREATHE-3,  18  children  aged  from  3  to  15  years  (mean:  9.7  years  old  with  6  patients  under  8 
years)  were  included.  Pulmonary  hemodynamic  improvement  as  compared  to  baseline  was  obtained 
after 12 weeks of maintenance doses of bosentan treatment, as dispensed with the film coated tablets, 
at  a  dosing  regimen  adjusted  according  to  body  weight  (approximately  2  mg/kg  b.i.d.  i.e.  3  dosing 
regimen  groups  :  31.5  mg  b.i.d.;  62.5  mg  b.i.d.  ;  125  mg  b.i.d.  ).  Statistically  significant  decreases 
from  baseline  in  pulmonary  vasculature  pressures  (systolic,  diastolic,  mean)  and  pulmonary 
vasculature  resistance  (PVR,  PVRI)  were  observed,  as  were  statistically  significant  increases  in 
cardiac output and Stroke index. Significant decreases in systemic pressures (systolic, diastolic, mean) 
and systemic vasculature resistance (SVR, SVRI) were also seen. Changes in exercise test parameters 
from  baseline  (6-minute  walk  distance,  cycle  ergometry  test  variables),  assessed  in  12  children  at 
weeks  12  were  highly  variable  and  none  were  significant.  Five  patients  among  the  19  included 
(26.3%)  improved  by  one  functional  class  (WHO).  These  results  are  in  favour  of  a  stabilisation  at 
short  term  with  2  mg/kg  b.i.d.  but  the  duration  of  the  study  was  short  and  half  of  the  patients  were 
concomitantly receiving epoprostenol. No reliable conclusion can be drawn to establish whether the 2 
mg/kg b.i.d. of bosentan had indeed provided the optimal effect on efficacy grounds.  
The newly submitted pharmacokinetic study FUTURE-1 (Study AC-052-365) was conducted with a 
maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg b.i.d. (as dispensed with 32 mg dispersible tablets) in 35 children aged 
from  2  to  11  years  (mean  age  =  6.7  ±  2.7  years;  mean  weight:  22.4  ±  8.1  kg)    Nine  patients  were 
receiving  concomitant  epoprostenol.  Exploratory  analysis  of  efficacy  was  performed  on  WHO 
functional  status  measurement,  patients’  and  physicians’  clinical  impression  rate,  and  SF10 
questionnaire.  Neither  any  exercise  capacity  tests  nor  pulmonary  hemodynamic  measurements  were 
performed. After 12 weeks treatment, most patients remained stable from baseline to Weeks 4, 8, and 
12  with  respect  to  WHO  functional  class.  At  Week  12,  out  of  the  23  patients  at  baseline  who  were 
diagnosed with class II PAH, only one worsened to class III and two improved to class I. Out of the 12 
patients who were diagnosed as class III PAH at baseline, none worsened, and three improved to class 
II. Out of the 24 patients whose condition the physician rated as ‘good’ or ‘very good’ at baseline, two 
were considered to be doing ‘worse’ or ‘significantly worse’, with the majority of responses being ‘no 
change’ or ‘better’, at Week 12. Pulmonary clinical worsening occurred in 2 patients leading to study 
treatment discontinuation, one of them died.   
Study FUTURE-2 is an open label extension study of FUTURE-1 still on going until patients reached 
12  years  of  age  or  dispersible  tablets  are  marketed.  Since  the  enrolment  in  study  FUTURE-1, 
pulmonary worsening occurred in 5 patients (with 2 death) leading to discontinuation of the treatment. 
At the cut-off date of 1er March 2008, 17 patients reached 18 months exposure among the 28 children 
who  are  remaining  in  the study.  Based on  the  interim  data  with  cut-off  date of  1st  March  2008,  the 
maintenance  dose  of  4  mg/kg  allows  most  of  the  patients  included  to  remain  stable  with  respect  to 
WHO functional status and this, with an acceptable tolerance.  
No analysis of pulmonary haemodynamics or any exercise tests are planned. Further to the request of 
the  CHMP,  the  applicant  provided  an  assessment  of  the  evolution  on  growth  profile  in  the  children 
treated  in  FUTURE  1-2.  Despite  difficulties  to  draw  conclusions  based  on  such  limited  number  of 
patients; it seems that bosentan does not have any effect on height and weight of the treated paediatric 
patients. The baseline percentile median values for both criteria were low but remained stable through 
the study.  
Additional supportive data based on the review of published experience refer to the currently marketed 
film  coated  tablets  used  in  open-label  (none  used  the  dispersible  tablets).  All  are  referring  to  not 
controlled  heterogeneous  series  of  patients  with  various  aetiology  of  pulmonary  hypertension  and 
various maintenance doses (2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg b.i.d.). They do not allow any comparison neither to 
establish whether bosentan provides the optimal efficacy in children nor to directly compare 2 mg/kg 
b.i.d. versus 4 mg/kg b.i.d. on safety/efficacy grounds in children.

Clinical safety 
In this application, the safety part focused on paediatric data. Safety paediatric data with bosentan are 
available from study BREATHE-3 (AC-052-356) using the film coated tablets, FUTURE-1 (AC-052-
365)  using  dispersible  tablets,  and  the  currently  available  results  from  its  open  label  extension 
FUTURE-2 (with data cut-off for this submission of 1st March 2008) and from the literature and post-
marketing experience that all refer to film coated tablets uses. All the studies are open-label and non-
comparative.  
•  Clinical trials experience 
The number of paediatric patients included in the BREATHE-3 and FUTURE-1/2 clinical studies is 
limited (n = 55), all the more if one only considers the study using the new dispersible formulation (n 
= 36 from FUTURE-1). 
In BREATHE-3, 19 patients were exposed to bosentan film coated tablets for a mean and median of 
23.9 weeks (0.46 years). The mean extent of exposure to bosentan as dispensed with 32 mg dispersible 
tablets (over both FUTURE-1 and FUTURE-2 study periods up to the data cut-off of 1 March 2008) is 
94.2 weeks. 
Most  cases  of  AEs  reported  in  the  3  clinical  studies  were  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity.  The  most 
frequently reported AEs are not unexpected with bosentan (i.e. flushing, headache, abnormal hepatic 
function,  dizziness,  fluid  retention,  abdominal  pain,  vomiting,  nasopharyngitis  or  pulmonary 
hypertension).  Similarly,  most  SAEs  are  not  unexpected  and  have  been  usually  considered  as 
unrelated  to  study  medication.  Nevertheless,  one  case  of  autoimmune  hepatitis  reported  positive 
rechallenge. Although the patient presented complex medical history (including Down’s syndrome and 
prematurity),  bosentan  may  have  unmasked  an  autoimmune  process.  Only  a  limited  number  of 
laboratory abnormalities have been reported during the 3 clinical studies. 
In  these  studies,  the  safety  profile  of  bosentan  does  not  seem  to  be  influenced  by  age,  doses  or 
indications. There is a trend for a higher frequency of AEs in paediatric patients exposed to bosentan 
for more than 12 weeks compared to those exposed less than 12 weeks. 
However, taking into account the low number of children included and the limited time for follow-up, 
no definite conclusions can be drawn from these clinical studies.  
•  Bibliographic data 
A  total  of  10  bibliographic  studies  has  been  presented  in  this  submission:  Penny  2003,  Ivy  2004, 
Gilbert  2005,  Maiya  2005,  Rosenzweig  2005,  Simpson  2006,  Brun  2007,  Fasnacht  2007,  Humbert 
2007  (this  reference  describes  post-marketing  data  on  the  safety profile  of  bosentan  as  requested  by 
the CHMP; results were based upon the findings already reported within the Tracleer PMS system), 
van Loon 2007. 
From these articles 367 paediatric patients were involved. LFTs abnormalities are the most frequently 
reported events in the published articles. However, since most cases are poorly documented, no data 
on  doses,  time  to  onset,  patients’  conditions  or  history,  conditions  of  occurrence  are  available. 
Therefore, these cases remain unassessable. 
•  Post marketing experience 
The  final  report  for  TRAX  PMS  was  assessed  in  April  2005.  It  was  concluded  that  there  were  no 
events detected through the TRAX PMS system that were determined to be safety signals or warrant 
specific  action  beyond  the  current  recommended  provisions.  The  safety profile  of  Tracleer  observed 
through the TRAX PMS is similar to that previously observed.

The  total  number  of  patients  enrolled  in  Tracleer  PMS  was  4,994,  of  which  4,623  (used  as 
denominator  and  for  exposure  calculations)  were  bosentan  naïve  patients.  Of  those,  169  were 
paediatric  (<  12 years):  23  patients  <  2  years  and  146  patients ≥  2 years  and  <  12 years.  The  mean 
duration  of  exposure  was  similar  in  both  groups,  36.2  weeks  in  paediatric  and  34.2  weeks  in  non-
paediatric  populations.  Regarding  specifically  paediatric  population,  no  particular  pattern  for  the 
safety profile arose. 
The  applicant  also  submitted  a  cumulative  safety  review  of  ADRs  and  a  cumulative  review  of 
hepatobiliary  events  at  the  request  of  the  CHMP,  both  reported  in  paediatric  patients.  The  applicant 
estimated  that  more  than  2,000  paediatric  patients  <  18  years  have  been  treated  during  the  post 
marketing  period  worldwide.  A  total  of  497  cases  (related  and  unrelated)  have  been  reported  for 
paediatric patients during the post marketing period of Tracleer. 
The  global  safety  profiles  seem  comparable  for  both  populations  since  the  most  frequent  SOCs 
involved in ADRs reported are similar for adult and paediatric populations. However, for the related 
cases,  there  is  a  slight  trend  for  a  higher  reporting  rate  in  paediatrics  for  cardiac  disorders  (9.6  % 
versus  4.9  %;  mainly  cardiac  failure,  cyanosis  and  right  ventricular  failure)  and  gastrointestinal 
disorders (8.3 % versus 6.7 %; mainly nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea). 
Regarding liver safety, the profile is consistent with the known safety profile of bosentan in the adult 
population. No new concerns have been evidenced from these data. Based on the worldwide exposure 
data and the number of case reports with at least 1 hepatobiliary event, it is estimated that the global 
overall reporting rate for hepatobiliary events (reported as primary or secondary event) in paediatric 
patients  was  4.2  %  (83/2  000)  for  the  review  period.  This  estimated  reporting  rate  in  the  paediatric 
population is slightly lower compared to the global reporting rate of 5.7 % (3 509/62 000) (up to May 
2008) for patients of all ages treated with Tracleer. 
However,  the  applicant  did  not  provide  a  specific  analysis  of  the  post  marketing  safety  profile 
according to the dose administered (especially 2 mg/kg as compared to 4 mg/kg). This information is 
lacking  for  about  30  %  of  cases  (142/466).  For  the  remaining  60  %  of  patients:  most  adolescents 
received maximum daily dose > 62.5 and ≤ 250 mg; most children daily received maximum daily dose 
> 31.5 and ≤ 125 mg and infants received maximum daily dose ≤ 31.25 mg. 
•  Discussion on clinical safety 
Data provided in this submission are in majority from the film coated tablets (only 35 children with 
32 mg dispersible tablets in short term) and do not raise any new safety concerns regarding paediatric 
use of bosentan. However, data in young children are limited and the studies do not allow comparing 
the 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg on safety grounds. Based on these data, firm conclusions cannot be drawn.  
The  safety  profile  of  bosentan  in  the  paediatric  population  needs  to  be  specifically  monitored  and 
adequately addressed in future PSURs in addition to what is planned in the RMP. The PSUR and Liver 
Safety Update Report (LSUR) submission cycle should continue to be submitted every 6 months, until 
otherwise specified by the CHMP.

Pharmacovigilance 
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system (DDPS) 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described in the version 4 of the DDPS 
provided by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.  
Risk Management Plan 
The  MAH  has  submitted  an  updated  risk  management.  Despite  the  fact  that  no  efficacy/safety 
controlled studies were performed in children and that the safety information on paediatric population 
was limited, no additional pharmacovigilance activities were proposed  by the applicant in the initial 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
version submitted in May 2008 to follow the use and the safety of in paediatric patients while the new 
developed  dispersible  tablet  was  presented  as  the  more  flexible  dosing  form  that  will  subsequently 
promote  the  usage  in  children.  In  this  way,  no  evaluation  of  the  need  for  risk  minimisation  was 
discussed by the applicant. 
The  CHMP  requested  that  the  applicant  plan  to  set-up  a  post-marketing  study,  in  addition  to  the 
controlled distribution system, to follow all paediatric patients who will be treated with Tracleer in the 
EU aiming at collecting further long term safety and clinical data with at least the following criteria: 
- 
effect  on  bosentan  on  general  development  of  paediatric  patients  including  weight,  height, 
sexual maturation, puberty); 
-  Clinical worsening, hospitalisation and death due to PAH; 
-  Demographic criteria ; 
- 
-  Serious  adverse  events  and  all  AEs  of  special  interest  (hepatic  disorders  and  related  events, 
Indication, dose treatment, duration ; 
anaemia and related events, worsening PAH). 
As an alternative to address the CHMP’s concerns on long term safety and clinical data in paediatric 
bosentan-treated patients, the applicant proposed to use data collected through four ongoing registries 
on paediatric PAH disease (in the USA, EU, France and Netherlands) supported by the applicant. The 
MAH agreed to provide the protocols of these registries to the CHMP for review. This proposal was 
acceptable to the CHMP.

Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
The 32 mg dispersible tablet allows a more flexible dosing regimen according to low body weight. As 
dispersible pharmaceutical form in water, it may also be a convenient pharmaceutical form in patients 
who may have difficulties in swallowing hard tablets (including adults, adolescent and children).  
No  direct  comparison  of  in  vivo  bioavailability  study  has  been  conducted  between  the  dispersible 
tablets and the already approved and marketed film coated tablets. In accordance with the “Note for 
Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), 
biowaiver  is  applicable  to  dosage  forms  such  as  tablets,  capsules  and  oral  suspensions  if  the  active 
substance shows a high solubility and high permeability that is to say BCS-class I, while bosentan is 
BCS-class II. 
However,  in  both  adults  and  children  bosentan,  displays  non-linear  pharmacokinetics  with  less  than 
proportional increase in exposure with increased dose. This non-linearity seems to start at lower doses 
in  children  and  no  difference  in  AUC  was  observed  after  administration  of  doses  2  and  4  mg/kg 
dispersible  tablet.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  bosentan  are  variable  both  in  children  and  in  adults. 
Pharmacokinetic  data  show  a  large  overlap  in  exposure  in  children  in  studies  FUTURE  1  and 
BREATHE-3  and  in  adults  in  studies  EARLY  and  AC-052-357.  The  BREATHE-3  data  were 
thoroughly  evaluated  regarding  relationship  between  demographic  factors  and  pharmacokinetic 
parameters with no clear trends for an effect of age or body weight on AUC or CL/F. Likewise there is 
no relationship between age and exposure in FUTURE 1. The variability in exposure is large over the 
whole age range.  
Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  a  comparison  of  in  vivo  bioavailability  study  between 
dispersible tablet and film-coated tablet should be conducted in adults as a post-approval commitment. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Until  these  data  are  available  the  use  of  the  dispersible  tablet  should  be  reserved  for  patients  who 
cannot take the film-coated tablet. 
From  an  efficacy  point  of  view,  the  observed  plateau  in  systemic  concentration  would  suggest  that 
increasing the dose of bosentan beyond 2 mg/kg in paediatric patients in a b.i.d. regimen will unlikely 
result  in  any  increased  exposure  to  bosentan  and  subsequent  increased  effect  on  pulmonary 
vasculature.  The  available  short  term  PK  studies  suggests  that  children  were  stabilised  (based  only 
surrogate  not  very  sensitive  markers  WHO  functional  status  and  hemodynamics)  with  2  mg/kg  for 
short term periods (12 weeks maximum in BREATHE-3 including 18 patients) and maintenance dose 
of  4  mg/kg  in  the  available  longer  term  data  (FUTURE-1-2).  But,  these  studies  were  short  terms, 
uncontrolled,  conducted  in  a  limited  number  of  patients,  whom  a  significant  part  of  them  were 
receiving concomitant eposprostenol.  
No  clinical  study  primarily  designed  for  efficacy/safety  assessment  has  been  performed  in  children 
and  especially  comparing  the  two  maintenance  regimen  2  mg/kg  b.i.d.  versus  4  mg/kg  b.i.d.  on 
safety/efficacy grounds. Based on the PK observation, it would appear “logical” that no benefit would 
be obtained with higher than 2 mg/kg b.i.d. in children. Nevertheless, the age limit (or weight) for such 
a  reasoning  remains  unclear  and  whether  the  optimal  clinical  efficacy/safety  ratio  will  actually  be 
gained with 2 mg/kg remains unexplored.    
Data provided in this submission are in majority from the film coated tablets (only 35 children with 
32 mg dispersible tablets in short term) and do not raise any new safety concerns regarding paediatric 
use of bosentan. However, data in young children are limited and the studies do not allow comparing 
the 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg on safety grounds. Based on these data firm conclusions cannot be drawn.  
Therefore, the CHMP considered that further long term safety and clinical data should be collected in 
paediatric patients. The CHMP agreed for these data to be collected through four ongoing paediatric 
PAH disease (in the USA, EU, France and Netherlands) supported by the applicant. 
The  safety  profile  of  bosentan  in  the  paediatric  population  needs  to  be  specifically  monitored  and 
adequately addressed in future PSURs in addition to what is planned in the RMP. The PSUR/LSUR 
submission  cycle  should  continue  to  be  submitted  every  6  months,  until  otherwise  specified  by  the 
CHMP. 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Tracleer  32  mg  dispersible  tablet  was  favourable  and 
therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  of  this  new  strength  and 
pharmaceutical form.

Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Mozobil 
plerixafor 
On 28 March 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Mozobil. The 
marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Genzyme Europe BV. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows:2 
“Adult patients 
Mozobil is indicated in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to enhance 
mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent 
autologous transplantation in adult patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma whose cells 
mobilise poorly (see section 4.2). 
Paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years)  
Mozobil is indicated in combination with G-CSF to enhance mobilisation of 
haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent 
autologous transplantation in children with lymphoma or solid malignant tumours, 
either: 
•  pre-emptively, when circulating stem cell count on the predicted day of collection 
after adequate mobilization with G-CSF (with or without chemotherapy) is expected 
to be insufficient with regards to desired hematopoietic stem cells yield, or 
•  who previously failed to collect sufficient haematopoietic stem cells (see section 
4.2).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 days 
from adoption of the opinion

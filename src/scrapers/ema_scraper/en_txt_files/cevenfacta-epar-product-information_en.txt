CEVENFACTA is indicated in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) for the treatment of 
bleeding episodes and for the prevention of bleeding in those undergoing surgery or invasive 
procedures in the following patient groups:  
• 
in patients with congenital haemophilia with high-responding inhibitors to coagulation factors VIII 
or IX (i.e. ≥5 Bethesda Units (BU)); 
in patients with congenital haemophilia with low titre inhibitors (BU <5), but expected to have a 
high anamnestic response to factor VIII or factor IX administration or expected to be refractory to 
increased dosing of FVIII or FIX. 
• 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia and/or bleeding disorders. 
Posology  
The dose and duration of treatment depend on the location and severity of the bleeding or the type of 
surgery/procedure, the need for urgent haemostasis, the frequency of administration, and the known 
patient responsiveness to FVIIa-containing bypassing agents during prior bleeding events.  
The results of laboratory assessment(s) of coagulation (prothrombin time (PT)/international 
normalised ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), FVII coagulation activity 
(Clotting time) (FVII:C)) do not necessarily correlate with or predict the haemostatic effectiveness of 
this medicinal product. 
The dose, frequency, and duration of CEVENFACTA therapy should be based on the patient’s clinical 
response and haemostasis evaluation. 
Maximum tolerated doses have not been determined for this medicinal product and cumulative daily 
doses greater than 1 025 μg/kg have not been studied. 
Treatment of bleeding episodes 
Treatment with this medicinal product should be initiated as soon as a bleeding event occurs. 
The recommended initial dose should be adjusted based on the criteria provided in Table 1. 
For mild to moderate bleeding episodes, the duration of home therapy should not exceed 24 hours. 
Only after consultation with the haemophilia treatment centre can continued home treatment be 
considered. 
If signs or symptoms of severe bleeding occur in the home setting, immediate medical care should be 
sought by patients. In the meantime, to avoid any treatment delay, an initial dose can be administered 
at home. 
In all situations, if an adequate haemostatic response is not achieved (e.g., within 24 hours of the first 
administration of CEVENFACTA for mild and moderate bleeding episodes), alternative therapies 
should be considered.

• Days 5-6: 75 μg/kg every 2 to 6 hours 
• Days 7-10: 75 μg/kg every 2 to 8 hours 
• Day 11 onwards: 75 μg/kg every 2 to 12 hours 
The dose and dosing intervals may be adjusted by 
the healthcare provider based on the clinical 
assessment and known patient responsiveness to 
FVIIa-containing bypassing agents. 
Following the surgery, CEVENFACTA (75 
μg/kg) is also recommended prior to drain or 
suture removal or physical therapy. 
Close follow-up is important for early detection of potential postoperative bleeding events that may 
require adjustment of the dosing intervals. 
Special population 
The dosing regimen in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not yet 
been established (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy of CEVENFACTA in children <12 years has not been established. Currently available 
data are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. 
In line with the European Medicines Agency recommendations, there is no relevant use of 
CEVENFACTA for the treatment of congenital haemophilia in the paediatric population from birth to 
less than 6 months. 
Method of administration  
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.  
Administer the solution as an intravenous bolus injection over 2 minutes or less. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity to rabbits or rabbit proteins. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Thrombosis 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is limited information about the safety of this medicinal product in patients with a history of 
arterial or venous thromboembolic disease, because such patients were excluded from CEVENFACTA 
clinical studies. Such reactions have been reported in clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance 
with eptacog alfa and aPCC/PCC (activated or non-activated prothrombin complex).  
The following patients may be at an increased risk of thromboembolic events with use of this 
medicinal product:  
•  History of congenital or acquired haemophilia receiving concomitant treatment with aPCC/PCC 
or other haemostatic agents (see section 4.5); 
•  History of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, crush injury, 
septicaemia, or thromboembolism.  
Patients receiving this medicinal product should be monitored for the development of signs and 
symptoms of activation of the coagulation system or thrombosis. When there is laboratory 
confirmation of intravascular coagulation or presence of clinical thrombosis, the dose of this medicinal 
product should be reduced or treatment should be stopped, depending on the patient’s condition. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur with this medicinal product. Symptoms 
may include hives, itching, rash, difficulty breathing, swelling around the mouth and throat, tightness 
of the chest, wheezing, dizziness or fainting, and low blood pressure. In the event of hypersensitivity 
reactions, patients should discontinue treatment and seek immediate medical attention. 
Patients with known IgE-based hypersensitivity to casein may be at a higher risk of hypersensitivity 
reactions. Should signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, treatment should be discontinued. 
Subsequent treatment with this medicinal product should be based on a thorough assessment of the 
risks and benefits.  
Neutralising antibodies 
Neutralising antibodies may occur with the use of this medicinal product. If treatment with this 
medicinal product does not result in adequate haemostasis, then the development of neutralising 
antibodies should be suspected as the possible cause and, as clinically indicated, testing should be 
performed.  
Neutralising antibodies to other Factor VIIa-containing products have been observed in congenital 
Factor VII-deficient patients, an unapproved indication for eptacog beta (activated).  
Elderly 
The safety and efficacy of this medicinal product have not yet been established in elderly patients. No 
data are available. 
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of this medicinal product have not yet been established in patients with renal 
or hepatic impairment. No data are available. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been conducted with this medicinal product. 
Clinical experience with pharmacologic use of other FVIIa-containing products indicates an elevated 
risk of thrombotic events when used simultaneously with activated prothrombin complex concentrates 
(see section 4.4). 
Based on a non-clinical study with eptacog alfa it is also not recommended to combine rFVIIa and 
rFXIII. There are no clinical data available on the interaction between rFVIIa and rFXIII. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of eptacog beta (activated) in pregnant women. 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of this medicinal product during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether eptacog beta (activated) is excreted in human milk. No studies have been 
conducted to assess the impact of eptacog beta (activated) on milk production or its presence in breast 
milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
CEVENFACTA therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit 
of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effect on male fertility. No fertility data are 
available in humans. Thus, the effect of eptacog beta (activated) on male and female fertility is 
unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The active substance eptacog beta (activated) may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and 
use machines. Dizziness may occur following administration of the active substance eptacog beta (see 
section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
A total of 103 patients received at least one dose of eptacog beta (activated). The overall safety 
population used for the integrated analysis (see Table 3) comprised 75 unique patients, in four clinical 
studies, exposed to 3 418 injections in a total of 1 117 treatment episodes. The most frequently 
reported adverse reactions were infusion site discomfort (1.3%), infusion site haematoma (1.3%), post-
procedural haematoma (1.3%), infusion-related reaction (1.3%), body temperature increased (1.3%), 
dizziness (1.3%) and headache (1.3%). Twenty-eight (28) other patients received a single intravenous 
bolus dose of eptacog beta (activated) in a fifth clinical study (Study LFB-FVIIA-009-19): a summary 
of the safety data from study LFB-FVIIA-009-19 is presented hereafter. 
Paediatric population

Of the 75 patients included in the integrated analysis of safety, 34 were adolescents and children: 13 
(17%) were aged <6 years, 15 (20%) were from 6 to less than 12 years and 6 (8%) were < 18 years. 
The frequency, type, and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in 
adults. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In this section, the following categories of frequency have been used: very common (≥1/10), common 
(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000), very rare 
(<1/10  000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

In study LFB-FVIIa-009-19, only one mild episode of headache (in the 75 µg/kg group) was assessed 
as related to eptacog beta (activated) and was resolved by the end of the study. There was no SAE.  
Overall, the safety data from Study 009-19 did not alter the CEVENFACTA safety profile described 
above. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immunogenicity 
In the pooled safety data for the three pivotal PerSept clinical studies, 5 out of 60 patients had a 
positive screening assay for anti-CEVENFACTA antibodies at baseline (prior to exposure to this 
medicinal product) and at follow-up visits. Two patients had transient anti-CEVENFACTA antibodies 
with an additional confirmatory test for anti-CEVENFACTA antibodies; these were confirmed as non-
neutralising antibodies. 
No patient developed anti-rabbit milk protein antibodies during treatment with this medicinal product. 
Still, as with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no experience of overdose in clinical studies. 
The dosing schedule should not be intentionally increased above the recommended doses due to the 
absence of information on the additional risk that may be incurred.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Blood coagulation factors, ATC code: B02BD08 
Mechanism of action 
In normal conditions, FVIIa is the factor initiating coagulation following its interaction with tissue-
factor (TF) at the cell surface.  Once the complex is formed, it activates mainly Factor X to Factor Xa 
and also factor IX to factor IXa. Activation of Factor X to Factor Xa initiates the common pathway of 
the coagulation cascade in which prothrombin is activated to thrombin, and then converts fibrinogen to 
fibrin to form a haemostatic plug, thereby achieving clot formation at the site of haemorrhage 
(haemostasis). This reaction is several-fold amplified in presence of factor VIII and factor IX. 
In haemophilia A or B patients, factor VIII and factor IX molecules are absent or non-functional 
preventing coagulation amplification. This leads to debilitating bleeds that can sometimes be life 
threatening. 
In these patients, FVIIa activates coagulation through the natural “TF-dependent” mechanism. 
However, the therapeutic doses required to reach haemostasis by using FVIIa are much more elevated 
than the normal FVII(a) circulating concentration. The presence of these supra-natural doses of FVIIa 
induces two additional coagulation pathways.  
A second coagulation pathway “TF-independent” leads similarly than the “TF-dependent” mode of 
action to the generation of FXa at the surface of activated platelets, without the need of TF to anchor 
FVIIa at the cell surface and modify its structure. In addition, the use of high-FVIIa doses also 
alleviates the natural and constant inhibition of FVIIa by the FVII zymogen. 
In a third pathway, FVIIa competes with activated protein C (aPC) by binding to the endothelial 
protein C receptor (EPCR). FVIIa thus down modulates the anticoagulation by limiting the cleavage of 
Factor Va, the FXa co-factor, by the aPC.  
The combination of these three pathways allows FVIIa to bypass the need of FVIIIa or FIXa restoring 
haemostasis in their absence or even in the presence of inhibitors. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Laboratory assessments of coagulation do not necessarily correlate with or predict the 
haemostatic effectiveness of this medicinal product.  
In the Phase 1b clinical study, this medicinal product demonstrated a dose and concentration-
dependent pharmacodynamic effect on the coagulation system, including shortening of aPTT and PT, 
and increasing the thrombin generation test with platelets (TGT) and the maximum clot firmness 
(Fibrin-based Thromboelastometry). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of this medicinal product was evaluated in three phase 3 clinical studies in a total of 60 
male patients with congenital haemophilia A or B with inhibitors. The safety of this medicinal product 
was evaluated in these three clinical studies and also in the Phase 1b study (15 patients) and in an 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
additional clinical study with a PK assessment as the primary objective (28 patients), in a total of 103 
unique male patients with congenital haemophilia A or B with inhibitors. 
Efficacy in the treatment of bleedings in adults and adolescents:  
PerSept 1 was a Phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised, crossover study of two initial dose 
regimens. The general objectives of this study were to assess the safety and efficacy of two dose 
regimens of the medicinal product across the full type of severity of bleeding episodes (mild, 
moderate, and severe), and to assess its pharmacokinetics. Per the study protocol patients ≥12 years of 
age (up to and including 75 years of age) with congenital haemophilia A or B with inhibitors to FVIII 
or FIX (positive inhibitor test BU threshold set at 5) were to be included.  
Patients who met all entry criteria were randomised to start the study with either 75 µg/kg or 225 
µg/kg treatment regimen of this medicinal product. 
Twenty-seven adult and adolescent patients ( ≥12 years to less than 65 years of age) were included and 
evaluated for the treatment of 468 bleeding episodes with a median of 12 bleeding episodes per 
patient. 
The results of an analysis of the proportion of successfully treated bleeding episodes with a “good” or 
“excellent” response (using a four-point rating scale), regardless of severity, at 12 hours after initial 
administration of this medicinal product (primary efficacy endpoint), with missing responses treated as 
failures are provided in Table 4.

The efficacy results are considered inconclusive for PerSept 2: the primary efficacy endpoint was not 
met (i.e., the Objective Performance Criterion (OPC) was not exceeded). See section 4.2. 
Efficacy in the prevention of bleedings in surgery and invasive procedures: 
PerSept 3 was a Phase 3, multicentre, open-label, single-arm study that evaluated the safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product in patients from ≥6 months to ≤75 years of age, who had 
haemophilia A or B with inhibitors to FVIII or FIX (positive inhibitor test BU threshold set at 5), and 
who were scheduled for an elective surgical or other invasive procedure. Twelve patients were 
enrolled in the study (6 in the minor surgery group and 6 in the major surgery group).  
For a major surgical/invasive procedure, treatment was administered at an initial bolus dose of 
200 μg/kg in a ≤2-minute intravenous injection immediately before the surgical incision or start of the 
invasive procedure. For a minor elective surgical/invasive procedure, this medicinal product was 
administered at an initial bolus dose of 75 μg/kg in a ≤2-minute intravenous injection immediately 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
before the surgical incision or start of an invasive procedure. For both minor and major procedures, 
administration was repeated no more frequently than every 2 hours at a dose of 75 μg/kg during and 
after the surgical/invasive procedure. The median duration of exposure was 18 days (major 
procedures) and 2.2 days (minor procedures). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of surgical or other invasive procedures with a 
“good” or “excellent” response to treatment 48 (±4) hours after the last administration of this 
medicinal product as assessed by the investigator. This assessment was based on the totality of 
assessments performed on the patient at each time point, also taking into consideration the surgeon’s 
intraoperative haemostatic assessment, the number of (interventions for) bleeding episodes, oozing, 
blood transfusions, and the amount of medicinal product used. The primary analysis was based on 
non-missing assessments. 
Six adults (up to 56 years old) and 6 paediatric patients (1 adolescent (14 years old) and 5 children (2 
to 9 years old)) received this medicinal product for a total of 12 invasive procedures, of which 6 major 
and 6 minor. Four patients who previously participated in PerSept 1 (2 patients) and PerSept 2 
(2 patients) were included in PerSept 3. 
Of the 12 surgical procedures performed, 9 (81.8%) procedures were reported by the investigator as 
successfully treated (“good” or “excellent” response) at 48 hours after the last administration of this 
medicinal product, 2 (18.2%) were treatment failures (“poor” response), and 1 assessment was missing 
due to discontinuation of the study (withdrawal of consent) prior to the assessment at 48 hours. 
The 2 treatment failures (“poor” response) were in the major surgery group. Response of one of them 
was imputed as “poor” due to discontinuation of the study following a TEAE leading to death (post-
procedural haematoma within 2 days after the last dose of this medicinal product with anti-
haemorrhagic rescue treatment within 52 hours after the last dose of this medicinal product): this was a 
patient who experienced 1 day after drug administration post procedural hematoma, then 3 days after 
drug administration serious gastrointestinal haemorrhage and serious blood loss anaemia, leading to 
death on the same day. The gastrointestinal haemorrhage and blood loss anaemia were initially 
reported as unlikely to be related and were subsequently updated to be probably related to the 
medicinal product by the investigator. Finally, following the independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC)’s and Sponsor’s reassessment, the causality assessment was considered as “unrelated”. The 
other treatment failure required rescue treatment at postoperative Day 7 after which time he was 
determined to be a treatment failure. 
The intraoperative haemostatic effect was rated as “excellent” or “good” for all 12 of the minor and 
major surgeries. The mean estimated actual intraoperative blood loss was lower compared to the mean 
maximum predicted blood loss (for a patient without a bleeding disorder undergoing the same 
procedure) for both minor surgeries (2.3 mL for actual intraoperative and 4.2 mL for maximum 
predicted) and major surgeries (270.0 mL and 350.0 mL, respectively). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic evaluation was conducted in clinical study LFB-FVIIA-009-19 in 28 patients 
with haemophilia A, with or without inhibitors to FVIII (mean age 37.2 (median of 15.1 (range 19-70 
years)) who received a single dose of eptacog beta (activated) (either 75 µg/kg or 225 µg/kg). 
This medicinal product displayed a pharmacokinetic profile comparable to other rhFVIIa products 
with an increase in plasma levels shortly after injection followed by a biexponential decay from the 
maximal concentration to return to baseline approximately 8-12 hours post-administration. 
Data were analysed using noncompartmental analysis (NCA). Results of pharmacokinetic analysis 
after a single bolus intravenous administration of either 75 μg/kg or 225 μg/kg of this medicinal 
product in 28 adult patients are presented in Table 6.

Volume of distribution 
Non-compartmental analysis showed approximate dose proportionality between 75 μg/kg and 225 
μg/kg of eptacog beta (activated), with the geometric mean AUC0-inf and Cmax increasing 3.5- and 
3.4-fold, respectively, for the 3.0-fold dose increment. 
It should be noted that higher exposure (AUC and Cmax) was observed for increasing body weight 
(especially relevant for obese subjects) for either of the available doses (75µg/kg and 225µg/kg). It is 
recognised that data in this subgroup is currently limited, but potential dosing recommendations will 
be updated once sufficient data will become available. 
Limited pharmacokinetic data exist in the elderly: 3 elderly patients, from PK study LFB-FVIIA-009-
19, were included in the clinical studies, 1 aged 70 years in the 75 µg/kg single intravenous dose arm, 
and 2 (the oldest aged 67 years) in the 225 µg/kg single intravenous dose arm. 
No pharmacokinetic data in both renally-impaired and hepatically-impaired patients are available. 
No clinical studies with this medicinal product to evaluate mass balance have been performed. Still, 
metabolism is expected to occur via proteolysis in the liver and excretion occurs in urine and faeces 
(amino acids) based on the available literature. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
All findings in the preclinical safety programme were related to the pharmacological effect of rFVIIa.

1.  CEVENFACTA powder vial and pre-filled syringe with solvent should be at room 
temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C) at reconstitution. 
2.  Remove the plastic cap from the vial (Fig A). If the cap is lost or missing, do not use the vial.  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A 
3.  Wipe the rubber stopper on the vial with an alcohol swab. Allow the alcohol to dry. After 
cleaning with the swab, do not touch the rubber stopper with your fingers and don’t allow 
it to touch any other object until you attach the vial adapter, as this can transfer germs 
(Fig B).  
B 
4.  Open the vial adapter package by peeling off the protective paper cover, without touching the 
inside. Do not remove the vial adapter from the package. The spike of the adapter should line 
up with the middle of the grey rubber stopper (Fig C). 
C 
5.  Turn the package over. Firmly press down to fully insert the vial adapter spike through the 
rubber stopper of the vial (Fig D). 
D 
6.  Lightly squeeze the plastic cover and lift up to remove it from the vial adapter. Do not touch 
the exposed spike of the vial adapter (Fig E).  
E 
15 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
7.  Remove the syringe cap from the pre-filled syringe by holding the syringe body with one hand 
and using the other hand to unscrew the syringe cap (turn to the left). Do not touch the 
syringe tip. Do not use the prefilled syringe if the syringe cap is lost or missing (Fig F). 
 F
8.  While holding the edges of the vial adapter screw on the prefilled syringe (turn to the right) a 
few turns until it starts to tighten. Be careful not to overtighten as you will need to remove 
the syringe later (Fig G). 
G 
9.  Hold the plunger rod by the wide top end in one hand and the syringe body using your other 
hand. Insert the plunger rod into the syringe, and then screw a few turns (turn to the right) so 
that the plunger rod is attached to the grey rubber stopper in the syringe (Fig H). 
H 
10.  Very slowly push the plunger rod down to the bottom of the syringe, in order to transfer all of 
the liquid from the syringe into the vial. Do not push too quickly as it can result in excess 
foam and air in the vial (Fig I). 
I 
11.  Swirl the vial gently or roll between hands until all powder is dissolved. Do not shake the vial 
as this creates foam and air (Fig J). 
J 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
12.  Without withdrawing any medicinal product back into the syringe, unscrew the syringe from 
the vial adapter (turn to the left) until it is completely detached. Don’t remove the vial adapter 
from the vial (Fig K). 
K 
13.  Withdraw the liquid medicinal product from the vial(s), using a syringe provided by your 
specialty pharmacy that is large enough to hold your prescribed dose.  
If your dose requires more than one vial, repeat the above steps with additional kits until you have 
reached your required dose.  
Instructions for administration 
The medicinal product must be administered within 4 hours of reconstitution.  
The medicinal product can be administered in 2 minutes or less as an intravenous infusion. 
Instructions for disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local

7.   CEVENFACTA Instructions For Use 
1.  What CEVENFACTA is and what it is used for 
CEVENFACTA contains the active substance eptacog beta (activated), a recombinant human 
coagulation Factor VIIa (rhFVIIa). 
CEVENFACTA is used in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) who were born with 
haemophilia A or B and who have developed inhibitors (antibodies). It is used for:  
- 
-  
the treatment of bleeding episodes,  
the management of bleeding during surgery. 
How CEVENFACTA works 
This medicine works by making the blood clot at the site of bleeding, when the body’s own clotting 
factors are not working. 
2.  What you need to know before you use CEVENFACTA 
Do not use CEVENFACTA 
- 
if you are allergic to eptacog beta (activated), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6), 
if you are allergic to rabbits or rabbit proteins. 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
Before treatment with CEVENFACTA, tell your doctor: 
- 
If you have a history of atherosclerosis (when your arteries are narrowed by disease), coronary 
artery disease (heart disease due to narrowing of the blood vessels supplying the heart), 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cerebrovascular disease (disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain), a crush injury, 
septicaemia (serious blood infection) or blood clots; 
If you have heart disease, heart failure, abnormal heart rhythms;  
If you had prior pulmonary (lungs) clots or heart surgery; 
If you have or have had any other medical condition. 
- 
- 
- 
Patients with known allergy to casein may be at a higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Should 
signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, treatment should be discontinued and you should seek 
immediate medical attention. Symptoms may include hives (itchy swellings under the skin), itching, 
rash, difficulty breathing, swelling around the mouth and throat, tightness of the chest, wheezing, 
dizziness or fainting, and low blood pressure. 
Although the following conditions have not been observed, they may occur with CEVENFACTA: 
-  Blood clots in arteries in the heart (which could lead to a heart attack or angina), in the brain 
(which could lead to a stroke), or in the lungs or deep veins. Symptoms may include swelling and 
pain in the arms, legs or abdomen, chest pain, shortness of breath, loss of feeling or movement, 
and altered consciousness or speech. 
-  Hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions. Symptoms may include hives (itchy swellings under 
the skin), itching, rash, difficulty breathing, swelling around the mouth and throat, tightness of the 
chest, wheezing, dizziness or fainting, and low blood pressure. 
Inhibitors (antibodies) which may cause bleeding problems. 
- 
If any of these conditions apply to you, talk to your doctor before using CEVENFACTA. 
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your CEVENFACTA. So, every time you get a 
new package of CEVENFACTA, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging 
after Lot) and keep this information in a safe place. 
Adolescents  
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older). 
Other medicines and CEVENFACTA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

- 
you are taking or have recently taken another activated Factor VII, or activated or non-activated 
prothrombin complex concentrates, 
you are taking or have recently taken Factor XIII,  
- 
since the combination of these medicines with CEVENFACTA may increase the risk of 
thromboembolic events (formation of blood clots in the veins).  
You should talk to your doctor before using CEVENFACTA with these medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask

3. 
How to use CEVENFACTA 
Treatment with this medicine should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the 
treatment of haemophilia and/or bleeding disorders. 
CEVENFACTA comes as a powder that must be made up (reconstituted) with its solvent and injected 
into a vein (intravenous injection). See instructions for use guide at the end of this leaflet (section 7). 
When to treat yourself 
Injecting medicines requires special training. Do not attempt to self-inject unless you have been taught 
how to by your healthcare provider or haemophilia treatment centre.  
Many people with inhibitors learn to self-inject or inject with the help of a family member: once 
trained, you will need additional injection equipment along with your CEVENFACTA kit so that you 
can successfully treat your bleeding episodes at home. Be sure to collect all necessary injection 
equipment before preparing the medicine for injection. This additional injection equipment will be 
provided by your healthcare professional (e.g., your pharmacist or haemophilia treatment centre). 
CEVENFACTA may be injected at a haemophilia treatment centre, at your healthcare provider’s 
office, or at home. Treating at the first sign of a bleed is important for bleed management.  
Start treatment of a bleed as early as possible, ideally within 2 hours.  
• In cases of a mild or moderate bleed (e.g., joint, superficial muscle, soft tissue, and mucous 
membranes), you should treat yourself as early as possible, ideally at home.  
• In case of a severe bleed (e.g., life or limb [arm or leg] threatening haemorrhage, intracranial [within 
the skull] or gastrointestinal [in the stomach or gut] haemorrhage) you should contact your doctor.  
Usually, severe bleeds are treated at the hospital and a dose of CEVENFACTA can be given on the 
way there.  
Do not treat yourself for longer than 24 hours without consulting your doctor.  
• Each time you use this medicine tell your healthcare provider as soon as possible.  
• If bleeding is not controlled within 24 hours, contact your healthcare provider or emergency services 
immediately. You will usually need hospital care. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, follow the 
Instructions For Use guide at the end of this leaflet (section 7).   
Inject the solution into your vein over 2 minutes or less. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are 
not sure. 
Dose 
Your healthcare provider will tell you how much CEVENFACTA to use, and when to use this 
medicine based on your weight, condition and type of bleed. 
Treatment of bleeding episodes 
Treatment with this medicine should be started as soon as a bleeding event occurs. 
Mild and moderate bleeding 
For mild to moderate bleeding episodes, treatment at home should not last longer than 24 hours. 
Continuing home treatment after 24 hours can only be considered after consultation with the 
haemophilia treatment centre. 
Severe bleeding  
You should seek immediate medical care if signs or symptoms of severe bleeding occur at home.  
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An initial dose can be administered on your way to the haemophilia treatment centre or your 
healthcare provider’s office to avoid any treatment delay. 
Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor has told you. Check 
with your doctor if you are not sure.  
Method of administration 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration and instructions on 
administration, follow the Instructions For Use guide at the end of this leaflet (section 7).   
If you use more CEVENFACTA than you should 
If you use too much CEVENFACTA, get medical advice at once.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE: 
READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START USING 
CEVENFACTA 
CEVENFACTA is supplied as a powder. Before injection it must be made up (reconstituted) with the 
solvent supplied in the syringe. The solvent is water for injections. The reconstituted CEVENFACTA 
must be injected into your vein (intravenous use only).  
This kit provides the equipment needed to reconstitute this medicine. Additional materials are needed 
to inject the medicine after reconstitution. These materials will be provided by your healthcare 
professional (e.g., your pharmacist or haemophilia treatment centre). 
Your doctor or your nurse will show you and/or your caregiver how to make up and inject 
CEVENFACTA. Do not use this kit without proper training by your healthcare provider or 
haemophilia treatment centre. 
Use a clean and germ-free (aseptic) technique when preparing and injecting the medicine. 
Your CEVENFACTA kit contains: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
1 glass vial with powder for solution for injection 
1 sterile vial adapter for reconstitution equipped with a 5 µm filter 
1 prefilled syringe of water for injections 
1 plunger rod and backstop 
*NOTE: Your CEVENFACTA kit will contain only one vial adapter. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You will also need a sterile injection set (tubing and butterfly needle), a sterile plastic syringe, sterile 
alcohol swabs and a sharps container compliant with local applicable regulations and standards. These 
materials are not included in the CEVENFACTA package. These additional materials will be 
provided by your healthcare professional (e.g., your pharmacist or haemophilia treatment centre). 
1)  Collect equipment and prepare vial 
  Take out the number of CEVENFACTA kits you need to fulfill your prescribed dose, a sterile 
injection set (not supplied) and an alcohol swab (not supplied). 
Do not use the kit if the tamper seal has been broken or you suspect the kit is contaminated. Use 
a new kit instead. 
  Check the expiry date on the side of the kit (Fig. A). 
Do not use if the expiry date has passed. 
  Check the name, strength and colour of the package to make sure it contains the correct product (1 
mg package is yellow, 2 mg package is green and 5 mg package is purple). 
  Clean a flat surface before starting the steps for reconstituting CEVENFACTA. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry using a clean towel or air dry (Fig. B). 
  Take out the contents of one kit and one alcohol swab. Place items on the clean surface (Fig. C). 
  Inspect all contents of the kit. Make sure each vial has a matching coloured syringe. 
Do not use the contents if they have been dropped or if they are damaged. Use a new kit instead. 
  If not already at room temperature, bring the vial and the pre-filled syringe to room temperature. 
You can do this by holding them in your hands until they feel as warm as your hands.  
Do not warm the vial and pre-filled syringe in any other way. 
  Remove the plastic cap from the vial (Fig. D). 
If the plastic cap is loose or missing, do not use the vial. 
  Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab (Fig. E) and allow it to air dry for a few seconds to 
ensure that it is as germ free as possible. 
  After cleaning with the swab, do not touch the rubber stopper with your fingers and do not 
allow it to touch any other object until you attach the vial adapter, as this can transfer germs. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2)  Attach vial adapter 
  Peel off the protective paper cover from the vial adapter package (Fig. F). 
If the protective paper cover is not fully sealed or if it is broken, do not use the vial adapter. 
Do not take the vial adapter out of the protective cap with your fingers. If you touch the spike on 
the vial adapter, you may transfer germs from your fingers onto the spike. 
  Place the vial on a clean flat surface and hold with one hand. Use your other hand to hold the 
plastic cover (with the vial adapter inside) directly over the vial and line up the spike of the 
adapter with the middle of the grey rubber stopper. 
  Firmly press the plastic cover down so that the vial adapter spike breaks through the rubber 
stopper (you may hear/see it "snap" into place) (Fig. G). 
  Lightly squeeze the plastic cover and lift it up to remove it from the vial adapter (Fig. H). 
Do not touch the top of the vial adapter once you have removed plastic cover to avoid 
transferring germs from your fingers. 
NOTE: The 5 mg vial adapter may not sit flat against the vial, but it is fully functional. As mentioned 
previously, your CEVENFACTA kit will contain only one vial adapter: the one suitable for the vial 
included in the kit. 
3)  Attach pre-filled syringe and install the plunger rod 
  Remove the syringe cap from the pre-filled syringe by holding the syringe body with one hand and 
using the other hand to unscrew the syringe cap (turn to the left) (Fig. I). 
Do not touch the syringe tip under the syringe cap to avoid transferring germs from your 
fingers. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use the pre-filled syringe if the syringe cap is loose or missing. 
  Hold the edges of the vial adapter and screw on the pre-filled syringe (turn to the right a few 
times) until it starts to tighten (Fig. J). 
Be careful not to overtighten as you will need to remove the syringe later. 
  To attach the plunger rod onto the syringe, hold the wide top end of the plunger rod in one hand 
and the syringe body in your other hand. 
  Insert the plunger rod into the syringe, then screw a few turns (turn to the right) so that the plunger 
rod is attached to the grey rubber stopper in the syringe (Fig. K). 
4)  Mix medicinal product in vial 
  Very slowly push the plunger rod down to the bottom of the syringe, to transfer all of the liquid 
from the syringe into the vial (Fig. L). 
Do not push too quickly as it can result in excess foam and air in the vial. 
  Swirl the vial gently or roll between hands until all powder is dissolved (Fig. M). 
Do not shake the vial as this creates foam and air. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Check the mixed solution (Fig. N). It should be clear to slightly opaque. All powder should be 
dissolved with no particles floating in the liquid. 
Do not use the medicinal product if the liquid has particles or is cloudy after mixing. Start over 
with a new kit. 
5)  Remove empty syringe from vial adapter 
  Without withdrawing any medicinal product back into the syringe, unscrew the syringe from the 
vial adapter (turn to the left) until it is completely detached (Fig. O). 
  Throw out the empty syringe into an approved sharps container (Fig. P). 
Do not remove the vial adapter. 
Do not touch the luer lock top of the vial adapter. If you touch this top, you may transfer germs 
from your fingers. 
6)  Mix additional vial(s) and inject dose 
  If your dose requires more than one vial, repeat the above steps with additional kits until you have 
reached your required dose. 
  Withdraw the liquid medicinal product from the vial(s), using a sterile syringe provided by your 
pharmacy that is large enough to hold your prescribed dose. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  CEVENFACTA must be administered within 4 hours of reconstitution (Fig. Q). 
Do not use if more than 4 hours have passed since reconstitution. 
  CEVENFACTA can be given as an injection into your vein over the course of 2 minutes or less, 
according to the instructions given by your healthcare provider. 
7)  Throw out empty medicinal product vial(s) 
  After reconstitution and injection, safely dispose of the vial with the vial adapter attached, the 
injection syringe, and any other waste materials into an approved sharps container (Fig. R). 
Do not throw out with ordinary household waste. 
Do not take the vial and vial adapter apart before disposal. 
Do not reuse any components of the kit. 
Follow local applicable regulations and standards for proper disposal of the sharps container.  
Storage 
CEVENFACTA is supplied in a kit that should be stored below 30 °C. 
Do not open the kit contents until you are ready to use them. 
Do not freeze or store syringes containing reconstituted CEVENFACTA solution. 
Avoid exposure of the reconstituted CEVENFACTA solution to direct light. 
Important information 
CEVENFACTA is only for injection into a vein (intravenous administration). Do not inject in 
any other way such as below the skin (subcutaneously) or into a muscle (intramuscularly). 
Contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you experience problems.

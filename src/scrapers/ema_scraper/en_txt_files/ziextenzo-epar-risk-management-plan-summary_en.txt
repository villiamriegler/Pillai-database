Summary of the risk management plan Ziextenzo (pegfilgrastim)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Ziextenzo, a biosimilar 
to Neulasta. The RMP details important risks of Ziextenzo, how these risks can be 
minimized, and how more information will be obtained about Ziextenzo’s risks and 
uncertainties (missing information).
Ziextenzo’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet 
give  essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how 
Ziextenzo should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Ziextenzo should be read in the context of all this 
information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-
language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the  European  Public  Assessment  Report 
(EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of Ziextenzo’s RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Ziextenzo is used to increase the number of white blood cells after treatment with 
chemotherapy to help to prevent the risk of infections. It contains pegfilgrastim as 
the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection.
White blood cells are very sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy which can lower 
the number of these cells in the body.
White  blood  cells  are  important  as  they  help  the  body  to  fight  infection.  If  the 
number of white blood cells fall to a low level (so-called neutropenia), there may 
not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and the risk of infection may be 
increased. 
Patients with a low number of white blood cells who develop fever may be at risk 
of infection of the whole body (also called ‘sepsis’). Sepsis is a serious condition 
that requires urgent diagnosis and treatment.  
Further information about the evaluation of Ziextenzo’s benefits can be found in 
Ziextenzo’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ziextenzo. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or 
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Ziextenzo’s together with measures to minimize such risks and 
the proposed studies for learning more about Ziextenzo’s risks are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
•
• The authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  is  analysed  regularly,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  Ziextenzo  is  not  yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Ziextenzo are risks that need special risk management activities 
to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential. 
Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the 
use of Ziextenzo. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use 
of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not 
been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing  and 
needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important identified risk: Capillary leak syndrome
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Capillary leek syndrome is listed in section 4.4 Special 
warnings and precautions and section 4.8 Undesirable 
effects of the Neulasta SmPC and is therefore 
considered as an important identified risk of LA-EP2006.
Risk factors and risk

chemotherapy, middle age

capillary leak syndrome and receive standard 
symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for 
intensive care

None
Important identified risk: Acute respiratory distress syndrome
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Acute respiratory distress syndrome is described under 
‘Pulmonary adverse events’ in section 4.4 Special 
warnings and precautions and is listed in section 4.8 
Undesirable effects of the Neulasta SmPC and are 
therefore considered as an important identified risk of 
LA-EP2006.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimization 
measures
Acute respiratory distress syndrome may occur in 
people of any age. 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome incidence increases 
with advancing age, ranging from 16 cases per 100,000 
person-years in those aged 15-19 years to 306 cases 
per 100,000 person-years in those between the ages of 
75 and 84 years. The age distribution reflects the 
incidence of the underlying causes.

Important  identified  risk:  Sickle  cell  crisis  in  patients  with  sickle  cell 
disease
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Sickle cell crisis in patients with sickle cell disease is 
listed in section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions 
and section 4.8 Undesirable effects of the Neulasta 
SmPC and is therefore considered as an important 
identified risk of LA-EP2006.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Approximately half the individuals with homozygous 
HbS disease experience vaso-occlusive crisis.
Often, no precipitating cause can be identified. 
However, because deoxygenated HbS becomes 
semisolid, the most likely physiologic trigger of vaso-
occlusive crises is hypoxemia. This may be due to acute 
chest syndrome or accompany respiratory 
complications. 
Dehydration can precipitate pain, since acidosis results 
in a shift of the oxygen dissociation curve (Bohr effect), 
causing hemoglobin to de-saturate more readily. Hemo-
concentration also is a common mechanism. 
Another common trigger is changes in body 
temperature—whether an increase due to fever or a 
decrease due to environmental temperature change. 
Lowered body temperature likely leads to crises as the 
result of peripheral vasoconstriction. Patients should 
wear proper clothing and avoid exposure to ensure 
normal core temperature.

Important potential risk: Cytokine release syndrome
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
No events of cytokine release syndrome of cytokine 
storm were reported in clinical studies. No non-study 
reports of cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm 
were consistent with the clinical definition of cytokine 
release syndrome. Cytokine release syndrome is 
included as a potential risk per the recommendation 
from the PRAC (EMA/PRAC/693228/2013, 
EMA/PRAC/720475/2013/Rev. 1), after consideration of 
the available evidence from case reports in 
EudraVigilance and the scientific literature.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimization 
measures
The administration of monoclonal antibodies and other 
drugs elicit infusion reactions, and the risk factors for 
cytokine release syndrome-mediated infusion reactions 
remain unclear. The severity of the infusion reaction 
might be related to the number of circulating 
lymphocytes. During the first infusion of rituximab to 
patients with relapsed B-cell chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia or low- grade B-cell Iymphoma, patients with 
lymphocyte counts >50 x 109/L were significantly more 
likely to have severe symptoms than those having lower 
baseline lymphocyte counts (p=0.0017).
A person's risk for an infusion reaction to a monoclonal 
antibody is influenced by the route and rate of 
administration, drug form, whether the drug is given in 
combination or as a single agent, and concomitant 
medications. Geographic location may elevate the risk 
for an infusion reaction from cetuximab.
Routine risk minimization measures
Cytokine release syndrome is a disorder characterized 
by nausea, headache, hypotension, shortness of breath 
and rash caused by release of cytokines from the cells. 
All single symptoms are addressed under the respective 
symptoms.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for trametinib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
Following the assessment of the most recent dabrafenib (Tafinlar) PSUR (PSUSA/00010084/201608) 
which concluded in March 2017, the PRAC identified photosensitivity reaction as an adverse reaction of 
dabrafenib when used in combination with trametinib and recommended inclusion of this new adverse 
reaction in section 4.8 of the dabrafenib SmPC for the dabrafenib/trametinib combination with a 
frequency ‘common’. This recommendation was endorsed by the CHMP on 23 March 2017. Therefore, 
the PRAC concluded that the SmPC for trametinib (Mekinist) should be updated accordingly to include 
this new adverse reaction for trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in section 4.8 of the SmPC 
with a frequency ‘common’. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing trametinib were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for trametinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing trametinib is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Hereditary factor X deficiency is a rare type of bleeding disorder due to an inherited lack of Human 
Coagulation Factor X. The gene for factor X is located on the long arm of chromosome 13, so unlike 
haemophilias A and B, both genders can be carriers of the genetic mutation and/or develop the 
condition. The prevalence in the general population is approximately 1 in 1 million (Uprichard and 
Perry, 2002; Peyvandi et al, 2002). 
Hereditary factor X deficiency varies in its severity, which is defined according to the endogenous level 
of factor X in the plasma. Severe factor X deficiency refers to an endogenous factor X concentration of 
<1 IU/dL; moderate factor X deficiency refers to an endogenous factor X concentration of 1 to <5 
IU/dL, and mild factor X deficiency refers to factor X activity of 5 to 20 IU/dL. The level of endogenous 
factor X activity in the general population has been reported to be from 65 to 120 IU/dL. The bleeding 
pattern of subjects with severe factor X deficiency may have similarities to those of male patients with 
haemophilias A and B, with joint and muscle bleeds being common. However, patients with factor X 
deficiency also experience significant bleeding from mucous membranes such as nose, lungs and 
gastrointestinal tract. Females of childbearing age may experience menorrhagia, and bleeding from the 
umbilical cord after childbirth is also common (Herrmann et al, 2006). Bleeding can occur 
spontaneously, follow minor trauma, or occur during surgical interventions. Important co-morbidities of 
the patient population are likely to be those related to the complications of the condition such as 
arthropathy. 
Approximately 95 variants of the factor X gene have been described, giving rise to different 
phenotypes. Type I deficiency, in which a mutation in the factor X gene leads to production of 
truncated proteins, reduces factor X coagulant activity (FX:C) and antigen (FX:Ag) levels, and results 
in a more severe clinical manifestation. Type II deficiency, in which the FX:C is reduced but FX:Ag 
levels are near normal, is a qualitative defect of the factor X protein and often results in more mild 
symptoms. However, caution has been raised about categorising patients according to their 
endogenous levels of factor X, as the clinical phenotype does not correlate well with the laboratory 
phenotype. It is generally accepted that a factor X level of 10-20 IU/dL is required for adequate 
haemostasis, and patients with the severe disorder require more aggressive treatment than those who 
have mild disorder, based on the published data of surveys of cohorts of patients and other 
publications.  
Factor X deficiency is currently treated with replacement therapy, specifically fresh-frozen plasma 
(FFP) or, more recently, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC). Both of these treatments have 
disadvantages as they contain additional plasma proteins other than the required coagulation factor, 
factor X, which may lead to adverse events. PCC products have the advantage over FFP as the 
coagulation factors in PCC are concentrated, thus requiring smaller infusion volumes (approximately 50 
mL). 
Three types of PCC products are available: 3-factor complex containing factors II, IX and X; 4-factor 
complex additionally containing factor VII; and, available in some countries, a complex combining 
factor IX and X. These products were traditionally used to treat patients with haemophilia B, but the 
complexes containing factor II have been associated with thromboembolic complications with repeated 
use. Prothrombin (factor II) has a longer half-life (t1/2) than other clotting factors. The repeated use 
may result in progressive elevation of prothrombin levels and move the haemostatic equilibrium

toward thrombin generation, fibrin deposition, and thrombotic sequelae. However, no evidence of 
thrombotic events has been seen in factor X deficient patients who received repeated PCC 
administrations. In addition, FFP and PCC products often contain unknown and variable amounts of 
factor X, making it difficult to provide precise dosages and a predictable response. The efficacy of a 
PCC product can be compromised by these uncertainties, fluctuating levels of factor X and other 
coagulation factors in the patient, inconsistent dosing, and unpredictable dosing frequencies. The dual 
factor concentrate, factor IX/X contains a high concentration of factor X with specified content. Patients 
who receive this product show increased levels of factor IX as well as factor X. Dosing in treatment of 
factor X deficiency is derived from individual case reports, which may vary by product or batch used.  
Coagadex (Factor X) is a human plasma-derived, high-purity factor X concentrate developed to 
specifically replace deficient factor X and restore hemostasis in patients with factor X deficiency when 
given either to treat bleeding episodes or prophylactically to maintain circulating levels of factor X 
sufficient for hemostasis.  
It is intended for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding episodes and for perioperative 
management in patients with hereditary factor X deficiency. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Coagadex contains concentrated human coagulation factor X derived from pooled human plasma for 
fractionation as active substance (ATC code: B02BD13) representing the factor X molecular species of 
the healthy normal population. Factor X belongs to the procoagulant vitamin-K-dependent prothrombin 
complex factors (FII, FVII, FIX and FX) and presents the zymogen of the serine protease for activated 
factor X (FXa), also known as prethrombokinase or by the eponym Stuart factor, Stuart-Prower factor. 
The finished product is presented as a white or off-white freeze-dried plug or powder in two dose sizes 
of 250 IU and 500 IU of Factor X (nominal). Coagadex is supplied with 2.5 mL (250 IU dose) or 5 mL 
(500 IU dose) sterilized Water for Injections (WFI) as solvent for reconstitution of the freeze-dried 
powder. After reconstitution, concentration of the active ingredient is 100 IU FX/mL.  
A CE marked disposable medical device (Mix2Vial) is supplied allowing transfer of WFI to Coagadex 
freeze-dried product and of the reconstituted product into a syringe for administration.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Factor X is a glycoprotein of 59 kD composed of a light (17 kD) and a heavy chain (42 kD) linked by a 
single disulphide bond. Two posttranslational amino acid modifications facilitate calcium binding, which 
is necessary for functional activity: i) Gamma-carboxylation of eleven glutamic acid residues on the 
light chain and (ii) Beta-Hydroxylation of an aspartic acid on the epidermal growth factor-like regions 
of the light chain. Factor X is synthesised in the liver and secreted into the plasma as a precursor.  
Activation of factor X is catalysed by either the intrinsic factor Xase complex (FIXa, FVIIIa, membrane 
surface and calcium ions) or the extrinsic factor Xase complex (FVIIa, tissue factor, membrane surface 
and calcium ions) resulting in cleavage and release of an activation peptide. In the prothrombinase 
complex, FXa catalyses the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturer 
Manufacture of STABILISED FACTOR X Bulk Drug Substance is performed at a single location: 
Bio Products Laboratory Limited. (BPL), Dagger Lane, Elstree, Hertfordshire, WD6 3BX, United 
Kingdom 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The STABILISED FACTOR X bulk active substance manufacturing process is presented.  
These comprise the following stages: 
• Separation of cryoprecipitate and cryoprecipitate-depleted plasma (CPS) by controlled thawing of 
frozen plasma, followed by centrifugation. 
• Isolation of vitamin K-dependent proteins, including factors II, IX and X, from cryoprecipitate-
depleted plasma by adsorption on gel. 
• Virus inactivation by incubation with solvent and detergent 
• Partial separation of factors II, IX and X by chromatography. 
• Purification of factor X by chromatography. 
• Filtration of factor X through a virus-retentive filter and stabilisation. 
Control of Materials  
PMF (Plasma Master File)  
Coagadex active substance human coagulation factor X is manufactured from plasma for fractionation 
complying with Ph Eur (0853). A copy of the current EMA PMF Certificate of compliance with 
Community legislation (EMEA/H/PMF/000014/08/AU/009/G), issued by the EMA on 22 January 2015, 
has been provided in Module 1 of the application dossier. The PMF Certificate Holder is the Coagadex 
manufacturer: Bio Products Laboratory (BPL), Dagger Lane, Elstree, Herts, WD6 3BX. A clear reference 
to PMF, covering plasma for fractionation used for manufacture of Coagadex, has been included.  
Raw materials  
Raw materials used are pharmacopoeial (having reference to a monograph) with the exception of the 
three chromatography resins utilized. For these non-compendial raw materials internal specifications 
have been established. A certificate of analysis has been provided for each of the non-compendial raw 
materials.  
According to Guideline on plasma-derived medicinal products, manufacture of plasma-derived 
medicinal products starts from defined plasma pools and specifications of the plasma pool should be 
stated in the application dossier of the respective medicinal product. A clear reference to the PMF is 
acceptable with respect to the description and testing of the plasma pool for viral markers. The 
Applicant provided specifications of the plasma pools (e.g. protein concentration, bioburden) upon 
request. Overall, raw materials are controlled and comply with either Ph Eur or specifications of BPL.

Control of critical steps  
Critical process steps of the Coagadex drug substance manufacturing process identified by Failure 
Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) risk assessment (with regard to the quality target product profile and 
quality attributes) are limited to the virus inactivating steps.  
In-process controls (IPC) with defined acceptance limits for the critical steps have been established to 
ensure product quality and safety. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
Elements of Process Validation 
Process Validation for FACTOR X has adopted the principles of Process Design, Process Qualification 
and retrospective statistical process qualification. 
Process Design 
Process Design, based on the target product profile and quality attributes, is described as part of 
pharmaceutical development. 
Process Qualification 
Process performance qualification has been performed and is reported for the dedicated steps of 
FACTOR X bulk drug substance manufacture.  
Retrospective statistical process qualification 
Retrospective statistical process qualification has been performed on the established fractionation 
process steps according to process- and product- monitoring procedures using the data from historical 
batches. This retrospective approach was used due to the absence of a prospective process 
performance qualification protocol when these established steps were first introduced.  
The chosen methodological approach was Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to project high-
dimensional data clouds to lower dimensional spaces. Analysed outputs have been presented in various 
graphical forms (Summary of fit; X/Y Overview Plot PCA; Score Scatter Plot; Hotelling's T2 Plot) 
derived from an optimized model. Although, generally, this approach is considered acceptable, for ease 
of understanding a number of questions regarding presentation and explanation of the results of 
Principal Component Analysis were addressed and further clarified.  
Additionally, statistical process control charts (in form of Shewhart plots) displaying data measured on 
the process or product over time to detect e.g. process shifts, trends have been provided.  
Process Validation of Dedicated FACTOR X manufacturing steps 
Validation of the dedicated steps of FACTOR X bulk drug substance manufacture was performed by 
process performance qualification (PPQ) for three batches of FACTOR X bulk drug substance produced 
at commercial scale for provision of clinical material.  
A detailed Process Performance Qualification Protocol summarising process parameters and quality 
attributes to be tested has been provided. The Applicant stated in the Process Validation Report that 
the results were within the acceptance criteria without presenting the respective data. The relevant 
data was provided supporting the conclusion that FACTOR X is manufactured in a controlled and 
consistent manner.

EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 11/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Validation of repeat virus-filtration 
Exposure of FACTOR X intermediate to repeated filtration through virus-filters has been evaluated. 
Two studies have been  reported: the first evaluated the effect of repeat small-scale virus-filtrations of 
virus-filtered factor X intermediates from 3 batches which had been manufactured at full commercial 
scale; the second study evaluated the effect of repeated virus-filtrations at full commercial scale using 
one batch.  
Based on the validation data provided and taking into consideration that potential thrombogenicity is 
tested for at drug substance and drug product batch release, two consecutive (one-fold repeated) virus 
filtrations during manufacture of STABILISED FACTOR X drug substance are considered acceptable in 
the event of a technical failure.  Furthermore, criteria have been presented which may prompt a repeat 
(reprocessing) of the virus-filtration step. 
Reprocessing of process filtration  
Reprocessing step claimed for filtration of prothrombin complex solution has been justified by the 
respective experimental data.  Nevertheless, the reprocessing of the filtration step was restricted to 
one-fold (total of two consecutive filtrations). 
Storage Stability of Process Intermediates  
Hold times for process intermediates were confirmed with relevant provided stability data. 
Manufacturing process development 
The purification process of factor X utilises initial steps which were originally developed for the 
purification of other products. Factor X enriched intermediate (“Partially-Purified Factor X”) for FX 
production is a “by product” obtained during these process steps, thus complying with guideline on 
plasma-derived medicinal products (EMA/CHMP/BWP/706271/2010) which encourages the best use of 
plasma donations.  
Developmental studies on separation of prothrombin complex concentrate from cryoprecipitate-
depleted plasma by chromatography and Solvent/detergent treatment were performed using factor IX 
as substitute for the proteins of the prothrombin complex (including factor X). This approach is 
considered acceptable, since the studies are relevant for factor X as well. 
Evaluation Methods 
Each step of the FACTOR X bulk drug substance manufacturing process underwent two stages of 
pharmaceutical development. In the first stage, the process was derived by empirical experimentation, 
based on prior knowledge and experience. In the second stage, the robustness of the process step 
(also known as the design space) was determined by experimental design. These studies have been 
conducted using small-scale processes which are representative of the commercial-scale operation. 
The pharmaceutical manufacturing process development of each step is described according to these 
two stages. 
Additional data have been provided concerning manufacturing process development (rationale for 
selection of critical quality attributes, material attributes, presence of absence of significant changes in 
the manufacturing process development, meaning of design space on the manufacturing process).

Biological properties and Factor X Purity 
Seven batches of FACTOR X bulk drug substance were tested for biological properties and purity using 
factor X chromogenic, clotting and antigen assays, factor X specific activity, SDS PAGE and Western 
blotting. 
Use of three different assays to determine the concentration of factor X in seven FACTOR X bulk drug 
substance batches including two potency assays (chromogenic assay according to Ph Eur; clotting 
method and a Sandwich ELISA measuring factor X antigen) revealed differences in the results for the 
concentrations of factor X. The Applicant states that the bias between the assays all fall within a range 
considered being normal assay variation. This seems acceptable. 
Routinely, FACTOR X bulk drug substance potency is assigned using the chromogenic activity assay 
complying with the current Ph Eur compendial method (01/2008:20719). Validity of the assay to 
measure the biological activity has been demonstrated.  
Immunochemical properties 
An immunochemical method was developed to detect atypical factor X antigens (neo-antigens) which 
may be exposed or generated due to modification of the native molecule during the manufacturing 
process. Seven batches of FACTOR X bulk drug substance tested for evidence of neo-antigens using 
this method showed only trace amounts of neo-antigens.  
Impurities 
The purity of FACTOR X bulk drug substance, batches manufactured during process performance 
qualification (PPQ) were compared with previous batches which were manufactured to support pre-
clinical and clinical development of the FACTOR X product by using gel electrophoresis methods as well 
as tests for potential thrombogenicity.  
Characterisation of FACTOR X bulk drug substance impurities included testing for the presence of other 
plasma proteins which are co-purified during the FACTOR X manufacturing process.  
Based on the results of the potency assays used, published values for the plasma concentrations of 
these plasma proteins were used to calculate the contribution of each by weight to the overall 
composition of FACTOR X bulk drug substance. According to this, factor X is the predominant protein in 
FACTOR X bulk drug substance. The remaining protein is mostly factor II. Other plasma proteins 
comprise less than 1% of the total protein. 
Further clarification and data have been given concerning aggregates, process related intermediates 
and contaminants.  
Specification 
There are no pharmacopoeial monographs for human coagulation factor X. Thus compliance standards 
have been set by Bio Products Laboratory Limited (BPL) in line with ICH Q6B. The selection of tests to 
be part of the active substance batch release includes potency assay (factor X activity), excipients 
ranges (chloride and sucrose) and methods to control product-related impurities and process-related 
impurities.   
Pharmacopoeial methods are identified as such but not described, except for the active ingredient. 
Modified pharmacopoeial methods and non-pharmacopoeial methods are described. 
The potency (IU factor X/mL) of Coagadex drug substance and drug product is determined using the 
European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic assay indicated for human coagulation factor X

(01/2008:20719). This assay method consists of activation of factor X by Russell’s viper venom 
specific factor X activator, followed by enzymatic cleavage of a chromogenic factor Xa substrate to 
release a chromophore quantifiable by spectrophotometry. Under appropriate assay conditions, there is 
a linear relation between factor Xa activity and cleavage of the chromogenic substrate. 
Validation data for methods not applicable to drug product have been shown in the active substance 
section. Validation data for methods that are the same for bulk drug substance as for FACTOR X final 
drug product have been shown in the drug product section.   
Stability 
The FACTOR X bulk drug substance is stored frozen prior to manufacture of FACTOR X final drug 
product. A study was conducted to determine the storage stability of this bulk drug substance, using 
samples taken from commercial-scale batches. Samples were stored in at three temperatures (-20°C, -
30°C and -40°C) over a 9-month period. 
In both studies, stability-indicating parameters of functional activity, purity, potential thrombogenicity 
and physical chemistry were measured in samples stored between -20°C and -40°C. Three 
commercial-scale batches were tested for periods up to 9 months and one pilot scale batch (derived 
from commercial-scale manufacture) was tested for periods up to 12 months. 
The FACTOR X bulk drug substance factor X potency was within the control for all three batches under 
all storage conditions. Protein concentration, pH and conductivity remained consistent throughout the 
study for all samples and storage conditions, with no apparent trends. All samples passed tests for 
potential thrombogenicity throughout the study, with no apparent trends. 
The specific activity of all three batches remained within 80-120% of the time zero throughout the 
study and specific activity was considered to show no time dependent or temperature-dependent 
trend. 
Further clarification/data was requested with regard to storage of the active substance and has been 
provided. 
Based on both stability studies reviewed (commercial and pilot scale study), storage conditions 
proposed for FACTOR X bulk drug substance of up to 9 months, when stored at ≤ -20°C, are 
considered acceptable.  
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
The Applicant demonstrated that the drug substance manufactured by the validated process intended 
for commercial production is representative of drug substance manufactured for clinical use. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The active substance, FACTOR X of Coagadex is from human plasma.  
FACTOR X is a sterile, freeze-dried concentrate of human coagulation factor X. FACTOR X is presented 
as two dose sizes of 250 International Units (IU) and 500 IU of factor X (nominal). 
FACTOR X is supplied with Sterilised Water for Injections as solvent for reconstitution of the freeze-
dried powder. 2.5mL Sterilised Water for Injections is supplied with the 250 IU dose and 5mL Sterilised 
Water for Injections is supplied with the 500 IU dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 14/88 
 
 
 
 
 
A Mix2Vial is also supplied (CE mark Certificate: 346 EC and 510(k) number: K031861). This is a 
sterile, non-pyrogenic, single-use fluid transfer device that allows quick transfer of Water for Injection 
solvent to FACTOR X freeze-dried product, and of the reconstituted FACTOR X product into a syringe 
for administration. 
The composition of active substance in FACTOR X is 100 IU/mL (nominal) in both the 250 IU and 500 
IU dose size presented in Table 4 below: 
Table 1: Composition of FACTOR X active ingredient 
The choice of excipients is justified and their functions explained. 
The components are filled in type I glass vials with halobutyl rubber stoppers. The container closure 
system complies with Ph Eur requirements. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The formulation of FACTOR X final drug product has been derived from the composition of elution 
buffers used during chromatographic purification and stabilization of FACTOR X bulk drug substance. 
During development of those chromatographic steps, citrate and phosphate salts were used to buffer 
the pH and ionic strength was controlled using these salts in combination with sodium chloride. 
Additional formulation studies were performed to ensure that FACTOR X final drug product and the 
factor X active ingredient was stable during final freeze-drying, terminal heat-treatment, and 
subsequent long-term storage. 
Physicochemical properties: 
FACTOR X is a friable white or off-white freeze-dried powder which is readily soluble (not greater than 
5 min) in solvent (Sterilized Water for Injections). The re-dissolved solution is clear and colourless. 
After reconstitution, FACTOR X contains a low concentration of protein stabilized with buffer counter 
ions and sucrose. 
FACTOR X final drug product has been characterized using non-routine analytical methods, to evaluate 
the aggregates and degradation products in the reconstituted drug product. Based on this data, a 
specification for “Aggregates” at Coagadex drug product batch release may not be necessary.  
Biological properties: 
FACTOR X has been quantified by chromogenic activity assay, clotting assay and determination of 
factor X binding to an anti-factor X antibody. Results of the different assays showed that chromogenic 
assay and the clotting assay were equivalent. The bias between the chromogenic assays and the 
clotting assay was attributed to the individual assay accuracy and inter-assay variation. 
The protein composition and characterization of FACTOR X were described at pilot scale and at full 
commercial scale by different assays to measure factor X and protein impurities. Factor X is the 
predominant protein in FACTOR X final product. With the submitted data the remaining protein is 
mostly factor X. Other plasma proteins were only detected in small amounts.

With the non-activated partial thromboplastin time (NAPTT) assay clotting time after re-calcification 
was tested to look for possible activated coagulation factors, which would shorten the clotting time.  
Manufacturing process development 
The process of formulation development was an iterative process which embraced the three contiguous 
elements of formulation, freeze-drying and heat-treatment. This section describes the simultaneous 
pharmaceutical development of these three steps.  
A Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) and quality attributes were defined to include the relevant 
aspects of existing monographs for other coagulation factor products and the clinical and product 
characteristics required for a safe and efficacious treatment of factor X deficiency. The Applicant 
explained that each step of the FACTOR X manufacturing process underwent two stages of 
pharmaceutical development. In the first stage, the process was derived by empirical experimentation, 
based on prior knowledge and experience. In the second stage, the robustness of the process step 
(also known as the design space) was determined by experimental design. The design space 
robustness was determined by assessment of product outputs in response to adjustment of process 
control inputs over a pre-defined range. 
These studies have been conducted using small-scale processes which are representative of the 
commercial-scale operation. The starting material for such small-scale studies was drawn from an 
intermediate pilot-scale process or from the full commercial-scale manufacturing operation. 
Extensive examinations on the optimal Factor X intermediate and final product formulation, with 
different excipients, stability studies of FX with different pH conditions or different sugar/salt 
combinations were performed in order to get a formulation which provides sufficient product stability. 
The Applicant decided to pursue the development of a lyophilised dosage form. Therefore the 
formulation was optimized to get an appropriate lyophilised cake appearance. The heat treatment step 
was optimized and results of different studies confirm that most of the factor X functional activity is 
preserved across the heat-treatment process step.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturer of the FDP (final drug product) as well as names and addresses of testing laboratories 
are provided. Furthermore a representative batch formula has been provided that includes a list of all 
components to be used in the manufacturing process and their upper and lower limit of the amounts 
per batch has been provided. 
A description and detailed flow chart of the manufacturing process of FACTOR X Drug Product were 
provided. 
Critical steps in the FACTOR X final drug product manufacturing process were identified by Failure 
Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) risk assessment, with regard to the quality target product profile and 
quality attributes. Critical steps in the manufacturing process of FACTOR X Drug Product are defined 
and seem to be controlled by appropriate test methods with the exception of bioburden testing. 
Process Validation for FACTOR X follows the structure of Process Design and Process Qualification. 
Process Design, based on the target product profile and quality attributes, is described as part of 
pharmaceutical development. Validation of the manufacturing steps in general: The whole 
manufacturing process was evaluated in order to demonstrate that the process is capable to deliver a 
product that constantly meets predefined acceptance criteria. Deviations during process validation 
were identified and explained. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016

To review consistency of the manufacturing process of drug product of FACTOR X different PPQ batches 
and clinical batches with different test systems were tested. The Applicant compared the test results of 
the different non routine assays with data of previous studies. 
The Applicant restricted the reprocessing to two sterile filtrations and provided the criteria for 
reprocessing. 
Characterisation of impurities 
The impurities in FACTOR X were grouped into three classifications and tested in between 7 and 14 
batches: 
Plasma proteins impurities 
Plasma proteins impurities are the impurities in drug substance which are co-purified throughout the 
manufacturing process. The impurities in this group were analysed with non-routine methods and the 
concentration of all identified protein impurities was below reported concentration of those proteins in 
normal plasma. 
Non-protein impurities 
Non-protein impurities are introduced during the manufacturing process and may not be completely 
removed in the drug product.  
Chemicals which are added during the FACTOR X manufacturing process are measured in the routine 
testing of final product against specification. These comprise excipients (salts and stabiliser) present 
within specified limits and impurities added and then substantially removed during the manufacturing 
process. 
Protein activation, degradation or aggregation products 
The methods used to look for the presence of protein activation, degradation or aggregation products 
in FACTOR X batches were briefly described and results of tested FACTOR X batches were provided. 
Product specification 
There are no pharmacopoeial monographs for human coagulation factor X. Thus compliance standards 
have been set by Bio Products Laboratory Limited (BPL) in line with ICH Q6B.  
The finished product specification includes test for general attributes, potency (Factor X activity 
determined by the European Pharmacopeia chromogenic assay indicated for human coagulation factor 
X (01/2008:20719)), identity, purity, excipients ranges (chloride, phosphate, citrate, sucrose and 
sodium) and microbiological safety (sterility and endotoxins).  
The selection of tests for finished product batch release is acceptable. The proposed finished product 
specification raised some questions that were satisfactorily addressed. The proposed specifications are 
considered adequate. 
Analytical procedures 
Pharmacopoeial methods were identified as such but not described. Modified pharmacopoeial methods 
and non-pharmacopoeial methods were shortly described. 
Detailed method descriptions were provided. The use of the endotoxin test instead of the pyrogen test 
has been justified based on provided data as requested by the Guideline on the replacement of rabbit 
pyrogen testing by an alternative test for plasma derived medicinal products 
(EMEA/CHMP/BWP/452081/2007).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 17/88 
 
 
 
 
 
Reference Standard 
Issues concerning reference standards used have been adequately described by the Applicant.  
The Applicant states that factor X activity in the final drug product is measured against a factor X 
standard preparation. This is either the WHO International Standard for Factors II and X Concentrate 
(4th International Standard) (#11/126), or a local standard (6th British Working Standard for Blood 
Coagulation Factors II, IX, X, Concentrate (07/326) which has been calibrated against the 
contemporaneous WHO International Standard.  
The Applicant provided information on the characterisation of the in-house secondary standards and on 
their calibration against the WHO International Standard for Factors II and X Concentrate (4th 
International Standard). 
Stability of the product 
The Applicant claims a shelf-life of 36 months at+2°C to +30°C for the lyophilisate. 
Long term stability data from 6 manufacturing batches in the final container stored under the 
temperatures of +5°C, +25°C, +30°C for 36 months and +40°C for 12 months, with protection from 
light, have been provided. 
For one batch, which was used in the long time stability studies, the intermediate was stored frozen 
within 6 months.  
Two pilot scale batches were further tested for long term stability at +5°C, +25°C, +30°C for 36 
months and +40°C for 12 months. 
Additionally, all these batches were stored for 36 months at -40°C for use as a reference when 
estimating biological activity. 
Furthermore two reconstitution studies were presented.  
Study 1 was performed on FACTOR X 500 IU final drug product (2 commercial scale batches and 1 pilot 
scale batch), in accordance with batch availability and monitored stability of the reconstituted product 
for up to 1 hour at 25°C ± 2°C after reconstitution. 
Study 2 included the FACTOR X 250 IU final drug product (2 commercial scale batches) and extended 
the monitoring period to up to 2 hours at 25°C ± 2°C after reconstitution. 
Compatibility between FACTOR X and the Mix2VialTM needle-less transfer device, has been 
demonstrated. 
Issues were identified concerning storage of drug product and the reconstituted product that have 
been answered sufficiently. 
The results generated during the stability studies support the proposed shelf life of 3 years at+2°C to 
+30°C. After reconstitution, from a microbiological point of view, the product should be used 
immediately. 
However, chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 1 hour at room 
temperature (25°C ± 2°C). 
Finished product - Solvent WFI in 5 ml glass vials 
The information provided in the dossier for the solvent shows that the solvent Water for Injections 
(sWFI) is manufactured by Bio Product Laboratories Ltd, Elstree under GMP compliant conditions using

a validated process. sWFI is provided as 2.5 ml and 5.0 fill sizes in 5 ml type I glass vials. The vials are 
stoppered using a Halobutyl rubber stopper with Flurotec coating compliant with the requirements of 
the Ph Eur 3.2.9. The overseals are made of aluminium with a polypropylene flip off tamper evident 
cap. The sWFI meets Ph Eur requirements for sterile WFI and has a shelf life of 48 months when stored 
at +5°C to +30°C. The proposed shelf life conditions are supported by real time stability data. 
Adventitious agents 
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) 
Plasma is purchased from approved suppliers in the USA included in the Applicant’s centrally certified 
Plasma Master File (PMF).  
None of the FACTOR X excipients or manufacturing ingredients is of human or animal origin. 
Risk estimation with regard to TSE transmission was performed to a certain extent. 
TSE removal studies were performed for several manufacturing process steps. 
The results show that the different studied steps seem to be adequate to remove TSE. The global 
reduction factors were satisfactory. 
Viral Safety 
Plasma is purchased from approved suppliers in the USA included in the Applicant’s centrally certified 
Plasma Master File (PMF).  
An updated virus risk assessment was submitted to estimate the residual risk of viral transmission. 
Virus validation studies were performed for several manufacturing process steps. 
The results show that the different studied steps are effective and robust to inactivate/eliminate the 
model viruses.  
The manufacturing process has been sufficiently investigated for virus reduction. The global reduction 
factors were satisfactory. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends some points for investigation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacological properties of FACTOR X have been investigated in several in vitro studies. Safety 
pharmacology comprised investigation of thrombogenicity in vitro and in vivo in rats and rabbits. 
Toxicological studies have been conducted in rats and NZW rabbits. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted in four in vitro test systems. In vivo efficacy 
studies have not been performed in animals due the lack of an available animal model for factor X 
deficiency. FACTOR X was able to correct the coagulation defect in plasma in a dose dependent manner 
in several coagulation test systems (PT, APTT, TGA, TEG), which measured different characteristics of 
the coagulation pathway (table 14).

Table 2: Tabulated summary of Primary Pharmacodynamics In Vitro Studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies of FACTOR X have not been submitted (see discussion on non-
clinical aspects). Secondary pharmacodynamics of the excipients and impurities were presented as a 
bibliographic review of data and revealed no safety concerns. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Eight in vitro safety pharmacology studies derived from 6 complementary in vitro test systems and 3 in 
vivo studies in rats and rabbits were conducted to assess the thrombogenic potential of FACTOR X. In 
vivo hypercoagulability was investigated in a modified Wessler Test in rabbits, whereas the PT and 
APTT determination was part of the single dose (B74250) and repeat dose (C16823) toxicity studies in 
rats.  
The highest dose tested (2400 IU/kg BW) in animals with normal haemostasis was 40 times the 
intended maximum human prophylactic clinical dose (60 IU/kg BW).

In the in vivo studies there was no dose-dependent change in PT or APTT at day 2, 14 or 28 in male or 
female rats was detected.FACTOR X did not induce an acute thrombotic response or a chronic 
thrombotic response, even after high and repeated doses and no statistical significant difference in 
thrombogenicity scores could be detected between FACTOR X and control group.

No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Non–clinical pharmacokinetic studies were not submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose (IV) study in rats - B74250 (GLP):   
This was designed as a single IV administration of buffered saline (control), 60 IU/kg, 600 IU/kg and 
2400 IU/kg BW to 6 M/6 F HannRcc: WIST (SPF) rats 
There were 2 deaths: 1 animal died before treatment; 1 animal (60 IU/kg BW) died on day 15 during 
blood sampling, the administrations well tolerated. Single intravenous administration of FACTOR X at a 
dose level of 60, 600 and 2400 IU/kg BW had no influence on survival, body weight and food 
consumption. Early-onset and transient clinical signs were recorded in one isolated animal at the high 
dose group of 2400 IU/kg BW and had no impact on the macroscopic and microscopic findings. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 23/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FACTOR X at the low, mid and high dose caused no morphological alterations in the organs and tissues 
examined. The gross organ findings noted at necropsy were considered to be within the range of 
normal background lesions that may be seen in rats of this strain and age and were considered 
incidental, reflecting the usual individual variability. The no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) in this study 
was established at 2400 IU/kg BW, the highest dose used. The mode of administration reflected the 
clinical use (IV). No adverse effects were evident at the selected doses of 60 IU/kg, 600 IU/kg and 
2400 IU/kg BW. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
A repeat dose, 29 days, GLP compliant sub-acute toxicity study was conducted in Sprague Dawley rats 
(C16823) with IV dosing every other day of 0 IU/kg, 30 IU/kg, 120 IU/kg and 360 IU/kg BW to study 
toxicity, toxicokinetics and immunogenicity.

Figure 2: Mean Plasma Concentrations of FACTOR X in Male Rats on Day 29 
In overall, repeated doses up to 360 IU/kg BW (14 applications) within 29 days were well tolerated in 
rats. There were no test item-related effects on mortality, viability, clinical signs, food consumption, 
body weight, ophthalmoscopy, urine analysis, organ weights, macroscopic findings or microscopic 
findings. 
Sodium, calcium and phosphorus were elevated in some animals (male and female) in the mid- and 
high-dose groups (120 IU/kg BW and 360 IU/kg BW). In the absence of clinical findings or findings in 
related biochemistry parameters or microscopic findings of the kidneys or bones, these findings were 
considered to be not adverse.

The toxicokinetics of factor X were dose-dependent, without gender difference. Dose dependency was 
reduced after repeated treatment. This may be due to the presence of rat antihuman factor X 
antibodies, which could mask the detection of factor X. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were conducted (See discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted (See discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted (See discussion on non-
clinical aspects). 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data were obtained from the repeated dose toxicity studies and are discussed in the 
relevant section above. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance study in NZW rabbits - Study No.: C7092 
In this study coagadex was administered as I.V. in the right marginal ear vein; intraarterial: central 
right ear artery; paravenous injection: adjacent to right marginal ear vein; in one male / 2 females per 
group.  
Study and results are described in Table 18.

Other toxicity studies 
The antigenicity of FACTOR X has been evaluated by in vitro and ex vivo studies.  
Antigenicity test in vitro– Study Number: FXR361 
Antibodies which reacted with neoantigens associated with damaged factor X in preference to native 
factor X were raised in sheep and used in a semi-quantitative ELISA assay which was developed to 
differentiate between native factor X (negative response) and heat-damaged factor X. At equivalent 
Assessment report

Page 27/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentrations of factor X, the batches of FACTOR X were negative in the neo-antigen test, whereas 
different prothrombin complex concentrate products were positive to varying degrees. At equivalent 
concentrations of total protein, the batches of FACTOR X were slightly positive in the neo-antigen test 
and the responses were similar for the different prothrombin complex concentrate products tested for 
comparison. 
Based on in vitro antigenicity testing no neo-antigens were detected in FACTOR X, but to varying 
degrees in other clinical PCC products.  
Antigenicity ex vivo test – Study Number: FXR244 
A repeat dose, 29 days, toxicity study of FACTOR X was conducted in rats (C16823), (see repeat dose 
toxicity studies) in which, the formation of rat antibodies to human factor X was investigated and their 
neutralising (inhibitory) activity was measured by a semi-quantitative ELISA for antibodies to human 
factor X and a Bethesda assay (Nijmegen modification) for neutralising (inhibitory) antibodies 
At day 14 antibodies were detected in all test groups treated with FACTOR X, the response was slightly 
less in the lowest dose group (30 IU/kg) and some of the females in this group did not give a positive 
response. At doses of 120 IU/kg and 360 IU/kg the incidence of a positive response was 100%. After 
28 days the antibody response and incidence were similar for all FACTOR X dose groups, although 
females receiving the highest dose (360 IU/kg) showed a slightly higher response than the males. 
Using the Bethesda assay for neutralising antibodies, at 14 days all groups showed the same small 
inhibitory response, including the control group which did not receive FACTOR X. At 28 days, the 
average result was lower than at 14 days and the control group was found to be negative for inhibitory 
antibodies. However, the purpose of these studies was to determine whether there was a difference 
between the control rats and the rats receiving FACTOR X at various doses. There was no difference 
between the test and control samples at either the 14 day time-point or the 28 day time-point. 
Antibodies to human factor X were developed in nearly all rats of the verum groups. Development of 
antibody formation was not dose dependent and no neutralising antibodies were detected. However, 
this humoral immune response is an expected reaction reflecting the rat immune response to a foreign 
(human) factor X protein and is not considered an immunotoxic effect of FACTOR X. 
Immune response was not modified by treatment with FACTOR X. White blood cell count was normal in 
males. White blood cell count (lymphocytes and monocytes) and CD45RA+ were elevated and relative 
neutrophils were decreased in some females receiving the high dose of FACTOR X (360 IU/kg BW), 
possibly related to test item but of non-adverse character. The primary immune response (IgM) to 
sheep erythrocyte suspension was not impaired in any animals (treated as well as control animals). 
Excipients 
Excipients of FACTOR X are sodium citrate, mannitol, citric acid, sodium phosphate and sucrose. All 
excipients were within the specification limits, are well known and used widely in dietary and 
pharmaceutical products.  
The potential process impurities during manufacturing are small amounts. Residual impurities were 
within the specification limits.  
The content of product-related impurities was within the specification limits. Furthermore, the company 
evaluated the hazard about the impact and potential toxicity of these impurities on the basis of publicly 
available data. There was no indication of any hazard for human exposure.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the European Medicines Agency Guideline “Guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use” products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino 
acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), can be 
exempted from the submission of an ERA.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant conducted primary pharmacodynamic studies in four in vitro test systems to 
demonstrate efficacy of FACTOR X.  FACTOR X was able to correct the coagulation defect in plasma in 
a dose dependent manner in several coagulation test systems (PT, APTT, TGA, TEG) with different 
characteristics of the coagulation pathway. A bibliographic review of literature was presented for the 
excipients and impurities.  
In vivo efficacy studies have not been performed in animals due the lack of an available animal model 
for factor X deficiency. Furthermore, no secondary pharmacodynamic studies and no studies on 
pharmacodynamic drug interactions were performed since factor X is a plasma derived protein, which 
is agreed.  
No safety concerns were identified in safety pharmacology investigations examining thrombogenicity in 
several in vitro tests and 3 in vivo studies. The in vivo studies comprised one Wessler test in rabbits 
and thrombogenicity potential as part of the single dose and repeat dose toxicity studies in rats. No 
separate in vivo safety pharmacology study was performed, which is acceptable.  
The presented pharmacology studies reveal evidence that FACTOR X will exert haemostatic effects as 
desired. No potential risk of thrombogenicity and proteolytic activity in FACTOR X has been evaluated. 
The toxicology program covered in vivo toxicity studies in rats and evaluation of local tolerance in the 
rabbit. 
Single application of up to 2400 IU/kg to rats revealed no treatment related findings. A GLP compliant 
repeat dose toxicity study was performed in rats with IV dosing every other day (29 days 14 
applications). The limited duration of the study is acceptable due to the species specific 
immunogenicity, although clinically chronic administration is intended. Administration of FACTOR X up 
to 360 IU/kg was well tolerated. Sodium, calcium and phosphorus were elevated in some animals 
(male and female) in the mid- and high-dose groups (120 IU/kg BW and 360 IU/kg BW). In the 
absence of clinical findings or findings in related biochemistry parameters or microscopic findings of the 
kidneys or bones, those were considered to be not adverse. 
Adequate justification for not performing safety studies in higher animals species in accordance with 
the current guideline “Preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals 
(CPMP/ICH/302/95, ICH topic S6)” was provided recognizing the plasma derived nature of active 
ingredient.  This was also already addressed in the frame of an initial scientific advice procedure. 
No effects (macroscopically and histopathological) on the reproductive organs neither in male nor in 
female rats were seen. Plasma-derived coagulation factors have been widely used clinically and no 
adverse effects concerning fertility and reproduction have been reported.  
Due to the rarity of hereditary Factor X deficiency, experience regarding the use of Coagadex during 
pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, Coagadex should be used during pregnancy 
or breast feeding only if clearly indicated (see SmPC section 4.6).

Coagulation factor X is a plasma derived protein and is not expected to reveal carcinogenic potential 
therefore studies on carcinogenicity are not required, moreover proteins are not expected to interact 
directly with DNA or other chromosomal material and with reference to Guideline ICH S6(R1) 
mutagenicity studies are not to be performed. 
Coagulation factor X is a human protein and is not expected to cause reproductive and developmental 
toxicity. No morphological/histological changes in the reproductive organs in male or female rats were 
observed during the repeat dose toxicity study. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted 
with Coagadex (see SmPC section 4.6).  
Toxicokinetic analysis, as part of the repeat dose toxicity study revealed that all animals in all dose 
groups were exposed to FACTOR X. Systemic exposure of factor X increased in an approximately dose-
proportional manner across the dose range. There was no apparent gender-related difference in the 
extent of systemic exposure of factor X activity. Dose dependency was reduced after repeated 
treatment. This may be due to the presence of rat antihuman factor X antibodies, which could mask 
the detection of factor X. 
Based on in vitro antigenicity testing no neo-antigens were detected in FACTOR X, but to varying 
degrees in other clinical PCC products. Although clinical predictivity of this study may be considered 
questionable, the risk for antigenicity seems to be comparatively low for FACTOR X. Testing of 
antigenicity as part of the repeat dose toxicity study revealed antibodies to human factor X in nearly all 
rats of the verum groups. Nevertheless, development of antibody formation was not dose dependent 
and no neutralising antibodies were detected. However, this humoral immune response is an expected 
reaction reflecting the rat immune response to a foreign (human) factor X protein and is not 
considered an immunotoxic effect of FACTOR X. 
The immunotoxicity of FACTOR X was evaluated as part of the 29 day repeat dose toxicity study in 
rats. The expected immune response to sheep erythrocytes was not altered by treatment with FACTOR 
X: White blood cell count was normal in males, but slightly modified in some females in the highest 
dose group (360 IU/kg BW). Nonetheless, these changes are rather a response to repeated dosing with 
foreign human protein over 29 days than a compound specific immunotoxic effect. The primary 
immune response (IgM) to sheep erythrocyte suspension was not impaired in any animal.  
Based on results from the repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, a no effect level (NOEL) of 30 IU/kg BW 
and a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was identified above the highest dose tested (360 
IU/kg BW). The dose of 360 IU/kg BW was 6 times higher than the maximum intended prophylactic 
clinical dose of 60 IU/kg BW in humans. 
Local tolerance of FACTOR X was evaluated in a separate local tolerance study after IV, IA and 
paravenous injections in rabbits. FACTOR X was well tolerated after IV application at potencies of 600 
IU/kg BW. Intraarterial and paravenous application caused local tissue reactions, which were fully 
reversible and are not considered to warrant concerns regarding clinical safety. The excipients and 
impurities warrant no specific concerns. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, FACTOR X is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
Overall, the preclinical testing strategy is regarded as appropriate in view of the facts that the product 
is a preparation of a plasma derived protein. Clinical experience has already been obtained with 
prothrombin complex concentrates, where Factor X is a component together with other plasma derived 
products. As such by design – enrichment for Factor X and depletion of other (coagulation) proteins –

an increased safety profile is expected. The applicable regulatory guidelines were taken into 
consideration adequately.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The preclinical testing of factor X has been satisfactory, also in view of the nature of the product, a 
preparation of a plasma derived protein. Relevant information has been included in the SmPC. 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single and repeat-dose toxicity, thrombogenicity and local tolerability (see SmPC 
section 5.3). 
No investigations on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive or developmental toxitcity have 
been conducted since human plasma coagulation Factor X (as contained in Coagadex) is an 
endogenous protein (see SmPC section 5.3).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of FACTOR X, measured in terms of FX:C (using one-stage clotting and 
chromogenic assays) and FX:Ag activities, has been studied in two trials: Ten01 and Ten03. 
Ten01 was a phase III open, multicenter study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and 
efficacy of BPL’s FACTOR X in the treatment of severe and moderate factor X deficiency (basal FX:C 
level <5%). The PK of FACTOR X was investigated in 16 subjects with moderate or severe factor X 
deficiency in the Ten01 study, 15 of whom had repeat PK profiles according to the protocol. (See 
Clinical efficacy). 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Plasma concentration-versus-time curves were produced for FX:C (assayed using the one-stage 
clotting and the chromogenic assays) and FX:Ag, for the Baseline Visit (first PK) and the Repeat PK 
assessment (usually at the 6-Month Visit) for each subject with sufficient data points on both 
linear/linear and log10/linear scales. Actual post-dose sampling times were used. Mean plasma 
concentration-versus-time curves were produced for each visit. Summary statistics were calculated for 
plasma concentrations for each PK visit. For the purpose of estimating PK parameters relevant to 
exogenously administered factor X, the concentration of FX:C and FX:Ag at pre-dose was subtracted 
from all subsequent post-dose concentrations. The first post-dose occurrence of a negative 
concentration following subtraction of pre-dose would generally be deemed to signify the return of 
concentrations to baseline (pre-dose) levels, and subsequent time points would be ignored for PK 
purposes. PK parameters for each subject were estimated using WinNonlin PK software as appropriate. 
An assumption was made that data would most closely adhere to an intravenous bolus administration 
and a non-compartmental model in WinNonlin was used. Any use of alternative models would be 
detailed in the clinical study report. Whether an individual plasma concentration-versus-time curve was 
evaluable was determined using the r2 (adjusted) value assigned by the WinNonlin PK software to the 
curve fit for the non-compartmental analysis. If the r2 (adjusted) value was ≥0.8, the curve would 
automatically be considered evaluable. For any plasma concentration-versus-time profiles with r2 
(adjusted) <0.8, an assessment was made whether the profile was evaluable and could be included in 
the PK analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Plasma concentration data (pre-dose adjusted and unadjusted) were planned to be summarised by 
patient, sampling time and Visit (Baseline or Repeat PK Assessment), as appropriate; PK parameters 
(based on pre-dose adjusted data only) were summarised by Visit Day. All individual plasma (pre-dose 
adjusted and unadjusted) and PK parameter estimates were listed and summarised. Mean and 
individual plasma concentration versus time profiles were illustrated using both linear-linear and 
logarithmic-linear scales.

The protocol of the TEN01 study foresaw evaluation of single dose PK as the primary objective, 
evaluation of efficacy and safety 'only' as secondary objectives. The TEN01 protocol defined 'treatment 
success' based on two criteria, one of them being to demonstrate that the lower limit of 95% CI of t1/2 
was greater than 20 hours. 
Primary endpoints were Incremental recovery (IR) at 30 minutes post-dose (IR30min), apparent 
terminal t1/2 (non-compartmental), area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time 
zero to 144 hours (AUC0-144h), AUC estimated from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞), AUC from time 
zero to sampling time at the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t), systemic clearance (CL), mean 
residence time (MRT) estimated from time zero to infinity (MRT0-∞), volume of distribution (Vd), 
concentration at time zero (C0), maximum observed concentration (Cmax), time at which Cmax was 
apparent (tmax) and terminal elimination rate constant (λz) for FX:C (clotting and chromogenic) at the 
Baseline Visit and the Repeat PK assessment (usually at the 6-Month Visit). 
Summary statistics included number of patients (n), arithmetic mean and standard deviation (SD). 
Summaries for the PK parameters were displayed the median, minimum and maximum. In addition, 
with the exception of tmax, the geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation (CV) were 
reported for all PK parameters except tmax. 
Subjects had a blood sample for FX:C and FX:Ag assays collected at the Screening Visit and blood 
samples for FX:C and FX:Ag assays collected at the Baseline Visit and Repeat PK assessment (usually 
at the 6-Month Visit), pre-dose and at the following time points, for PK assessment: 15 minutes (± 5 
minutes) / 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) / 1 hour (± 10 minutes) / 3 hours (± 15 minutes)/ 6 hours (± 15 
minutes)/ 24 hours (± 60 minutes) (Day 2)/ 48 hours (± 2 hours) (Day 3)/ 72 hours (± 2 hours) (Day 
4)/ 96 hours (± 2 hours) (Day 5) / 120 hours (± 2 hours) (Day 6) / 144 hours (± 2 hours) (Day 7).

IR in surgery 
The pre-surgery IR30min results in the three subjects who underwent surgery, calculated using doses 
measured using the results from BPL’s chromogenic batch-release assay (First Subject: 2.34 IU/dL per 
IU/kg; Second Subject: 1.84 IU/dL per IU/kg; Third Subject 41001: 1.67 IU/dL per IU/kg), were 
similar to those in subjects undergoing PK assessments. However, the doses used were larger than 
those used in the formal PK studies (First Subject: 51.4 IU/kg; Second Subject :49.0 IU/kg; Third 
Subject : 45.0 IU/kg) because of the requirement to increase the pre-surgical FX:C to 70-90IU/dL. 
Study Ten03 
Ten03 was an open, multi-center, non-randomised prospective study in subjects with mild to severe 
factor X deficiency (<20% basal levels of FX:C) to assess the safety and efficacy of FACTOR X in 
preventing bleeding and achieving hemostasis during planned surgery. Assessment of incremental 
recovery of FX:C and FX:Ag after the pre-surgery bolus infusion was foreseen. 
The IR30 min values of FX:C (clotting and chromogenic assays) and FX:Ag after the presurgery bolus 
infusion were calculated, for the first loading dose in two male subjects undergoing 2 surgical 
procedures each.

During study Ten03, incremental recovery was investigated during four surgical procedures in 2 
subjects. Both subjects have mild congenital factor X deficiency, with values of 7 and 8 IU/dl at 
inclusion, respectively. Observed values are compatible with those from the formal PK evaluations of 
study Ten01.

Gender 
In the PK study Ten01, 10 subjects (62.5%) were female and 6 were male. In addition, two male 
patients were included in study Ten03 (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Race 
In study Ten01, 12 patients (75.0%) were white/Caucasian, 2 (12.5%) were black/African American, 
and 2 (12.5%) were Asian. Four subjects (25.0%) regarded themselves as Hispanic or Latino and the 
others as of other ethnicity. There were 1 white/Caucasian patient and 1 Asian patient in study Ten03 
(see discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Weight 
Subjects with a body weight from 41 to 119 kg) were included in study Ten01. In study Ten03 two 
patients were investigated with a body weight of 76 kg and 88 kg (see discussion on clinical 
pharmacology). 
Elderly 
No elderly patients were studied. The age range of enrolled patients was 12 to 58 years (see 
discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Children 
The ongoing study (Ten02) in children with mild to severe hereditary factor X deficiency has been 
granted a deferral for completion by October 2017 [EMA/PDC0/209107/2014 Corr].  
Six adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years of age were included. Full baseline and repeat PK data 
were measured (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Pharmacokinetics results 
Per the study protocol, all subjects in Ten02 were to receive FACTOR X prophylactic doses at 40 – 50 
IU/kg twice weekly to maintain trough FX:C concentrations of at least 5 IU/dL; the bolus dose used for 
incremental recovery (IR) evaluation was 50 IU/kg. 
Three subjects have completed the study (note 2 subjects completed the study 4 weeks early and will 
be re-entered into the trial). Thus far approximately 280 exposure days have been reported.   
The mean baseline IR30min = 1.77 IU/dL per IU/kg [range 1.41 to 2.20], and the mean Visit 5 
IR30min = 1.93 IU/dL per IU/kg [range 1.77 to 2.06].  The combined mean baseline and Visit 5 
IR30min = 1.81 IU/dL per IU/kg [range 1.41 to 2.20]. 
In subjects in the Ten01 study ≥ age 12, the mean IR30min, calculated using the factor X levels at 30 
minutes post-dose, was 2.04 IU/dL per IU/kg administered at the baseline Visit and 1.90 IU/kg per 
IU/kg at the repeat PK assessment visit. The IR at the repeat PK visit was statistically equivalent to 
that at the baseline visit. The range of IR30min in the population studied in Ten01 was from 1.40 to 
2.93 (IU/dL per IU/kg). The IR values currently demonstrated in study Ten02 are consistent with 
values reported in subjects ≥ 12 years of age in study Ten01.

Genetic differences in PD response 
In the Ten01 study, 16 subjects provided genetic samples for genotyping analysis on the specific F10 
gene mutation resulting in factor X deficiency. Twelve separate mutations in the F10 gene were 
identified. Nine of the 12 mutations were missense mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions, one 
was a deletion, one was a nonsense mutation and one was a splice site mutation. Four subjects had 
compound heterozygous mutations, one subject was heterozygous for a single mutation, and the 
remaining 11 subjects were homozygous for a single mutation. 
The subjects’ genotype was compared with the frequency of bleeds and selected PK parameters and no 
associations can be drawn between factor X genetic variants and clinical symptoms or the PK 
parameters.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic profiles after a bolus infusion of 25 IU/kg BW are available from 16 subjects for the 
initial evaluation and 15 patients for the repeat PK assessment at least 6 months later with severe or 
moderate congenital FX deficiency in study Ten01. The timing of blood samplings is adequate and 
covers about 5 half-lives of FX. Each subject’s set of plasma samples was assayed in a single run for 
both baseline and repeat PK assessment at the central laboratory which is acceptable. 14 subjects had 
severe Factor X deficiency (endogenous FX:C <1 IU/dL) and 2 subjects had moderate Factor X 
deficiency (FX:C >1 to <5 IU/dL). The inclusion of patients with moderate disease can be accepted 
with regard to the rarity of the disease.  
The PK profile of Coagadex was assessed by the clotting assay and the chromogenic assay measuring 
Factor X activity and the Factor X antigen assay. Choice and description of the applied PK parameters 
follow the current standards and are considered sufficient.  
Individual PK data of four patients show baseline FX:C levels (pre-dose) of at least 6 IU/dl. As there 
might be an impact of baseline FX:C levels >5 IU/dl on the PK results, a stratified re-analysis of PK 
according to FX baseline levels was performed and the effects of the raised pre-PK baseline were 
appropriately evaluated. In fact, AUC0-144h, Cmax, IR1h and t1/2 were significantly higher in subjects 
classed as baseline FX:C levels >5 IU/dL by the FX:C assay as compared to Factor X FX:C <1 IU/dL 
subjects. A reduction of these effects could be shown after accounting for covariates as weight, BMI, 
Lndose?, gender and age. Since there were only four of 16 patients with moderate elevation above 
baseline the effect on the overall PK data is regarded minimal. Nevertheless, the recommendation (see 
section 4.2. of the SmPC) to monitor blood levels after FACTOR X dosing is important and will also 
account for individual variability as well as weight or other demographic variables.

The PK data obtained in study Ten01 result in a mean IR of approximately 2.0 IU/dL per IU/kg and a 
half-life of 29.4 hours. Therefore, the criterion of treatment success that the half-life of FACTOR X 
(clotting assay) would be at least 20 hours (lower bound for the 95%CI) was achieved. The PK 
parameters for FX:C did not substantially differ between the clotting and the chromogenic assays. The 
FX:C PK data were quite similar between Baseline and Repeat PK visit and the 90% CIs of the mean 
Repeat PK/Baseline ratios ranged within the prescribed limits. Results are reflected in the SmPC 
section 5.2. 
The mean (CV%) for incremental recovery as 2.08 (18.1). The mean (CV%) maximun plasma 
concentration (Cmax) was 0.504 (17.2) IU/mL. The mean (CV%) for area under the curve (AUC 0-144h) 
was 17.1 (21.0) IU.hr/mL. As the human coagulation factor X is largely retained within the vascular 
compartment: mean apparent volume of distribution (Vss) was 56.3 (24.0) mL/kg. The mean (CV%) 
half-life of human coagulation factor X was 30.3 (22.8) hr and clearance was 1.35 (21.7) mL/kg/hr. 
The PK parameters for FX:Ag followed similar trends but an apparent disparity between the Baseline 
and Repeat PK results was observed. In addition, the CVs were almost universally larger than for FX:C 
(clotting and chromogenic) and were accounted for the difference between Baseline/Repeat PK. 
However, the FX:Ag assay was performed manually by ELISA which explains the greater CV in 
comparison to the clotting and chromogenic assays which was performed automatically. 
In study Ten01, additionally 3 patients underwent minor surgical procedures and incremental recovery 
of FX was available for the loading dose pre-surgery. 
PK parameters were also regarded as surrogates for efficacy by the applicant, which is considered 
acceptable for a plasma derived coagulation factor. PK parameters have been thoroughly characterised 
for plasma derived FX. The outcomes of this PK exercise provide the basis for dose level 
recommendations (IR ~2 IU/dl/IU/kg) and dose interval (t1/2 ~30h). Results achieved with the 
chromogenic and one-stage clotting assay are generally comparable. The repeat PK evaluation 
provided results very similar to those of the initial assessment. 
No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or in the 
elderly but there is no anticipated effect of age, gender, renal function or hepatic function on the 
pharmacokinetic profile of Coagadex.

There are limited data on long-term use. 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in children under the age of 12 years.  Data on 
incremental recovery is limited but appears similar to that seen in the patient population of 12 years of 
age or older. PK data in children < 12 years will be collected in the ongoing study (Ten02), which has 
been granted a deferral for completion by the PDCO. Until submission of this study report, missing 
data in children < 12 years are reflected in the summary of product characteristics. (See SmPC section 
5.2). 
Body weight/body mass index may have an impact on PK parameter and consequences on dosing. 
Further evaluation is needed. In addition, possible differences in PK characteristics between male and 
female subjects as well as adult and adolescent subjects have not been analysed. (See RMP). 
Study Ten03 was conducted in two patients with mild factor X deficiency who underwent two surgical 
procedures each. This trial is regarded only supportive for PK since solely IR30min values were 
calculated. In study Ten03 the median IR30min values were relatively close to the median values of 
the same parameter measured in study Ten01. 
Overall, the PK data presented support the efficacy of FACTOR X in providing hemostasis in patients 
with factor X deficiency. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK parameters of Coagadex have been thoroughly characterized for both FX:C (using the one stage 
clotting assay and the chromogenic assay) as well as for FX:Ag..The results have adequately been 
reflected in the SmPC. 
As the role of human plasma derived FX in the coagulation cascade is clear, the absence of 
pharmacodynamic studies is justified. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No specific dose response studies have been conducted. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study Ten01 
This was an open-label, multi-centre, nonrandomised, prospective study in subjects with severe and 
moderate factor X deficiency to assess the PK, safety and efficacy of FACTOR X. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
Inclusion criteria were: 
1. Subjects who had given written informed consent or, for subjects aged 12-17 years, who had given 
written assent and whose parent/guardian had given written informed consent. 
2. Subjects who were at least 12 years of age at date of written informed consent/assent. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 42/88 
 
 
 
 
 
3. Subjects with hereditary severe or moderate factor X deficiency (<5% basal FX:C at diagnosis). 
4. Subjects currently treated with FFP, a PCC, or a factor IX/X concentrate. 
5. Subjects must have had a minimum of one spontaneous or menorrhagic bleed in the past 12 
months which required treatment with FFP, PCC, or factor IX/X concentrate. Newly diagnosed 
subjects who presented at the hospital with a bleed could be included in the study (such subjects 
would not be included in PK analysis). 
6. Subjects must have had at least 7 days, and ideally 10-14 days, since an infusion of FFP, PCC, or 
factor IX/X concentrate at the Baseline Visit*. 
7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have had a negative result on a human chorionic 
gonadotrophin-based pregnancy test. If a female subject was or became sexually active, she must 
practice contraception by using a method of proven reliability for the duration of the study*. 
*Re-assessed before the PK assessment at the Baseline Visit. 
Exclusion criteria were: 
1. Subjects with a history of inhibitor development to factor X or a positive result at the Screening Visit 
(quantitative result of ≤0.6 Bethesda units [BU])*. 
2. Subjects who were bleeding at the appointment for the PK assessment*. However, the subject could 
enter the study after the bleed was controlled. 
3. Subjects who had thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 X 109/L)*. 
4. Subjects who had clinically significant renal disease (serum creatinine >200μmol/L)*. 
5. Subjects who had clinically significant liver disease (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT] levels 
>3× upper normal limit)*. 
6. Subjects who were known to have other coagulopathy or thrombophilia. 
7. Subjects known or suspected to have hypersensitivity to the investigational medicinal product or its 
excipients. 
8. Subjects known to have abused chemicals or drugs within the past 12 months. 
9. Subjects with a history of unreliability or non-cooperation. 
10. Subjects who were participating or who had taken part in another trial within the last 30 days, with 
the exception of BPL’s FACTOR X surgery study (protocol code Ten03). In such cases, subjects 
should have completed their End-of-Study Visit in the other trial before or on the day of the 
Screening Visit for this study. 
11. Female subjects who were pregnant or lactating. 
12. Subjects who were planning more than 4 weeks’ absence from the locality of the investigational 
site between the Screening Visit and the PK assessment. 
*Re-assessed before the PK assessment at the Baseline Visit. 
Treatments 
Patients received their first dose of FACTOR X at the investigational site and underwent assessments 
during the Baseline/Day 1 visit. Subsequently, patients could be provided with FACTOR X for home 
administration or administration at their local clinics as agreed by the investigator. It was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 43/88 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended that the first bleeding episode be treated under the supervision of a physician. 
Alternatively, patients could return to the investigational site for treatment. 
Selection of Doses in the Study 
The standard dosage for the bolus administration, to treat a bleed, and preventative therapy was 25 
IU/kg, which was based on the empirical finding that 1 IU/kg of factor X administered can raise a 
patient’s factor X level by 1.5 IU/dL. Any unused portion of reconstituted FACTOR X solution was 
discarded. 
Dose to Treat a Bleed 
Spontaneous bleeds were initially treated with a single dose of 25 IU/kg FACTOR X, which was 
expected to raise the factor X level by approximately 35-40 IU/dL. Additional doses could be given as 
necessary until haemostasis was restored. 
If more than two doses of FACTOR X were required to treat an overt bleed or menorrhagia, or if more 
than three doses of FACTOR X were required to treat a covert bleed, the treatment for that specific 
bleed would be considered a treatment failure. If a dose of 25 IU/kg of FACTOR X was insufficient to 
treat a bleed in a subject, the dose for subsequent bleeds in that subject could be increased, but 
justification for the change in standard dose had to be recorded in the subject’s CRF. 
Preventative Therapy 
Some subjects might need to administer FACTOR X prophylactically for a short period for reasons such 
as in anticipation of increased physical activity or during rehabilitation of a joint following a bleed. This 
use was documented as preventative therapy. A dose of 25 IU/kg should be administered, with the 
calculated total dose rounded to the nearest 1 mL. Unlike treatment for bleeds, the dose for 
preventative therapy was fixed throughout the study for any subject. If a female subject was treated in 
anticipation of a menorrhagic bleed, the response to FACTOR X was assessed as treatment of a bleed, 
not as preventative treatment. 
Surgery 
Subjects requiring any surgical or invasive procedure during the course of the trial, whether planned or 
emergency, could do so using FACTOR X if the local laboratory at the main investigational site or other 
hospital at which the surgery was performed had the facilities to accurately monitor the subject’s FX:C 
levels. Subjects might undergo more than one such procedure during the study. Before the 
commencement of any surgical procedure, a subject must have attended Day 1 of the Baseline Visit 
and should ideally have completed all PK assessments to 144 hours post-dose. 
Surgical procedures requiring day case or overnight stay, such as laparoscopic or arthroscopic 
procedures, were defined as minor procedures. Procedures typically requiring full anaesthesia and 
involving opening of the major cavities, such as thoracic, abdominal, orthopaedic or open heart 
surgery, were defined as major procedures. 
Pre-surgery Loading Dose 
A dose of FACTOR X required to raise the subject’s factor X level to 70-90 IU/dL was calculated by the 
investigator, according to the following equation: 
dose required (IU) = weight (kg) X rise required (IU/dL) X 0.7 
The above equation was based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor X/kg bodyweight raises the 
factor X level by 1.5 IU/dL. However, if the subject’s observed recovery at the Baseline Visit was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 44/88 
 
 
 
 
 
significantly different to this value, the equation above could be adjusted to ensure that a factor X level 
of 70-90 IU/dL was reached. The initial dose was not to exceed 60 IU/kg. 
The bolus loading dose of FACTOR X was given between 1 and 4 hours before surgery. The subject 
could receive an additional dose of FACTOR X after the pre-surgery loading dose. This might be 
required if the surgery was delayed to more than 8 hours after the loading dose, or if local laboratory 
tests indicated that the required level of FX:C was not reached. The assessment of IR was performed 
on a blood sample taken 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) after the first pre-surgery dose of FACTOR X. 
Post-surgery Maintenance Doses 
During the first few days after the surgical procedure, FX:C was monitored at least once daily while the 
subject was in hospital and further doses of FACTOR X were given as required targeting the FX:C level 
to be at least 50 IU/dL, calculated by the investigator according to the equation above, or adjusted to 
account for the subject’s observed recovery at the Baseline Visit. Treatment with FACTOR X continued 
until the subject was considered to no longer be at risk due to post-operative bleeding and returned to 
the on-demand treatment regimen. The duration of post-surgery maintenance dosing was anticipated 
to be 5 to 10 days. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the PK of FACTOR X after a single dose of 25 IU/kg in 
subjects with severe or moderate factor X deficiency. 
The secondary objectives were: 
1. To assess the efficacy of FACTOR X in the treatment of spontaneous bleeds over at least 6 months. 
2. To assess the safety of FACTOR X in the treatment of spontaneous bleeds over at least 6 months. 
3. For factor X-deficient subjects enrolled in the study who needed a surgical procedure, an additional 
objective was to prospectively investigate the safety and efficacy of FACTOR X, administered by 
bolus infusion, to control bleeding and achieve haemostasis. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Because the investigational medicinal product in this study contained biologically active, endogenous 
compounds, the PK variables below were used as a surrogate for efficacy variables. The main PK 
parameters of FX were defined as the primary efficacy endpoints and additional ones as secondary 
(See PK section of this AR). Clinical efficacy endpoints included the following assessments: 
• Total dose of FACTOR X (IU and IU/kg FX:C), total number of infusions and average dose per 
infusion to treat a new bleed and ongoing bleeds, for any additional preventative use and overall 
use per subject; 
• Total dose of FACTOR X (IU/kg FX:C) to treat a bleed (including initial dose for new bleeds and any 
repeated doses for ongoing bleeds), number of infusions and dose per infusion on a per bleed and a 
per subject basis; 
• Dose of FACTOR X per infusion for all infusions, all infusions to treat bleeds, all first infusions to treat 
bleeds, all subsequent infusions to treat bleeds and all infusions given as a preventative measure. 
• Average monthly and yearly dose of FACTOR X (IU/kg FX:C) and average monthly and yearly 
number of infusions to treat a bleed, for any additional preventative use and overall use per 
subject; 
Assessment report

Page 45/88 
 
 
 
 
 
• Investigator’s overall assessment of efficacy as ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘poor’ or ‘unassessable’; 
• Number of exposure days overall and per subject; 
• Average number of bleeds per subject per month; 
• Number of bleeds including severity, duration, location and cause; 
• Subject’s assessment of efficacy (all bleeds) as ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘poor’ or ‘unassessable’; 
• Investigator’s assessment of efficacy (bleeds requiring assessment at the hospital) as ‘excellent’, 
‘good’, ‘poor’ or ‘unassessable’. 
Assessment Criteria for Efficacy in Treating a Bleed 
The clinical manifestation of factor X deficiency includes covert (hidden) as well as overt (obvious) 
bleeds. The assessment of efficacy of FACTOR X in treating a bleed depended on the type of bleed to 
be assessed. Efficacy was assessed by the subject for all bleeds and by the investigator or a trained 
clinician for bleeds requiring assessment at the hospital/clinic. 
Overt bleeds 
Examples of overt bleeds were epistaxis, tongue/gum bleeds, haematemesis, haematuria, rectal 
bleeding and external wound bleeding due to injury. Overt bleeding was assessed at 12 hours and, if 
necessary, at 24 hours after the first dose of FACTOR X. Efficacy was assessed by the investigator and 
subject according to the guidelines shown in Table 24 and Table 25 below. 
Table 12: Criteria for assessment of efficacy of FACTOR X in treating an overt bleed: 
investigator’s assessment

Table 13: Criteria for assessment of efficacy of FACTOR X in treating an overt bleed: 
subject’s assessment 
Bleeding should have been assessed as close to the 12-hour and 24-hour time points as possible. 
Menorrhagia 
Menorrhagia, although an overt bleed, may vary significantly within individuals from one menses to the 
next. Efficacy was based on the number of doses of FACTOR X required in the peri-menstrual period 
(the first dose being not more than 1 day before commencement of bleeding) to maintain bleeding at a 
manageable level (i.e. with no significant limitation to normal activities), as shown in Table 26 and 
Table 27 below.

Table 15: Criteria for assessment of efficacy of FACTOR X in treating a menorrhagic bleed: 
subject’s assessment 
Covert bleeds 
Examples of covert bleeds were melena, intraperitoneal bleed, joint bleeds, muscle bleeds, intracranial 
haemorrhage, haematoma/bruising and internal bleeding due to injury. Assessment of covert bleeds, 
which might not have associated pain, was difficult, since it was not always possible to ascertain the 
start and stop time of bleeding, the severity and timescale of response to therapy. 
Efficacy was assessed by the investigator and subject, based on the number of doses of FACTOR X 
required to achieve haemostasis within 48 hours after the first dose, according to the guidelines shown 
in Table 28 and Table 29 below. The bolus infusion of 25 IU/kg FACTOR X could be repeated to achieve 
haemostasis. For gastrointestinal ulcers, failure to achieve haemostasis did not equate failure of the 
efficacy of FACTOR X, since even patients without factor deficiencies would continue to bleed with 
these lesions.

Investigator’s Overall Assessment of Efficacy 
At the End-of-Study Visit, the investigator made an assessment of the overall efficacy of FACTOR X 
throughout the study, taking into account its use in all bleeds, preventative doses and surgical 
procedures. For any subject who withdrew from the study but did not attend an End-of-Study Visit, 
efficacy would be assessed by the investigator if the subject had received at least one infusion of 
FACTOR X for treatment of a bleed, for preventative use, or for surgery. Efficacy was assessed 
according to the criteria in Table 30. 
Table 18: Criteria for investigator’s overall assessment of efficacy 
Sample size 
No formal sample size calculation was performed, as no formal hypothesis testing was planned. The 
sample size is based on formal scientific advice received from the EMA and FDA. A minimum of 12, and 
a maximum of 16 subjects were planned to be enrolled to receive FACTOR X on demand in order to 
achieve at least 12 evaluable pharmacokinetic profiles at the Baseline Visit and the 6 Month Visit and, 
separately, at least 12 bleeding episodes treated with FACTOR X in 12 subjects.  
Randomisation 
This was a single-arm trial. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was not blinded. 
Statistical methods 
The following analysis populations were planned for this study: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 49/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety Population (Safety): The safety population will be defined as all treated subjects (i.e. all 
subjects who receive at least part of one dose of study medication). Safety data will be analysed up to 
the point of withdrawal for subjects who withdraw if the number of data points is adequate to allow a 
scientific analysis. 
Per-Protocol Population (PP): The PP population will be defined as all treated subjects who have 
sufficient FX:C data to characterise the time course of FACTOR X in plasma (i.e. a PK profile evaluable 
by WinNonlin) at the Baseline Visit and the repeat PK assessment (usually at the 6 Month Visit). 
Surgery Population (Surgery): The surgery population will be defined as all treated subjects requiring 
any surgical or invasive procedure during the course of the trial, whether planned or emergency, who 
receive at least one part of one dose of study medication as prophylaxis against excessive bleeding 
during or after the procedure. 
Per-Protocol Surgery Population (PP Surgery): The PP surgery population is a subgroup of the surgery 
population, which includes subjects undergoing surgical procedures in which the pre-surgery FX:C level 
is ≥70 IU/dL and in which subjects were dosed in accordance with the protocol. 
The most important evaluation of efficacy of FACTOR X was based on the subject’s assessment of each 
new bleed. FACTOR X was planned to be deemed effective if at least 80% of a subject’s treated new 
assessable bleeds for on demand treatment are assessed as having an ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ response. 
All other efficacy endpoints (as listed above) have been analysed descriptively.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendments 
The Ten01 protocol version 2 (incorporating protocol amendments [PA] 01-02), dated 02 Nov 2009, 
was used at the start of the study. Ten amendments were made during the study, most noteworthy: 
the 2nd was to add definition of treatment failure, as recommended by FDA; 3rd was an update in 
definitions of efficacy criteria, as recommended by FDA; the 5th was the addition of success criteria, as 
recommended by FDA; the 7th was an update in efficacy assessment criteria for menorrhagic bleeds.  
Amendment (PA05) dated 22 Sep 2010 incorporated the following changes: Addition of blood sample 
collections for thrombogenicity marker assays at 24, 48 and 72 hours post-dose time points; Change 
to the infusion rate from a maximum of 3 mL/min to a suggested rate of 10 mL/min but no more than 
20 mL/min (The initial infusion rate ceiling was based on administration instructions of BPL’s other 
coagulation factors. Because of the low amount of protein in FACTOR X, the low infusion volume and 
the lack of evidence that faster infusion rates were associated with AEs, the infusion rate was 
increased.); Clarification on the efficacy assessment of FACTOR X in treating a bleed if the 
investigator’s and the subject’s assessments differed.

Three subjects enrolled at sites in Spain were enrolled before this amendment and therefore did not 
undergo the revised procedures related to the thrombogenicity marker assays at the Baseline Visit or 
the infusion rate requirement.  
Amendment (PA06) incorporated the following changes: Addition of a table listing the number of 
bleeds required to meet the criteria for treatment success. The maximum number of bleeds, defined up 
to 20 in the previous protocol version, was increased due to the number of bleeds reported at the 
time; Addition of the PK parameter AUC0-t in the analysis. This parameter was identified as necessary 
during a review of the statistical analysis plan. 
An amendment (PA08) dated 09 Aug 2012 incorporated a change to the primary efficacy endpoint for 
the surgery component of the protocol (as per the request by the PEI) and to ensure that the surgery 
data analysis in Ten01 was consistent with the surgery data analysis in the Ten03 study and a change 
to the secondary efficacy endpoints for the surgery component of the protocol as a consequence of 
above change to the primary endpoint as requested by PEI. Two subjects underwent surgical 
procedures during the study before this amendment and therefore efficacy assessments reflect the 
previous version of the protocol. 
Protocol Deviations 
Only minor deviations occurred, none of them was considered a protocol violation or a serious breach; 
thus, no subject was excluded from planned PK analysis. Two subjects received FACTOR X as routine 
prophylaxis, even though this use was not specified in the protocol.

Baseline data 
Table 19: Subject demographics 
Baseline Clinical Characteristics and Disease History 
Of the 16 subjects in the safety population, 14 had severe factor X deficiency with endogenous FX:C 
level <1 IU/dL and 2 subjects had moderate disease with endogenous FX:C level in the range of 1 to 
<5 IU/dL. 
The subjects had been diagnosed with factor X deficiency for a mean duration of 20.7 years. Before 
entering this study, 15 subjects had been treated with replacement factor concentrates, 14 had been 
treated with FFP and 12 had been treated with other blood products. Fourteen subjects (87.5%) had 
experienced spontaneous bleeding in the past. 
A bleeding score (modified Vicenza score) based on that developed for von Willebrand disease was 
used to grade the severity of bleeds in the subject’s disease history. 
Assessment report

Table 20: Bleed history 
Of the 16 subjects in the safety population, 14 had severe factor X deficiency with endogenous FX:C 
level <1 IU/dL and 2 subjects had moderate disease with endogenous FX:C level in the range of 1 to 
<5 IU/dL. 
The subjects had been diagnosed with factor X deficiency for a mean duration of 20.7 years. Before 
entering this study, 15 subjects had been treated with replacement factor concentrates, 14 had been 
treated with FFP and 12 had been treated with other blood products. Fourteen subjects (87.5%) had 
experienced spontaneous bleeding in the past. 
Numbers analysed 
16 patients were enrolled into the trial.  
The per-protocol population included 15 subjects who received FACTOR X for treatment of bleeds and 
had sufficient FX:C data to characterise the time course of FACTOR X in plasma at the Baseline Visit 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016

and the Repeat PK assessment (typically at the 6-Month Visit). One subject was excluded from the 
per-protocol population because the subject discontinued the study (death) before the Repeat PK 
assessment. 
The surgery population included 3 subjects who received FACTOR X as prophylaxis against excessive 
bleeding during or after their surgical procedure. Two of the subjects were included in the per-protocol 
surgery primary analysis population and secondary analysis population. One subject was included in 
the surgery population but excluded from the per-protocol surgery primary analysis and per-protocol 
surgery secondary analysis because the pre-dose FX:C level was ≥20 IU/dL. The safety population 
included 16 subjects who received at least one dose of FACTOR X during the study. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Treatment of Bleeding Events 
A total of 228 bleeds were documented, 208 of which were treated with FACTOR X. Figure 9 shows the 
number of bleeds included in the analyses. 
Figure 6: Numbers of bleeding episodes reported and included in the analyses 
A total of 207 on-demand bleeds in 16 subjects were reviewed by the DRC, for which a bleed severity 
(major/minor/not known) has been assigned. Of these, 187 bleeds were selected by the DRC. The 
treatment success rate in these 187 bleeds is presented in Table 33 below. Nearly all (98.4%) of the 
bleeds treated with FACTOR X were considered a treatment success (i.e. excellent or good response). 
The 95% CI for treatment success rate is 96.2 to 99.9%. When the one bleed considered unassessable 
by the subject was excluded, 98.9% of the assessable bleeds treated with FACTOR X were considered 
a treatment success. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 55/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 21: Treatment success rate in bleeds selected by the DRC 
Among the 208 on-demand bleeds treated with FACTOR X, there were 6 treatment failures in 2 
subjects (one with a covert muscle bleed that required 4 infusions and as a consequence treatment of 
future bleeds for this subject was increased to 33 IU/kg FACTOR X per dose; a subject with a 
menorrhagic bleed requiring 3 infusions; a major traumatic joint bleed with a delay in treatment not 
accounted for and a menorrhagic bleed). Among the 187 bleeds that were selected by the DRC to be 
included in the assessment of outcome, 4 treatment failures (2.1%) are included.  
Assessments of bleeds were made by investigators for 42 bleeds in 10 of the 16 subjects. Of these, 37 
(88.1%) responses were categorised as excellent, 4 (9.5%) as good and 1 (2.4%) as poor. 
Preventative Dosing 
Nine subjects received a total of 184 infusions of FACTOR X for preventative use during the study 
period; however, one subject for whom the doses administered in the 2 infusions given for 
preventative use were not recorded is excluded from the summary statistics of dose. The mean dose 
per infusion was 25.24 IU/kg per subject, similar to the standard dose of FACTOR X of 25 IU/kg. The 
total number of infusions of FACTOR X for preventative use during the study period ranged from 1 to 
70 infusions per subject, with a mean of 20.4 infusions per subject, equivalent to a monthly average 
ranging from 0.1 to 4.8 infusions per subject per month, and a mean of 1.62 infusions per subject per 
month. 
Of the 184 preventative doses, 56 (30.4%) were given as secondary prophylaxis to prevent re-
bleeding and 45 (24.5%) were given as a short-term preventative measure (e.g. before increased 
physical activity). Routine prophylaxis in two subjects discussed below accounted for 57 (31.0%) of 
preventative infusions. This was a deviation from the treatment regimen prescribed in the protocol. 
Prophylactic infusions for both subjects were administered at the investigational site. The remaining 26 
(14%) of preventative infusions were administered for a variety of reasons, such as dental/orthodontic 
visits and prophylaxis for a rectal bleeding. 
Routine prophylaxis 
One Subject received a total of 20 infusions as routine prophylaxis for a duration of 878 days or 28.9 
months. During the total period of 7.2 months on routine prophylaxis, the subject did not report any 
bleeds. In the non-prophylaxis periods the subject reported a total of six bleeds. Thus, it appeared that 
the once-weekly routine prophylaxis reduced the bleeding frequency in this subject from 0.23 bleeds 
per month to 0 bleeds per month. Another subject received a total of 37 infusions as routine and 
secondary prophylaxis (discussed below). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 56/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary prophylaxis  
One subject received a total of 37 infusions as routine prophylaxis. This subject commenced once-
weekly routine prophylaxis at a FACTOR X dose of 24.6 IU/kg per infusion of FACTOR X, with the 
sponsor’s approval, on 17 Jan 2011 following a series of serious joint bleeds. Secondary prophylactic 
dosing to prevent re-bleeding in this patient was given to this subject in 3 cases of a spontaneous joint 
bleed. In the first cased the subject received 14 infusions of 25 IU/kg FACTOR X at the investigational 
site 0, of which 10 were on consecutive days. The first infusion was given to treat the bleed and the 
remaining 13 infusions were given as secondary prophylaxis, to prevent re-bleeding. The second time 
the subject received nine infusions (first one to treat the bleed and the remaining eight as secondary 
prophylaxis) of 25 IU/kg FACTOR X at the investigational site all on consecutive days. The third time 
the subject received eight infusions of 25 IU/kg FACTOR X at the investigational site all on consecutive 
days; the first 2 were  to treat the bleed and the remaining six infusions were given as secondary 
prophylaxis to prevent re-bleeding. During the 8.5 months the subject had seven bleeds. Thus, it 
appeared that the once-weekly routine prophylaxis reduced the bleeding frequency in this subject from 
0.82 bleeds per month to 0 bleeds per month. 
Investigator's Overall Assessment of Efficacy 
In the 16 subjects in the safety population, the investigator assessed the overall efficacy of FACTOR X 
in 15 subjects (efficacy was not assessed for a subject who did not attend an End-of Study Visit). Of 
these 15 subjects, the investigator assessed the overall efficacy of FACTOR X during the study as 
excellent in 12 subjects (80%) and good in 3 subjects (20%). 
Number of Bleeds per Subject 
For the 16 subjects in the safety population, there was a mean of 13.1 bleeds per subject, and a mean 
of 13.0 bleeds treated with FACTOR X per subject, ranging from 1 to 59 bleeds. The median number of 
bleeds per subject per month was 0.85. 
Consumption 
Total dose of FACTOR X on a per bleed and per subject basis 
For treatment of a bleed, including initial and repeat doses, the mean total dose of FACTOR X was 
31.75 IU/kg per bleed and the mean number of infusions was 1.2 per bleed. A total of 170 bleeds 
(81.7%) were treated with one infusion, 32 bleeds (15.4%) needed two infusions, 3 bleeds (1.4%) 
needed three infusions, 1 bleed (0.5%) needed four infusions and 2 bleeds (1.0%) needed six 
infusions. The mean dose per infusion of FACTOR X on a per bleed basis was 25.43 IU/kg for overall 
use. 
The average mean dose per infusion of FACTOR X per subject was 25.44 IU/kg for overall use, 25.37 
IU/kg for treating bleeds, 25.50 IU/kg for treating new bleeds, 25.25 IU/kg for treating ongoing bleeds 
and 25.24 IU/kg for any preventative use. 
Average monthly dose of FACTOR X 
The mean average monthly dose of FACTOR X for overall use was 63.07 IU/kg/month. The average 
monthly dose of FACTOR X per subject was 57.99 IU/kg/month for on demand use treatment of bleeds 
and preventative use, 33.40 IU/kg/month for treating bleeds, 25.88 IU/kg/month for treating new 
bleeds, 13.95 IU/kg/month for ongoing bleeds and 46.10 IU/kg/month for additional preventative use.

Three subjects received FACTOR X before undergoing surgical procedures to prevent excessive blood 
loss. The surgical procedures for two of them (both tooth extractions and considered minor) were 
included in the per-protocol analysis, whereas the surgical procedure for a third subject who 
underwent a multiple-tooth extraction (also minor) was excluded from the per-protocol analysis as this 
subject’s plasma FX:C levels were ≥20 IU/dL at the pre-surgery visit. The investigators assessed the 
overall efficacy of FACTOR X to be excellent in both subjects by the following parameters: 
Clinical estimation of volume of blood loss during surgery: Blood loss was rated as ‘as expected’ for 2 
Subjects and ‘less than expected’ for a third Subject on Day 1 (as soon as possible after wound 
closure) and at subsequent time points. 
Requirement of blood transfusion: No blood transfusion was required or given for any of the three 
subjects. 
Number and duration of post-operative bleeding episodes: None of the subjects experienced any post-
operative bleeding complication or bleeding episodes at a location other than the site of surgery. 
Measurement of haemoglobin pre-operatively, post-operatively and at discharge: There was no 
apparent change in haematocrit or haemoglobin levels before and after the surgical procedure for 2 
Subjects,  for a third Subject, both haematocrit and haemoglobin levels decreased following surgery 
and remained lower than the normal range at discharge. 
Analysis of Clinical Information Relevant to Dosing Recommendations 
In the Ten01 study up to and including the cut-off date, the nominal dose of 25 IU/kg appeared to be 
effective in the on-demand treatment of most bleeds (treatment success rate: 98.4%; 95% CI 96.2 to 
99.9%). The doses given were generally around this level (mean 25.25; SD ± 2.449 IU/kg). Therefore, 
an initial dose of 25 IU/kg would seem to be appropriate for the first dose to treat a bleed whether 
overt, covert or menorrhagic and irrespective of the site. The majority of the bleeds responded to a 
single dose with the mean (± SD) number of doses per bleed being 1.2 (0.47). Because the mean (± 
SD) overall dosage to treat a bleed was 30.37 ± 12.467 IU/kg per bleed this indicates that the 
subsequent doses were of a similar magnitude (25.3 IU/kg; i.e. 30.37/1.2).

Children 
The ongoing study (Ten02) in children with mild to severe hereditary factor X deficiency has been 
granted a deferral for completion by October 2017 [EMA/PDC0/209107/2014 Corr]. The Applicant has 
provided an update on the status of Study Ten02 in paediatric patients including preliminary data. 
Study Ten02 is an open-label, multi-centre trial evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy 
of BPL’s FACTOR X concentrate, in the prophylaxis of bleeding in subjects < 12 years of age. The study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 61/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is being conducted at three sites in the UK, and is currently ongoing. The clinical study report with final 
data from study Ten02 is expected in Q3 2017. 
Although the planned recruitment was completed, two subjects were discontinued early in error by the 
site. The two subjects met the 50 exposure days criterion but were released from the study four weeks 
early. Due to the rarity of paediatric factor X deficient patients, these two patients are expected to be 
re-screened and re-consented and repeat the entire study. The current recruitment status is presented 
in Table 36 below: 
Table 24: Ten02 Recruitment status (cut off Nov 30, 2015) 
Reported Bleeds 
Eight bleeds reported in  four subjects were presented. Four of these bleeds were  from  injury,  one 
spontaneous  and  three  were  menorrhagic.  All  were  considered  minor bleeds except one 
menorrhagic bleed which was considered major. No other bleed information is available at this time. 
Supportive study 
Ten03 
Ten03 was an open, multi-centre, non-randomised prospective study in subjects with mild to severe 
factor X deficiency (<20% basal levels of FX:C) to assess the safety and efficacy of FACTOR X in 
preventing bleeding and achieving hemostasis during planned surgery conducted from 29 June 2012 to 
03 April 2013. 
Subjects were enrolled at two study sites in two countries: USA (Study site 22) and UK (Study site 
05).  
A target of a minimum of five and a maximum of ten subjects were intended to be enrolled in order to 
achieve a minimum of ten evaluable surgical procedures. However, data collected on surgical 
procedures from BPL's FACTOR X pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety study (Protocol Ten01) could be 
combined with the data collected in this Ten03 surgery study. In this case, the number of subjects and 
procedures required in the Ten03 could be reduced accordingly. Subjects could also take part in this 
study more than once (for each surgical procedure they undertook). 
On Day 1, subjects received a pre surgery bolus dose of FACTOR X between 1 and 4 hours before the 
surgical procedure that was anticipated to raise the FX:C level to 70-90 IU/dL. After surgery, subjects 
remained in the hospital receiving maintenance doses of FACTOR X until they were no longer 
considered to be at risk of significant bleeding as a result of the surgical procedure. However, as 
determined to be appropriate by the investigator, the final few doses of FACTOR X to control bleeding 
from the surgical procedure could be self-administered after an early discharge from hospital. Subjects 
who were discharged early were given a subject diary to complete at home. The duration of treatment 
for most subjects was anticipated to be 5 to 10 days (maximum up to 21 days), including one or more 
pre-surgery loading doses, followed by maintenance doses. Subjects could receive treatment for a 
shorter period for minor procedures.

The primary efficacy endpoint was blood loss during and after surgery assessed using the following 
parameters: 
1. Clinical estimation of volume of blood loss during surgery 
2. Requirement for blood transfusion (units of packed red blood cells or units of whole blood) or 
infusion of autologous red cells during and after surgery 
3. Number and duration of post-operative bleeding episodes 
4. Measurements of haemoglobin pre-operatively, post-operatively and at discharge  
The variables above were combined into an overall assessment of blood loss during and after surgery 
relative to blood loss typically expected in a normal patient (i.e. someone without a bleeding disorder) 
undergoing the same surgical procedure. This assessment was made by the investigator and by the 
DRC after all other factors which might affect the blood loss had been taken into account. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
1. Assessment of incremental recovery of FX:C and FX:Ag after the pre-surgery bolus infusion 
2. Assessment of FX:C and FX:Ag levels on each day post-surgery 
3. Assessment of the cumulative weight adjusted doses of FACTOR X as measured by FX:C (IU/kg 
body weight) administered to each subject to maintain haemostasis 
4. Assessment of the cumulative doses of FACTOR X as measured by FX:C (IU) administered to each 
subject to maintain haemostasis 
5. Amount of weight adjusted FACTOR X as measured by FX:C (IU/kg body weight) administered daily 
(day of surgery and each post-operative day) to maintain haemostasis 
Results 
Four surgical procedures in two male subjects have been studied, all of which were classified by the 
DRC as major, namely, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and, 3 months later, molar and premolar 
teeth extractions (6); total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and 4 months later a TKA on the other knee. The 
ages at the time of the procedures ranged from 55 to 59 years, one subject was Asian and the other 
Caucasian. Both subjects had mild factor X deficiency with lowest recorded FX:C of 6 and 8 IU/dL; one 
had a history of post-operative bleeds only and the other had a life-time history of two spontaneous 
bleeds, one mild and the other major. 
Doses for adjusted FX:C (clotting) ranged from 30.88 to 54.41 IU/kg, for FX:C (chromogenic) from 
32.97 to 52.40 IU/kg and for FX:Ag from 39.85 to 65.60. 
Approximately 30 minutes after an infusion of FACTOR X, the incremental recovery (IR 30min) for 
FX:C (clotting) ranged from 1.80 to 2.27 IU/dL per IU/kg and that for FX:C (chromogenic) had a 
similar range (1.82 to 2.10 IU/dL per IU/kg). For FX:Ag, the range was appreciably wider (1.71 to 4.24 
IU/dL per IU/kg). However, the median values were similar (2.24, 2.00 and 2.02 IU/dL per IU/kg 
respectively). 
The pre-surgical doses (from 30.88 to 54.41 IU/kg) raised the subjects’ FX:C (clotting) levels by 70 to 
120 IU/dL. The median levels over the post-operative period from Day 2 onwards ranged from 0.36 to 
0.48 IU/mL (36 to 48 IU/dL) with an absolute range across subjects of 0.23 to 0.69 IU/mL (23 to 69 
IU/dL) on Days 8 and 6 respectively. The median total dose of FACTOR X infused pre-surgery was 
38.65 IU/kg. The median number of infusions was 13 per subject. The median total dose of FACTOR X 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 63/88 
 
 
 
 
 
to maintain hemostasis was 180.65 IU/kg. The estimated volume of blood loss at wound closure was 
‘as expected’ for three of the four surgical procedures (75.0%) and ‘less than expected’ for the CABG. 
None of the subjects had any bleeds during the study. None of the subjects required any blood 
transfusions during the study. 
All subjects' haemoglobin and haematocrit levels were within normal range before surgery. In one 
procedure (teeth extractions), haemoglobin and haematocrit levels remained within the normal range 
throughout but, in the other three procedures, haemoglobin and haematocrit levels decreased below 
the lower limit of the normal range at either the 2 hour post-surgery time point or discharge/early 
discharge or both. The mean value of haemoglobin was 157.8 g/L pre-surgery, which was 145.8 g/L at 
2 hours post-op and 121.8 g/L at end of treatment period. The respective values of haematocrit were 
47.43 %, 44.10 % and 38.25 %. However, none of the levels were considered clinically significant by 
the investigators. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The open-label, unblinded design of the submitted pivotal clinical trial Ten01 investigating the efficacy 
of Coagadex in 16 patients with hereditary FX deficiency is considered adequate in light of the orphan 
setting and the given design and objectives of the trial, where it is evident that feasibility issues drive 
the number of patients enrolled. The targeted patient/bleeding numbers were achieved. The focus of 
data analysis is on the thorough description of the PK/efficacy/safety data observed in the patient set 
investigated. For most important outcome measures, point estimates were planned to be reported 
together with confidence intervals, which is acceptable. 
The investigated patient population was multi-national and included 6 adolescents (between 12 and 17 
years of age) and 10 adults. Fourteen subjects (87.5%) had severe Factor X deficiency (endogenous 
FX:C <1 IU/dL) and the other two subjects had moderate deficiency (FX:C >1 to <5 IU/dL). The 
included population is considered to be adequately representative of patients with hereditary FX 
deficiency. 
Apart from the thorough characterisation of the PK parameters of this plasma derived FX, the efficacy 
in the treatment of bleeding events and for surgical procedures was investigated. The use as a 
secondary prophylaxis to avoid rebleeding e.g. after joint bleeds and as a short-term prevention before 
anticipated physical activity was also foreseen in the protocol.  
Study Ten03 enrolled two male patients with mild factor X deficiency (endogenous levels of FX being 7 
and 8 IU/dL, respectively), who underwent four major surgical procedures (2 each). This study was 
curtailed after advice received from CHMP indicated that surgical data from Ten03 together with 
surgical data from Ten01 could be sufficient to support assessment of the effects of FX in invasive 
procedures. 
After advice received at a Follow-up Protocol Assistance procedure indicated that the already collected 
data on 6 surgical procedures in 4 patients might be sufficient to show evidence of the safety and 
efficacy of FACTOR X in surgery, Ten03 was curtailed after two subjects, with two surgical procedures 
each, completed the study, since at that point 2 of the 3 surgical procedures in Ten01 had taken place. 
As subjects were consented for each surgery separately, the total enrolment in Ten03 is considered 
equivalent to four study subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 64/88 
 
 
 
 
 
Mild congenital FX deficiency is usually defined as plasma levels below 10 IU/dl. The inclusion criteria 
allowed enrolment subjects with FX activity up to 20 IU/dl. As the two enrolled subjects had baseline 
values of 7 and 8 IU, respectively, this criticism is considered not relevant. 
The two subjects underwent 4 major surgeries without any bleeding complications. In fact blood loss 
was ‘as expected’ in 3 patients and ‘less than expected’ in one patient, which, taken together with the 
other outcomes available, is considered adequate proof of the efficacy of FX substitution for surgical 
interventions. 
The most important evaluation of efficacy of FX was based on the subject’s assessment of each new 
bleed. FX was planned to be deemed effective if at least 80% of a subject’s treated new assessable 
bleeds for on demand treatment were assessed as having an ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ response. This 
criterion is defined on a 'per-patient' level and can hence only be assessed per patient. The SAP, 
however, foresees in addition a 95% CI for the proportion of excellent/good response in all bleeds over 
all patients, assuming independence between bleeds within patient.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study Ten01, all sixteen (16) patients received FACTOR X for on-demand treatment of 208 
spontaneous, menorrhagic or traumatic bleeds of which 187 bleeds in 15 subjects were selected for the 
analysis by the DRC who categorised the majority as major (98; 52.4%). The majority were covert 
(110; 58.8%) with 16 (8.6%) overt (79 were spontaneous and 47 traumatic) and 61 (32.6%) 
menorrhagic. These bleeds occurred in various locations: mucosal 73 (39.0%); joint 63 (33.7%); 
muscle 26 (13.9%), cuts/wounds 4 (2.1%) and other 21 (11.2%). Additionally, three minor surgical 
procedures (tooth extractions) were performed during study Ten01, with satisfactory outcomes. 
Two patients with recurring bleeding events even used routine FX infusions as a long-term prophylactic 
treatment although this constituted a protocol deviation. For the use as long-term prophylaxis, 
available data indicate that it was effective in both patients and reduced the bleeding rate meaningfully 
(to 0 for both subjects). Other preventative doses accounted for 56 (30.4%) infusions which were 
given as secondary prophylaxis to prevent re-bleeding and 45 (24.5%) infusions which were given as a 
short-term preventative measure (e.g. before increased physical activity).  In only three cases new 
bleeding event started within 24 hours of the preventative infusion, of which two were menorrhagic 
bleeds. This supports the usefulness of FX for short-term prophylaxis. 
Of the 208 captured spontaneous, traumatic or menorrhagic bleeds, 187 were selected for evaluation 
by the DRC. 90.7% of those bleeding events were assessed as having an excellent response to FX and 
7.5% as having a good response. Thus, a satisfactory effect in the treatment of bleeding events was 
shown for Coagadex. The observed number of bleeds was heavily dominated by one subject, who 
experienced the most bleeding events during the study, i.e. 59. Nearly all of those bleeding events 
(BEs)(56 out of 59) were selected by the DRC for evaluation. Therefore the assessment of efficacy of 
FX was heavily influenced by the assessment of one specific subject. The applicant has provided a 
sensitivity analysis of the treatment of bleeding events that excluded bleeds experienced by this 
subject. It was shown that the proportion of bleeding events assessed as having an excellent or good 
response stays consistently high. The efficacy of FX treatment was also shown to be similarly 
satisfactory for minor and major bleeds.  
With regard to preventative treatment with FX, 56 (30.4%) infusions were given as secondary 
prophylaxis to prevent re-bleeding and 45 (24.5%) infusions were given as a short-term preventative 
measure (e.g. before increased physical activity). Only in three instances a new bleeding event was 
reported during the next 24 hours, of which 2 were menorrhagic bleeds. This supports the usefulness 
of short term preventative use. Investigators’ overall assessment of efficacy was good (20%) or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 65/88 
 
 
 
 
 
excellent (80%) for all evaluated subjects (15 out of 16), illustrating that the observed efficacy is 
regarded as beneficial also from the clinicians view. 
The efficacy in surgery is supported by the three minor surgeries undertaken during study Ten01, 
where FX substitution was shown to be adequate to prevent excessive bleeding. In addition, in study 
Ten03, two patients underwent 4 major surgeries without any bleeding complications. The efficacy 
assessment was excellent in all seven surgical procedures performed in five patients. Blood loss was as 
expected or reduced. No post-operative transfusions were needed. There was no clinically significant 
drop of haemoglobin levels and haematocrit. Due to the high target levels of 70-90% Factor X the pre-
surgery doses ranged from 30.9 to 54.4 IU/kg. However, all four major surgical procedures were 
performed in patients with only mild factor X deficiency. Surgical data in patients with severe factor X 
deficiency were only available in two minor interventions of tooth extraction. However, it is agreed that 
there is no data to suggest that dosing or monitoring should be different in patients with severe factor 
X deficiency undergoing major surgical procedures. The inclusion of dosing recommendations for all 
severity grades and major procedures in the SmPC was considered appropriate to provide relevant 
guidance to clinicians caring for these rare patients (see SmPC section 4.2.). Nevertheless, CHMP 
recommends the applicant to submit the report of the outcomes of major surgeries undertaken in three 
additional patients with moderate to severe FX deficiency post marketing. 
Safety and efficacy data in both Ten01 and Ten03 studies are based on a maximum recommended 
dose of 60 IU/kg. Although this dose was exceeded in one subject a maximum daily dose of 60 IU/kg 
is recommended as a precautionary measure (See SmPC section 4.2.). 
The update on the status of Study Ten02 in the prophylaxis of bleeding in paediatric patients ( < 12 
years of age) was submitted during the assessment and included preliminary data. The fact that the 
planned recruitment (of 8 patients) was even exceeded as 9 patients are already enrolled provided 
enough reassurance to the CHMP that an indication of Coagadex across age groups will not have a 
negative impact on the completion of the PIP.   
Study Ten02 is an open-label, multi-centre trial evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy 
of FACTOR X concentrate, The study is being conducted at three sites in the UK, and is currently 
ongoing. The clinical study report with final data from study Ten02 is expected in Q3 2017. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The Applicant provided an overview over the current status of study Ten02 in children below 12 years 
of age, and preliminary data were in line with those observed in patients ≥12 in study Ten01. The final 
clinical study report is expected by end 2016 – See RMP. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Data from trial Ten01 are considered sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of Coagadex for the 
treatment of bleeding events in patients with hereditary FX deficiency in surgical procedures as also 
supported by the results of study Ten03. The efficacy of preventative infusions in relationship to the 
time to the start of a new bleeding event provides evidence of short-term prophylactic use of FX. 
Available data from two patients who received long term prophylaxis confirm that these patients 
experienced no bleeding events for the duration of therapy. Preliminary data from the ongoing 
paediatric study Ten02 support efficacy across age groups and provide reassurance on the completion 
of the ongoing PIP. Further efficacy data in children aged less than 12 years with Hereditary Factor X 
Deficiency will be available from study Teno2 (PIP). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

* In general this refers to 6 months and 12 months continuous exposure data, or intermittent 
exposure. 
In the study Ten01, 16 subjects received at least one dose of FACTOR X for on-demand treatment for 
bleeds, for prophylaxis of bleeds and/or for controlling bleeding during surgical procedures. The mean 
(±SD) duration of study participation was 457.9 (±284.32) days per subject. During this time, there 
were a total of 468 infusions given of which 242 were for treatment of bleeds, 184 as preventative 
treatment, 31 for PK assessments, 6 for surgical procedures and 5 at a batch change. 
The number of infusions of FACTOR X overall ranged from 5 to 115 per subject with a median of 20.0 
per subject. Mean total number of infusions per subject given for overall use was 29.3. Exposure days 
per subject ranged from 3 to 111, median 17.0 days. The monthly average use, for all uses, ranged 
from 0.3 to 9.6 (mean 2.33) infusions per subject per month. 
The mean dose per infusion overall was 25.47 IU/kg per subject. The recommended dose of 25 IU/kg 
FACTOR X to treat a bleed was maintained during the study for 14 of the 16 subjects. The other two 
subjects used doses of up to 30 IU/kg and 33 IU/kg. 
In the study Ten03, 2 male subjects, received FACTOR X for controlling haemostasis during two 
surgical procedures each. Their surgical procedures were all regarded as major by the DRC: one 
subject had a coronary artery bypass graft and, at a later date, six dental extractions; the other 
subject had two total knee arthroplasties about 4 months apart. 
Total exposure days in Ten03 were 40, a mean of 10 per surgical procedure. The median number of 
infusions per procedure was 13, mean 10.8 and range 2 to 15. The pre-surgery doses ranged from 
30.6 to 49.2 IU/kg with a median of 38.65 IU/kg and mean of 39.28 IU/kg. The total dose of FACTOR 
X in Ten03 ranged from 44.6 IU/kg to 210.1 IU/kg with a median of 180.65 IU/kg and a mean of 
154.00 IU/kg. 
Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) were analysed in several ways: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 67/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• All treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) irrespective of the time of occurrence in relation to any infusion 
• Product-associated AEs  
- infusion-associated i.e. onset within 24 h of start of infusion of FACTOR X, or 
- classed as related/possibly related to FACTOR X, or 
- where causality was missing or indeterminate 
• Product-related AEs  
- classed as related/possibly related to FACTOR X 
In both studies, all product-associated AEs had an onset within 24 hours of the start of infusion of 
FACTOR X so the data for product-associated and infusion-associated are identical; only ‘infusion-
associated’ will be used for further reference. There were no AEs in which causality was missing or 
indeterminate. 
The definition and capture of adverse events is in principle acceptable. However, no adverse events of 
special interest for coagulation factor replacement have been defined. Allergic reactions, thrombotic 
events, adverse events related to bleeding, infections and hepatobiliary events are considered of 
special relevance for a plasma derived coagulation factor and analyses presenting the incidence and 
severity of all AEs captured by these terms should be submitted by the applicant.  
All 18 individual subjects (100%), in Ten01 and Ten03 combined, experienced at least one treatment-
emergent AE (TEAE). 
A total of 202 treatment-emergent AEs were reported: 176 in study Ten01 and 26 in study Ten03. 
Most of these AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Of the 202 treatment-emergent AEs, 6 (3.0%) 
were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to the study drug. There were a total of 84 
infusion-associated AEs: 71 in Ten01 and 13 in Ten03.  
Ten01 and Ten03 differ because in Ten01 infusions of FACTOR X were given intermittently and when 
required to stop a bleed or as a preventative measure, so infusions were widely spread and were rarely 
given on a daily basis; in general, each subject in Ten01 usually received many more infusions that the 
subjects in Ten03, whose infusions were given daily over a relatively short period. 
All 18 individual subjects (100%), in Ten01 and Ten03 combined, experienced at least one treatment-
emergent AE (TEAE).

*for Ten03, the number of subjects is the number of surgical procedures, not of individual subjects 
The most common Infusion-associated AEs were: 
Headache 4 subjects (20%) and 7 reports (8.3% of all this category of AEs) 
Nausea 3 subjects (15%) and 7 reports (8.3% of all this category of AEs) 
URTI 3 subjects (15%) and 5 reports (6.0% of all this category of AEs) 
Nasopharyngitis 3 subjects (15%) and 4 reports (4.8% of all this category of AEs) 
Arthralgia 3 subjects (15%) and 4 reports (4.8% of all this category of AEs) 
Product-related AEs (ADRs) 
Product-related AEs (i.e. ADRs) were those categorised by the investigator as very likely, possibly or 
probably related causally to FACTOR X. Two subjects (12.5%) experienced a total of six events, 
considered by the investigator to be ADRs. No subject in Ten03 experienced an ADRs.  
Of the total of 202 TEAEs, six (3%) were regarded as ADRs, which represented 7.1% of the 84 
infusion-associated AEs. None was serious.

Infusion site pain 1 subject (5%), 1 report of mild severity 
Fatigue 1 subject (5%), 1 report each of moderate and mild severity 
Lower back pain 1 subject (5%), 1 report of mild severity 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
One subject in the Ten01 study died of pneumonia and nosocomial infection. This subject developed 
pneumonia about 3 weeks after the first dose of FACTOR X and was hospitalised until she died about 
45 days later after nosocomial infection complicated by multi-organ failure. The events were 
considered unrelated to FACTOR X treatment. There were no other deaths in either study. 
Including the one death (in Ten01), a total of 6 subjects experienced a total of 13 treatment emergent 
SAEs, all of which occurred in the Ten01 study. There were three bleeds in two subjects, three 
worsening of anemia in two subjects, one of whom also had acute gastritis and the other one 
worsening gastric ulcer with H pylori infection, one syncope, one tooth abscess and one dysmenorrhea. 
All SAEs were deemed unrelated to FACTOR X treatment. There were no treatment-emergent SAEs in 
Ten03. 
Laboratory findings 
No clinically significant trends of abnormality were observed in any of the laboratory indicators, 
haematology, biochemistry, and PT and APTT during the study period of both trials (Ten01, Ten03).  
There were no clinically significant changes in viral serology suggesting seroconversion in either study. 
In the Ten01 study, the thrombogenicity markers d-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), and 
prothrombin fragments 1+2 (F1+2), were measured at intervals up to 72 hours post-dose at the 
Baseline visit (16 subjects) and at the Repeat PK visit (15 subjects). All thrombogenicity profiles in 
which any one result exceeded the upper limit of the normal range were reviewed by the Data Review 
Committee (DRC). The DRC did not consider any subject’s thrombogenicity results to be indicative of a 
possible thrombogenic effect of FACTOR X. A genuine thrombogenic response to FACTOR X would be 
expected to cause an early, substantial and sustained elevation of all three parameters at the Baseline 
visit, which would be reproduced at the Repeat PK visit; however, this was not observed in any 
subject. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
The patient sample size was too small to allow for the analyses of FACTOR X safety by demographic 
and clinical characteristics. All subjects in the Ten01 and Ten03 studies were aged 12 years or older. 
Extrinsic Factors 
The patient sample size was too small for analyses of FACTOR X on the basis of ethnic factors as 
defined in ICH E5 guidance. No potential interactions of FACTOR X with other drugs, use of tobacco, 
use of alcohol, or food habits were observed in the Ten01 and Ten03 studies. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Neither clinical trial investigated the effect of FACTOR X in pregnancy and lactation. As a naturally 
existing protein derived from human plasma, FACTOR X is not expected to be teratogenic. Factor X is 
not likely to cross the placenta or to be excreted into milk.

Overdose 
One case of overdose was reported in study Ten01. On 01 July 2013 subject 35001 received 80 IU/kg 
instead of 25 IU/kg to treat a bleed as a result of a dosing error, which was above the maximum 
recommended dose of 60 IU/kg. Plasma FX:C was not measured, but based on the subject’s observed 
incremental recoveries the factor X level would be expected to rise to 99-150 IU/dL. No adverse events 
were reported relating to this overdose. An overdose of FACTOR X may present theoretical risks of 
thrombosis. 
Factor X inhibitors 
In the Ten01 and Ten03 studies, all study subjects tested negative for factor X inhibitors throughout 
the study periods. When the PK parameters for FX:C (measured using the one-stage clotting assay) at 
the Repeat PK visit were compared with those at the Baseline visit (Ten01), the DRC found no 
indication of development of covert factor X inhibitors. 
Infusion Site Observations 
Infusion site observations (for discomfort, erythema, induration, tenderness and warmth) in Ten01 
were performed immediately before each post-dose sample at the Baseline visit, the Repeat PK 
assessment and any Batch Change visits. One subject (21001) had a mild reaction 15 and 30 minutes 
post-dose at both the Baseline and Repeat PK visits. One subject had moderate discomfort, mild 
erythema and mild warmth pre-dose at the Repeat PK visit. No other symptoms were noted. In Ten03, 
all infusions were well tolerated without any infusion site reactions. 
Immunogenicity  
There were 3 reports of infusion site reactions in 2 patients (2 erythema, 1 pain), which were all mild 
and considered as ADRs.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interactions of FACTOR X and other drugs or with certain types of foods have not been studied. 
Theoretically, FACTOR X should be used with caution in combination with other coagulation factor 
products, including prothrombin complex concentrates or fresh/frozen plasma. 
There are no known theoretical drug interactions, except that the effects of FACTOR X are likely to be 
counteracted by factor Xa inhibitors. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Apart from the one death, due to pneumonia and nosocomial infection, no subject discontinued study 
participation due to AE. 
Post marketing experience 
FACTOR X has not been marketed in any country. However, FACTOR X has been supplied to 13 
patients completing study Ten01, and at least 5 patients in the UK not enrolled in study Ten01, on a 
compassionate use basis. 
One miscarriage (BPL incident number QR 81002) was reported in a subject receiving once weekly 
FACTOR X 1500 IU (approximately 20 IU/kg). The subject became concerned she might be pregnant 
and sought medical advice. β-HCG levels, measured on the day after vaginal bleeding commenced, 
were low, indicating the pregnancy was not intact prior to the abortion, hence the bleeding was a 
consequence and not a cause of the abortion. A diagnosis of spontaneous abortion at 6 weeks + 3 days 
was made. This event was classed as serious and unrelated to FACTOR X.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data are based on exposure of 18 subjects (> 12 years) with hereditary factor X deficiency to 
FACTOR X (Coagadex).  
Generally, adverse event reports are to be within the expected range of the anticipated safety-profile 
of coagulation factor products. FACTOR X intravenous infusions were well tolerated. Two patients 
experienced a total of six events, considered to be ADRs: infusion site erythema (1 subject; 2 reports), 
Infusion site pain (1 subject), Fatigue (1 subject; 2 reports), lower back pain (1 subject). Including one 
death, a total of 6 subjects experienced a total of 13 treatment-emergent SAEs, that all were deemed 
unrelated to FACTOR X treatment. In study Ten01 one patient had two AEs of urticaria and one patient 
one AE of allergic dermatitis. But these events were not regarded as product-related AEs (ADRs). Since 
allergic reactions are expected complications of protein-based products, further information and 
analysis of these cases is required. The adverse event reporting mentioned “headache” as a common 
reported treatment-emergent and infusion-associated adverse event. There could be a relation to the 
administration of FACTOR X. 
FACTOR X use was not associated with any clinically significant abnormality in clinical laboratory 
parameters or physical signs. There was no evidence to suggest that FACTOR X induced factor X 
inhibitor. Shifts of thrombogenicity markers were observed in some subjects, but no clinical signs or 
symptoms of thrombosis were observed in any subject. No drug-drug or drug-food interactions were 
reported in the studies. There might be a theoretical interaction or counteraction of Coagadex by factor 
Xa inhibitors such as novel oral anticoagulant drugs.Due to the limited size of the investigated 
population no detailed analyses and predictions could be made for special populations and situations. 
The accidental overdosing of one subject had no apparent sequelae. 
During compassionate use of FACTOR X a miscarriage occurred. A relation to FACTOR X treatment 
appears to be unlikely. 
Evaluation in general follows the currently valid clinical guideline. The presented results are considered 
to be acceptable. No unexpected patterns in the reported adverse events and serious adverse events 
were observed. No safety data in children < 12 years are available. No patients developed Factor X 
inhibitors or thromboembolic events. The presented results are considered to be acceptable.  
JAR 
The overall safety database for Coagadex, 18 individual patients in two clinical trials, is very small but 
taking into account the rarity of the investigated disease with a prevalence of approximately 1: 1 000 
000, considered sufficient to characterize the preauthorisation safety profile. 
The 16 patients enrolled in Ten01 achieved 3 to 111 (median 17.0 days) exposure days per subject. A 
total of 468 infusions were given of which 242 were for treatment of bleeds, 184 as preventative 
treatment, 31 for PK assessments, 6 for surgical procedures and 5 at a batch change. The number of 
infusions of FACTOR X overall ranged from 5 to 115 per subject with a median of 20.0 per subject.  
In the study Ten03 two male subjects received FX for controlling haemostasis during two surgical 
procedures each. All procedures were major: A coronary artery bypass graft, six dental extractions and 
two total knee arthroplasties. Total exposure days in Ten03 were 40, a mean of 10 per surgical 
procedure. The median number of infusions per procedure was 13, mean 10.8 and range 2 to 15.  
The adverse event profile of Coagadex did not reveal any unexpected safety signals. Only a minority of 
AEs were considered as related by the investigator (6/202: 3%): Two subjects (12.5%) in study Ten01 
experienced a total of six events. No SAE was considered related to treatment with FX. From a quality 
point of view, a high rate of aggregates was observed in the final drug product, which could lead to an

increased immunogenicity of Coagadex. However, no patient developed signs of covert inhibitor 
activity or a positive inhibitor assay result in the course of the study.  
An analysis for adverse events of special interest (allergic reactions, thrombotic events, adverse events 
related to bleeding, infections and hepatobiliary events) were submitted to complete the overall safety 
evaluation of Coagadex. No occurences of these AESIs could be identified in the database. 
The use of Coagadex was not associated with any clinically significant abnormality in clinical laboratory 
parameters or physical signs. There was no evidence to suggest that Coagadex induced factor X 
inhibitor. Shifts of thrombogenicity markers were observed in some subjects, but no clinical signs or 
symptoms of thrombosis were observed in any subject. No drug-drug or drug-food interactions were 
reported in the studies. There might be a theoretical interaction or counteraction of Coagadex by factor 
Xa inhibitors such as novel oral anticoagulant drugs. Due to the limited size of the investigated 
population no detailed analyses and predictions could be made for special populations and situations. 
The accidental overdosing of one subject had no apparent sequelae. 
Coagadex is likely to be counteracted by factor Xa inhibitors, direct or indirect. It is recommended that 
these antithrombotic agents should not be used in patients with factor X deficiency. Coagadex should 
not be used as an antidote to the effects of direct oral anti-coagulants (DOACs) in patients who do not 
have factor X deficiency. 
During compassionate use of FACTOR X a miscarriage occurred. A relation to FACTOR X treatment 
appears to be unlikely. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials (back pain, infusion site 
erythema, fatigue and infusion site pain) have been included in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics section 4.8 as common. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Only preliminary safety data in children <12 years are available at this point in time, as the paediatric 
study Ten02 has already started enrolment. An update on the status of the study showed that all 18 
treatment emergent adverse events reported in 5 subjects so far were not considered related to study 
medication. 
No patients developed Factor X inhibitors or thromboembolic events. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Clinical safety data reported in studies Ten01 and Ten03 are considered appropriate to elucidate the 
tolerability and safety of Coagadex for use in hereditary FX deficiency. No unexpected patterns in the 
reported adverse events and serious adverse events were observed. No patients developed Factor X 
inhibitors or thromboembolic events. Preliminary safety data in children <12 years do not raise any 
specific concern for the use of the product. Further safety data in children aged less than 12 years with 
Hereditary Factor X Deficiency will be available from study Ten02 (PIP). All safety information available 
has been included in the SmPC.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, COAGADEX (factor X) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and 
authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
PK profiles covering extensive blood draw time points of nearly 5 half lifes showed that half-life in 
plasma was found to consistently be about 30 hours and incremental recovery about 2 IU/dl/IU/kg, 
translating into  dosing and dose interval recommendations as set in the SmPC. 
In the pivotal study, Ten01, Coagadex was able to satisfactorily treat bleeding events in subjects with 
severe (14) or moderate (2) hereditary factor X deficiency. Of the 187 bleeds evaluated, nearly all 
(98.4%) of the bleeds treated with Coagadex were considered a treatment success (i.e. excellent or 
good response). In addition, the overall efficacy in the three minor surgeries undertaken in this study 
was rated as excellent by investigators. Four major surgeries (two total knee replacements, a cardiac 
bypass operation and an exctraction of 6 pre/molars) undertaken in two subjects (2 procedures each) 
in trial Ten03 demonstrated that blood loss during and after these procedures was less than expected 
or as expected under FX coverage. These results underline that Coagadex acts as a functional blood 
coagulation factor X in the blood of the recipient and is able to correct symptoms of FX deficiency.  
Two patients with recurring bleeding events used routine FX infusions as a long-te rm prophylactic 
treatment although this constituted a protocol deviation. For the use as long-term prophylaxis, 
available data indicate that it was effective in both patients and reduced the bleeding rate meaningfully 
(from 0.23 and 0.82 bleeds/month to 0 for both subjects). Other preventative doses accounted for 56 
(30.4%) infusions which were given as secondary prophylaxis to prevent re-bleeding and 45 (24.5%) 
infusions which were given as a short-term preventative measure (e.g. before increased physical 
activity). In only three cases new bleeding event started withing 24 hours of the preventative infusion, 
of which two were menorrhagic bleeds. This supports the usefulness of FX for short-term prophylaxis. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The final efficacy assessment in surgery is influenced by missing data in major surgery in patients with 
severe factor X deficiency. However it is expected that, if FX levels are raised to 70-90 IU/dl according 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/139881/2016  
Page 84/88 
 
 
 
 
 
to dosing recommendations, the coagulant activity of Coagadex will also provide sufficient protection 
for subjects with severe FX deficiency during major surgical procedures. Furthermore there is no 
evidence to suggest that dosing or monitoring should be different in subjects with severe factor X 
deficiency undergoing major surgical procedures. Including dosing recommendations for all severity 
grades and major procedures will provide appropriate guidance to clinicians caring for these rare 
patients. The applicant has agreed with the FDA to provide data on three additional patients with 
moderate to severe factor X deficiency undergoing major surgical procedures.  
Although the final study report from study Ten02 on PK and clinical data in paediatric patients younger 
than 12 years of age -is outstanding at the moment, preliminary data provide adequate expectation 
that the plasma derived factor X would have comparable effects in children.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Only a small proportion (6/202: 3%) of observed treatment emergent adverse events were assessed 
as related to Coagadex. Related AEs (infusion site reactions, fatigue and back pain) were of mild or 
moderate severity and manageable. The nature and frequency of all AEs reported do not give rise to 
concern and did not reveal unexpected safety signals. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The available safety database of 18 unique subjects is very small but taking into account the rarity of 
the disease it is acceptable. A high and variable percentage of aggregates in the final drug product 
could potentially cause tolerability problems or the formation of inhibitors that were not captured 
during these small trials (see RMP). Information will be collected at post – marketing phase.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In view of the lack of specific therapy, bleeding events in Patients with FX deficiency are currently 
treated with coagulation factor compounds such as FFP or prothrombin complex concentrates. Dosing 
of FX with these products is difficult and the danger of elevating other coagulation factors into the 
supraphysiological range with the consequent potential complications of thrombosis and embolism and, 
due to the large volumes needed, of fluid overload are limiting factors for optimal treatment. 
The favourable effects of a targeted factor X substitution with Coagadex are considered to outweigh 
the observed unfavourable effects, which were generally benign and did not negatively impact the 
patients’ ability and willingness to continue treatment with Coagadex. On the contrary, two patients 
even initiated regular prophylactic infusions once weekly in order to stave off bleeding events. These

favourable effects are expected to apply also to patients younger than 12 years of age, in patients with 
severe or moderate FX deficiency undergoing major surgery and for preventative therapy (long and 
short term prophylaxis of bleeding events). 
From a clinical point of view FX was shown to be a safe and efficacious product with a reproducible 
beneficial effect on the treatment of bleeding events and during surgery. Limited data also support the 
usefulness of FX for short-term or long-term prophylaxis of bleeding events. Furthermore, Coagadex 
will represent the only specific therapy available for patients with hereditary FX deficiency. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The efficacy of Coagadex for the treatment of bleeding episodes and prophylaxis in minor surgery in 
subjects 12 years of age or older is considered established. Data from two patients initiating long-term 
prophylaxis and experiencing a reduction of the annualized bleeding rate to zero underline the 
usefulness of FX for long-term prevention of bleeds. Additionally, the applicant has adequately 
addressed open issues with regard to short-term preventative treatment and major surgery in patients 
with severe deficiency. In support of an extrapolation of the beneficial effects of Coagadex to the 
paediatric population below 12 years of age, the applicant has submitted an update on the paediatric 
trial Ten02, in which 9 children below 12 years of age 12 are enrolled and receive long-term 
prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding events with Coagadex. Preliminary data are consistent with 
those observed in the pivotal trial Ten01, in which 6 adolescents between 12 and 17 years 
participated.  
The safety profile of Coagadex appears to be satisfactory from the data presented so far. Preliminary 
safety data from the paediatric trial Ten02 are also considered favourable. Due to the extreme rarity of 
the disease the safety database is very small even compared to other new medicinal products with an 
orphan designation. Rare events cannot be expected to be captured during the clinical development 
programme; therefore the measures proposed in the RMP will provide additional insights into the 
safety and tolerability of Coagadex once it is available on the market. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus

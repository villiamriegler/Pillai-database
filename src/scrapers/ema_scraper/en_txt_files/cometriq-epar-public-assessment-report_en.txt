2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC) 
Carcinoma of the thyroid is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system and include mostly 
(85%–95%) well-differentiated tumours (papillary or follicular), about 2.5% to 10% of thyroid cancers 
are medullary carcinoma and other are anaplastic, both of which carry a worse prognosis for patients.  
MTC is a distinct subtype, arising from the parafollicular cells (C-cells) of the thyroid, that has 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 7/107 
 
  
  
particular prognostic and genetic features: it presents mainly as a sporadic cancer (75% of cases) or 
as part of a hereditary syndrome (25%). 
- The hereditary form of MTC is a rare disease commonly diagnosed in patients <20 years and 
characterised by Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) with complete penetrance (virtually all patients 
develop MTC), but variable expressivity: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type 2a, MEN type 2b, or 
Familial Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (FMTC). Only 50% of patients with MEN2a and MEN2b, develop 
pheochromocytoma and 30% of patients with MEN2a develop parathyroid hyperplasia.  All of the 
patients with MEN2b develop a typical ganglioneuromastosis throughout the aerodigestive tract.  
Patients with FMTC develop only MTC.  Patients with hereditary MTC carry a germline mutation of the 
‘rearranged during transfection (RET) gene, leading to constitutive activation of the RET tyrosine 
kinase. 
- The sporadic form of MTC most often presents in middle-aged patients as a solitary nodule in the 
thyroid.  RET was found to be mutated in some tumors of patients with sporadic MTC, and patients 
with RET mutations (especially the common M918T mutation) are more likely to have regional lymph 
node involvement or distant metastases and a worse outcome. 
Symptoms and Prognosis 
Patients with MTC often have localization to the neck and mediastinum. Main symptoms are mostly 
diarrhoea, pain, opiod use, fatigue, respiratory symptoms, flushing, weight loss and dysphagia. 
Metastatic MTC spreads most often to the regional lymphatics as well as to the liver, lungs, and bones.  
Metastases can be anticipated by increasing levels of calcitonin and are often evident on radiographic 
imaging studies.   
The 5-year survival for medullary cancer with regional spread is about 78%. For medullary cancer 
which spread to distant sites or lymph node the 5-year survival rate is approximately 40% and median 
overall survival is 2-3 years in patients with distant metastatic disease. Approximately 35% of patients 
present with tumor extending beyond the thyroid with regional lymph node involvement, and 13% 
have metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. Metastatic disease is the most common cause of death in 
patients with MTC, and approximately 90% of patients with metastatic disease die of progressive 
cancer.  
Patients with the hereditary form of the disease generally have a better prognosis than patients with 
the sporadic form.  However, if patients are matched for age and disease stage, no differences in 
survival are seen, suggesting that patients with sporadic disease may be diagnosed later with more 
advanced disease.   
Treatment  
Patients with MTC can be cured by thyroidectomy, performed when the tumour is confined to the 
thyroid gland.  The tumour is relatively unresponsive to conventional doses of radiation therapy and to 
chemotherapeutic regimens. 
Recently, in 2011, vandetanib (Caprelsa), an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) was 
approved for the treatment of aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in patients 
with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.  
For patients in whom Rearranged during Transfection (RET) mutation is not known or is negative, a 
possible lower benefit of treatment with vandetanib should be taken into account.

About the product 
Cometriq is a medicinal product that contains cabozantinib (as malate) as active substance.  
Cabozantinib (also referred to as XL184, EXEL-7184, EXEL-02977184 during the development) is a 
small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in tumour growth and 
angiogenesis, pathologic bone remodeling, and metastatic progression of cancer. Cabozantinib was 
evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases and was identified as an inhibitor of 
MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 
receptors. In addition, cabozantinib inhibits other tyrosine kinases including RET, the GAS6 receptor 
(AXL), the stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3).    
Therapy with Cometriq should be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of 
anticancer medicinal products. The recommended dose of Cometriq is 140 mg once daily, taken as 
one 80 mg orange capsule and three 20 mg grey capsules. Treatment should continue until the 
patient is no longer clinically benefiting from therapy or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. It should be 
expected that a majority of patients treated with Cometriq will require one or more dose adjustments 
(reduction and/or interruption) due to toxicity. Patients should therefore be closely monitored during 
the first eight weeks of therapy (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
The capsules should be swallowed whole and not opened. Patients should be instructed to not eat 
anything for at least 2 hours before through 1 hour after taking Cometriq. 
Cometriq is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1 of the SmPC 
The applicant proposed the following therapeutic indication: Cometriq is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with progressive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid 
carcinoma. 
Following the scientific assessment by CHMP, the therapeutic indication is:  
Cometriq is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable locally 
advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma. 
For patients in whom Rearranged during Transfection (RET) mutation status is not known or is 
negative, a possible lower benefit should be taken into account before individual treatment decision 
(see important information in sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
2.2.  Quality aspects

SmPC. The product is available in blister cards. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 9/107 
 
  
  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The chemical name of cabozantinib (S)-malate is: N-{4-[(6,7-dimethoxyquinolin-4-yl)oxy]phenyl}-N′-
(4-fluorophenyl) cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide, (2S)-hydroxybutanedioate.  
It has the following structural formula: 
Cabozantinib (S)-malate is a white to off-white crystalline substance and is not hygroscopic. It is 
practically insoluble in water above pH 4. Cometriq contains the malate salt of cabozantinib because 
the freebase is insoluble in water. Cabozantinib has a non-chiral molecular structure. Polymorphism 
has been observed for cabozantinib (S)-malate. It is known to exist in two crystalline solid forms (N-1 
and N-2) that have similar properties and one amorphous form. The N-2 form was selected for 
commercial development (see section on pharmaceutical development). 
There is no monograph of cabozantinib in the European Pharmacopoeia. The applicant claimed that 
cabozantinib (S)-malate is a new active substance. The claim is accepted on the basis that 
cabozantinib has not previously been authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union. 
Furthermore, it is confirmed that it is not an isomer, mixture of isomers, a complex or derivative or 
salt of a chemical substance previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union. In 
addition, cabozantinib differs significantly in chemical-pharmaceutical properties and structure from 
vandetanib, a substance that has already been authorised in the EU for a similar indication. 
Manufacture 
Cabozantinib is supplied by one active substance manufacturer. It is synthesised in five main steps 
(with four product isolations), using well defined starting materials. Adequate specifications and 
control methods have been presented for the starting materials, intermediate products and reagents. 
Adequate in-process controls applied during the synthesis. Process validation was conducted on three 
consecutive production-scale batches. Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active 
substance has been provided in the dossier and is considered satisfactory. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using elements of Quality by Design (QbD) such as a 
risk assessment and design of experiment (DOE) studies. Based on these studies, proven acceptable 
ranges (PARS) have been defined for several process parameters for the following steps of the 
manufacturing process of the active substance. The available development data, the proposed control 
strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities, including potentially genotoxic 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 10/107 
 
  
  
 
impurities (GTIs), were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. All potential 
impurities are adequately controlled in steps performed under GMP. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (HPLC, FTIR), assay 
(free base, HPLC), purity (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), water content (KF), malic acid content (HPLC), 
organic volatile impurities (GC), residue on ignition, crystal form (XRPD), particle size distribution and 
heavy metals (Ph.Eur.). The analytical methods used have been adequately described and the non-
compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  Impurities 
(including potentially genotoxic impurities) limits have been adequately justified considering the 
indication and duration of treatment for this life-threatening disease and are considered acceptable 
from a benefit-risk perspective.    
Batch analysis data have been provided on at least eight commercial scale batches produced with the 
proposed commercial process. The results are within the specifications and demonstrate that the 
active ingredient can be manufactured reproducibly. 
Stability 
Five batches of the active substance, cabozantinib (S)-malate, manufactured by the commercial 
process at the intended commercial scale and manufacturing facility were placed on stability under 
long-term and accelerated storage conditions in accordance with ICH Q1A guidelines. The container 
closure system is representative of the intended commercial package. Up to 24 months long term 
stability data (25°C/60%RH) and 6 months accelerated stability data (40°C/75%RH) have been 
provided. The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, impurities including genotoxic 
impurities, water content and crystal form. The validated analytical procedures used in the stability 
testing are the same as those used at release. The assay method by HPLC has been demonstrated to 
be stability indicating. 
A photostability test following ICH guidelines Q1B was performed on one batch. Results of forced 
degradation studies under stress conditions (acid, base, heat, oxidation, UV/visible light) were also 
provided on one batch. The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the 
proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to develop immediate release capsules for oral 
administration that allow dosage adjustments in accordance with the needs of the patient. It was 
decided that this objective could best be met by developing capsules of two strengths, 20 mg and 80 
mg expressed as freebase (more precisely 19.7 mg and 78.9 mg cabozantinib freebase, respectively).    
Cabozantinib is classified as a BCS class II compound (low solubility, high permeability).  
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 11/107 
 
  
  
Based on criteria such as crystallinity, solubility and stability, five salts were selected for further 
evaluation: chloride, maleate, phosphate, L-tartarate, and L-malate. Of these, the malate salt 
exhibited an acceptable combination of crystallinity, solubility, and stability during initial scale up and 
was selected for further development. During the pharmaceutical development it became clear though 
that cabozantinib (S)-malate exists as two closely related crystalline solid forms (N-1 and N-2) that 
have similar properties. An amorphous form has also been identified and characterized. Both 
crystalline forms, N-1 and N-2, have been thoroughly characterized. 
Cometriq contains standard excipients: silicified microcrystalline cellulose (filler) which consists of 
microcrystalline cellulose and silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant), sodium starch 
glycolate (disintegrant), silica colloidal anhydrous (glidant), stearic acid (lubricant). The empty 
gelatine capsule consists of gelatin (capsule matrix), black iron oxide, red iron oxide (colourants), 
titanium dioxide (opacifier) and printing ink. The two strengths comprise the same excipients except 
for the iron oxide colourant. All excipients are pharmacopoeial and generally recognized as safe 
(GRAS) in the proposed concentrations. An excipient compatibility study was conducted and indicated 
that the excipients are compatible with the active substance. The excipient concentrations have been 
optimized by studying the effect of various excipient concentrations on the content of uniformity and 
dissolution. 
An appropriate dissolution method was developed. Parameters such as the dissolution medium pH, 
surfactant type and concentration, dissolution apparatus type and agitation speed were optimized. In 
addition, also the HPLC method was adapted to avoid interference with the surfactant. The final 
dissolution method demonstrated to be able to distinguish between drug product variations. 
During the manufacturing process development, the applicant used design of experiments (DOE) to 
optimise the mixing process parameters. Process robustness studies were executed to identify process 
parameters that are likely to have the greatest impact on product quality and manufacturability and to 
set robust ranges for the manufacturing process parameters. 
The formulation used in the phase 3 clinical studies is identical to the commercial formulation and 
manufactured with a process representative of the final manufacturing process, and at the intended 
commercial scale.  
The primary packaging proposed is PVC/PE/PCTFE/Al blisters. The material complies with the Ph.Eur., 
relevant EMA guidelines and directives and it is adequate to support the stability and use of the 
product. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatin from bovine/limed bone is used in the finished product. Valid TSE certificates of suitability 
(CEP) have been provided for the gelatin suppliers. A valid TSE CEP has also been provided for stearic 
acid. No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
Cometriq hard gelatine capsules are manufactured by a standard manufacturing process, the main 
manufacturing steps are: i) delumping of the active substance and excipients, ii) direct blending of 
components in a diffusion blender, iii) capsule filling and iv) weight sorting. Critical steps have been 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 12/107 
 
  
  
identified and adequate in-process controls are in place. The manufacturing process will be validated 
prior to marketing. An adequate process validation scheme has been provided.  
Proven acceptable ranges have been defined for the main steps of the manufacturing of the finished 
product. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from 
commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. 
Batch analysis data have been provided for 12 commercial scale batches which were manufactured 
with a process representative of the final process. The results demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of reproducibly producing a finished product of the intended quality. Adequate in-
process controls are in place for this pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for appearance (visual), 
identification (HPLC/UV), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), genotoxic impurities (LC/MS),  content 
uniformity (Ph.Eur.), water content (KF), dissolution (HPLC) and microbiological purity (total aerobic 
count and total combined yeast and molds). Impurities (including potentially GTIs) limits have been 
adequately justified considering the indication and duration of treatment for this life-threatening 
disease and are considered acceptable from a benefit-risk perspective.    
Batch analysis results are provided for twelve pilot batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of seven batches of 20 mg capsules and five batches of 80 mg capsules have been 
placed on long term storage conditions (25ºC/60%RH) for up to 24 months, and under accelerated 
conditions (at 40ºC/75%RH) for up to 6 months, according to ICH guidelines. These batches were 
manufactured with a process representative of the final manufacturing process, at the intended 
commercial scale, and form representative batches of the commercial medicinal product. They were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities, water content, dissolution, genotoxic 
impurities and microbial purity. The results are within the specifications and with no significant change 
from the initial data. The analytical procedures used were stability indicating. 
Forced degradation studies were conducted. One development batch of each capsule strength was 
stressed by acid, base, heat, oxidation and light. Samples were analysed for impurities and potency. 
No degradation was observed under acidic and light-stressed conditions. Degradation was observed 
under heat and oxidative conditions, and significant degradation was observed under the basic 
hydrolysis. The degradation profile was similar to that observed for the neat drug substance. 
Photostability was tested for both capsule strengths according to ICH Q1B. No change was seen for 
appearance, potency, impurities GTIs, water content or dissolution. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The proposed control strategy and proposed active 
substance and finished product specifications are considered appropriate to ensure the quality of the 
product. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished 
product and their manufacturing process.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Toxicity associated with oral administration of cabozantinib was characterized in definitive single-dose 
and 2-week and 26-week repeat-dose studies in rats and dogs; a fertility study in rats; 
embryotoxicity/teratogenicity studies in rats and rabbits; in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity bioassays; 
and an in vitro phototoxicity study. Cabozantinib was evaluated in GLP-compliant safety pharmacology 
studies for effects on cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamics studies with cabozantinib consisted of in vitro receptor binding assays and 
of several functional cell-based assays.  In vivo studies focused first on target pharmacodynamic 
effects and tumour cellular responses to treatment. Furthermore multiple murine tumour models were 
used to explore the efficacy of XL184 with regard to tumour growth inhibition and regression in vivo.  
In vitro it was shown that XL184 inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in the nanomolar 
range, including the proto-oncoproteins MET and RET, and the proangiogenesis protein VEGFR2. 
Additional targets of XL184 are FLT-3, TIE-2, AXL, TRKB, and KIT. XL184 also inhibits several mutants

Page 14/107 
 
  
  
forms of RET, MET and KIT, including the activated isoform RET M918T, a very common mutation in 
medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). XL184 was found to be an active site inhibitor that is competitive 
with ATP for each target tested (MET, VEGFR2, FLT3, TIE-2). Of all these targets only one RTK has 
been implicated in MTC, ie the RET tyrosine kinase. 
The most important metabolites in humans are XL184 desmethyl sulphate (M2a or EXEL1644) and 
XL184 monohydroxy sulphate (M4). It appears that the pharmacological activity of 1644 is limited 
(>50% residual control activity at a concentration of 1 µM). However, human Cmax is above the 
tested concentration and human exposure is relative extensive. Based on the higher protein binding of 
the metabolite than the parent compound (99.950 to 99.996% against 99.7 to >99%) it appears 
likely that this metabolite does not significantly contribute of the pharmacological activity of the 
current product. No data on in vitro substrate/inhibition of the various Cyps have been provided for 
this metabolite because in vitro and in vivo data suggested that cabozantinib has minimal to no 
clinically-relevant CYP induction potential.  
Metabolite M4 (EXEL-1646) has broader and more potent inhibition of several kinases, when compared 
to 1644.  However, the inhibition of 48 kinases were compared between M4 and the parent 
cabozantinib and cabozantinib parent showed a much greater potency over a broader range of kinases 
than did M4. Therefore, this shows that EXEL-1646 does not contribute substantial to the 
cabozantinib’s PD activity. The activity of two other major metabolites of XL184, M1 and M8 were 
found to be less active against the primary targets of XL184 (MET, VEGFR2) and both can be 
considered not to have a significant contribution to the pharmacologically activity of XL184. 
Also in cellular systems exposure to XL184 inhibited basal or growth factor-induced auto-
phosphorylation of RTKs, proliferation of tumour cell lines (including only one cell line relevant for the 
current indication, ie TT medullary thyroid tumour cell line containing a RET mutation, Ret C634W), 
microvascular endothelial cell migration, and VEGF-driven tube formation. These data indicate that 
XL184 may have an anti-tumour effect in vivo on tumours that depend on signalling via one of several 
RTKs RET/MET/VEGFR/… for growth and/or migration/metastasis formation. In these studies only 
limited attention has been paid to the RET tyrosine kinase and its clinically relevant mutations. In vitro 
inhibition generally is seen in the nM range. Extrapolation of these concentrations to in vivo situation 
is not always possible due to the extremely high protein binding of XL184 (>99.9%). However it is 
noted that human plasma concentrations are in the low µM range suggesting that the free plasma 
concentrations may be within the pharmacological active range.  
The relationship between dosing, plasma concentration and target RTK inhibition was studied in 
several studies in nude athymic mice tumour models. Prolonged inhibition of several RTKs was noted 
which corresponded to the plasma concentrations of XL184 in that inhibition was diminished when 
plasma levels fell below approximately 10 μM  (5 µg/ml) for MET, 15 μM for RET (7,5 µg/ml), and 5 
μM (2,5 µg/ml) for VEGFR2. This is within the range or slightly above the clinical plasma levels (2-4 
µM). In the target tissue the concentrations of XL184 behaved in a similar manner to plasma 
concentrations. The concentration in lung was similar (study XL184-disc-010) or ~ 2 fold higher 
(study XL184-disc-015) to plasma, the concentration in tumour was the similar to (study XL184-disc-
011) or ~ 2-fold lower (study XL184-disc-009 and disc-014) than plasma concentration. In liver the 
concentration was ~2-3 fold higher than in plasma (study XL184-disc-013). 
Data from several rat or murine tumour models indicate that once daily administration of XL184 can 
inhibit tumour growth, and even tumour regression at high doses when plasma levels are in low µM

range. Histopathology of tumour tissue revealed reduced cellular proliferation and microvessel density 
and increased necrosis in XL184 treated animals. Also relatively large sized tumours were sensitive to 
XL184 treatment. No data is available on regrowth of tumour following multiple dosing, it is assumed 
that tumours regrow following end of treatment, however it is not clear if there may be a rebound 
effect (increased tumour growth) following end of treatment. In only one study a tumour cell line 
relevant for the indication was used (TT). In this xenograft model (study XL184-disc-025) clear 
tumour growth inhibition was shown, but regression was only seen at the highest dose.  
The effect of XL184 treatment on metastasis formation was evaluated in several studies.  In most, but 
not all studies inhibition of metastasis formation was noted. No MTC cell line was used on these 
studies.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were performed.  
In a screen consisting of 75 pharmacological targets, including receptors, transporters, and enzymes, 
specific inhibition was seen only for the adenosine A3 receptor (IC50 <0.9 µM) and the ML1 
(melatonin) receptor (IC50> 1 µM). These potential interactions do not represent a toxicologically or 
clinically significant risk.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
In in vivo safety pharmacology studies, no adverse effects on neurobehavioral function at up to 300 
mg/kg or respiratory-system function at up to 900 mg/kg occurred in rats administered XL184. 
The in vitro safety pharmacology data were not performed according to GLP, and data provided in 
several study reports was limited. The data suggest that cabozantinib is not a potent hERG inhibitor, 
but has an effect on hERG trafficking, which might lead to delayed QT prolongation in patients. In vivo 
in dogs, no effects on ECG parameters were observed after a single dose, nor after 26 weeks of dosing 
(see repeated dose toxicity). In patients, detailed evaluation of the effect of cabozantinib on QT 
interval was performed in a clinical trial, which revealed a slight, but not clinically relevant 
prolongation of the QT interval. Considering the available clinical data and the lack of a relevant effect 
on ECG parameters, further non-clinical data or discussion are not required. In vivo, no effect other 
than a transient effect on diastolic blood pressure was seen. Hypertension is a known class effect of 
these type of products and this has also been observed in clinical trials. Further monitoring on a 
clinical level is warranted.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  performed  (see  discussion  on  Non-clinical 
aspects).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Cabozantinib is a highly permeable compound with a generally rapid absorption after oral 
administration. Absolute bioavailability of the malate salt of cabozantinib administered via an oral 
capsule (clinical formulation) is moderate to high in dog and rat, respectively.  
Kinetics of cabozantinib after repeated once-daily dosing were generally linear in rats over the dose 
range 0.1 – 15 mg/kg, but increased more than dose-proportional over the dose range 5 – 15 mg/kg. 
In dogs, cabozantinib exposure increased less than linearly with dose over the dose range 0.2 – 5 
mg/kg but more than linear with dose over the range 10 – 100 mg/kg. 
Cabozantinib is highly bound to plasma proteins in all pre-clinical species and in humans (>99.7%) 
and widely distributed into body tissues, including passage over the blood-brain barrier, the blood-
testes barrier and the placenta, as expected based on the moderate to high volume of distribution. In 
addition, cabozantinib has potential to bind to melanin. Partitioning into red blood cells has not been 
studied pre-clinically but data provided in the clinical section showed that XL184 is mainly present in 
plasma and to a limited extent distributed into erythrocytes. Elimination from plasma is slower in rat 
than in the other pre-clinical species as indicated by lower plasma clearance values. In addition, 
excretion data in rat show that within 24 hours only about a third was excreted. Cabozantinib is 
mainly excreted via faeces in rats.  
Entero-hepatic recirculation of cabozantinib may occur in humans as well as in rats and dogs. 
However, based on the chemical structures of the metabolites readily enabling back-transformation to 
parent cabozantinib is not expected. For the glucuronide conjugates however back transformation is 
possible by the intestinal flora. At this stage, it is unclear whether drug-drug interactions with 
antibiotics or disruption of the enterohepatic recirculation of cabozantinib by other drugs, such as 
cholestagel or cholestyramine, could occur. Further studies are being conducted to clarify this (see 
Discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Hepatic clearance does not play a large role in the elimination of cabozantinib in the pre-clinical 
species as cabozantinib has a low intrinsic clearance value and in vivo only approximately a tenth in 
rat and a third in mouse is metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a much lesser extent CYP2C9. However, not 
all CYPs are studied for involvement in the formation of these metabolites (except for M1). In addition, 
no data on enzyme involvement are available for the other metabolites. In humans however, 
metabolism is more prominent than in the pre-clinical species. The major component in plasma is 
unchanged parent and exposure to XL184-monohydroxysulfate (M4), the main human metabolite, was 
25% relative to total plasma exposure. No data were provided on the metabolite profile of the excreta 
(see Discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Cabozantinib is an inhibitor, but not a substrate, of P-glycoprotein with an IC50 value of 0.5 μM. The 
Applicant will perform a study investigating whether cabozantinib is a substrate or inhibitor of MRD1, 
BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, ACT1, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in 2Q13. Potential 
inhibitory effects on MATE1 and MATE2k also will be addressed. Evaluation of CYP2B6 inhibition by 
cabozantinib showed a concentration dependent inhibition over the range 0.41 to 16 µM with an IC50 
value of 10.1 µM. As this IC50 value is higher than the IC50 value for CYP2C8 and a clinical drug-drug 
interaction study did not show inhibitory effects of cabozantinib on CYP2C8 in vivo, it is not expected 
that cabozantinib will inhibit CYP2B6 in vivo. Cabozantinib is not expected to inhibit or induce CYPs in 
humans at clinically relevant concentrations.

In rats the most important target tissues for cabozantinib-related toxicity after 2 weeks of oral gavage 
are GI tract, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, reproductive tract tissues, endocrine tissues, liver and 
kidney. The adverse effects were generally dose related and seen from 5 mg/kg/day and above and 
were generally reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. At the maximum dose of 1 mg/kg/day 
during the 6 month study, mild and mostly reversible effects were seen on liver and kidney. Because 
one animal died possibly test article-related, the NOAEL was considered 0.3 mg/kg/day, which is

agreed. Based on the AUC of plasma exposures this is 0.2- to 0.3-fold of the intended clinical 
exposure. 
At high dose (≥100 mg/kg for 4-14 days), cabozantinib causes hematopoietic- and hepatotoxicity, 
and dehydration in dogs. Also targets for toxicity are GI-tract, lymphoid tissues, testes, bone, 
pancreas, gallbladder, eye and possibly CNS tissues. Lesions were reversible at 100 mg/kg. No 
treatment-related histopathologic changes were present at 10 mg/kg for 14 days. At the maximum 
dose of 5 mg/kg/day during the 6 month study, no signs of toxicity were evident, but some effects 
occurred in reproductive tissues. An extra chronic study with 20 mg/kg showed some reversible 
hematopoietic- and hepatotoxicity, and effects on skin. The histological appearance of testes, 
epididymis, ovaries, mammary glands, and uterus was similar to animals that have not attained 
complete sexual maturity, which was not the case in the control animals. The NOAEL was considered 
to be 5 mg/kg, which is about 0.2-fold of the intended clinical exposure. 
Moderate to severe hypopigmentation was observed in a 6-month repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs 
(XL184-NC-018), at exposure levels below expected human exposure level, leading to discoloured skin 
and hair, resembling vitiligo in humans. Rat distribution studies have demonstrated that XL184-related 
radioactivity is retained and accumulated in pigmented ocular tissue. Due to the use of non-pigmented 
animals in the long-term repeat-dose rat study, similar findings in pigmented rats cannot be excluded.  
Although cabozantinib appears to accumulate and retain in ocular tissue, the skin and hair 
depigmentation observed with cabozantinib is most likely related to inhibition of c-KIT, and is not 
considered a concern for the pigmentation of the eye.

Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity evaluations of XL184 have not been conducted based on the absence of genotoxicity in 
both in vitro and in vivo bioassays, the lack of preneoplastic lesions in chronic repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats and dogs, the lack of demonstrated carcinogenic potential in the RTKi product class, 
and the intended treatment population of subjects with advanced, progressive MTC with limited 
treatment options and a relatively short life expectancy (which is supported by the interim overall 
survival results from the pivotal study XL184-301), in accordance with ICH S1A and ICH S9. 
Reproductive Toxicity 
Cabozantinib-related effects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in rats, leading to 
reduced fertility at ≥1 mg/kg/day for females and ≥2.5 mg/kg/day for males. Paternal toxicity showed 
from  2.5 mg/kg/day (death, pale ears, thin appearance, missing teeth, extremely white, excessively 
long, malocclusion, cut or curved upward; hair coat yellow, red or rough in appearance, and fecal 
changes). Comparable toxicity showed in females also from 2.5 mg/kg, but less severe. Weights of 
testes, epididymis, prostate and seminal vesicles decreased and reductions occurred in sperm count 
and concentration from 2.5 mg/kg. No fertile males were present at 2.5 and above. A dose-related 
prolongation of diestrus showed at 2.5 mg/kg. Although the majority of females had confirmed 
matings, the male/female fertility index was 0% at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg; there were no pregnancies in 
either group. Female fertility and embryo/fetal viability were reduced at 1 mg/kg. Effects are below or 
around the intended human exposure. 
In line with these findings, histopathological findings were observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
dogs (reduced testes weight and hypospermatogenensis at > 1 mg/kg/day; reduced ovary weight at 
≥0.2 mg/kg/day). At present, the reversibility of the effects on male and female fertility is not known. 
Consequently, the need for advice regarding fertility preservation measures is stated in the SPC 
section 4.6. 
In rats, maternal toxicity showed at 5 mg/kg cabozantinib. Embryo/fetal viability and development 
were adversely affected at ≥ 0.6 mg/kg. Based on a treatment-related increase in post-implantation 
loss at ≥0.03 mg/kg/day, the NOEL for embryo/fetal viability was determined to be 0.01 mg/kg/day, 
which is <1% than the human exposure.  
In rabbits, the NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryo-fetal viability and growth was 3 mg/kg. The 
NOEL for teratology was 1.0 mg/kg, equating to a plasma exposure <0.1-fold of the intended human 
dose.  
Malformations were not observed in the decisive embryo-foetal study in rats dosed up to 0.1 
mg/kg/day. However, edema, cleft palate/lip, dermal aplasia and kinked/rudimentary tail were 
observed in the dose-range study at 0.6 mg/kg/day, without maternal toxicity. In rabbits, 
cabozantinib-related foetal visceral variations / malformations occurred at 3 mg/kg/day in the decisive 
study, reflected by small or missing intermediate lobe of lungs, reduced spleens (7 foetuses in one 
litter), and a significant increase in the foetal incidence of total malformations, albeit at a maternally 
toxic dose.

Juvenile toxicity 
Juvenile animals were dosed at PND 21-70. Major, reversible findings  following treatment from 
PND21-35 (cohort 1) were limited to increased WBC parameters, decreased haematopoiesis, 
pubescent/immature female reproductive system (without delayed vaginal opening), and reduced

bone mineral content and density. Major findings following treatment from PND21-70 (cohort 2) were 
increased WBC parameters, increased haematopoiesis, tooth abnormalities, reduced bone mineral 
density and content, liver pigmentation and bile duct hyperplasia. The observed effects on 
uterus/ovaries and decreased haematopoiesis seen in cohort 1 were not seen in cohort 2, suggesting 
transient effects, while effects on bone parameters and liver pigmentation were sustained. Findings 
from the juvenile toxicity study have been included in the SPC section 5.3.

Interspecies comparison 
There are some differences in oral bioavailability of the L-malate salt between the pre-clinical species 
investigated: ~90% in rats and ~55% in dogs. No absolute bioavailability was determined for 
humans. 
Volume of distribution was comparable across mouse and rat (i.e. ~0.9 and ~0.6 L/kg, respectively) 
but was significantly lower than in dog and monkey (i.e. ~2.1 and ~2.7 L/kg). Further, plasma 
clearance was approximately one order of magnitude lower in rat (i.e. ~0.030 – 0.045 L/kg/hr) than 
in the other pre-clinical species (i.e. 0.23 – 0.64 L/kg/hr). In line with this, plasma half-lives were also 
comparable between mouse, dog and monkey (i.e. ~3 – 4 hours) and longer in rat (i.e. ~12 – 13 
hours). In humans, elimination of XL184 was much slower than in the pre-clinical species. The volume 
of distribution (Vc/F) was much larger in humans than in the pre-clinical species, i.e. ~5.8 L/kg. The 
clearance (CL/F) was in the same order of magnitude as in rats (0.07 L/kg/hr), but plasma half-life 
was much longer with 120 hours.  
Plasma protein binding of XL184 was high in all species, including humans.  
Metabolism of XL184 is more prominent in humans than in the pre-clinical species. However, no 
unique human metabolites were found. Furthermore, XL184 is mainly excreted via faeces in both rats 
and humans but urine is a more important route of excretion in humans than in rats. Further 
comparison of metabolism and excretion across pre-clinical species and humans is hampered by 
several facts: 1) in vivo metabolism of XL184 in the different species is elucidated at different dosages 
and dosing regiments; 2) the excretion of XL184 has not been investigated in dog, which is considered 
as a key animal species for preclinical assessment; 3) the excretion of XL184 in bile has not been

investigated while the presence of entero-hepatic recirculation is assumed in humans; 4) the 
metabolite profile of the excreta has not been determined.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant has submitted an ERA based on the EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 guideline (EMEA, 2006).  
The Applicant refined the Fpen based on the prevalence of medullary thyroid cancer. This refinement 
resulted in an Fpen of 0.00007 and a PECsw of 0.0049 µg/L. Since this value is lower than the action 
limit of 0.01 µg/L, no unacceptable adverse effects to the environment are expected. No further 
environmental risk assessment is required.

Based  on  the  refined  PECsw,  no  unacceptable  risk  for  the  environment  is  expected  from 
cabozantinib.  However,  the  determination  of  the  log  Kow  according  to  OECD  guidelines.  (including 
reports) should be submitted post-authorisation (see Discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Cabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in 
tumour growth and angiogenesis, pathologic bone remodeling, and metastatic progression of cancer. 
Cabozantinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases and was identified as 
an inhibitor of MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth 
factor) receptors. In addition, cabozantinib inhibits other tyrosine kinases including RET, the GAS6 
receptor (AXL), the stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3).    
Cabozantinib exhibited dose-related tumour growth inhibition, tumor regression, and/or inhibited 
metastasis in a broad range of preclinical tumour models. A clear anti-tumour effect of XL184 is 
evident from the primary pharmacodynamic studies. XL184 clearly potently inhibited RET in vitro, a 
RTK that is implicated in MTC,  and had an anti-tumour effect in vivo against RET mutated MTC cell 
lines. Dysregulation of MET signalling has been observed in many tumour types, but thus far not in 
MTC. So while MET inhibition may, in theory be beneficial for MTC patients, no solid evidence has been 
provided. In principle inhibition of VEGFR may also add to an anti-tumour effect of XL184 in MTC 
patients, however data to substantiate this claim are not available. Thus, while inhibition of several 
signalling pathways may be potential targets for MTC treatment, for only one RTK, RET, a clear 
association with MTC has been proven. Since XL184 clearly inhibits this RTK, in vitro and has an 
antitumour effect in vivo against RET mutated MTC cell lines proof of principle for XL184 treatment in 
MTC patients is considered to be provided. 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed. It is agreed that co-medication with 
products having the same pharmacological targets is unlikely. Therefore the absence of 
pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies is agreed. 
The bioavailability of cabozantinib is moderate to high, and it is highly bound to plasma proteins. 
There are four major metabolites, of which the 6-desmethyl half-dimer sulphate (M2a) and the 
monohydroxysulphate (M4) are the most important. In rats Cabozantinib is mainly excreted via 
faeces. Cabozantinib is an inhibitor, but not a substrate, of P-glycoprotein with an IC50 value of 0.5 
μM. No other transporters were investigated. Cabozantinib is not expected to inhibit or induce CYPs in 
humans at clinically relevant concentrations.  
Excretion data should have been provided for dogs as these data are important for the assessment of 
possible toxicity and interspecies comparison. The Applicant will provide information on the excretion 
of XL184/radioactivity in dog post-approval. Also, the Applicant is requested to provide metabolite 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 27/107 
 
  
  
 
 
 
profiling data of the excreta for rats and dogs. In light of the presumed enterohepatic recirculation, 
the Applicant is currently performing excretion experiments in bile duct-cannulated and non-
cannulated rats and dogs. The evaluation of enterohepatic recirculation evaluation in dogs and rats is 
included in the RMP.  Based on the outcome of these non-clinical studies, the CHMP recommended the 
applicant to consider drug interaction studies with the antibiotic neomycin, or with drugs that may 
disrupt the enterohepatic recirculation of cabozantinib, such as cholestagel or cholestyramine.  
It is unknown whether cabozantinib is excreted in milk of lactating animals. It is not known whether 
cabozantinib and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential harm to the 
infant, mothers should discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with cabozantinib, and for at least 
4 months after completing therapy (see SmPC section 4.6). 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: In rat and dog 
repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 months duration, target organs for toxicity were GI tract, bone 
marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adrenal and reproductive tract tissues. The no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) for these findings were below human clinical exposure levels at intended 
therapeutic dose (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Cabozantinib has shown no mutagenic or clastogenic potential in a standard battery of genotoxicity 
assays. Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed (see SmPC section 5.3). The lack of 
carcinogenicity studies is considered acceptable in this setting consistent with on ICH guidelines S1A 
and S9, in view of the absence of genotoxicity in both in vitro and in vivo bioassays, the lack of 
preneoplastic lesions in chronic repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, the lack of demonstrated 
carcinogenic potential in the RTKi product class, and the intended treatment population of subjects 
with advanced, progressive medullary thyroid cancer with limited treatment options and a relatively 
short life expectancy.  
Fertility studies in rats have shown reduced male and female fertility. Further, hypospermatogenesis 
was observed in male dogs at exposure levels below human clinical exposure levels at intended 
therapeutic dose (see SmPC section 5.3).  
There are no data on human fertility. Both men and women should be advised to seek advice and 
consider fertility preservation before treatment (see SmPC sedction 4.6). 
Embryo-foetal development studies were performed in rats and rabbits. In rats, cabozantinib caused 
postimplantation loss, foetal edema, cleft palate/lip, dermal aplasia and kinked or rudimentary tail. In 
rabbits,  cabozantinib produced foetal soft tissue changes (reduced spleen size, small or missing 
intermediate lung lobe) and increased foetal incidence of total malformations. NOAEL for embryo-
foetal toxicity and teratogenic findings were below human clinical exposure levels at intended 
therapeutic dose (see SmPC section 5.3).  There are no studies in pregnant women using 
cabozantinib. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Cabozantinib should not be used during 
pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with cabozantinib (see SmPC 
sections 4.6). 
Women of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on cabozantinib. Female 
partners of male patients taking cabozantinib must also avoid pregnancy. Effective methods of 
contraception should be used by male and female patients and their partners during therapy, and for 
at least 4 months after completing therapy. Because oral contraceptives might possibly not be 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 28/107 
 
  
  
considered as “effective methods of contraception,” they should be used together with another 
method, such as a barrier method (see SmPC sections 4.6 and 4.5 and Discussion on clinical 
pharmacology). 
Juvenile rats (comparable to a >2 year old pediatric population) administered cabozantinib showed 
increased WBC parameters, decreased haematopoiesis, pubescent/immature female reproductive 
system (without delayed vaginal opening), tooth abnormalities, reduced bone mineral content and 
density, liver pigmentation and bile duct hyperplasia. Findings in uterus/ovaries and decreased 
haematopoiesis appeared to be transient, while effects on bone parameters and liver pigmentation 
were sustained. Evaluations in juvenile rats (comparable to a <2 year old pediatric population) have 
not been performed (see SmPC section 5.3).  
A pre-and postnatal development study of cabozantinib in rats is planned, and is scheduled to initiate 
dosing in 3Q13. This is covered in the RMP. 
In order to evaluate potential effect in a paediatric population below 2 years of age, a further study 
with dosing from PND12 is planned, and will be submitted when finalised. This is included in the RMP. 
In accordance with ICH S9, evaluation of metabolites is generally not warranted in patients with 
advanced cancer. However, metabolites M1, M2a (EXEL 1644), M4 and M8 are in much higher 
concentrations in humans than in the used animal models, especially M2a and M4 (about 39% and 
13% of the total amount respectively). M1 and M8 are of low abundance in humans and are not 
expected to be genotoxic (M1 is not mutagenic in Ames test and M8 has no structural alert). M4 shows 
little pharmacodynamic activity and is not mutagenic in the Ames test. According to ICH S9 it is not 
necessary to test metabolites M1, M4 and M8 further for toxicity.  
Metabolite EXEL 1644, which is of high abundance in humans, was not tested in animals. This 
metabolite was negative in the Ames test. In order to address the safety aspects of metabolite EXEL 
1644, the applicant will perform  a GLP-compliant 2-week toxicity study. This study is included in the 
RMP. 
The applicant qualified the impurity ortho-fluoro cabozantinib in a 2 week rat study. It is not expected 
that ortho-fluoro cabozantinib will influence the safety of the product.  
Potential genotoxic impurities in XL184 drug substance were identified and found positive in the Ames 
test. The specifications of the genotoxic impurities in the product are slightly higher than the threshold 
of toxicologic concern (TTC) value of 1.5 μg/day. However, it is agreed that specifications higher than 
the TTC may be acceptable under certain conditions, e.g. short-term exposure, for treatment of a life-
threatening condition, or when life expectancy is less than 5 years (Guideline on the limits of genotox 
impurities), which is the case. 
Based on the refined PECsw, no unacceptable risk for the environment is expected from cabozantinib. 
However, the CHMP recommended that the applicant should determine the log Kow according to OECD 
guidelines.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Following a single oral dose, cabozantinib was absorbed with maximum plasma concentrations of 
cabozantinib achieved at median time of 2 to 5 hours post-dose across studies in healthy volunteers 
and cancer patients. Multiple peaks in the plasma concentration–time profile following a single oral 
dose suggest that cabozantinib is enterohepatically recirculated. 
The absolute bioavailability of cabozantinib has not been determined. Based on the provided mass 
balance study, however, at least 27% of the administered cabozantinib is renally excreted, and thus at 
least this fraction of the administered dose was absorbed. 
In current practice, the capsules contain mainly the N2 crystal form of cabozantinib. Based on the 
outcome of the provided bioequivalence study XL184-016, no relevant difference in bioavailability is to 
be expected in case different crystal forms, i.e., N1 or N2 are present. 
A high-fat meal moderately increased cabozantinib C max and AUC values by 41% and 57%, 
respectively, relative to fasted conditions in healthy volunteers. Based on this food-effect study, the 
Applicant decided to administer cabozantinib under fasted conditions, i.e., the patients are instructed 
not to eat for at least 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking cabozantinib. This posology was applied 
in all clinical studies. 
Distribution 
Cabozantinib was highly plasma protein bound at all concentration levels tested; the percentage 
bound was >99.9% for both the 0.2 and 1.0 μM levels, and 99.7% at 10 μM level. Cabozantinib does 
not extensively bind to erythrocytes. The popPK estimated volume of the central compartment (Vc/F) 
was approximately 350 l.  
Metabolism 
The following metabolites of cabozantinib were characterised in plasma: XL184-N-oxide, XL184-
monohydroxysulphate, XL184 half dimer, half-dimer methyl ester, 6-demethyl half-dimer sulphate, 7-
demethyl half-dimer sulphate, demethyl XL184 glucuronide A and B. The 6-demethyl half-dimer 
sulfate metabolite is the main circulating metabolite, and more abundant than cabozantinib in plasma. 
Based on LC-MS/MS analysis, mean exposure ratios for cabozantinib and metabolites XL184-half-
dimer, XL184-N-oxide, XL184-sulfate and 6-demethyl half-dimer sulfate relative to total exposure 
(AUC0-t (each analyte)/AUC0-t (parent + 4 metabolites)) were 32.4%, 3.09%, 4.90%, 13.8% and 
45.9%, respectively. The t1/2 of the major 6-demethyl half-dimer sulfate metabolite could not be 
determined, but is much longer than that of cabozantinib and the other characterised metabolites. In 
vitro data indicate that the formation of the XL184-N-oxide metabolite is dependent on CYP3A4, and 
to a lesser extent on CYP2C9. Formation of a number of other metabolites seems to be dependent on 
CYP3A4 as well, although only a limited number of CYPs were tested. It appears that non-conjugated 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 31/107 
 
  
  
metabolites are present only at low levels, and are less active than cabozantinib (see Discussion on 
Clinical pharmacology).  
Elimination 
The plasma terminal half-life of cabozantinib in single dose studies was approximately 120 hours. 
Cabozantinib is eliminated both via the hepatic (at least 54% of the administered dose) and renal 
route (at least 27%). Cabozantinib is not directly excreted in urine, but is present to some extent in 
faeces. Both in urine and faeces, multiple metabolites are detected, with dequinolinyl XL184 
glucuronide, dequinolinyl XL184 sulfate, and XL184 half dimer being the main metabolites in urine, 
while cabozantinib, M11 (minor metabolite, not identified), demethyl XL184, and XL184 oxidation B 
were the main metabolites in faeces. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportional cabozantinib pharmacokinetics was demonstrated for the powder-in-bottle 
suspension formulation up to a dose of approximately 1000 mg. For the capsule formulation dose-
proportionality was assessed less extensively. In cancer patients, comparable –and thus not dose-
proportional- exposures were observed for a 175 and 250 mg cabozantinib malate capsule dose, both 
after a single dose and under steady-state conditions. This may point at limited absorption at this 
dose, potentially caused by limited solubility of cabozantinib. At lower doses in healthy volunteers, the 
dose-normalised exposure upon administration of 100 mg or 175 mg cabozantinib malate (78 mg and 
138 mg cabozantinib freebase, respectively) appears comparable, indicating dose-proportional 
behaviour between these two doses.  
Accumulation of cabozantinib upon multiple dosing (AUC and Cmax increase 4.6 and 3.9-fold, 
respectively) is reasonably in line with expected, based on a t1/2 of approximately 120 hours. Steady 
state appears to be reached after 15 days of OD dosing. No major differences are apparent in 
cabozantinib PK between healthy volunteers and cancer patients, with Cmax, AUC and t max, as well as 
interindividual variability being comparable.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment.  
Cabozantinib  pharmacokinetics  has  not  been  investigated  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  (see 
Discussion on clinical pharmacology).  
Hepatic impairment.  
The  PK  of  cabozantinib  in  hepatically  impaired  subjects  is  being  evaluated  in  an  ongoing  dedicated 
study (see Discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Gender, weight, race and age.  
Based on population PK studies there appears to be a difference in exposure between males and 
females, which is not expected to be clinically relevant. In the population PK analysis, there was no 
clear relationship between cabozantinib clearance and weight in the 40-135 kg range.  
No data are available on the effect of race on cabozantinib pharmacokinetics.  
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 32/107 
 
  
  
The population PK analysis indicated that age did not affect cabozantinib PK to a clinically relevant 
extent. Cabozantinib has not yet been investigated in the paediatric population. The lack of data in the 
population <18 years is indicated in the SPC. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effect other drugs on cabozantinib pharmacokinetics.  
Cabozantinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9.  
Administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days) to healthy 
volunteers decreased cabozantinib clearance (by 29%) and increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib 
exposure (AUC) by 38%. Administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg daily for 
31 days) to healthy volunteers increased cabozantinib clearance (4.3-fold) and decreased single-dose 
plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC) by 77% (see Discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
The solubility of cabozantinib is pH dependent, with very low solubility observed at a pH >3. 
Therefore, absorption of cabozantinib may be reduced in patients taking gastric pH modifying agents 
like proton pump inhibitors of H2 antagonists (see Discussion on clinical pharmacology).  
Effect cabozantinib on PK of other drugs.  
Based on the in vitro inhibition assays, cabozantinib is not expected to inhibit CYPs in vivo to a 
significant extent. Cabozantinib did not significantly inhibit CYP2C8 in vivo in a rosiglitazone drug-drug 
interaction study. 
With respect to induction by cabozantinib, no in vivo induction of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 is suggested by in vitro studies.  
Cabozantinib was an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transport 
activities in a bi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may have 
the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. Subjects should 
be cautioned regarding taking a P-gp substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, dabigatran 
etexilate, digoxin, colchicine, maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, talinolol, 
tolvaptan) while receiving cabozantinib (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Cabozantinib has not been evaluated for possible interactions (as inhibitor) with other transporter 
pathways than P-gp (see Discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
No pharmacokinetic studies using human biomaterials were submitted. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Cabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in 
tumour growth and angiogenesis, pathologic bone remodelling, and metastatic progression of cancer. 
Cabozantinib was evaluated in non-clinical studies for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases 
and was identified as an inhibitor of MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and VEGF 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 33/107 
 
  
  
(vascular endothelial growth factor) receptors, as well as other tyrosine kinases including RET (glial 
cell derived neurotrophic factor receptor rearranged during transfection), AXL (GAS6 receptor), KIT 
(stem cell factor receptor), and FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3). 
Primary pharmacology 
Plasma markers of angiogenic pathways have been evaluated in previous clinical studies of anti-
VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, e.g. for sunitinib. The common finding from trials of small molecule 
anti-VEGFR2 agents is an increase in the circulating levels of VEGF and PlGF, and a decrease in the 
level of soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2) upon treatment. Therefore, in the Phase 1 dose finding Study 
XL184-001, these three plasma markers were investigated. 
In addition to these three VEGFR2 pathway biomarkers, two additional plasma proteins were assessed 
on an exploratory basis in Study XL184-001. Soluble MET (sMET) was chosen due to the possible 
effects of MET or VEGFR2 inhibition on regulation of the MET receptor, and erythropoietin (EPO) was 
evaluated, as levels of EPO have been shown increase as a consequence of VEGF pathway inhibition in 
preclinical models ascribed to an upregulation of hepatic erythropoietin expression.  
In the pivotal phase 3 study of cabozantinib XL184-301, changes in soluble KIT receptor (sKIT) were 
evaluated as a biomarker of KIT pathway inhibition as well. 
In Study XL184-001, the change in plasma levels for VEGF, sVEGFR2, PlGF, EPO, and sMET were 
monitored. Three of the markers (sVEGFR2, PlGF, EPO) demonstrated statistically significant changes 
upon treatment when Day 29 pre-dose levels (175 mg daily cohort only) when compared to pre-
treatment levels (Table 11). 
Assessment report

Table  11.  Summary  of  change  in  plasma  biomarkers  between  day  1  and  day  29  after  O.D. 
treatment with 175 mg cabozantinib as capsule formulation (Study XL184-001) 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
In Study XL184-001, to understand whether there is a concentration dependency in the 
exposure/response relationship for XL184 plasma exposure and the biomarkers, the plasma levels for 
VEGF, sVEGFR2, PlGF, EPO, and sMET were plotted against the concurrent plasma concentration, the 
calculated plasma Cmax, and the average plasma concentration (Cave) of XL184. No statistically 
significant relationship exists between the Cmax values of XL184 and the plasma biomarker 
concentrations (data not shown). Use of Cave instead of XL184 concentrations led to a weaker 
relationship between exposure and response; only PlGF and sVEGFR2 maintained statistical 
significance. While there was clear evidence for a concentration dependence of the effect of XL184 on 
the four plasma biomarkers described above, the slopes of the effect curves were relatively flat, 
indicating that this pharmacodynamic effect is not highly dependent upon concurrent XL184 
concentration and that the effect is measurable over a broad range of concentrations. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
RET mutations were investigated in Study XL184-301. DNA samples derived from blood and tumour 
tissue were analysed for alterations in the sequence of the gene encoding RET; subjects with a 
documented RET mutation were not required to provide a tumour sample for analysis. Genomic DNA 
was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsies. If necessary, tumour and adjacent 
normal tissue were separated by manual microdissection guided by a hematoxylin- and eosin-stained 
serial section. DNA extraction from blood was performed using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). 
Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced using the Sanger

method in most cases. Samples with low percentage tumour cell content were evaluated with a highly 
parallel sequencing method (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT) to increase sensitivity to approximately 
5% mutant allele burden. 
Of the 330 subjects enrolled in the study, at least partial RET sequence data from one or both sample 
types was obtained for 319 subjects. For blood DNA samples, RET exons 5, 8, 10, 11, and 13-16 
(which cover the vast majority of the characterized RET mutations) were analysed at a minimum. For 
tumour DNA samples, RET mutational hotspot exons 11 and 16 were analysed initially, with additional 
exons analysed subsequently if no mutations were identified in exons 11 and 16. For a sample to be 
considered negative for RET mutation, the complete DNA sequence for exons 10, 11, and 13-16 must 
have been obtained, and all RET sequence analysed must have been clearly free of alteration, with the 
exception of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) G691S, L56M, or R982C. Blood or tumour 
samples that showed evidence for a RET sequence alteration were considered RET mutation positive if 
the identified mutation is listed as related to MTC or MEN 2 syndromes in the American Thyroid 
Association Medullary Thyroid Cancer Guideline publication. Note that RET sequence alterations not 
described in this publication were classified in the ‘unknown’ category, even though some of these are 
likely to be functional mutations. Also described as ‘unknown’ was any sample lacking sufficient 
sequence coverage of RET and without an identified qualifying RET mutation. In addition, a subject is 
classified as having sporadic MTC if his or her blood or tumour DNA sample qualified as RET mutation 
negative as described in Table . RET mutation status, subjects with the common RET M918T mutation, 
and MTC disease type (sporadic or hereditary) were evaluated in PFS and response rate subgroup 
analysis. Criteria used to define MTC disease type, and RET and RET M918T mutation status are listed 
in Table 12. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 36/107 
 
  
  
 
Table 12. RET genotyping subgroup definitions (Study XL184-301) 
Overall, 48.2% of subjects showed evidence for a functional RET mutation in blood and/or tumour 
samples, while 12.4% are considered negative for RET mutation. An additional 39.4% are considered 
to be of unknown RET mutation status, due to missing sequence data or the presence of a RET 
mutation of unknown significance. 
RET M918T, an activating mutation found in exon 16, is associated with the MEN 2B syndrome, 
development of MTC, and poor prognosis. This mutation was detected in 54.9% of subjects for whom 
the exon 16 sequence was assessable (118 of 215 subjects). M918T was the predominant mutation 
detected in XL184-301 subjects overall; 74.2% of subjects with confirmed RET mutations harbor 
M918T (118 of 159 subjects with mutations). Only a minority of subjects had evidence for hereditary 
disease, with 20 subjects demonstrating the presence of a functional RET mutation in their blood DNA 
sample.  
Along with these typical MEN-associated mutations, three unusual germline RET alterations were also 
identified. RET I852M was detected in subject 1314-3007; this RET variant is thought to be weakly 
transforming (Machens et al. 2011) and may have cooperated with the somatic M918T mutation 
identified in the tumour of this subject. RET M1064T was identified in the blood DNA sample of subject 
1418-3005. This mutation has been associated with Hirschsprung’s disease, but its effect on RET 
function is unclear (Pelet et al. 1998). Subject 1418-3005 also had an M918T mutation in the tumour

sample, along with evidence of loss of the germline M1064 mutation in the tumour tissue. Finally, a 
novel sequence alteration was found in subject 4905-3001 (RET C478Y). This alteration is located in 
the fourth cadherin-like domain in the extracellular region of the receptor, but its significance is not 
known. 
Two  subjects  showed  discrepancy  between  their  tumour  and  blood  genotyping  results  (based  on 
presence or absence of the G691S SNP). Accordingly they have been classified as ‘unknown’  for RET 
mutation state. 
Table 13. Summary of RET Genotyping Results (Study XL184-301) 
The effect of the RET mutational state on PFS and response rate is summarised in Figure 1. Overall, 
activity from XL184 treatment was observed for all three RET mutational subgroups; hazard ratios 
favouring the XL184-treatment group were 0.24 for the RET mutation-positive subgroup, 0.47 for the 
RET mutation-negative subgroup, and 0.30 for the RET mutation-unknown subgroup for PFS analysis.

Figure  1.  Forest  plot  of  RET  mutation  subgroup  analyses  for  PFS  (IRC-determined,  ITT 
population) (Study XL184-301) 
Further genetic analysis showed that a small proportion of patients harboured somatic tumour 
mutations in HRAS, KRAS, or NRAS. These patients (n=16) showed significant prolongation of PFS (HR 
of 0.15) and an objective response rate of 31%. RET mutation negative patients with no evidence of 
RAS mutation (n=33) showed a decreased PFS benefit on cabozantinib (HR of  0.87) and a lower 
response rate of 18% compared to other mutational subgroups. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Following oral administration of cabozantinib, peak cabozantinib plasma concentrations are reached 
at 2 to 5 hours post-dose. Repeat daily dosing of cabozantinib at 140 mg for 19 days resulted in an 
approximately a 4- to 5-fold mean cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single 
dose administration; steady state is achieved by approximately Day 15. A high-fat meal moderately 
increased Cmax and AUC values (41% and 57%, respectively) relative to fasted conditions in healthy 
volunteers administered a single 140 mg oral cabozantinib dose. There is no information on the 
precise food-effect when taken 1 hour after administration of cabozantinib (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Based on the population-pharmacokinetic (PK) model, the volume of distribution (V/F) is 
approximately 349 L (SE: ± 2.73%).  
Cabozantinib is highly protein bound in vitro in human plasma (≥ 99.7%). Preliminary protein binding 
data obtained from the ongoing hepatic impairment study were provided, with albumin levels ranging 
from 2.7-4.3 g/dl. Based on the data provided, no effect of albumin level on plasma protein binding of 
cabozantinib was apparent down to albumin levels of 2.7 g/dl. This analysis may be supplemented 
later on upon completion of the hepatic impairment study, potentially extending the range of albumin 
levels investigated. This issue is covered in the RMP. 
Assessment report

Cabozantinib was metabolized in vivo. Four metabolites were present in plasma at exposures (AUC) 
greater than 10% of parent: XL184-N-oxide, XL184 amide cleavage product, XL184 monohydroxy 
sulfate, and 6-desmethyl amide cleavage product sulfate. Two non-conjugated metabolites (XL184-
N-oxide and XL184 amide cleavage product), which possess <1% of the on-target kinase inhibition 
potency of parent cabozantinib, each represent <10% of total drug-related plasma exposure. 
Cabozantinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 metabolism in vitro, as a neutralizing antibody to CYP3A4 
inhibited formation of metabolite XL184 N-oxide by >80% in a NADPH-catalyzed human liver 
microsomal (HLM) incubation; in contrast, neutralizing antibodies to CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. A 
neutralizing antibody to CYP2C9 showed a minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation 
(i.e., a <20% reduction). 
The plasma terminal half-life of cabozantinib in single dose studies in healthy volunteers is 
approximately 120 hours. Mean clearance (CL/F) at steady-state in cancer patients was estimated to 
be 4.4 L/hr in a population PK analysis. Within a 48-day collection period after a single dose of 14C-
cabozantinib in healthy volunteers, approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was 
recovered with 54% in faeces and 27% in urine.  
Currently, the consequences of renal impairment have been investigated in the population PK study 
only. This study suggests no effect of mild renal impairment. However, the number and range of CrCl 
values in the moderate renally patient population is limited, and these data cannot be used to predict 
cabozantinib PK in this patient population. Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with 
renal impairment. Cabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment 
since there is limited data in patients with severe renal impairment, and safety and efficacy have not 
been established (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). A dedicated renal impairment study has been 
initiated and is included in the RMP. 
Cabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with hepatic impairment, since there are limited 
data in patients with hepatic impairment, and safety and efficacy have not been established  (see 
SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). A hepatic impairment study has been initiated and is included in the RMP. 
There is little experience with cabozantinib in non-White patients (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
No specific dose adjustment for the use of cabozantinib in older people (≥ 65 years) is recommended. 
However, a trend in increased rate of SAEs has been observed in subjects aged 75 years and older 
(see SmPC section 4.2). 
Cabozantinib has not yet been investigated in the paediatric population. The lack of data in the 
population <18 years is indicated in the SmPC (see section 4.2). 
Cabozantinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9. Co-administration of strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) with 
cabozantinib should be approached with caution. Chronic co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
(e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or herbal preparations 
containing St. John’s Wort [Hypericum perforatum]) with cabozantinib should be avoided. Selection of 
an alternative concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce or inhibit CYP3A4 
should be considered (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5).

Non-conjugated metabolites are present only at relatively low (total as well as unbound) levels, and 
are less active than cabozantinib. Low activity of the relatively abundant XL184 monohydroxysulphate 
and 6 demethyl half-dimer sulfate metabolite was observed. Therefore, cabozantinib parent is 
indicated to be pivotal for its cabozantinib’s PD activity. 
Considering the limited importance of a number of metabolites (<10% of parent cabozantinib) further 
data regarding into identification of UGT pathways (leading to M3 and M8) and carboxyamidases 
(leading to M7) are not considered necessary. However, considering the importance of the 6-demethyl 
half-dimer sulfate (M2a) and XL184 monohydroxy sulfate (M9), the applicant was recommended to 
perform further in vitro experiments on the identification of the sulphotransferases responsible for 
formation of 6-demethyl half-dimer sulfate (M2a) and XL184 monohydroxy sulfate (M9) metabolites.  
The effect of proton pump inhibitors on the gastrointestinal absorption of cabozantinib has not been 
determined. Cabozantinib demonstrates pH dependent solubility; therefore the co-administration of 
cabozantinib with proton pump inhibitors may reduce a patient’s exposure to cabozantinib. The 
concomitant use with this therapeutic class is therefore not recommended (see SmPC section 4.4). A 
clinical pharmacology study is currently ongoing to investigate the potential effect of gastric pH 
affecting drugs (esomeprazole and famotidine) on cabozantinib PK and is included in the RMP. 
Cabozantinib has not been evaluated for possible interactions (as substrate) with other transporter 
pathways than P-gp. Therefore, studies to characterise whether cabozantinib may function as a 
substrate and/or inhibitor for a panel of individual drug transporters (ie, P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, 
OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1 and MATE2k) will be conducted and are 
included in the RMP.  
Cabozantinib is an inhibitor of P-gp in vitro. A warning against combination of cabozantinib and P-gp 
substrates has been included in the SmPC (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). At present, the outcome of 
different in vitro P-gp inhibition studies are not in agreement, precluding taking a decision on the need 
of an in vivo study. The Applicant will therefore conduct a follow-up experiment in Caco-2 cells. The 
need for conducting an in vivo P-gp inhibition study will be based on the outcome of that Caco-2 
study. This issue is covered in the RMP. 
The effect of cabozantinib on the pharmacokinetics of contraceptive steroids has not been 
investigated. As unchanged contraceptive effect may not be guaranteed, an additional contraceptive 
method, such as a barrier method, is recommended (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Pharmacodynamics 
Though cabozantinib is known to inhibit multiple RTKs involved in tumour growth and angiogenesis 
and metastatic progression of cancer, the precise mechanism of action of cabozantinib is not known. 
In line with the in vitro data regarding inhibition of multiple RTKs, certain pathways indeed appeared 
to be affected in vivo upon treatment with 175 mg cabozantinib (S)-malate (138 mg cabozantinib 
freebase), as shown by changes in biomarkers related to inhibition of VEGF, MET and KIT. Overall, the 
pattern of plasma marker modulation measured after cabozantinib exposure, with a significant 
increase in the circulating levels of VEGF and PlGF, and significant decreases in soluble forms of 
cabozantinib target receptors sVEGFR2 and sKIT after 29 days of treatment, is consistent with results 
reported for other inhibitors of the VEGFR2 signalling pathway, such as sunitinib and bevacizumab. 
Exposure to cabozantinib led to inhibition of the VEGFR2 and KIT receptors and downstream signalling 
pathways. The exposure-dependency of the VEGF, PlGF, VEGFR2 and KIT biomarkers to concurrent

cabozantinib concentration was statistically significant, though modest. Therefore, a target 
concentration for optimal PD effects cannot be derived from this analysis. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the Applicant has sufficiently described the clinical pharmacology of cabozantinib. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development plan for this submission of cabozantinib (CometriqTM, XL184) 175 mg OD in 
patients  with  progressive,  unresectable  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  medullary  thyroid  cancer,  is 
based on one pivotal Phase III XL184-301 study.  
The  results  of  the  expansion  cohort  of  the  phase  I  XL184-001  study  enrolling  25  patients  with  MTC 
were submitted as supportive information.

The proposed cabozantinib dosing regimen of 140 mg orally once-daily (corresponding to about 177 
mg L-malate salt) in patients with MTC has been selected on the results of the phase I dose escalation 
XL184-001 study. 
Study XL184-001 
In the phase I XL184-001 dose escalation trial conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors 
(N=85), with one expansion cohort (n=37) including 25 patients with MTC, cabozantinib was 
administered at doses ranging from 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg on an intermittent 5 & 9 schedule using a 
powder-in-bottle (PIB) formulation, at 175 and 265 mg on a once-daily schedule using a PIB 
formulation, and at 175 and 250 mg on a once-daily schedule using a capsule formulation (see also 
Clinical Efficacy, Supportive studies). 
The study used a conventional “3+3” design for dose escalation to determine the MTD. The maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of cabozantinib based on the first 28 days of continuous dosing was 175 mg 
(capsules) once daily. Dose-limiting toxicities included elevated aminotransferases, elevated lipase, 
mucosal inflammation, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE).

In the dose-expansion cohort, Grade 3 or 4 frequently (≥ 10% incidence) reported AEs were lipase 
increased, PPE, fatigue, weight decreased, blood amylase increased, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and 
pneumonia. Other than abdominal pain and pneumonia, the majority being judged by the investigator 
as drug-related. Of note, 31.4% of patients (n=11) had an AE leading to discontinuation of study 
treatment. 
Study XL184-201 
In the phase II XL184-201 study conducted in patients with glioblastoma multiforme, patients were 
treated with 175 mg OD cabozantinib dose. However, after enrollment of 46 patients the protocol was 
amended to explore efficacy and safety of a second cohort of patients receiving cabozantinib at 125 
mg dose, due to the high rate of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (84.8%), serious adverse events 
(52%, of which 54% were considered potentially drug-related) and adverse events requiring dose 
interruption and/or reductions (84.8%). The scarce tolerability of cabozantinib was considered related 
to the patient population of the study XL184-201, consisting of heavily pre-treated patients with 
glioblastoma multiforme.  
Based on these data, the proposed dose for further development in phase II and III studies as single 
agent given orally in patients with MTC is 175 mg OD (capsule formulation, as L-malate salt weight; 
138 mg freebase equivalent weight). The proposed cabozantinib dose for registration is 140 mg 
freebase equivalent weight.   
2.5.2.  Main study

An International, randomized, double-blinded, Phase 3 Efficacy study of XL184 versus Placebo in 
Subjects with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria 
Patients had to fulfil all of the following criteria for inclusion in the study: 
•  Had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of MTC that was unresectable, locally advanced, or 
metastatic, and disease that was measurable or nonmeasurable per mRECIST. 
•  Was at least 18 years old. 
•  Had an ECOG performance status ≤ 2. 
•  Had documented PD on computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone 
scan,  or  X-ray  using  mRECIST    at  screening  compared  with  a  previous  image  done  within  14 
months  of  screening.  Prior  to  Protocol  Amendment  2,  PD  was  determined  by  a  radiologist  at  the 
IRC using these criteria. Following approval of Protocol Amendment 2, PD was determined by the 
investigator  using  these  criteria.  Modification  of  the  RECIST  consisted  of  further  clarifications 
provided  by  the  Independent  Radiology  Review  Committee  that  further  clarified  the  rules  of  the 
original RECIST 1.0.

Treatments 
Pre-Treatment Period 
Screening evaluations were completed within 28 days prior to randomization to determine the 
eligibility of subjects, including radiographically documented disease progression by mRECIST 
compared to a radiologic assessment performed no more than 14 months previously.  
Eligibility tumor assessments were compared to historical assessments by a single reader at the IRC 
prior to randomization to determine if progression criteria per mRECIST were met. For subjects 
enrolled under Protocol Amendment 2, the investigator determined if progression criteria per mRECIST 
were met prior to randomization for the purpose of establishing eligibility  
Treatment Period 
Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either  140 mg (freebase equivalent) of cabozantinib or 
placebo capsules orally once per day until either intolerable toxicity or disease progression.  
Radiologic tumor assessments were performed every 12 weeks (± 5 days) from randomization until 
PD as determined by the investigator using mRECIST. Tumour assessments were evaluated by the 
blinded IRC to determine response and/or progression. Haematology and serum chemistry laboratory 
evaluations and vital signs assessments were conducted every two weeks during Cycles 1 and 2, and 
every four weeks starting with Cycle 3. Blood and tissue samples for biomarker and blood samples for 
PK assessments were collected at specific protocol-defined visits. At each study visit, evaluations of 
adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medication use were performed. 
Upon documented progression using mRECIST as determined by the investigator or unacceptable 
toxicity or other protocol-specified criteria, the subject discontinued study treatment and entered the 
post-treatment period. If study treatment was discontinued for reasons other than PD, the following 
efficacy and safety measures continued until documented tumour progression: tumour assessments; 
pharmacodynamic blood sampling; CTN, CEA, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and free thyroxine 
(FT4) measurements; and MDASI Thyroid Module. 
Post-Treatment Period 
Thirty days (+7 days) after the last dose of study treatment, subjects returned to the study site for 
post-treatment assessments. The investigator obtained follow-up information, including survival 
status, every 12 weeks (± 15 days) after the last dose of study treatment. The study did not permit 
crossover from the placebo arm to the XL184 arm.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint  
• 
Progression-free survival (IRC determined) defined as the time from randomization to documented 
PD per mRECIST criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Overall survival (defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause),  
•  Objective response rate (ORR, defined as the proportion of patients who had measurable disease 
at baseline for whom BOR at the time of data cut-off was complete response [CR] or partial 
response [PR] according to mRECIST criteria, and which was confirmed by a subsequent visit ≥28 
days later)

•  Disease stabilization rate (DSR, defined as the percentage of patients with CR, PR or stable 
disease [SD] for ≥24 weeks) 
•  Duration of response (defined as the time from first documentation of objective response 
[confirmed at a visit ≥28 days later] to PD by mRECIST or death due to any cause) 
•  Duration of stable disease (defined as the number of days between randomization and PD by 
mRECIST as determined by IRC or death for patients achieving SD as BOR). 
• 
Evaluation of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, changes of calcitonine and CEA serum 
levels, and assessment of biomarkers (VEGFR2, sKIT) and of the potential relationship between 
RET germline and/or tumor DNA sequence alteration and efficacy of cabozantinib.  
Sample size 
For the primary endpoint of PFS, assuming exponential PFS, proportional hazards, and a 2:1 
(cabozantinib:placebo) treatment allocation ratio, 138 events were required to provide 90% power to 
detect a HR of 0.571 using the log-rank test and a 2-sided significance level of 5%. This corresponds 
to a 43% reduction in the risk of progression or death, or a 75% increase in median PFS from 8 
months to 14 months. Under this design, the minimum observed effect that could have resulted in 
statistical significance for PFS was a 40.3% improvement (HR=0.713) in PFS from 8 to 11.2 months. 
If the true treatment effect was a 75% improvement in PFS, there was a 90% chance (power) of 
observing a 40.3% or greater improvement and a 50% chance of observing a 75% or greater 
improvement. 
For the key secondary efficacy endpoint of OS, assuming a single interim analysis at the 31% 
information fraction at the time of the primary analysis of PFS and a subsequent primary analysis, 217 
deaths were required to provide 80% power to detect an HR of 0.667 using the log-rank test and a 2-
sided significance level of 4%. This corresponds to a 33.3% reduction in the risk of death, or a 50% 
increase in median survival from 22 to 33 months. Under this design, the minimum observed effect 
that would result in statistical significance for the primary analysis of OS is a 33.3% improvement 
(HR=0.75) in OS from 22 to 29.3 months. If the true treatment effect is a 50% improvement in OS, 
there is an 80% chance (power) of observing a 33.3% or greater improvement, and a 50% chance of 
observing a 50% or greater improvement. 
A total of 315 eligible subjects (210 cabozantinib and 105 placebo) were planned to be randomized 
and followed to observe the required number of events within the planned study duration. With 
protocol Amendment 1, the number of subjects to be enrolled with nonmeasurable disease was 
capped at 10%.  
A single planned interim analysis for OS was performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis at the 
44% information fraction (i.e., 96 deaths events) using the data base cut-off date of 15 June 2011. 
Type I error was controlled by implementing a Lan-De Mets O’Brien-Fleming alpha-spending function 
to control the total alpha for OS at 0.04 level.  
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were to be randomized strictly sequentially in a 2:1 ratio.  
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 47/107 
 
  
  
 
 
Stratification  factors  were  age  (≤  65  years,  >  65  years)  and  prior  use  of  a  TKI  (yes,  no)  as 
determined at study entry. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind. 
Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint analysis 
Hypothesis testing to evaluate the duration of PFS between the two treatment arms was performed 
using the stratified log-rank test with a 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. The stratification factors 
were the same factors used to stratify the randomization: age (≤65 years versus >65 years) and 
known prior receipt of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (Yes versus No).  
The HR was estimated using a Cox regression model and included the treatment groups as the main 
effect and stratification factors, age, and prior TKI exposure. 
Censoring rules  
The following censoring rules were applied for the analyses of the primary endpoint (PFS): 
1. Subjects who died more than 26 weeks after their last adequate tumor assessment were right 
censored to the date of their last adequate tumor assessment; 2. Subjects who did not have any post-
baseline adequate tumor assessment and did not die within 26 weeks of randomization were right 
censored on the date of randomization; 3. Subjects with no adequate tumor assessment for more than 
26 weeks were right censored at their last adequate tumor assessment before the missing tumor 
assessments; 4. Subjects who received subsequent anticancer therapy (including palliative radiation 
to nontarget lesions or other local therapies) before experiencing an event were censored at the date 
of the most recent adequate tumor assessment prior to receipt of such treatment; 5. Subjects who did 
not progress or die (and were not otherwise censored) at the time of data cut-off were right censored 
on the date of their last adequate tumor assessment.

Recruitment 
The study (period from 10 September 2008 to 15 June 2011) was conducted at 90 centers across 23 
countries, randomized across Europe (184 pts: 124 treated with cabozantinib and 60 with placebo), 
North America (99 pts: 69 treated with cabozantinib and 33 with placebo), and rest of the World (44 
pts: 26 treated with cabozantinib and 18 with placebo). 
Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol (dated 21 April 2008) was subsequently amended twice. No patients were 
enrolled under the original protocol, 295 under protocol amendment 1 and 35 under protocol 
amendment 2. 
Amendment 1 (dated 11 June 2008, implemented after comments received from FDA during a SPA) 
essentially modified ECG and PK time points in order to match them, introduced the possibility to re-
escalate the dose of study drug no sooner than two weeks beyond resolution to Grade ≤1 or to the 
baseline value of symptoms, modified stratification factors, and capped enrollment of patients with 
only non measurable disease to 31 (10% of the total planned number). 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 49/107 
 
  
  
 
Amendment 2 (dated 24 September 2010) essentially changed determination of eligibility due to 
radiologic disease progression from a blinded radiologist of the IRC to the investigator. 
Furthermore, Country-specific protocol amendments were created for the United Kingdom, France, 
India and Germany, in order to meet specific country-requirements. They essentially concern 
inclusion/exclusion criterion of patients sexually active and women with childbearing potential, and 
they did not change the study population and planned analyses. However, a specific amendment was 
made in Germany in order to accept radiographic documentation of disease progression at study entry 
within 3 months instead of 28 days, as requested in the other countries. 
The SAP was modified 3 times: 
- 
- 
- 
on 22 July 2008, to revise stratification factors to match Protocol Amendment 1.0; 
on  07  February  2011,  in order  to  clarify  the  methods  used  to  address  missing  or  inadequate 
tumor  assessments  for  PFS  or  ORR,  refine  details of  planned  supportive  analyses,  include  an 
additional  sensitivity  analysis  of  PFS  based  on  investigator  assessment  of  radiographic 
progression,  match  the  inclusion  criterion  related  to  assessment  of  disease  progression  at 
baseline with protocol amendment 2; 
on  29  August  2011  (before  unblinding),  in  order  to  establish  an  imputation  rule  for  partial 
start  dates  of  subsequent  anticancer  therapy  and  for  partial  start  and  stop  dates  for  dose 
interruption. 
Protocol Deviations 
There were 33 protocol deviations reported in 28 patients treated with cabozantinib and 12 protocol 
deviations reported in 11 patients treated with placebo. 
Twenty-six deviations (18 in the cabozantinib and 8 in the placebo arm) concerned inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, whereas 15 deviations (11 in the cabozantinib and 4 in the placebo arm) concerned 
continuation of treatment after determination of disease progression per mRECIST by the investigator. 
A total of four deviations regarded incorrect dosing of study drug. All these deviations were 
determined to be major deviations.  
Other minor protocol deviations were reported, essentially regarding missed or out of window 
laboratory procedures or visits. 
Baseline data 
The great majority of patients were males (66.9%), white (89.4%), with a median age of 55 years 
(range, 20-86 yr), an ECOG PS 0 (54.2%) and stadium IVc of disease (95%) according to AJCC cancer 
staging at enrollment. Median time since initial diagnosis was 3.59 years in the cabozantinib arm and 
4.41 years in the placebo arm, and median time since development of metastasis was 1.94 years in 
the cabozantinib arm and 2.04 years in the placebo arm. The majority of patients had RET mutation 
positive status (48.1%). The great majority of patients had at least two metastatic sites (87%). 
No obvious imbalances between the cabozantinib and placebo arms were observed in several 
demographic and baseline characteristics evaluated, in particular no significant differences were found 
in terms of age, race, median weight, presence of measurable disease, AJCC stadium at time of 
enrollment, median number of prior anticancer therapy regimens received, previous treatment with 
radiotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and thyroidectomy.

However, slightly more patients in the cabozantinib group were males (68.9% vs 63.1%, 
respectively), former (38.8% vs 30.6%) or current (10% vs 2.7%) smokers, had ECOG PS 0 (56.2% 
vs 50.5%), greater median of the sum of the longest diameter for target lesions at baseline (106.15 
vs 88.8 mm), and shorter median time since initial diagnosis of MTC (3.59 vs 4.41 years), since 
metastasis (3.64 vs 4.64 years), and liver (69.4% vs 60.4%) and mediastinum (59.4% vs 54.1%) as 
tumor localization. In contrast, more patients in the placebo arm were females (36.9% vs 31.1%), 
had age ≤45 years (29.7% vs 24.7%), never smoked (66.7% vs 51.1%), had ECOG PS 2 (9.9% vs 
4.1%), RET positive tumors (52.3% vs 46.1%), and lung metastases (57.7% vs 53%).  
Regarding  the use of selected medications before start of the study, slightly more patients in the 
placebo arm used antidiarrhoeals (30.3% vs 25.2%) and antiemetics (7.3% vs 4.7%), whereas a 
slightly higher number of patients in the cabozantinib arm used antihypertensive drugs (26.6% vs 
21.1%) and bisphosphonates (10.3% vs 6.4%).

Systemic therapies prior study entry 
Overall, the treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to prior cancer therapy. Over 90% 
of subjects in each treatment group had a prior thyroidectomy (91.8% in cabozantinib arm and 93.7% 
in the placebo arm). The proportions of patients who received prior anticancer therapy, prior radiation 
therapy, or both, were similar between the treatment groups. The median (range) number of prior 
MTC therapy regimens per subject was 1.0 (1-6) in the cabozantinib arm and 1.0 (1-7) in the placebo 
arm.  
A total of 37.0% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 42.3% of subjects in the placebo arm 
received prior systemic therapy for MTC; prior use of a TKI was similar in each treatment group

(20.1% vs 21.6%, respectively). The most common prior anticancer therapies were vandetanib 
(11.4% vs 8.1%), doxorubicin (5.9% vs 6.3%), dacarbazine (5.0% vs 0.9%), sorafenib (5.0% vs 
7.2%), cisplatin (4.1% vs 3.6%), fluorouracil (4.1% vs 2.7%), therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals 
(3.2% vs 7.2%) and octreotide (0.5% vs 5.4%). Alongs with vandetanib and sorafenib, the most 
common TKI received by the patients were motesanib (3.2% vs 1.8%), sunitinib (2.7% vs 2.7%), 
axitinib (1.4% vs 0%), pazopanib (0.5% vs 1.8%), and imatinib (0% vs 1.8%).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary  objective:  Progression  Free  Survival  (IRC-determined  according  to  mRECIST,  ITT 
population) 
A total of 139 PFS events (42.1%) were included in the analysis (cut-off 06 April 2011), 79 (36.1%) 
events in the cabozantinib arm (58 [26.5%] as disease progression and 21 [9.6%] as deaths events) 
and 60 events (54.1%) in the placebo arm (50 [45%] as disease progression and 10 [9%] as death 
events). 
In the ITT population there was a statistically significant difference in PFS between treatment arms 
(HR=0.28, 95% CI 0.19-0.40, p<0.0001) at the stratified analysis. The estimated median PFS was 
48.6 weeks (11.2 months) in the cabozantinib arm and 17.4 weeks (4.0 months) in the placebo arm. 
The Kaplan-Meier PFS rates at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were 86% vs 57%, 70.1% vs 26.4%, 58.7% vs 
14.4%, 47.3% vs 7.2%, in the cabozantinib and placebo arm, respectively. 
In sensitivity analyses, the IRC and investigator agreed on subjects’ PD status 77.9% of the time, and 
the IRC and investigator agreed on PD dates 74.4% of the time.

Figure 4. Forest Plot for PFS by subgroup (Study XL184-301, IRC-Determined, ITT 
population) 
Secondary endpoint: Overall Survival (OS) 
An interim analysis of OS was conducted at the time of the primary analyses of PFS (cut-off date 15 
June 2011). A total of 96 deaths were reported, representing 44% (96/217) of the total required for 
the  pre-specified  primary analysis  of  OS.  The  median  time of  follow-up  (from randomization  through 
15 June 2011) was 13.9 months (range 3.6 - 32.5 months). 
In the ITT population, the proportion of deaths was similar in both treatment groups (30.1% vs 27% 
in  the  cabozantinib  and  placebo  arm,  respectively);  median  duration  of  OS  was  21  months  in  the 
cabozantinib  arm  and  could  not  be  estimated  in  the  placebo  arm  (HR  0.98,  95%  CI  0.63-1.52, 
p=0.9304). Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS were similar among all subjects at all time points. 
An updated (not pre-specified) OS analysis has been conducted with a cut-off date of 15 June 2012. 
The analysis is based on 162 (75%) of the 217 death events required for the final analysis (103 in the 
cabozantinib arm and 59 in the placebo arm). The HR was 0.83 (95% CI 0.60-1.14), median OS was 
26 months with cabozantinib compared with 20.3 months with placebo.

Exploratory objective: Patient-Reported Outcomes – MDASI Thyroid Module (MDASI THY) 
MDASI Thyroid Module was evaluated at screening and every 12 weeks (± 5 days) from randomization 
until disease progression, in order to evaluate the most frequently reported and most serious 
symptoms in patients with MTC. MDASI THY consists of 2 parts: 1) a part (Question 1-9) covering 13 
core cancer and treatment related symptoms with severity scored from 0 (not present) to 10 
(symptom as bad as you can imagine it could be); 2) a part (Questions 20-25) evaluating how 
symptoms have interfered with patient’s life in the previous 24 hours scored from 0 (no interference) 
to 10 (interfered completely).

A Primary Symptom Severity Score included diarrhea, fatigue, sleep disturbance, distress, and 
difficulty remembering. An Overall Mean Symptom Severity Score included the 13 “core” and six 
thyroid-specific items. A Mean Symptoms Interference Subscale was defined as the subject’s six 
interference items. Mean scores were calculated for all the composite scores when patients answered 
more than half of the items for that score. A high MDASI score indicates the presence of more 
symptoms. In the evaluation of difference in mean symptoms and interference change over time 
between treatment groups, an effect size of 0.5 (half of a SD of baseline values) was deemed clinically 
meaningful. 
At baseline, percentages of subjects in the combined cabozantinib and placebo groups rating MDASI-
THY symptom scores as of moderate or greater severity were: fatigue (38%), diarrhoea (35%), sleep 
disturbance (29%), hoarseness (28%) and emotional distress (27%). 
Approximately 75% of patients in each treatment group contributed to the MDASI-THY data at Week 
12. By Week 24, the percentage of patients completing the MDASI-THY assessment declined to 55% 
and 28% in the cabozantinib and placebo groups, respectively. At subsequent visits the number of 
patients further declined, therefore scores were not examined. 
At week 12 nausea, lack of appetite, dry mouth and feeling cold were clinically-meaningfully more 
severe in the cabozantinib arm compared to the placebo arm, as well as nausea, feeling cold and 
diarrhoea at week 24. Only shortness of breath was more severe in the placebo arm. However, at 
week 24 only 31 patients were included in the analysis. Interference with quality of life got worse in 
both arms but was not different between treatment arms at week 24.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The most relevant findings from the pivotal trial and the expansion cohort of the phase I XL184-001 
trial conducted in patients with MTC are shown in the table below: 
Table 25. Summary of Efficacy from clinical trials performed with cabozantinib and 
supporting this submission for MAA  
Clinical studies in special populations 
Cabozantinib has not been studied in children (< 18 years) or in pregnant or lactating women. 
Cabozantinib has been given to patients ≥75 years of age, but experience is very limited. Moreover 
the great majority of patients enrolled in the studies performed with cabozantinib to date were whites, 
with data essentially lacking in patients with other races (e.g., blacks, etc.). 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
To date, the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on cabozantinib pharmacokinetics, disposition and 
safety has not been studied in patients, therefore it is not known whether dose adjustment is 
appropriate. A phase I clinical pharmacology study evaluating the effect of hepatic impairment on 
cabozantinib PK is ongoing. A phase I study in patients with renal impairment is planned.

Supportive study 
Study XL184-001 
Study XL184-001 was an open-label, non-randomized, single-agent, dose escalation study to 
determine safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and biomarker 
status of cabozantinib. After a dose escalation phase to determine the MTD including doses ranging 
from 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg on an Intermittent 5&9 schedule using a powder-in-bottle (PIB) 
formulation, at 175 and 265 mg on a once-daily schedule using a PIB formulation, and at 175 and 250 
mg on a once-daily schedule using a capsule formulation, an expansion cohort in patients with MTC 
was conducted at dose level 175 mg OD cabozantinib. Overall, 37 patients with MTC were enrolled in 
Study XL184-001, of which 25 patients were enrolled in the expansion cohort. First signs of clinical 
activity were observed at dose levels ≥ 5.12 mg/kg PIB. Of the 25 patients, 21 (84%) were male, 16 
(64%) had an ECOG PS of 0 (36% had ECOG PS 1), and 24 (96%) were white. The mean time (SD) 
since initial diagnosis was 4.9 (± 4.471) years and the mean time since initial diagnosis of metastasis 
was 3.31 (± 3.067) years. Prior anticancer therapy (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) was received by 9 
(36%) patients (2 had received vandetanib and 2 sorafenib) and 16 (64%) patients had received no 
prior anticancer therapy.  
Of the 25 patients treated, 18 patients had discontinued study treatment at the time of cut off (19 
April 2010). Of note primary reason for discontinuation in the majority of patients was adverse event 
or SAE (not including death) (9 pts [36%]), objective radiological disease progression (3 pts [12%]), 
subject withdrew consent (not including AE) (3 pts [12%]), death (1 pt [4%]) and other reason (2 pts 
[8%]). 
All 25 patients were evaluable for response: partial response (PR) was reported in 7 patients (28%) 
and stable disease (SD) in 17 patients (68%), whereas disease progression was documented in 1 
patient (4%). The median time to response for 7 pts experiencing a PR was 28 days (range 21-118 
days). Median duration of treatment was 429 days in the 7 patients with PR (range 159-708+), but 3 
of them were still on treatment at time of cut off. Duration of treatment in 8 out 17 patients 
experiencing SD was more than 6 months.  
Three (25%) out of the 12 patients with MTC treated during the dose escalation phase of the study at 
dose levels other than 175 mg capsules or with PIB formulation had a best overall response of PR: 2 
patients treated at 5.12 mg/kg intermittent dosing, PIB formulation, and 1 patient treated with 265 
mg qd, PIB formulation. 
PFS was not assessed due to the high number of patients discontinuing study treatment without 
progression who did not undergo tumor assessment after stop of treatment. OS was not evaluated. 
According to the Applicant the majority of the patients had a RET mutation. Three patients were RET 
negative: 1 achieved confirmed PR, 1 not confirmed PR and 1 PD.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The proposed cabozantinib dose is 140 mg (free base) QD, administered orally. From a methodological 
point of view the dose selection is considered acceptable as based on the results of the phase I XL184-
001 study, employing a classical dose finding approach. However, by analysis of the results of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 66/107 
 
  
  
 
phase III pivotal XL184-301 trial where 75% of patients required at least one dose reduction after 
steady-state concentrations were reached (median time to dose reduction: 43 days) and 41% of 
patients needed two dose reductions due to persistent toxicity, serious concerns were raised regarding 
the appropriateness of the dose proposed for registration. From the data presented to date, it is not 
possible to correlate efficacy and dose. Based on efficacy data alone, it is not clear whether a lower 
dose than the MTD could be equally effective.  
Study XL184-301 is a pivotal, phase III, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double blind, 
placebo-controlled study. The two arms design of the study with placebo as comparator is considered 
acceptable, as at the time the study was performed no other standard treatment options were 
available. The population enrolled in the pivotal study reflects the target population as mentioned by 
the wording of the proposed indication. Minor imbalances between demographic and baseline 
characteristics are observed, but it is not expected that such differences could affect study results. 
PFS (IRC-determined according to modified RECIST criteria) was the primary study endpoint.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The choice of PFS as primary endpoint is considered acceptable. The results show a statistically 
significant improvement in PFS for cabozantinib compared with placebo (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.19-0.40, 
p=0.0001), with a gain in median PFS of 7.2 months in favour of cabozantinib (median PFS 48.6 vs 
17.4 weeks, respectively). Results are consistent with several sensitivity analyses, performed to 
evaluate robustness of the results and minimize the effect of potential informative censoring. The PFS 
effect appears to be maintained in all subgroups of the population treated, with the exception of 
patients with RET negative tumours where no statistical significance was achieved. The interim OS 
analysis, performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis and including 96 (44%) of death events 
did not show any significant difference between the two study arms (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.63-1.52, 
p=0.9304, median OS 21.1 months vs NA with cabozantinib and placebo, respectively). A higher 
percentage of patients randomized to placebo received post-study local (18.9% vs 13.2%) and 
systemic (45% vs 21.9%) anticancer therapy, including vandetanib (16.2% vs 9.6%) and other TKIs 
(23.4% vs 9.6%).  
Objective response rate (ORR: CR+PR, IRC assessed) was significantly higher with cabozantinib 
(27.9%) compared with placebo (0%). Disease stabilization rate was also significantly higher in the 
cabozantinib arm compared with the placebo arm (55.3% vs 13.5%, respectively).  
In the evaluation of patient reported outcome according to the MDASI THY score, several cancer 
related symptoms (like gastrointestinal symptoms and feeling cold), were significantly more frequently 
observed and with greater severity in the cabozantinib versus the placebo arm at weeks 12 after start 
of treatment, possibly related to the toxicity of the drug. 
Some evidence of activity appears to be observed in patients pre-treated with vandetanib (ORR: 7/25 
(28%), median PFS 12.8 vs 2.8 months with vandetanib and placebo, respectively), as it is  clear  that 
6 of 7 patients reporting tumor response after treatment with vandetanib actually stopped vandetanib 
treatment due to disease progression (data not shown). 
Impact of RET status and Dose  
Only a minority of patients had RET status determined on metastatic sites of disease. This raises 
concerns over the reliability of the RET mutation analysis procedures, in particular in patients reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 67/107 
 
  
  
 
as RET mutation negative. In effect, in 2 out of the 14 patients where primary tumour as well as 
metastatic tumour tissues were available, a discrepancy was observed in RET mutational status, being 
negative in the primary tumour and positive in the metastatic tissue. This supports the hypothesis that 
several patients classified as RET mutation negative actually could have acquired RET mutations in the 
course of disease as the result of further tissue dedifferentiation. Otherwise, the different RET status 
determination within one patient could also point toward a validation-problem of the RET mutation 
procedure. As the precise mechanism of action of cabozantinib on RET remains unclear, the impact of 
RET mutation status on the efficacy of cabozantinib needs to be further ascertained in a dose 
comparative study (XL-184-401). In addition to this, the same study will address possibility of giving 
effective lower dosages with less toxicity.  
Therefore, a conditional marketing authorisation was recommended to gather the missing information, 
taking into consideration that the risk-benefit balance of cabozantinib, as defined in Article 1(28a) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC, is positive (see Discussion on the benefit-risk balance. 
In the framework of the conditional marketing authorisation, given the need to confirm the benefit risk 
balance in RET mutation negative or unknown MTC patients, the following statements were included in 
the Product Information: 
Cometriq is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable locally 
advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma. 
For patients in whom Rearranged during Transfection (RET) mutation status is not known or is 
negative, a possible lower benefit should be taken into account before individual treatment decision 
(see important information in SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
A relationship between prolonged PFS and significant improvement in OS (HR 0.53, p=0.0179) has 
been demonstrated only in the subgroup of RET M918T mutation positive patients (n=81/219 
cabozantinib arm). OS has not yet been analysed in other RET and/or RAS mutation subgroups. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A statistically significant improvement in PFS with cabozantinib compared with placebo has been 
observed in the pivotal XL184-301 study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic MTC, 
experiencing radiologic disease progression within 14 months before start of treatment. The 7 months 
improvement in median PFS is considered of clinical relevance and is supported by a statistically 
significant improvement in tumour response and duration of response associated with treatment with 
cabozantinib.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
A dose-comparison study (XL-184-401) (140 mg vs 60 mg) in patients with hereditary or 
• 
sporadic medullary thyroid cancer. 
Patients with both sporadic and hereditary forms of MTC will be eligible for the study. Fresh tumor 
tissue samples will be required from all enrolled subjects, and guidelines will be provided to 
maximize tissue quality. Samples will undergo thorough evaluation for RET and RAS mutations. 
Tumor tissue samples initially will undergo histological evaluation, manual tumor enrichment, and 
DNA isolation. The resulting DNA samples will be evaluated for quality by a PCR-based amplification

test, and by Sanger sequencing for RET M918T. A replacement sample will be requested if an original 
sample fails during the PCR quality or the Sanger sequencing tests. Next generation sequencing of 
RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16 will be performed, which covers the vast majority of known RET 
mutations. In addition, samples will be evaluated for mutations in RAS gene hotspots (HRAS, KRAS, 
and NRAS genes). 
PK assessments will be required for all subjects (both dose groups). Results will be used to evaluate 
the exposure to cabozantinib at the 60 and 140 mg dose levels and to further characterize the 
population PK models and exposure response relationships of cabozantinib and possible metabolites 
in this population.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
• 
A mature OS analysis including subgroup analyses on relevant demographic and baseline 
tumour characteristics and potential confounding effect of post-study therapies. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Analysis  of  safety  of  cabozantinib  has  been  based  on  the  Safety  Analysis  Set,  comprising    of  three 
clinical  studies  performed  in  cancer  patients  receiving  at  least  one  dose  of  175  mg  cabozantinib  qd 
(n=295) or placebo (n=109), including a total of 348 (cabozantinib+placebo)  subjects with MTC : 
Table 26. Clinical Studies included in the cabozantinib’s Safety Analysis Set 
Patient exposure 
Across all subjects included in the Safety Analysis Set, 295 subjects were treated with cabozantinib 
and 109 subjects were treated with placebo. In the pivotal XL184-301 phase III study, 330 patients 
with MTC were included, of which 323 were included in the safety population: 214 were treated with 
cabozantinib 175 mg qd and 109 with placebo. In Study XL184-301, the median duration of exposure 
was longer, approximately twice as long, for the cabozantinib arm compared with placebo (203.5 days 
[6.7 months] vs 105.0 days [3.4 months]), corresponding to a mean number of cycles received per 
subject of 9.4 and 5.6 in the cabozantinib arm and placebo arm, respectively. As of the clinical cut-off 
date of 15 June 2011 for the pivotal phase III XL184-301 study, about half of the subjects in the 
cabozantinib arm and most of the subjects in the placebo arm had discontinued study treatment 
(54.2% vs 86.2%). 23.8% and 55.0% of patients in the cabozantinib and placebo arm, respectively 
discontinued study drug due to disease progression. Discontinuation due to AEs or SAEs unrelated to 
disease progression occurred in 16.4% and 8.3% of patients, respectively.  
Seventy-two percent of subjects treated with cabozantinib vs 28% of patients treated with placebo 
experienced dose interruptions. At least one dose reduction was needed in 79% of cabozantinib 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 69/107 
 
  
  
 
treated patients. Two or more dose reductions occurred in 41.% of patients treated with cabozantinib, 
which implies that the majority of subjects did not tolerate the initial dose, i.e. the dose intended for 
marketing. 
As a result of the frequent dose reductions only 54 subjects (25.2%) in the phase III XL184-301 study 
received cabozantinib at 175 mg daily as their final dose at the cut-off date, whereas 33.3% and 
41.6% of subjects received 125 mg and 75 mg of cabozantinib as the final dose, respectively. The 
overall median dose intensity was lower in the cabozantinib arm compared with placebo (125.31 
mg/day vs 175 mg/day), corresponding to a mean relative dose intensity of 71.60% vs 100.00% 
respectively.  
Moreover, median duration of treatment for the 175 mg, 125 mg and 75 mg dose levels were 39, 52.5 
and 91 days, respectively. The short duration of treatment with 175 mg indicates also that this dose 
was not tolerated by the patients. Relative dose intensity in the cabozantinib group decreased quickly 
over the first four 4-week cycles in this study, whereas in the placebo group, relative dose intensity 
was generally more stable over time. The median time to first dose reduction in the cabozantinib arm 
was only 43 days. 
High inter-subject variability in exposure has been demonstrated with PopPK analysis Subjects with 
higher model-predicted oral clearance (ie, those with low predicted steady state cabozantinib AUC 
values) tended to dose reduce later in the course of treatment. 
Adverse events 
Adverse  events  were  coded  according  to  MedDRA  system.  All  AEs  were  graded  by  the  investigators 
per  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  v3.0.  A  treatment-emergent  adverse 
event  (TEAE)  was  any  AE  or  laboratory  abnormality  that  started  or  worsened  after  the  first  dose  of 
study treatment.  
In the pivotal phase III XL184-301 study 100% of patients in the cabozantinib arm versus 94.5% of 
patients in the placebo arm experienced a TEAE, of which 98.6% vs 74.3%, respectively, were 
assessed as drug related. Treatment related grade 3 or 4 TEAEs occurred more frequently in the 
cabozantinib group (64.0%) vs placebo group (19.3%) (Table 14). The level of AEs in the placebo arm 
of Study XL184-301 indicate that the underlying disease generate numerous disease related AEs. 
However, Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs, SAEs and deaths due to other causes than PD were all experienced 
approximately more than twice as often in the cabozantinib arm as in the placebo arm, indicating that 
cabozantinib treatment is accompanied by numerous important AEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014

Table 27. Overview of Treatment Emergent  Adverse Events (Safety Analysis Set) 
TEAEs (any grade, by preferred term) more frequently observed (≥20% difference) with cabozantinib  
compared with placebo were palmar plantar erythrodysesthaesia syndrome (=hand-foot syndrome, 
PPE) (50.0 % vs 1,8%), weight loss (47.7% vs 10.1%), hair colour changes (33.6% vs 0.9%), 
decreases appetite (45.8% vs 15.6%), diarrhea (63.1% vs 33.0%), dysgeusia (34.1% vs 5.5%), 
stomatitis (29.0% vs 2.8%), hypertension (29.4% vs 3.7%), vomiting (24.3% vs 1.8%), and nausea 
(43.0 vs. 21.1). All these AEs were judged by the investigator as at least possibly drug related. 
Regarding grade 3 or 4 TEAEs a similar pattern was observed: 64.0% of patients receiving 
cabozantinib experienced a grade 3 or 4 treatment related TEAEs versus 19.3% of patients receiving 
placebo.  
The most common grade ≥3 AEs more frequently seen  in the cabozantinib arm compared to the 
pacebo arm were: diarrhoea (15.9% cabozantinib arm, 1.8% placebo arm), PPE (12.6% vs 0%), 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 71/107 
 
  
  
 
 
weight loss (4.7% vs 0%), decreased appetite (4.7% vs 0.9%), nausea (1.4% vs  0%), and fatigue 
(9.3% 2.8%). In contrast, there was a higher incidence of Grade ≥3 dyspnoea in the placebo arm 
(2.3% vs 10.1%). 
Grade 4 AEs occurred in 14.5% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm vs 10.1% in the placebo arm; the 
most frequently reported were hypocalcaemia (3.3% in the cabozantinib arm versus 0% in the 
placebo arm) and pulmonary embolism (2.3% vs 0.9%). 
Several of the most common Grade 3 or higher TEAEs (e.g. diarrhoea and PPE) were not among the 
most frequently reported SAE, indicating that the majority of the Grade 3 or higher TEAEs may not be 
life-threatening. However, in a palliative setting numerous Grade 3 or higher TEAEs is of concern. 
Moreover, It is evident that most grade 3 or higher AEs occurred with 175 mg of cabozantinib and 
within the first cycles of treatment. Although many AEs tend to be reversible over time with the 
appropriate dose reductions applied, some AEs like PPE and diarrhea only resolve slowly over time and 
tend to persist,  which will likely negatively influence quality of life over a longer period of time. These 
results further underscore the importance an appropriate dose finding to prevent patients receiving a 
too high starting dose of 175 mg of cabozantinib.

Adverse Events of special interest (AESI) 
Consistent with the expected pharmacology, the pre-clinical toxicology profile and the mechanism of 
action of cabozantinib including VEGF inhibition and the population treated, AEs of special interest 
(AESI) included gastrointestinal perforation, gastrointestinal fistula, intra-abdominal and pelvic 
abcess, non-gastrointestinal fistula, hemorrhage (CNS and non-CNS), osteonecrosis, 
thromboembolism (venous and arterial), hepatocellular toxicity, and pancreatitis. 
Gastrointestinal (GI) Perforation 
In the pivotal study XL184-301, GI perforation occurred in 7 (3.3%, all grade 3 or 4) patients treated 
with cabozantinib vs 0 percent in the placebo group. No grade 5 perforation was seen. No GI 
perforation occurred in studies XL184-001 and XL184-201. Three of 7 patients with GI perforation had

underlying GI disorders prior to study entry, including Crohn’s disease, chronic pancolitis, irritable 
bowel disease and diverticulosis. 
Gastrointestinal fistula 
Two patients treated with cabozantinib in the X184-301 experienced GI fistula: one patient developed 
a grade II anal fistula resulting from an anal abcess, and one patient with metastases to the neck, 
lung, and pre-tracheal and para-tracheal lymph nodes, prior radiation therapy to the neck and an 
extensive surgical history, developed a grade 5 (fatal) oesophageal fistula. No events of gastro-
intestinal fistula occurred in the placebo group.  
There was one event of grade 3 gastric fistula  observed in Study XL184-001. 
Abcesses 
In the cabozantinib arm abcess AEs were reported more frequently than in the placebo arm in Study 
XL184-301 (7.9% vs 0%). In the cabozantinib arm, the median time to first incidence was 17 weeks; 
the most frequently reported in the cabozantinib arm were tooth abscess (3.3% vs 0%), anal abscess 
(1.4% vs 0%), and lung abscess (1.4% vs 0%).  
Five patients (2.3%) treated with cabozantinib in study XL184-301 experienced intra-abdominal or 
pelvic abscesses. There were three Grade 2 anal abcesses and two Grade 3 events (peridiverticular 
abcess and peritoneal abcess). There were no Grade 4 or 5 events of intra-abdominal and pelvic 
abscesses. The incidence of events of intra-abdominal and pelvic abscess was higher in phase I Study 
XL184-001 and similar in Study XL184-201 compared with the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-301 
(5.7% and 2.2%, respectively vs 2.3%). Of the five subjects who experienced events of intra-
abdominal or pelvic abscess in Study XL184-301, one event was associated with a Grade 3 event of 
large intestine perforation and one event was associated with a Grade 2 anal fistula. 
Non-gastrointestinal perforation and fistulas 
In the pivotal XL184-301 study, non-gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 8 patients (3.7%), 
including 3 patients with a trachea-oesophageal fistula, 2 patients with a tracheal fistula, 1 patient 
with a sinus fistula, 1 patient with a nasal septum perforation and 1 patient with a 
pneumomediastinum. One patient with an extensive prior history of neck surgery and radiation 
therapy died due to the trachea-oesophageal fistula. Median time to development of a clinical fistula 
was 11.5 weeks in patients treated with cabozantinib. No non-gastro-intestinal fistulas occurred in the 
placebo group and in studies XL184-001 and XL184-201.  
Five out of 6 subjects who experienced tracheal fistula, acquired trachea-oesophageal fistula, or 
pneumomediastinum had lung metastasis at baseline. One of these subjects also had metastasis to 
the bronchus and four of these subjects also had mediastinal metastasis at baseline. One subject had 
metastasis to the mediastinum and partial infiltration of the trachea. Only one of these subjects had 
received prior radiotherapy to the mediastinum. Therefore, tumour infiltration in the trachea and prior 
radiotherapy might be risk factors for development of trachea(-oesophageal) fistulas.

Non-CNS haemorrhage 
Non-CNS haemorrhage occurred more frequently in the cabozantinib arm compared  to the placebo 
arm in Study XL184-301 (3.3% vs 0.9%). In the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-301, the median 
time to first occurence of non-CNS haemorrhage AE was 13 weeks. Grade 3 events consisted of 
haemorrhoidal haemorrhage, colonic haematoma, duodenal ulcer haemorrhage, and intestinal 
haemorrhage. There was one grade 4 hemoptysis in a patient with a medical history of hemoptysis. 
There were 2 grade 5 events which consisted of one event of haemorrhage and one event of 
haemoptysis.  
Non-CNS haemorrhage occurred at similar rates in Studies XL184-001 and XL184-201 compared with 
the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-301 (2.9% and 6.5%, respectively vs 3.3%).  
CNS haemorrhage 
Only  in  study  XL-184201  where  patients  with  GB  were  treated  with  cabozantinib,  CNS  haemorrhage 
occurred  in  2  (4.3%)  patients.  No  CNS  haemorrhages  were  reported  in  Study  XL184-301  within  30 
days  after  the  last  study  drug  administration,  whereas  one  patients  reported  a  grade  2  intracranial 
haemorrhage more than 30 days after the last administered dose of cabozantinib. 
Osteonecrosis 
Osteonecrosis occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with cabozantinib in study XL-184-301 versus 0% 
in patients treated with placebo. In the cabozantinib arm, the median time to first incidence of 
osteonecrosis was 21 weeks. The incidence of Grade 3 osteonecrosis of the jaw was 0.5%, which was 
reported as a SAEs as well. In these patients, 2 out of 3 had a history of osteonecrosis of the jaw or 
tooth infection prior to the event of osteonecrosis. 
Arterial and venous thromboembolism 
Five (2.3%) patients receiving cabozantinib in the XL-184-301 study experienced arterial 
thromboembolism, all of except one were SAEs. No arterial thromboembolism occurred in the placebo 
group. Mean time to occurrence was 19.0 weeks. Events included transient ischemic attack, arterial 
thrombosis of the limb, cerebral infarction, and thrombosis. There were no grade 4 or 5 AEs of arterial 
thromboembolism in study XL 184-301. One patient who experienced a TIA had cardiovascular risk 
factors. Two other patients in which arterial thromboembolism occurred underwent procedures that 
increased the risk for such event. 
The incidence of venous thromboembolism was higher in the cabozantinib arm versus the placebo arm 
in Study XL184-301 (5.6%; (grade 3 or 4: 4.2%) vs 2.8%). In the cabozantinib arm in Study XL184-
301, the median time to first incidence was 13 weeks. The incidence of events of venous 
thromboembolism was slightly higher in Study XL184-001 compared to study XL184-201 and to the 
cabozantinib arm in Study XL184-301 (8.6% and 4.3%, respectively vs 5.6%).   
Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatocellular toxicity (including hepatic failure, hepatotoxicity, toxic hepatitis) occurred more often in 
the cabozantinib group versus the placebo arm in Study XL184-301 (2.8% vs 0.9%). There was one 
event of Grade 5 hepatic failure in the cabozantinib arm: the subject had liver metastases and had 
discontinued cabozantinib due to progressive disease. There was one event of Grade 5 hepatic failure 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 77/107 
 
  
  
in the placebo group as well. Four out of the 6 cabozantinib-treated subjects who experienced 
hepatocellular toxicity had liver metastases. There were no events of hepatocellular toxicity reported 
in studies XL184-001 and -201. 
Four cabozantinib-treated and 3 placebo-treated subjects had drug-induced liver injury based on 
laboratory findings. Three of the cabozantinib-treated subjects had liver metastases at baseline and 
one patient had a history of Gilbert’s disease.  
Pancreatitis 
Pancreatitis was more frequently reported in the cabozantinib arm versus the placebo arm in Study 
XL184-301 (5 patients: 2.3% vs 1 patient: 0.9%). In the cabozantinib arm in Study XL184-301 
median time to first incidence was 36 weeks. All grade 3 events (1.4%) in the cabozantinib arm were 
reported as SAE. There were no Grade 4 or 5 events of pancreatitis.  
Palmar-plantar  erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE) 
Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE) was very common (50.0%; 12.6% Grade 3, 
21.5% Grade 2, and 15.4% Grade 1) in the cabozantinib arm compared to placebo (1.8%) in study 
XL184-301. There were no grade 4 or 5 PPE events. 
In study XL184-001 PPE occurred even more frequently: 62.9% of patients experienced PPE, in 20% 
was of grade 3 severity. 
Weight loss 
In study XL184-301 weight loss was more frequently reported in the cabozantinib arm compared with 
the placebo arm (47.7% vs. 10.1%; grade 3 4.7% vs 0%). No SAEs of weight decreased were 
reported. The incidence of subjects with a >10% weight loss from baseline was 43.0% in the 
cabozantinib arm and 16.5% in the placebo arm.  Concomitant symptoms in this group were diarrhoea 
(80.4%), anorexia (62.0%), mucositis (57.6%), nausea/vomiting (60.9%), dysgeusia/ageusia, and 
abdominal pain (34.8%). Weight loss AEs resulted in dose modification in 12.6% of cabozantinib 
treated subjects and in 0% of placebo treated subjects. 
Mucositis 
Mucositis-related AEs were more frequently reported in the cabozantinib (58%) arm of Study XL184-
301 compared with placebo (6.5%). The most frequently reported Preferred Terms (PT) in the 
cabozantinib arm were stomatitis (29.0%; 1.9% Grade 3) and mucosal inflammation (23.4%; 3.3% 
Grade 3). Events were generally manageable with dose reductions. Only few patients discontinued 
treatment with cabozantinib because of diarrhea or mucositis. 
Pneumonia 
Pneumonia occurred at similar rates in both groups of study XL184-301: 3,7% in the cabozantinib arm 
vs 3.7% in the placebo arm. Pneumonia aspiration (2.8% vs. 0.9%), bronchopneumonia (0.9% vs. 
0%), pneumonitis (0.9% vs 0%), lung infiltration (0.5% vs 0%), and bacterial pneumonia (0.5% vs. 
0%) occurred more often in the cabozantinib arm compared with the placebo arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014

There was 1 grade 5 aspiration, 1 grade 5 bronchopneumonia and 1 grade 5 pneumosepsis reported in 
the cabozantinib arm, whereas 2 subjects in the placebo arm died of pneumonia. 
Wound complication 
A 1.9% rate of wound complications was reported in the cabozantinib arm versus 0.9% in the placebo 
arm of study XL184-301. There were no grade 4 or 5 events. 
Reversible posterior leuco-encephalopathy (RPLS) 
One patient experienced grade 4 RPLS in the cabozantinib arm of study XL184-301, which AE was 
reported as a SAE as well. 
Hypertension 
Hypertension occurred frequently in the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-301 compared with placebo 
(29.4% vs 3.7%). Five events (2.3%) in the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-301 were reported as 
SAEs. Grade 3 hypertension was reported in 7.9% of subjects treated with cabozantinib and in 0% of 
patients treated with placebo. There were no Grade 4 or 5 events of hypertension and nearly all of 
these events were reported to be related to study medication (26.2% with cabozantinib, 3.7% with 
placebo). The incidence of hypertension was similar in Studies XL184-001 and XL184-201 compared 
with the cabozantinib arm in Study XL184-301 (34.3% and 39.1%, respectively vs 29.4%). 
Hypocalcemia 
In Study XL184-301, there was a higher incidence of hypocalcaemia in the cabozantinib arm 
compared with placebo (21.0% [grade 3 9.3%] vs 4.6% [grade 3:0%]). Six events (2.8%) in the 
cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-301 were reported as SAEs.  
Elevated TSH 
In Study XL184-301, there was a higher incidence of serum TSH increase in the cabozantinib arm 
compared with the placebo arm (13.1% vs 2.8%, respectively). The events were of Grade 1 intensity 
(8.9% cabozantinib arm, 1.8% placebo arm) or Grade 2 (4.2%, 0.9%). 
A thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value above normal after first dose was observed in 57% of 
patients on cabozantinib versus 19% of patients on placebo (regardless of baseline values). Ninety-
two percent of patients on the cabozantinib arm had a prior thyroidectomy, and 89% were taking 
thyroid hormones prior to first dose. 
QT prolongation 
The effect of cabozantinib on QT interval prolongation was evaluated in study XL184-301. 
Electrocardiograms were obtained in triplicate at screening, at pre-dose and 2, 4 and 6 hours post-
dose during Day 1 (C1D1), and Day 29 (C2D1), and centrally read by a cardiologist blinded to study 
treatment. All scheduled ECG assessments on Days 1 and 29 were time matched with PK samples.  
No ECG’s were performed in healthy subjects for ethical reasons. 
No increase in QTcF change from baseline (ie, delta-QTcF) for cabozantinib-treated subjects was seen 
on Day 1, but a significant increase was seen on Day 29 for the cabozantinib arm versus placebo: 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 79/107 
 
  
  
+11.5 ms in the cabozantinib group vs. 1.7 ms in the placebo group 2 hours post-dose, 8.4 ms vs -
0.8 ms 4 hours post-dose and 7.9 vs -2.3 ms 6 hours post-dose.  
Although data in the high range cabozantinib concentrations are limited, delta QtcF seems to increase 
with higher cabozantinib concentrations. 
Overall, these results suggest a mild to moderate increase of mean QTcF at day 29 (where steady 
state plasma concentrations of cabozantinib have been reached) of 10 ms (upper bound of one-sided 
95% CI <15 ms) from baseline. A total of 5 patients treated with cabozantinib in the XL184-301 study 
experienced QT prolongations (3 of grade 1; 1 of grade 2). This effect was not associated with a 
change in cardiac wave form morphology or new rhythms. No cabozantinib-treated subjects had a 
QTcF >500 ms (see SmPC section 4.8). 
No other cardiac arrhythmias including Torsade de pointes have been reported. The PR interval and 
QRS interval did not show changes considered clinically relevant. 
Cardiac related events 
There were two patients with cardiopulmonary failure in study XL184-301: one (0.9%) in the 
cabozantinib and one in the placebo group (0.9%). The patient in the cabozantinib arm with a medical 
history of dysphagia experienced grade 4 cardiac arrest and subsequently grade 5 cardiopulmonary 
failure, possibly related to aspiration of study medication. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the XL184-301 study SAEs occurred more frequently in the cabozantinib arm compared with the 
placebo arm (42.1% vs 22.9%). The incidence of SAEs in Studies XL184-001 and XL184-201 were 
similar to XL184-301. SAEs that occurred more frequently in the cabozantinib arm compared with the 
placebo arm were hypocalcaemia (2.8% vs 0%), mucosal inflammation (2.8% vs 0%), hypertension 
(2.3% vs 0%), and pulmonary embolism (2.3% vs 0%), all of which were regarded as treatment 
related. Overall, the incidence of SAEs considered by the investigator to be treatment-related was 
33.2% in the cabozantinib arm and 6.4% in the placebo arm (Table 30).

Table 30. Summary of Serious Adverse Events (Preferred Terms with ≥1%Incidence in the 
Study XL184-301 Cabozantinib Arm) (Safety Analysis Set) 
The SAEs with a median onset within the first 30 days of study treatment included abdominal pain, 
hypocalcemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, vomiting, PPE, and hypokalaemia. Median time to first 
toxicity for GI perforation, GI fistula and Intra-abdominal/Pelvic Abscess was 7, 29 and 2 weeks, 
respectively. Although there are few observations, it appears as if at least half of such events occurred 
during the first two months of treatment, adding additional uncertainty to whether dose reductions is 
a suitable strategy to avoid SAEs.Overall, in study XL184-301, the incidence of deaths in the 
cabozantinib arm was slightly higher than in the placebo arm (30.4% vs 27.5%). There was a higher 
incidence of deaths in the cabozantinib arm within 30 days of last dose (10.3% vs 7.3%). Of note, in 
spite of the high frequencies of dose reductions and the short median time interval patients received

175 mg dose, half (11/22) of deaths through 30 days after the last dose in the cabozantinib arm 
occurred at the highest dose level. 
The number of subjects experiencing an SAE decreases with lower doses: 29%, 22% and 17% of 
subjects experienced an SAE among those who received the 175, 125 and 75 mg dose levels 
respectively 
Most frequent occuring SAEs had a lower frequency during the period after the final dose reduction, 
with the exception of dysphagia (rates are similar before and after last dosereduction but equivalent 
to rates in the placebo arm) and pulmonary embolism (2 events[0.002 per person month] before final 
dose reduction vs. 3 events [0.003 per person month]after final dose reduction). 
The incidence of deaths after 30 days of last dose was similar in both arms (20.1% vs 20.2%). 
Almost 80% of patients in the pivotal phase III study were younger than 65 years, not fully 
representing the clinical population with MTC. Although SAES in patients aged 74 years and younger 
did not differ from SAEs in the 75+ group and data were very limited, a trend in increased rate of 
SAEs in the 75+ group of patients treated with cabozantinib have been observed compared to patients 
aged 74 years and younger (61.5% vs. 40.1%).  
Deaths 
Overall, in study XL184-301, the incidence of deaths in the cabozantinib arm was slightly higher than 
in the placebo arm (30.4% vs 27.5%). There was a higher incidence of deaths in the cabozantinib arm 
within 30 days of last dose (10.3% vs 7.3%). The incidence of deaths after 30 days of last dose was 
similar in both arms (20.1% vs 20.2%). 
The incidence of death through 30 days of last dose due to disease progression was similar between 
the cabozantinib and the placebo arm (4.7% vs 4.6%). However, death due to other causes occurred 
more frequently in the cabozantinib arm than in the placebo arm (5.6% vs 2.8%). These included 
infections (3 cases; 1.4%), fistula (3 cases;1,4%) respiratory failure (2 cases; 0.9%), haemorrhage 
(1 case; 0.4% ). In three patients, the cause of death was listed as sudden death, death, cause not 
otherwise specified (NOS), cardiopulmonary failure, or cardiac arrest (multiple causes specified for one 
case).  
Review of the case narratives suggests no potential association of these death events to Torsades de 
Pointes (related to QTc prolongation). When analysing, causes of death appear to be heterogeneous 
and might be confounded by underlying disease factor. However, the more frequent occurrence of 
fatal fistulas and hemorrhage have been observed with other VEGF inhibitors. 
For all grade 5 SAEs combined, the rate was the same before and after the last dose reduction of 
cabozantinib (9 events [0.009 per person-month] in each period) and the overall rate per person-
month of Grade 5 SAEs in the cabozantinib arm was lower than in the placebo arm 
The reasons for death in the placebo arm were progressive disease (5 subjects); shock (1 case; 
0.9%), acute respiratory distress (1 case; 0.9%), and general deterioration (1 case; 0.9%). 
The incidence of deaths in Study XL184-001 was similar to that in the cabozantinib arm in Study 
XL184-301 (34.3% vs 30.4%). The overall incidence of deaths in cabozantinib-treated subjects in 
Study XL184-201 was higher than in the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-301 (82.6% vs 30.4%), 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014

probably due to the higher mortality rate in patients with glioblastoma compared to patients with 
progressive MTC. 
Laboratory findings 
In study XL184-301 the most common hematological abnormalities were: lymphopenia (53.3% vs 
47.7% in the cabozantinib vs placebo arm, respectively, with 15,4 % and 9.2 % being grade 3 AEs), 
neutropenia (35.0% vs 12.8% in the cabozantinib vs placebo arm, respectively, with 2.8 % and 1.8 % 
being grade 3 AEs), and decreased platelets (34.6% vs 3.7%, respectively, with 0% and 2.8% being 
grade 3 AEs). Decreased haemoglobin was equally reported in the cabozantinib (39.3%; grade 3 or 4 
AEs 1.9%) and placebo (40.4%; grade 3 or 4 AEs 3.7%) arms. 
The most common biochemical abnormalities were liver chemistry abnormalities: AST increase (86.4% 
vs 30.3% in the cabozantinib and placebo arms, respectively, with 3.3% vs 1.8% being grade 3 or 4 
AEs), ALT increase (85.5% vs 39.4%, respectively, with 6.1% vs 1.8% being grade 3 or 4 AEs), ALP 
increased (51.4% vs 32.1%, respectively, with 1.9% vs 2.8% being grade 3 or 4 AEs), decreased 
albumin (43.0% vs 15.6%, respectively, with 1.9% vs 0% being grade 3 or 4 AEs), total bilirubin 
increased (24.8% vs 13.8%, respectively, with 1.4% vs 4.6% being grade 3 or 4 AEs).   
The most common grade 3 or 4 other biochemical abnormalities were decreased calcium (12.1% in 
the cabozantinib arm vs. 2.8% in the placebo arm), increased lactate dehydrogenase (35.0% vs 
3.7%), increased lipase (11.2% vs. 9.2%), increased amylase (4.7 vs 7.3%), decreased potassium 
(3.7 vs. 2.8%), decreased phosphorus (3.3% vs 0.9%), and proteinuria (1.4% vs 0%). 
Grade 3 events of activated PTT increased occurred in 7 (3.3%) subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 
no placebo subject. 
Regarding thyroid function, hypothyroidism was reported as an AE in 9.3% of cabozantinib subjects 
and 0.9% of placebo subjects. Serum TSH increase occurred in 13.1% of cabozantinib subjects versus 
2.8% of placebo subjects. Of note, at enrolment, most subjects in each treatment group had prior 
thyroidectomy (91.8% in the cabozantinib group and 93.7% in the placebo group), and 89.3% of 
cabozantinib treated subjects and 91.7% of placebo-treated subjects were taken thyroid hormone 
replacement therapy. 
Safety in special populations 
A population PK analysis was performed based on a pooled analysis of cabozantinib plasma 
concentrations from Studies XL184-001 (capsule cohorts: 175 mg/day and 250 mg/day, N = 40), 
XL184-201 (Group A, N = 39), and XL184-301 (N = 210). The dose was 175 mg/day of the L-malate 
salt form of cabozantinib, except for five subjects in Study XL184-001 who were dosed at 250 
mg/day.  
Grade > 3 liver biochemistry abnormality appears to correlate with AUC steady state levels of 
cabozantinib, where for weight loss and diarrhea, correlations were not that clear. Of note, AE of 
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE (Grade >1) in cabozantinib-treated subjects did not show a 
correlation with AUC, although results were difficult to interpret because many subjects experienced 
dose reductions or interruptions.

Hepatic impairment 
No studies specifically in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. All patients included 
in the studies performed with cabozantinib were required to have bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN and ASAT/ALAT 
≤ 2.5.  No treatment related AEs were sorted out by severity of liver dysfunction. 
Renal impairment 
No studies in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. All patients included in the studies 
performed with cabozantinib to date were required to have serum creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN. 
Based on baseline calculated creatinine clearance, no effect of mild renal impairment on clearance of 
cabozantinib was detected. 
Paediatric population 
No studies in paediatric populations have been performed to date with cabozantinib, therefore no data 
over safety of cabozantinib in paediatric patients are available.  
Age 
In the three clinical studies included in the Safety set, the overall incidence of the treatment related 
common AEs was similar between age groups (<65 years, 65-75, and ≥ 75 years). In the pivotal 
XL184-301 study, patients treated with cabozantinib <65 years reported higher incidence of palmar 
plantar erythrodysethesia compared to patients 65-75, and ≥ 75 years  (51.8% vs 42.9 and 46.2%). 
Constipation, hypocalcemia and decreased appetite were more often seen in patients treated with 
cabozantinib aged ≥75 years compared to patients in the other age categories. 
Gender 
In study XL184-301, the incidence of AEs was similar in female and male patients in the cabozantinib 
group (100.0% vs 100.0%) and in the placebo group (92.8% vs 97.5%). In the cabozantinib group, 
there was a higher incidence of nausea (56.9% females, 36.9% males), and vomiting (35.4% 
females, 19.5% males) in females, whereas males and females who received placebo reported nausea 
and vomiting at a similar, lower frequency (20.5 vs 22% and 0 and 5% respectively). 
In XL184-001 and XL184-201 studies, a similar trend was observed. 
Race 
In  study  XL184-301  study,  89.6%  of  subjects  that  were  treated  with  cabozantinib  were  whites.  The 
overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 events was similar among race groups (63.5% white vs 66.7% non-
white). No data were provided regarding type of AEs among different races.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In vitro studies indicate that cabozantinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent for CYP2C9.   
In the clinical XL184-006 study cabozantinib AUCs were decreased by 76% - 77% following co-
administration with the strong CYP3A inducer rifampin compared to cabozantinib alone. When co-
administered with rifampin, the apparent oral clearance of cabozantinib was 4.3-fold higher than for 
cabozantinib alone. These results confirm that rifampin affects the PK of cabozantinib leading to 
significantly lower plasma cabozantinib exposure levels. Other strong inducers of CYP3A4 activity (eg. 
phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital) may also increase metabolism of cabozantinib and 
reduce cabozantinib plasma concentrations potentially leading to decreased efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 84/107 
 
  
  
When cabozantinib was co-administered with ketoconazole in another clinical study, the mean plasma 
t½ of cabozantinib increased from 122 hours to 144 hours. Together with the lower apparent oral 
clearance of cabozantinib of 29%, these results confirm that ketoconazole affects the PK of 
cabozantinib leading to significantly higher plasma cabozantinib exposure levels. Other strong 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. itraconazole, erythromycin) may also decrease metabolism of 
cabozantinib and might increase cabozantinib plasma concentrations potentially leading to increased 
toxicity. 
No effect of mild renal impairment on clearance of cabozantinib was observed by PK analysis. Patients 
with moderate and severe renal impairment were excluded from clinical studies performed with 
cabozantinib to date, therefore no conclusion can be drawn over the PK of cabozantinib in patients 
with moderate or severe renal impairment. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the pivotal study XL184-301, 16.4% of patients discontinued study treatment. Adverse events that 
frequently led to discontinuation of cabozantinib were hypocalcaemia (1.4%) and PPE syndrome 
(1.4%). Overall, 79.0% and 72.0% of patients required dose reductions and interruptions, 
respectively, due to TEAEs. Forty-one percent (41%) of patients required two dose reductions due to 
toxicity. The median time to first dose reduction was 43 days, and to first dose interruption was 33 
days. Close monitoring of patients is therefore recommended during the first eight weeks of therapy 
(see SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4). 
AEs that led to dose modification occurring at 10% higher frequency in the cabozantinib arm 
compared with the placebo arm were PPE syndrome (28.0% vs 0%); diarrhea (19.2% vs 1.8); fatigue 
(13.1%,2.8%); weight decreased (12.6% vs 0%); decreased appetite, nausea (11.7% vs 0.9% each), 
stomatitis (10.7% vs 0%), and asthenia (10.3% vs 0%). The median time to first  dose reduction or 
interruption in the cabozantinib arm was  43 days and occurred after achievement of steady-state 
concentrations (i.e., by about Day 15). Subjects with higher individual-predicted steady-state AUC of 
cabozantinib experienced earlier dose modifications. However, Although PPE was a frequent reason for 
cabozantinib dose modification, PPE in cabozantinib-treated subjects did not show a marked 
correlation with individual predicted steady-state AUC of cabozantinib. Most grade 3 or higher AEs 
occur with 175 mg of cabozantinib and within the first cycles of treatment. Although many AEs tend to 
be reversible over time with the appropriate dose reductions applied, some AEs like PPE and diarrhea 
only resolve slowly over time and tend to persist,  which will likely negatively influence quality of life 
over a longer period of time. These results further underscore the importance an appropriate dose 
finding to prevent patients receiving a too high starting dose of 175 mg of cabozantinib. 
Post marketing experience 
Due to the recent first in the world US approval of cabozantinib, no post-marketing data for 
cabozantinib have been made available or submitted. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of cabozantinib (Cometriq) was consistent across studies and is typical for a 
small molecule with targeted inhibition of the VEGFR and other tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways: 
hypertension, skin (hand-foot syndrome, rash) and gastrointestinal toxicities (diarrhea, mucositis, 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 85/107 
 
  
  
fistulas, abcesses) were prominent, whereas hematologic toxicities were limited. The most common 
serious adverse reactions associated with cabozantinib are pneumonia, mucosal inflammation, 
hypocalcaemia, dysphagia, dehydration, pulmonary embolism, and hypertension. The most frequent 
adverse reactions of any grade (experienced by at least 20% of patients) included diarrhoea, PPES, 
weight decreased, decreased appetite, nausea, fatigue, dysgeusia, hair colour changes, hypertension, 
stomatitis, constipation, vomiting, mucosal inflammation, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, asthenia, hypocalcaemia, and dysphonia. 
A concern was raised regarding the risk for medication errors given the available tablet strengths of 
20 mg and 80 mg on the one hand and the recommended dose and adjustments (140 mg to be 
adjusted to 100 mg and 60 mg) on the other hand. Additionally, the safety of cabozantinib could be 
improved in case a dose lower than the MTD was considered more clinically appropriate. Depending on 
the results of study XL-184-401, expected to inform on the dose-exposure relationship and the 
clinically recommended dose, more appropriate tablet strengths, if necessary, should be developed by 
the applicant. This was included in the agreed RMP. 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
(see SmPC section 4.8). 
Dose reductions and dose interruptions occurred in 79% and 72%, respectively, of cabozantinib-
treated patients in the pivotal clinical trial. Two dose reductions were required in 41% of patients. The 
median time to first dose reduction was 43 days, and to first dose interruption was 33 days. Close 
monitoring of patients is therefore recommended during the first eight weeks of therapy (see section 
4.2). 
The available analysis of the safety profile of cabozantinib did not include patients with a history of 
hepatic or renal impairment or with ongoing or recent cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, almost 80% 
of patients in the pivotal phase III study was younger than 65 years. This is adequately reflected in 
the SmPC (see section 4.2 and discussion on Clinical pharmacology).  
In the pivotal XL184-301 study, AEs more frequently observed (≥20% difference) with cabozantinib 
compared with placebo were palmar plantar erythrodusesthaesia syndrome (50.0 % vs 1,8%), weight 
loss (47.7% vs 10.1%), hair colour changes (33.6% vs 0.9%), decreases appetite (45.8% vs 15.6%),  
diarrhea (63.1% vs 33.0%), dysgeusia (34.1% vs 5.5%), stomatitis (29.0% vs 2.8%), hypertension 
(29.4% vs 3.7%), vomiting (24.3% vs 1.8%), and nausea (43.0 vs. 21.1). All these AEs were judged 
by the investigator as possibly drug-related. The increased incidence was mainly due to grade 1 and 2 
adverse events. 
Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE; hand foot syndrome) was very common (50.0%; 
12.6% Grade 3, 21.5% Grade 2, and 15.4% Grade 1) in the cabozantinib arm compared to placebo 
(1.8%) in study XL184-301 and led to dose modification in 28% and to drug discontinuation in 1.4% 
of patients. Hypertension occurred more frequently in the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-301 
compared with placebo (29.4% overall, 7.9% grade 3 or 4), consistent with VEGF inhibition by 
cabozantinib.  Five events (2.3%) in the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-301 were reported as SAEs. 
Hypertension led to dose modification and to drug discontinuation in 7.0% and 0.9% of patients, 
respectively. 
Assessment report

Most deaths in the pivotal study were due to disease progression. When analysing, causes of death 
seem to be heterogeneous, and not related to cardiac arrhythmias. However, in spite of the high 
frequencies of dose reductions and the short median time interval patients received 175 mg dose, half 
(11/22) of deaths through 30 days after the last dose in the cabozantinib arm occurred at the highest 
dose level. 
Although the majority of AEs were reported as of grade 1-2 in severity, almost 80% of patients 
required a 1-level dose reduction (from 175 mg qd to 125 mg cabozantinib qd), whereas in 41% of 
patients a 2-level dose reduction (to 75 mg) was necessary to manage AEs. PPE was the most 
frequent reason for dose reductions, a clinical syndrome which highly impacts patient’s quality of life, 
even at low grades of severity. Consistent with these large amounts of dose reductions, the mean 
level of exposure was 125 mg in the pivotal XL184-301 study. 
Serious GI perforations and fistulas, sometimes fatal, and intra-abdominal abscesses have been 
observed with cabozantinib. Patients who have had recent radiotherapy, have inflammatory bowel 
disease (e.g., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, peritonitis, or diverticulitis), have tumour infiltration 
of trachea, bronchi, or oesophagus, have complications from prior GI surgery (particularly when 
associated with delayed or incomplete healing), or have complications from prior radiation therapy to 
the thoracic cavity (including mediastinum) should be carefully evaluated before initiating cabozantinib 
therapy and subsequently they should be monitored closely for symptoms of perforations and fistulas. 
Non-GI fistula should be ruled out as appropriate in cases of onset of mucositis after start of therapy. 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who experience a GI perforation or a GI or non-GI 
fistula (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Events of venous thromboembolism and events of arterial thromboembolism have been observed with 
cabozantinib. Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a 
history of, these events. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects who develop an acute 
myocardial infarction or any other clinically significant arterial thromboembolic complication (see 
SmPC section 4.4). 
Hemorrhage has been observed with cabozantinib. Patients who have evidence of involvement of the 
trachea or bronchi by tumour or a history of haemoptysis prior to treatment initiation should be 
carefully evaluated before initiating cabozantinib therapy. Cabozantinib should not be administered to 
patients with serious haemorrhage or recent haemoptysis (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Wound complications have been observed with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib treatment should be 
stopped at least 28 days prior to scheduled surgery, if possible. The decision to resume cabozantinib 
therapy after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. Cabozantinib 
should be discontinued in patients with wound healing complications requiring medical intervention 
(see SmPC section 4.4). 
Hypertension has been observed with cabozantinib. All patients should be monitored for hypertension 
and treated as needed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. In the case of persistent hypertension 
despite use of anti-hypertensives, the cabozantinib dose should be reduced. Cabozantinib should be 
discontinued if hypertension is severe and persistent despite anti-hypertensive therapy and dose 
reduction of cabozantinib.  In case of hypertensive crisis, cabozantinib should be discontinued (see 
SmPC section 4.4).

Events of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) have been observed with cabozantinib. An oral examination 
should be performed prior to initiation of cabozantinib and periodically during cabozantinib therapy. 
Patients should be advised regarding oral hygiene practice. For invasive dental procedures, 
cabozantinib treatment should be held at least 28 days prior to scheduled surgery, if possible. Caution 
should be used in patients receiving agents associated with ONJ, such as bisphosphonates. 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who experience ONJ (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Proteinuria has been observed with cabozantinib.  Urine protein should be monitored regularly during 
cabozantinib treatment. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who develop nephrotic 
syndrome (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), also known as Posterior Reversible 
Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) has been observed with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib treatment 
should be discontinued in patients with RPLS (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, 
patients who are taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, 
bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances. When using cabozantinib, periodic monitoring with on-
treatment ECGs and electrolytes (serum calcium, potassium, and magnesium) should be considered. 
Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, which may increase cabozantinib plasma 
concentrations, should be used with caution (see SmPC section 4.4). 
No specific dose adjustment for the use of cabozantinib in older people (≥ 65 years) is recommended. 
However, a trend in increased rate of SAEs has been observed in subjects aged 75 years and older 
(see SmPC section 4.2). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Management of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption and/or dose 
reduction of Cometriq therapy. Dose reductions are adequately described in the SmPC (see section 
4.2). When dose reduction is necessary, it is recommended to reduce to 100 mg daily, taken as one 
80 mg orange capsule and one 20 mg grey capsule, and then to 60 mg daily, taken as three 20 mg 
grey capsules. Dose interruptions are recommended for management of CTCAE grade 3 or greater 
toxicities or intolerable grade 2 toxicities. Dose reductions are recommended for events that, if 
persistent, could become serious or intolerable. As most events can occur early in the course of 
treatment, the physician should evaluate the patient closely during the first eight weeks of treatment 
to determine if dose modifications are warranted. Events that generally have early onset include 
hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome (PPES), and gastrointestinal (GI) events (abdominal or mouth pain, mucosal inflammation, 
constipation, diarrhoea, vomiting. The occurrence of some serious adverse events (like GI fistula) 
might be dependent on the cumulative dose and might present in a later stage of treatment. If a 
patient misses a dose, the missed dose should not be taken if it is less than 12 hours before the next 
dose. There is limited data in patients with cardiac impairment. No specific dosing recommendations 
can be made (see SmPC section 4.2). 
There is no specific treatment for cabozantinib overdose and possible symptoms of overdose have not 
been established. In the event of suspected overdose, cabozantinib should be withheld and supportive 
care instituted. Metabolic clinical laboratory parameters should be monitored at least weekly or as 
Assessment report

deemed clinically appropriate to assess any possible changing trends. Adverse reactions associated 
with overdose are to be treated symptomatically (see SmPC section 4.9). 
Cabozantinib has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions such 
as fatigue and weakness have been associated with cabozantinib.  Therefore, caution should be 
recommended when driving or operating machines (see SmPC section 4.7). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The toxicity profile was considered acceptable. Overall, the safety profile of cabozantinib (Cometriq) 
was consistent across studies and typical for a small molecule with targeted inhibition of the VEGFR 
and other (MET, RET) tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways: hypertension, skin (hand-foot syndrome, 
rash) and gastrointestinal toxicities (diarrhea, mucositis, fistulas, abcesses) were prominent, whereas 
hematologic toxicities were limited.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
•  A dose-comparison study (XL-184-401) (140 mg vs 60 mg) in patients with hereditary or 
sporadic medullary thyroid cancer. 
Patients with both sporadic and hereditary forms of MTC will be eligible for the study. Fresh tumor 
tissue samples will be required from all enrolled subjects, and guidelines will be provided to 
maximize tissue quality. Samples will undergo thorough evaluation for RET and RAS mutations. 
Tumor tissue samples initially will undergo histological evaluation, manual tumor enrichment, and 
DNA isolation. The resulting DNA samples will be evaluated for quality by a PCR-based amplification 
test, and by Sanger sequencing for RET M918T. A replacement sample will be requested if an original 
sample fails during the PCR quality or the Sanger sequencing tests. Next generation sequencing of 
RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16 will be performed, which covers the vast majority of known RET 
mutations. In addition, samples will be evaluated for mutations in RAS gene hotspots (HRAS, KRAS, 
and NRAS genes). 
PK assessments will be required for all subjects (both dose groups). Results will be used to evaluate 
the exposure to cabozantinib at the 60 and 140 mg dose levels and to further characterize the 
population PK models and exposure response relationships of cabozantinib and possible metabolites 
in this population.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 89/107 
 
  
  
PRAC Advice 
The PRAC agreed to the safety concerns identified in the submitted RMP. Moreover, the PRAC, 
having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation PhV 
development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. 
The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures. 
Finally, the PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes. More specifically, a study to address interactions with 
individual drug transporters (XL184-NC-043) and dose-exposure relationship information from the 
Specific Obligation XL184-NC-401 study to address the potential for medication errors were added 
to the RMP. Moreover, amendments to milestones of studies included in the RMP, based on more 
accurate estimation of expected results, were proposed by the applicant after the final PRAC advice 
and considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The finally agreed content of the Risk Management Plan is as follows:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The evidence of efficacy of cabozantinib in patients with MTC is based on the results of one pivotal 
study (XL184-301), supported by the data of the expansion cohort of the phase I XL184-001 study, 
enrolling 25 patients with MTC. 
Study XL184-301 was a pivotal, phase III, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double blind, 
placebo-controlled study. A total of 330 patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic 
MTC, experiencing disease progression within 14 months from previous radiological assessment, were 
randomized (2:1) to receive oral cabozantinib 175 mg qd (as L-malate salt weight; 138 mg freebase 
equivalent weight) or matching placebo. The population enrolled in the pivotal study reflects the target 
population as mentioned by the wording of the proposed indication. However, patients with locally 
advanced MTC represented < 5% of patients enrolled in the pivotal study. 
The results, based on the final PFS analysis (IRC determined, according to modified RECIST criteria) 
as performed after 139 (42.1%) events, show a statistically significant improvement in the primary 
endpoint of PFS for cabozantinib compared with placebo (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.19-0.49, p<0.0001), 
with a gain in median PFS of 31.2 weeks (7.2 months) in favour of cabozantinib (median PFS 48.6 
weeks vs 17.4 weeks, respectively). The PFS effect was maintained in several subgroups of the 
population, with the exception of patients with RET negative tumors, where the effect did not reach 
statistical significance.  
Objective response rate (ORR: CR+PR, IRC assessed) was significantly higher with cabozantinib 
(27.9%) compared with placebo (0%). Disease stabilization rate was also significantly higher in the 
cabozantinib arm compared with the placebo arm (55.3% vs 13.5%, respectively).  
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 100/107 
 
  
  
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
A trend toward PFS benefit was observed in the RET negative group, but results were not statistically 
significant and therefore the magnitude of clinical benefit should be further confirmed. Study XL-184-
401 will be conducted to address this issue. Fresh tumor tissue samples will be required from all 
enrolled subjects, and guidelines will be provided to maximize tissue quality (see discussion on Clinical 
Efficacy and Discussion on the benefit-risk balance). 
The interim OS analysis, performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis and including 96 (29%) of 
death events did not show any significant difference between the two study arms (HR 0.98, 95% CI 
0.63-1.52, p=0.9304, median OS 21.1 months vs NA with cabozantinib and placebo, respectively). 
The updated OS analysis also showed no significant difference between the two study arms. This 
should be confirmed in a more mature dataset and increased power to detect any differences. Final OS 
results will be provided according to agreed timelines (see discussion on Clinical Efficacy and 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance).  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of cabozantinib (Cometriq) was consistent across studies and is typical for 
a small molecule with targeted inhibition of the VEGFR and other (MET, RET) tyrosine kinase-
mediated pathways: hypertension, skin (hand-foot syndrome, rash) and gastrointestinal toxicities 
(diarrhea, mucositis, fistulas, abcesses) were prominent, whereas hematologic toxicities were 
limited.  
In the pivotal XL184-301 study, AEs more frequently observed (≥20% difference) with cabozantinib 
compared with placebo were palmar plantar erythrodysesthaesia (PPE) syndrome (50.0 % vs. 
1,8%), weight loss (47.7% vs. 10.1%), hair colour changes (33.6% vs. 0.9%), decreased appetite 
(45.8% vs. 15.6%), diarrhoea (63.1% vs. 33.0%), dysgeusia (34.1% vs. 5.5%), stomatitis (29.0% 
vs. 2.8%), hypertension (29.4% vs. 3.7%), vomiting (24.3% vs. 1.8%), and nausea (43.0 vs. 21.1). 
The most common serious adverse reactions associated with cabozantinib were pneumonia, mucosal 
inflammation, hypocalcaemia, dysphagia, dehydration, pulmonary embolism, and hypertension. The 
most frequent adverse reactions of any grade (experienced by at least 20% of patients) included 
diarrhoea, PPES, weight decreased, decreased appetite, nausea, fatigue, dysgeusia, hair colour 
changes, hypertension, stomatitis, constipation, vomiting, mucosal inflammation, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increased, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, asthenia, 
hypocalcaemia, and dysphonia. 
A thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value above normal after first dose was observed in 57% of 
patients on cabozantinib versus 19% of patients on placebo (regardless of baseline values). Ninety-
two percent of patients on the cabozantinib arm had a prior thyroidectomy, and 89% were taking 
thyroid hormones prior to first dose. 
The cardiac toxicity of cabozantinib was mild. A mild to moderate increase of mean QTcF at day 29 
(where steady state plasma concentrations of cabozantinib have been reached) of 10 msec from 
baseline was observed at a dose of 140 mg qd, which was considered not clinically relevant. ECG 
assessments in the pivotal study indicated that cabozantinib can cause QT prolongation, with a mean 
QTcF change from baseline of 9.7 ms on Day 29 of treatment. One patient had a QTcF prolongation

of >60ms, and 2 patients were identified with a new QTcF >480 ms. This effect was not associated 
with a change in cardiac wave form morphology or new rhythms. 
According to the MDASI THY score, several cancer related symptoms (like gastrointestinal 
symptoms), were significantly more frequently observed and with greater severity in the 
cabozantinib versus the placebo arm, indicating a detrimental effect of cabozantinib compared with 
placebo in terms of quality of life, possibly related to the toxicity of the drug. 
Overall, almost 80% of cabozantinib-treated patients needed one and 41% required two dose 
reductions due to toxicity. The main AEs leading to dose reductions were PPE, weight decrease, 
decreased appetite, fatigue, diarrhea, stomatitis, asthenia and nausea. Discontinuation occurred in 
16.4% of patients. Due to the dose reductions, the median overall exposure in the pivotal XL184-
301 study was 100 mg instead of the proposed 140 mg. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
From a methodological point of view the dose selection is considered acceptable as based on the 
results of the phase I XL184-001 study, employing a classical dose finding approach. However, only 
two dose levels (175 mg and 250 mg OD) have been evaluated with the capsule formulation. In view 
of such findings, further data should confirm if the benefit-risk balance cannot be improved using a 
lower dose. The XL-184-401 study, is expected to further clarify the safety-exposure relationship 
(see Discussion on Clinical efficacy and Clinical safety). 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Metastatic MTC is a highly invalidating and life threatening condition. Despite the possibility of 
protracted course of disease, patients with metastatic MTC will invariably experience disease 
progression and the great majority die from the disease: median overall survival in patients with 
metastatic and progressive disease is about 2-3 years.  
In the metastatic setting patients may be affected by several symptoms related to local disease 
(dysphagia, neck pain, swallowing problems) and to systemic release of calcitonin or other factors 
(diarrhoea, flushing, fatigue, Cushing syndrome) or to metastatic localization (e.g., pain related to 
bone metastases, fistulas forming, etc.). Treatments goals in the metastatic setting essentially aim 
to improve survival and/or delay disease progression when associated with reduction of disease 
related symptoms and/or improvement in quality of life.  
There are limited treatment options available for patients with metastatic MTC: cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (as monotherapy or as combination regimens) has been administered in the past 
decades with disappointing results, consisting of low rate of tumour response and remarkable 
toxicity. 
In 2012, vandetanib, an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor of RET, EGFR and VEGFR, has been 
approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic MTC. Approval 
has been limited to patients with aggressive and symptomatic disease. Treatment with vandetanib 
was associated in particular with significant QT prolongation with related risk of torsade de pointes 
and other arrhythmias.  
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 102/107 
 
  
  
In this context the results of the pivotal XL184-301 study, showing a high level of efficacy in terms 
of PFS and an acceptable toxicity profile, without significant QT prolongation, are considered of 
clinical relevance.  
Benefit-risk balance 
From a regulatory perspective (CPMP/EWP/2330/99), licensing based on the results of one single 
pivotal study is acceptable if the study is particularly compelling with respect to internal and external 
validity, clinical relevance, statistical significance, data quality, and internal consistency. The efficacy 
results of the XL184-301 study show a robust and statistically significant improvement in PFS 
associated with treatment with cabozantinib (median gain 7.2 months), which is considered of 
clinical relevance. The toxicity profile is considered acceptable and the benefit-risk balance is 
considered to be positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
As the precise mechanism of action of cabozantinib on the RET tyrosine kinase remains unclear, the 
impact of RET mutation status on the efficacy of cabozantinib needs to be further ascertained in a 
dose comparative study (XL-184-401). In addition to this, the same study will address possibility of 
giving effective lower dosages with less toxicity.  
Following consultation with the applicant, the CHMP considered the granting of a conditional 
marketing authorisation for cabozantinib in accordance with Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 507/2006.  
Cabozantinib  aims at the treatment of seriously debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases and 
therefore falls within the scope of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006. In addition, Cometriq 
was designated as an orphan medicinal product. 
The Committee found that although comprehensive clinical data referring to the efficacy of the 
medicinal product had not been supplied, all of the following requirements were met: 
• 
The risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 
2001/83/EC, is positive 
In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study presented in patients with progressive, 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (XL184-301), a statistically 
significant improvement in the primary endpoint of PFS was shown for cabozantinib compared with 
placebo (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.19-0.49, p<0.0001), with a gain in median PFS of 31.2 weeks (7.2 
months) in favour of cabozantinib (median PFS 48.6 weeks vs 17.4 weeks, respectively).  
From a quantitative point of view, the specific benefit in patients with RET negative tumours or 
tumours with unknown RET mutation status was less as compared with what was observed in 
patients with RET+ tumours. The possible lower beneficial effects of cabozantinib in patients in 
whom RET mutation are not known or is negative has been included in the indication and further 
information is warranted to clarify this further.  
The toxicity profile was considered acceptable. However, in view of the frequent dose reductions due 
to toxicity, the benefit-risk balance might be further improved by studying the efficacy and safety of 
a lower starting dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/97103/2014 
Page 103/107 
 
  
  
In summary, the benefit/ risk is considered positive. The possibility of giving effective lower dosages 
with less toxicity needs to be explored further. Also, the impact of the RET status on the efficacy 
needs to be further ascertained in the dose comparative study XL-184-401 by establishing the RET 
status in the patients enrolled. 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide comprehensive clinical data 
The applicant has provided an outline of the proposed dose-comparison study (XL-184-401) (140 mg 
vs 60 mg) in patients with hereditary or sporadic medullary thyroid cancer. Patients with both 
sporadic and hereditary forms of MTC will be eligible for the study. Fresh tumor tissue samples will 
be required from all enrolled subjects, and guidelines will be provided to maximize tissue quality. 
Samples will undergo thorough evaluation for RET and RAS mutations. Tumor tissue samples initially 
will undergo histological evaluation, manual tumor enrichment, and DNA isolation. The resulting DNA 
samples will be evaluated for quality by a PCR-based amplification test, and by Sanger sequencing 
for RET M918T. A replacement sample will be requested if an original sample fails during the PCR 
quality or the Sanger sequencing tests. Next generation sequencing of RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16 
will be performed, which covers the vast majority of known RET mutations. In addition, samples will 
be evaluated for mutations in RAS gene hotspots (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS genes). 
PK assessments will be required for all subjects (both dose groups). Results will be used to evaluate 
the exposure to cabozantinib at the 60 and 140 mg dose levels and to further characterize the 
population PK models and exposure response relationships of cabozantinib and possible 
metabolite(s) in this population. The general features of the study design are considered acceptable 
and feasible; applicant has provided significant assurance that the trial will be conducted according 
to agreed timelines. Therefore is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide 
comprehensive clinical data. 
•  Unmet medical needs to be fulfilled  
There is only one approved medicinal product (vandetanib) for MTC patients with aggressive 
progressive disease. Although a direct efficacy comparison is not available, the effect on PFS 
associated with cabozantinib was broadly comparable to the effect observed with vandetanib. 
However, vandetanib is associated with a clinical relevant QTc prolongation. Cabozantinib was 
associated with clinically relevant efficacy in terms of PFS and an acceptable toxicity profile, without 
significant QTc prolongation. In the subset of patients with aggressive progressive disease, in view of 
the improved safety profile as regards QTc prolongation, cabozantinib is considered to fulfil an unmet 
need by providing an alternative treatment with a different safety profile.  
There are no medicinal products approved for treatment of MTC in patients with less symptomatic 
disease (i.e., in the absence of “aggressive” progressive disease).  
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that cabozantinib will fulfil unmet needs. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal 
product  concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still 
required 
The CHMP considered that the potential risks inherent in marketing cabozantinib for the specific 
indication, while additional, more comprehensive data becomes available in the future, is offset by 
the potential benefit to the patients whose only treatment options currently available are surgery

and vandetanib. The RMP for cabozantinib is considered adequate to address any identified and 
unknown risks.  
The CHMP concluded that all the requirements for the granting of a conditional marketing 
authorisation had been met.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Cometriq in the treatment of adult patients with progressive, 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma [for patients in whom 
Rearranged during Transfection (RET) mutation status is not known or is negative, a possible lower 
benefit should be taken into account before individual treatment decision (see important 
information in sections 4.4 and 5.1)] is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the 
conditional marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

Patients with both sporadic and hereditary forms of MTC will be eligible for the 
study. Fresh tumour samples for tumour genetic analysis from the most recent 
metastatic site in patients enrolled in the dose-comparison study should be 
collected. 
Samples will undergo thorough evaluation for RET and RAS mutations. Tumor 
tissue samples initially will undergo histological evaluation, manual tumor 
enrichment, and DNA isolation. The resulting DNA samples will be evaluated 
for quality by a PCR-based amplification test, and by Sanger sequencing for 
RET M918T. A replacement sample will be requested if an original sample fails 
during the PCR quality or the Sanger sequencing tests. Next generation 
sequencing of RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16 will be performed, which covers 
the vast majority of known RET mutations. In addition, samples will be 
evaluated for mutations in RAS gene hotspots (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS 
genes). 
PK assessments will be required for all subjects (both dose groups). Results 
will be used to evaluate the exposure to cabozantinib at the 60 and 140 mg 
dose levels and to further characterize the population PK models and exposure 
response relationships of cabozantinib and possible metabolites in this 
population.

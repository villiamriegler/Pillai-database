Update of the RMP to replace the prospective 
14/05/2020 
n/a 
Study SB2-G42-CD was included as a category 3 PASS at 
observational cohort study of Flixabi in patients with 
Crohn's disease (CD) (SB2-G42-CD), with real-world 
data from CREDIT and CEDUR studies. 
C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the 
obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of 
change(s) which require to be further substantiated 
by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH 
where significant assessment is required 
the time of marketing authorisation of this infliximab 
biosimilar, in order to monitor the efficacy, safety and 
immunogenicity (potential risk of loss of efficacy due to 
ADA development of Flixabi) in CD patients. The MAH 
argued that the value of SB2-G42-CD study needed to be 
reconsidered with prudent evaluation of the currently 
available and future Flixabi study and real-world data. The 
MAH evaluated data available to date, including 78-week 
extension phase data from the phase 3 pivotal clinical study 
(SB2-G31-RA), data from the company safety database, 
and real-world data from post-approval studies. Results 
from the 78-week extension phase of SB2-G31-RA 
demonstrated maintenance of efficacy among the three 
Page 7/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment groups (SB2/SB2 vs Remicade/Remicade vs 
Remicade/SB2). In addition, analyses on the data from the 
company safety database regarding immunogenicity did not 
suggest an increased risk of Flixabi as the frequencies of 
major AEs related to immunogenicity were comparable to 
those of other infliximab products. From the data from the 
post-approval studies, there was no evidence indicating 
increased immunogenicity or decreased efficacy after 
switching to Flixabi from other infliximab.  
The quality and quantity of study and real-world data for 
Flixabi are considered adequate to replace the previously 
proposed SB2-G42-CD study comparing the 
immunogenicity and efficacy between Flixabi and Remicade 
in 200 patients with CD (100 per group) over 104 weeks. 
CEDUR and CREDIT registries, enrolling IBD patients using 
TNF alpha inhibitor, recently have been approved to be 
included in Flixabi RMP as PASS. Even though ADA level is 
not available in the two registries, immunogenicity-related 
efficacy and majority of AE/SAEs in IBD patients will be 
collected and analysed in both registries. Upon completion 
of CEDUR and CREDIT registries, 5-year or more long-term 
real-world data of Flixabi in safety and efficacy will be 
obtainable. Therefore, the CHMP endorsed that SB2-G42-
CD study could be replaced by submitting the final reports 
of the two currently RMP-committed ongoing PASS: CREDIT 
and CEDUR both conducted in IBD patients.

Data up to week 54 from study SB2-G31-RA was submitted 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
as part of the initial Marketing Authorisation. The MAH has 
submitted with this variation data from the extension phase 
up to week 78. 
Subjects were enrolled in the transition-extension period 
for up to 24 weeks after Week 54 of the randomised, 
Page 17/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
double-blind period. At Week 54, subjects receiving 
Remicade® from the randomised, double-blind period of 
the SB2-G31-RA study were randomised again in a 1:1 
ratio to either continue on Remicade® 
(Remicade®/Remicade® = 101 patients) or be transitioned 
to SB2 (Remicade®/SB2 = 94 ) up to Week 70 and this 
was compared to patients that remained on SB2 (= 201 
Patients).  
The trial was powered for ACR 20 comparison and this 
measure is of importance when looking at long term 
therapeutic effect. The observed ACR 20 at 78 weeks  of  
68.3%  (SB2/SB2) vs 68.8% (R/R) vs 63.5% (R/S) values 
are comparable between the three arms in the per-protocol 
analyses, and  there are still considerable number of 
patients in follow up with only 15 % attrition, so results 
were considered relevant.  
The observed ACR 50 at 78 weeks was 40.6% (SB2/SB2) 
vs 47.3 (R/R) vs 37.6% (R/S) values are comparable 
between the three arms. The observed ACR 70 at 78 weeks 
was 25.6% (SB2/SB2) vs 31.2 (R/R) vs 22.4% (R/S) 
values are comparable between the three arms with minor 
differences likely reflecting assay variability in the range of 
what has been observed before. 
It is notable that patients who were switched from 
Remicade to SB2 (R/S) consistently (= ACR 20, 50 and 70) 
fare somewhat worse in the order of -5 to -10% for week 
70 and week 78 data. On the other hand, the R/S  patients 
had better ACR 20,50 and 70 measurements for weeks 54 
and 62 in the range of + 2 to + 6%, so  variation in the 
range of up to 10%  could also be a chance finding. 
The ACR 20 time response curves demonstrate 
maintenance of therapeutic efficacy over the observed time 
Page 18/23 
 
 
 
 
 
period of 78 weeks which indicates biosimilarity and also no 
adverse effect of switching. 
The secondary endpoints ACR-N, EULAR response and also 
DAS28 all indicate maintained efficacy at week 78 in a 
similar range for SB2 and Remicade, regardless of 
switching: 
In the SB2/SB2 treatment group, the mean change in 
DAS28 score from Week 0 to Week 78 was 2.6189 and 
from Week 54 to Week 78 was 0.1262.The mean change in 
DAS28 score from Week 0 to Week 78 was 2.5228 in the 
Remicade®/SB2 treatment group and 2.5844 in the 
Remicade®/Remicade® treatment group. The mean 
change in DAS28 score from Week 54 to Week 78 was 
−0.1226 in the Remicade®/SB2 treatment group and 
0.1238 in the Remicade®/Remicade® treatment group. 
Regarding immunogenicity, there is still a difference of 
about 4 to 7% more ADA positive patients at later time 
points (62, 70, 78 weeks) when treating with SB2 as 
compared to Remicade only. Up to Week 78, there is no 
statistically significant or clinically meaningful difference 
between treatment groups in the proportion of subjects 
with ADA positive results against SB2. Interestingly, 
patients who were switched from Remicade to SB2 seem to 
be less frequently ADA positive, e.g.: at week 78 SB2 
(S/S): 47.1% versus R/S:38.5% versus R/R: 40.4%   
which would support the view that any seemingly negative 
effects on efficacy parameters are not due to ADAs. 
However with the lack of any other reasonable explanation 
on the quality level, this data indicates that differences in 
ADA positivity observed at the 10% level, may be due to 
normal variability, which are not considered clinically 
meaningful.  
Page 19/23 
 
 
 
 
 
Also, there is no unidirectional trend of therapeutic effect 
with % patients who are ADA positive, e.g. ACR 50 levels 
at 78 weeks demonstrate effect for S/S 40.6% vs R/R 
47.3% vs R/S 37.6%  but the ADA positive rate is 66.2%; 
62.8% vs 61.5%, respectively. 
In conclusion, up to Week 78, there is no statistically 
significant or clinically meaningful difference between 
treatment groups in the proportion of subjects with ADA 
positive results against SB2:. Furthermore, (a) there is no 
clear pattern of differences regarding efficacy parameters 
of switched and unswitched patients  (ACR 20, 50,70) and 
(b) there is no unidirectional trend of therapeutic effect for 
switched versus unswitched patients who are ADA positive 
plus (c) the treatment effect is maintained at the overall 
population level (i.e. all patients, irrespective of ADA 
positivity).  
In summary, the efficacy variables for the transition-
extension period (ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response, 
continuous ACR-N, change of DAS28 score from Week 0 
and EULAR response) were generally comparable between 
the SB2/SB2, Remicade®/SB2 and Remicade®/Remicade® 
treatment groups and the observed differences in 
immunogenicity may likely be viewed as minor and not 
clinically meaningful. 
These findings are in support of previous findings observed 
at week 30 and week 54, regardless of switching.

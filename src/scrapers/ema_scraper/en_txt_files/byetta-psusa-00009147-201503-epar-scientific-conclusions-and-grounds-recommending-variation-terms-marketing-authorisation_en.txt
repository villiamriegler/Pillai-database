Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for exenatide, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
Data presented in this PSUR show that the incidence for exenatide containing products has changed for 
the following adverse events: anaphylactic reaction, dehydration, somnolence, constipation, flatulence, 
alopecia, pruritus, and/ or urticaria, altered renal function including acute renal failure, worsened 
chronic renal failure, renal impairment, increased serum creatinine, injection site reactions, injection 
site pruritus, injection site rash, weight decreased, vomiting, eructation, macular or popular rash, 
angioedema, international normalized ratio (INR) increased, and acute pancreatitis. Based on the 
review of the reported cases, the PRAC considers that the frequency information for these adverse 
reactions should be updated in the product information. 
Therefore, in view of the available data regarding the above mentioned adverse events, the PRAC 
considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing exenatide were 
warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for exenatide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal products containing exenatide is favourable subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

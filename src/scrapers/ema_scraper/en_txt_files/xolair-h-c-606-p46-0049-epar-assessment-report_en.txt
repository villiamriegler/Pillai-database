Introduction 
On 21 September 2015, the MAH submitted a completed observational study, with paediatric 
patients included, for Xolair (omalizumab), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. 
A clinical overview has been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that “Slovak national registry of paediatric, adolescent and adult patients with 
severe uncontrolled asthma treated with omalizumab” (CIGE025ASK01) is a stand-alone study. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Patients were treated with Xolair at the investigator’s discretion following local standard medical 
practice, local label, and/or reimbursement guidelines in Slovakia.  
Xolair is approved for asthma in patients of 6 years of age and above, as follows: 
‘Xolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE mediated asthma.  
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent 
allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and 
who have reduced lung function (FEV1 <80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time 
awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily 
high dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. 
Children (6 to <12 years of age) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent 
allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and 
frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented 
severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting 
inhaled beta2-agonist.’ 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a clinical overview and final study report for CIGE025ASK01. This study was a 
MAH sponsored non-interventional, observational registry study of paediatric and adult patients 
with severe uncontrolled asthma treated with omalizumab. The purpose of the registry was to 
collect data on the treatment effectiveness, safety, and potential dose adjustment of omalizumab 
in real world practice.  This registry was conducted in Slovakia. The study included six paediatric 
patients (< 18 years) out of 115 patients in total. Last patient last visit was in March 2015.

CHMP comment 
Only six paediatric patients were included in the study. Despite detailed description of safety,  
the paediatric patients were not analysed separately.   
1.3.2.  Clinical study 
CIGE025ASK01 
Description 
Methods 
Objective 
Primary objective: To collect data on real-world effectiveness, safety and use of Xolair therapy in 
patients with uncontrolled persistent allergic asthma. 
Secondary objective: None 
Study design 
This was national multicentre, non-interventional, observational registry study with a follow-up of  
2 years conducted in Slovakia. Paediatric (<18 years of age) and adult patients with uncontrolled 
persistent asthma, who started treatment with Xolair within 4 weeks prior to inclusion in this 
registry, were eligible to participate.  Patient treatment was at the investigator’s discretion 
following local standard medical practice, local label, and/or reimbursement guidelines. Data were 
entered in the registry at 16 weeks, 8 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months after start of 
treatment with Xolair. Global Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness (GETE) was assessed at  
16 weeks and  Asthma Control Test (ACT) every time points. 
CHMP comment on Methods 
The MAH has, in the clinical study report adequately and in detail described the method of the 
study. However, no synopsis of the study has been included. In the future synopsis of studies are 
recommended to be presented in final clinical study reports.  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Data from 115 patients from 38 study centres were collected, and 2 year data was available for  
94 patients. The safety analysis included all 115 patients, and the efficacy analysis included 110 
patients. 
Baseline data 
In total, the average age was 51.2 ± 15.5 years and the mean duration of asthma prior to Xolair 
treatment was 13.6 ± 9.6 years ranging from 1 to 40 years.

Paediatric population 
Six paediatric patients (<18 years) were enrolled. Two patients were younger than 12 years of age, 
and 4 patients were between the ages of 12-17 years old. The youngest patient enrolled was 10 
years old. No paediatric patients discontinued the study.  
CHMP comment 
Only limited information has been given on the paediatric patients at baseline.  
Efficacy results 
GETE 
The efficacy of Xolair was evaluated at Week 16 with the Global Evaluation of Treatment 
Effectiveness (GETE). This evaluation was required as formal approval for patients to continue with 
Xolair treatment; however, only 52 out of 110 (47%) patients at Week 16 had the GETE results 
recorded in the electronic case report forms (eCRF). GETE evaluation at week 16 among the 52 
patients is presented in the table below. 
Table 1. GETE evaluation at week 16 
ACT 
Asthma control was also evaluated based on ACT. The ACT was completed by 62 (56%) patients at 
baseline and was completed by 40% of patients during the follow up period. 
Based on the ACT, 95% of patients had uncontrolled asthma at baseline and this decreased to 19% 
of patients who reported uncontrolled asthma at 24 months. 
CHMP comment 
Only 47% (52/110) of the patients had GETE results recorded at week 16.  The same pattern was 
noticed for assessments of ACT (56% completion at baseline and 40% of the patients during the 
follow-up period). The high amount of missing data of the efficacy parameters at follow-up 
complicates further analysis and conclusions of efficacy results in this study. This is also 
commented by the MAH. 
No efficacy results have been presented separately for the paediatric patients. No conclusions on 
efficacy can therefore be drawn for the paediatric population in this study.  
Safety results 
The MAH concluded that there were no new safety concerns raised in the study.  
Paediatric safety 
Eight AEs were reported in 4 paediatric patients in this study.

•  13 year old male with 2 AEs of head pain and asthma exacerbation, both reported as non-
serious and not suspected 
•  15 year old male with 2 AEs of asthma exacerbation and respiratory infection, both reported as 
non-serious and not suspected 
•  10 year old female with 2 AEs of respiratory infection, both reported as non-serious and not 
suspected 
•  17 year old female with 2 AEs respiratory infection and cough, both reported as non-serious and 
not suspected 
CHMP comment 
The conclusion by the MAH that there were no new safety concerns raised in the study is 
supported. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This registry, observational study included only six paediatric patients. Despite safety results the 
paediatric patients were not assessed separately. Even if separately information regarding baseline 
and efficacy data is lacking for the paediatric patients in this study this will not be requested since 
the amount of patients is limited and adequately data is already available for Zolair in this age 
group.  
However, in the future studies submitted according to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, 
the MAH is recommended describe paediatric patients separately not only from a safety aspect but 
also with baseline and efficacy data . 
As also concluded by the MAH the main limitation of the study is the missing data including 
important fields like GETE or ACT evaluation. Therefore it is difficult to make any conclusions on the 
efficacy results. However, there were no new safety concerns raised in the study and the benefit 
risk ratio remains unchanged.  
2.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The study report has been provided as requested according to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. There were no unexpected findings.  
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rubraca is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced 
(FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer 
who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based 
chemotherapy.

Rubraca is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-
sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are 
in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Rubraca should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Rubraca is 600 mg taken twice daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 
1 200 mg. 
Patients should start the maintenance treatment with Rubraca no later than 8 weeks after completion of 
their final dose of the platinum containing regimen. 
Duration of treatment 
First-line maintenance treatment of advanced ovarian cancer:  
Patients can continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or completion of 
2 years treatment.  
Maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer: 
Patients can continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
If a patient vomits after taking Rubraca, the patient should not retake the dose and should take the next 
scheduled dose. 
Missed doses 
If a dose is missed, the patient should resume taking Rubraca with the next scheduled dose. 
Dose adjustments for adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions may be managed through dose interruptions and/or dose reductions for moderate to 
severe reactions (i.e. CTCAE Grade 3 or 4) such as neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. 
Liver transaminase elevations (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT)) occur early in treatment and are generally transient. Grade 1 to 3 elevations in AST/ALT can 
be managed without change to the rucaparib dose, or with treatment modification (interruption and/or 
dose reduction). Grade 4 reactions require treatment modification (see Table 2). 
Other moderate to severe non-haematological adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting, can be 
managed through dose interruption and/or reductions, if not adequately controlled by appropriate 
symptomatic management.

Special populations 
Elderly 
No adjustment is recommended to the starting dose for elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) (see 
sections 4.8 and 5.2). Greater sensitivity of some elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) to adverse events 
cannot be ruled out. There are limited clinical data in patients aged 75 or over. 
Hepatic impairment 
No starting dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be carefully monitored for hepatic 
function and adverse reactions. There are no clinical data in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(i.e., total bilirubin > 3 times ULN), therefore rucaparib is not recommended for use in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
No starting dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see 
section 5.2). There are no clinical data in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 
30 mL/min), therefore rucaparib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Rucaparib may only be used in patients with severe renal impairment if the potential benefit outweighs 
the risk. Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment should be carefully monitored for renal 
function and adverse reactions. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Rubraca in children or adolescents aged less than 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Rubraca is for oral use and can be taken with or without food. The doses should be taken 
approximately 12 hours apart. See section 5.2. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haematological toxicity 
During treatment with rucaparib, events of myelosuppression (anaemia, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia) may be observed and are typically first observed after 8 to 10 weeks of treatment 
with rucaparib. These reactions are manageable with routine medical treatment and/or dose adjustment 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for more severe cases. Complete blood count testing prior to starting treatment with Rubraca, and 
monthly thereafter, is advised. Patients should not start Rubraca treatment until they have recovered 
from haematological toxicities caused by previous chemotherapy (≤ CTCAE Grade 1). 
Supportive care and institutional guidelines should be implemented for the management of low blood 
counts for the treatment of anaemia and neutropenia. Rubraca should be interrupted or dose reduced 
according to Table 1 (see section 4.2) and blood counts monitored weekly until recovery. If the levels 
have not recovered to CTCAE Grade 1 or better after 4 weeks, the patient should be referred to a 
haematologist for further investigations. 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML), including cases with fatal 
outcome, have been reported in patients who received rucaparib. The duration of therapy with 
rucaparib in patients who developed MDS/AML varied from < 2 months to approximately 6 years. 
If MDS/AML is suspected, the patient should be referred to a haematologist for further investigations, 
including bone marrow analysis and blood sampling for cytogenetics. If, following investigation for 
prolonged haematological toxicity, MDS/AML is confirmed, Rubraca should be discontinued. 
Photosensitivity 
Photosensitivity has been observed in patients treated with rucaparib. Patients should avoid spending 
time in direct sunlight because they may burn more easily during rucaparib treatment; when outdoors, 
patients should wear a hat and protective clothing, and use sunscreen and lip balm with sun protection 
factor (SPF) of 50 or greater. 
Gastrointestinal toxicities 
Gastrointestinal toxicities (nausea and vomiting) are frequently reported with rucaparib, are generally 
low grade (CTCAE Grade 1 or 2) and may be managed with dose reduction (refer to Table 1) or 
interruption. Antiemetics, such as 5-HT3 antagonists, dexamethasone, aprepitant and fosaprepitant, 
can be used as treatment for nausea/vomiting and may also be considered for prophylactic (i.e., 
preventative) use prior to starting Rubraca. It is important to proactively manage these events to avoid 
prolonged or more severe events of nausea/vomiting which have the potential to lead to complications 
such as dehydration or hospitalisation. 
Intestinal obstruction 
Cases of intestinal obstruction have been observed in ovarian cancer patients treated with rucaparib in 
clinical trials; 3.5% of patients treated with rucaparib experienced a serious event of intestinal 
obstruction, with a fatal outcome in 1 rucaparib treated patient (less than 0.1%). The underlying 
disease may play a role in the development of intestinal obstruction in patients with ovarian cancer. In 
the event of suspected intestinal obstruction, a prompt diagnostic evaluation should be conducted and 
the patient should be treated appropriately. 
Embryofoetal toxicity 
Rubraca can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of 
action and findings from animal studies. In an animal reproduction study, administration of rucaparib 
to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-foetal toxicity at exposures 
below those in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 600 mg twice daily (see 
section 5.3). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy/contraception 
Pregnant women should be informed of the potential risk to a foetus. Women of reproductive potential 
should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last 
dose of Rubraca (see section 4.6). A pregnancy test before initiating treatment is recommended in 
women of reproductive potential. 
Excipients 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on rucaparib 
Enzymes responsible for rucaparib metabolism have not been identified. Based on in vitro data, 
CYP2D6, and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, were able to metabolize rucaparib. 
Although in vitro rucaparib metabolism mediated by CYP3A4 was slow, a significant contribution of 
CYP3A4 in vivo cannot be excluded. Caution should be used for concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors or inducers. 
In vitro, rucaparib was shown to be a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. Effect of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors 
on rucaparib PK cannot be ruled out. Caution is recommended when rucaparib is co-administered with 
medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of P-gp. 
Effects of rucaparib on other medicinal products 
In medicinal product interaction studies in cancer patients, the effects of steady-state rucaparib at 
600 mg twice daily on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, BCRP and P-gp were evaluated with 
single oral doses of sensitive probes (caffeine, S-warfarin, omeprazole, midazolam, rosuvastatin, and 
digoxin, respectively). The effect of rucaparib on the pharmacokinetics of the combined oral 
contraceptive (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) was also evaluated. Data suggest that rucaparib is a 
moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2, and a mild inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. Rucaparib 
also marginally inhibits P-gp and weakly inhibits BCRP in the gut. 
CYP1A2 substrates 
Rucaparib showed no effect on Cmax of caffeine while moderately increasing AUCinf of caffeine by 
2.55 fold (90% CI: 2.12, 3.08). When co-administering medicinal products metabolized by CYP1A2, 
particularly medicines which have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., tizanidine, theophylline), dose 
adjustments may be considered based on appropriate clinical monitoring. 
CYP2C9 substrates 
Rucaparib increased S-warfarin Cmax by 1.05 fold (90% CI: 0.99 to 1.12) and AUC0-96 h by 1.49 fold 
(90% CI: 1.40 to 1.58), respectively. When co-administering medicinal products that are CYP2C9 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin, phenytoin), dose adjustments may be 
considered, if clinically indicated. Caution should be exercised and additional International 
Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring with co-administration of warfarin and therapeutic drug level 
monitoring of phenytoin should be considered, if used concomitantly with rucaparib. 
CYP2C19 substrates 
Rucaparib increased omeprazole Cmax by 1.09 fold (90% CI: 0.93 to 1.27) and AUCinf by 1.55 fold 
(90% CI: 1.32 to 1.83). The risk for a clinically relevant effect of concomitant administration of proton 
pump inhibitors (PPIs) is likely small (see section 5.2). No dose adjustment is considered necessary 
for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP2C19 substrates. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CYP3A substrates 
Rucaparib increased midazolam Cmax by 1.13 fold (90% CI: 0.95 to 1.36) and AUCinf by 1.38 fold 
(90% CI: 1.13 to 1.69). Caution is advised when co-administering medicinal products that are CYP3A 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, astemizole, cisapride, cyclosporine, 
dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, terfenadine). 
Dose adjustments may be considered, if clinically indicated based on observed adverse reactions.  
Oral contraceptives 
Rucaparib increased ethinylestradiol Cmax by 1.09 fold (90% CI: 0.94 to 1.27) and AUClast by 1.43 fold 
(90% CI: 1.15 to 1.77). Rucaparib increased levonorgestrel Cmax by 1.19 fold (90% CI: 1.00 to 1.42) 
and AUClast by 1.56 fold (90% CI: 1.33 to 1.83). No dose adjustment is recommended for co-
administered oral contraceptives. 
BCRP substrates 
Rucaparib increased rosuvastatin Cmax by 1.29 fold (90% CI: 1.07 to 1.55) and AUCinf by 1.35 fold 
(90% CI: 1.17 to 1.57). No dose adjustment is recommended for co-administered medicinal products 
that are BCRP substrates. 
P-gp substrates 
Rucaparib showed no effect on Cmax of digoxin while marginally increasing AUC0-72 h by 1.20 fold 
(90% CI: 1.12 to 1.29). No dose adjustment is recommended for co-administered medicinal products 
that are P-gp substrates. 
Interaction of rucaparib with other enzymes and transporter was evaluated in vitro. Rucaparib is a 
weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and UGT1A1. Rucaparib down regulated CYP2B6 in human 
hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. Rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of MATE1 and 
MATE2-K, a moderate inhibitor of OCT1, and a weak inhibitor of OCT2. As inhibition of these 
transporters could decrease metformin renal elimination and decrease liver uptake of metformin, 
caution is advised when metformin is co-administered with rucaparib. The clinical relevance of 
UGT1A1 inhibition by rucaparib is not clear. Caution should be used when rucaparib is co-
administered with UGT1A1 substrates (i.e. irinotecan) to patients with UGT1A1*28 (poor 
metabolizer) due to a possible increase in the exposure of SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) 
and associated toxicities. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving 
rucaparib. Patients should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months 
following the last dose of rucaparib (see section 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited data from the use of rucaparib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Based on its mechanism of action and preclinical data, 
rucaparib may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rubraca should not be used 
during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with rucaparib. A 
pregnancy test before initiating treatment is recommended in women of reproductive potential. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no animal studies on the excretion of rucaparib in breast milk. It is unknown whether 
rucaparib/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. Rubraca must not be used during breast-feeding. 
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants from rucaparib, 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
breast-feeding is contraindicated during treatment with Rubraca and for 2 weeks after the final dose 
(see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of rucaparib on human fertility. Based on the animal studies, impact on 
fertility associated with the use of rucaparib cannot be ruled out (see section 5.3). Moreover, according 
to its mechanism of action, rucaparib may impact human fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rubraca has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Caution when driving or using 
machines is advised for patients who report fatigue, nausea, or dizziness during treatment with 
Rubraca (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The overall safety profile of rucaparib is based on data from 1 594 patients in clinical trials in ovarian 
cancer treated with rucaparib monotherapy. Patients were exposed to rucaparib for a median of 
7.4 months. 
Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 20% of patients receiving rucaparib were nausea, fatigue/asthenia, 
vomiting, anaemia, abdominal pain, dysgeusia, ALT elevations, AST elevations, decreased appetite, 
diarrhoea, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The majority of adverse reactions were mild to 
moderate (Grade 1 or 2). 
The ≥ Grade 3 adverse reactions occurring in > 5% of patients were anaemia (25%), ALT elevations 
(10%), neutropenia (10%), fatigue/asthenia (9%), and thrombocytopenia (7%). The only serious 
adverse reaction occurring in > 2% of patients was anaemia (5%). 
Adverse reactions that most commonly led to dose reduction or interruption were anaemia (23%), 
fatigue/asthenia (15%), nausea (14%), thrombocytopenia (14%), neutropenia (10%) and AST/ALT 
elevations (10%). Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 15% of patients; 
with the most frequently reported being thrombocytopenia, nausea, anaemia, and fatigue/asthenia. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reaction frequency is listed by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) at the preferred term 
level. Frequencies of occurrence of adverse reactions are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common 
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare 
(< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Haematological toxicity 
Haematological adverse reactions of all CTCAE Grades of anaemia, thrombocytopenia and 
neutropenia were reported in 46%, 26% and 21% of patients, respectively. Anaemia and 
thrombocytopenia led to discontinuation in 2% and 1% of patients, respectively. Adverse reactions 
CTCAE Grade 3 or higher occurred in 25% (anaemia), 10% (neutropenia) and 7% (thrombocytopenia) 
of patients. The time of onset for adverse reactions of myelosuppression Grade 3 or higher was 
generally later in treatment (after 2 or more months). For risk mitigation and management, see section 
4.4. 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute myeloid leukaemia 
MDS/AML are serious adverse reactions that occur uncommonly (0.5%) in patients on treatment and 
during the 28 day safety follow up, and commonly (1.1%) for all patients including during the long 
term safety follow up (rate is calculated based on overall safety population of 3 025 patients exposed 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
to at least one dose of oral rucaparib in all clinical studies). In the placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, 
ARIEL3 and ATHENA-MONO, the incidence of MDS/AML during therapy in patients who received 
rucaparib was 1.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Although no cases were reported during therapy in 
patients who received placebo, six cases have been reported in placebo-treated patients during the long 
term safety follow up. All patients had potential contributing factors for the development of 
MDS/AML; in all cases, patients had received previous platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens 
and/or other DNA damaging agents. For risk mitigation and management, see section 4.4. 
Gastrointestinal toxicities 
Vomiting and nausea were reported in 37% and 68% of patients, respectively, and were generally low 
grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to 2). Abdominal pain (combined terms abdominal pain, abdominal pain 
lower, abdominal pain upper) was reported in 39% of rucaparib treated patients, but was also very 
common (34%) in placebo patients, most likely associated with underlying disease. For risk mitigation 
and management, see section 4.4. 
Photosensitivity 
Photosensitivity was reported in 10% of patients as low grade skin reactions (CTCAE Grade 1 or 2), 
and by 0.2% of patients as ≥ CTCAE Grade 3 reaction. For risk mitigation and management, see 
section 4.4. 
Increases in serum aminotransferases (AST/ALT) 
Events related to increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
were observed in 39% (all grades) and 10% (≥ CTCAE Grade 3) of patients. These events occurred 
within the first few weeks of treatment with rucaparib, were reversible, and were rarely associated 
with increases in bilirubin. Increased ALT was observed in 37% (all grades) and 10% (≥ CTCAE 
Grade 3) of patients; increased AST in 33% (all grades) and 3% (≥ CTCAE Grade 3) of patients and 
increased ALT and AST in 31% (all grades) and 3% (≥ CTCAE Grade 3) of patients. No events met 
Hy’s Law criteria for drug-induced liver injury. AST/ALT elevations may need to be managed with 
treatment interruption and/or dose reduction as described in Table 2 (see section 4.2). Most patients 
could continue rucaparib with or without treatment modification without recurrence of Grade ≥ 3 LFT 
abnormalities. 
Elevations in serum creatinine 
Increases in serum creatinine, predominantly mild to moderate (CTCAE Grade 1 or 2), were observed 
in 17% of patients within the first few weeks of treatment with rucaparib; 0.6% of patients reported a 
CTCAE Grade 3 reaction. Elevations in creatinine with rucaparib treatment may be due to inhibition 
of the renal transporters MATE1 and MATE2-K (see section 4.5). These increases in serum creatinine 
were clinically asymptomatic. 
Elderly 
In patients ≥ 75 years old, frequencies of some adverse reactions increased: increased blood creatinine 
(33%), dizziness (19%), pruritus (16%), and memory impairment (4%) were higher than in patients 
< 75 years old (16%, 14%, 11% and 1%, respectively). 
Patients with Renal Impairment 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr of 30-59 mL/min), frequencies of some adverse 
reactions of Grade 3 or above severity increased: anaemia (34%), neutropenia (13%), 
thrombocytopenia (12%), fatigue/asthenia (12%) and combined AST/ALT increased (12%) were 
higher than in patients with normal renal function (CLcr > 90 mL/min) (23%, 8%, 5%, 7% and 7%, 
respectively). 
Paediatric population 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of rucaparib in paediatric patients. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no specific treatment in the event of Rubraca overdose, and symptoms of overdose are not 
established. In the event of suspected overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures 
and should treat symptomatically.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XK03 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics effects 
Rucaparib is an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, including PARP-1, 
PARP-2, and PARP-3, which play a role in DNA repair. In vitro studies have shown that rucaparib-
induced cytotoxicity involves inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and the trapping of PARP-DNA 
complexes resulting in increased DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell death. 
Rucaparib has been shown to have in vitro and in vivo anti-tumour activity in BRCA mutant cell lines 
through a mechanism known as synthetic lethality, whereby the loss of two DNA repair pathways is 
required for cell death. Increased rucaparib-induced cytotoxicity and anti-tumour activity was 
observed in tumour cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair genes. Rucaparib 
has been shown to decrease tumour growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer with or 
without deficiencies in BRCA. 
Clinical efficacy 
First-Line maintenance treatment of advanced ovarian cancer 
The efficacy of rucaparib was evaluated in ATHENA, a Phase 3, double-blind, multicentre trial in 
which 538 patients with advanced ovarian (EOC), fallopian tube (FTC), or primary peritoneal cancer 
(PPC) who were in response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and surgery were enrolled. 
Response was defined as no evidence of disease progression radiologically or through rising CA-125 
(per Gynecological Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) guidelines) at any time during first-line treatment; and 
either no evidence of measurable disease by RECIST v1.1, if complete resection after surgery, or a 
response (complete or partial) if measurable disease was present after surgery and prior to 
chemotherapy, or a GCIG CA-125 response if non-measurable disease was present in the same 
situation.  
All patients had received between 4 to 8 cycles of platinum-doublet treatment (including ≥ 4 cycles of 
platinum/taxane combination). Bevacizumab treatment was allowed during first-line chemotherapy, 
but not during the maintenance rucaparib treatment. All patients were randomised within 8 weeks of 
the first day of the last cycle of chemotherapy. 
Patients were randomised (4:1) to receive rucaparib tablets 600 mg orally twice daily (n=427) or 
placebo (n=111). Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or for up 
to 2 years. Randomisation was stratified by disease status post-chemotherapy (residual disease vs. no 
residual disease), timing of surgery (primary surgery vs. interval debulking), and biomarker status. 
Biomarker status was determined using the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) test where 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
biomarker-positive was a tumour with HRD defined by the presence of a deleterious tumour BRCA 
(tBRCA) mutation or tBCRA wild type (tBRCAwt) / high genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOHhigh), 
and biomarker-negative was a tumour without HRD, defined by tBRCAwt / low genomic LOH 
(LOHlow). 
The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (invPFS) evaluated 
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), version 1.1. Key Secondary 
efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) according to 
RECIST version 1.1. invPFS, OS and ORR testing were performed hierarchically: first in the HRD 
Group, then in the ITT population. Time from randomisation to second progression or death (PFS2), 
was an additional outcome measure. 
The median age of patients treated with rucaparib was 61 years (range: 30 to 83) and 62 years (range: 
31 to 80) among patients on placebo. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status was 0 in 69% of patients receiving rucaparib and 68% of patients receiving placebo. Of the 
538 patients randomised to rucaparib or placebo, 75% had FIGO Stage III disease and 25% had Stage 
IV disease, and 16% were in complete response to their most recent platinum-based regimen. Of the 
538 patients randomised to rucaparib or placebo 78% had EOC, 13% had FTC and 9% had PPC, most 
patients (> 90%) had tumours with serous histology. In the ITT population, patients received a median 
of 6 cycles of platinum doublet chemotherapy and 17.8% of patients had received bevacizumab during 
first-line chemotherapy. Primary debulking surgery had been performed in 48.1% of patients, and 
51.9% of patients had undergone neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery. 
Overall, 43% had HRD (21% had a deleterious tBRCA mutation and 22% had tBRCAwt / LOHhigh), 
44% were HRD negative (tBRCAwt / LOHlow), and 12% had an unknown HRD status. 
ATHENA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in invPFS for patients randomised to 
rucaparib as compared with placebo in the HRD Group and the ITT Population. Results for invPFS 
with and without censoring for new anti-cancer treatment and missed visits were consistent. Efficacy 
results are presented in Table 4 and Figures 1 and Figure 2.

Maintenance treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer 
The efficacy of rucaparib was investigated in ARIEL3, a double-blind, multicentre clinical trial in 
which 564 patients with recurrent EOC, FTC or PPC who were in response to platinum-based 
chemotherapy were randomised (2:1) to receive Rubraca tablets 600 mg orally twice daily (n=375) or 
placebo (n=189). Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All 
patients had achieved a response (complete or partial) to their most recent platinum-based 
chemotherapy and their cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) was below the upper limit of normal (ULN). 
Patients were randomised within 8 weeks of completion of platinum chemotherapy and no intervening 
maintenance treatment was permitted. Patients could not have received prior rucaparib or other PARP 
inhibitor therapy. Randomisation was stratified by best response to last platinum therapy (complete or 
partial), time to progression following the penultimate platinum therapy (6 to ≤ 12 months and 
> 12 months), and tumour biomarker status (tBRCA, non-BRCA homologous recombination 
deficiency [nbHRD] and biomarker negative). 
The primary efficacy outcome was invPFS evaluated according to RECIST, version 1.1 (v1.1). PFS 
assessed by blinded independent radiology review (IRR) was a key secondary efficacy outcome. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS).  
The mean age was 61 years (range: 36 to 85 years); most of the patients were White (80%); and all 
had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The primary tumour in most patients was ovarian (84%); 
most patients (95%) had serous histology and 4% of patients reported endometrioid histology. All 
patients had received at least two prior platinum-based chemotherapies (range: 2 to 6) and 28% of 
patients had received at least three prior platinum-based chemotherapies. A total of 32% of patients 
were in complete response (CR) to their most recent therapy. The progression-free interval to 
penultimate platinum therapy was 6-12 months in 39% of patients and > 12 months in 61%. Prior 
bevacizumab therapy was reported for 22% of patients who received rucaparib and 23% of patients 
who received placebo. Demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and prior treatment history 
were generally well balanced between the rucaparib and placebo arms. 
None of the patients had received prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor. As such, efficacy of Rubraca 
in patients who have received prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor in the maintenance setting, has 
not been investigated and cannot be extrapolated from the available data. 
Tumour tissue samples for all of the patients (N=564) were tested centrally to determine HRD positive 
status (as defined by the presence of a deleterious tumour BRCA [tBRCA] mutation or high genomic 
loss of heterozygosity). Blood samples for 94% (186/196) of the tBRCA patients were evaluated using 
a central blood germline BRCA (gBRCA) test. Based on these results, 70% (130/186) of the tBRCA 
patients had a gBRCA mutation and 30% (56/186) had a somatic BRCA mutation. 
The ARIEL3 study met its primary endpoint and demonstrated a statistically significant improvement 
in invPFS for patients randomised to rucaparib as compared with placebo in the ITT population and in 
the HRD and tBRCA groups. IRR- assessment for the ITT population supported the primary endpoint. 
PFS results are summarised in Table 5 and Figure 3.

Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier Curves of Progression-Free Survival in ARIEL3 as Assessed by 
Investigator: ITT population  
At the final OS analysis (70% maturity) the Hazard Ratio (HR) was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.22; median 
36 months for rucaparib vs 43.2 months for placebo) for the ITT population. For the HRD and tBRCA 
subgroups the reported HRs were 1.01 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.32; median 40.5 months for rucaparib vs 47.8 
months for placebo) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.19; median 45.9 months for rucaparib vs 47.8 months 
for placebo), respectively. In an exploratory subgroup analyses of patients without a tBRCA mutation 
(non-nested, non-tBRCA subpopulations [LOH+, LOH-, LOH unknown]), the HR for OS was 1.084 
(95% CI: 0.841, 1.396; median 32.2 months for rucaparib vs 38.3 months for placebo). The median 
survival follow-up for all patients was 77 months (6.4 years) with a range of 2 days to 93 months (7.6 
years). 
At the time of the final analysis, 89% of patients in the placebo arm had received at least one 
subsequent treatment, of whom 46% received a PARP inhibitor. In the rucaparib arm, 78% of patients 
had received at least one subsequent treatment.  
Cardiac electrophysiology 
Concentration-QTcF prolongation analysis was conducted using data from 54 patients with a solid 
tumour administered continuous rucaparib at doses ranging from 40 mg once daily to 840 mg twice 
daily (1.4 times the approved recommended dose). At the predicted median steady-state Cmax 
following 600 mg rucaparib twice daily, the projected QTcF increase from baseline was 11.5 msec 
(90% CI: 8.77 to 14.2 msec). Thus, the risk for clinically significant QTcF increase from baseline (i.e. 
> 20 msec) is low. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Rubraca in all subsets of the paediatric population in ovarian cancer (see section 4.2 for information 
on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Plasma exposures of rucaparib, as measured by Cmax and AUC, were approximately dose proportional 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at evaluated doses (40 to 500 mg daily, 240 to 840 mg twice a day). Steady state was achieved after 
1 week of dosing. Following repeated twice daily dosing, the accumulation based on AUC ranged 
from 3.5 to 6.2 fold. 
Absorption 
In patients with cancer following rucaparib 600 mg taken twice daily, the mean steady-state Cmax was 
1940 ng/mL and AUC0-12h was 16900 h⋅ng/mL with Tmax of 1.9 hours. The mean absolute oral 
bioavailability following a single oral dose of 12 to 120 mg rucaparib was 36%. The absolute oral 
bioavailability at 600 mg has not been determined. In patients with cancer following a high-fat meal, 
the Cmax increased by 20%, the AUC0-24h increased by 38%, and the Tmax was delayed by 2.5 hours, as 
compared with dosing under fasted conditions. The food effect on PK was not considered clinically 
significant. Rubraca can be administered with or without food. 
Distribution 
The in vitro protein binding of rucaparib is 70.2% in human plasma at therapeutic concentration 
levels. Rucaparib preferentially distributed to red blood cells with a blood-to-plasma concentration 
ratio of 1.83. In patients with cancer, rucaparib had a steady-state volume of distribution of 113 L to 
262 L following a single intravenous dose of 12 mg to 40 mg rucaparib. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro, rucaparib is metabolised primarily by CYP2D6, and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2, and 
CYP3A4. In a population PK analysis, no clinically relevant PK differences were observed among 
patients with different CYP2D6 phenotypes (including poor metabolizers, n=9; intermediate 
metabolizers, n=71; normal metabolizers, n=76; and ultra-rapid metabolizers, n=4) or patients with 
different CYP1A2 phenotypes (including normal metabolizers, n=28; hyperinducers, n=136). The 
results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited representation of some subgroup 
phenotypes. 
Following administration of a single oral dose of [14C]-rucaparib to patients with solid tumours, 
unchanged rucaparib accounted for 64.0% of the radioactivity in plasma. Oxidation, N-demethylation, 
N-methylation, glucuronidation, and N-formylation were the major metabolic pathways for rucaparib. 
The most abundant metabolite was M324, an oxidative deamination product of rucaparib, accounting 
for 18.6% of the radioactivity in plasma. In vitro, M324 was at least 30 fold less potent than rucaparib 
against PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3. Other minor metabolites accounted for 13.8% of the 
radioactivity in plasma. Rucaparib accounted for 44.9% and 94.9% of radioactivity in urine and 
faeces, respectively; while M324 accounted for 50.0% and 5.1% of radioactivity in urine and faeces, 
respectively. 
Elimination 
The clearance ranged from 13.9 to 18.4 L/hour, following a single intravenous dose of rucaparib 
12 mg to 40 mg. Following administration of a single oral dose of [14C]-rucaparib 600 mg to patients, 
the overall mean recovery of radioactivity was 89.3%, with a mean recovery of 71.9% in faeces and 
17.4% in urine by 288 hours post dose. Ninety percent of the observed faecal recovery was achieved 
within 168 hours postdose. The mean half-life (t1/2) of rucaparib was 25.9 hours. 
Medicinal product interactions 
In vitro, rucaparib was shown to be a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but not a substrate of renal uptake 
transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2, or hepatic transporters OAPT1B1 and OATP1B3. Effect of P-
gp and BCRP inhibitors on rucaparib PK cannot be ruled out. 
In vitro, rucaparib reversibly inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A, and to a lesser 
extent CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and UGT1A1. Rucaparib induced CYP1A2, and down regulated CYP2B6 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. 
In vitro, rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2-K, a moderate inhibitor of OCT1, and 
a weak inhibitor of OCT2. At clinical exposures, rucaparib did not inhibit bile salt export pump 
(BSEP), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3. Inhibition of MRP4 by rucaparib cannot be fully 
ruled out at clinical exposures. No interaction with MRP2 or MRP3 was observed in vitro at the 
clinical exposure of rucaparib, however, mild bi-phasic activation and inhibition of MRP2 and 
concentration dependent inhibition of MRP3 were observed at concentrations higher than the observed 
plasma Cmax of rucaparib. The clinical relevance of MRP2 and MRP3 interaction in the gut is not 
known. In vitro, rucaparib is an inhibitor of the BCRP and P-gp efflux transporters. No significant P-
gp inhibition was observed in vivo (section 4.5). 
Population PK analysis suggested that concomitant use of PPIs is unlikely to have clinically 
meaningful impact on rucaparib PK. A firm conclusion cannot be made regarding the effect of 
co-administration of rucaparib and PPIs because dose level and time of administration have not been 
documented in detail for the PPIs. 
Pharmacokinetics in specific populations 
Age, race, and body weight 
Based on population PK analysis, no clinically significant relationships were identified between 
predicted steady-state exposure and patient’s age, race, and body weight. Patients included in the 
population PK study were aged 21 to 86 years (58% < 65 years, 31% 65-74 years, and 11% 
> 75 years), 82% were Caucasian, and had body weights between 41 and 171 kg (73% had body 
weight > 60 kg). 
Hepatic impairment 
A population PK analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance 
of rucaparib in patients receiving rucaparib 600 mg twice daily. No clinically important differences 
were observed between 34 patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST 
> ULN or total bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) and 337 patients with normal hepatic 
function. In a study evaluating the pharmacokinetics of rucaparib in patients with hepatic impairment, 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment (N=8, National Cancer Institute - Organ Dysfunction 
Working Group criteria; total bilirubin > 1.5 - ≤ 3 times ULN) had a 45% higher AUC of rucaparib 
following a single dose of 600 mg compared to patients with normal hepatic function (N=8). Cmax or 
Tmax were similar between the groups. No data are available for patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
No formal studies of rucaparib in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. A population 
PK analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the clearance of rucaparib in 
patients receiving rucaparib 600 mg twice daily. Patients with mild renal impairment (N=149; CLcr 
between 60 and 89 mL/min, as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault method) and those with moderate 
renal impairment (N=76; CLcr between 30 and 59 mL/min) showed approximately 15% and 33% 
higher steady-state AUC, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function (N=147; CLcr 
greater than or equal to 90 mL/min). The pharmacokinetic characteristics of rucaparib in patients with 
CLcr less than 30 mL/min or patients on dialysis are unknown (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
General toxicology 
The findings in non-clinical toxicology studies performed with oral rucaparib were generally 
consistent with the adverse events observed in clinical studies. In repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 
3 months duration in rats and dogs, the target organs were the gastrointestinal, haematopoietic, and 
lymphopoietic systems. These findings occurred at exposures below those observed in patients treated 
at the recommended dose, and were largely reversible within 4 weeks of cessation of dosing. In vitro, 
18 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the IC50 of rucaparib against the human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) was 22.6 µM, which is 
approximately 13-fold higher than the Cmax in patients at the recommended dose. 
Intravenous administration of rucaparib in the rat and dog induced cardiac effects at a high Cmax (5.4 to 
7.3-fold higher than patients), but not at a lower Cmax (1.3 to 3.8-fold higher than patients). No cardiac 
effects were observed with oral dosing of rucaparib in repeat-dose toxicology studies at a rucaparib 
Cmax comparable to that observed in patients. Although no cardiac effects were observed following 
oral dosing, based on the findings in the intravenous studies and safety margins, cardiac effects in 
patients cannot be excluded when rucaparib is given orally. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with rucaparib. 
Genotoxicity 
Rucaparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay. Rucaparib induced 
structural chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay. 
Reproductive toxicology 
In an embryo-foetal development study in rats, rucaparib was associated with post-implantation loss at 
exposures of approximately 0.04 times the human AUC at the recommended dose. 
Fertility studies have not been conducted with rucaparib. No effects on male and female fertility were 
observed in 3-month general toxicology studies in rats and dogs at exposures of 0.09 to 0.3 times the 
human AUC at the recommended dose. A potential risk cannot be ruled out based on the safety margin 
observed. In addition, according to its mechanism of action rucaparib may have the potential to impair 
fertility in humans.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rubraca is and what it is used for 
What Rubraca is and how it works 
Rubraca contains the active substance rucaparib. Rubraca is an anti-cancer medicine, also known as a 
‘PARP (poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase) inhibitor’. 
Patients with changes (mutations) in genes called BRCA are at risk of developing a number of types of 
cancer. Rubraca blocks an enzyme that repairs damaged DNA in the cancer cells, resulting in their 
death. 
What Rubraca is used for 
Rubraca is used to treat a type of cancer of the ovary. It is used as maintenance therapy immediately 
after a course of chemotherapy that has caused the tumour to shrink. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Rubraca 
Do not take Rubraca 
• 
if you are allergic to rucaparib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
if you are breast-feeding 
• 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rubraca. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before or during taking Rubraca. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blood tests 
Your doctor or nurse will perform blood tests to check your blood cell-counts: 
• 
• 
before treatment with Rubraca 
every month during treatment with Rubraca 
This is because Rubraca can cause low blood counts of: 
• 
• 
red blood-cells, white blood-cells, or platelets. See section 4 for more information. The signs 
and symptoms of low blood cell counts include fever, infection, bruising or bleeding. 
a low blood-cell count may be a sign of a serious bone marrow problem - such as 
‘myelodysplastic syndrome’ (MDS) or ‘acute myeloid leukaemia’ (AML). Your doctor may test 
your bone marrow to check for any problems. 
Your doctor may also do weekly tests, if you have low blood cell counts for a long time. They may 
stop treatment with Rubraca until your blood cell counts improve. 
Take care in direct sunlight 
You may get sunburn more easily during treatment with Rubraca. This means you should: 
• 
keep out of direct sunlight and not use sunbeds while you are taking Rubraca 
• 
wear clothing that covers your head, arms and legs 
• 
use a sunscreen and lip balm with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 50 or higher. 
Symptoms you should be aware of 
Talk to your doctor if you feel sick (nauseous), have been sick (vomiting) or you have had diarrhoea or 
abdominal pain. These may be signs and symptoms that Rubraca is affecting your stomach or bowels. 
Children and adolescents 
Children under 18 years of age should not be given Rubraca. This medicine has not been studied in 
this age group. 
Other medicines and Rubraca 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Rubraca can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other 
medicines can affect the way Rubraca works. 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
• 
anticoagulant medicines which helps the blood flow freely, such as warfarin 
• 
anticonvulsant medicines used to treat fits (seizures) and epilepsy - such as phenytoin 
• 
medicines to lower blood cholesterol levels- such as rosuvastatin 
• 
medicines to treat stomach problems - such as cisapride, omeprazole 
• 
medicines which suppress the immune system - such as ciclosporin, sirolimus or tacrolimus 
• 
medicines to treat migraines and headaches - such as dihydroergotamine or ergotamine 
• 
medicines to treat severe pain - such as alfentanil or fentanyl 
• 
medicines used to treat uncontrolled movement or mental disorders - such as pimozide 
• 
medicines to lower blood sugar levels and treat diabetes - such as metformin 
• 
medicines to treat irregular heartbeats - such as digoxin or quinidine 
• 
medicines to treat allergic reactions - such as astemizole or terfenadine 
•

Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
• 
• 
Rubraca is not recommended during pregnancy. This is because it may harm your unborn baby. 
For women who are able to become pregnant, a pregnancy test is recommended before starting 
treatment with Rubraca. 
Breast-feeding 
• 
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Rubraca, and for two weeks after taking the last dose. 
This is because it is not known if rucaparib passes into breast milk. 
Contraception 
•  Women who are able to become pregnant must use effective birth control (contraception): 
during treatment with Rubraca and 
for 6 months after taking the last dose of Rubraca. 
- 
- 
This is because rucaparib may affect the unborn baby. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the most effective methods of contraception. 
• 
Driving and using machines 
Rubraca may affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. Take care if you feel tired or feel 
sick (nauseous). 
Rubraca contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.

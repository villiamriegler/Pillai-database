Part VI:  Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Hizentra (Human normal immunoglobulin for 
subcutaneous use (SCIg)) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Hizentra. The RMP details 
important risks of Hizentra, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Hizentra's risks. 
Hizentra’s reference safety information (referred to as the Summary of Product 
Characteristics [SmPC] and the Patient Information Leaflet [PIL] in Europe), give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Hizentra should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Hizentra should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Hizentra's RMP. 
I.  The medicine and what it is used for 
Hizentra is authorised for replacement therapy in Primary Immunodeficiency Disease (PID) 
and symptomatic hypogammaglobulinaemia secondary to underlying disease or treatment; as 
well as an immunomodulatory therapy in chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyneuropathy (CIDP). Refer to the product’s reference safety information (the SmPC and 
PIL in Europe) for full information on indications. It contains human normal immunoglobulin 
as the active substance, and it is given by subcutaneous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Hizentra’s benefits can be found in Hizentra’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage link: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/hizentra.  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of Hizentra, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Hizentra's risks, are outlined below. 
•  Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
-  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, which 
are addressed in the reference safety information (the SmPC and PIL in Europe) for 
healthcare professionals and patients; 
- 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
-  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
-  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment, so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Hizentra are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Hizentra. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine):

Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Local reactions including UL-ISRs 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
There is significant evidence from numerous case reports of local 
reactions observed from post-marketing surveillance and clinical trials 
(frequency: very common). Additionally, evidence from the scientific 
literature supports a causal association with SCIg products. This risk is 
a known class effect of SCIg products, and is considered an adverse 
reaction occurring with high frequency in the indicated populations, 
which could have a severe impact (eg, discontinuation of treatment). 
Most patients experience mild local reactions, even on stable dosing, 
suggesting that other individual factors may be the key drivers of local 
reactions, in contrast to dosing.  
Specific risk groups or risk factors are not known, and relevant 
information from CSLB’s large outcome studies did not identify any 
clear risk groups/factors, nor any association between higher doses, 
infusion rates or volume and a higher rate of local reactions. Similarly, 
no specific risk groups or risk factors for the development of UL-ISRs 
(including infusion site necrosis) have been identified since the etiology 
for the occurrence is not clearly understood.

Important identified risk: Anaphylactic reactions 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
A limited number of anaphylactic reaction case reports have been 
observed from post-marketing surveillance, however there have been no 
cases from clinical trials (frequency: unknown). Additionally, evidence 
from the scientific literature supports a causal relationship with Ig 
products, including SCIg. This risk is a known class effect of Ig 
products, and is considered serious due to the potential life-threatening 
nature. 
General risk factors for drug allergy include age (more likely in adults), 
gender (female), genetic polymorphisms, certain viral infections, and 
previous reaction to the drug. Additionally, parenteral route and/or 
frequent/prolonged administration are considered more immunogenic.  
Specifically, Hizentra may present an increased risk of anaphylaxis in 
IgA deficient patients as it contains traces of IgA, however the role of 
IgA in anaphylactic reactions is often described as controversial. Many 
 
 
Important identified risk: Anaphylactic reactions 
patients with low IgA levels tolerate products that are not specifically 
designated as low IgA.

Important identified risk: Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
A limited number of AMS case reports have been observed from post-
marketing surveillance and clinical trials (frequency: uncommon). 
Additionally, evidence from the scientific literature supports a causal 
relationship with Ig products, predominantly IVIg. This risk is a known 
class effect of Ig products, which could have a severe impact (eg, 
medical intervention, discontinuation of treatment). 
In patients treated with IVIg, high dosages infused over short periods 
may be a risk factor, however the development of AMS is not limited to 
high dosages, and has been observed with typical replacement dosages.  
Other risk factors for AMS include: 
- 
a history of headache or migraine; however it remains 
questionable if such pre-existing disorders play a major role; 
- 
- 
- 
- 
hypertensive disease; 
dehydration; 
female patients, with an approximate 4-fold higher rate; 
children with autoimmune diseases. 
Data indicates that aseptic meningitis occurs significantly less often 
after SCIg therapy than IVIg therapy.

Important identified risk: Thromboembolic Event (TEE) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
A limited number of TEE case reports have been observed from post-
marketing surveillance, however there have been no serious, related 
cases from clinical trials (frequency: unknown). Additionally, evidence 
from the scientific literature supports a causal relationship with Ig 
products, predominantly IVIg. This risk is a known class effect of Ig 
products, and is considered serious due to the potential life-threatening 
nature of certain types of TEE.

•  Hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors 
•  Diabetes mellitus 
•  History of vascular disease or thrombotic episodes 
•  Acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders

Important potential risk: Increased or unknown risks in the home-based SC (self-) administration 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
On the basis of theoretical considerations, increased or unknown risks 
in the home-based SC (self-) administration is considered to have the 
potential for a severe impact (eg, medical intervention, discontinuation 
of treatment). A limited number of reports have been observed from 
post-marketing surveillance, however there is no information from 
clinical trials (frequency: unknown).

Important potential risk: Exacerbation of existing hyperprolinaemia 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
On the basis of theoretical considerations, exacerbation of existing 
hyperprolinaemia is considered to have the potential for a severe impact 
(eg, medical intervention, discontinuation of treatment). There is no 
information from post-marketing surveillance or clinical trials 
(frequency: unknown).

Important potential risk: Haemolysis 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
A limited number of haemolysis case reports have been observed from 
post-marketing surveillance, however there have been no related cases 
from clinical trials (frequency: unknown). Additionally, evidence from 
the scientific literature supports a causal relationship with Ig products, 
predominantly IVIg. This risk is a known class effect of Ig products, 
which could have a severe impact (eg, medical intervention, 
discontinuation of treatment). 
Risk factors for hemolysis include high-dose infusions, underlying 
recipient health conditions (eg, inflammatory conditions, autoimmune, 
or immune-mediated disorders), prior episode of haemolysis, and non-O 
blood group.  
Differences in immunoglobulin products manufacturing processes 
resulting in higher titers of anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinins may also 
play a role, with 1 study showing that products with high anti-A/anti-B 
titers have elevated haemolysis reaction reporting rates, particularly 
when larger cumulative doses were administered.

Important potential risk: Transmission of infectious agents 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
There have been no confirmed cases from post-marketing surveillance 
or clinical trials, however the risk of transmission of infectious agents 
cannot be totally excluded when medicinal products prepared from 
human blood/plasma are administered. Historically, viral transmission 
cases (eg, HBV, HCV) have been reported in the scientific literature for 
other older Ig products (lyophilised preparations only), which occurred 
prior to the recognition of the importance of donor selection criteria, 
serological screening, and effective and well-validated viral removal 
and inactivation processes. This risk is considered serious due to the 
life-threatening nature and potential for death. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients administered medicinal products prepared from human 
blood/plasma.

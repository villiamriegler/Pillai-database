2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Acromegaly 
Acromegaly is a rare, serious, and debilitating condition caused by chronic hypersecretion of growth hormone 
(GH),  which,  in  over  95%  of  patients,  originates  from  a  GH-secreting  pituitary  adenoma.  In  patients  with 
acromegaly, basal GH secretion is characterized by a continuous high level with relatively blunted bursts, in 
comparison  to  the  general  population  who  usually  maintain  a  low  GH  level  during  the  day,  ranging  from 
undetectable  to  secretory  peaks  of  up  to  15  μg/L  during  sleep.  Insulin-like  growth  factor-1  (IGF-1),  which 
mediates most of the growth-promoting actions of GH, is elevated in parallel with the log of GH concentration. 
The clinical manifestations of acromegaly are due to the peripheral actions of GH and IGF-1 and local tumour 
mass effect. The chronic GH and  IGF-1 excess  leads  to  progressive somatic disfigurement due to  excessive 
skeletal growth and soft tissue enlargement. Metabolic complications include increased blood glucose levels, 
hyperinsulinaemia, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia. Local tumour effects may lead to visual field defects, and in 
case  of  large  extensive  tumours  to  hydrocephalus  or  focal  epilepsy.  Further  complications  include 
panhypopituitarism,  hypertension,  cardiac  myopathies,  colonic  polyps,  carpal  tunnel  syndrome,  goiter  and 
respiratory  complications  (e.g.  sleep  apnea,  upper  airway  obstruction).  Acromegaly  can  cause  a  variety  of 
symptoms, such as headache, excessive sweating, arthralgia, paresthesia and severe lethargy. In addition, in 
patients with adenomas which co-secrete GH and prolactin (approximately 30% of acromegaly patients), the 
prolactin excess leads to infertility and gonadal and sexual dysfunction.  
Patients with acromegaly have a shortened life expectancy, with a mortality rate that is approximately twice that 
of  the general population,  and  an  average reduction  in life expectancy of 10 years. The excess  mortality is 
primarily  a  result  of  cardiovascular  disease  and  respiratory  complications.  High  GH/IGF-1  levels,  arterial 
hypertension and cardiomyopathy confer a poorer prognosis. 
The prevalence of acromegaly is estimated to be 40 to 70 cases per million, with an annual incidence of 3 to 4 
new cases per million. Owing to its insidious onset, acromegaly is often diagnosed late (4 to more than 10 years 
after onset), at an average age of about 40 years. 
Clinical  diagnosis  is  suggested  by  the  typical  disfigurement  of  the  patient  related  to  progressive  acral 
enlargement  and  modification  of  facial  appearance.  Diagnosis  is  confirmed  biochemically  by  findings  of 
increased serum GH concentrations that are not suppressed following an oral glucose tolerance test, and by 
increased IGF-I levels. 
The  therapeutic  goals  in  acromegaly  are  to  relieve  symptoms,  to  reduce  pituitary  tumour  volume,  to  avoid 
tumour relapse, and to reduce mortality to the expected age- and sex-adjusted rates. 
Current treatment options 
Treatment modalities for acromegaly include surgery, radiotherapy and medical treatment. 
Surgery: Transphenoidal surgery is currently the most frequently recommended treatment, except for patients 
who are poor surgical candidates, have invasive tumours, or who refuse surgery. The surgical effectiveness 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 10/122 
  
  
 
varies  depending  on  expertise  in  pituitary  surgery  and  the  size  and  extension  of  the  anatomic  mass.  Early 
remission, defined by target GH levels of <2.5 μg/L, are achieved in about half of all patients. Patients who do 
not achieve normalization of GH and IGF-1 with surgery require additional treatment, usually with medication. 
On the other hand, if damage to the surrounding normal pituitary tissue occurs during surgery, the patient may 
require lifelong pituitary hormone replacement. 
Radiotherapy: Radiation is usually reserved for patients who have tumour remaining after surgery, for patients 
who  are  poor  candidates  for  surgery,  and  for  patients  who  do  not  respond  adequately  to  surgery  and/or 
medication. The main disadvantages of radiotherapy are that normalization of GH secretion may take more than 
10 years to occur, and that most patients eventually develop anterior pituitary insufficiency. Complications are 
now  very  rare,  but  concerns  have  been  raised  over  an  association  of  radiotherapy  with  premature 
cerebrovascular disease. 
Medical  treatment:  Currently  the  medical  treatment  options  for  acromegaly  include  somatostatin  analogues 
(SSAs), GH antagonists, and dopamine agonists. 
SSAs are the medical treatment of choice in acromegaly. Currently two different molecular entities, octreotide 
(Sandostatin) and lanreotide (Somatuline), are available commercially. Octreotide, which has been available for 
25 years, is available as a short-acting sc formulation for twice-daily administration, and a long-acting (LAR) 
microsphere preparation administered by im injection every 4 weeks. Lanreotide is available in a microsphere 
formulation  (sustained  release  [SR])  and  a  saturated  aqueous  solution  (Autogel  [ATG]);  the  recommended 
initial injection frequency is every 2 weeks for the SR formulation and every 4 weeks for the ATG formulation. 
Current medical management of patients with acromegaly generally employs use of either octreotide LAR or 
lanreotide  ATG  (Melmed  2009).  In  prospective,  multicenter,  international,  controlled,  large  clinical  studies 
performed with octreotide in patients naive to previous SSA treatment the rate of biochemical control (i.e. GH ≤  
2.5 μg/L and normal IGF- 1) in the ITT populations were between 18 and 27% (Mercado et al 2007, Colao et al 
2009). 
Both octreotide and lanreotide inhibit tumour growth; around 75% of patients experience reduction in tumour 
volume of at least 20% with octreotide LAR as first-line therapy, whereas the proportion of patients with tumour 
shrinkage appears to be lower with lanreotide. The administration of SSAs prior to transphenoidal surgery also 
improves  the  outcome  of  surgery  and  acromegaly-associated  morbidity.  Known  side  effects  include 
asymptomatic gallstones and transient gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain) 
in approximately 30% of patients, and injection site pain and bradycardia have also been reported. 
Pegvisomant (Somavert), a pegylated recombinant GH analogue is currently the only commercially available GH 
antagonist. It is indicated for patients who have had an inadequate response to surgery and/or radiation therapy 
and/or other medical therapies, or for whom these therapies are not appropriate. The efficacy of pegvisomant in 
reducing circulating IGF-1 levels is relatively high (around 75% of patients achieved normal IGF-1 levels after 2 
years), and is additive with that of SSAs. While pegvisomant antagonizes peripheral action of GH and blocks 
IGF-1  generation,  it  does  not  reduce  circulating  GH  levels  and  does  not  impede  tumour  growth.  Transient 
increases  in  hepatic  transaminase  levels  are  observed  in  ~5%  of  patients.  Other  side  effects  include 
injection-site reactions and lipohypertrophy, likely reflecting local adipocyte GH insensitivity. 
Dopamine  agonists  (e.g.  bromocriptine,  quinagolide,  cabergoline)  bind  to  D2  dopamine  receptors  in  the 
pituitary  gland  and  suppress  secretion  of  prolactin  and  GH.  They  have  been  used  in  acromegaly  both  as 
monotherapy and in combination with an SSA. Their advantage is that they can be administered orally and are 
of relatively low cost. The efficacy of bromocriptine is low, with about 10% of patients normalizing IGF-1. The 
second-generation cabergoline is more effective, about half of patients achieving GH levels <2.5 μg/L, a third 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 11/122 
  
  
normalizing  IGF-1,  and  tumour  shrinkage  observed  in  a  third  of  patients.  Cabergoline  appears  to  be  more 
effective  in  patients  with  tumours  co-secreting  prolactin  and  GH,  and  in  patients  with  lower  baseline  IGF-1 
levels, however the data reported in individual studies is highly variable. Less data is available for quinagolide, 
with response rates between 17% and 43% reported for normalization of IGF-1. Dopamine agonists are not 
widely used, as they are  associated with an increased risk of cardiac valvular dysfunction, which may be of 
particular concern in a patient population with cardiac co-morbidities including left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Unmet medical need 
A significant proportion of patients with acromegaly do not achieve biochemical control with currently available 
treatment options (surgery, currently available medical treatment options, or radiotherapy). There is, therefore, 
a  significant  unmet  need  for  additional,  more  effective  medical  treatment  options  both  in  newly  diagnosed 
patients  with  acromegaly  for  whom  surgery  is  not  an  option,  and  in  those  patients  who  do  not  achieve 
biochemical control post surgery or with currently available therapies. 
About the product 
Signifor contains pasireotide and is a somatostatin analogue (SSA) exerting its pharmacological activity through 
binding to somatostatin receptors. Pasireotide is a cyclic hexapeptide (pasireotide  embonate; also known as 
pasireotide pamoate). The pasireotide subcutaneous (sc) formulation (pasireotide diaspartate) was approved in 
the EU on 24-Apr-2012 for the treatment of Cushing’s disease. 
The  purpose  of  this  application  is  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  for  pasireotide  powder  and  solvent  for 
suspension for intramuscular (im) injection (also referred to as pasireotide long-acting release (LAR)) 20 mg, 40 
mg and 60 mg. 
The following revised indication was proposed by the time of conclusion of the procedure: 
Signifor is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with acromegaly for whom surgery is not an option or has 
not been curative and who are inadequately controlled on treatment with another somatostatin analogue. 
Pasireotide LAR is provided as pasireotide embonate in vials containing 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg.  
Pasireotide LAR is intended for deep intramuscular injections every 4 weeks. The recommended initial dose is 40 
mg every 4 weeks with a maximum dose of 60 mg every 4 weeks. There are no dose adjustments recommended 
in the elderly or in renal impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment an initial dose of 20 mg and 
a maximum dose of 40 mg are recommended. Pasireotide LAR should not be used in patients with in severe 
hepatic impairment. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  powder  and  solvent  for  suspension  for  injection  (i.m.)  containing 
pasireotide embonate as active substance corresponding to 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg of pasireotide. It is a 
long-acting release (LAR) formulation intended to be administered once a month containing microparticles of 
pasireotide embonate.  The active substance  in this LAR formulation  is a different salt (embonate instead of 
diaspartate) to the currently authorised Signifor solution for injection.

poloxamer 188 and water for injections in the solvent, as described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The product is available in vials containing the powder and pre-filled syringe containing the solvent, packaged in 
a blister together with a vial adapter and a safety injection needle as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
is 
The  active  substance  pasireotide  embonate 
(2R,5S,8S,11S,14R,17S,19aS)-11-(4-aminobutyl)-5-benzyl- 
(2-Aminoethyl)carbamic 
8-(4-benzyloxybenzyl)-14-(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaoxo-17-phenyloctadecahydro-3a,6,9,1
2,15,18 hexaazacyclopenta cyclooctadecen-2-yl ester pamoic acid salt, corresponding to the chemical structure 
below.  Its molecular formula is C58H66N10O9 • C23H16O6 and has a relative molecular mass 1047.21 (base), or 
1435.58 (embonate salt). 
is  a  cyclic  hexapeptide. 
Its  chemical  name 
acid 
It appears as a white to yellowish, hygroscopic, amorphous powder, practically insoluble in water and in buffers 
above pH 4 but slightly soluble in 0.1 N HCl. The pKa values for pasireotide base are pKa1 = 10.2, pKa2 = 9.1. 
However, it has not been possible to evaluate either the pKa nor the Log P and Log D for the embonate salt due 
to its low solubility in water and n-octanol respectively.  
The structure of the active substance is supported has been confirmed by elemental analysis, UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 
13C-NMR and MS. 
Pasireotide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence seven stereocentres. Nevertheless each amino acid 
used in the solid phase peptide synthesis is a pure stereoisomer of known absolute configuration. Due to the 
chosen  synthetic  conditions  no  changes  occur  to  the  amino  acids’  stereochemistry,  which  is  controlled  by 
appropriate specification, during the peptide chain synthesis and this was demonstrated by analysing sufficient 
number of batches of active substance. There is also no influence on the established stereochemistry during the 
formation of the cyclopeptide either, which was demonstrated by analysis results of sufficient number of batches 
of pasireotide embonate. 
No crystalline form was identified  and  pasireotide embonate  is consistently  manufactured  as  an amorphous 
powder only. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Pasireotide embonate is produced by solid phase peptide synthesis in nine steps. The starting and raw materials 
used in the synthesis are commercially available or prepared from commercially available materials and are 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 13/122 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
controlled by suitable specifications. Apart from  the first three  batches all  other  subsequent batches during 
development were manufactured with the commercial process. The critical steps in the synthesis have been 
identified and reported and controlled by appropriate in-process controls. 
The manufacturing process of pasireotide embonate is similar up to salt formation to the currently approved 
pasireotide diaspartate. Both drug substances share the same bond forming steps, chromatographic purification 
and only differ in the salt forming agent (embonate instead of diaspartate). 
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  and  degradation  products  have  been 
characterised and toxicologically qualified as appropriate.  
As the manufacturing process is fully synthetic and there are no aseptic or sterilisation processes, validation 
results  were  not  presented.  However,  validation  on  three  consecutive  commercial-scale  batches  will  be 
performed in accordance with an agreed protocol to confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests    and  limits  for:  appearance  (visual),  particle  size  (laser 
diffraction), specific surface area (nitrogen adsorption), identity (IR, HPLC), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), water 
content (KF), heavy metals (ICP-OES), assay (HPLC), assay of salt forming agent (ion chromatography), amino 
acid analysis (hydrolysis-separation-derivatisation-photometric detection), related substances (HPLC), residual 
solvents (GC), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), clarity and colour of the solution (Ph. Eur.), microbiological 
quality (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data from four representative development batches manufactured in the production equipment 
and used in nonclinical, clinical, technical and stability studies have been provided.  
Moreover seven production scale batches of pasireotide embonate, manufactured at the proposed commercial 
production site, have additionally been tested  by  gas chromatography  with flame ionisation detection (FID) 
method for the absence of residual solvents used in earlier synthetic steps of manufacturing process  of  the 
active  substance.  All  the  provided  results  were  within  the  proposed  specification  for  the  active  substance 
confirming the consistency of the process. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions at -20 ºC / ambient RH and 
for up to 12 months under accelerated conditions at 5°C ± 3°C / ambient RH and 25 ºC / 60% RH according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Two further batches were placed on  stability  under  the  same  range of conditions to evaluate the impact of 
elevated heavy metal content and of an alternative packaging type on the active substance stability. Results 
available up to 60 months in long term have been presented for an alternative type of packaging. 
Tests parameters monitored during the stability studies were appearance, identity, related substances, water 
content,  specific  optical  rotation,  clarity  of  the  solution,  colour  of  the  solution  and  assay.  Particle  size 
distribution, specific surface area, microbial enumeration test and bacterial endotoxins test were also tested at 
certain  time  points,  conditions  and/or  packaging  as  per  the  stability  protocol.  The  acceptance  criteria  and 
methods were the same as those for release. The analytical methods were shown to be stability indicating. 
No significant changes were observed in any physical, chemical and microbiological parameters tested. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on  one batch. The results indicate the 
active substance should be protected from light. 
Results on stress conditions (strong acidic, strong alkalic, oxidative, heat, open dish) were also provided on one 
batch.

Based on presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions for pasireotide embonate 
are acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The  objective  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  develop  a  powder  and  solvent  for  suspension  for 
intramuscular  (im)  injection  for  long-acting  release  (LAR)  of  20  mg,  40  mg  or  60  mg  of  pasireotide.  By 
controlling the release rate, the LAR formulation is expected to produce less peak-to-trough fluctuation than an 
immediate release subcutaneous formulation thereby potentially minimising adverse events. 
Signifor powder and solvent for suspension for injection finished product consists of: 
•  powder (i.e. microparticles) containing the active substance filled in vials, and a 
•  solvent (solution composed of commonly used excipients and water for injections) filled in prefilled syringes 
in which the microparticles are suspended prior to injection. 
The embonate salt has been selected for the long acting release formulation based on its low solubility in water 
as well as superior stability in the selected controlled release polymer system.  The active substance is uniformly 
distributed  within  the  microparticles,  which  consist  of  a  mixture  of  two  poly  (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) 
copolymers (PLGA), and from which the active substance is continuously released primarily by diffusion and 
hydrolysis/erosion. All dosage strengths (20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg) are derived from the same microparticles, 
and differ only in the amount of powder filled in the vials. Different variants differing in copolymer composition, 
ratio and manufacturing process have been developed and tested in Phase I studies. The proposed formulation 
was selected because of the most favourable PK profile. 
The two copolymers, belong to a well-known family of biocompatible poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) copolymers, 
which  have  been  used  for  many  years  in  similar  commercial  products.  They  are  composed  of  lactide  and 
glycolide building blocks and degrade into lactic and glycolic acid, both of which occur physiologically in the body 
and are metabolised by normal physiological pathways and are suitable for use in human by the intended route 
of  administration.  Both  copolymers  are  controlled  prior  to  their  use  in  the  manufacture  of  microparticles 
according to in-house appropriate testing monographs. 
Drug burst, which determines the release within the first 24 hours, and drug release, which characterises the 
long term release, are critical quality attributes for the finished product performance. Besides solubility, the 
active substance particle size distribution (PSD) and specific surface area (SSA) are potential critical physical 
properties for the product performance and they are therefore routinely controlled.  Further experiments on the 
influence of active substance SSA on the finished product critical quality attributes (e.g. finished product particle 
size distribution, drug burst, drug release) revealed a relationship between SSA and product PSD and support 
the  proposed  specification  for  these  parameters.  The  influence  of  particle  size  on  drug  burst  has  been  also 
demonstrated and suitable limits have been established based on batches from clinical trials. 
Finally the drug release test is performed at accelerated conditions to obtain complete release within six days 
qualifying  it  as  a  routine  quality  control  test.  This  accelerated  test  method  has  been  shown  to  discriminate 
batches with different polymeric ratios and molecular masses, and different process parameters. However since 
the  reproducibility  of  manufacturing  process  regarding  in  vivo  performance  in  other  sites  (used  during 
development) has not been demonstrated, any changes in the manufacturing process as well as any future new 
manufacturing site have to be verified by bioequivalence studies. 
The solvent is a 2 ml clear, colourless to slightly yellow or slightly brown solution, filled in prefilled syringes with 
rubber stoppers, finger grip, hub and cap. It is used to suspend powder to prepare the suspension for injection 
prior to administration. The solvent development (choice of excipients, selection of manufacturing process, and 
choice  of  container  closure  system)  was  based  on  previous  experience  from  other  authorised  microparticle 
medicinal products. The solvent was further modified to meet the product specific requirements to provide an 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014

isotonic  aqueous  solution  of  physiological  pH,  and  to  suspend  the  dry  microparticle  powder  within  short 
timeframe leading to a homogeneous suspension for parenteral administration. The excipients employed are 
standard pharmacopoeial excipients commonly used in parenteral formulations. A vial adapter was additionally 
introduced to allow easy transfer of the solvent into the vial and the transfer of the suspension into the syringe 
by the user. 
All  dosage  strengths  of  microparticles  must  be  suspended  in  the  2  ml  solvent  and  the  resulting  suspension 
should be readily injected. This was demonstrated during development and is ensured by a suspendability test 
being performed as part of the specification. The leachable study results demonstrated that leachable compound 
levels are below the safety concern threshold (SCT) for any individual compound.  
As  the  drug  product  is  to  be  used  together  with  the  solvent,  without  any  dilution  with  other  products,  no 
compatibility data with other products are required.  Satisfactory in-use compatibility data have been presented 
with the proposed vial adapter. 
The  sterilisation  method  was  selected  taking  into  account  the  physicochemical  properties  of  the  active 
substance.The efficiency of the selected sterilisation method has been adequately demonstrated. Also during 
development  the  manufacturing  process  has  been  successfully  scaled-up  to  the  commercial  facilities.  There 
were no changes of any critical process parameters observed during up-scaling. 
The finished product, primary packed in injection vials, is co-packaged in a protective blister containing the 
pre-filled  syringe  of  the  solvent,  vial  adapter  and  safety  injection  needle.  Both  the  vial  adapter  and  safety 
injection needle are CE marked. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for the powder consists of preparation of organic and aqueous phases, preparation 
of  microparticles,  washing;  drying  and  sieving  of  microparticles,  filling  and  stoppering  of  the  vials  and 
terminalsterilisation.  The  critical  process  steps  and  intermediates  have  been  identified  and  the  proposed 
in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Process  validation  for  this  non-standard  process  was  performed  using  full-scale  production  batches  of  bulk 
powder for suspension for injection (microparticles). Each bulk batch has been filled in one vial batch of each 
strength  resulting  in  overall  nine  vial  batches,  three  per  strength,  and  terminally  sterilized  by  gamma 
irradiation. The validation batches have been processed in the same manufacturing facilities, using the same 
process and the same equipment as for the batches intended for commercial supply. The presented validation 
data confirm that the manufacture is sufficiently robust to produces product of consistent quality complying with 
the designated specification. 
The manufacturing process for the solvent consists of standard manufacturing processes and employing the 
dissolving of the excipients in water for injection, filtering and filling into the glass syringes followed by terminal 
sterilisation. No critical process parameters were identified because although the sterility may be regarded as 
critical, all contributing factors for achieving a sterile product are validated and well controlled and therefore 
each single step is regarded as non-critical. Furthermore the process is controlled by appropriate in-process 
control testing performed during manufacture. The  manufacturing method of  the solvent for suspension for 
injection has been validated using three full-scale production batches which have been processed in the same 
manufacturing  facilities,  using  the  same  process  and  the  same  equipment  as  for  the  batches  intended  for 
marketing. The validation results were provided and are compliant with specifications.  
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for  appearance,  (visual 
examination), suspendability (visual examination), pH of the constituted suspension (Ph. Eur.), identification 
(HPLC  and  TLC),  water  content  (KF),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  particle  size  (laser  light 
diffraction), uniformity of dosage unit (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), drug burst and drug release 
Assessment report

(Ph. Eur. –HPLC), molecular mass of the polymer (GPC), tightness of container (dye intrusion), uniformity of 
deliverable dose (HPLC) and sterility (Ph. Eur.).  
Batch analysis results  are  provided for nine validation  and  eight  clinical  batches  all of  which are  considered 
representative of commercial batches. Results  confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The specifications for the release and stability testing of the solvent include appropriate tests and limits for 
appearance of the container (visual examination), clarity and colour of the solution (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), 
viscosity (Ph. Eur.), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), subvisible particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), visible particles (Ph. 
Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and tightness of containers (visual by dye intrusion). 
Results of analysis of representative stability and production scale batches of the solvent were provided and they 
comply with the specifications. 
All  analytical  methods  used  for  both  the  powder  and  the  solvent  have  been  well  described  and  validated 
according to ICH guidelines. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for three pilot batches of 20 mg strength and three pilot batches of 80 mg strength 
stored in both inverted  and upright  position  under long term conditions  at  5°C /ambient  humidity  for up to 
36 months and under accelerated conditions at 30°C/75% RH and 25 ºC / 60% RH up to 36 months and under 
40 ºC / 75% RH and -20°C/ ambient humidity for up to six months according to the ICH guidelines. 
At start of the stability studies program the 80mg strength was considered the highest possible strength. Hence 
in  line  with  ICH  requirements  the  40mg  and  60mg  strengths  are  bracketed  by  20mg  and  80mg  strengths. 
However the 80 mg strength was not eventually applied for authorisation. For this reason, two pilot batches of 
60 mg strength, in addition, were also studied for stability  and data were presented for up to 24 months at 5°C 
/ambient humidity and at 25 ºC / 60% RH. 
The different dosage strengths differ only in filling different amounts of microparticles (powder for suspension 
for injection) into the primary packaging proposed for marketing therefore they are considered representative to 
those proposed for marketing and the matrixing approach is deemed acceptable. 
Samples were tested as per the release specification test by the same analytical methods which are considered 
stability  indicating.  All  chemical  and  physical  data  generated  over  36  months  under  the  proposed  storage 
condition, stored inverted and upright, meet the specifications. No difference was observed between inverted 
and upright storage. 
In addition, two batches (one 20 mg and one 80 mg strength) were exposed to light as defined in the ICH 
Guideline on Photostability. Results show that exposure to light has no effect on the product quality. 
Finally freeze and thaw cycle test showed no trends and all results comply with the specifications. 
In-use stability of the suspension 
Stability  of  the  suspended  solution  in  vials  has  also  been  investigated  and  the  data  demonstrate  that  the 
suspensions are stable at room temperature over 3 hours.  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of Signifor 20mg, 40mg and 60mg powder 
and solvent for suspension for injection.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The type of formulation drove the choice of the active substance salt and the 
controlled release formulation system. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the active substance were 
taken into account in the selection of the manufacturing process. The performance of the long acting formulation 
has been ensured by appropriate design of the pharmaceutical formulation and the processes and the applied 
control strategy. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform 
performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Several studies relevant for this application were submitted and assessed within the frame of the initial MAA for 
pasireotide (EMEA/H/C/2052). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
A number of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies were performed by the Applicant to evaluate the effects 
of pasireotide on GH and IGF-1 secretion, the two primary biochemical parameters used to evaluate efficacy of 
treatment for acromegaly. These studies were submitted and assessed within the frame of the initial MAA for 
pasireotide (EMEA/H/C/2052) and can be summarized as follows: 
Functional activity at human recombinant somatostatin receptor subtypes demonstrated pasireotide to be a full 
agonist,  with  nanomolar  or  subnanomolar  potency  at  hsst1,  hsst2,  hsst3  and  hsst5  receptor  subtypes. 
Consistent  with  its  high  in  vitro  binding  affinity  for  sst2  and  especially  sst5,  pasireotide  inhibits  the 
GHRH-induced  GH  release  from  primary  cultures  of  rat  pituitary  cells.  In  vivo  in  rats,  pasireotide  inhibited 
unstimulated GH release and caused a dose-dependent decrease in plasma IGF-1 levels following sc infusion of 
1, 10 or 50 µg/kg/h of pasireotide for 7 days. In rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys, pasireotide is also a strong 
inhibitor of GH and IGF-1. The ID50 of pasireotide for the inhibition of GH in rhesus monkey was 0.4 µg/kg sc 
and thus similar to the values obtained in rats.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 18/122 
  
  
 
For the present application, a new in vivo study concerning the effect of pasireotide LAR on hormone secretion 
in rats was submitted. Single sc injection with pasireotide LAR (8 mg/kg) resulted in a pharmacologically active 
plasma level (49 ng/ml) within 24h and reached peak exposure after 28 days (94 ng/ml). At this dose, a strong 
(to  40%  of  control)  and  long-term  (49  days)  inhibition  of  plasma  IGF-1  was  obtained,  which  could  not  be 
enhanced by increasing the dose. A transient minor increase in plasma glucose was observed on day 1, but 
showed rapid tachyphylaxis. There were also effects on plasma glucagon levels (transient decrease) and plasma 
insulin (decrease remaining at 15 days, but after that showing normalization).  
It is not clear why the new in vivo study was conducted with sc instead of im injection, which is the intended 
clinical route of the LAR formulation. However, since plasma levels in a similar range were demonstrated after 
a  single  dose,  im  injection  with  the  LAR  formulation  (Study  R0600360),  the  study  results  obtained  with  sc 
injection are considered to apply also for im injection.  
In conclusion, the results  of a number of in  vitro  and in  vivo preclinical pharmacology studies suggest that 
pasireotide LAR has the potential to inhibit GH and IGF-1 secretion and thus be effective in the treatment of 
acromegaly.  Pharmacodynamic effects of pasireotide are reflcted in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A number of pharmacokinetic studies were submitted and assessed within the frame of the procedure for the 
initial MAA (EMEA/H/C/2052). These studies were conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys using sc 
and iv dosing. Since it is reasonable to assume that pharmacokinetic parameters apart from absorption would be 
similar for both LAR (long-acting release, im administration) and sc solution formulations, no new PK studies to 
evaluate  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  have  been  performed  by  the  Applicant  with  the  LAR 
formulation, im administration. This is considered acceptable.  
The  Applicant  has  conducted  a  single  dose  study  with  two  different  LAR  formulations  (2  and  2b),  using  im 
injection,  to  investigate  absorption  and  bioavailability  (Study  R0600360).  The  results  show  that  pasireotide 
embonate was well absorbed after im dosing in rats (absolute bioavailability 85% and 108%, respectively, for 
formulations  2  and  2b).  The  interanimal  variability  was  moderate  to  high;  however,  a  sustained  release  of 
pasireotide embonate up to Day 63 after a single im injection in rats could be demonstrated. Both formulations 
tested  caused  a  local  inflammatory  reaction  at  the  injection  site.  Similar  local  irritative  effects  have  been 
observed with pasireotide, sc solution, in all animal species investigated.  
The  Applicant  has  submitted  two  new  drug  transporter  studies,  studies  1200835  and  1200761,  on  the 
assessment of pasireotide as an inhibitor of human organic anion and cation transporters. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicological and toxicokinetic studies using pasireotide aspartate, sc solution, have previously been performed 
in  mice,  rats,  rabbits  and  monkeys.  These  studies  include  acute,  subchronic  and  chronic  toxicity  studies, 
carcinogenicity studies, reproductive toxicity studies, and in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies. The results of 
these studies are considered to be relevant also for pasireotide LAR. 
The Applicant has presented an exposure margins table for the carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies 
conducted with pasireotide, sc solution, using values from the healthy volunteer study with pasireotide LAR, 60 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 19/122 
  
  
 
 
 
mg. The animal/human exposure margins for pasireotide LAR are within the same range, although slightly lower, 
than those  for pasireotide sc solution.  
With regard to carcinogenicity, there were no tumour findings in mice or female rats. In male rats, fibroma was 
observed at the high dose level (10-fold margin based on AUC). This effect was linked to local irritation at the 
injection site. It should be noted that daily subcutaneous injection was applied in the rat carcinogenicity study. For 
pasireotide LAR, there will be only one monthly intramuscular injection and the injection site (as recommended in 
the  SmPC)  will  be  alternated  between  the  left  and  right  gluteal  muscle.  Thus,  there  will  be  no  continuous 
inflammatory reaction at the injection site, and the risk for development of fibroma is considered highly unlikely.   
For reproductive toxicity, pasireotide did not affect male fertility, but caused prolonged estrus cycles/acyclicity 
and a decreased mean numbers of corpora lutea in females due to the pharmacological activity (no NOAEL). 
Embryotoxicity  at  maternally  toxic  doses  was  seen  in  the  rat  and  rabbit,  but  no  teratogenic  potential  was 
detected  in  these  two  species  under  the  study  conditions.  A  slight  retardation  in  the  development  of  pinna 
detachment and reduced foetal body weight were observed in the prenatal-and-postnatal development study 
(no NOAEL). The wording under section 4.6 in the SmPC is identical to that of pasireotide sc solution and is 
considered adequate.  
To confirm the local and systemic effects of the LAR formulation, the Applicant has conducted local tolerance and 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats. All studies included toxicokinetics and were conducted in accordance with 
GLP.  
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies have been performed with the LAR formulation, im administration. The  single 
dose toxicity studies in mice and rats conducted with pasireotide sc formulation are considered sufficient to 
support the assessment of systemic acute toxicity of pasireotide in general, including the LAR formulation given 
by im administration. The maximum dose was 30 mg/kg (corresponding to 30 ml/kg as the maximum practical 
volume) which was non-lethal. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Two  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  (3  cycles/1  injection  per  month;  6  cycles/1  injection  per  month)  were 
conducted in rats with the LAR formulation, im administration. The majority of findings in these two studies are 
considered to reflect the pharmacology of pasireotide, as discussed below: 
Decreases in body weight/body weight gain and food consumption; effects on bone growth (inactive growth 
plates, atrophy of trabecular and compact bone): these effects are most likely related to pasireotide’s inhibitory 
effect on the secretion of GH from the pituitary gland. It is possible that the tibia fracture observed in a rat 
treated at 3.125 mg/injection pasireotide LAR in the 6-month study was caused by a weakness in the skeleton 
due to pasireotide’s effects on bone growth. Since bone growth is continuous in rodents, but not primates, and 
no skeletal findings were observed in nonhuman primates treated with pasireotide sc solution, these effects on 
bone are not considered relevant for adult patients. 
Decreased weight of the pituitary gland, correlated with atrophy/decreased acidophilia in pars distalis; increased 
zymogen granules in the exocrine pancreas; decreased weight of the adrenal gland, correlated with atrophy and 
cortical  vacuolation,  and  decreased  weight  of  the  thyroid  gland,  correlated  with  follicular  cell  atrophy  and 
attenuation  of  epithelium,  are  all  considered  to  be  effects  on  the  neuroendocrine  system  caused  by  the 
pharmacological mode of action of pasireotide. 
Effects  on  the  liver,  as  reflected  by  a  number  of  changes  in  clinical  chemistry  and  coagulation  parameters 
(increase in serum aspartate and alkaline phosphatase activity; decrease in total serum protein, globulin and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 20/122 
  
  
albumin; increased bilirubin and cholesterol; decreased fibrinogen; increased APTT) might be secondary to the 
effects of changes of pituitary GH production by pasireotide and resultant changes in the hepatic metabolism 
and production of coagulation factors. Transient increase in liver enzymes and coagulation factors has been 
shown in the clinic and measurements of these enzymes are recommended before and during treatment with 
Signifor in the SmPC section 4.4.  
Effects on kidney and excretion parameters (decreased urine volume, increased phosphorus, urea, sodium and 
chloride; decreased calcium and creatinine) have previously been observed in rat studies with pasireotide sc 
solution and are thought to be the result of pharmacologically mediated vasodilation, affecting renal blood flow 
and causing a decrease in the kidney filtration rate.   
Effects  on  hematology  parameters  and  bone  marrow:  decreased  cellularity  in  the  bone  marrow,  decreased 
numbers of lymphocytes, white blood cells, and platelets, might be related to the pharmacological properties of 
somatostatin analogues specifically due to the binding of these compounds to the receptors of hematopoietic 
precursor cells (CD34+ cells), monocytes and lymphocytes inhibiting the proliferation of these cells.  
Injection site erythema and inflammation: similar or more pronounced local irritative effects were previously 
observed  in  animal  studies  with  pasireotide  sc  solution  and  have  also  been  reported  in  patients  receiving 
pasireotide. There is a warning for these side effects in the SmPC. The increased numbers of neutrophils noted 
in some rats injected with pasireotide LAR are most likely related to local inflammatory reactions at the injection 
site.  In the 6-month rat study with pasireotide LAR, muscle atrophy at the injection site occurred at similar 
incidence and severity in the vehicle and placebo controls as compared to the pasireotide-treated groups.  
The  only  findings  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  with  pasireotide  LAR  not  previously  observed  with 
pasireotide  sc  solution  are  adrenal  atrophy/cortical  vacuolation,  decreased  platelets  and  decreased  glucose. 
These findings are most likely related to the pharmacology of pasireotide.  
In conclusion, most findings seen in repeat-dose toxicity studies with pasireotide LAR could be attributed to the 
pharmacology of pasireotide being a somatostatin analogue. There is not a complete overlap between findings 
in studies using the sc formulation and findings in the two repeat-dose toxicity studies with the LAR formulation; 
however, no significant new findings were observed with the LAR formulation. All observed findings were fully or 
partly reversible following cessation of dosing.  
Antigenicity  
Anti-drug antibodies were measured in the 3-month and 6-month repeat-dose toxicity studies with pasireotide 
LAR. In both studies, anti-drug antibodies were demonstrated (> 50% of animals in the 3-month study, 44% of 
animals in the 6-month study). As judged from the pharmacologic effects observed, these antibodies do not 
appear to have a neutralizing effect on pasireotide.  
Formulations and exposure margins 
The Applicant used various formulations in the non-clinical studies. Formulations A and B in the 3-month rat 
study  are  identical  to  formulations  2  and  2b,  respectively,  used  in  the  healthy  volunteer  study 
(CSOM230C2101).  Higher  exposure  levels  were  achieved  in  animals  with  formulation  2b/B,  which  probably 
explains why clinical chemistry changes were more pronounced in those animals as compared with rats treated 
with formulation 2/A. However, the incidence and severity of histopathological findings were similar regardless 
of the formulation used in the 3-month rat study.  
Based  on  TK  and  immunogenicity  data,  an  impact  of  anti-drug  antibodies  on  TK  data  was  observed. 
Immunogenicity in an assay system of the type employed (ELISA) typically leads to artificially high TK values, 
since the biotinylated pasireotide-tracer is captured by anti-pasireotide antibodies. Because of this, all margin

calculations  based  on  data  from  the  3-month  and  6-month  rat  studies  were  performed  using  the  systemic 
exposure after the 1st injection (presumably less affected by anti-drug antibody interference). At the low dose 
level of 3 mg/month (study 0770082), rats were 2.4- to 2.7-fold more exposed than humans and most effects 
were related to the pharmacological activity of pasireotide. There was no NOAEL to these effects, which is in line 
with the studies conducted in rats by the sc route (based on similar systemic pharmacological effects) whereas 
margins reached 39-55 in monkeys dosed sc.  
Local tolerance 
Single doses of pasireotide LAR im injection were generally well tolerated in rats and rabbits. Deposition of test 
substance  as  well  as  local  inflammation  occurred  at  the  injection  site  both  with  placebo  formulations  and 
pasireotide  LAR.  The  inflammatory  reaction  was  more  pronounced  with  pasireotide  LAR.  Recovery  was  not 
complete after 92 days, which is not uncommon with a granulomatous type of reaction. Similar local irritative 
effects  have  been  observed  with  pasireotide  sc  solution,  in  all  animal  species  investigated  (see  also  under 
Repeat-dose toxicity). 
Impurities 
The  Applicant  has  presented  an  acceptable  argumentation  for  acceptance  of  impurities  and  degradation 
products and specification limits of pasireotide embonate. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pasireotide PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log Kow 
does not exceed 4.5. However, based on the mechanism of action of pasireotide, potentially indicating endocrine 
activity,  and  also  on  the  fact  that  pasireotide  is  not  readily  biodregadable,  a  tailor-made  ERA  has  been 
conducted, including a fish early life-stage study and an amphibian metamorphosis assay. No significant toxicity 
has been observed in these studies and the most sensitive endpoint found was algae growth, leading to a risk 
ratio  of  0.0000532  for  surface  water.  In  conclusion,  pasireotide  is  not  expected  to  pose  a  risk  to  the 
environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pasireotide LAR has been shown to be pharmacologically active in rats and to produce a similar toxicological 
profile as pasireotide sc solution following repeat-dose administration up to 6 months (6 cycles of once monthly 
im injections). There were no significant new findings in the 3- and 6-month repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats 
with the LAR formulation. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There was no objection to an approval of Pasireotide LAR from a non-clinical perspective.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Note: Except for absorption, the distribution, metabolism and excretion properties of pasireotide between the 
Pasireotide  sc  formulation  (EMEA/H/C/002052)  and  the  Pasireotide  LAR  formulation  (this  application)  were 
considered to be similar (assuming linear pharmacokinetic processes based on the dose proportionality shown 
for pasireotide) because the same active entity (pasireotide) is present in both formulations.  
Consequently, data from the Pasireotide sc EPAR (EMEA/H/C/002052) and SmPC has been given when relevant.  
Regarding interactions, within the approval of Pasireotide sc, it was concluded based on in vitro data that the risk 
of pasireotide affecting other drugs was low and no in vivo studies were requested. This conclusion must also be 
considered valid for the LAR formulation given that the expected average maximum plasma concentrations at 
steady state is lower for the LAR formulation (19 ng/ml) than following Pasireotide sc (45 ng/ml).  
The PK of pasireotide LAR in healthy volunteers was characterized in five Phase I LAR single-dose studies. The 
PK and PK/PD of pasireotide LAR in acromegaly patients were characterized in one Phase I study and two Phase 
III  studies.  Full  PK  profiles  have  only  been  obtained  from  healthy  volunteers  whereas  sparse  sampling  was 
performed in the patient studies. 
Absorption: 
The average pasireotide PK profile following a single intramuscular LAR dose of 60 mg is shown below. The graph 
is based on data from a total of 114 healthy volunteers (Study C2111). 
Mean (SD) plasma concentration versus time profile for pasireotide LAR 60 mg in healthy 
volunteers C2111 
In most subjects, the PK profile shows an initial burst release on the injection day, followed by a dip from Day 2 
to Day 7, then a slow 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 25/122 
  
  
 
 
increase
to maximum concentration around Day 20, and a slow declining phase over the next weeks. 
No sign of significant dose dumping (except for the initial burst) was seen across studies. 
Absolute bioavailability of pasireotide has not been studied but data on relative bioavailability of pasireotide LAR 
compared to pasireotide sc was obtained from studies C2101, B2116 and C2112. The relative bioavailability was 
> 1 in all studies which may suggest that the absorption is higher following administration of LAR relative to that 
of  the  sc  formulation.  However,  the  difference  between  pasireotide  sc  and  LAR  data  may  be  possibly  be 
explained by difficulties in estimating AUCinf for LAR given the high variability seen in the concentration time 
curve.  Any  potential  difference  in  bioavailability  between  the  two  formulations/routes  of  administration  is 
nevertheless accounted for as the LAR formulation has been studied in a comprehensive phase III program. 
Regarding  formulation  development,  formulation  2b  has  been  used  in  all  clinical  studies,  and  also  is  the 
proposed market form. 
Distribution: 
In healthy volunteers, pasireotide is widely distributed with a large apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F >100 
litres). The distribution between blood cells and plasma is concentration independent and shows that pasireotide 
is  primarily  located  in  the  plasma  (91%).  Plasma  protein  binding  is  moderate  (88%)  and  independent  of 
concentration (based on the Signifor sc EPAR). 
Elimination: 
Across  studies,  the  effective  T1/2  was  approximately  12 hours  and  the  apparent  terminal  T1/2  was 
approximately 16 days.  
Across the patient studies, the accumulation ratio ranged between 1 and 2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 26/122 
  
  
 
The  main  elimination  pathway  is  hepatic  clearance  (biliary  excretion)  and  this  pathway  has  been  roughly 
estimated to account for approximately 86% of the dose, predominantly in the form of unchanged drug. In a 
human ADME study, pasireotide was predominantly found in unchanged form in plasma, urine and faeces. Also 
in vitro, pasireotide appears to be metabolically highly stable. Pasireotide contains 6 chiral carbon atoms and 
stereochemical  inter-conversion  in  vivo  is  unlikely.  Pasireotide  appears  to  be  metabolically  stable  with  little 
metabolism occurring and no metabolites in the systemic circulation (based on the Signifor sc EPAR). 
Across the healthy volunteers studies, the inter-subject variability (CV%) of Cmax,p1 ranged from 21.8% to 
73.0%, Cmax,p2 ranged from 20.6% to 53.4% and CV% of AUCinf ranged from 8.2% to 47.2%. 
Special populations: 
Based on data from the studies performed in patients, the MAH has performed numerous covariate analyses in 
the general form: 
Log (trough pasireotide concentration) = intercept (random subject effect) + covariates + error 
Body weight, gender and GGT levels were found to be statistically significant covariates in the final model for 
pasireotide  trough  concentration.    The  effects  were  not  considered  large  enough  to  warrant  specific  dose 
recommendations.  
Interactions (based on the Pasireotide sc EPAR and SmPC, except from the first sentence): 
Two new in vitro studies demonstrate that pasireotide is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OCT1 and OCT2. 
Based on in vitro data pasireotide appears to be a substrate of efflux transporter P-gp (P-glycoprotein). Based 
on in vitro data pasireotide is not a substrate of the efflux transporter BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) 
nor  of  the  influx  transporters  OCT1  (organic  cation  transporter  1),  OATP  (organic  anion-transporting 
polypeptide) 1B1, 1B3 or 2B1. At therapeutic dose levels pasireotide is also not an inhibitor of UGT1A1, OATP, 
1B1 or 1B3, P-gp, BCRP, MRP2 and BSEP. 
Based  on  in  vitro  inhibition  studies  it  is  considered  unlikely  that  pasireotide would  inhibit  CYP1A2,  CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5 in vivo. Furthermore, pasireotide is not expected to 
induce enzymes regulated via the Ah receptor, CAR or PXR.  
In  general  the  interaction  potential  for  pasireotide  appears  low  since  there  are  no  strong  indications  that 
pasireotide would inhibit or induce enzymes or transporter proteins. Furthermore, pasireotide is mainly excreted 
unchanged via bile. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Natural  somatostatin  is  a  peptide  hormone  that  is  widely  distributed  in  the  neural,  endocrine  and  immune 
system. Somatostatin action is mediated through five different somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtypes (SSTR1 
through  SSTR5).  All  SSTRs  belong  to  the  superfamily  of  G-protein  coupled  receptors.  They  are  expressed 
throughout the body in different tissues and cell types, with single cells expressing one or more subtypes at 
different densities.  
The physiological actions of natural somatostatin are diverse. It is an important inhibitory regulator of endocrine 
and exocrine secretion of various organs, including the pituitary, pancreas, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, thyroid, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 27/122 
  
  
 
kidney, and adrenal glands. It modulates GI function (including bowel motility and absorption of nutrients), 
inhibits gallbladder contractility and bile flow, and stimulates GI water and electrolyte absorption. It also inhibits 
cell proliferation and activated immune cells, and promotes apoptosis. 
Pasireotide  (SOM230)  is  a  second-generation  SSA.  It  has  a  broader  SSTR  binding  profile  than  the 
first-generation SSAs octreotide and lanreotide, with high affinity to four of the five receptors (SSTR1, 2, 3 and 
5). Thus its binding profile is closer to that of natural somatostatin, which has similar affinity to all five receptor 
subtypes.  Compared  to  octreotide,  the  binding  affinity  of  pasireotide  is  30-40  times  greater  for  SSTR1  and 
SSTR5 and 5 times greater for SSTR3, whereas the affinity for SSTR2 is similar. Based on this SSTR binding 
profile,  pasireotide  is  expected  to  be  more  efficacious  than  octreotide  or  lanreotide  in  acromegaly,  both  in 
patients with de novo disease and in those resistant to prior SSA.  
Primary pharmacology 
The main efficacy assessments were performed by normalization of GH and IGF-1 levels. Exposure-response 
relationship  between  pasireotide  LAR  concentrations  and  GH/IGF-1  levels  in  medically  naïve  acromegaly 
patients or inadequately controlled acromegaly patients are discussed in later parts of this report. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Hyperglycaemia: HbA1c and FPG 
A summary of the 3 key mechanistic studies conducted in healthy volunteers to investigate the mechanism of 
pasireotide-induced hyperglycaemia and its management is provided below.  
Study B2107, a single-center, open-label, dose escalation study conducted in male healthy volunteers evaluated 
the  effect  of  repeated  administration  of  pasireotide  sc  (single  and  multiple  doses)  on  glucose,  insulin  and 
glucagon profiles. Results showed that in the fasting state, pasireotide induced a marked decrease in insulin, a 
smaller decrease in glucagon and an increase in FPG. When pasireotide was given after a breakfast meal, the 
decrease in insulin was smaller than in the fasting  state. There appeared to be attenuation of the effects of 
pasireotide as glucose values on Day 7 tended to be lower relative to corresponding values of Day 1. 
Study  B2216  was  an  investigator-initiated  phase  2,  double-blinded,  single-center  study  conducted  in  male 
healthy  volunteers.  Results  demonstrated  that the  hyperglycaemia  is  primarily  a  consequence  of  decreased 
secretion  of  insulin  and  incretins  (glucagon-like  peptide  1  (GLP-1)  and  glucose-dependent  insulinotropic 
polypeptide (GIP), with  no changes in  hepatic or peripheral  insulin sensitivity. No  dose  related effects were 
observed. 
The hyperglycaemic effect is in line with receptor binding profile of pasireotide. In humans, inhibition of insulin 
secretion from pancreatic islet cells is mediated mainly by SSTR2 and SSTR5, whereas the inhibition of glucagon 
secretion is mediated almost entirely by SSTR2. Higher affinity of pasireotide to SSTR5 than SSTR2 leads to 
relatively  stronger  inhibition  of  insulin  than  glucagon,  which  explains  the  stronger  hyperglycaemic  effect 
observed with pasireotide compared to other somatostatin analogues that bind avidly to SSTR2, but have lower 
binding affinity for SSTR5. 
Study B2124, a randomized, single-center, open-label phase 1 study conducted in male healthy volunteers was 
initiated  to  better  understand  the  effects  of  different  anti-hyperglycaemic  agents  used  in  combination  with 
pasireotide. The results confirmed that the underlying mechanisms of hyperglycaemia following pasireotide sc 
treatment  in  humans  are  mainly  due  to  decreased  insulin  secretion  and  reduced  GLP-1  and  GIP  incretin 
secretion with no changes in hepatic or peripheral insulin sensitivity. Results demonstrated that incretin based 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 28/122 
  
  
therapies (i.e. GLP-1 analogues and DPP-4 inhibitors) are the most promising agents in the management of 
pasireotide-induced hyperglycaemia. 
PK/PD analyses of pasireotide concentration and FPG and HbA1c levels indicated that the risk that a patient 
develops  hyperglycaemia  increases  with  higher  pasireotide  exposure;  a  1.5-fold  increase  (corresponding  to 
dose increase from 40 mg to 60 mg) in trough concentration increased the odds of hyperglycaemia (defined as 
FPG change from baseline >36 mg/dL) by 21% in medically naïve patients and 36% in inadequately controlled 
patients. Higher baseline HbA1c was found to increase the risk of hyperglycaemia.  
Cardiac safety: QT intervals  
Healthy volunteers – sc bid doses 
Two TQT studies, Study B2113 and Study B2125 were conducted with the pasireotide sc formulation in healthy 
volunteers.  Study B2113 was conducted to determine whether pasireotide sc, at the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD), has an effect on cardiac repolarization. The study showed a maximum placebo-subtracted QTcF change 
from baseline of 17.5 ms at the supratherapeutic dose of 1950 µg bid. Pasireotide treatment was associated with 
heart rate (HR) decreases up to 4 hours post-dose (maximum change from baseline of 10.7 bpm).  
A second TQT study Study B2125 was conducted to further characterize the impact of pasireotide on QTc. Given 
the observed bradycardia effect with pasireotide in Study B2113, an individual QT correction for HR (QTcI) was 
used.  Study B2125  encompassed  2  pasireotide  dose  levels  (a  therapeutic  dose  of  600  µg  bid  and  a 
supra-therapeutic dose of 1950 µg bid). 
The results from Study B2125 were consistent with those from Study B2113, and confirmed that pasireotide is 
associated  with  QT  interval  prolongation  and  bradycardia  in  healthy  volunteers  at  therapeutic  and 
supra-therapeutic doses. The maximal placebo-subtracted change from baseline in QTcI was 13.19 ms (600 µg 
bid)  and  16.12  ms  (1950  µg  bid)  at  2 hours  post  dose,  ~1.5  hours  later  than  the  peak  in  pasireotide 
concentration which was observed at ~0.5 hour. This delay between maximal drug concentration and QT effect 
suggests  that  pasireotide  does  not  interact  directly  with  cardiac  ion  channels,  which  is  consistent  with  the 
absence of a signal for QT prolongation in preclinical studies. 
The dose-response effect for QTc prolongation was relatively flat between pasireotide doses 600 µg bid and 
1950 µg bid. The small difference between the 2 doses in terms QTcI prolongation (i.e. 13 vs. 16 ms) suggests 
that the pasireotide QTcI effect is reaching a plateau in this dose range (corresponding to a concentration range 
of 25 to 90 ng/mL). 
For pasireotide sc formulation, the observed Cmax,ss (mean±SD) at the supra-therapeutic dose of 1950 µg bid 
(as MTD; maximum tolerated dose) was comparable between Study B2113 and Study B2125: 80.3±15.8 ng/mL 
(Study  B2113; Part  I, n=6) and 67.5±27.5  ng/mL  (Study  B2113;  Part  II,  n=84), versus 80.6±25.3  ng/mL 
(Study  B2125;  n=103).  The  Cmax,ss  for  the  therapeutic  dose  of  600  µg  bid  was  24.3±7.20  ng/mL  (Study 
B2125; n=105). 
For pasireotide LAR formulation, the mean values of predicted Cmax,ss for the highest  therapeutic doses in 
acromegaly patients would be 18.8 ng/mL (60 mg for patients with normal liver function) and 19.7 ng/mL (40 
mg for patients with moderate hepatic impairment). As such, Cmax,ss 80.6 ng/mL from sc MTD 1950 µg bid in 
healthy volunteers (Study B2125) has approximately 4-fold coverage for Cmax,ss from the highest therapeutic 
doses of LAR formulation in acromegaly patients.

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
GH and IGF-1 response in patients with acromegaly 
The PK/PD relationship between pasireotide concentrations and GH/IGF-1 levels was explored using an 
inhibitory effect Emax model and a repeated measures logistic regression analysis.  
The exposure-response analyses demonstrated a positive correlation between pasireotide exposure and efficacy 
endpoints (GH, IGF-1 and overall GH+IGF-1 response) for both medically naïve and inadequately controlled 
patients.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PK 
The applicant has characterized the pasireotide PK profile following LAR administration.  
In most subjects, the PK profile shows an initial burst release on the injection day, followed by a dip from Day 2 
to Day 7, then a slow increase to maximum concentration around Day 20, and a slow declining phase over the 
next weeks. 
Except for absorption, the distribution, metabolism and excretion properties of pasireotide between the Signifor 
sc and the LAR formulation are expected to be similar (assuming linear pharmacokinetic processes based on the 
dose  proportionality  shown  for  pasireotide)  because  the  same  active  entity  (pasireotide)  is  present  in  both 
formulations. 
Regarding interactions, within the approval of pasireotide sc, it was concluded based on in vitro data that the risk 
of pasireotide affecting other drugs was low and no in vivo studies were requested. This conclusion must also be 
considered valid for the LAR formulation given that the expected average (based on simulations of single dose 
data from healthy volunteers) maximum plasma concentrations at steady state is lower for the LAR formulation 
(26 ng/ml) than following pasireotide sc (45 ng/ml).  
The pharmacokinetic documentation for pasireaotide LAR is considered sufficient. 
PD 
The physiological actions of somatostatin are well known. Pasireotide is a somatostatin analogue with affinity to 
four of the five described somatostatin receptors (SSTR), thus the binding profile differs somewhat from the 
somatostatin  analogues  octreotide  and  lanreotide  currently  approved  in  the  treatment  of  acromegaly.  The 
difference in binding profile makes it plausible that a difference in both efficacy and secondary pharmacological 
characteristics can be expected compared to octreotide and lanreotide. 
Somatostatin analogues are known to affect the glucose metabolism through their effects on the pancreatic 
islets. The data presented with the MAA for the sc formulation of pasireotide show that pasireotide decreased 
insulin secretion and reduced GLP-1 and GIP incretin secretion with no changes in hepatic or peripheral insulin 
sensitivity.  Further  data  was  presented  indicating  that  incretin  based therapies  may  be  the  most  promising 
agents in the treatment of hyperglycaemia. With the current application, PK/PD analyses have been provided, 
indicating a dose-related risk of hyperglycaemia.  
The two thorough QT studies were assessed with the MAA for the sc pasireotide formulation. In this assessment 
it was concluded that there was a positive correlation between ΔΔQTcF and pasireotide plasma concentration. 
Pasireotide-treated subjects also showed a reduction of the heart rate.  The Applicant has  provided relevant

arguments  that  the  results  from  the  two  TQT  studies  conducted  with  the  sc  formulation  are  adequate  and 
sufficient to characterize the potential effect of the LAR formulation on QT intervals. An exploratory dynamic QT 
beat-to-beat  analysis  was  provided  with  the  new  submission  indicating  that  pasireotide  may  have  a  low 
arrhythmia liability. However, due to the exploratory nature of this analysis, no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
The effect of pasireotide LAR on QT was evaluated in the clinical studies and is further discussed in the safety 
section of this report. 
Exploratory exposure–response analyses were performed. An inhibitory Emax-model was used to describe the 
dependence  of  GH  and  IGF-1  on  pasireotide  concentrations  assuming  a  direct  relationship  between  plasma 
concentrations  and  the  effect.  Based  on  the  presented  data  it  may  be  concluded  that  higher  exposure  is 
associated  with  greater  GH  and  IGF-1  suppression.  Different  EC50-estimates  were  found  for  the  different 
studies  which  may  be  a  reflection  of  the  different  underlying  disease  status.  The  results  from  the 
exposure-response  analysis  support  the  approach  of  dose  escalation  in  patients  not  achieving  sufficient 
treatment response.  
Considering the effects of pasireotide on the glucose  metabolism, interactions with anti-diabetic medications 
may  be  foreseen.  Study  B2124,  which  was  submitted  with  the  MAA  for  the  sc  pasireotide  formulation,  was 
designed to define the potential role of different class of anti-hyperglycaemic agents (metformin, nateglinide, 
vildagliptin and liraglutide) in the management of hyperglycaemia induced by pasireotide. The most prominent 
antihyperglycaemic  effect  was  observed  with  liraglutide  and  vildagliptin  with  the  least  effect  observed  for 
metformin. The safety assessment of the combination therapies revealed no unforeseen adverse events and the 
combinations  were  moderately  well  tolerated.  Notably  increases  in  hepatic  enzymes/bilirubin  were  more 
common in the pasireotide + liraglutide arm indicating that this may not be a favourable combination. These 
data  are,  however,  not  considered  sufficient  to  allow  any  specific  recommendations  with  regards  to 
pasireotide-induced  hyperglycaemia.  A  study  investigating  the  management  of  pasireotide-induced 
hyperglycaemia in patients with Cushing’s disease and acromegaly is planned and the study protocol has been 
assessed by the CHMP. The study is further included in the RMP (category 3). 
With reference to pharmacodynamic interactions, and further to the assessment of the QT studies, a statement 
on the risk of bradycardia potentiation when this drug is combined with a bradycardic agent is included in section 
4.5  of  the  SmPC.  Furthermore,  information  on  the  need  for  dose  adjustments  of  insulin  and  antidiabetic 
medicinal products is included in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers all relevant aspects on the pharmacodynamic effects of pasireotide LAR to be adequately 
covered. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy studies are summarized in Table 1 (see section clinical aspects – introduction). 
The efficacy and safety of pasireotide LAR in acromegaly are primarily derived from two Phase 3, randomized 
studies  comparing  pasireotide  LAR  with  active  controls,  Study  SOM230C2305  and  Study  SOM230C2402. 
Supportive efficacy and safety data in the acromegaly indication are available from Study SOM230C2110 with its 
Assessment report

extension  Study  SOM230C2110E1  using  the  LAR  formulation,  and  from  Study  SOM230B2103  and  Study 
SOM230B2201 with its extension Study SOM230B2201E3 using the sc formulation.  
No pooling of data was performed due to significant differences in study design. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The choice of the pasireotide LAR dose regimen in Study C2305 and Study C2402 was based on the PK and 
PK/PD analysis results from Study B2201 and Study C2110. 
In Study B2201, pasireotide sc was tested at 200, 400 and 600 µg bid dose levels in patients with acromegaly. 
The  response  rates  appeared  to  be  dose-dependent  for  pasireotide  sc  at  200  µg  bid  (14.3%),  400  µg  bid 
(11.8%) and 600 µg bid (30.0%), suggesting pasireotide sc 600 µg bid and higher dose levels should be tested 
in further clinical development.  
In Study C2110, pasireotide LAR was tested at 20, 40 and 60 mg q28d in patients with acromegaly. Interim 
analysis of PK data from this study showed that the trough concentrations of pasireotide at steady-state (Day 
84) were 2.74 ± 1.33, 5.92 ± 2.85, and 8.87 ± 4.53 ng/mL following three monthly im injections of 20 mg, 40 
mg, and 60 mg LAR, respectively. The mean values of pasireotide trough concentrations after 40 mg dose (5.92 
ng/mL) and 60 mg dose (8.87 ng/mL) from Study C2110 were above the mean value of Ceffective (5.09 ng/ml) 
from pasireotide sc on GH reduction <2.5 g/L in Study B2201. In addition, in terms of monthly dose loading, 
the LAR formulation 40 mg monthly (q28d) dosing is the closest dose strength to the sc formulation 600 µg bid 
(i.e. 1.2 mg/day x 28 days = 33.6 mg every 28 days). Based on these results, a 40 mg pasireotide LAR dose was 
chosen as the starting dose for Phase 3 Study C2305. 
Due  to  inter-patient  variability  in  PK  exposures,  PD  (GH  and  IGF-1)  response,  and  safety/tolerability,  it  is 
expected that some patients may require lower or higher doses of pasireotide LAR. In Study C2305, for patients 
who did not respond to pasireotide LAR 40 mg after three months of treatment, when it was considered that the 
trough concentration was close to steady state, a dose increase to 60 mg was permitted. In Study C2402, a dose 
decrease in 20 mg increments and in Study C2305 a dose reduction to pasireotide LAR 20 mg or octreotide LAR 
10 mg was permitted at any time in the event of tolerability issues. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Medically naïve patients - Study C2305 
Study C2305 is a large prospective randomized study conducted in patients with acromegaly. This was a Phase 
3,  multicenter,  randomized,  blinded  study  of  pasireotide  LAR  vs.  octreotide  LAR  in  patients  with  active 
acromegaly who had not received previous medical treatment.  
Inadequately controlled patients - Study C2402 
Study C2402 is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, three-arm study of double-blind pasireotide 
LAR 40 mg and pasireotide LAR 60 mg versus open-label octreotide LAR 30 mg or lanreotide ATG 120 mg in 
patients with inadequately controlled acromegaly.

Methods 
Study C2305 
This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, blinded study assessed the safety and efficacy of pasireotide LAR 40 mg 
vs.  octreotide  LAR  20  mg  in  358  patients  with  active  acromegaly  who  had  not  received  previous  medical 
treatment.  
Enrollment was stratified by the following two strata: 1) patients who had undergone one or more pituitary 
surgeries but had not been treated medically and 2) de-novo patients presenting a visible pituitary adenoma on 
MRI and who refuse pituitary surgery or for whom pituitary surgery was contraindicated. 
The study consisted of two blinded study phases: a 12 month core phase and an optional extension (Figure 1). 
Figure 1 C2305 Study design (incorporating Amendment 4) 
Core phase: Treatment in the core was blinded for all patients. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either 
pasireotide LAR 40 mg im or octreotide LAR 20 mg im depot injections every 28 days for a total of 12 injections 
in the core. The total duration of the core was 12 times 28 days, i.e. 12 study months. All patients had to have 
follow-up evaluations 28 days after the End of Study visit (56 days after the last dose of study medication). 
Extension  phase:  At  the  discretion  of  the  Investigator,  patients  who  did  not  respond  to  their  randomized 
treatment (i.e. pasireotide LAR or octreotide LAR) at the end of the core (Month 12) were allowed to switch to 
receive  the  other  treatment  in  the  extension,  and  those  who  were  responders  continued  with  the  same 
treatment as in the core.  
Data from Study C2305 are presented in three categories: 
•  Core phase: includes all data from the core phase up to Month 12 (primary efficacy analysis). 
•  Up to crossover: includes data from both core and extension up to data cut-off collected for patients 
who  continued  the  same  treatment  as  in  the  core.  For  patients  who  switched  medication  only  data 
collected before crossover is included. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 33/122 
  
  
 
 
•  After crossover: includes all data in the extension collected after the crossover time point for patients 
who crossed over (efficacy and safety for patients who did not achieve biochemical control with previous 
SSA treatment in the core phase). These analyses correspond to inadequately controlled patients. 
Study C2402 
This was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, three-arm study of double-blind pasireotide LAR 
40 mg and pasireotide LAR 60 mg versus open-label octreotide LAR 30 mg or lanreotide ATG 120 mg in patients 
with inadequately controlled acromegaly. The study consisted of a core and extension phase (Figure 2). The 
originally submitted clinical study report presents data of the core phase. With the responses to the Day 120 
LoQ, interim data from the extension phase was submitted with a data cut-off date of 03-Jun-2013. 
Core phase 
After a 4-week screening period where inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed, patients were randomly 
allocated  to  receive  either  pasireotide  LAR  40  mg  or  pasireotide  LAR  60  mg  (in  double-blind  fashion)  or  to 
continue on the same treatment on the maximum indicated dose of octreotide LAR 30 mg or lanreotide ATG 120 
mg as before randomization (in an open-label, active control arm). 
Patients were stratified according to previous treatment (octreotide LAR, lanreotide ATG) and GH levels at Visit 
1 (screening, >2.5 μg/L and ≤ 10 μg/L; and >10 μg/L). The total treatment duration with pasireotide LAR 40 mg 
or pasireotide LAR 60 mg or with octreotide LAR 30 mg or lanreotide ATG 120 mg was 24 weeks. The total study 
duration was 28 weeks, including the screening phase. 
Extension phase 
The  purpose  of  the  extension  study  is  to  collect  additional  efficacy  and  safety  data  with  pasireotide  LAR. 
Available data from the extension study with a data cut-off date of 03-Jun-2013 has been submitted. In this 
interim analysis of data 83 % of patients included had reached Week 28 of the extension.

Treatments 
Study C2305 
Core phase 
For the core phase of the study, patients were randomized to one of the following 2 treatment arms in a ratio of 
1:1: 
•  Pasireotide LAR 40 mg im depot injection, blinded, once every 28 days (± 2 days) for 12 months. 
•  Octreotide LAR 20 mg im depot injection, blinded, once every 28 days (± 2 days) for 12 months. 
Dose increase and decrease were permitted. 
Extension phase 
The starting dose in the extension for patients who crossed over was pasireotide LAR 40 mg or octreotide LAR 
20  mg.  Patients  who  entered  the  extension  without  crossing  over  continued  the  same  dose  as  they  were 
receiving in the core. 
Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment 
A patient’s dose could be increased one dose level during the core or the extension if central laboratory results 
showed mean GH level ≥ 2.5 μg/L and/or IGF-1 >ULN (age and sex related). The permitted dose increases were 
from 40 mg to 60 mg for pasireotide LAR, and from 20 to 30 mg for octreotide LAR. 
Dose decrease to pasireotide LAR 20 mg or octreotide LAR 10 mg was permitted at any time in the event of 
tolerability issues. 
For  patients  who  were  unable  to  tolerate  the  protocol-specified  dosing  scheme,  dose  adjustments  and 
interruptions  were  permitted  in  order  to  keep  the  patient  on  study  drug.  Guidelines  for  dose 
adjustments/interruptions for patients experiencing adverse events (AEs) or QTc prolongation were in place. 
Further guidance on treating patients in case of hyperglycaemia and QT-related cardiology was provided. 
Study C2402 
For the core phase, patients were randomized to one of the following three treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1:1: 
•  Double-blind pasireotide LAR 40 mg intramuscular (i.m.) injection, once every 28±2 days for 24 weeks 
•  Double-blind pasireotide LAR 60 mg i.m. injection, once every 28±2 days for 24 weeks 
•  Active, open-label control arm: Continuation on the same treatment that was received for at least 6 
months prior to randomization with either octreotide LAR 30 mg i.m. injection or lanreotide ATG 120 mg 
subcutaneous (s.c.) once every 28±2 days for 24 weeks. 
For the extension, patients originally randomized to pasireotide arms who achieved biochemical control at the 
end of the core phase could continue on the same dose of double-blind pasireotide LAR as long as biochemical 
control was maintained. Patients who were not biochemically controlled at the end of the core phase (following 
treatment with either pasireotide LAR 40 mg or 60 mg) were offered to continue on open-label pasireotide LAR 
60 mg in the extension. Patients originally randomized to the active control arm in the core period who did not 
achieve biochemical control at the end of the 24-week treatment period were started on open-label pasireotide 
LAR 40 mg in the extension. The dose could then be increased to 60 mg should biochemical control not be 
achieved after 3 months. 
Assessment report

Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment 
For patients who were unable to tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule in the pasireotide LAR treatment 
arms, dose adjustments were permitted in order to keep the patients on study drug. Patients randomized to the 
pasireotide LAR treatment arms who did not tolerate the assigned 40 mg or 60 mg dose were permitted to 
decrease their dose by 20 mg. 
As octreotide LAR 30 mg and lanreotide ATG 120 mg were already used in their maximum indicated doses for at 
least 24 weeks prior to randomization, no further dose adjustments were expected.

Objectives 
Study C2305 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the proportion of patients with a reduction of mean GH 
level to < 2.5µg/L and the normalization of IGF-1 to within normal limits (age and sex related) between 
pasireotide LAR vs octreotide LAR at 12 months. 
Key secondary objectives were to compare the effect of pasireotide LAR vs octreotide LAR on reduction of GH 
to < 2.5 µg/L, tumour volume and normalization of IGF-1 at 12 months. 
Study C2402 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients achieving biochemical control 
(defined as mean GH levels <2.5 μg/L and normalization of sex- and age-adjusted IGF-1) at 24 weeks with 
pasireotide LAR 40 mg and pasireotide LAR 60 mg separately versus continued treatment with octreotide LAR 30 
mg or lanreotide autogel (ATG) 120 mg. 
Key secondary objective were to compare the effect of pasireotide LAR (40 mg and 60 mg separately) versus 
continued treatment with octreotide LAR 30 mg or lanreotide ATG 120 mg on the proportion of patients 
achieving normalization of sex- and age adjusted IGF-1 at 24 weeks. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Study C2305 
GH (5-point mean GH level): A patients’ 5-point mean GH level was assessed from a 2-hour profile after one 
hour at rest at the hospital and before the LAR injection, if applicable. All GH 2 hour profiles prior to glucose 
intake were to be taken at the same time (morning at around 8 am). 
As all GH assessments were based on the mean of a 5-point 2-hour profile, the term "GH" is used to denote 
"mean GH (based on a 5-point 2 hour profile)". 
IGF-1: A patient’s total IGF-1 levels were assessed at specified time points. Sampling for IGF-1 was performed 
immediately before the LAR injection, if applicable.  
The GH and IGF-1 samples were analyzed by the central laboratory. 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using gadolinium as contrast material: An MRI of the pituitary was 
performed  at  screening,  at  Month  6,  at  Month  12  (core  study  completion)  and  then  every  6  months  in  the 
extension. For de-novo patients an adenoma had to be visible on screening MRI. The MRIs were evaluated by a 
blinded central reader. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 38/122 
  
  
To ensure consistency throughout all participating sites, the MRIs were performed and processed following the 
guidelines from the central reader facility. 
Symptoms  of  acromegaly: Ring size and symptoms of acromegaly were collected monthly in the core, the 
first 6 months in the extension, and every 3 months thereafter in the extension. The investigator also asked the 
patient  to  score  the  following  symptoms  of  acromegaly:  headache,  fatigue,  perspiration,  paresthesias, 
osteoarthralgia  according  to  a  five-point  score  scale  (0=absent,  1=mild,  2=moderate,  3=severe,  4=very 
severe) 
Quality of Life: Health related quality of life information was collected monthly in the core and every 6 months 
in  the  extension  using  the  Acromegaly  Quality  of  Life  Questionnaire  (AcroQoL).  The  questionnaire  is 
unidimensional and contains 22 items divided in two scales: one that evaluates physical aspects (eight items) 
and another one that evaluates psychological aspects (14 items). This last one is also divided in two 7-item 
sub-scales:  one  evaluates  physical  appearance,  and  the  other  evaluates  the  impact  of  the  disease  on  the 
personal relationships of the patient. 
Prolactin: PRL levels were assessed every 3 months in the core and extension. Sampling for PRL was performed 
immediately before the LAR injection, if applicable.  
The PRL samples were analyzed by the central laboratory. 
Study C2402 
Primary efficacy assessments 
GH (5-point mean GH level): The 5-point mean GH was assessed from a 2-hour profile after one hour at rest 
at  the  hospital  at  Visit  1  (Screening),  Visit  2  (baseline),  Visit  6  (Week  12),  and  Visit  10  (Week  24,  study 
completion). All GH assessments were based on such a profile.  
The 5-point mean GH profile was done within a 2-hour time period prior to glucose intake when an OGTT was 
required.  
All GH 2-hour profiles were taken at the same time in the morning. The samples for GH were analyzed by the 
central laboratory. 
IGF-1: Total IGF-1 levels were assessed with one pre-dose sample at the same visits as GH. Blood sampling for 
IGF-1 was done prior to the administration of both study drug/active control and glucose, when applicable. This 
sample was taken together with the first sample of the GH profile. The samples for IGF-1 were analyzed by the 
central laboratory. 
All IGF-1 assessments are reported as standardized IGF-1, adjusted for sex and age.  
Secondary efficacy assessments 
GH and IGF-1: Both values (in combination or alone) were used to assess secondary efficacy parameters at 
different time points. 
Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  using  gadolinium  as  contrast  material:  An  MRI  of  the  pituitary  was 
performed during the screening period if possible only after patient’s eligibility for the study was confirmed and 
at Visit 10 (study completion). The MRIs were sent to a central reader for evaluation. To ensure consistency 
throughout all participating sites, the MRIs were performed and processed following the guidelines from the 
central reader facility.

Symptoms of acromegaly: At all visits (except Visits 3 and 7), the Investigator measured the patient’s ring 
size  using  a  provided  gauge.  The  Investigator  also  asked  the  patient  to  score  the  following  symptoms  of 
acromegaly: headache, fatigue, perspiration, paresthesias, and osteoarthralgia according to a five-point score 
scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe). 
Health-related quality of life: Health-related quality of life was assessed at Visit 2 (baseline), 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 
and 10 using the AcroQoL instrument. The AcroQoL instrument was comprised of 22 questions divided into two 
scales: one evaluating physical aspects (8 items) and one addressing psychological aspects (14 items). The 
psychological scale was further divided into a subscale evaluating physical appearance and a subscale focusing 
on the impact of the disease on personal relationships of the patient (7 items each).

Sample size 
Study C2305 
In previous clinical studies with octreotide LAR in patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly (CSMS995B2401, 
CSMS995B2402), a 25% response rate (GH <2.5 μg/L and IGF-1 within the age and sex adjusted normal range) 
was observed along with a 95% CI of 10.2%, 39.8%. 
In the current study patients who were medical treatment naïve after first surgery were also eligible and the 
response rate data in this stratum is not known from previous studies, however comparable response rates are 
expected. Considering the relatively wide confidence interval of the response rate from the previous studies and 
the potential of early withdrawal to dilute the treatment effect, a lower overall response rate for the octreotide 
group (20%) is assumed in both strata. 
A Phase II cross-over study in acromegaly (CSOM230B2201) showed a 39% response rate across pasireotide sc 
doses ranging from 200 μg bid to 600 μg bid. At the 600 μg bid dose level, the response rate was 36% across 
all  time  periods  in  this  study.  Therefore,  a  35%  response  is  assumed  as  the  minimal  response  rate  for  the 
pasireotide LAR group. It was assumed that 75 % and 25 % of patients, respectively, would enroll in the strata 
of treatment naïve after first surgery and newly diagnosed acromegaly patients. To detect an increase of 15% 
in response rate from 20% in octreotide LAR group to a 35% in pasireotide LAR group  within each stratum 
(equivalently odds ratio equals 2.154), a sample size of 151 patients per group would be adequate based on a 
two-sided CMH test at the 0.05 level with 80% power. Considering a possible 9% dropout rate in this study, a 
sample size of 330 (165 patients/group) was needed. 
Study C2402 
Response rate data (GH <2.5 μg/L and IGF-1 within the age and sex adjusted normal range) in this patient 
population were not available from previous studies with pasireotide. However, since patients recruited were 
inadequately  controlled  from  prior  treatment,  the  response  rate  was  expected  to  be  lower  than  in 
medically-naïve or newly diagnosed patients with acromegaly. The expected response rates and their difference 
(considered clinically significant) for this study were conjectured by a medical expert. 
The sample size calculation was based on the primary efficacy variable (GH <2.5 μg/L and IGF-1 within the age 
and sex adjusted normal range at 24 weeks). The assumptions for the sample size calculation were as follows: 
•  Response rates at Week 24 for pasireotide LAR groups (40 mg and 60 mg separately) were assumed to 
be 25% 
•  Response rate at Week 24 for the active control group (continuing on same treatment) was assumed to 
be 5% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 40/122 
  
  
The statistical null hypotheses of the primary efficacy variable were: 
A sample size of 62 patients per treatment group (pasireotide LAR 60 mg, pasireotide LAR 40 mg, and active 
control (octreotide LAR 30 mg or lanreotide ATG 120 mg)) achieved 90% power to detect a difference of 20% in 
response rate between active control (5%) and pasireotide LAR (40 mg and 60 mg separately) (25%) with a 
family-wise error rate of 2.5% (one-sided). 
• 
Randomisation 
Study C2305 
At Visit 2, all eligible patients were randomized using an interactive voice recognition system (IVRS) to one of 
the treatment arms according to the specified strata. The unblinded independent nurse/study coordinator called 
the IVRS after the investigator had confirmed that the patient fulfilled all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The 
IVRS identified the treatment assigned to the patient based on a randomization list. The IVRS communicated 
only the treatment the patient was assigned to, but did not reveal the randomization number. 
Randomization was stratified by 2 strata (i.e. patients who had prior pituitary surgery (but had not been treated 
medically) and patients with de novo disease). Within each stratum block randomization was used. Treatment 
assignment was balanced by country. 
Study C2402 
In  order  to  randomize  the  patient  to  one  of  the  three  treatment  arms  an  Interactive  Voice  Response 
System/Interactive Web Response System (IVRS/IWRS) was used. The IVRS/IWRS assigned a randomization 
number to the patient, which was used to link the patient to a treatment arm.  
The randomization number in either situation was not communicated to the caller.  
A specific procedure was used to ensure that treatment assignment was unbiased and concealed from patients 
and investigator staff. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
Study C2305 
Due  to  the  different  appearance  of  the  pasireotide  and  octreotide  LAR  formulations,  a  true  double-blind 
treatment was not feasible. Blinding was achieved by having a dedicated independent nurse/coordinator call the 
IVRS, prepare and administer the LAR treatment and complete the Unblinded Dosage Administration Record 
case  report  form  (CRF).  This  nurse/coordinator  was  not  blinded  to  the  treatment  assignment.  The  patient, 
investigator,  and  sponsor  were  blinded  to  treatment  assignment.  The  nurse/study  coordinator  was  not  to 
discuss treatment assignment with the patient or the investigator or the sponsor’s clinical monitor. 
Also the persons performing the central assessments and data analyses remained blinded to the identity of the 
treatment. 
For patients not continuing in the extension phase of the study, the treatment was unblinded after Month 12. 
Patients who entered the extension before Amendment 4 was implemented received unblinded treatment in the 
extension  (from  Month  12).  Amendment  4  extended  blinding  to  patients'  treatment  from  Month  12 
(end-of-core) to Month 26 in the extension. For patients continuing in the extension phase of the study after 
Amendment 4 was implemented, the treatment was unblinded at Month 26. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 41/122 
  
  
Blinded and open-label data 
All  data  in  the  core  phase  was  collected  in  a  blinded  manner.  Following  implementation  of  Amendment  4, 
treatment in the extension was blinded up to Month 26, after which patients on pasireotide could continue on 
open-label  treatment.  In  addition,  patients  who  entered  the  extension  prior  to  Amendment  4  received 
open-label pasireotide. Data from both the blinded and open-label treatment were pooled in the analyses that 
included extension data for patients continuing on the same treatment. 
Study 2402 
The  patient,  Investigator,  site  staff,  monitor,  and  data  manager  were  unblinded  to  the  treatment  arm 
assignment but were blinded to the treatment dose in the double-blind pasireotide LAR treatment arm during 
the core phase. The extension phase of the study was unblinded.  
• 
Statistical methods 
Study C2305 
Interim analyses 
An early safety interim analysis was performed after 30 patients had completed the Month 6 assessment. These 
interim  data were analyzed by an independent  statistician and the results reviewed by the DMC in order to 
identify any early safety signal and make recommendations to Novartis. 
Analysis of the primary efficacy variable 
The analysis of the primary efficacy variable includes all data from the FAS. Last observation data at or after 
Month 6 were carried forward (last observation carried forward; LOCF) when a Month 12 assessment was not 
available. A patient who never received study drug was considered as a non-responder in the primary efficacy 
analysis. 
If a patient had less than three samples for the assessment of the 5-point mean GH from the 2- hour profile, 
then the mean GH was considered as missing. In addition, if GH and IGF-1 measurements were taken after 35 
days from the date of any injection of study drug, the values were considered as missing. Missing mean GH 
and/or IGF-1 were imputed using data obtained at or after Month 6 by the LOCF method, otherwise patients 
were considered as a non-responder. 
Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis 
The null hypothesis was that there is no difference in the response rate between pasireotide LAR and octreotide 
LAR. The alternative hypothesis was that the response rates are different between the two groups. A two-sided 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for randomization stratification factor was used to test the null 
hypothesis at the significance level of 0.05. 
In addition, the point estimate of odds ratio along with the two-sided 95% confidence interval was provided for 
each randomization stratum as well as overall. The response rate was also calculated with the two-sided 95% 
exact (Clopper-Pearson) confidence interval (CI) by randomization stratum and treatment group. 
Supportive/sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy variable 
The primary analysis was also performed on the PP set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 42/122 
  
  
As a sensitivity analysis to the primary efficacy endpoint on the FAS, a patient with missing GH or IGF-1 at Month 
12, or who had discontinued prior to Month 12, was considered a non-responder. 
In addition, following a GCP audit conducted by Novartis at 2 sites in Mexico (730 and 731), additional sensitivity 
analyses excluding the 22 patients from the two sites were conducted. These changes were made prior to the 
Month 26 database lock and unblinding of the study. 
Analysis of secondary and exploratory efficacy variables 
The 3 key secondary variables are the proportion of patients with GH <2.5μg/L, with normalization of IGF-1 and 
the change from baseline in tumour volume at Month 12. 
Study 2402 
Analysis of the primary variable 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the FAS. 
The statistical null hypotheses of the primary efficacy variable were: 
H1: The response rate in the pasireotide LAR 40 mg group was less than or equal to the active control group. 
H2: The response rate in the pasireotide LAR 60 mg group was less than or equal to the active control group. 
Each null hypothesis was tested against the one-sided alternative; that the response rate in the pasireotide LAR 
group was greater than in the active control group. 
An exact logistic regression model that adjusts for the randomization stratification factors (Hirji et al 1987) was 
used to test the null hypothesis. The exact two-sided 95% and 97.5% confidence intervals (CI) for the common 
odds ratio (OR) were calculated. A common OR >1 indicated an increased odds for the pasireotide LAR (40 mg 
or 60 mg) group compared to the active control group. 
The procedure to control the family-wise type I error rate at significance level α for the multiple comparisons on 
the  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy  variable  is  described  below  after  the  key  secondary  endpoints  are 
discussed. 
Handling of missing values 
If a patient had less than three samples for the assessment of the 5-point mean GH from the 2- hour profile, 
then the mean GH was considered as missing. In addition, if GH and IGF-1 measurements were taken after 35 
days from the date of any injection of study drug, the values were considered as missing. A patient with missing 
values  of  mean  GH  or  IGF-1  at  24  weeks  or  who  withdrew  earlier  from  the  study  was  considered  as  a 
non-responder. 
Analysis of secondary variables 
The  key  secondary  efficacy  variable  was  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  normalization  of  sex-  and 
age-adjusted IGF-1 at 24 weeks.

Conduct of the study 
Study C2305 
During the conduct of Study C2305, 2 sites were closed for critical GCP violations. To evaluate the potential 
impact of these violations on the outcome of the study, additional sensitivity analyses were conducted for 
efficacy and safety, in which the 22 patients from these sites were excluded. The results of these analyses are 
consistent with the main analyses, indicating that these GCP violations did not affect the validity of the study 
results. 
Protocol amendments 
The study protocol was amended 7 times. Previous sections describe the study conduct as amended. The key 
amendment is described below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 46/122 
  
  
 
 
 
Amendment 4 (23-Apr-2009) was implemented after 34 patients had entered the extension and introduced the 
following important changes: 
•  Patients randomized to octreotide, who responded to treatment at Month 12, were offered to enter a 
14-month extension phase with the same medication to have a benchmark for the evaluation of the 
long-term safety and efficacy of pasireotide. 
•  Patients not responding to either pasireotide or octreotide at Month 12 were to be offered to be switched 
to the other study medication in order to explore the safety and efficacy of switching from pasireotide to 
octreotide and from octreotide to pasireotide. Patients who crossed over to the other treatment arm at 
Month 13 were to follow the same schedule of evaluations as patients continuing in the extension phase 
in the same arm. 
•  Blinding to patients’ treatment was extended from Month 12 to Month 26. 
Protocol deviations 
Core phase 
Protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the PP set were reported for 15 patients (8.5%) in the pasireotide 
arm and 11 patients (6.0%) in the octreotide arm. The most common deviation was that patient did not 
complete 3 months of treatment (10 patients in the pasireotide arm and 8 patients in the octreotide arm). 
Deviations of inclusion criteria (all pertaining to GH assessment) were reported for 6 patients in the pasireotide 
arm and 4 patients in the octreotide arm, whereas exclusion criteria (prior medical treatment for acromegaly) 
was reported for 2 patients in the pasireotide arm. 
Extension 
Protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the second PP set were reported for 6 patients (7.4%) among those 
who crossed over to pasireotide, and 1 patient (2.6%) among those who crossed over to octreotide. The most 
common deviation was that patient did not complete 3 months of crossover treatment (4 patients on 
pasireotide, none on octreotide arm). 
Patients who received octreotide in the extension were not followed after Month 26 in the study, and were to 
receive their last injection at Month 25. There were 5 patients who were randomized to octreotide and who were 
recorded as receiving one or more injections of octreotide after this time point within the study. 
Ten patients crossed over in the extension with treatment switch not per protocol.  
Study 2402 
Protocol amendments 
The study protocol was amended 5 times. Previous sections describe the study conduct as amended. None of the 
amendments affected the analysis of the primary endpoint, thus the amendments are not considered to affect 
the outcome or the interpretation of the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014

Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the per-protocol set were reported for 11 patients (16.9%) in the 
pasireotide LAR 40 mg arm, 14 patients (21.5%) in the pasireotide LAR 60 mg arm, and 8 patients (11.8%) in 
the active control arm. Four patients had a protocol deviation of GH 5pt mean ≤ 2.5 µg/L or IGF-1 ≤ 1.3 × ULN. 
For one of these patients in the pasireotide LAR 60 mg arm, the protocol deviation was reported in error. The 
remaining three patients had screening GH or IGF-1 missing or below these criteria. At baseline, these patients 
had GH values above 2.5 μg/L and IGF-1 above 1.3 × ULN.

Similar to the FAS, baseline demographic characteristics in the cross-over analysis set (CAS) were balanced 
between the treatment arms. The mean age was 45.2 years, with equal proportions of men and women. The 
largest race groups were Caucasian (52.1%) and Asian (28.6%).

Baseline  characteristics  and  disease  history  were  balanced  between  the  treatment  arms.  Median  time  since 
diagnosis was six months, and the majority of patients (>80%) had been diagnosed within 24 months of study 
start. Less than half (42.2%) of all patients underwent prior surgery (40.3% in the pasireotide LAR arm and 
44.0% in the octreotide LAR arm). One patient had received radiation therapy 89.9 months (7.5 years) prior to 
study entry; this was recorded as a protocol deviation. 
Mean GH levels at core Baseline were 21.9 µg/L in the pasireotide LAR arm and 18.8 µg/L in the octreotide LAR 
arm. Mean standardized IGF-1 levels at core Baseline were 3.1 in both arms. 
For the crossover population, mean GH at extension Baseline was 5.9 µg/L for patients who crossed over to 
pasireotide LAR and 7.1 µg/L for patients who crossed over to octreotide LAR. Mean standardized IGF-1 level at 
extension Baseline was 1.9 for those who crossed over to pasireotide LAR and 2.1 for those who crossed over 
octreotide LAR. 
Medical  history  and  continuing  medical  conditions  were  as  expected  for  a  patient  population  with  active 
acromegaly of this age. 
Disease history and baseline characteristics for the crossover analysis set (CAS) were generally comparable with 
those of the FAS. The proportion of patients who had previous surgery was lower among patients who crossed 
over to octreotide LAR (26.3%) than in patients who crossed over to pasireotide (43.2%).

Outcomes and estimation 
Study C2305 
Primary efficacy results  
The study met its primary endpoint showing a statistically significant result (p=0.007) in favour of pasireotide 
LAR (Table 10). The proportion of responders (i.e. patients with GH below 2.5 µg/L and normalized IGF-1 at 
Month 12) was 31.3% (95% CI 24.5, 38.7) in the pasireotide LAR arm, and 19.2% (95% CI 13.8, 25.7) in the 
octreotide LAR arm, with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 1.942 (1.190, 3.168) in favour of pasireotide LAR. 
When analyzed by post-surgery vs de novo stratum, the response rates were slightly higher for patients who 
were post-surgery relative to de novo patients for both pasireotide LAR and for octreotide LAR, with response 
rates remaining higher in the pasireotide LAR arm than in the octreotide LAR arm for both strata (Table 10).  
GH and IGF-1 at Month 12 were imputed by carrying the last observation forward (LOCF) for four and three 
responders in the pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR arms, respectively. Analyses of response rates without 
imputation showed a response rate of 29% in the pasireotide group and 17.6% in the octreotide LAR group.

Supportive analysis for primary efficacy endpoint 
The results of the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint for the PP set (the subset of patients in the FAS who 
did not have any major protocol deviation by Month 12 and completed 80% of randomized treatment during the 
core study) were consistent with the primary efficacy analysis and show a treatment effect statistically 
significantly in favour of pasireotide LAR (33.5%) vs octreotide (19.9%) (p=0.004; odds ratio 2.056 with 95% 
CI (1.247, 3.389)). 
The results of the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint where patients with missing values were considered

significantly in favour of pasireotide LAR (29.0%) vs octreotide 17.6% (p=0.009; odds ratio 1.939 with 95% CI 
(1.173, 3.206)). This analysis was based on the FAS. 
Analysis of key secondary efficacy variables - Study C2305 core phase 
Patients with a GH response at Month 12 
The proportion of patients with reduction of GH to below 2.5 µg/L at Month 12 was comparable in both treatment 
arms,  with  48.3%  of  patients  in  the  pasireotide  LAR  arm  and  51.6%  of  patients  in  the  octreotide  LAR  arm 
achieving this response (Table 11). By post-surgery vs de novo strata, the response rates for post-surgery 
patients were 52.1% for pasireotide LAR and 51.3% for octreotide LAR; for de novo patients, the response rates 
were 45.7% for pasireotide LAR and 51.9% for octreotide LAR. 
The GH value at Month 12 was imputed for nine responders in the pasireotide LAR arm, and eight responders in 
the  octreotide  LAR  arm.  Response  rates  without  imputation  showed  43.2%  and  47.3%  of  patients  in  the 
pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR arms respectively, with GH levels below 2.5 µg/L at Month 12.

Patients with IGF-1 response at Month 12 
The proportion of patients with normalization of IGF-1 at Month 12 was significantly higher in the pasireotide 
LAR arm than in the octreotide LAR arm (Table 12). The proportion of patients with normalized IGF-1 was 
38.6% in the pasireotide LAR arm, and 23.6% in the octreotide LAR arm, with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.087 
(1.316, 3.308) in favour of pasireotide LAR (Simes test adjusted p=0.007).  
The proportion of patients with IGF-1 levels in the normal range or below the normal range (over-response) at 
Month 12 was 44.3% for pasireotide LAR and 25.8% for octreotide LAR. Ten patients in the pasireotide LAR arm 
and four patients in the octreotide LAR arm were not considered IGF-1 responders in the per-protocol analysis 
because their IGF-1 levels decreased to below the LLN. 
The IGF-1 at Month 12 was imputed for five responders in the pasireotide LAR arm and three responders in the 
octreotide LAR arm. Without imputation, response rates at Month 12 were 35.8% and 22.0% for pasireotide LAR 
and octreotide LAR, respectively.

Change from Baseline in tumour volume 
Baseline tumour volume was comparable in both treatment arms and between post-surgery and de novo strata 
(Table 13). 
A marked decrease in tumour volume was seen at Month 12 in both treatment arms . The mean decrease was 
987.1 mm3 (39.7%) in the pasireotide LAR arm, and 801.2 mm3 (38.0%) in the octreotide LAR arm. Similar 
decreases were observed with both treatments in both post-surgery and de novo strata. 
The proportion of patients with decrease or no change in tumour volume was high in both treatment arms,  
however it was slightly higher for pasireotide vs. octreotide, both for post-surgery patients (100% vs. 94.2%), 
and for de novo patients (96.1% vs. 94.4%).

Reduction in tumour volume of at least 20%: The proportion of patients who achieved a reduction of at least 
20%  in  tumour  volume  during  core  plus  extension  treatment  (up  to  crossover)  was  comparable  in  both 
treatment arms (74.7% for pasireotide LAR vs. 71.6% for octreotide LAR). The median time to this event was 
also comparable (25.0 weeks for pasireotide LAR vs. 24.3 weeks for octreotide LAR). The probability estimates 
for this event at 48 weeks was slightly higher for pasireotide LAR (21.8%) than for octreotide LAR (17.4%). The 
results were comparable across strata (post-surgery and de novo). 
Other secondary efficacy results – Study C2305 core phase 
Shifts from Baseline in GH during core phase 
Baseline GH categories (<1 µg/L, 1 to <2.5 µg/L, 2.5 to <5 µg/L, ≥ 5 µg/L) were comparable between the 
pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR arms, with more than 70% of all patients having baseline GH in the ≥ 5 µg/L 
category. Shifts to lower GH categories occurred on both treatments, but the proportion of patients with a shift 
was slightly higher in the pasireotide LAR arm than the octreotide LAR arm. Among patients with baseline GH ≥ 
5 µg/L, 84 of 125 patients (67.2%) in the pasireotide LAR arm shifted to a lower category, compared to 84 of 
134 patients (62.7%) in the octreotide LAR arm. 
Note also that the proportion of patients who had GH below 1 µg/L as last value in the core was marginally higher 
in  the  pasireotide  LAR  arm  (27.3%)  than  in  the  octreotide  LAR  arm  (23.6%);  conversely  the  proportion  of 
patients with GH ≥ 5 µg/L as last value was higher in the octreotide LAR arm (26.9%) than the pasireotide LAR 
arm (22.2%). 
Other efficacy results – core phase and up to crossover- Study C2305 
The sections below present analyses of data for the core phase (i.e. up to Month 12), and up to crossover (i.e. 
including  core  and  extension  data  up  to  data  cut-off  for  patients  who  continued  the  same  treatment  in  the 
extension). For patients who crossed over, data are included up to the time point of crossover (note that for 
analyses of response rates these patients are considered non-responders for time points after crossover). The 
evaluation of efficacy in the sections below focuses on assessments up to Month 25, as this was the last visit at 
which efficacy parameters were assessed in the octreotide arm. 
The time point for crossover was at Month 12 for patients who entered the extension prior to Amendment 4 
(n=31), and at Month 13 for patients who entered the extension after Amendment 4 (n=228). In addition, three 
patients who entered the extension prior to Amendment 4, and seven patients who entered the extension after 
Amendment 4, had their treatment changed at a later time point in the extension. 
Because the decision regarding a patient's treatment in the extension was at the discretion of the investigator, 
patients who did not meet the GH and IGF-1 response criteria at Month 12 could continue in the extension on the 
same treatment if the investigator felt that the patient benefited from the randomized treatment. The number

of patients who continued the same treatment in the extension was 74 (42.0%) for pasireotide and 46 (25.3%) 
for octreotide. Among these patients, the majority had full or partial response in terms of GH and IGF-1 at the 
Month 12 assessment. Thirteen of the 74 patients (17.6%) on pasireotide and 8 of the 46 patients (17.4%) on 
octreotide were non-responders at Month 12. 
Based on these results, the Applicant concluded that no bias was evident with respect to investigator's choice of 
treatment for the extension (i.e. randomized treatment vs. crossover) between the treatment arms. 
Patients with GH and IGF-1 response over time 
The  proportions  of  patients  who  were  responders  (i.e.  GH  below  2.5  µg/L  and  normalized  IGF-1)  were 
consistently higher in the pasireotide LAR arm than in the octreotide LAR arm throughout the core and extension 
for  patients  who  remained  on  the  same  treatment.  Odds  ratios  indicated  a  treatment  effect  in  favour  of 
pasireotide LAR at all time points up to Month 25. Results at Month 12 for this population are consistent with 
those of the primary efficacy analysis (Table 14). 
The results of analyses evaluating response rates in the blinded extension (Month 12 to Month 25), using as a 
denominator the number of patients who entered the extension and remained on the same treatment in the core 
(n=74 for pasireotide LAR, and n=46 for octreotide LAR) showed a persistent treatment effect in both arms. The 
response rates were comparable in both arms.

The proportion of responder was higher in the pasireotide LAR arm than the octreotide LAR arm throughout the 
core and extension. Note that the denominator changes over time: for time points up to Month 12 it is the FAS, 
for time points beyond Month 12 patients who did not enter the extension after completion of core were excluded 
(unless they crossed over or discontinued early). 
At Month 12, 29.0% of patients in the pasireotide arm achieved both, GH and IGF-1 response. GH response only 
was achieved by additional 14.2% and IGF-1 response only was achieved by additional 6.8% of patients in the 
pasireotide LAR arm. In the octreotide arm GH and IGF-1 response was achieved by 17.6% of patients, GH

response only was achieved by additional 29.7% and IGF-1 response only was achieved by additional 4.4% of 
patients.  
Patients with GH response over time 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  achieved  GH  below  2.5  µg/L  was  comparable  in  the  pasireotide  LAR  and 
octreotide LAR arms throughout the core up to Month 12 (Table 15). 
During the extension up to Month 25, the proportion of patients with a GH response was slightly higher in the 
pasireotide LAR arm than in the octreotide LAR arm. Odds ratios indicated a treatment effect in favour of 
pasireotide LAR at all visits in the extension; with lower bound of 95% CIs above 1 at all time points up to Month 
25.

The results of analyses evaluating GH response rates in the extension (Month 12 to Month 25) including only 
patients who entered the extension on the same treatment as in the core (74 patients in the pasireotide LAR arm 
and 46 patients in the octreotide LAR arm) showed that the response rates for GH were similar between the 
pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR arms from Month 12 to Month 25, and ranged between 66.2 to 78.4% for 
pasireotide and from 71.7% and 80.4% for octreotide.  
GH values over time 
As shown in Figure 3, by Month 3 a marked decrease in mean GH was observed in both arms (percent decrease 
from Baseline was 63.4% for pasireotide LAR and 61.4% for octreotide LAR), with a slight further decrease 
observed up to Month 12 for patients who remained in the study. Between-treatment comparison for change 
from Baseline did not reveal any statistically significant differences between the treatment arms up to Month 12. 
As expected, the mean GH levels of patients who continued the same treatment were below 2.5 µg/L at the first 
assessment in the extension (Month 16) in both treatment arms. 
The treatment effect was consistent across strata in both arms. Patients who were post-surgery had slightly 
lower baseline GH levels (mean 16.1 µg/L and 13.3 µg/L for pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR, respectively) 
than patients with a de novo tumour (mean 25.9 µg/L and 22.9 µg/L, respectively). Robust decreases in GH

levels were observed in both treatment arms for both strata by Month 3: percent decrease from Baseline was 
63.8% and 51.9% (pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR, respectively) for patients who were post-surgery, and 
63.1% and 68.1% for patients who were de novo. GH levels at Month 12 were slightly lower for patients who 
were post-surgery (2.6 µg/L and 3.3 µg/L for pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR, respectively) than for patients 
who were de novo (5.8 µg/L and 5.3 µg/L). A slight difference between the strata was also evident at Month 25; 
mean GH values for post-surgery patients were 1.3 µg/L and 1.0 µg/L for pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR, 
whereas for de novo patients mean GH values were 2.9 µg/L and 1.4 µg/L, respectively.

GH was based on mean of a 5-point 2-hour profile. 
Patients with IGF-1 response over time 
The proportion of patients who achieved normalization of IGF-1 was higher in the pasireotide LAR than the 
octreotide LAR arm throughout the core and extension (Table 16). 
Odds ratios indicated a treatment effect in favour of pasireotide LAR at all visits in the core and extension, with 
lower bound of 95% CIs above 1 at all time points except Month 9 and Month 22.

Mean standardized IGF-1 values over time 
Baseline mean standardized IGF-1 was comparable in the pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR arms (mean 3.1 
in both arms). Standardized IGF-1 values were calculated by dividing the actual IGF-1 value by the ULN of the 
normal range reported by local laboratory providing the patient data. By Month 3, there was a marked reduction 
in IGF-1 levels in both treatment arms (mean percent decrease from Baseline was 49.5% for pasireotide LAR 
and 45.1% for octreotide LAR). At Month 12, mean IGF-1 was 1.4 in the pasireotide LAR arm, and 1.5 in the 
octreotide LAR arm. The decrease from Baseline at Month 12 was slightly larger in the pasireotide LAR arm 
(55.2%) than the octreotide LAR arm (45.4%). 
As expected, standardized IGF-1 levels were close to 1 (actual IGF-1 value/local lab ULN) at the first assessment 
in the extension (Month 16) in both treatment arms, and remained stable thereafter in both treatment arms. At 
Month 25, mean IGF-1 was 0.8 vs. 0.9 for pasireotide LAR vs. octreotide LAR, and the mean decrease from 
Baseline was 67.2% vs. 61.2%, respectively. 
The treatment effect was consistent across strata in both arms. Patients who were post-surgery had slightly 
lower baseline IGF-1 levels (mean 2.6 and 2.8 for pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR, respectively) than de 
novo patients (mean 3.3 in both arms). There were robust decreases in IGF-1 levels in both treatment arms for 
both strata by Month 3 in the core: mean percent decrease from Baseline was 54.9% vs. 40.0% (pasireotide LAR 
vs. octreotide LAR) for patients who were post-surgery, and 46.0% vs. 48.8% for de novo patients. Mean IGF-1 
levels at Month 12 were slightly lower for patients who were post-surgery (1.0 vs. 1.5 for pasireotide LAR vs. 
octreotide LAR) than for de novo patients (1.6 in both arms). A slight difference between the strata was also 
evident at Month 25; mean IGF-1 for post-surgery patients was 0.7 for both pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR, 
whereas for de novo patients mean IGF-1 was 0.9 vs. 1.0 for pasireotide LAR vs. octreotide LAR. 
Time to first response and persistence of efficacy 
Time to first response 
Median time to first response in terms of combined GH and IGF-1 criteria (i.e. GH below 2.5 µg/L and normalized 
IGF-1) during core and extension treatment (up to crossover) was comparable in the two treatment arms: 12.6 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 58/122 
  
  
 
weeks for pasireotide, and 12.4 weeks for octreotide LAR. The results were similar for both strata (post-surgery 
and de novo). 
Time to first GH response (i.e. GH below 2.5 µg/L) and time to first IGF-1 response (i.e. normalization of IGF-1) 
were also similar in both treatment arms and strata. 
Duration of first response 
The median duration of first response for patients who achieved response was twice as long in the pasireotide 
arm (51.6 weeks, 95% CI 24.1, 64.1) than in the octreotide LAR arm (24.1 weeks, 95% CI 12.3, 36.0). Patients 
who lost response at one visit in both treatment arms often regained response at later visits. 
The number of patients with a response based on GH and IGF-1 criteria (i.e. GH below 2.5 µg/L and normalized 
IGF-1 at any time point) using up to crossover data was higher in the pasireotide arm (81 patients) than in the 
octreotide LAR arm (63 patients). By data cut-off (or crossover for patients who crossed over), 30 patients in 
pasireotide  LAR  arm  and  12  in  octreotide  LAR  arm  maintained  response  at  all  subsequent  time  points.  The 
remaining 51 patients in the pasireotide LAR and 48 patients in the octreotide LAR lost response at least once. 
The  abnormal  values  for  these  patients  were  very  close  to  the  normal  limits  and  returned  to  normal  at 
subsequent evaluations. Additionally, some patients were recorded to have lost response due to IGF-1 values 
below LLN. The loss of response was defined as GH ≥ 2.5 µg/L and/or any IGF-1 above or below normal. At 
Month 12, 4.5% of patients in the pasireotide arm and 1.6% of patients in the octreotide arm had over response 
defined as GH below 2.5 µg/L and IGF-1 below LLN. 
Duration of response achieved at Month 12 
The number of patients who achieved a response at Month 12 (i.e. GH to below2.5 µg/L and normalized IGF-1) 
was 51 in the pasireotide arm, and 32 in the octreotide LAR arm. The response was maintained for 64.4 weeks 
for pasireotide, and 64.6 weeks for octreotide LAR and was comparable in the two treatment arms (Table 17). 
About half of all patients with response were censored for this analysis. 
Based on review of individual patient data, most patients who lost response after Month 12 did so due to small 
variations in GH and IGF-1 levels (of note, some patients lost response because their IGF-1 decreased to below 
LLN). In both arms, the GH and  IGF-1 levels tended to remain close to the criteria for biochemical control: 
tachyphylaxis was not evident.

Tumour volume 
Tumour volume data collected beyond Month 12 showed that mean tumour volume continued to decrease for 
patients who continued the same  treatment in  the extension. Mean percent decrease from  core Baseline at 
Month 25 was 51.8% (n=54) for pasireotide and 55.0% (n=34) for octreotide. As mentioned previously, the 
mean percentage decrease at Month 12 was 39.7% for pasireotide and 38.0% for octreotide. Most of the data 
after Month 25 is from patients receiving pasireotide, who remained on study longer. For these patients, tumour 
volume continued to decrease. 
Change from Baseline in PRL levels 
Mean baseline PRL levels were higher in in the pasireotide LAR arm (20.6 µg/L) than the octreotide LAR arm 
(15.8  µg/L),  but  median  values  were  similar  (median  8.0  µg/L  in  both  arms).  PRL  levels  decreased  with 
treatment in both arms, but did so more rapidly in the pasireotide LAR arm than in the octreotide LAR arm. At 
Month 12, mean PRL was 8.9 µg/L in the pasireotide LAR arm and 11.7 µg/L in the octreotide LAR arm, and 
median PRL was the same (6.0 µg/L) in both arms. 
There was a statistically significant difference (p=0.006) between the two treatment arms in change in PRL from 
Baseline to Month 12. 
Mean  and  median  PRL  levels  decreased  further  during  the  extension  for  patients  who  continued  the  same 
treatment, with levels decreasing further in the pasireotide LAR than the octreotide LAR arm. At Month 25, mean 
PRL was 5.4 µg/L in the pasireotide LAR arm and 6.7 µg/L in the octreotide LAR arm; the mean decrease from 
Baseline was 31.1% vs. 25.9% for pasireotide LAR vs. octreotide LAR. 
In addition, changes in PRL levels were analyzed for those patients with hyperprolactemia (PRL level above the 
upper limit of normal) at study entry. Mean baseline values were higher in the 29 patients in the pasireotide LAR 
arm (83.5 µg/L) than for the 30 patients in the octreotide LAR arm (55.9 µg/L). Over time the decrease in PRL 
levels  was  greater  in  the  pasireotide  LAR  arm  compared  to  the  octreotide  LAR  arm.  At  Month  12,  median 
decrease was −31.5 µg/L, with an actual median value of 11.0 µg/L in the pasireotide LAR arm and −25.5 µg/L, 
with  an  actual  median  value  of  25.0  µg/L  in  the  octreotide  LAR  arm.  This  trend  remained  for  patients  who 
continued on the same treatment; at Month 25, the median decrease was −27.0 µg/L, with an actual median 
value of 5.0 µg/L in the pasireotide LAR arm and -30.0 µg/L, with an actual median value of 12.5 µg/L in the 
octreotide LAR arm. 
Symptoms of acromegaly and ring size 
Symptoms  of  acromegaly  (headache,  fatigue,  perspiration,  paresthesias,  osteoarthralgia)  were  recorded 
monthly  in  the  core  phase  and  in  the  first  6  months  in  the  extension  and  every  three  months  thereafter 
according  to  a  five-point  score  scale  (0=absent,  1=mild,  2=moderate,  3=severe,  4=very  severe). 
Improvements in severity scores of acromegaly symptoms were noted in both treatment arms at Month 12. No 
relevant differences were observed between the treatment arms in the core phase and for those who continued 
on the same treatment. 
Ring size was measured at the fourth digit of the non-dominant hand. In the case a patient had a fourth digit size 
exceeding the highest size of the measuring device, the fifth digit of that hand was used for initial and follow-up 
investigation. Assessments were recorded at the same time-points as signs and symptoms of the disease. A 
small  decrease  in  mean  ring  size  was  observed  in  both  treatment  arms  at  Month  12,  however,  differences 
between treatment arms were not statistically significant (p=0.219). Mean ring size remained below baseline 
levels throughout the extension for patients who continued the same treatment.

Acromegaly quality of life 
Improvements in AcroQoL scores (total and individual sub-scores) were noted in both treatment arms, but the 
changes from Baseline were larger in the pasireotide LAR arm than the octreotide LAR arm throughout the study 
period.  At  Month  12,  the  mean  percentage  increase  from  Baseline  in  total  AcroQoL  score  was  +28.4%  for 
pasireotide LAR and +15.8% for octreotide LAR. AcroQoL scores remained higher in the pasireotide LAR than the 
octreotide LAR arm throughout the extension for patients who continued the same treatment; at Month 25, the 
change from Baseline was +41.4% for pasireotide LAR and +12.1% for octreotide LAR. 
The results for between-treatment comparison for change from Baseline in AcroQoL at Month 12 showed that 
the changes from Baseline were numerically higher in the pasireotide LAR arm than in the octreotide LAR arm for 
the total score (least square mean change of 7.2 for pasireotide LAR vs. 4.8 for octreotide LAR) as well as the 
four sub-scores. The difference between pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR was not statistically significant for 
the total score (p=0.158) or for any of the sub-scores (p-values ranged from 0.072 to 0.405). However, it must 
be noted that the study was not powered to detect a significant difference in this analysis. 
Study C2402 
Primary efficacy results for Study C2402 
Study C2402 met its primary efficacy endpoint. In both the pasireotide LAR 40 mg and 60 mg treatment arms, 
the proportion of patients who achieved biochemical control was significantly higher compared to the active 
control arm (Table 18).  
In the pasireotide LAR 40 mg arm, 10 patients (15.4%) achieved biochemical control at Week 24 compared with 
none in the active control arm (odds ratio=16.63 with 95% CI: [3.32, infinity]; adjusted p-value=0.0006).  
In the pasireotide LAR 60 mg arm, 13 patients (20.0%) achieved biochemical control at 24 weeks (odds 
ratio=23.03 with 95% CI: [4.72, infinity]; adjusted p-value<0.0001).

Supportive analysis for primary efficacy endpoint 
The proportion of patients who achieved biochemical control at Week 24 in the PP set (i.e. patients with no 
protocol deviations) was similar to that observed in the FAS; in the PP set, seven patients (13%) in the 40 mg 
arm,  nine  patients  (18.0%)  in  the  60  mg  arm,  and  no  patients  (0%)  in  the  active  control  arm  achieved 
biochemical control at Week 24. The difference from the rate in the active control arm was statistically significant 
in both the 40 mg (p=0.0051) and 60 mg (p=0.0007) treatment arms. 
The results of a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint using LOCF were in line with those of the primary 
analysis (Table 19).

Response rates by randomization strata 
Both  pasireotide  arms  were  superior  to  active  control  in  patients  previously  inadequately  controlled  on 
octreotide.  Among  patients  in  the  stratum  prior  octreotide  LAR,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  achieved 
biochemical control at Week 24 was consistent with the primary analysis. For the stratum prior lanreotide, low 
sample size prevents any definite conclusions from being drawn. 
Both pasireotide arms were superior to active control in patients with a baseline GH level below 10 µg/L. Among 
patients with a baseline GH level below 10 µg/L, the proportion of patients who achieved biochemical control at 
Week 24 was consistent with the primary analysis. No meaningful conclusions can be drawn for patients with a 
baseline GH level above 10 µg/L due to the low sample size.  
Analysis of the key secondary efficacy variable – Study C2402 
The proportion of patients who achieved normalization of IGF-1 at Week 24 (key secondary efficacy variable) 
was significantly higher in both pasireotide arms (24.6% and 26.2% in the pasireotide LAR 40 mg and 60 mg 
arms, respectively) compared to the active control arm (no responders) (Table 20). 
The response rates in terms of IGF-1 normalization at Week 12 (24.6% in each pasireotide LAR arm, and 1.5% 
in the active control arm) were similar to those at Week 24.

Analysis of other secondary efficacy variables – Study C2402 
Patients with GH response 
The proportion of patients with mean GH below 2.5 ug/L at Week 24 was highest in the pasireotide LAR 60 mg 
arm (43.1%), followed by the 40 mg arm (35.4%) and the active control arm (13.2%) (Table 21). 
The results for GH response at Week 12 were similar to those at Week 24, with 33.8%, 49.2% and 4.4% of 
patients in the pasireotide LAR 40 mg, 60 mg and active control arms achieving GH below 2.5 µg/L at Week 12, 
respectively.  
The proportion of patients with a reduction of GH to below 1 µg/L at Week 24 was also highest in the pasireotide 
LAR  60 mg  arm  (18.5%),  followed  by  the  pasireotide  LAR  40 mg  arm  (12.3%),  and  the  active  control  arm 
(2.9%). Similar results were seen at Week 12, with 7.7%, 21.5% and 1.5% of patients in the pasireotide LAR 
40 mg, 60 mg and active control arm achieving GH below 1 µg/L at Week 12, respectively.

Change from Baseline in GH at Week 24 
Both doses of pasireotide LAR were more efficacious than active control in suppressing GH levels; suppression 
of mean GH was achieved by Week 12 and was well maintained thereafter (Figure 4).  
Most patients entered the study with a median GH level below 10 µg/L. The median absolute change in GH from 
Baseline to Week 24 was −3.10 µg/L and −2.88 µg/L in the pasireotide LAR 40 mg and 60 mg arms, and −0.88 
µg/L in the active control arm.  
Mean percentage change from Baseline in mean GH at Week 24 was −23.10% and −50.86% in the pasireotide 
LAR 40 mg and 60 mg arms, and −3.16% in the active control arm. The least square mean difference from the 
active control arm was−6.26 in the 40 mg arm and −13.75 in the 60 mg arm.  One patient [C2402-0223-00002] 
in the active control arm had very high post-baseline GH value, which heavily influenced the mean GH over time 
in Figure 4. This patient had a GH value of 92.38 µg/L at Baseline, which increased to 573.18 µg/L at Week 12, 
and then decreased slightly to 527.86 µg/L at Week 24. 
Most patients had a decrease in their GH levels on pasireotide LAR treatment.

Change from Baseline in IGF-1 at Week 24 
Both doses of pasireotide LAR were more efficacious than active control in suppressing IGF-1 levels; suppression 
of mean IGF-1 was achieved by Week 12 and was well maintained afterwards (Figure 5).  
Mean IGF-1 level at Baseline was similar among the three treatment arms, with a mean standardized IGF-1 level 
of between 2.5 and 3 in each arm at Baseline. The mean absolute change in IGF-1 from Baseline to Week 24 was 
−0.650 and −1.116 for pasireotide LAR 40 mg and 60 mg, and −0.327 for active control.  
Mean percentage change from Baseline in mean IGF-1 level at Week 24 was −28.0% and −38.6% in the 
pasireotide LAR 40 mg and 60 mg arms, and −7.2% in the active control arm.

Change in tumour volume 
The proportion of patients in the FAS with greater than 25% reduction in tumour volume at Week 24 was 18.5% 
for pasireotide LAR 40 mg arm, 10.8% for pasireotide LAR 60 mg, and 1.5% for active control.  
Approximately 58% of all patients had a tumour assessment performed within the protocol-specified window of 
±35 days. Among these patients the mean percentage change in tumour volume from Baseline to Week 24 was 
greater in the pasireotide arms (−14.38% and −9.45% for 40 mg and 60 mg) than the active control arm 
(−2.04%). 
As shown in Figure 6, the majority (70 to 80%) of patients with tumour volume assessment in the pasireotide 
LAR arms had tumour shrinkage or no change in tumour volume. In the active control arm, 50% of patients had 
shrinkage or no change; the remainder had an increase in tumour volume. Greater than 25% reduction in 
tumour volume was seen for 28.6% and 18.9% of patients in the pasireotide LAR 40 mg and 60 mg arms, and 
2.8% of patients in the active control arm.

Symptoms of acromegaly 
At Baseline, approximately half of all patients had no or mild symptoms of acromegaly (headache, fatigue, 
perspiration, osteoarthralgia, and paresthesiae), and the proportions were comparable between the treatment 
arms. Mean scores were slightly decreased for all symptoms at Week 24 in all treatment arms. There was little 
change in ring size in both pasireotide LAR arms and in the active control arm.  
Acromegaly quality of life 
At Baseline, mean AcroQoL scores were comparable between the three treatment arms (59.9 in the pasireotide 
LAR 40 mg arm, 57.2 in the pasireotide LAR 60 mg arm, and 55.5 in the active control arm. At Week 24, mean 
AcroQoL scores were 61.0, 61.9 and 56.2 in the respective treatment arms. 
Interim efficacy results for the extension phase of Study C2402 
Twenty-nine patients (17%) had not reached the Week 28 time point (8 patients in the pasireotide LAR 40 mg 
arm, 9 patients in the pasireotide LAR 60 mg arm, and 12 patients in the cross-over arm) and were ongoing in 
the study at the cut-off date. 
At Week 28 of the extension phase, the proportion of patients with biochemical control was 22.5% (9 patients) 
in the pasireotide LAR 40 mg arm and 41.7% (15 patients) in the pasireotide LAR 60 mg arm. Among the 
patients who crossed-over to pasireotide, 10 (21.3%) patients had biochemical control at Week 28, consistent 
with the results of the primary analysis in the core phase (Table 22).

Efficacy results – Study C2305 extension after crossover (inadequately controlled patients) 
Patients with GH and IGF-1 response 
A higher proportion of patients who crossed over to pasireotide LAR met the GH and IGF-1 response criteria (i.e. 
GH below 2.5 µg/L and normalized IGF-1), compared to those who crossed over to octreotide LAR. For patients 
who crossed to pasireotide LAR, the response rate at Month 12 after crossover was 17.3% (14 out of 81 
patients); in contrast, none of the 38 patients who crossed over to octreotide LAR met the response criteria at 
Month 12 (Table 23). The results for the Second PP set were consistent with those of the CAS. 
Response rates for patients who crossed to pasireotide LAR were stable for up to two years after crossover, with 
response rates ranging from 17.8% to 19.4% for Month 15 through Month 24 after crossover.

GH response (regardless of IGF-1 response) was achieved at Month 12 by 27.2 % of patients who crossed over 
to pasireotide LAR and 23.7% of patients who crossed over to octreotide LAR. IGF-1 response (regardless of GH 
response) was achieved at Month 12 by 9.9% of patients who crossed over to pasireotide LAR and 5.3% of 
patients who crossed over to octreotide LAR.  
Response categories (FR, PR, NR) after crossover 
At extension Baseline, the proportion of patients who were non-responders was similar in both crossover arms 
(74.1% for crossover to pasireotide LAR, and 78.4% for crossover to octreotide LAR). One of the 81 patients 
who crossed to pasireotide LAR was a responder and 20 of the 81 (24.7%) had PR, while eight of 37 patients 
(21.6%) who crossed to octreotide LAR had PR. 
For patients who crossed over to pasireotide LAR, the proportion of patients with FR was 26.0% at Month 3, and 
increased to 32.4% at Month 6; and to 36.2% at Month 12. The proportion of patients with PR was 26.0% at 
Month 3, and remained relatively constant at subsequent time points. At Month 12, the proportion of patients 
with FR or PR was 67.2%. 
In contrast, few patients who crossed over to octreotide LAR achieved FR or PR; at Month 3, one patient (2.7%) 
had FR, and three patients (8.1%) had PR. Similar values were reported at Month 6. At Month 12, no patient had 
FR, and four patients (13.3%) had PR.  
The proportion of non-responders after crossover to octreotide LAR was high (between 81.8% and 89.2%), 
whereas after crossover to pasireotide LAR the proportion of non-responders decreased from 47.9% at Month 3 
to 32.8% at Month 12. 
Over-response was reported only for patients who crossed over to pasireotide LAR. The proportion of patients 
with over-response varied between 6.8% and 13.1% over the time after the crossover. 
Patients with GH response 
The response rates for reduction in GH to below 2.5 µg/L were higher for patients who crossed over to 
pasireotide LAR (43.2% and 44.4% at Months 6 and 12, respectively), compared to those who crossed over to 
octreotide LAR (31.6% and 23.7% at Month 6 and Month 12, respectively (Table 24). At extension Baseline, 
two patients who crossed over to pasireotide LAR had a GH response, whereas no patients who crossed over to 
octreotide LAR had a GH response. 
The results for the Second PP set were consistent with those of the CAS.

While response rates with respect to GH levels, for patients who crossed to pasireotide LAR were stable for the 
first year after crossover, the proportion of responders decreased over the next year; at Month 24 after 
crossover, the response rate was 20.4%. However, review of the individual patient data showed that GH levels 
did not show a large variation over time. 
GH values over time 
As shown in Figure 7, mean GH decreased for patients who crossed over to pasireotide LAR, whereas mean GH 
increased among those who crossed over to octreotide LAR. Mean GH at extension Baseline was slightly lower 
for patients who crossed over to pasireotide LAR (5.9 µg/L, n=78) than for those who crossed over to octreotide 
LAR (7.1 µg/L, n=33). After crossover to pasireotide LAR, mean GH decreased to 4.8 µg/L at Month 6 (mean 
decrease from Baseline 5.9%) and to 2.5 µg/L at Month 12 (mean decrease 23.7%); GH levels remained below 
2.5 µg/L at all subsequent visits. After crossover to octreotide LAR, mean GH increased to 9.8 µg/L at Month 6 
(mean increase 56.4%) and to 10.4 µg/L at Month 12 (mean increase 74.5%).

Shifts in GH categories from extension Baseline to Month 26 for patients who crossed over 
Among patients who crossed over (81 to pasireotide and 38 to octreotide), more than 70% had at extension 
Baseline a GH that was in the >5 µg/L category. Among these patients 49 of 62 patients (79.0%) on pasireotide 
LAR and 18 of 30 patients (60.0%) on octreotide LAR shifted to a lower GH category as last value. 
Among patients who crossed over to pasireotide LAR, the proportion who achieved GH below 2.5 µg/L was 
59.3%, compared to only 31.6% on octreotide LAR. Furthermore, 35.8% of patients who crossed to pasireotide 
LAR achieved a GH below 1 µg/L, compared to only 5.3% on octreotide LAR. 
GH nadir after OGTT 
After crossover, GH nadir values after OGTT improved in both treatments arms. After crossover to pasireotide 
LAR, mean GH nadir improved from 4.0 µg/L (n=28) at extension Baseline to 2.2 µg/L at Month 6 (n=21) and 
to 2.1 µg/L at Month 12 (n=15). After crossover to octreotide LAR, mean GH nadir improved from 16.1 µg/L 
(n=4) at extension Baseline to 8.2 µg/L (n=4) at Month 6 and to 4.2 µg/L (n=3) at Month 12. The number of 
patients with data among those who crossed over to octreotide LAR was low, precluding a meaningful 
comparison between the treatments. 
Patients with IGF-1 response 
The response rates for normalization of IGF-1 were much higher for patients who crossed over to pasireotide 
LAR (30.9% and 27.2% at Months 6 and 12, respectively), compared to those who crossed over to octreotide 
LAR (7.9% and 5.3% at Months 6 and 12, respectively; Table 25). 
The proportion of patients with IGF-1 over-response (i.e. IGF-1 below LLN) at Months 6 and 12 after crossover 
were 39.5% and 38.3% for pasireotide LAR, and 7.9% and 5.3% for octreotide LAR, respectively. 
Response rates for patients who crossed to pasireotide LAR were stable for up to 2 years after crossover, with 
response rates ranging from 20.4% to 25.8% at Month 15 through Month 24 after crossover.

Standardized IGF-1 values over time 
As shown in Figure 8, mean standardized IGF-1 decreased for patients who crossed over to pasireotide LAR, but 
not for those who crossed over to octreotide. Mean IGF-1 at extension Baseline was to some extent lower for 
patients who crossed over to pasireotide LAR (1.9, n=78) than for those who crossed over to octreotide LAR 
(2.1, n=34). After crossover to pasireotide LAR mean IGF-1 decreased to 1.3 at Month 6 (mean decrease 
28.6%) and to 1.1 at Month 12 (mean decrease 39.9%); after Month 12, mean IGF-1 remained ≤ 1 at all 
subsequent visits. After crossover to octreotide LAR, mean IGF-1 remained nearly unchanged compared to

The numbers xx/xx below the x-axis represents the numbers of patients in pasireotide LAR/octreotide LAR treatment group. 
This analysis includes scheduled visits only. 
Change in tumour volume 
The mean decrease in tumour volume from extension Baseline was slightly higher in patients who crossed over 
to pasireotide LAR than in patients who crossed over to octreotide LAR (Table 26). At Month 12, the mean 
decrease in tumour volume was 24.7% for crossover to pasireotide LAR and 17.9% for crossover to octreotide 
LAR. The proportion of patients with a decrease or no change in tumour volume at Month 12 after crossover was 
higher for pasireotide LAR (91.3%) compared to octreotide LAR (73.1%). 
Available data after Month 12 for patients who crossed over to pasireotide LAR, show that tumour volume 
continued to decrease for these patients. At Month 24 after crossover, the mean decrease in tumour volume was 
35.8% for patients with data (n=9), and at Month 30, the mean decrease in tumour volume was 50.6% (n=6).

PRL values over time 
PRL  values  improved  over  time  for  patients  who  crossed  over  to  pasireotide  LAR,  but  not  for  patients  who 
crossed over to octreotide. After crossover to pasireotide LAR, mean PRL decreased from 11.9 µg/L at extension 
Baseline to 9.9 µg/L (mean percentage decrease 23.2%) at Month 6 and to 7.5 µg/L (mean percentage decrease 
21.7%) at Month 12. Mean PRL values remained below extension baseline levels at all subsequent visits. 
After crossover to octreotide, mean PRL decreased from 15.7 µg/L at extension Baseline to 13.6 µg/L at Month 
6 (mean percentage increase 1.4%) and increased to 16.1 µg/L (mean percentage increase 13.7%) at Month 
12. 
Symptoms of acromegaly and ring size 
At extension Baseline, severity scores for acromegaly symptoms were comparable between the treatment arms. 
After crossover, slight improvements compared to extension Baseline in mean severity scores were seen for 
patients who crossed to pasireotide LAR. 
Summary  statistics  for  decrease  in  ring  size  showed  improvements  for  both  crossover  treatments,  with  no 
relevant difference between the arms. 
Acromegaly quality of life 
Mean AcroQoL total and sub-scores were comparable at extension Baseline in both crossover arms. AcroQoL 
scores remained stable (total and individual sub-scores) in both crossover arms. 
Study C2305 subpopulations 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary efficacy endpoint by demographic factors of race, ethnicity 
and age group (<65, ≥ 65 years) using the FAS if the number of patients in the subgroup was large enough. In 
addition, the primary efficacy endpoint (using LOCF) was summarized by dose up-titration status and treatment. 
The results of the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint across demographic subgroups (race, ethnicity, age) 
show  a  treatment  effect  consistently  in  favour  of  pasireotide  LAR.  No  clinically  relevant  differences  were 
observed between subgroups with regard to age, race and ethnicity. Due to the low number of patients in some 
subgroups these results should be interpreted with caution. 
Study C2402  
Subpopulations 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary efficacy endpoint by the demographic factors, age (<65, 
≥ 65 years), ethnicity and race. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 72/122 
  
  
 
 
 
No meaningful conclusions can be drawn for subgroups of age and race due to the small number of patients ≥ 65 
years (<10% of all patients) and non-Caucasians (<20%). No effect of ethnicity on response rates was evident.

Primary Analysis 
It was performed on the full analysis set (FAS) at month 12.  The proportion of patients with GH 
< 2.5 µg/L at month 12 and patients with normalization of IGF-1 at month 12 were analyzed 
using CMH test adjusting for randomization stratification factor. The analyses were based on the 
principle of LOCF using the rule of handling missing values. 
Change of tumor volume at Month 12 from baseline was compared between the two treatment 
groups using ANCOVA model with treatment as the fixed effect and tumor volume at baseline 
and randomization stratum as covariates.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in special populations were conducted. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
Due to the underlying difference in study design between the studies, no pooling of data was performed for 
sub-group analysis. The subgroup analyses were performed for the primary efficacy endpoint by age group, race 
and ethnicity using the FAS and by dose up titration status and treatment for Study C2305, and by age group, 
race and ethnicity for Study C2402. No such analyses were performed for Study C2110/E1 or Study B2201/E3; 
due to the relatively small number of patients, such analyses were expected to yield inconclusive results of 
limited value. 
Supportive studies 
Supportive studies with LAR formulation - Study C2110 and C2110E1 
Study C2110 was an open-label, randomized study assessing PK, safety, and tolerability profiles of 20, 40, and 
60 mg doses of pasireotide LAR in patients with acromegaly or carcinoid disease. Following the completion of the 
core study patients were eligible to enter the extension Study C2110E1. 
Thirty-five (35) patients with acromegaly and 42 patients with carcinoid received pasireotide LAR treatment. 
Only data from patients with acromegaly are included in this regulatory submission. After completion of the 
three-month core phase, 29 patients with acromegaly entered the open-ended extension study C2110E1. 
The primary objectives of C2110 and the extension were related to PK and safety/tolerability. Clinical response 
was  measured  by  quantitative  assessment  of  PD  markers  (including  GH  and  IGF-1)  and  symptoms  of 
acromegaly. 
The results from this study showed that pasireotide LAR suppressed GH and IGF-1 concentrations (Figure 9 and 
Figure  10)  as  well  as  PRL  in  patients  with  acromegaly.  For  all  three  dose  groups,  the  reduction  effects  of 
pasireotide LAR on GH levels achieved plateau (steady state) immediately after LAR injection, and were well 
maintained afterwards; the reduction effects of pasireotide LAR on IGF-1 and free IGF-1 achieved steady state 
within four weeks, and were well maintained afterwards. Mean GH, IGF-1 and PRL concentrations decreased in 
all dose groups following the first pasireotide LAR injection. At the end of core phase (Month 3), mean decrease 
from Baseline in GH was -66.8%, -59.7% and -63.2%, in IGF-1 was-40.2%, -50.7% and -49.8%, and in PRL 
was -36.0%, -23.8% and -24.4%, for the 20, 40 and 60 mg dose groups, respectively.

Figure 10 Mean (+/- SE) of GH level by week and treatment in acromegaly patients (PD 
population) – Study C2110 
There were no statistically significant dose effects based on the results of the models fit in terms of the 
pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints (GH, IGF-1 and free IGF-1), which may be explained by the small sample size 
at each dose. Decreases in GH, total IGF-1, free IGF-1, and PRL concentrations were sustained up to Month 48 
for those patients who remained on treatment. By Month 36, 12 of the 20 (60%) of patients were considered 
responders (GH ≤ 2.5 µg/L and IGF-1within normal limits). 
Symptoms of acromegaly (headache, fatigue, perspiration, osteoarthralgia, and paresthesia) were present at 
Baseline for the majority of patients; improvements were seen in all 3 dose groups in both the core and 
extension phase.

Study B2201/E 
Assessment report

Page 78/122 
  
  
 
 
Study B2201 was an open-label, randomized, crossover study in patients with acromegaly receiving multiple 
doses of pasireotide sc and octreotide sc to assess efficacy (biochemical response, tumour volume, symptoms of 
acromegaly), safety, and PK/PD relationship. After completion of the 16-week core treatment period, patients 
were allowed to enroll into the extension. 
The primary objective of Study B2201 was to assess the effect of a four-week regimen of 100 g of octreotide 
sc three times daily followed by a four-week regimen of 200 g, 400 g, and 600 g of pasireotide sc twice daily 
on circulating GH and IGF-1 concentrations in patients with active acromegaly. All patients received each dose 
of pasireotide in a different sequence (6 sequences in total); a different dose was administered during each of 
the 3 treatment periods. In the extension study, patients continued at the lowest dose of pasireotide at which 
they achieved GH ≤2.5 g/L and normalization of IGF-1 levels (age and sex related). 
In Study B2201 primary efficacy results demonstrated that biochemical markers of the disease improved after 
28 days of pasireotide treatment (GH ≤ 2.5 µg/L and normalization of IGF-1). After initial treatment with 28 
days  of  octreotide  sc  biochemical  control  was  low  (8.6%).  Following  28  days  of  pasireotide  treatment 
biochemical  control  increased  to  19.0%  (combined  results  of  3  pasireotide  dose  groups)  with  the  highest 
response  rate  observed  with  the  600  µg  bid  dose.  At  Month  9  (extension  study)  biochemical  control  was 
achieved in 23.1%. Symptoms of acromegaly (headache, perspiration, paresthesia, fatigue, osteoarthralgia, 
and carpal tunnel syndrome) improved during both the core and extension study. Results demonstrated that 
from  core  Baseline  to  measurements  during  the  core  and  extension  there  was  an  overall  increase  in  the 
proportion of patients who report symptoms with a score of 0 or 1. 
Study B2103 
The proof-of-concept study B2103 was a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in patients with acromegaly 
to assess efficacy of single-dose pasireotide sc vs. octreotide sc. 
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy on circulating GH concentrations of single doses of 100 µg and 
250  µg  of  pasireotide  compared  to  that  of  a  single  dose  of  100  µg  of  octreotide  sc  in  patients  with  active 
acromegaly.  Results  showed  that  pasireotide  suppresses  GH  secretion  in  patients  with  acromegaly,  thus 
demonstrating a successful proof of concept. Suppression of GH secretion was greater with the pasireotide 250 
µg dose than with the 100 µg dose. Using the AUC (0-24h) as a measure of the magnitude of inhibition of GH 
secretion, the mean change after treatment was 33.4% in the octreotide 100 µg dose group, and 35.4 % in the 
pasireotide 250 µg dose group compared to 19.0% in the pasireotide 100 µg dose group. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Studies C2305 and C2402 were considered pivotal for this application. Both studies were multicenter studies 
including  a  relevant  number  of  centres  in  Europe.  In  addition  data  from  three  phase  II  studies  have  been 
submitted. 
The choice of the pasireotide LAR dose regimen in Study C2305 and Study C2402 was based on the PK analysis 
results  from  Study  B2201  and  Study  C2110.  The  rationale  for  dose  selection  in  the  phase  III  studies  is 
acceptable.  
Study C2305 is a large prospective randomized study conducted in patients with acromegaly. This was a Phase 
3,  multicenter,  randomized,  blinded  study  of  pasireotide  LAR  vs.  octreotide  LAR  in  patients  with  active 
acromegaly who had not received previous medical treatment.

Page 79/122 
  
  
The  design  of  Study  2305  was  adequate  and  with  a  sufficient  duration  in  order  to  evaluate  the  effect  of 
pasireotide in medically naïve patients. The core phase of the study was 12 months followed by an extension 
phase. Data up to two years of treatment is provided. The stratification for patients having undergone surgery 
and those being totally treatment naïve is adequate. The choice of comparator is acceptable. The study design 
was further in line with the Scientific Advice given by the CHMP. With Amendment 4, blinding of the extension 
study was introduced. 
In study 2305, two sites were closed due to GCP issues; the handling of these issues was adequate.  
Several amendments were made to the study protocol. None of the amendments affected the analysis of the 
primary endpoint, thus the amendments are not considered to affect the outcome or the interpretation of the 
study.  Amendment  4  was  implemented  when  34  patients  had  already  been  unblinded.  The  exclusion  of 
responders to octreotide from the extension possibly leads to a slight overestimation of the long-term treatment 
difference between pasireotide and octreotide. Since the Applicant has not stated how many of the 13 patients 
in the octreotide arm discontinued due to the fact that they were responders, no estimation can be made but 
potentially the response rate of about 20 % observed in the core phase would have been maintained. Protocol 
deviations were relatively few.  
Study C2402 is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, three-arm study of double-blind pasireotide 
LAR 40 mg and pasireotide LAR 60 mg versus open-label octreotide LAR 30 mg or lanreotide ATG 120 mg in 
patients with inadequately controlled acromegaly. 
In this study the aim  was to  investigate the effect of pasireotide in a population inadequately controlled on 
existing therapies, i.e. maximal dose of octreotide LAR or lanreotide ATG. The study design and duration is 
considered adequate. Data is only presented for the 6 month core phase of the study. Available data from an 
interim analysis of the extension study was submitted with the responses to the Day 120 LoQ. This study was 
never subject for any Scientific Advice by the CHMP.  
Several amendments were made to the protocol. None of the amendments affected the analysis of the primary 
endpoint, thus the amendments are not considered to affect the outcome or the interpretation of the study. 
Protocol deviations were relatively evenly distributed between groups. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for both studies were adequate. It should be noted that patients with severe 
cardiac disease, including a high risk of arrhythmias, were excluded as were patients with poorly controlled 
diabetes mellitus.  
The treatment regimens were adequate. Dose adjustment was allowed and guidance on how and when to adjust 
the dose was in place. Notably, the long-acting treatment was introduced without any prior test of the patient’s 
tolerance to somatostatin analogue treatment. 
The objectives were adequate although the Scientific Advice recommended that a lower cut-off for GH (<2.0) 
should be considered. 
Efficacy assessments were adequate. The use of a 5-point mean GH is endorsed. The QoL questionnaire applied 
in both studies is acceptable and data to ensure the validation of the instrument has been provided (Badia et al 
2004).  
Statistical methods and sample size calculations were adequate. Randomisation procedures were adequate. 
Due to the different appearance of the pasireotide and octreotide LAR formulations, a true double-blind 
treatment was not feasible. In study 2305, adequate efforts were made to maintain the blinding of the study 
taking into consideration the difference in appearance with the study drug and the control. 
Assessment report

In study 2402, the patient, Investigator, site staff, monitor, and data manager were unblinded to the treatment 
arm assignment but were blinded to the treatment dose in the double-blind pasireotide LAR treatment arm. The 
blinding strategy is acceptable considering that the primary endpoint is based on an objective parameter, i.e. GH 
and IGF-1. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study C2305, dropout rates were slightly higher in the pasireotide treated group (20 %) than in the octreotide 
treated group (14 %). Slightly more patients in the pasireotide group terminated the study early due to AEs. The 
proportion of patients who did not enter the  extension was similar for both groups. More patients from  the 
pasireotide  treated  group  continued  in  the  extension  without  crossing  over  indicating  a  better  effect  in  this 
group. However, in the group that crossed over to pasireotide, more patients dropped out due to AEs. 
Baseline characteristics including baseline medical history were balanced between groups. Few patients over the 
age of 65 were included. The majority of patients were Caucasians. The proportion of patients with prior surgery 
was lower than expected (42 %) but balanced between groups.  
The study met its primary endpoint showing that the number of responders with pasireotide LAR (31 %) was 
significantly higher than for octreotide LAR (19 %; OR 1.94 (1.19, 3.17)). The primary analysis was consistently 
supported by the sensitivity analyses performed, thus the data appear robust. Response rates in patients that 
had undergone surgery were higher for both treatments and the overall outcome was mainly driven by this 
group.  Notably,  a  slightly  higher  proportion  in  the  pasireotide  treated  group  “over-responded”,  i.e.  GH 
decreased to <2.5 µg/L and IGF-1 <LLN. 
Of  note,  after  initiation  of  pivotal  studies,  the  GH  cut-off  associated  with  efficacy  response  was  revised 
(GH<1µg/L instead of <2.5µg/L). With the responses to the Day 120 LoQ, the Applicant performed a post-hoc 
analysis to obtain the proportion of patients who achieved a stricter endpoint (GH <1 μg/L and normal IGF-1, 
Giustina 2010) at month 12. With pasireotide LAR 40 mg, there was 29/176 (16.5%) of “responders” versus 
18/182 (9.9%) with octreotide LAR. The difference was not statistically significant and the lower bound of the 
95% CI was below unity (OR [95% CI 1.809 (0.964, 3.392] (p = 0.063)). 
The proportion of patients with an adequate GH response did not differ between treatment groups at Month 12 
(48 % vs 52 % for pasireotide and octreotide respectively). The difference in GH response was less prominent 
between post surgery and de novo patients. As shown by the separate analyses for GH and IGF-1 response, the 
outcome of the primary endpoint was mainly driven by a higher response with regards to IGF-1 with pasireotide 
LAR (39 %) compared to octreotide LAR (24 %). The difference in IGF-1 response was more prominent between 
post surgery and de novo patients. As the effect of GH is mediated via IGF-1, the findings support a clinically 
relevant effect of pasireotide.   
Both treatments showed comparable effects on tumour volume with a mean percent reduction of 38-39.7 %. 
The proportion of patients that achieved at least 20 % reduction was also comparable between treatments. The 
reduction in tumour size is reassuring since, although surgery is the first line therapy approach, surgery may not 
always be possible or available.   
In keeping with the data on GH reduction, slightly higher proportions of patients in the pasireotide group shifted 
to a lower GH category. Notably a higher proportion of patients in the pasireotide treated group had GH below 
1 µg/L, i.e. were “over-treated”.  
The data from the extension phase show that the rate of responders decreased somewhat over time, however, 
responder  rates  were  consistently  higher  in  the  pasireotide  treated  group  (24  %  vs  14  %  at  Month  25  for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 81/122 
  
  
pasireotide  and  octreotide  respectively;  OR  2.1  (1.14,  3.7)).  The  data  support  that  an  adequate  effect  is 
maintained at least up to two years of treatment. 
In the extension, the proportion of patients that maintained the GH response in the extension up to Month 25 
was  stable  in  both  groups  with  at  significantly  higher  proportion  in  the  pasireotide  treated  groups  being 
responders (35 % vs 24 % for pasireotide and octreotide respectively). GH values over time show that the most 
prominent effect is observed during the first three months, after which the GH levels remain rather stable. The 
additional effect observed at Month 16 is most likely due to a selection of patients since non-responders would 
have crossed over. 
Also  the proportion of responders with  regards to IGF-1  remained stable in  both  groups with a significantly 
higher proportion of responders in the pasireotide treated group (26 % vs 14 % for pasireotide and octreotide 
respectively).  Response  in  IGF-1  and  mean  standardised  IGF-1values  over  time  were  consistent  with  the 
observations on GH.  
Time to first response did not differ between treatments; however, duration of first response was longer in the 
pasireotide treated arm. When duration of response achieved at Month 12 was compared, no difference between 
treatments was observed.  
Although  no  adequate  comparison  can  be  made  between  treatments,  the  long-term  data  show  continuous 
decrease in tumour volume with continued treatment.  
An effect on PRL levels was shown with a more prominent effect of pasireotide compared to octreotide at Month 
12.  Reduction  of  PRL  levels  may  restore  fertility  in  female  acromegalic  patients  of  childbearing  potential. 
Therefore  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  has  been  amended  with  warnings  and  recommendations  that  adequate 
contraception should be used. 
Symptoms  of  acromegaly  improved  in  both  treatment  groups  with  no  significant  differences  observed. 
Improvements  with  regards  to  QoL  were  observed  in  both  groups,  with  numerically  better  results  in  the 
pasireotide treated group. It is acknowledged that the study was not powered to detect a significant difference 
in this analysis. 
In study C2402, discontinuations were low but slightly higher in the pasireotide treated groups (9 % and 12 % 
for the pasireotide 40 mg and 60 mg groups compared to 4 % in the active comparator group), largely due to a 
higher proportion of patients dropping out due to AEs. In this context it should be noted that patients in the 
active control arm already were known to tolerate their treatment since the inclusion criteria stated that they 
should have been treated with maximum doses for at least 6 months. 
Baseline characteristics including baseline medical history were balanced between groups. Few patients over the 
age  of  65  were  included.  The  majority  of  patients  were  Caucasians.  Most  of  the  patients  were  on  previous 
treatment with octreotide LAR at inclusion. 
The study met its primary endpoint and the outcome was confirmed by the sensitivity analyses performed, thus 
the  finding  appears  robust.  Thus  with  pasireotide  treatment  additional  previously  inadequately  controlled 
patients achieved response. Furthermore, a dose-response effect was observed with more patients responding 
on pasireotide 60 mg (23 %) than on pasireotide 40 mg (17 %), although not formally tested. No responders 
were observed in the active control group. 
In study C2402, the proportion of uncontrolled patients who achieved a response at week 24 with the new and 
stricter criteria of acromegalic treatments’ response (GH<1 µg/L and IGF-1 normalisation, Giustina 2010) was 
calculated. Statistically significant difference was obtained only with the dose of 60 mg pasireotide LAR versus 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 82/122 
  
  
comparator (OR [CI (2.06, infinity)] (p = 0.0059) but not with the dose of 40 mg LAR pasireotide (p = 0.0556, 
OR [95% CI (0.95, infinity)]). Thus a trend to a better efficacy of pasireotide LAR in uncontrolled patients is 
revealed from these results. 
No meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the outcome by randomisation strata due to the 
low number of patients in the lanreotide strata, The outcome of the primary endpoint was mainly driven by the 
patients on octreotide. Also in the second randomisation stratum (GH > or < 10 µg/L), the number of patients 
with very high GH was too low for any conclusions to be drawn. 
The proportion of patients with normalised IGF-1 was significantly higher in the pasireotide treated groups with 
a less pronounced difference between the two doses (26 % vs 25 % for the 40 mg and 60 mg dose groups 
respectively). No responders were observed in the control group. The key secondary endpoint thus supports the 
outcome of the primary endpoint. 
The proportion of patients responding with regards to GH was significantly higher for both doses of pasireotide 
(35 % vs 43 % for the 40 mg and 60 mg dose groups respectively) compared to active control (13 %). A dose 
response effect was observed with a higher response rate in the pasireotide 60 mg group. 
The change from baseline in GH at 24 weeks and over time in the active control arm was strongly affected by one 
patient with very high GH levels which makes comparison with the pasireotide treated groups difficult. However, 
in the pasireotide treated groups a slight decrease in GH levels was observed across the study period with a 
similar decrease in both dose groups.  
A  more  pronounced  effect  on  standardised  IGF-1  levels  was  observed  in  the  pasireotide  treated  groups 
compared to the octreotide treated group, with no apparent difference between the two doses. 
The analysis of response categories based on randomisation strata is hampered by the small size of the study, 
precluding any firm conclusion. Numerically, a somewhat weaker response was observed in patients previously 
treated with lanreotide and in patients with high GH levels at inclusion.  
A reduction in tumour volume was observed in all treatment groups with no apparent difference between the two 
doses  of  pasireotide.  Notably,  a  number  of  patients  in  each  group  showed  an  increase  in  tumour  volume 
emphasising the need for continuous monitoring of tumour status. 
No significant changes in acromegaly symptoms or QoL were observed in this short-term study. 
Interim data from the extension of study C2402 were provided with the responses to the Day 120 LoQ. These 
data support maintenance of effect of pasireotide up to one year in patients not responding to other SSAs. The 
rate of new responders recruited in the “cross-over to pasireotide” group was in line with that observed in the 
core phase of the study. 
The outcome in patients that crossed-over from octreotide to pasireotide and vice versa in study C2305 was also 
provided.  This  dataset  provides  supportive  data  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  with  octreotide  LAR  or 
pasireotide  LAR.  Notably,  a  larger  proportion  of  patients  responded  in  the  group  that  crossed-over  from 
octreotide to pasireotide (17 %) than in the group that crossed over from pasireotide, where no responders were 
observed at Month 12. 
The analysis of the different response categories showed that the rate of FR increased with pasireotide after 
cross-over, whereas the rate of PR remained constant. In the octreotide treated group, the rate of FR decreased 
and the rate of PR increased, however, numbers were very low. Over-response was reported in about 10 % of 
patients treated with pasireotide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 83/122 
  
  
In  line  with  the  composite  endpoint,  the  proportion  of  patients  reaching  the  GH  target  was  higher  in  the 
pasireotide treated group. Notably, 24 % of patients in the octreotide treated group reached the GH target 
whereas  no  patients  reached  FR  at  12  months.  In  patients  treated  with  pasireotide  after  cross-over,  GH 
continued to decrease, whereas GH slightly increased in the octreotide treated group.   A higher proportion of 
patients who were treated with pasireotide after cross-over shifted to a lower GH category than in the octreotide 
group. 
An improvement in GH nadir values after OGTT was observed with both treatments. Although the improvement 
was numerically greater with pasireotide, comparisons between treatments are not meaningful due to the low 
numbers. 
A higher proportion of patients on pasireotide showed a response with regards to IGF-1 compared to octreotide. 
Notably more patients in the pasireotide group also showed an over-response.  In line with the observations on 
GH over time, IGF-1 decreased over time in the group crossed-over to pasireotide whereas IGF-1 remained 
stable in the octreotide treated group.   
A higher proportion of the patients treated with pasireotide after cross-over showed a decrease or no change in 
tumour volume; however absolute change in tumour volume did not differ between treatment groups. 
PRL levels decreased in the patients treated with pasireotide after cross-over, whereas no change in PRL levels 
was observed in the octreotide treated group at Month 12.  
Acromegaly symptoms improved slightly in the pasireotide treated group after cross-over. Improvements in ring 
size were observed but did not differ between groups. QoL scores remained stable and did not differ between 
groups. 
Due to the underlying difference in study design between studies C2305 and C2402, no pooling of data was 
performed for sub-group analysis. Sub-group analyses by race, ethnicity or age were performed in both study 
C2305 and C2402, however these analyses were hampered by the sizes of the studies. No clinically relevant 
differences in treatment effect were observed due to race, ethnicity or age. 
No  studies  in  special  populations  were  conducted.  Considering  that  acromegaly  is  a  rare  condition,  this  is 
acceptable. 
Study C2110 was an open-label, randomized study assessing PK, safety, and tolerability profiles of 20, 40, and 
60 mg doses of pasireotide LAR in patients with acromegaly or carcinoid disease. Following the completion of the 
core study patients were eligible to enter the extension Study C2110E1. In this small short-term study, three 
doses of pasireotide LAR were compared. A rapid decrease in GH, with a somewhat slower decrease in IGF-1 was 
observed for all doses. A dose response relationship was observed, although not statistically significant. 
Study B2201 was an open-label, randomized, crossover study in patients with acromegaly receiving multiple 
doses of pasireotide sc and octreotide sc to assess efficacy, safety, and PK/PD relationship. After completion of 
the 16-week core treatment period, patients were allowed to enroll into the extension. This study investigated 
the subcutaneous pasireotide formulation at different doses. The highest response rate was observed with the 
600 µg bid dose. 
The proof-of-concept study B2103 was a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in patients with acromegaly 
to  assess  efficacy  of  single-dose  pasireotide  sc  vs.  octreotide  sc.  A  suppression  of  GH  comparable  to  that 
achieved with octreotide 100 µg was observed with the pasireotide 250 µg dose.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The application was supported by two well-designed and well-conducted studies of considerable size; taking into 
account that acromegaly is a rare disease. 
The primary endpoint (percentage of responders defined as a reduction of GH level to < 2.5 μg/L and normalized 
IGF-1) was met in study C2305 and study C2402.  
Further long term data will be provided as extension studies in both categories of patients are ongoing. Data up 
to 26 months of treatment in medically naïve and 12 month data in patients inadequately controlled have been 
provided showing that the efficacy of pasireotide appears to be maintained over time. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Data describing the safety profile of pasireotide comes mainly from the two pivotal studies C2305 and C2402, 
which both are of considerable size considering that acromegaly is a rare disease. Supportive data is available 
from  studies  C2110/C2110E1  (with  the  LAR  formulation),  studies  B2201/B2201E  and  B2103  (with  the 
subcutaneous formulation) as well as from studies in healthy volunteers.

Patient exposure 
Table 29 Clinical studies providing safety data in acromegaly with pasireotide LAR 
Exposure in medically naïve patients 
The mean duration of exposure to study  drug in the core phase  (i.e.  up  to Month  12) was similar between 
pasireotide LAR (300.8 days) and octreotide LAR (315.7 days). The median number of injections was 12 in both

groups, and over 80% of patients had received more than 9 injections. Two patients in the pasireotide group and 
6 patients in the octreotide group mistakenly received a 13th injection in the core phase and did not enter the 
extension study. 
The mean duration of exposure across the core and extension for patients who continued the same treatment in 
the  extension  was  longer  in  the  pasireotide  LAR  group  (527.2 days)  than  in  the  octreotide  LAR  group 
(414.6 days) (Table 30). This imbalance is at least partly due to the fact that patients on octreotide who reached 
Month 12  prior  to  Amendment 4  could  not  continue  with  octreotide  in  the  extension  (15  patients  in 
pasireotide LAR and 19 in octreotide LAR, completed the core phase prior to Amendment 4). Additionally the 
lower  response  rate  in  octreotide  could  have  an  impact,  reducing  the  number  of  patients  continuing  with 
octreotide in the extension as per protocol. Furthermore, patients receiving octreotide in the extension (allowed 
post-Amendment 4) were not followed after Month 26. This imbalance can also be seen in the proportion of 
patients with more than 26 injections (pasireotide LAR: 30.9%, octreotide LAR: 2.8%).

In Study C2402 the mean duration of exposure to study drug in the core phase (up to 24 weeks of treatment) 
was similar between pasireotide LAR 40 mg, pasireotide LAR 60 mg and the active control (octreotide LAR or 
lanreotide LAR) (Table 31). The median number of injections was 6 in all groups.

Exposure in supportive studies with LAR formulation 
In Study C2110 patients were randomized to receive pasireotide LAR 20 mg, 40 mg or 60 mg for 3 months (i.e. 
3 injections, q28d). All 35 patients who started pasireotide LAR treatment completed the planned 3 months of 
pasireotide  LAR  treatment.  The  mean  duration  of  exposure  was  approximately  84 days  for  each  of  the 
respective dose groups. 
After completing Study C2110 patients could continue the same treatment in the optional extension C2110E. In 
the extension, the dose could be increased or decreased by 20 mg at any time (smallest allowed dose: 20 mg; 
maximum  dose:  60  mg).  For  the  29  patients  that  continued  in  the  extension  phase,  the  mean  duration  of 
exposure to pasireotide LAR across the core and extension was 1138.9 days. 
Exposure in supportive studies with sc formulation 
Study B2201/E 
In Study B2201 (core phase), all patients received first octreotide 100 μg sc tid for 28 days. Each patient was 
randomized to one of six treatment sequence groups to receive successively either pasireotide 200 μg, 400 μg, 
or 600 μg sc bid, over three consecutive periods of 28 days. For the 60 patients who were treated in the core 
phase, the overall mean duration of exposure was 84.3 days. For the 30 patients who continued in the extension 
phase, the mean duration of exposure (calculated across core and extension) was 29.2 months. 
Study B2103 
In  Study  B2103,  twelve  patients  received  a  single  sc  dose  of  pasireotide  100 µg,  pasireotide  250 µg,  and 
octreotide 100 µg in a crossover design with a minimum of 6 days washout between each treatment.  
Exposure in healthy volunteer studies 
Healthy volunteer studies with pasireotide LAR formulation 
Subjects in Study B2116, Study C2112, and Study C2101 were administered pasireotide sc formulation (300 µg 
in C2101, dose range 300 to 900 µg in B2116 and C2112) prior to administration of a single dose of pasireotide 
LAR (range 10 to 60 mg). 
Subjects in Study G1101 and C2111 were only administered pasireotide LAR. Subjects in Study G1101 received 
a single dose of pasireotide LAR (10, 20, 40 or 60 mg). Subjects in Study C2111 were administered pasireotide 
LAR  60  mg  from  2  different  manufacturing  plants  in  a  2-way  crossover  design,  thus  the  majority  of  these 
subjects received 2 doses of pasireotide LAR (1 from each plant). 
A total of 311 subjects received pasireotide LAR in these healthy volunteer studies (42 subjects in Study B2116, 
45 subjects in Study C2112, 78 subjects in Study C2101, 114 subjects in Study C2111, and 32 subjects in Study 
G1101). 
Special safety studies (pasireotide sc) 
A total of 448 subjects received pasireotide sc in these studies. 
Adverse events 
Due  to  the  similarities  in  the  pasireotide  safety  profile  between  medically  naïve  patients  and  patients 
inadequately  controlled  a  pooled  analysis  of  all  safety  data  for  studies  2305  and  2402  was  performed  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014

presented  with  the  responses  to  the  Day  120  LoQ.  These  tables  are  given  below  (Table  33  and  Table  34) 
followed by descriptions of the safety findings in the separate studies. 
Common adverse events in the pooled data set 
Table 33 Adverse events (>5% in the All grades column) regardless of study drug 
relationship – pooled data (Safety analysis set) 
Common adverse events in medically naïve patients 
AEs profile up to crossover (i.e. up to data cut-off for patients who continued the same treatment in the 
extension, and up to crossover for those who did not) was in keeping with known profile of patients on 
pasireotide.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014

Most patients (94.1%) experienced at least one AE. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequent SOC in 
both treatment groups, 64.0% for pasireotide LAR vs. 72.8% for octreotide LAR. The largest difference between 
the treatment groups was observed for the SOC metabolism and nutrition disorders, 64.0% for pasireotide LAR 
vs. 33.3% for octreotide LAR.  
AEs  that  were  more  frequent  (at  least  5%  difference)  in  the  pasireotide  LAR  group  were  mostly  related  to 
glucose metabolism: hyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus, blood glucose increased, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
AEs that were less frequent in the pasireotide LAR than octreotide LAR were mostly related to GI disorders: 
diarrhoea (39.9% vs. 45.0%), cholelithiasis (32.6% vs. 39.4%), abdominal pain (18.5% vs. 24.4%), nausea 
(15.2% vs. 22.8%) and constipation (5.6% vs. 10.6%).  
SSAs are known to cause alopecia. The difference in AEs of alopecia between Study C2305 (19.1% in pasireotide 
and 20% in octreotide) and Study C2402 (1.6% and 6.5% for pasireotide 40 mg and 60 mg and none in the 
active control) is likely due to all patients in Study C2402 having prior exposure to SSA and would therefore have 
developed alopecia prior to study entry. 
The most common grades 3-4 AEs for pasireotide LAR group were diabetes mellitus (5.1%) and hyperglycaemia 
and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (3.4% each). In the octreotide LAR group most common grade 3-4 
AEs were diarrhoea (2.8%) and headache (2.8%).  
Common AEs in inadequately controlled patients 
In  Study  C2402  most  patients  in  all  3  treatment  groups  experienced  at  least  one  AE  during  the  study. 
Metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  was  the  most  frequent  SOC  in  all  3  treatment  groups.  The  three  most 
common AEs in the pasireotide LAR 40 mg and 60 mg groups were hyperglycaemia (33.3% and 30.6%) and 
diabetes mellitus (20.6% and 25.8%), followed by diarrhoea (15.9% and 19.4%). In the active control group 
they were hyperglycaemia and cholelithiasis (13.6% each) and diabetes mellitus (7.6%). The type of AEs is 
similar  to  what  was  reported  for  medically  naïve  patients  in  Study C2305.  The  patients  treated  with 
pasireotide LAR (40 mg and 60 mg) had a higher incidence of grades 3-4 AEs than the patients treated with the 
active control (17.5% and 19.4% vs. 7.6%). 
In the Study C2305 after crossover  results were similar to Study C2402  and pooled inadequately controlled 
analysis (patient from Studies C2402 and C2305 after crossover). The most frequent AEs were hyperglycaemia 
(30.9%)  and  diarrhoea  (24.7%)  in  the  pasireotide LAR  group  and  diarrhoea  (18.4%)  and  nasopharyngitis 
(18.4%)  in  the  octreotide LAR  group.  The  patients  treated  with  pasireotide  LAR  had  more  high  grades  AEs 
(28.4%  vs.  21.1%  in  octreotide  LAR).  The  difference  was  mainly  due  to  a  higher  frequency  of  grade 3-4 
hyperglycaemia (4.9% vs. none) and diabetes mellitus (2.5% vs. none). 
Common adverse events in supportive studies  
Common  adverse  event  with  pasireotide  LAR  and  sc  formulations  in  supportive  studies  in  the  acromegaly 
population and healthy volunteers are consistent with those observed in Study C2305, with GI disturbances and 
hyperglycaemia (mostly grade 1 or 2) being the most commonly observed events.

Events suspected to be drug-related in the pooled data set 
Table 34 Adverse events (>5% in the All grades column) suspected to be drug related – 
pooled data (Safety analysis set) 
Events suspected to be drug-related in medically naïve patients 
In Study C2305 up to cross over AEs that were suspected to be related to study drug by the investigator showed 
similar profiles to the known safety profile of pasireotide and octreotide. The most frequent AEs overall were 
diarrhoea and cholelithiasis, and these were more frequent in the octreotide LAR group than in the pasireotide 
LAR group. In addition nausea was also more frequent in the octreotide LAR group. Study drug-related AEs that 
were more frequent in the pasireotide LAR group (by at least 5%) were all related to glucose metabolism 
(hyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus, blood glucose increased, and type 2 diabetes mellitus). In the octreotide 
arm the AEs that were more frequent than in pasireotide arm (by at least 5%) were diarrhoea, cholelithiasis, and 
nausea. Grade 3 or 4 AEs related to glucose metabolism (hyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus) were more frequent in the pasireotide LAR group, whereas grade 3-4 diarrhoea was more frequent in 
the octreotide LAR group. 
Events suspected to be drug-related in inadequately controlled patients 
In Study C2402 and for the pooled analysis on inadequately controlled patients, AEs suspected to be related to 
study  drug  showed  similar  profiles  to  the  known  safety  profiles  of  pasireotide LAR  and  the  active  control 
(octreotide LAR and lanreotide ATG). The most frequent AEs overall were hyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus, 
diarrhoea,  and  cholelithiasis.  In  Study  C2402  AEs  suspected  to  be  related  to  study  drugs  that  were  more 
frequent  (at  least  5%  difference)  in  the  pasireotide LAR  groups  than  in  the  active  control  group  were 
hyperglycaemia,  diabetes  mellitus,  blood  glucose  increase  and  diarrhoea.  Grade  3-4  events  reported  in  the 
pasireotide groups were generally related to hyperglycaemia. No grade 3 or grade 4 AEs were reported in the 
active control group. 
In Study C2305 after crossover AEs suspected to be drug related that were more frequent (>5% difference) in 
patients  treated  with  pasireotide  LAR  compared  to  octreotide LAR  were  similar  to  those  in  Study  C2402 
(hyperglycaemia-related AEs and diarrhoea). In addition the incidences of cholelithiasis and headache were also 
higher (>5%) in patients who crossed over to pasireotide while the incidence of blood creatine phosphokinase

increased and abdominal  distension were higher  in  the octreotide group. Most study drug-related AEs  were 
grade 1-2.

In medically naïve patients in Study C2305, SAEs were experienced by 19.7% of patients on pasireotide LAR 
and 15.0% of patients on octreotide LAR (Table 35). The most frequent SAEs overall were those related to the 
gallbladder (6 vs. 5 patients on pasireotide LAR vs. octreotide LAR). Most of these events resolved following 
cholecystectomy and/or medical therapy, and none led to discontinuation. These were also the most frequent 
SAEs overall with suspected relationship to study drug.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 94/122 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SAEs related to glucose metabolism occurred in 5 patients on pasireotide LAR (all related to increased blood 
glucose) and one patient on octreotide LAR (hypoglycemia in a patient treated with insulin); these patients were 
all either pre-diabetic or diabetic at baseline. Three of the 5 patients in the pasireotide LAR group discontinued 
study drug. 
Although the SAE profile by individual preferred terms was generally comparable between the treatments, SAEs 
led to discontinuation only in the pasireotide LAR group (9 patients). Four of these cases were due to study 
drug-related events: 3 patients had hyperglycaemia-related events and a fourth patient discontinued due to 
worsened fatigue.  
In inadequately controlled patients in Study C2402, SAEs occurred in 9.5%, 3.2% and 4.5% of patients in 
the pasireotide LAR 40 mg, 60 mg and active control groups, respectively (Table 36). SAEs considered related 
to study drug were reported for 3 patients on pasireotide LAR: 2 patients in the 40 mg group (one patient with 
anemia and hyperglycaemia, and one patient with blood glucose increased) and one patient in the 60 mg group 
(hyperglycaemia). None of these events led to discontinuation. In Study C2305, SAEs occurred in 9.9% and 
15.8%  of  patients  who  crossed  over  to  pasireotide  LAR  and  octreotide  LAR,  respectively.  SAEs  considered 
related to study drug were cholelithiasis (2 patients who crossed to pasireotide LAR and 1 patient who crossed 
to octreotide LAR, and type 2 diabetes in a patient who crossed to pasireotide LAR). The type 2 diabetes led to 
discontinuation, whereas the 3 cases of cholelithiasis resolved after the patients underwent cholecystectomy. 
SAEs in the supportive acromegaly studies and healthy volunteers were in line with those seen in Study C2305.  
Deaths 
Four deaths (1 in the core and 3 in the extension) were reported on treatment in Study C2305. Two deaths 
occurred on pasireotide LAR treatment and the other 2 deaths occurred on octreotide LAR treatment. None of 
the  deaths  were  considered  related  to  the  study  treatment  by  the  investigator.  Close  examination  of  the  4 
deaths (myocardial infarction, septic shock, suicide, and aortic aneurysm rupture, respectively) revealed no 
consistent pattern in the nature or timing of the events or suspected causality to study treatment deaths. 
Adverse events of special interest 
A comprehensive analysis using grouped AE terms was performed to characterize AEs that are considered to be 
of special interest in connection with pasireotide treatment. A total of 20 groups of AEs of special interest were 
defined.  
This analysis was performed using data from studies C2305, C2402 and C2110/E in patients with acromegaly. 
The overall incidence of AEs of special interest is shown in Table 35 (Study C2305) and Table 36 (Study C2402 
and  Study  C2305  after  crossover).  Those  AEs  of  special  interest  that  represent  the  most  important  clinical 
concerns  with  pasireotide  LAR  treatment  are  discussed  below  (Special  safety  topics).  These  are: 
hyperglycaemia,  QT  prolongation,  bradycardia,  liver  safety,  gallbladder  and  related  events  and  pituitary 
hormones.  Other  safety  topics  which  were  considered  to  warrant  commentary  are  gastrointestinal  events, 
pancreatitis-related events, and injection-site reactions; these are briefly discussed below. 
Gastrointestinal events 
GI-related  events  are  a  known  class  effect  of  SSAs  and  were  the  most  commonly  observed  events  with 
pasireotide  treatment  across  the  development  program.  In  medically  naïve  patients,  diarrhoea-related  and 
nausea-related  events  were  reported  in  39.9%  and  19.1%  of  patients  on  pasireotide  LAR,  and  45.0%  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 95/122 
  
  
25.6% of patients on octreotide LAR (Table 35). Diarrhoea and nausea were approximately twice more frequent 
in the first 3 months of pasireotide LAR treatment than in the following time intervals. 
Diarrhoea and nausea events were also common in inadequately controlled patients, however the incidences 
were  generally  lower  than  for  medically  naïve  patients  (Table  35,  Table  36),  most  likely  because  patients’ 
tolerance to treatment improves over time. This is further supported by the low incidence of diarrhoea-related 
events (4.5%) among patients who continued their previous treatment in the control group of Study C2402.  
Pancreatitis-related events 
Pancreatitis is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of SSAs. Adverse events potentially linked to 
pancreatitis (e.g. abdominal distension, lipase increased) were observed at comparable rates with pasireotide 
LAR and active control in the Phase 3 studies; the overall incidences were higher in medically naïve patients 
(16.9% and 17.8% for pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR) than on pasireotide LAR in inadequately controlled 
patients (<4%; Table 35, Table 36). One patient discontinued due to such an event (a patient on pasireotide LAR 
with acute pancreatitis not suspected to be related to study medication by the investigator). 
In  supportive  acromegaly  studies  C2110/E,  B2201/E  or  B2103,  no  patient  discontinued  due  to  a 
pancreatitis-related event. 
Elevations in lipase values were observed on both pasireotide LAR and active control. In Study C2305, elevations 
(mostly grade 1-2) were seen in around 25% of patients in each group. Similar results were seen after crossover 
to pasireotide LAR, with slightly lower rates (around 10 % of patients had grade 1-2 lipase) after crossover to 
octreotide LAR. In Study C2402, lipase elevations were rare. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reaction-related AEs (e.g. injection site pain, injection site discomfort) were all grade 1 or 2 in 
severity, and seen in ~8% of medically naïve patients. The incidence of such events was highest in the first 3 
months of treatment. Injection site reaction-related AEs were less frequent in inadequately controlled patients 
(≤ 3% in any treatment group) (Table 35, Table 36). 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Haematology  findings  with  pasireotide  were  consistent  with  known  SSA  effects,  and  in  line  with  preclinical 
findings  of  decreased  erythropoiesis  due  to  IGF-1  suppression  and  binding  of  pasireotide  to  SSTRs  on 
hematopoietic precursor cells. Slight decreases in hemoglobin levels (typically grade 1) were the most frequent 
observation in clinical studies with pasireotide.

Overall,  in  studies  C2305  and  C2402,  there  were  no  changes  from  baseline  to  last  value  in  PT  and  PTT 
parameters, and no clinically relevant shifts from baseline were observed. 
Clinical chemistry 
The results for other biochemistry parameters were consistent with the expected safety profile of SSAs. In the 
Phase 3 studies C2305 and C2402, newly occurring or worsened abnormalities in electrolytes, blood lipids, and 
renal parameters were mostly grade 1-2, and comparable on pasireotide LAR and active control. Findings in 
supportive acromegaly studies C2110/E and B2201/E were consistent with those in the Phase 3 studies.

Urinalysis 
Urinalysis results did not reveal any findings of clinical concern. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
A common abnormality in Study C2305 up to crossover was low pulse rate (16.9% vs. 12.2% for pasireotide LAR 
vs. octreotide LAR), which is expected considering the known bradycardic effect of SSAs. Weight decrease of ≥ 
10% was seen for 22.5% vs. 8.9% of patients in the respective groups up to crossover. This finding may be 
related to decreases in IGF-1 levels. After crossover, weight decrease ≥ 10% was reported for 12.3% vs. 2.6% 
of patients, and an increase in weight for 4.9% vs. 5.3% of patients, respectively. Findings in supportive studies 
C2110/E and B2201/E were consistent with these results. 
Special safety topics 
Special safety topics were defined based on knowledge of SSA class effects, and emerging clinical experience 
with pasireotide using the sc and LAR formulations. The evaluation of these topics in the sections below is based 
on analysis of AEs of special interests, as well as laboratory investigations, ECG and gallbladder ultrasound as 
relevant. 
Glucose Metabolism 
Hyperglycaemia-related events in patients with acromegaly  
In medically naïve patients, the incidence of hyperglycaemia-related events (e.g. diabetes mellitus, 
hyperglycaemia, blood glucose increased) was higher on pasireotide LAR (63.5%) than octreotide LAR (25.0%), 
and more patients had events that were grade 3 or 4 on pasireotide LAR (9.0% vs. 1.7% on octreotide LAR). The 
results were similar for inadequately controlled patients, where 60-80% of patients on pasireotide LAR 
experienced such events, compared to 20-40% of those on active control; grade 3-4 events were reported only 
for those on pasireotide LAR (10-15%). Hyperglycaemia-related AE led to study drug discontinuation more often 
from pasireotide LAR (3.4% in medically naïve patients, 1.6% to 6.5% in inadequately controlled patients in 
Study C2402) than from active control (<2% overall). Hyperglycaemia-related events were also observed AEs 
in studies C2110/E and B2201. 
Time-interval analysis of hyperglycaemia-related AEs in studies C2305 and C2110E indicated that the incidence 
of these events was higher in the first 3 months of treatment than subsequent time intervals analyzed, but 
increased again with longer treatment. 
Two cases of hyperglycaemia-related emergencies requiring hospitalization were reported in Study C2305 (one 
case of diabetic ketoacidosis, and one case of hyperglycaemic coma). Both events occurred after pasireotide LAR 
dose was increased from 40 mg to 60 mg. Both patients had elevated FPG levels prior to the dose increase, and 
neither patient was receiving any anti-hyperglycaemic agents at the time. Both patients recovered; study drug 
was discontinued for one patient  and the other patient continued in the study. No such events were reported in 
Study C2402. 
Patients with impaired glucose metabolism at baseline are at a higher risk of developing hyperglycaemia-related 
AEs that are severe or serious, and to require discontinuation of treatment. Among medically naïve patients the 
incidence of grade 3-4 AEs on pasireotide LAR was higher in diabetic patients (18.9%) than those who were 
pre-diabetic (5.9%) or had normal glucose tolerance (3.5%). Hyperglycaemia-related SAEs were more frequent 
in diabetic patients (5.7%) than pre-diabetic patients (2.9%); none were reported in those with normal glucose

tolerance. The rate of discontinuation was also higher among diabetics (9.4%) than pre-diabetics (0%) or those 
with normal glucose tolerance (1.8%). The results for inadequately controlled patients were consistent with 
those  in  medically  naïve  patients,  with  hyperglycaemia-related  grade 3  AEs  reported  in  15-25%  of  diabetic 
patients vs. <3% of pre-diabetics, and none in those with normal glucose tolerance receiving pasireotide LAR. 
Hyperglycaemia-related  SAEs,  or  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  were  only  reported  in  patients  who  were 
diabetic at baseline.  
FPG and HbA1c in patients with acromegaly 
In medically naïve patients, a more pronounced increase in FPG and HbA1c levels was observed with pasireotide 
LAR  than  octreotide  LAR.  Mean  FPG  and  HbA1c  levels  peaked  within  the  first  3  months  of  treatment  with 
pasireotide LAR (mean increase from baseline to Month 3: FPG +33.3 mg/dL, HbA1c +0.90%), followed by a 
slight decrease and stabilization (mean increase from baseline to Month 12: FPG +27.1 mg/dL, HbA1c +0.78%; 
Figure 11). For octreotide LAR, a much smaller and slower increase was seen for mean FPG and HbA1c, with 
highest levels attained after 9-12 months of treatment (mean increase from baseline to Month 12: FPG +5.1 
mg/dL, HbA1c +0.17%). In inadequately controlled patients, FPG and HbA1c levels increased in patients treated 
with pasireotide LAR. Similar to medically naïve patients, the levels peaked initially and then remained stable. At 
the end of the 6-month core phase in Study C2402, the mean increase in FPG was +22.9 mg/dL and +40.5 
mg/dL for pasireotide LAR 40 mg and 60 mg, respectively; the respective values for HbA1c were +0.77% and 
+1.08%.

crossover (SAS) 
The numbers xx/xx at the bottom are the numbers of patients in pasireotide/octreotide treatment group at the respective time 
points. 
The pasireotide-induced hyperglycaemia is reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. This is demonstrated 
by the rapid decrease in FPG and HbA1c levels in patients who crossed from pasireotide LAR to octreotide LAR 
in Study C2305, with FPG and HbA1c stabilizing at levels comparable to those of medically naive patients treated 
with octreotide LAR (Figure 12). Furthermore, for patients who discontinued pasireotide LAR treatment, FPG 
levels were lower at the follow-up safety assessment, however the duration of the safety follow-up was not 
sufficiently long (<60 days) to allow FPG levels to return to baseline levels.

The numbers xx/xx at the bottom are the numbers of patients in pasireotide/octreotide treatment group. 
Shifts in FPG and HbA1c were analyzed based on American Diabetes Association categories (ADA 2010). In 
Study C2305, around 60% of patients on pasireotide LAR had shifted to a higher FPG and HbA1c category by 
their last assessment, compared to around 30% for octreotide LAR, and the shifts tended to be to higher 
categories than for octreotide LAR. Similar results were seen for inadequately controlled patients, where around 
60% of patients shifted to a worse category on pasireotide LAR, compared to 20% on active control. In Study 
C2402, more shifts to the highest categories occurred on the 60 mg than the 40 mg pasireotide LAR dose. It 
should be noted that for both pasireotide LAR and active control there were also shifts from a higher baseline 
category to a lower category at the last assessment, indicating that there was substantial inter-patient 
variability in the hyperglycaemic effect for both pasireotide LAR and active control.  
Consistent with the observation of a peak in FPG levels at Month 3, analyses of shifts to most extreme value on 
treatment showed a higher proportion of patients shifting to a worse category compared to analysis of shifts to 
last available value for both medically naïve and inadequately controlled patients. These results indicate that 
many patients who initially shifted to a higher category shifted to a lower category by the last assessment. These 
results were consistent with those observed in C2110E, where time-interval analysis showed that the majority 
of shifts occurred within the first 6 months of treatment, and that some patients shifted to a lower ADA category 
with continued treatment. 
Analyses of hyperglycaemia by  patient's  baseline  diabetic  status (diabetic, pre-diabetic, normal glucose 
tolerance) in medically naïve patients show that the peak increase seen after 3 months of treatment in FPG and 
HbA1c  were  substantially  higher  in  diabetic  patients  than  in  pre-diabetics  or  those  with  normal  glucose 
tolerance, but decreased in diabetic patients over time and stabilized at a lower level. The incremental increase 
in mean FPG and HbA1c from baseline to last value on treatment was similar in all diabetic status subgroups 
(FPG: mean increase 15 to 20 mg/dL, HbA1c: mean  increase 0.6 to 0.9%).  This suggests that the level of 
hyperglycaemia induced by pasireotide can be predicted based on a patient's baseline diabetic status; however 
it should be kept in mind that the responses in individual patients may vary. Data from inadequately controlled 
Assessment report

patients in Study C2305 after crossover are consistent, showing that the absolute increase in FPG and HbA1c 
with pasireotide LAR is largely independent of a patient’s diabetic status. However, this was not the case in 
Study  C2402,  where  the  increase  was  proportionally  higher  in  diabetic  patients  than  in  the  normal  and 
pre-diabetic patients. This may be because the duration of the core study was shorter (24 weeks), therefore the 
full effect of the anti-diabetic intervention on FPG and HbA1c may not have been seen by the time of data cut-off. 
Analyses of anti-diabetic medication use in Study C2305 for patients with a FPG and/or HbA1c abnormality 
indicates  that  pasireotide-induced  hyperglycaemia  responds  to  medication.  Mean  FPG  levels  decreased  in 
patients  who  developed,  or  had  a  worsening  of  hyperglycaemia,  and  who  were  treated  with  anti-diabetic 
medication.  
The improvement in mean FPG and HbA1c levels observed after the initial peak at Month 3 is most likely due to 
a combination of several factors, such as dose adjustment, anti-diabetic intervention, improvement in GH and 
IGF-1 levels with pasireotide LAR treatment, and attenuation of the hyperglycaemic effect of pasireotide over 
time. It should be noted that the study was not designed to address the contribution of different factors on the 
progression of hyperglycaemia. 
Analyses  of  hyperglycaemia  in  relation  to  efficacy  response  revealed  that  patients  who  achieved 
biochemical control on pasireotide LAR developed, on average, less hyperglycaemia than those  who did not 
achieve biochemical control. The effect was clearer in medically naïve than in inadequately controlled patients. 
A similar trend of a lower degree of hyperglycaemia in responders was seen for octreotide LAR in Study C2305, 
suggesting that this phenomenon is common among SSAs. The underlying mechanism is not fully understood, 
but may be related to the known insulin resistance caused by GH excess.  
Analyses of response  rate  by  baseline  diabetes  status in medically naïve patients showed that response 
rates at Month 12 for both pasireotide  LAR vs. octreotide  LAR were  higher for patients with normal glucose 
tolerance  at  baseline  (42.1%  vs.  22.0%),  intermediate  for  pre-diabetics  (30.9%  vs.  21.9%),  and  lowest  in 
diabetics  (20.8%  vs.  13.6%).  These  results  also  show  that  pasireotide  LAR  is  superior  to  octreotide  LAR 
regardless of a patient's diabetic status at baseline. In inadequately controlled patients, response rates were 
higher in patients with normal glucose tolerance than those who were pre-diabetic or diabetic at baseline. 
QT prolongation in patients with acromegaly 
The proportion of patients with notable ECG cardiac conduction intervals was comparable on pasireotide LAR and 
active control both in medically naïve and in inadequately controlled patients. Around 10-20% of patients had a 
QTcF >450 ms, less than 2% had QTcF >480 ms, and none had QTcF >500 ms. No trend towards prolongation 
of mean QTcF values over time was seen for either pasireotide LAR or active control. It should be noted that ECG 
monitoring in Study C2305 and C2402 included an ECG assessment 20 days after pasireotide LAR injection (i.e. 
time of maximum plasma concentration of pasireotide) to ensure that the maximal potential effect of pasireotide 
on cardiac conduction intervals was captured.  
In Study C2305, QT-prolongation-related AEs were reported in 9.0% vs. 7.2% of patients on pasireotide LAR vs. 
octreotide  LAR  (Table  35).  In  Study  C2402,  no  such  events  were  reported,  whereas  in  Study  C2305  after 
crossover the incidence was 4.9% after crossover to pasireotide LAR and 0% after crossover to octreotide LAR 
(Table 36). Most of the events were grade 1-2, and led to discontinuation for one patient (a medically naïve 
patient with a grade 3 event on octreotide LAR in Study C2305). 
There was no indication of an increased incidence in QT prolongation-related events with longer treatment (>1 
year), either in Study C2305 or C2110/E. 
Bradycardia 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 100/122 
  
  
Bradycardia has been observed in human studies with pasireotide as well as octreotide and lanreotide, and is a 
recognized class effect of SSAs in humans. In medically naïve patients in Study C2305, a decrease in mean heart 
rate was seen based on ECG recordings within the first month of treatment, with mean values subsequently 
stabilizing at a rate approximately 10 bpm lower than at baseline on both pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR. No 
such trend for heart rate was seen in Study C2402. 
In Study C2305, the incidence of bradycardia (including the preferred terms bradycardia and sinus bradycardia) 
was 10.7% vs. 7.2% on pasireotide LAR vs. octreotide LAR; 9.0% vs. 5.6% of patients had events that were 
considered study drug related. In Study C2402, 1.6% of patients in each pasireotide LAR arm had such an event 
(none on active control), with no events considered related to study drug.  
There  was  no  indication  of  an  increased  incidence  in  bradycardia-related  events  with  longer  treatment  (>1 
year), either in Study C2305 or C2110/E. All events were grade 1-2. 
Liver safety 
Elevations  in  transaminases  and  cholelithiasis  are  known  to  occur  with  SSA  treatment.  A  comprehensive 
analysis of liver safety was conducted across the pasireotide development program for studies in which the sc 
formulation was used. This included more than 650 healthy volunteers and more than 300 patients (acromegaly, 
Cushing's  disease  and  carcinoid  disease)  in  clinical  studies  and  compassionate  use  programs.  The  analyses 
included  laboratory  results,  AE  reporting  in  clinical  studies  and  in  the  Novartis  ARGUS  safety  database,  a 
literature review, and Modeling and Simulation analyses. 
In the pasireotide development program 4 cases were identified with biochemical findings consistent with "Hy’s 
Law", i.e. ALT/AST >3xULN, TB  ≥ 2xULN, and ALP  <2xULN, however, the temporal  relationship (moderate, 
almost synchronous elevation of ALT/AST and TB with rapid normalization post discontinuation) is not consistent 
with the typical pattern (very high ALT/AST, followed by persistent TB elevations) of severe drug induced liver 
injury. Three of these cases occurred in healthy volunteers, none of which was symptomatic, and all resolved. 
The fourth case, a patient in a compassionate use program, was more consistent with hepatitis than obstruction. 
No cases meeting the biochemical criteria for Hy’s law have been observed with pasireotide LAR.  
Liver safety in patients with acromegaly 
In Study C2305 and C2402, liver safety-related AEs (predominantly increases in AST and/or ALT) were seen in 
around 10% of medically naive patients and in <6.2% of inadequately controlled patients, with comparable 
incidences on pasireotide LAR and active controls. The majority of events were grade 1-2 and resolved without 
intervention;  2  patients  discontinued  (both  from  Study  C2305)  due  to  elevation  in  transaminases.  The 
elevations resolved for both patients after pasireotide LAR was discontinued. 
No liver safety-related AEs were reported in Study C2110/E.  
In medically naïve patients the incidence of abnormal serum transaminase values (ALT or AST >3xULN) was 
comparable on pasireotide LAR (5.1%) and octreotide LAR (3.3%). Among inadequately controlled patients one 
single  patient  in  Study  C2402  (a  patient  on  pasireotide  LAR  40  mg)  had  ALT  >5xULN;  this  resolved  after 
temporarily interrupting study drug. No such abnormalities were reported in Study C2305 after crossover. In 
Study C2110 no cases were reported in the core phase with pasireotide LAR treatment; one case during the 
extension resolved without intervention. There were no patients with biochemical findings compatible with Hy's 
law in Studies C2305, C2402 or C2110/E.

Gallbladder and related events 
Somatostatin is known to decrease bile secretion and bile flow as a result of inhibition of biliary flow. Preclinical 
studies  with  pasireotide  did  not  show  any  evidence  of  cholelithiasis  in  monkeys  or  mice,  and  no  signs  of 
cholestasis in rats. However, cholelithiasis is commonly reported in human studies with pasireotide as well as 
octreotide with long-term treatment. In the pasireotide development program, regular gallbladder ultrasound 
assessments are implemented to closely monitor the occurrence of gallbladder abnormalities.  
Gallstones  or  sludge  were  frequently  observed  by  gallbladder  ultrasonography  both  on  pasireotide  LAR  and 
active control. In Study C2305, a new or worsened abnormality was seen in approximately a third of patients on 
both pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR. Similarly, in Study C2110E, approximately one-third of patients had a 
gallbladder result that was new or worsened from baseline. The proportion of patients with such abnormalities 
was lower in Study C2402 (15%-20% on all treatments), which may be expected due to the shorter follow-up 
in this study (6 months, compared to 12 or more months in studies C2305 and C2110E). 
Data  from  studies  C2305,  C2402  and  C2110E  show  that  the  frequency  of  cholelithiasis  is  comparable  on 
pasireotide LAR and active control, and that the incidence increases over time. In Study C2305 cholelithiasis was 
seen in 30-40% of medically naïve patients; in Study C2402 the incidence was lower at 10%-14%, as expected 
due to the shorter follow-up. While cholelithiasis was asymptomatic in most patients, an increase in the number 
of patients who underwent cholecystectomy after a year of treatment was seen in Study C2305. The emerging 
long-term data indicates that as for other SSAs, the incidence of cholelithiasis, and the number of patients who 
require surgery, increases over time. 
Pituitary hormone function 
As somatostatin suppresses the secretion of pituitary hormones, patients with acromegaly that are treated with 
SSAs may experience deficiencies in one or more pituitary hormones. Furthermore, patients may have impaired 
pituitary function at baseline due to prior pituitary surgery or radiation therapy.  
ACTH and hypocortisolism 
There  was  no  relevant  difference  in  ACTH  or  cortisol  levels  between  pasireotide  LAR  and  active  controls  in 
Studies C2305 and C2402, and no clinically relevant reductions in ACTH or cortisol were seen in these studies or 
in Study C2110E. 
Few  patients  had  hypocortisolism-related  AEs.  In  medically  naïve  patients  in  Study  C2305,  such  AEs  were 
reported (pasireotide LAR vs. octreotide LAR) in 3.4% vs. 2.8% of patients. In addition, hypocortisolism was 
reported as an AE in 2 inadequately controlled patients receiving pasireotide LAR (one in Study C2402 and one 
in Study C2305 after crossover). Most events were grade 1-2, however 2 medically naïve patients had grade 3-4 
events (one on pasireotide LAR and one on octreotide LAR). Some of these patients had abnormal ACTH or 
cortisol values at baseline (including one patient with Cushing's syndrome and elevated ACTH at baseline). All 
cases resolved, some of them in response to concomitant therapy. No hypocortisolism-related AEs were seen in 
Study C2110 or Study B2201. 
Hypothyroidism 
There  was  no  relevant  difference  in  TSH  and  free  T4  levels  between  pasireotide  LAR  and  active  controls  in 
Studies C2305 and C2402, and no clinically relevant changes in hormone levels were seen in these studies. 
Hypothyroidism-related  AEs  were  reported  in  <10%  of  patients  in  Study  C2305,  with  similar  incidences  for 
pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR (<10% of patients); none of the AEs were grade 3-4. No AEs related to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 102/122 
  
  
abnormal  thyroid  function  were  reported  in  Study  C2402 or  Study  C2110/E;  in  Study  B2201/E  one  case  of 
hypothyroidism and one case of hyperthyroidism was reported. 
Safety in special populations 
Special populations 
The inclusion criteria in all studies in the pasireotide clinical development program specify a minimum age of at 
least 18 years. Patients with acromegaly due to other causes than a pituitary adenoma were also excluded, and 
these criteria are in line with the proposed label. To ensure patient safety, patients with certain co-morbidities 
were excluded from clinical studies, and these are appropriately reflected in the proposed label. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Clinical studies have not been performed in patients with impaired renal function. Renal clearance of pasireotide 
represents a small fraction (~14%) of its total elimination from  the body; this was verified by results from 
pasireotide sc (Study B2112) and supported by similar findings from animal studies. A common dose for the 
different subgroups of renally impaired patients is suggested. 
No specific safety analysis with respect to renal function was presented. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Pasireotide is eliminated mainly via hepatic clearance. The results from the hepatic impairment study (Study 
B2114) with pasireotide sc were used for bridging to the LAR formulation. These results indicate that no dose 
adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment. The maximum dose for patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment is 40 mg every 28 days with a starting dose of 20 mg.  
Elevations  of  liver  enzymes  and  TB  were  observed  in  pasireotide  sc  studies.  As  a  precautionary  measure, 
patients with acromegaly and severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with pasireotide LAR. 
Sub-groups of the study population 
In  Study  C2305  AEs  and  shifts  in  FPG/HbA1c  ADA  categories  were  evaluated  according  to  demographic 
subgroups of gender, race (Caucasian, Asian, other), and age group (<65 years and ≥ 65 years).  
An  overview  of  AEs  by  demographic  subgroups  is  presented  in  Table  37.  No  marked  differences  were  seen 
between  subgroups  in  terms  of  overall  severity  of  AEs,  or  discontinuations  due  to  AEs,  in  these  analyses. 
Evaluation of shifts in FPG/HbA1c or incidences in individual preferred terms revealed no major differences for 
race or age group.  
Based on population mixed-effect modelling, gender was found to be a significant covariate for steady-state 
trough concentrations of pasireotide LAR, with female patients having approximately 30% higher pasireotide 
concentrations than male patients after adjusting for bodyweight and GGT level. Whether this translates into a 
higher safety risk for females than males is uncertain, as the 30% difference in concentrations lies within inter- 
and intra-patient PK variability. Evaluating gender differences for special safety risks could not lead to a firm 
conclusion because the studies were not powered to demonstrate such gender differences; however females 
may be at a slightly higher risk of developing hyperglycaemia than males, as highlighted from the PK-pop further 
analysis.

Immunological events 
Anti-pasireotide antibodies were detected in rat studies. However, based on the sustained pharmacologic effects 
observed, these antibodies do not appear to have a neutralizing effect on pasireotide. 
No clinical samples have been collected to evaluate immunogenicity of pasireotide. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Pasireotide has moderate protein binding and is metabolically highly stable.  
The potential for drug to drug interaction (DDI) of pasireotide and P-gp inhibitors has been tested in healthy 
male subjects in Study B2127. The purpose of the study was to investigate the potential drug-drug interaction

when pasireotide sc is used in combination with oral verapamil, a known P-gp inhibitor. There was no change in 
the rate or extent of pasireotide availability with co-administration of verapamil. No new safety concerns were 
identified  during  the  study  when  pasireotide  sc  was  administered  alone  or  in  combination  with  verapamil 
sustained release. 
In addition, based on in vitro studies at therapeutic dose levels, pasireotide is not expected to be: 
•  a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of CYP450 (cytochrome P450); 
•  a substrate of the efflux transporter BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) nor of the influx transporters 
OCT1 (organic cation transporter 1) and OATP (organic anion-transporting polypeptide) 1B1, 1B3 or 2B1; 
•  an inhibitor of UGT1A1 (uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1), influx transporter OATP 1B1 or 
1B3,  OAT1  or  OAT3  (organic  anion  transporter),  OCT1  or  OCT2,  efflux  transporter  P-gp,  BCRP,  MRP2 
(multi-drug resistance protein 2) or BSEP (bile salt export pump). 
Based on all these in vitro data, the potential for protein binding, metabolism and/or transporter mediated DDI 
is low between pasireotide and co-medications in vivo. 
Caution is required when co-administering pasireotide LAR with anti-arrhythmic medicines and other drugs that 
may prolong the QT interval. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The discontinuation rate in medically naïve patients was slightly higher in the pasireotide LAR group (9.0%) than 
the octreotide LAR group (5.0%: Table 35). The difference is primarily due to hyperglycaemia-related events (6 
patients [3.4%] on pasireotide LAR (5 with grade 3-4 AE) and 3 patients [1.7%] on octreotide LAR (1 with a 
grade 3-4 AE)), and AEs related to liver safety (2 patients [1.1%] on pasireotide LAR (both grade 1-2 AEs), none 
on octreotide LAR. Two of the patients who discontinued due to a hyperglycaemia-related event had a grade 4 
event; these were also SAEs. 
In inadequately controlled patients, AEs leading to discontinuation only occurred on pasireotide LAR treatment 
(Table 36). In Study C2402, 6 of the 7 patients who discontinued did so due to a hyperglycaemia-related event. 
None of these  events were serious, and  all  were grade  2  or 3.  The seventh  patient  discontinued due to an 
unrelated event of colon cancer. In Study C2305, 16.0% of patients who crossed to pasireotide LAR discontinued 
treatment; all except one case was due to hyperglycaemia-related AEs.. None of the patients who crossed to 
octreotide LAR discontinued due to AE.  
AEs leading to discontinuation in the supportive acromegaly studies were rare and consistent with those seen in 
the Phase 3 studies, and included discontinuations due to hyperglycaemia-related events. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile is mainly based on two studies including a total of 556 patients of which 241 have been treated 
with pasireotide LAR. Data for up to 2 years of treatment has been provided for 55 patients. Considering that 
acromegaly is a rare disease, the safety population is considered sufficient both with regards to the number of 
subjects exposed and the duration of exposure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 105/122 
  
  
 
The safety profile of pasireotide appears comparable to that of octreotide. However, hyperglycaemia related 
events occurred with higher frequency in the pasireotide treated group. In addition, more high-grade events 
were observed with pasireotide, again mainly hyperglycaemia related events. 
Apart from hyperglycaemia AEs, no gross differences were observed in the pasireotide safety profile between 
medically  naïve  patients  and  patients  inadequately  controlled  with  regards  to  common  adverse  events. 
High-grade hyperglycaemia related events were more common in the pasireotide treated groups also in this 
population. Some AEs occurred at a lower frequency in the population experienced with somatostatin analogue 
treatment,  i.e.  alopecia.  However,  although  frequencies  may  differ  somewhat  between  experienced  and 
medically naïve populations there appears to be no qualitative differences between groups.  
All AEs reported in the pasireotide sc studies and HV studies were as expected. No new safety concerns arise 
from this reporting.  
With the exception of hyperglycaemia related events which were much more common in the medically naïve 
pasireotide  treated  group  and  a  slightly  lower  reporting  of  gastrointestinal  and  hepatobiliary  events  in  the 
pasireotide treated group; the reporting of drug-related AEs was very similar in the two groups. As in medically 
naïve patients, hyperglycaemia related events were more common in the inadequately controlled patients on 
pasireotide. In contrast to the observation in the medically naïve patients, an increased reporting of GI events 
was observed in these patients indicating a somewhat different effect of pasireotide in patients already shown 
tolerant to other somatostatin analogues.  
Considering that there appear to be no qualitative differences  between the  AEs reported by experienced or 
medically naïve patients, a pooled analysis of all common adverse events  and drug related events for studies 
C2305 and C2402 was provided. This analysis is the basis for the presentation of the AEs in the SmPC. 
SAEs were rather few also in the long-term study. The predominant SAEs in both groups (medically naïve and 
inadequately controlled) were related to gallbladder function and hyperglycaemia. No new safety concerns arise.  
None of the four deaths were assessed as related to study medication. This is endorsed. 
With regards to adverse events of special interest, no gross differences were observed between pasireotide and 
octreotide  treatments,  except  for  hyperglycaemia  and  diabetes.  The  frequencies  differed  slightly  between 
medically  naïve  patients  and  those  experienced  with  somatostatin  analogue  treatment.  This  may  reflect  a 
selection of patients in the experienced population as well as the fact that some AEs become less common with 
prolonged treatment. 
Concerning laboratory findings, slight decreases in hemoglobin and WBC were observed in the studies. This is in 
line with the known pharmacodynamic effects of somatostatin and its analogues. Most of the events were of 
grade 1-2. No changes in coagulation parameters were observed; however, patients with known coagulation 
abnormalities  were  excluded  from  the  studies  due  to  a  weak  signal  in  the  non-clinical  studies.  A  warning 
regarding  this  lack  of  information  has  been  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  taking  into  account  that 
pasireotide LAR is administered as a deep intramuscular injection. 
The  most  prominent  findings  with  regards  to  clinical  chemistry  were  hyperglycaemia  and  increases  in 
transaminases.  High  grade  hyperglycaemia  events  were  frequently  observed  and  more  common  than  with 
octreotide. Increases in liver tests were usually grade 1-2 and no cases fulfilling Hy’s law were observed. As 
expected, no clinically relevant observations were made with regards to urinary analyses. 
With regards  to  vital signs, Bradycardia was  commonly  observed in  both  pasireotide and octreotide treated 
patients in line with the known effect of somatostatin analogues. Weight decrease was more common in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 106/122 
  
  
pasireotide treated groups. The Applicant proposes that this may be due to the decrease in IGF-1 levels but an 
effect of gastrointestinal adverse events cannot be excluded. 
An analysis of adverse events of special interest was provided. Hyperglycaemia related AEs were clearly more 
common and more severe in patients treated with pasireotide compared to active comparators. The frequency 
and severity was related to the degree of metabolic impairment at baseline. Most of the events occurred within 
3 months after initiation of therapy. When FPG and HbA1c was analysed over time there was a rather steep 
increase in both parameters over the first three months after which values slowly decreased although stayed 
well above the baseline level. The decrease is assumed to reflect the response to anti-diabetic treatment. This 
was confirmed by further analyses of patients in whom anti-diabetic treatment was started. The proportion of 
patients without anti diabetic treatment at baseline and who started such treatment during the study was 36% 
with pasireotide LAR and 4.4% with octreotide LAR. 
With  the  responses  to  the  Day  120  LoQ,  the  Applicant  has  provided  an  analysis  of  the  different  types  of 
anti-diabetic  treatments  used  at  baseline  and  during  the  study.  Although  the  data  presented  should  be 
interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  low  numbers  it  shows  that  standard  oral  anti-diabetic  treatment  was 
sufficient to control the pasireotide-induced hyperglycaemia and  rather few  patients were in need of insulin 
treatment. The recommendations given in the SmPC are supported by the data provided.  
Cross-over  data  from  the  extension  show  that  the  hyperglycaemia  is  reversible.  Hyperglycaemia  was  less 
prominent in responders. This may be explained by the fact that lowering of GH levels may decrease insulin 
resistance. When results were analysed by diabetic status, a somewhat lower response was observed in patients 
with diabetes compared to patients with normal glucose tolerance at baseline, however this effect did not differ 
between treatment groups. The risk of hyperglycaemia and recommendations on monitoring and treatment are 
included in the SmPC. Further to this, as recommended during the assessment of the MAA for the sc formulation, 
a  study  with  the  aim  of  investigating  the  treatment  of  pasireotide-induced  hyperglycaemia  in  patients  with 
Cushing’s  disease  or  acromegaly  is  planned.  The  final  results  are  expected  to  be  available  in  Q2  of  2018. 
Considering  that  study  C2305  and  C2402  has  provided  reassuring  data  showing  that  pasireotide-induced 
hyperglycaemia  may  be  adequately  handled  applying  standard  diabetes  treatment  algorithms,  this  is 
acceptable. The study has been included in the RMP. 
Of note, even in diabetic patients on anti-diabetic treatments, long-term microvascular complications, such as 
diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy and macrovascular complications cannot be excluded. These 
complications represent major causes of morbidity and mortality for patients. 
A slight trend towards a higher reporting of QT-prolongation-related AEs in the pasireotide treated groups was 
observed. No arrhythmia events reported. The risk of QT-prolongation is reflected in the SmPC. A slightly higher 
reporting of bradycardia was also observed in pasireotide treated patients. The risk of bradycardia is reflected in 
the SmPC. This risk is included as an identified risk in the RMP.  
Concerning liver safety, cases fulfilling Hy’s law have been reported in the pasireotide development program; 
however no cases have been reported for pasireotide LAR. In studies 2305 and 2402 elevations of liver enzymes 
were reported in < 10 % of patients and most events were of grade 1-2; however 2 patients discontinued due 
to elevation of transaminases. The risk of elevated liver tests is reflected in the SmPC. 
Formation of gallstones or sludge is a well-known AE occurring with somatostatin analogue treatment. 
Gallbladder related events occurred at comparable frequencies for both pasireotide and octreotide. The SmPC 
contains recommendations on monitoring of gallbladder related events. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 107/122 
  
  
Although no relevant ACTH or cortisol suppression was noted in the pasireotide LAR program, hypocortisolism 
related events were reported. Both grade 1-2 and grade 3-4 events were reported. In some of the cases specific 
therapy was needed. Warnings regarding the risk of hypocortisolism and recommendations on monitoring are 
included in the SmPC.  
Although no clinically relevant changes in TSH and free T4 levels were observed in the studies, hypothyroidism 
related events were reported in < 10 % of patients in both treatment groups. Warnings and recommendations 
on monitoring are included in the SmPC. 
No studies have been conducted in special populations; instead treatment recommendations are based on PK 
data. Considering that acromegaly is a rare disease, this is acceptable.  
Regarding hepatic impairment, elevations of liver enzymes and TB were observed in pasireotide sc studies. As 
a precautionary measure, patients with acromegaly and severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with 
pasireotide LAR. Based on pharmacokinetic data from the hepatic impairment study (Study B2114) with 
pasireotide sc, doses for mild and moderate hepatic impairment was established. No dose adjustment is needed 
for patients with mild hepatic impairment and the maximum dose for patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
is 40 mg every 28 days, with a starting dose of 20 mg. The applicant´s bridging of PK data from pasireotide sc 
to the LAR formulation is acceptable. 
Given the elevations of liver enzymes associated with pasireotide and as efficacy and safety data in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment treated with 20 mg of pasireotide LAR are lacking, it is recommended that the use 
of the proposed dose (20 mg pasireotide LAR) in patients with hepatic impairment is included as part of the 
missing information “Patients with liver disease” in the RMP and consequently monitored within future PSURs. 
A clinical study in subjects with impaired renal function is ongoing. As renal clearance of pasireotide represents 
a  small  fraction  (~14%)  of  its  total  elimination  from  the  body,  mild  and  moderate  renal  impairment  is  not 
expected  to  significantly  impact  the  circulating  levels  of  pasireotide.  It  cannot  be  excluded  that  systemic 
exposure is increased in severe renal impairment. A dedicated study (B2126) in patients with renal impairment 
(mild, moderate, severe and end stage renal disease) is ongoing. 
Subgroup analysis of the AE pattern due to gender, age or ethnicity did not reveal any relevant differences. 
Grade 4 AEs were more common in patients above the age of 65, however the number of patients was very low 
and therefore no firm conclusions can be drawn. Exposure is higher in females than males and this is highlighted 
in SmPC section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties, sub section Special population.  
No analysis on immunological events or research on antigenicity has been conducted in humans. However, no 
hypersensitivity reactions were reported in the studies and injection site reactions were reported in about 8 % 
of medically naïve subjects and in < 3 % of experienced patients. This reporting rate is lower than for the sc 
formulation. Allergic reactions/immunogenicity is included as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
No  new  safety  concerns  regarding  drug-interactions  arise  from  the  newly  submitted  data.  The  potential 
drug-drug interactions are adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Discontinuations due to AEs were higher in the pasireotide treated groups and the predominant AE leading to 
discontinuation was hyperglycaemia. 
The safety data submitted with the PSURs for Signifor in the Cushing disease (sc administration schema) has not 
revealed any new safety concerns. As pointed out, post-marketing experience is still very limited. 
In the clinical studies, long-acting pasireotide as well as long-acting octreotide was introduced in medically naïve 
patients without testing the patient’s tolerance to somatostatin analogues. Considering the low drop-out rates  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 108/122 
  
  
this strategy appeared feasible. Data presented from studies with both short-acting pasireotide and short-acting 
octreotide  support  that  starting  with  a  short-acting  agent  can  neither  alleviate  gastrointestinal  nor 
hyperglycaemic adverse events 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
With  the  exception  of  hyperglycaemia  which  was  more  common  in  the  pasireotide  LAR  treated  groups  and 
occurred  with  higher  severity,  but  can  be  managed  with  glucose-lowering  therapy,  the  safety  profile  is 
comparable to that of octreotide and lanreotide.  The overall safety profile was therefore found to be acceptable 
by CHMP. . 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by  the applicant fulfils the legislative 
requirements. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.1 is acceptable. In addition, minor revisions were 
recommended  to  be  taken  into  account  with  the  next  RMP  update.  The  PRAC  endorsed  PRAC  Rapporteur 
assessment report is attached. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice with one minor change: 
It  is  recommended  that  the  use  of  the  proposed  dose  (20  mg  pasireotide  LAR)  in  patients  with  hepatic 
impairment  is  included  as  part  of  the  missing  information  “Patients  with  liver  disease”  in  the  RMP  and 
consequently monitored within future PSURs. Such revision can be submitted with the next update of the RMP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits  
This application concerns a long-acting formulation of pasireotide (Signifor) intended for the treatment of 
patients with acromegaly. The treatment is to be administered as monthly intramuscular injections. A 
short-acting formulation of pasireotide (Signifor) for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s disease was 
approved in April 2012. 
Beneficial effects 
The  effect  of  pasireotide  has  been  evaluated  in  two  large  and  well-conducted  clinical  trials.  The  studies 
investigated two different populations. In the largest study (2305), which included 358 patients, the effect of 
pasireotide LAR was compared to the effect of octreotide LAR in medically naïve patients. Both patients who had 
undergone  surgery  (42  %)  and  de  novo  patients  were  included.  Data  up  to 2  years  of  treatment  has been 
provided. The smaller study (2402) included 198 patients inadequately controlled on maximal doses of either 
octreotide LAR or lanreotide ATG. This study investigated two different doses of pasireotide LAR, 40 mg and 60 
mg once monthly. 
In  medically  naïve  patients,  superiority  of  pasireotide  LAR  to  octreotide  LAR  was  investigated.  The  primary 
endpoint was response to therapy with responders having to achieve lowering of both GH and IGF-1. The study 
met its primary endpoint showing that the number of responders with pasireotide LAR (31 %) was significantly 
higher than for octreotide LAR (19 %; OR 1.94 (1.19, 3.17)). The primary analysis was consistently supported 
by  the  sensitivity  analyses  performed,  thus  the  data  appear  robust.  Response  rates  in  patients  that  had 
undergone surgery were higher for both treatments and the overall outcome was mainly driven by this group. A 
slightly higher proportion in the pasireotide treated group “over-responded”, i.e. GH decreased to <2.5 µg/L and 
IGF-1 <LLN. 
The proportion of patients with GH response did not differ between treatment groups at Month 12 (48 % vs 52 
% for pasireotide and octreotide respectively). The difference in GH response was less prominent between post 
surgery and de novo patients. As shown by the separate analyses for GH and IGF-1 response, the outcome of 
the primary endpoint was mainly driven by a higher response with regards to IGF-1 with pasireotide LAR (39 %) 
compared  to  octreotide  LAR  (24  %).  The  difference  in  IGF-1  response  was  more  prominent  between  post 
surgery and de novo patients.  
Data from  the extension  phase  show that the rate  of responders decreased somewhat over time, however, 
responder  rates  were  consistently  higher  in  the  pasireotide  treated  group  (24  %  vs  14  %  at  Month  25  for 
pasireotide and octreotide respectively; OR 2.1 (1.14, 3.7)). 
Symptoms  of  acromegaly  improved  in  both  treatment  groups  with  no  significant  differences  observed. 
Improvements with regards to Quality of Life were observed in both groups. 
In patients inadequately controlled on other somatostatin analogues, 6 months treatment with pasireotide LAR 
resulted in 15.4 % and 20 % responders with the 40 mg and 60 mg dose respectively, whereas no responders 
were  observed  in  the  active  control  group.  Thus  the  study  met  its  primary  endpoint  and  the  outcome  was 
confirmed by the sensitivity analyses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 116/122 
  
  
The proportion of patients with normalised IGF-1 was significantly higher in the pasireotide treated groups with 
a less pronounced difference between the two doses (26 % vs 25 % for the 40 mg and 60 mg dose groups 
respectively). No responders were observed in the control group.  
The proportion of patients responding with regards to GH was significantly higher for both doses of pasireotide 
(35 % vs 43 % for the 40 mg and 60 mg dose groups respectively) compared to active control (13 %). A dose 
response effect was observed with a higher response rate in the pasireotide 60 mg group. 
The outcome in patients that crossed-over from octreotide to pasireotide and vice versa in study 2305 was also 
provided.  This  dataset  provides  supportive  data  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  with  octreotide  LAR  or 
pasireotide  LAR.  Notably,  a  larger  proportion  of  patients  responded  in  the  group  that  crossed-over  from 
octreotide to pasireotide (17 %) than in the group that crossed over from pasireotide, where no responders were 
observed after 12 months of treatment. 
Both studies investigated the effect of pasireotide LAR on tumour size as part of the secondary endpoints. In 
medically naïve patients, both treatments showed comparable effects on tumour volume with a mean percent 
reduction of 38-39.7 %. The proportion of patients that achieved at least 20 % reduction was also comparable 
between treatments (75 % for pasireotide LAR vs. 72 % for octreotide LAR). In patients inadequately controlled, 
a reduction in tumour volume was observed in all treatment groups with no apparent difference between the two 
doses of pasireotide. A difference between pasireotide group and control group was however observed. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
A  new cut-off limit of GH  to assess the efficacy of  a treatment in acromegaly  has been defined in  a recent 
consensus paper (Giustina 2010) after the pivotal studies with pasireotide were initiated. Based on this new 
definition, a response was associated with “reduction of GH levels < 1 μg/L and normalization of IGF-1 levels”, 
instead of “reduction of GH levels < 2.5 ug/L and  normalisation of IGF-1“. Further to the day 120 LoQ, the 
Applicant provided post-hoc analysis regarding proportion of responders taking into account this “new” cut-off 
level. Results have to be interpreted with caution (post-hoc approach). A trend to a better efficacy of pasireotide 
LAR in uncontrolled patients was revealed from these results.  
The long-term effect of treatment in patients inadequately controlled on other somatostatin analogues is still 
lacking. This far, only interim 12 month data from extension phase of study C2402 has been provided. These 
results, however, indicate that the effect of pasireotide is maintained over time also in this population. 
Although not formally investigated in the pivotal studies, relevant and sufficient data have been presented to 
support the use of the 20 mg dose in patients over-responding to the 40 mg dose, as well as temporarily for 
tolerability reasons. Adequate recommendations on the use of the 20 mg dose are given in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile is mainly based on two studies including a total of 556 patients of which 241 have been treated 
with pasireotide LAR. Data for up to 2 years of treatment has been provided for 55 patients. Considering that 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/524716/2014 
Page 117/122 
  
  
 
acromegaly  is  a  rare  disease,  the  safety  population  is  considered  sufficient  with  regards  to  the  number  of 
subjects  exposed.  Furthermore,  there  is  long  experience  with  other  somatostatin  analogues.  With  this 
submission,  comparative  data  has  become  available  and  the  safety  profile  of  pasireotide  was  compared  to 
alternative treatments  (octreotide  and  lanreotide).  More  high-grade  events  were  observed  with  pasireotide, 
mainly hyperglycaemia related events. 
No  gross  differences  were  observed  in  the  pasireotide  safety  profile  between  medically  naïve  patients  and 
patients inadequately controlled with regards to common adverse events. The only relevant difference between 
medically  naïve  patients  and  patients  experienced  with  treatment  was  a  lower  reporting  of  drug-related 
gastrointestinal  events  in  the  medically  naïve  patients  compared  to  octreotide  LAR  whereas  an  increased 
reporting of GI events was observed in treatment experienced patients when switching to pasireotide, indicating 
a somewhat different effect of pasireotide in patients already shown tolerant to other somatostatin analogues.  
SAEs  were  rather  few  also  in  the  long-term  study  (20  %  in  the  pasireotide  treated  group  and  15  % in  the 
octreotide treated group, medically naïve patients). The predominant SAEs in both groups (medically naïve and 
inadequately  controlled)  were  related  to  gallbladder  function  and  hyperglycaemia.  None  of  the  four  deaths 
reported from the clinical trials were assessed as related to study medication. This is endorsed. 
Concerning laboratory findings, slight decreases in haemoglobin and WBC were observed in the studies. Most of 
the  events  were  of  grade  1-2.  The  most  prominent  findings  with  regards  to  clinical  chemistry  were 
hyperglycaemia and increases in transaminases. High grade hyperglycaemia events were frequently observed 
and more common with pasireotide LAR than with octreotide LAR. Increases in liver tests were usually grade 1-2 
and no cases fulfilling Hy’s law were observed. As expected, no clinically relevant observations were made with 
regards to urinary analyses. 
With regards to vital signs, bradycardia was commonly observed in both pasireotide (11 %) and octreotide (7 
%)  treated  patients  in  line  with  the  known  effect  of  somatostatin  analogues.  Weight  decrease  was  more 
common in the pasireotide treated groups. 
The following adverse events of special interest were analysed – hyperglycaemia, QT-prolongation, liver safety 
including  the  formation  of  gallstones,  effects  on  other  pituitary  hormones  (i.e.  ACTH,  TSH).  Except  for 
hyperglycaemia,  the  reporting  rates  for  these  events  with  pasireotide  LAR  did  not  show  any  meaningful 
difference compared to octreotide LAR. Warnings and recommendations on monitoring of these events have 
been included in relevant sections in the SmPC. These recommendations are acceptable. 
With the new comparative data provided with this application it is clear that pasireotide has a higher potential for 
inducing hyperglycaemia than octreotide. Hyperglycaemia related AEs were clearly more common and more 
severe in patients treated with pasireotide (64 %) compared to octreotide (25 %). The frequency and severity 
was related to the degree of metabolic impairment at baseline. Most of the events occurred within 3 months 
after initiation of therapy. When FPG and HbA1c was analysed over time there was a rather steep increase in 
both parameters over the first three months after  which values slowly  decreased although they stayed well 
above the baseline level. Analyses of patients in whom anti-diabetic treatment was started showed that these 
patients adequately responded to the anti-diabetic therapy. 
Importantly,  the  proportion  of  patients  without  anti-diabetic  treatment  at  baseline  and  who  started  such 
treatment during the study was 36% with pasireotide LAR and 4.4% with octreotide LAR. 
No analysis on immunological events or research on antigenicity has been conducted in humans. However, no 
hypersensitivity reactions were reported in the studies and injection site reactions were reported in about 8 %

of medically naïve subjects and in < 3 % of experienced patients. This reporting rate is lower than for the sc 
formulation. 
All important safety issues identified are addressed in relevant sections of the SmPC, and these issues are also 
already included in the pasireotide RMP. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Hyperglycaemia:  AEs  related  to  hyperglycaemia  tended  to  occur  in  particular  during  the  first  3  months  of 
treatment with pasireotide, with attenuation or stabilization of the effect over time.  However, it is not clear 
whether this attenuation is related to the use/adjustment of anti-diabetic medication or to the attenuation of the 
pasireotide effect on glucose metabolism. Of note the management of patients for hypoglycaemia in the clinical 
studies was not harmonised across all the sites/countries.  
Also, the incidence of SAE related to hyperglycaemia was limited in the clinical studies with pasireotide. This can 
be related to the relatively small population size of patients in the phase 3 clinical studies. Taking into account 
that patients with acromegaly are likely to have comorbidities, in particular glucose metabolic disorders then 
worsening  of  their  glycaemic  parameters  with  pasireotide  is  expected.  Therefore,  the  occurrence  of  serious 
events such as ketoacidosis or diabetic hyperglycaemic coma cannot be excluded. 
There is still insufficient data on how to best treat pasireotide-induced hyperglycaemia. Data presented shows 
that standard oral anti-diabetic treatment was sufficient to control the pasireotide-induced hyperglycaemia and 
rather few patients were in need of insulin treatment. The recommendations given in the SmPC are supported 
by  the  data  provided.  Considering  that  study  2305  and  2402  has  provided  reassuring  data  showing  that 
pasireotide-induced  hyperglycaemia  may  be  adequately  handled  applying  standard  diabetes  treatment 
algorithms, this is acceptable. The planned study to investigate this issue has been included in the RMP.  
Of note, even in diabetic patients on anti-diabetic treatments, long-term microvascular complications, such as 
diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy and macrovascular complications cannot be excluded. These 
complications represent major causes of morbidity and mortality for patients. 
Liver  safety:  Elevations  of  liver  enzymes  were  associated  with  SSA  treatments  and  such  elevations  were 
observed with pasireotide. As a precautionary measure, pasireotide is therefore contraindicated in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment.  
Based on pharmacokinetic data from the hepatic impairment study (Study B2114) with pasireotide sc, doses for 
mild and moderate hepatic impairment was established. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild 
hepatic impairment and the maximum dose for patients with moderate hepatic impairment is 40 mg every 28 
days, with a starting dose of 20 mg.  
Given the elevations of liver enzymes associated with pasireotide and as efficacy and safety data in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment treated with 20 mg of pasireotide LAR are lacking, it is recommended that the use 
of the proposed dose (20 mg pasireotide LAR) in patients with hepatic impairment is included as  part of the 
missing information “Patients with liver disease” in the RMP and consequently monitored within future PSURs. 
Renal impairment: Clinical studies have not been performed in patients with impaired renal function. As renal 
clearance of pasireotide  represents a small fraction (~14%) of its total elimination from the body, mild and 
moderate renal impairment is not expected to significantly impact the circulating levels of pasireotide. It cannot 
be  excluded  that  systemic  exposure  is  increased  in  severe  renal  impairment.  A  dedicated  study  (B2126)  in 
patients with renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe and end stage renal disease) is ongoing.

In the clinical studies, long-acting pasireotide as well as long-acting octreotide was introduced in medically naïve 
patients without testing the patient’s tolerance to somatostatin analogues. Considering the low discontinuation 
rates due to AEs (9 % vs 5 % in pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR treated subjects respectively), this strategy 
appears feasible. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Although transphenoidal surgery is the most frequently recommended treatment in acromegaly, there is a need 
for medical treatment in patients where surgery has failed or when surgery is not an option.  
The primary endpoint (percentage of responders defined as a reduction of GH level to < 2.5 μg/L and normalized 
IGF-1) was met in study C2305 and study C2402, thus pasireotide has been shown to be superior compared to 
octreotide. However, this superiority was  obtained with the “old” cut-off of GH<2.5µg/l and this cut-off was 
revised by the Acromegaly Consensus Group to GH<1µg/l after the pivotal studies were initiated.  
In  medically  naïve  patients,  no  difference  between  treatments  was  observed  with  regards  to  the  effect  on 
tumour size reduction whereas a difference was observed in uncontrolled patients. However, the finding that a 
proportion of patients experienced an increase in tumour size (with all treatments) emphasizes the need for 
continuous monitoring. 
The safety profile of pasireotide is generally comparable to that known for other somatostatin analogues with 
the  exception  of  a  greater  risk  for  hyperglycaemia.  Although  manageable  with  appropriate  treatments  and 
reversible after treatment discontinuation, the extent of changes in glycaemic parameters was clearly higher 
with pasireotide LAR compared with octreotide LAR. Also, even in diabetic patients on anti-diabetic treatments, 
long-term  microvascular  complications,  such  as  diabetic  nephropathy,  neuropathy  and  retinopathy  and 
macrovascular complications cannot be excluded. These complications represent major causes of morbidity and 
mortality  for  patients.  More  knowledge  is  needed  on  the  best  treatment  for  pasireotide-induced 
hyperglycaemia; in the meantime the treatment recommendations included in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The application is supported by two well-designed and well-conducted studies of considerable size ( taking into 
account that acromegaly is a rare disease). Data provided support the use of pasireotide as an alternative in 
patients with acromegaly, especially in patients who have failed on other somatostatin analogue treatment 
(uncontrolled patients).  
The risk of hyperglycaemia is clearly higher with pasireotide than with octreotide, but this risk is possible to 
monitor and data show that if hyperglycaemia occurs it can be managed with standard anti-diabetic treatment 
in the majority of cases. 
However, inducing hyperglycaemia/diabetes in medically naïve patients is not acceptable. Indeed efficacy with 
regard to GH and IGF-1 might be obtained in these patients with alternative treatments associated to a 
moderate risk of hyperglycaemia/diabetes. Thus, the benefit-risk balance of pasireotide LAR was found to be not

favourable in the group of medically naïve patients. The approved indication was therefore restricted to patients 
inadequately controlled with other treatments. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Pasireotide 20mg, 40mg, 60 mg, powder and solvent for suspension for injection in the 
treatment of Acromegaly is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation 
subject to the following conditions:

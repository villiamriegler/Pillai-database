add ‘atypical fractures of other bones’ as a new ADR 
with frequency ‘not known’ and to include further 
information about the risk of ‘atypical 
subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures’, 
based on post-marketing case reports and literature. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement 
minor editorial changes and to bring the product 
information in line with the latest QRD template and 
to update the list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet.

data 
subtrochanteric and diaphyseal long bone fractures 
(bisphosphonate class adverse reaction) remains rare. 
Atypical fractures of other bones, such as the ulna and tibia 
have also been reported in patients receiving long-term 
treatment. As with atypical femoral fractures, these 
fractures occur after minimal, or no trauma and some 
patients experience prodromal pain prior to presenting with 
a completed fracture. In cases of ulna fracture, this may be 
associated with repetitive stress loading associated with the 
long-term use of walking aids.

Product Characteristics.

As the information about ONJ in the Product Information

minimisation measures for ONJ as identified in the Article 
5(3) Referral on bisphosphonates and ONJ, additional 
wording fully reflecting those key messages were 
implemented in SPC section 4.4.  The description of ONJ in 
SPC section 4.8 was shortened. The PL was amended 
accordingly, informing patients about the symptoms of ONJ 
and what action to take; advising on the need for patients 
to maintain good oral hygiene, to receive routine dental 
check ups and to report any oral symptoms such as dental

oesophagus as one of the oesophageal diseases 
requiring caution when alendronate therapy is 
administered, following a request from the CHMP. 
Update of section 2 of the PL accordingly. 
The marketing authorisation numbers and date of 
first authorisation were also included in the SPC and 
labelling. 
Labelling and 
of alendronate and oesophageal carcinoma, the CHMP 
PL 
concluded that Barrett's oesophagus is a potentially 
premalignant condition of the oesophagus and a significant 
marker for the development of oesophageal cancer.  
Although the data are currently inconclusive and further 
investigation is required, the possibility that alendronate 
use may be associated with an increased risk of 
oesophageal cancer can not be excluded.  
Therefore Barrett's oesophagus was included as a warning 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
in section 4.4 of the SPC.

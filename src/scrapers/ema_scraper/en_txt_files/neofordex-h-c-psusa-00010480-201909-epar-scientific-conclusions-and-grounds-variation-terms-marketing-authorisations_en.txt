Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for dexamethasone (centrally 
authorised product indicated in symptomatic multiple myeloma), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are 
as follows:  
Following a Members State’s request for PRAC advice for another systemic dexamethasone product, the 
PRAC advised that a warning regarding the risk of pheochromocytoma crisis should be included in section 
4.4 of the SmPC and in the corresponding section of the PL, given that several other nationally authorised 
corticosteroids,  including  dexamethasone  products,  already  contain  warnings  on  pheochromocytoma 
crisis.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dexamethasone (centrally authorised product indicated in 
symptomatic multiple myeloma) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the 
medicinal product(s) containing dexamethasone (centrally authorised product indicated in symptomatic 
multiple myeloma) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

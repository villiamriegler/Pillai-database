2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is for LIBTAYO in combination with platinum
based chemotherapy for the first
line treatment of adult patients with NSCLC with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations, who have: 
‐
‐
• 
locally advanced NSCLC who are not candidates for definitive chemoradiation or 
•  metastatic NSCLC. 
The indication as adopted by CHMP is for LIBTAYO in combination with platinum
for the first
line treatment of adult patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 (in ≥ 1% of tumour cells), 
based chemotherapy 
‐
with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations, who have: 
‐
• 
• 
locally advanced NSCLC who are not candidates for definitive chemoradiation, or 
metastatic NSCLC. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer death worldwide in 2020. It represented 11.4% of all new 
cancer diagnoses with over 2 million new cases and 18.0% of all cancer-related mortality with over 1.8 
million deaths (Sung, 2021). The highest incidence rates among males are reported from 
Micronesia/Polynesia, Eastern Europe, and Eastern Asia, ranging from 51.6 to 48.1 per 100,000 males. 
Among females, the highest incidence rates are reported from North America, Northern Europe, and 
Western Europe, ranging from 30.1 to 25.0 per 100,000 females. In 2020, an estimated 235,760 new 
cases of lung cancer were diagnosed in the US and 131,880 people died from the disease (American 
Cancer Society, 2021). In the EU an estimated 318,327 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed and 
257,293 people died from the disease (European Cancer Information System (ECIS), 2021).  
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80% to 85% of all lung cancers and is composed of 
several histopathological subtypes, the most common of which are adenocarcinoma (40% to 60%) and 
squamous cell carcinoma (approximately 30%).  
Cigarette smoking is estimated to account for approximately 80-90% of all lung cancers.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
At the time of first diagnosis, the majority of patients with NSCLC are found to have advanced disease 
that is not amenable to surgery with curative intent or that has spread to distant organs outside the 
thorax (American Cancer Society, 2021).

Until the availability of immunotherapy, systemic therapy with platinum doublet regimens, with or 
without maintenance therapy, has been the standard of care for first-line treatment of patients with 
advanced NSCLC whose tumours do not have an EGFR mutation, an ALK mutation, or ROS1 fusion 
(Besse, 2014) (Ettinger, 2018) (Reck, 2014). These regimens are still the standard of care for patients 
in countries where anti-PD-1 therapy is not approved, reimbursed, or readily available. Despite optimal 
treatment, patients have a median overall survival (OS) of approximately 8 to 12 months and a 5-year 
survival rate of approximately 4-8% (Howlader, 2019), (Siegel, 2016), (American Cancer society). 
Management 
Locally advanced (definitive chemoradiation not feasible) or metastatic NSCLC is incurable, 
and therefore is considered a serious and life-threatening condition. The treatment goals in patients 
with locally advanced (definitive chemoradiation not feasible) or metastatic NSCLC are to reduce 
tumour burden, slow or delay progression and metastasis, prolong OS, reduce cancer-induced 
complications, and optimize quality of life (QoL).   
In recent years, substantial progress has been made in the field of immuno-oncology and 
immunotherapy has become part of the standard of care for metastatic NSCLC. Agents that block the 
immunosuppressive PD-1/PD-L1 axis (often called “immune checkpoint blockade”), such as the 
anti-PD-1 antibodies cemiplimab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab or the anti PD-L1 antibodies 
atezolizumab and durvalumab, have collectively shown clinical activity in NSCLC and improvement in 
patient’s outcome in different clinical settings (Tecentriq EPAR,.Keytruda EPAR, Libtayo EPAR, Opdivo 
EPAR, Imfinzi EPAR)  
First line treatment: According to the ESMO guidelines for non-oncogene addicted metastatic NSCLC 
(Hendricks et al, Ann Onc 2023), the treatment strategy for a patient with a newly diagnosed, 
metastatic NSCLC without an oncogenic driver includes consideration of histology, tumour genotype, 
PD-L1 expression, PS, co-morbidities, and the patient’s preferences. In general, systemic therapy 
should be offered to all patients with stage IV NSCLC with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) PS of 0-2. A combination of platinum-based ChT plus programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-
1)/PD-L1 blockade is the most common treatment approach for a patient with newly-diagnosed stage 
IV NSCLC (monotherapy ICI for patients with PD-L1 ≥50% is discussed in the “first-line monotherapy 
immunotherapy” subsection below). Several combination regimens have successfully demonstrated 
improved overall survival (OS) compared with ChT alone. These have included platinum-based ChT 
plus: pembrolizumab (non-squamous non-small-cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), 
atezolizumab with or without bevacizumab (non-squamous non-small-cell carcinoma only), nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab (non-squamous non-small-cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), cemiplimab 
(non-squamous non-small-cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), and durvalumab plus 
tremelimumab (non-squamous non-small-cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma). Of note, at 
the time of publication of such guidelines, the combination of tremelimumab + durvalumab + 
chemotherapy and cemiplimab + chemotherapy had not been approved by the EC. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Cemiplimab (REGN2810) belongs to the pharmacological class of immunomodulatory monoclonal 
antibodies. Cemiplimab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4 monoclonal antibody that 
binds to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and blocks its interaction with programmed death-ligand 1 
(PD-L1) and programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2), countering PD-1 mediated inhibition of the immune 
response, including the anti-tumour immune response.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/118736/2023  
Page 9/105 
 
 
 
Cemiplimab 350 mg as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks (Q3W) is approved 
as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
whose tumours have high (tumour proportion score [TPS] ≥50%) PD-L1 expression in the United 
States (US) and European Union (EU) (see SmPC section 5.1). It has also received global approvals for 
the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) after 
treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI), the treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and the treatment of recurrent or metastatic 
cervical cancer.  
The proposed dose of cemiplimab is 350 mg Q3W administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 
30 minutes until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The aspects of the scientific advice are discussed under the clinical efficacy part (section 2.4). 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The clinical studies presented in this application were conducted in accordance with the ethical 
principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with the 
International Council for Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and applicable regulatory 
requirements. Consultations with health authorities in the US and EU have been conducted regarding 
the clinical development program and study design. 
However, the MAH identified a violation regarding RECIST evaluation, at the vendor’s side, concerning 
an inborn error in the measurement of lymph node selected as target lesion. This error was 
investigated, and no influence on the primary endpoint of OS was identified. Though, in future studies, 
attention should be drawn to the validity of the response assessment system used. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A claim of exclusion from submitting environmental risk assessment studies was made according to 
Section 2 of the 2006 CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (ERA Guideline, EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) because cemiplimab is a monoclonal 
antibody consisting of linked naturally occurring amino acids.  
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH provided a justification in accordance with the Guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) for not submitting 
ERA studies. Cemiplimab is a protein composed of natural amino acids. Proteins are biodegradable in 
the environment and thus do not pose any environmental risk. Therefore, according to the “Guideline 
on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/118736/2023  
Page 10/105 
 
 
 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), it is acceptable that no ERA studies were submitted for 
cemiplimab. 
Considering its nature, cemiplimab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic, and immunogenicity data for the proposed indication are 
based on results from the ongoing pivotal Study R2810-ONC-16113 Part 2 (Study 16113 Part 2) per 
the data cut-off of 14 June 2021. Study 16113 is a two-part study; where Parts 1 and 2 are 
independent of each other.  Study 16113 Part 2 was designed to provide confirmatory evidence for 
cemiplimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (cemiplimab/chemo) for the treatment 
of patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC irrespective of PD-L1 expression, who received 
no prior systemic treatment for their advanced disease. Based on the design difference between Study 
16113 Part 1 and study 16113 Part 2, the results of Study 16113 Part 1 are not relevant to this 
submission. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

For all studies, the PK analysis set (PKAS) included patients who received cemiplimab and who had at 
least 1 non-missing concentration of cemiplimab following the first dose of cemiplimab up to the end of 
the study.  
In Study 16113 Part 2, the PKAS was based on the actual treatment received (as treated) rather than 
as randomized. For the cemiplimab studies mentioned in the cross-study comparison and included in 
the population PK analyses sets, blood samples collected for the assessment of cemiplimab 
concentrations in serum were described in the respective clinical study reports. In brief, dense PK 
sampling after the first dose followed by sparse PK sampling during treatment and follow-up occurred 
in the First-in-human (FIH) Study 1423 which included patients with NSCLC, while all the pivotal 
studies on specific solid tumour types used sparse sampling.  
In the FIH Study 1423, where cemiplimab concentration data were assessed using dense PK sampling 
after the first dose and sparse sampling during the remainder of treatment, noncompartmental 
analysis (NCA) was used to determine PK parameters after the first dose, and summarized using 
descriptive statistics. Mean observed cemiplimab Ctrough and Cmax during treatment were reported by 
nominal time with descriptive statistics. Data from Study 1423 included 1 patient with NSCLC (reported 
as “other“ by Papadopoulos, 2020 and as “solid tumors” in the PopPK database) who received 
cemiplimab 1 mg/kg Q2W, 20 patients with NSCLC at 200 mg Q2W in monotherapy (EXP1), 33 
patients at cemiplimab 3 mg/kg Q2W with radiotherapy (EXP2), 6 patients at 3 mg/kg Q2W with 
chemotherapy (EXP17), and 6 patients each in EXP21 and EXP 22 at 3 mg/kg Q3W with chemotherapy. 
Data from patients with NSCLC in pivotal studies included 345 patients from Study 1624 receiving 
cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV as monotherapy, and 295 patients from Study 16113 Part 2 on 
cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV with chemotherapy. In the pivotal studies where only sparse PK sampling 
was available, observed cemiplimab Ctrough and Cmax during treatment were reported by nominal time 
with descriptive statistics. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Population Pharmacokinetic Modelling Report R2810-PK-21192-SR-01V1 
The objectives of this population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis were to:  
•  Assess consistency of cemiplimab pharmacokinetics (PK) in NSCLC patients treated with 
cemiplimab plus chemotherapy in Study R2810-ONC-16113 (referred to as 16113) compared 
to other cancer types.

• 
Investigate possible sources of inconsistencies, if any, in the PK of cemiplimab in Study 16113.  
Population PK of cemiplimab was described using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling by way of 
NONMEM, Version 7.4.1 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, Maryland). Pre- and post-
processing of data from each modelling step was conducted using R (Version 4.0.2). 
The PopPK model (R2810-PK-20039-SR-01V1) in 1062 patients was updated for cemiplimab in an 
overall population of 1063 patients from 4 Studies (1423, 1540, 1620 and 1624) to provide support for 
approval of cemiplimab monotherapy at 350 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) in patients with advanced 
cervical cancer using an external validation approach (R2810-PK-21056-SR-01V1). The two-
compartment base model, with zero-order IV infusion, a first-order elimination and a sigmoid Emax 
function to empirically describe a time-varying change in clearance, was updated to improve model 
stability which was demonstrated by 94.8% successful bootstrap runs (compared to 47.6% in the 
previous model). The major changes made to the previous model involved removing random effects on 
the maximum change in CL with time (Emax), removing random effects on the time for CL to decline by 
50% of its maximum value (T50), and only utilizing log additive residual error. 
The following covariates were evaluated at their baseline values: body weight, age, sex, albumin, 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, predicted creatinine 
clearance, serum creatinine, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, race, ethnicity and 
tumour types, together with time-varying albumin level. The covariates retained in the final model 
were baseline body weight, sex, time-varying albumin, baseline ALT, CSCC tumour type, and BCC 
tumour type on clearance (relative to NSCLC); baseline body weight, sex and baseline albumin on 
distribution volume; BCC tumour type on Emax; and other tumour type on T50. Similar to the model in 
1062 patients, cemiplimab demonstrated weight dependent clearance and distribution volume 
consistent with the PK properties of monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, cemiplimab clearance had an 
inverse linear relationship with time-varying albumin level, indicating lower clearance as albumin levels 
increase. Baseline clearance was estimated to be approximately 20% higher in patients with NSCLC 
compared to patients with CSCC and BCC tumour types. The impact of baseline IgG level (only 
available in Studies 1423 and 1540) on cemiplimab clearance was assessed in a post-hoc analysis 
using the updated final model. Consistent with the previous analysis, higher baseline IgG levels were 
associated with greater cemiplimab clearance and lower exposures compared to patients with lower 
baseline IgG levels. The updated final model in 1063 patients is the current PopPK model (R2810-PK-

The current final PopPK model (R2810-PK-21056-SR-01V1) was used to evaluate consistency in 
cemiplimab PK for patients with NSCLC in Study 16113 via an external visual predictive check (VPC). 
Parameter estimates were fixed to the estimates from the current final model and used to generate 
datasets (N = 500) which replicated the design, dose regimen, sample size, and covariate distribution 
for patients with NSCLC in Study 16113. From the 500 simulated datasets conditioned upon the 
observed study design, 90% confidence intervals (CIs, i.e., 5th and 95th percentiles) were calculated 
for the median, 5th and 95th percentiles of cemiplimab concentration with nominal time since first 
dose. The statistical intervals and 90% CIs of simulated concentration data as a function of time were 
overlaid with the observed cemiplimab concentrations in order to provide a visual assessment of the 
predictive performance of the current final model for the PK data in patients with NSCLC in Study 
16113. If the median, 5th, and 95th percentile of observed concentration data were generally 
contained within their respective simulated confidence intervals, the PK of cemiplimab in Study 16113 
would be considered as comparable to that in previous studies. Result of the external VPC for Study 
16113 can be seen in Figure 1.

Re-estimation of Model Parameters 
Cemiplimab concentration data from Study 16113 were combined with the original dataset consisting 
of 4 studies (i.e., 1423, 1540, 1620 and 1624) and parameters were re-estimated in the current final 
PopPK model. PK parameter estimates for the original 4 studies and for the combined 5 studies (i.e., 
1423, 1540, 1620, 1624 and 16113) are provided in Table 2. Point estimates for structural model 
parameters were within 8% for all parameters except T50 with a 20.6% difference. Goodness-of-fit 
plots for the current final model fit to the data from 5 studies, including Study 16113, are shown in 
Figure 2.

The variation in cemiplimab PK due to study differences was explored by evaluating the distribution of 
population PK parameters predicted by the current PopPK model with 4 studies (i.e., 1423, 1540, 1620 
and 1624) compared to the distribution of parameters from the model after incorporating Study 16113 
data. Empirical Bayesian estimates (EBEs) of CL and V1 were derived from the current final model (4 
studies) and the model refit with Study 16113 included (5 studies). The histograms showed that the 
distributions of CL and V1 parameters were essentially unchanged when the model was fit to data from 
4 studies (i.e., 1423, 1540, 1620 and 1624) or 5 studies (i.e., 1423, 1540, 1620, 1624 and 16113), 
suggesting consistency in cemiplimab PK across studies. 
Time-varying albumin level and body weight were investigated as potential covariates to account for 
the variability in Study 16113. These variables may reflect possible differences in disease progression 
in each study population, which could potentially influence drug clearance. The observed data showed 
that the time course of albumin levels was identical between NSCLC patients in Study 16113 and Study 
1624, and albumin was not explored further. A time-varying body weight covariate was tested on 
cemiplimab CL in the current final model but did not explain the difference in exposure between 
studies. Study 16113 covariate effects were subsequently tested on the model parameters CL, V1, T50 
and Emax using a forward selection procedure, followed by backward elimination. The covariates 
retained in the model were Study 16113 effects on CL and V1. Simulations were performed to assess 
the magnitude of Study 16113 covariate effects on post-hoc estimates of area under the curve 
(AUC3wks,ss), peak concentration (Cmax,ss), and minimum concentration (Cmin,ss) over a 3-week dosing 
interval at steady-state. A reference subject was created with the following conditions: male, NSCLC 
patient in Study 1624, albumin 38.6 g/L (baseline albumin and time-varying covariate remained 
unchanged in simulated studies), baseline body weight 75 kg, and baseline alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) 19 IU/L. Reference conditions for continuous covariates reflect the approximate median value in 
the analysis population. 
A virtual subject was created for each test condition differing from the reference subject only in tumour 
type or study. Cemiplimab dosing was simulated as 350 mg every 3 weeks with a full PK profile (PRED) 
simulated over a dosing interval at steady-state. Each of the virtual subjects were simulated 500 
times. A unique set of parameter estimates was utilized for each iteration, drawn randomly from the 
parameter distributions (mean, variance-covariance matrix) as determined from the current final 
model with Study 16113 covariates on CL and V1. Relevant exposure metrics were calculated from the 
steady-state PK profile and the ratio of test-to-reference conditions was calculated and plotted to 
illustrate the influence of tumour type or study on the exposure metrics in relation to the reference 
NSCLC patient from Study 1624. Impact of Study 16113-covariate on Cmax,ss can be seen in Figure 3.

FIH Study 1423 (Patients with Advanced NSCLC) 
The FIH Study 1423 evaluated a range of cemiplimab doses (dose escalation phase: 1 to 10 mg/kg 
Q2W IV). Patients enrolled in Study 1423 had various tumour types, including CSCC, BCC, NSCLC, and 
recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer (R/M CC). A total of 72 patients with NSCLC received 
cemiplimab in Study 1423: 1 patient in the docetaxel cohort received cemiplimab at 1 mg/kg Q2W 
(Papadopoulos, 2020), and in the expansion cohorts, patients with NSCLC not receiving chemotherapy 
received cemiplimab at a fixed dose of 200 mg Q2W in monotherapy (EXP1; N=20) or at 3 mg/kg Q2W 
with radiotherapy (EXP2; N=33), or 3 mg/kg Q2W with chemotherapy (EXP17, N=6), or 3 mg/kg Q3W 
with chemotherapy (EXP21 and EXP 22, N=6 in each cohort).  
The PK of cemiplimab was linear and dose-proportional in Study 1423. Cemiplimab PK was similar 
across tumour types and regardless of treatment (i.e., as monotherapy or in combination with 
radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). Pharmacokinetics in patients with NSCLC in Study 1423 were 
similar to those in the overall population of patients with various solid tumour types. In the two 
expansion cohorts of patients with NSCLC (EXP21 and EXP22) AUC was assessed over a 3-week dosing 
interval with Q3W dosing. Therefore, the AUC3W after Q3W dosing was higher compared the AUC2W 
assessed over a 2 week dosing interval after Q2W dosing. For the same reasons, C-trough was slightly 
lower and the half-life was slightly longer when assessed over a 3-week dosing interval compared to a 
2-week dosing interval (Table 3).

Study 1624 (Patients with Advanced NSCLC) 
The pivotal Study 1624 evaluated the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of cemiplimab in 
patients with advanced NSCLC on cemiplimab at 350 mg Q3W IV as monotherapy. 
In the overall PK population of patients with advanced NSCLC receiving cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV 
(N=345), and based on observed cemiplimab exposure, steady state was reached by about 18 weeks 
of treatment. Upon repeated 350 mg Q3W IV dosing, cemiplimab concentrations increased 
approximately 2-fold compared to the first dose. 
Pivotal Study 16113 Part 2 
Concentration-time profiles by tumour histology type (squamous or non-squamous) and by PD-L1 
expression level (<1%, 1% to 49%, and ≥50%) overlapped, indicating similar cemiplimab exposure 
(Ctrough and Cmax) regardless of histology type or PD-L1 expression level. 
In the overall population of patients with NSCLC receiving cemiplimab included in the PKAS (N = 295), 
the mean (SD) cemiplimab Cmax and Ctrough values after the first dose were 95.3 (48.6) mg/L and 
21.5 (18.4) mg/L, respectively. At steady state, mean (SD) Cmax was 129 (46.9) mg/L (based on week 
9; n = 236) and Ctrough was 48.6 (25.0) mg/L (based on week 24; n = 177). Ctrough values at steady 
state were approximately 2-fold of those after the first dose. The Cmax/Ctrough ratio (peak to trough) at 
steady state was approximately 2 to 3. Achievement of steady state for Ctrough and Cmax in the overall 
population is illustrated in the box plots, which indicated similar concentrations from week 9 onwards.

Comparison of Pharmacokinetics Across Studies 
Cemiplimab concentrations in serum and pharmacokinetics were similar in patients with different solid 
tumour types and across studies, as previously described in details based on observed cemiplimab 
concentrations and population-predicted PK characteristics.

Consistently across tumour types the concentration-time profiles over the first dosing interval was 
characterized by a brief distribution phase followed by a mono-exponential elimination phase. The 
overall cemiplimab PK characteristics were similar in patients with different tumour types as shown by 
the full concentration time profiles within Study 1423 at 3 mg/kg Q2W and across the pivotal studies 
and tumour types (1540, 1620, 1624, 1676 and 16113 Part 2) at 350 mg Q3W and Ctrough and Cmax 
steady state concentrations. Observed cemiplimab exposure (Ctrough and Cmax) during therapy at 350 
mg Q3W was also compared between 295 patients with NSCLC in Study 16113 Part 2 and patients with 
advanced CSCC, BCC, NSCLC and R/M CC in the respective pivotal studies, showing similarity in 
cemiplimab exposure across tumour types over time and regardless of the treatment; numerical values 
at steady state are summarized in Table 4.

Distribution and elimination 
The PK of cemiplimab was characterized using a 2-compartment model with zero-order IV infusion and 
first-order elimination, that included a sigmoid Emax function to empirically describe a time-varying 
decrease in CL.  
Cemiplimab demonstrated a weight-dependent CL and volume of distribution consistent with the PK 
properties of mAbs.

Special populations 
Cemiplimab CL had an inverse linear relationship with time-varying albumin level, indicating lower CL 
as albumin levels increase (see Population Pharmacokinetic Modelling Report R2810-PK-21192-SR-
01V1). None of the other covariates identified as statistically significant in this model (sex, baseline 
alanine aminotransferase, tumour type) were considered to have a meaningful impact on cemiplimab 
exposure. Post-hoc covariate analysis for baseline IgG and baseline PD-L1 expression, available in a 
limited number of patients and/or studies, indicated no meaningful effect on cemiplimab exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No PK interaction studies were submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Cemiplimab (REGN2810) belongs to the pharmacological class of immunomodulatory monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs). Cemiplimab is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/118736/2023  
Page 23/105 
 
 
 
 
binds to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with its ligands PD L1 
and PD L2. Engagement of PD 1 with its ligands PD L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed by antigen 
presenting cells and may be expressed by tumour cells and/or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment, results in inhibition of T cell function such as proliferation, cytokine secretion, and 
cytotoxic activity. Cemiplimab potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through 
blockade of PD 1 binding to PD L1 and PD L2 ligands. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic Results in Patients with NSCLC 
In Study 16113 Part 2, the percent change in tumour size in patients with NSCLC on 
cemiplimab/chemo or placebo/chemo was assessed as a pharmacodynamic marker of efficacy.  
Patients with NSCLC in Study 16113 Part 2 were reported by PD-L1 expression category as follow: 
cemiplimab/chemo PD-L1 expression categories: ≥50%, 1% to 49%, and <1%; placebo/chemo PD-L1 
expression category: ≥50%, 1% to 49%, and <1%.  
Figure 8: Median percent change in tumour size per independent review committee in patients with 
NSCLC (FAS; study 16113, Part 2) 
Immunogenicity 
In clinical studies, serum samples were collected from patients in the cemiplimab group throughout the 
treatment and post-treatment periods to determine anti-drug antibody (ADA) status. 
Immunogenicity assessment was reported for patients with NSCLC who received cemiplimab in Study 
16113 Part 2 (200 patients), and reported by dose for a combined total of 1229 patients with solid 
tumours across studies; 1423 (solid tumours, 337 patients), 1540 (CSCC, 140 patients), 1620 (BCC, 
125 patients), 1624 (NSCLC, 221 patients), and 1676 (R/M CC, 206 patients); for a total of 791 
patients treated with cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV (Table 5, below).

Immunogenicity in Patients with NSCLC in Study 16113 Part 2 
Immunogenicity in patients with NSCLC in Study 16113 Part 2 (273 patients; 73 patients receiving 
placebo/chemo and 200 patients receiving cemiplimab/chemo) was low. Treatment-emergent ADA was 
observed in a total of 12 patients (4.4%), 5 patients on placebo/chemo (6.8%) and 7 patients on 
cemiplimab/chemo (3.5%), of which 1 was transient, 6 were indeterminate and all were low titer 
(<1,000) with no neutralising antibody (Nab) detected. One patient on placebo/chemo had treatment 
emergent indeterminate ADA at moderate titer (7,290) and a positive NAb response (Table 5). 
Cemiplimab concentrations in patients with treatment-emergent ADA-positive response were similar to 
those in patients with pre-existing or ADA-negative response. No effect of ADA on cemiplimab 
exposure was observed in patients with NSCLC in this study. 
Table 5: Summary of ADA status and category, maximum titer, and Nab status by treatment group in 
patients with NSCLC (study R2810-ONC-16113 Part 2) 
Immunogenicity in All Patients with Solid Tumours 
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA in all patients with solid tumours in the ADA analysis set 
(n=1229) was low (2.4%) (Table 6). Only 3 patients (0.2%) had a persistent ADA response: 1 patient 
at 1 mg/kg Q2W IV, 1 patient at 3 mg/kg Q2W IV, and 1 patient at 350 mg Q3W IV. The ADA titers 
were generally low. None of the ADA-positive samples revealed the presence of NAbs. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA in the subset of patients who received cemiplimab 350 mg 
Q3W IV was similarly low (2.5%). The presence of treatment-emergent ADA did not appear to have an 
effect on cemiplimab concentrations in serum.

2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
See section 2.3.2 for results on population PK modelling. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic, and immunogenicity data for the proposed indication are 
based on results from the ongoing pivotal Study R2810-ONC-16113 Part 2 per the data cut-off of 14 
June 2021. Limited PK data was collected as part of Study 16113 Part 2, designed to provide 
confirmatory evidence for cemiplimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy 
(cemiplimab/chemo) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC 
irrespective of PD-L1 expression, who received no prior systemic treatment for their advanced disease. 
However, in the FIH Study 1423 cemiplimab concentration data were assessed using dense PK 
sampling after the first dose and sparse sampling during the remainder of treatment. 
In FIH study 1423,  the pharmacokinetics of cemiplimab in patients with NSCLC were found to be 
similar to those in the overall population of patients with various solid tumour types (see Table 3).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/118736/2023  
Page 26/105 
 
 
 
 
The concentration-time profiles over the first dosing interval is characterized by a brief distribution 
phase followed by a mono-exponential elimination phase observed consistently across tumour types. 
Furthermore, the overall cemiplimab PK characteristics are similar in patients with different tumour 
types.  
Observed cemiplimab exposure (Ctrough and Cmax) during therapy at 350 mg Q3W was compared 
between 295 patients with NSCLC in Study 16113 Part 2 and patients with advanced CSCC, BCC, 
NSCLC and R/M CC in the respective pivotal studies. Cmax and Cthrough tended to be lower in the NSCLC 
group that was receiving combination therapy as compared to the NSCLC monotherapy group. 
However, the numerically lower exposure of cemiplimab in patients with NSCLC by about 20% 
remained well within the inter-patient variability in exposure (CV of 40%) in the overall patient 
population and was therefore considered as not being clinically relevant.  
Consistent with the incidence of ADA observed across all studies, the incidence of treatment emergent 
ADA (3.5%) appeared to be low with no persistent ADA observed in patients with NSCLC who received 
cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV with chemotherapy in Study 16113 Part 2.  
External validation of the existing PopPK model demonstrated slight model overprediction of 
cemiplimab concentrations for patients with NSCLC treated with cemiplimab plus chemotherapy in 
Study 16113. Re-estimation of PK parameters with inclusion of data from Study 16113 were 
comparable to the existing PopPK model. Differences in cemiplimab PK in patients from Study 16113 
were explored but no new covariates could be identified except ‘Study 16113’ as a covariate effect on 
CL and V1. Simulations were performed to evaluate the magnitude of the ‘Study 16113’-covariate 
effect on post-hoc estimates of exposure metrics (AUC3wks,ss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss) and all exposure 
metrics were predicted to be approximately 20% lower in NSCLC patients from Study 16113 when 
compared to a NSCLC monotherapy patient. The numerically lower exposure of cemiplimab in patients 
with NSCLC by about 20% remains well within the inter-patient variability in exposure (CV of 40%) in 
the overall patient population and is therefore considered as not being clinically relevant.  
No update of the SmPC is required based on the clinical pharmacology data submitted as part of this 
application. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of cemiplimab in patients with NSCLC receiving cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV with chemotherapy 
in the pivotal Study 16113 Part 2 is similar to the PK previously described in patients with NSCLC 
based on the data provided from FIH Study 1423 and pivotal Study 1624.

baseline (except for residual signs or symptoms related to the CNS treatment) for at least 2 weeks 
prior to enrollment. Patients must be off (immunosuppressive doses of) corticosteroid therapy (see 
exclusion criteria 7 for details on timing of discontinuation of steroids). 
2. Patients with tumors tested positive for EGFR gene mutations, ALK gene translocations, or ROS1 
fusions. All patients will have tumor evaluated for EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangement, and ROS1 
fusions confirmed by a central laboratory. 
3. Encephalitis, meningitis, or uncontrolled seizures in the year prior to enrollment. 
4. History of interstitial lung disease, of active, non-infectious pneumonitis that required immune-
suppressive doses of glucocorticoids to assist with management, or of pneumonitis within the last 5 
years.  
7. Ongoing or recent evidence of significant autoimmune disease that required treatment with systemic 
immunosuppressive treatments. 
8. Patients with a condition requiring corticosteroid therapy within 14 days of randomization.  
9. Another malignancy that is progressing or requires treatment. 
10. Known active hepatitis B or known hepatitis C virus (HCV). Uncontrolled infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HCV infection; or diagnosis of 
immunodeficiency. 
11. Active infection requiring systemic therapy within 14 days prior to randomization. 
12. Prior therapy with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. 
13. Treatment-related immune-mediated AEs from immune-modulatory agents that have not resolved 
to baseline at least 3 months prior to initiation of treatment with study therapy.  
Treatments 
Patients in Part 2 were randomized to standard of care platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus 
cemiplimab or platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus saline/dextrose placebo (placebo).  
Treatment began within 3 days of randomization. A treatment cycle was defined as 21 days or 
3 weeks. 
Cemiplimab 350 mg was to be administered as an IV infusion Q3W for up to 108 weeks. Patients 
treated with cemiplimab were permitted to continue treatment beyond initial RECIST 1.1-defined 
progressive disease if the investigator perceives the patient to be experiencing clinical benefit, the 
patient has not completed the 108-week treatment period and the patient meets the following criteria: 
Investigator assessed no rapid disease progression; Patient continues to meet all other study eligibility 
criteria; Patient is tolerant of cemiplimab and has a stable performance status; Treatment beyond 
progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease 
progression. 
Chemotherapy will be administered Q3W as outlined in Table 8 below for 4 cycles or until RECIST 1.1-
defined progressive disease or early treatment discontinuation for another reason. Chemotherapy will 
be administered according to local prescribing information and practice guidelines. The choice of 
chemotherapy will be one of the regimens shown in Table 8 (below). The investigator may choose 
from one of these regimens provided that it is consistent with the local standard-of-care. Assignment 
of the chemotherapy choice must be made prior to randomization.

Radiographic tumour assessments were obtained every 9 weeks (Q9W) beginning at week 9 (day 63 ± 
5 days) during year 1, and every 12 weeks (Q12W), beginning at week 55 (first radiographic tumour 
assessment in year 2 was performed at end of week 54) during year 2, until Independent Review 
Committee (IRC)-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1-defined 
progressive disease, withdrawal of consent, death, or initiation of another anti-cancer treatment.  
Patients could be unblinded to treatment at the time of progressive disease defined by RECIST 1.1 
criteria or discontinuation from the study. After completion of the treatment period, patients entered 
the follow-up period. Patients in Treatment Arm B who experienced RECIST 1.1-defined progressive 
disease on anti-PD-1 antibody therapy could continue treatment with cemiplimab beyond progression if 
the investigator judged the patient to be experiencing clinical benefit and if the patient had not 
completed the 108-week treatment period. Alternatively, patients in either arm of the study who 
progressed could opt to initiate a new anti-cancer treatment, another clinical trial, or best supportive 
care. The study protocol also mandated that cemiplimab must be discontinued and other anti-cancer 
therapy considered in case of further progressive disease, defined as an additional 10% increase in 
tumour burden from the time of initial progressive disease (including an increase in the sum of all 
target lesions and/or the development of new lesions). 
Objectives 
Additional objectives included characterization of PFS, objective tumour responses, patient-reported 
outcomes, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK). 
Primary objective:  
•  To determine if cemiplimab/chemo improved overall survival (OS) over placebo/chemo in first line 
treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/118736/2023  
Page 31/105 
 
 
 
Secondary objectives:  
•  To determine if cemiplimab/chemo improved progression free survival (PFS) over placebo/chemo in 
first line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC.  
•  To compare overall response rate (ORR) from cemiplimab/chemo to that of placebo/chemo  
•  To compare the duration of response (DOR) from cemiplimab/chemo to that from placebo/chemo  
•  To compare patient reported quality of life (QoL) when treated with cemiplimab/chemo to when 
treated with placebo/chemo  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was OS, defined as the date from randomization to the date of death. A 
patient who had not died was censored at the last known date of contact. 
The secondary endpoints are PFS, ORR (and BOR), DoR, QoL (PRO), OS at 12, 18 and 24 months. 
•  PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor 
progression or death due to any cause. PFS was assessed by a blinded independent review 
committee (BIRC) BIRC using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.  
Censoring for PFS: patients with no documented tumor progression or death or no documented 
tumor progression or death before initiation of new anti-tumor therapy were censored on the date 
of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Patients who withdrew consent before taking any study 
treatment or who did not have any evaluable tumor assessments after randomization and did not 
die were censored on the date of randomization. 
•  ORR is defined as best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR) divided by the number of patients in the efficacy analysis set.  
•  DOR is defined as time from the criteria are first met for CR/PR until the first date of recurrent or 
progressive disease (radiographic), or death due to any cause.  
Censoring for DOR: patients who never progress while being followed or who do not have a 
documented tumor progression or death before initiation of new anti-tumor therapy at the last valid 
tumor measurement.  
•  QoL was measured using the following questionnaires: EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13 and 
defined as change in scores from baseline in the global health status (GHS)/QoL, physical 
functioning scales, and lung cancer symptoms. 
Sample size 
Historically, in patients with Stage IIIB or Stage IV NSCLC treated with cisplatin or carboplatin + 
paclitaxel Q3W, the median PFS has ranged from approximately 2.7 to 6.4 months (El-Shenshawy 
2012, Rosell 2002, Scagliotti 2002, Schiller 2002, Shimizu 2013, Socinski 2016); the median OS has 
ranged from approximately 11.3 to 20.9 months (Socinski 2016, De Lima Lopes 2018, Borghaei 2017, 
Brahmer 2017, Gandhi 2018, Paz-Ares 2018). 
Based on those historical data, the sponsor assumed a median OS of 12 months for patients treated 
with chemotherapy plus placebo, and a hazard ratio of 0.65 in OS between cemiplimab/chemo arm and 
placebo/chemo arm.  
Patients were to be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the cemiplimab/chemof arm (Treatment Arm B) 
versus the placebo/chemo arm (Treatment Arm A). Under these assumptions, 291 deaths were needed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/118736/2023  
Page 32/105 
 
 
 
to yield approximately 93% power to detect statistical significance in OS at a 2-sided Type I error level 
or 0.05 between the two treatment arms. 
Considering an enrollment period of 14 months (11 patients per month for the first 4 months, 26 
patients per month for month 5 to 8, 50 patients per month afterwards), an approximately 24- month 
follow-up period for OS after completion of enrollment, and 10% annual dropout, the enrollment of 
approximately 450 randomized patients was needed to obtain 291 deaths for the final analysis of 
OS. 
Based on above historical data, the sponsor assumed a median PFS of 6 months for patients treated 
with chemotherapy plus placebo, and a hazard ratio of 0.6667 in PFS between the cemiplimab/chemo 
arm and placebo/chemo arm. With these assumptions and at two-sided 0.05 alpha level, the power for 
analysis of PFS was to be 90% or more if it was to be performed after 288 or more PFS events was 
observed. EAST® 6.4.1 was used for sample size calculation.  
Randomisation 
In Part 2, patients were to be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the cemiplimab/chemo arm (Treatment Arm 
B) versus the placebo/chemo-f arm (Treatment Arm A). Stratifications factors were baseline histology 
[non-squamous versus squamous] and PD-L1 level measured using Ventana SP263 PD-L1 IHC assay 
[<1% versus 1% to 49% versus ≥ 50%]). 
Patients with squamous NSCLC were to be capped at 50% of the total sample size. At least 30% but 
no more than 40% of patients enrolled must have had tumours that expressed PD-L1 in ≥50% of 
tumor cells. Enrollment of patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 in <1% of tumour cells was to be 
capped at 30% (PD-L1 <50% was capped at 70%). This approach was adopted to mirror the natural 
distribution of PD-L1 expression levels historically seen in NSCLC. 
Blinding (masking) 
Treatment for Part 2 of the study was double-blinded with the exception of an unblinded pharmacist at 
each site. Sites were to receive open label cemiplimab, which will be blinded by the unblinded 
pharmacist at each site. Patients, the principal investigators, and study site personnel (apart from the 
unblinded investigative site pharmacist) were to remain blinded to all randomization assignments 
throughout the study.   
Patients in Part 2 were to be unblinded at the time of treatment discontinuation for initial RECIST 1.1-
defined progressive disease or discontinuation from the study. 
A blinded independent review committee (IRC) composed of members independent from the sponsor 
and the study investigators was to review all available (de-identified) radiographic tumour assessments 
to determine tumour response based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. The IRC-determined tumour response 
was to be used in the analysis of the PFS, ORR, and DOR endpoints.   
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), composed of members who are independent from 
the sponsor and the study investigators, was to monitor patient safety by conducting formal reviews of 
accumulated safety data blinded by treatment arm; if requested, the IDMC may have access to the 
treatment allocation code, evaluate pre-planned interim analysis results which will be provided by an 
independent statistician, or any other requested data for the purposes of a risk-benefit assessment. 
The IDMC was to provide the sponsor with appropriate recommendations on the conduct of the clinical 
study to ensure the protection and safety of the patients enrolled in the study. The IDMC was to also

institute any measures that may be required for ensuring the integrity of the study results during the 
study execution. 
Statistical methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
The FAS was defined separately for Parts 1 and 2. The FAS included all patients to whom study 
treatment has been assigned by randomization in each study part. FAS was essentially the intention to 
treat population (ITT). Per ITT principle, patients were to be analysed according to the treatment and 
stratification factors they had been assigned to during the randomization. FAS was to be used for all 
baseline, demographic, and efficacy endpoints. 
The Safety Analysis Set (SAF) 
The SAF was defined separately for Part 1 and Part 2 of this study. The SAF included all randomized 
patients who received any study drug; it is based on the treatment received (as treated). Treatment 
administration and all clinical safety variables were to be analysed using the SAF. 
Primary endpoint OS 
For the time-to-event endpoints the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method was to be used to estimate 
the survival curves. The treatment difference in survival was to be assessed by the stratified log-rank 
test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling was to be used to 
assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (i.e., the hazard ratio). The hazard ratio and its 95% 
confidence interval from the stratified Cox model with a single treatment covariate were to be 
reported. The part specific stratification factors used for randomization per IWRS was to be applied to 
both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model. Median OS and PFS along with its 95% 
CI were to be presented for each treatment arm using Kaplan- Meier method. The Kaplan-Meier curves 
were to be displayed by treatment arm.  
Censoring rules for OS 
If a patient is not known to have died or is lost to follow up at the time of analysis cutoff date, the one 
will be censored at the last date that the patient was known to be alive. 
Key secondary endpoint PFS per ICR 
The same statistical methods described for OS were used. 
Censoring rules for PFS: 
• Patients who do not have a documented tumour progression or death will be censored on the date of 
their last evaluable tumour assessment. 
• Patients who do not have a documented tumour progression or death before initiation of new anti-
tumour therapy will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumour assessment prior to or on 
the date of new anti-tumour therapy. 
• Patients who withdraw consent before taking any study treatment, therefore there is no post baseline 
tumour assessment, will be censored at the date of randomization. 
• Patients who do not have any evaluable tumour assessments after randomization and do not die will 
be censored on the date of randomization. 
Key secondary endpoint ORR by ICR 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/118736/2023  
Page 34/105 
 
 
 
ORR was to be analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by part specific 
stratification factors at randomization per IWRS. Objective response rate and the corresponding exact 
95% CI were to be calculated by Clopper-Pearson method for each treatment arm. 
Patient(s) without baseline tumour assessment, or with either unknown or missing BOR were to be 
included in the denominator and will be counted as non-responder(s). 
Interim analyses and type I error control 
The analyses of primary endpoint of OS were to be performed as follows: 1) two interim analyses (IA) 
for OS performed when approximately 146 (50% out of total OS events) and 204 (70% out of total OS 
events) deaths are observed; 2) final analysis for OS performed when approximately 291 deaths are 
observed. 
The IA was to be reviewed based on a Lan-DeMets approach to the O'Brien-Fleming (OBF) alpha-
spending function 
If analysis of OS was statistically significant, the key secondary endpoint PFS was to be analyzed using 
the same statistical method as used in analysis of OS. If analysis of PFS was statistically significant, 
the ORR was to be analyzed. 
The family-wise type I error across the test of primary and key secondary endpoints and the repeated 
testing of OS in the two interim analyses and final analyses in Part 2 was controlled at two-sided 0.05 
level. 
The multiplicity between analyses of OS, PFS, and ORR were to be controlled at two-sided 0.05 level 
by the hierarchical approach.  
The type I error for the two interim analyses of OS at 146 (50%) and 204 (70%) and final analysis of 
OS was controlled at two-sided 0.05 level according to OBF alpha spending function. The exact nominal 
p-values needed to declare statistical significance at the time of these analyses for OS was to depend 
on the actual number of OS events at the time of the analyses. 
All other statistical comparisons were exploratory in nature and, therefore, not controlled for 
multiplicity. 
Changes to the SAP and to planned analyses 
The current SAP is SAP v2, based on the protocol version amendment 5. Changes from version 1 of the 
SAP included:

Results 
A total of 904 patients were screened for study eligibility in Study 16113 Part 2. 438 patients were 
screen failures, reasons detailed in Table 10. 
At data cut-off for the second interim analysis (IA2) on 14-JUN-2021, 466 patients constitute the full 
analysis population (FAS), i.e., PD-L1 all-comers. Since the primary endpoint was met at IA2, this is 
considered the primary analysis. Participant flow is presented in Table 9. 
Results for an updated analysis (data cut-off 14-JUN-2022) are also provided in this report.

312 patients were enrolled in the cemiplimab + chemotherapy arm and 154 in the placebo + 
chemotherapy arm. 
Note: The final indication for cemiplimab + chemotherapy in the first line treatment of non-small cell 
lung cancer includes only patients with tumoural SP263 PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% (n=327, of which 217 
in the cemiplimab + chemotherapy arm and 110 in the placebo + chemotherapy arm). Consequently, 
certain tables present the FAS (PD-L1 all-comers, N=466), while others specify the PD-L1≥1% 
subgroup (n=327).

Treatment beyond progression 
In accordance with Study 16113 Part 2 protocol, for 105 patients randomized to the cemiplimab/chemo 
arm who had BIRC-confirmed disease progression, the Investigators deemed that continuation of the 
same treatment was the preferred option in the patient’s best clinical interest. As per study protocol, 
this evaluation was based on the consideration that 1) the Investigator assessed no rapid disease 
progression, 2) the patient continued to meet all other study eligibility criteria, 3) the patient was 
tolerant of cemiplimab and had a stable performance status, and 4) that treatment beyond progression 
Assessment report

would not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression. Of 
note, the further disease progression was assessed locally by the investigators and not centrally 
reviewed and patient disease was not re-baselined at the time of disease progression. As such, PFS2 
was not included among the secondary or exploratory endpoints of the study and was not evaluated 
for this subgroup of patients and additional post-hoc analysis is not feasible.

Outcomes and estimation 
At IA2, on data cut-off 14-JUN-2021, statistical significance was demonstrated for OS in the FAS (PD-
L1 all-comers) and the IDMC recommended that the study be unblinded. The Sponsor then reproduced 
these analyses and agreed with the IDMC, concluding the study at IA #2 and, as provided in the SAP, 
designating these data as the primary analysis. 
The updated analyses (data cut-off 14-JUN-2022) and efficacy analyses by PD-L1 subgroups are 
presented in the ancillary analyses section.

Waterfall plots of best percent change from baseline illustrate depth of responses in target lesions in 
the cemiplimab/chemo arm (Figure 12) and in the placebo/chemo arm (Figure 13). Each bar 
represents a patient, and BORs are shown according to the color keys in the figures. Depicted BORs in 
waterfall plots did not include any tumour assessments obtained after PD.

Quality of Life (QoL), patient reported outcome (PRO) 
Baseline completion rates for the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 were high, above 97% in all scales. 
Post-baseline completion rates (adjusted for study attrition) were more than 91% through cycle 21 for 
those patients expected to complete the PRO assessment.

In summary, descriptive analysis of patient reported outcomes per EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 
showed that patients in the cemiplimab/chemo arm had numerically similar GHS/QoL, functions and 
symptoms scores compared with patients treated with placebo/chemo.

Supportive study 
As a supplement to the PD-L1 subgroups data, the Applicant presented data that recently became 
available (data cutoff as of 1 Feb 2022) from Study 16113 Part 1, which was carried out in in patients 
whose tumors express PD-L1<50% 
Study 16113 Part 1 was an open-label three-arm study comparing the efficacy and safety of Arm B 
(cemiplimab/chemo) and Arm C (cemiplimab/2 cycles of chemotherapy/ipilimumab) versus Arm A 
(platinum-based doublet chemotherapy) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 in <50% of tumor 
cells.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Based on the results from study R2810-ONC-16113 Part 2 (EMPOWER Lung-3), a phase III, 
multicentre, double blinded, randomised 2:1, placebo controlled double blinded study of 
cemiplimab+chemotherapy vs placebo+chemotherapy as first line treatment of patients with 
metastatic or locally advanced NSCLC, the MAH seeks an extension of indication for this patient group.  
The primary endpoint of the trial was OS and the secondary were ICR-PFS, ICR-ORR, ICR-DoR and QoL 
by PRO. The submitted data was from the second prespecified interim analysis (IA2) and since the 
primary endpoint was met this is considered the primary analysis.  At IA2, on data cut-off 14-JUN-
2021, the median follow-up for the total population was 16.43 months (range: 8.5, 24.0). During the 
procedure, the MAH submitted updated efficacy data (data cut-off 14-JUN-2022), for primary and 
secondary endpoints, from Study 16113 Part 2 with a follow up of 28.4 months.Design and conduct of 
clinical studies 
A number of other studies have investigated the combination of an immune checkpoint inhibitor with 
standard chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC in the first line setting and both 
pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, a PD-1 and a PD-L1 inhibitor respectively, are currently approved 
for this indication in the EU. However, study 16113 Part 2 was the first study planned to include 
patients with both locally advanced (not able to receive definitive chemoradiation treatment) and 
metastatic NSCLC as well as patients with both squamous and non-squamous cell histology, regardless 
of PD-L1 expression. 
The first patient was included in study 16113 at 31st of May 2019. At that timepoint, pembrolizumab+ 
platin-based chemotherapy had proven superior to chemotherapy alone and had been approved as 
first line treatment for advanced non-squamous NSCLC in the EU (October 10th 2018) and prior to that 
(August 2018), for both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC, by the FDA. Therefore, the design of 
the study, especially the choice of treatment in the comparator arm, was discussed with the MAH at 
the Scientific Advice (SA) meeting in October 2018. The CHMP considered that pembrolizumab+platin-
based chemotherapy was a more appropriate comparator to cemiplimab+platin-based chemotherapy 
than placebo+platin-based chemotherapy. Still, the MAH chose to continue with 
placebo+chemotherapy as the comparator, arguing that in the countries study 16113 was conducted 
in, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were not readily available or reimbursed and chemotherapy 
alone (+placebo) would therefore not be considered an inferior treatment.  
Otherwise, study 16113 was well conducted and the results for the overall population were in line with 
those of Keynote-189 and 407. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At IA2, the primary endpoint of OS was met in the ITT (PD-L1 all-comers) population (n=466) with a 
HR of 0.71 (0.53-0.93) and p=0.014, noting 46% of OS maturity (214 events). A remarkable 
difference was observed in median OS, that was 21.9 months (15.5-NE) in the cemiplimab arm 
compared to 13 months (11.9-16.1) in the placebo arm. The secondary endpoints of PFS, ORR and 
DoR were also met in the ITT population. The PFS HR was 0.56 (0.44-0.699) and p<0.0001. Median 
PFS was 8.2 months (6.4-9.3) vs 5 months (4.3-6.2) in the two arms respectively. A noteworthy 
difference in ORR with 43.3% (37.7%-49%) in the cemiplimab arm and 22.7% (16.4%-30.2%) in the 
placebo arm was also registered. Likewise, the difference in median DoR, 15.6 (12.4-NE) vs 7.3 
months (4.3-12.6) favours cemiplimab.

These outcomes support the benefit of addition of cemiplimab to standard chemotherapy. Though, 
from the subgroup analyses the benefit from the addition of cemiplimab to chemotherapy in the PD-L1 
negative patients (<1% expression) is uncertain as the cemiplimab arm performed inferior to the 
placebo arm (OS HR of 1.006 (0.633-1.600), median OS 12.8 months in the cemiplimab arm vs 14.2 
months in the placebo arm, PFS HR of 0.764 (0.509-1.146)).  
In the supplementary data from Part 1 of study 16113, similar results were observed within the PD-L1 
negative patient group with a shorter median OS in the cemiplimab arm than in the placebo arm (OS 
HR 0.863 (0.550, 1.355), median OS 15.5 months in the cemiplimab arm vs 15.8 months in the 
placebo arm, PFS HR of 0.886 (0.574-1.368)). Overall, neither in the initially submitted data from Part 
2 nor in the subsequently provided data from Part 1 was efficacy from added cemiplimab in the PD-L1 
negative patients (PD-L1<1%) considered established and a PD-L1 unrestricted indication was not 
deemed justified. 
During the procedure, the MAH submitted updated results with an additional 12 months of follow up 
from study 16113 Part 2 (DCO 14-JUN-2022). These results showed consistency over time. For all-
comers, with OS maturity of 65% (291 deaths), HR for OS was 0.55 (95% CI 0.44, 0.68). The 
uncertain treatment effect in the PD-L1 negative patient group was consistently present and with 
largely unchanged data outcome [OS HR 0.939 (0.62-1.42)], mOS unchanged 12.8 months in the 
cemiplimab arm vs 14.2 months in the control arm). 
Furthermore, the MAH presented OS, PFS and ORR data (tables and K-M plots) for the two PD-L1 
subgroups: <1% and ≥1% for both initial and updated data of part 2. With regards to the primary 
endpoint of OS, the data confirms that in patients with PD-L1 <1%, the median OS was shorter in the 
cemiplimab arm compared to the placebo arm and that the HRs, and their 95% CI, are reflective 
(distinctly crossing 1) of this finding. The OS K-M curves, for both initial and updated cut-off, for the 
PD-L1 negative (<1%) patients, were superposed curves for the cemiplimab arm and the placebo arm, 
whereas the curves showed a clear separation in the PD-L1 positive (≥1%) patient population. 
In the provided data on the PD-L1 positive (≥1%) patients, the baseline patient and tumour 
characteristics were equivalent to those of the whole ITT population.  
At IA2, the HR for OS in patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 ≥1% was 0.55 (0.39-0.78). The 
median OS was 21.9 months (17.3-NE) in the cemiplimab arm compared to 12.6 months (10.3-16.4) 
in the placebo arm. The PFS HR was 0.48 (0.36-0.63) with a median PFS of 8.5 months (6.7-10.7) vs 
5.5 months (4.3-6.2) in the two arms respectively. A noteworthy difference in ORR with 47.9% (41.1-
54.8) in the cemiplimab arm and 22.7% (15.3-31.7) in the placebo arm was also registered. Likewise, 
the difference in median DoR, 15.6 (1.7-18.7+) vs 4.9 months (1.9-18.8+) favours cemiplimab.  
It was also argued that subgroup analyses from trials Keynote-407, Keynote-189 and IMpower130 did 
not suggest that overall survival, in similar populations, was driven by PD-L1 expression, and thus the 
subgroup of PD-L1 <1% patients also showed efficacy benefits in terms of survival. However, 
published results of the chemotherapy + anti-PD-L1 agent arm from other trials in the same setting, 
namely IMpower150 (Socinski et al, Journal of Thoracic Oncology 2021) and Poseidon (Johnson et al, 
JCO 2022) showed outcomes comparable to that of Study 16113 Part 2: HR for OS closely approaching 
1 in the PD-L1 <1% subgroup. As discussed above, the external evidence does not consistently show a 
benefit from the addition of anti PD-1/PD-L1 to chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 negative tumours 
and despite the limitations of subgroup analyses, the data available support a restriction of indication 
to patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 (in ≥ 1% of tumour cells).

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Cemiplimab in combination with standard chemotherapy for either non-squamous or squamous cell 
histology showed efficacy in patients with locally advanced (not candidates for definitive 
chemoradiation) or metastatic NSCLC in first line treatment in the ITT population with regards to the 
primary endpoint of OS and the secondary endpoints of PFS, ORR and DoR. Nevertheless, within the 
subgroup of PD-L1 negative patients (<1% expression), the OS and PFS data suggested uncertain 
benefit from the addition of cemiplimab, also after additional 12 months of follow-up time, justifying 
that these patients are excluded from the sought indication. Hence, the data did not support an 
indication statement regardless of PD-L1 expression and despite an oral explanation from the MAH, the 
CHMP considered by majority that efficacy of cemiplimab as addition to platinum-based chemotherapy 
was only established in patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 ≥1%. 
2.5.  Clinical safety

Post marketing experience 
Cemiplimab/chemo combination therapy is not yet approved. 
Cemiplimab monotherapy is approved in several countries worldwide for the treatment of adult 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or 
curative radiation. Cemiplimab is also approved in some countries for BCC, first line treatment of 
NSCLC and cervical cancer. Cumulatively up to 27 Mar 2021, a total of 3945 patients (3349 patients 
from Regeneron studies and 596 patients from non-Regeneron sponsored studies) have been treated 
with investigational cemiplimab monotherapy, combination therapy, or comparator product in multiple 
clinical trials. The cumulative exposure to cemiplimab in clinical studies is estimated to be 
97,072 patient-weeks (82,266 patient-weeks in Regeneron studies and 14,806 patient-weeks in non-
Regeneron studies).

Based on the sales figures through 31 Mar 2021, the global cumulative exposure to cemiplimab 
monotherapy was estimated to be 6484 patient-years. 
The list of important identified risks for cemiplimab described in the Periodic Safety Update Report are 
Immune-related adverse reactions and Infusion-related reactions. The important potential risks for 
cemiplimab are lack of effect due to ADA and embryo-fetal toxicity. The missing information for 
cemiplimab are long-term safety data, use in pregnant women and use in breastfeeding women. 
Since initial approval in the US in September 2018, no new safety concerns/important risks were 
identified from post-marketing data for cemiplimab monotherapy. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety is based on data from 465 patients, of which 312 patients were treated with 
platinum-based doublet chemo and cemiplimab in the pivotal study 16113 Part 2 per data cut-off of 14 
June 2021. The provided size of the safety data base is acceptable for an assessment of cemiplimab + 
platinum-based chemotherapy (n=312) although no other combination therapy regimens have been 
approved with cemiplimab. The median duration of exposure was 38.5 weeks (10 days to 102.6 
weeks) in the cemiplimab/chemo arm compared to 21.3 weeks (4 days to 95 weeks) in the 
placebo/chemo arm and the majority of the patients in the cemiplimab/chemo arm (71.8%) had been 
treated for at least 24 weeks while 38.1% had been treated for ≥48 weeks. 
Almost all of the patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) in the pivotal study and the 
most frequently observed events were (cemiplimab/chemo vs placebo/chemo): Anaemia (43.6% vs 
39.9%), alopecia (36.9% vs 43.1%), nausea (25.0% vs 16.3%), hyperglycaemia (17.6% vs 11.8%), 
decreased appetite (17.0% vs 11.8%), alanine aminotransferase increased (16.3% vs 14.4%), 
neutropenia (15.4% vs 12.4%), and arthralgia (15.4% vs 13.1%). The most commonly observed 
grade ≥3 AEs by PT (≥2% of patients) were: Anaemia (9.9% vs 6.5%), neutropenia (5.8% vs 5.9%), 
white blood cell count decreased (3.2% vs 2.0%), pneumonia (2.9% vs 3.3%), thrombocytopenia 
(2.6% vs 1.3%), alanine aminotransferase increased (2.2% vs 2.0%), fatigue (2.2% vs 0.7%), and 
dyspnoea (2.2% vs 0.7%).  
Treatment-related AE’s were similar to the AEs observed, and the most commonly observed of all 
grades were: Anaemia (40.7% vs 34.0%), alopecia (36.5% vs 42.5%), and nausea (22.8% vs 
16.3%); while the most common grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs were: Anaemia (9.6% vs 6.5%), 
neutropenia (5.4% vs 5.9%), and white blood cell count decreased (3.2% vs 1.3%). It is noted that 
increased haematological toxicity led to a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in the 
cemiplimab/chemo arm (1.3% vs 2.6%), but it is within an acceptable level and the ADRs are 
considered manageable. 
Most patients had changes in haematology parameters from baseline and this was slightly more 
commonly observed for the cemiplimab + chemo group both regarding all grade toxicities (87.6% vs 
82.2%) and grade 3 or 4 events (21.7% vs 16.4%), which is acceptable. The incidence of affected 
electrolytes was also increased in the cemiplimab + chemo groups regarding all grade events (85.6% 
vs 74.7%); however, the high grade 3-4 events were evenly distributed and the changes are 
considered manageable. A higher incidence of liver function laboratory abnormalities was observed for 
the cemiplimab/chemo arm (75.6% vs 63.7%), and grade 3-4 events were also more common (5.0% 
vs 3.4%). Increased AST of all grades were very commonly observed in both treatment groups (40.1% 
vs 27.4%), even though it is noted that grade 3-4 events were less common in the cemiplimab arm 
compared to the placebo arm(0.3% vs 2.1%). The Applicant has clarified that the slightly higher 
incidence of liver function abnormalities can be attributed to medical history of increased enzymes at 
baseline; since 4.8% of patients had ALT increased in the cemiplimab/chemo arm compared to 2.0% in

the placebo/chemo arm and 2.9% of patients had AST increased in the cemiplimab/chemo arm at 
baseline compared to none in the placebo/chemo arm. This is considered plausible. Overall, the 
differences in laboratory tests are considered manageable and acceptable. 
Adverse events of special interest included infusion-related reactions and immune-related adverse 
events as they are important identified risks with cemiplimab. Only 2.2% of the safety population 
(n=312) had an infusion-related reactions which is considered acceptable and manageable. Immune-
related adverse events were commonly observed (18.9%), but these events were rarely of high grade 
(≥grade 3: 2.9%) and the most frequently observed were hypothyroidism (7.7%), hyperthyroidism 
(5.1%), blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased (4.2%) or decreased (1.6%), and pneumonitis 
(1.6%). Only 1.0% of the patients discontinued treatment due to Immune-Mediated Adverse Events 
(imAEs) and 1 (0.3%) patient died from pneumonitis. However, the overall incidence of immune-
related adverse events is acceptable and considered manageable, considering the underlying lung 
cancer disease.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed in a quarter of the patients (25.3% vs 22.2%) in the 
cemiplimab/chemo arm vs the placebo/chemo groups, most often pertaining to pneumonia (2.9 % vs 
2.0%) and anaemia (2.9% vs 1.3%), and febrile neutropenia (1.3% vs 2.6%). Hence, there were 
more serious toxicities observed in the cemiplimab-containing arm compared to the placebo-containing 
arm but this was within an acceptable range. 
Overall, there was an equal fraction of deaths in both groups (~25%) and the patients most 
commonly died due to disease progression (~17%). A similar fraction died due to AEs in both groups 
and of these, 1.3% (4/312) died of treatment-related AEs (general physical health deterioration, 
mesenteric artery thrombosis, and pneumonitis) in the cemiplimab/chemo arm compared to 0.7% of 
the patients in the placebo/chemo arms (enterocolitis). The narratives for these deaths have been 
reviewed and it is agreed that there was only one death related to treatment with cemiplimab in this 
safety population; i.e. the one patient (0.3%) who died from pneumonitis. 
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs were higher in the cemiplimab + chemo group than for 
the placebo + cemiplimab group (5.1% vs 2.6%). Hence, the addition of cemiplimab increased the rate 
of discontinuations, but this is considered within an acceptable range considering the treated and 
targeted disease of advanced lung cancer. 
Subgroup analyses indicating higher toxicity was observed in the >65-year old patients regarding 
grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to death, but the difference was not large and was within an 
acceptable range. It is noted that there was no clear trend toward more discontinuations due to AEs 
with age. Moreover, the safety profile according to histology showed that patients with squamous 
histology, who received cemiplimab + chemo had significantly fewer serious adverse events (SAEs) 
than patients with non-squamous histology 18.8% vs 30.2%). This can be explained by the use of 
maintenance pemetrexed in patients with non-squamous histology and increased use of the more toxic 
cisplatin versus carboplatin-based chemotherapy.  
The section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated to reflect the safety profile of cemiplimab in combination 
with platinum
based chemotherapy. Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in 18.9% of 
patients including Grade 5 (0.3%), Grade 3 (2.6%), and Grade 2 (7.4%). Immune-mediated adverse 
‐
reactions led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 1.0% of patients. The most common 
immune-mediated adverse reactions were hypothyroidism (7.7%), hyperthyroidism (5.1%), increased 
blood thyroid stimulating hormone (4.2%), immune-mediated skin reaction (1.9%), immune-mediated 
pneumonitis (1.9%), and decreased blood thyroid stimulating hormone (1.6%). 
No changes to the safety concerns and risk minimisation measures in the RMP were deemed 
necessary.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The addition of cemiplimab to 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy compared to placebo + 
chemotherapy showed overall increased toxicity, especially haematological, immune-mediated adverse 
events and more discontinuations due to adverse events. However, no new safety signals were 
observed, and the safety profile of the combination therapy is acceptable considering the treated and 
targeted disease of advanced lung cancer.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to 
reflect the addition of the new therapeutic indication to include LIBTAYO in combination with 
platinum‐based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced 
NSCLC who are not candidates for definitive chemoradiation or metastatic NSCLC expressing PD-L1 (in 
≥ 1% of tumour cells), with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated 
accordingly.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The proposed changes to the package leaflet related to this new indication are minimal and it is 
consequently agreed that a separate user consultation with target patient groups is not required. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication is for LIBTAYO in combination with platinum
treatment of adult patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 (in ≥ 1% of tumour cells), with no EGFR, ALK 
based chemotherapy for the first
line 
‐
‐
or ROS1 aberrations, who have: 
• 
• 
locally advanced NSCLC who are not candidates for definitive chemoradiation or 
metastatic NSCLC. 
The aim of added cemiplimab in the targeted population is to prolong overall survival (OS) and 
improve progression-free survival (PFS). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the 1st line treatment for the patient group encompassed by the sought indication the recommended 
treatments are a combination of platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, in 
some cases with added anti-CTLA-4 agents or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as monotherapy for patients 
with high PD-L1 expression (ESMO 2023). All the approved combinations of platinum-based 
chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced NSCLC encompass the metastatic 
setting only, so an unmet medical need for patients with locally advanced disease (often stage IIIB) 
that cannot receive definite chemoradiation exists. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main study for the current application, study R2810 ONC 16113 Part 2 (EMPOWER-Lung 3) is a 
global, randomised (2:1), phase III, double blinded study aiming to show a difference in OS by the 
addition of cemiplimab to standard chemotherapy. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study 16113 Part 2 met its primary endpoint of OS in the ITT (PD-L1 unselected) population (n=466) 
with a HR of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.53-0.93) and p=0.014 at the second pre-planned interim analysis (IA2) 
with a data cut-off of June 14th 2021 and OS maturity of 46%. The median follow-up for the total 
population was 16.43 months (range: 8.5, 24.0). There was a clear difference in median OS of 21.9 
months (15.5-NE) in the cemiplimab+chemotherapy arm vs 13 months (11.9-16.1) in the 
placebo+chemotherapy arm. The secondary endpoints of PFS, ORR and DoR were also met in the ITT

population. The PFS HR was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.44-0.699), p<0.0001 and the difference in median PFS 
of 8.2 months (95% CI: 6.4-9.3) vs 5 months (95% CI: 4.3-6.2) is considered clinically meaningful.  
The updated efficacy data with a follow up of 28.4 months showed consistency over time. When 
excluding patients with PD-L1 expression <1%, the median OS was 21.9 months (95% CI: 17.3, NE) 
in the cemiplimab arm vs 12.6 months (95% CI: 10.3, 16.4) in the placebo arm. The median PFS was 
8.5 months (95% CI: 6.7-10.7) in the cemiplimab arm vs 5.5 months (95% CI: 4.3-6.2) in the 
placebo arm  with a HR of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.36-0.63). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Subgroup analyses indicated that patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1% were the main driver of benefit 
in terms of OS and PFS both in the primary and updated efficacy datasets. 
The PD-L1<1% subpopulation was constituted by nearly a third of the ITT (139 patients, 30%), and 
the benefit from adding cemiplimab to chemotherapy in these patients was uncertain, as a lower 
median OS was reported in the cemiplimab arm compared to the placebo arm in the primary analysis: 
OS HR of 1.006 (0.633-1.600), median OS 12.8 months in the cemiplimab arm vs 14.2 months in the 
placebo arm. Updated results confirmed this trend, noting HR for OS at 0.939 (0.62-1.42) in this 
subgroup. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost all of the patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) in the pivotal study and the 
most frequently observed events were (cemiplimab/chemo vs placebo/chemo): Anaemia (43.6% vs 
39.9%), alopecia (36.9% vs 43.1%), nausea (25.0% vs 16.3%), hyperglycaemia (17.6% vs 11.8%), 
decreased appetite (17.0% vs 11.8%), alanine aminotransferase increased (16.3% vs 14.4%), 
neutropenia (15.4% vs 12.4%), and arthralgia (15.4% vs 13.1%). The most commonly observed 
grade ≥3 AEs by PT (≥2% of patients) were: Anaemia (9.9% vs 6.5%), neutropenia (5.8% vs 5.9%), 
white blood cell count decreased (3.2% vs 2.0%), pneumonia (2.9% vs 3.3%), thrombocytopenia 
(2.6% vs 1.3%), alanine aminotransferase increased (2.2% vs 2.0%), fatigue (2.2% vs 0.7%), and 
dyspnoea (2.2% vs 0.7%).  
Treatment-related AEs were similar to the AEs observed, and the most commonly observed of all 
grades were: Anaemia (40.7% vs 34.0%), alopecia (36.5% vs 42.5%), and nausea (22.8% vs 
16.3%); while the most common grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs were: Anaemia (9.6% vs 6.5%), 
neutropenia (5.4% vs 5.9%), and white blood cell count decreased (3.2% vs 1.3%). It is noted that 
increased haematological toxicity led to a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in the 
cemiplimab/chemo arm (1.3% vs 2.6%). 
The incidence of affected electrolytes was also increased in the cemiplimab + chemo groups regarding 
all grade events (85.6% vs 74.7%); however, the high grade 3-4 events were evenly distributed.  
Adverse events of special interest included infusion-related reactions and immune-related adverse 
events (imAE) as they are important identified risks with cemiplimab. Only 2.2% of the safety 
population (n=312) had an infusion-related reactions. Immune-related adverse events were commonly 
observed (18.9%), but these events were rarely of high grade (≥grade 3: 2.9%) and the most 
frequently observed were hypothyroidism (7.7%), hyperthyroidism (5.1%), blood thyroid stimulating 
hormone increased (4.2%) or decreased (1.6%), and pneumonitis (1.6%). Only 1.0% of the patients 
discontinued treatment due to imAEs.  
Assessment report

Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed in a quarter of the patients (25.3% vs 22.2%) in the 
cemiplimab/chemo arm vs the placebo/chemo groups, most often pertaining to pneumonia (2.9 % vs 
2.0%) and anaemia (2.9% vs 1.3%), and as mentioned febrile neutropenia (1.3% vs 2.6%).  
Overall, there was an equal fraction of deaths in both groups (~25%) and the patients most 
commonly died due to disease progression (~17%). Importantly, although a similar fraction died due 
to AE in both groups and of these, 1.3% (4/312) died of treatment-related AEs (general physical 
health deterioration, mesenteric artery thrombosis, and pneumonitis) in the cemiplimab/chemo arm 
compared to 0.7% of the patients in the placebo/chemo arms (enterocolitis). The narratives for these 
deaths have been reviewed and it is agreed that there were only one death related to treatment with 
cemiplimab in this safety population; i.e. the one patient (0.3%) who died from pneumonitis. 
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs were higher in the cemiplimab + chemo group than for 
the placebo + cemiplimab group (5.1% vs 2.6%).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and lung cancer patients in need of 
treatment options are abundant. It is therefore of great importance, that multiple treatment options 
exist.  
In study 16113 Part 2, the addition of cemiplimab to standard chemotherapy as 1st line treatment of 
advanced NSCLC proved to prolong overall survival and progression free survival significantly and this 
is considered clinically relevant. 
Study 16113 Part 2 was the first study to include and establish benefit from the addition of cemiplimab 
(an ICI) to chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced as well as metastatic disease and in 
patients with both squamous and non-squamous cell histology in one trial. However, in the subgroup 
of patients who were PD-L1 negative (<1%) the uncertain benefit from the addition of cemiplimab to 
chemotherapy does not outweigh the added toxicity and this patient group has been excluded from the 
indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC.  
Regarding safety, the addition of cemiplimab to 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy compared to 
placebo + chemotherapy showed overall increased toxicity, especially haematological, immune-
mediated adverse events and more discontinuations due to adverse events. However, no new safety 
signals are observed, and the safety profile of the combination therapy is acceptable considering the 
treated and targeted disease of advanced lung cancer. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The balance of benefits and risks is positive as the demonstrated gains from the addition of cemiplimab 
to platinum-based chemotherapy regarding OS and PFS are significant and considered clinically 
relevant and meaningful.  
The overall effect in the ITT population is considered driven by the stratified subgroup of patient with 
PD-L1 ≥ 1%, for whom a relevant and significant improvement in PFS and OS is observed. in patients 
with tumoural PD-L1 expression While the overall safety profile of the combination is deemed 
manageable, the uncertain efficacy in the PD-L1 negative (<1%) population of adding cemiplimab to 
chemotherapy, does not outweigh the additional toxicity that these patients are exposed to. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of cemiplimab for the intended extension of indication is currently negative due to a  
major objection that concerns the indication statement.  
The overall B/R of Libtayo in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy is positive for the first‐
line treatment of adult patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 (in ≥ 1% of tumour cells), with no 
EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations, who have: 
• 
locally advanced NSCLC who are not candidates for definitive chemoradiation, or

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 23 February 2023 
LIBTAYO EMEA/H/C/004844/II/0028 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  of  LIBTAYO  indicated  for  LIBTAYO  in  combination  with 
platinum‐based chemotherapy is indicated for the first‐line treatment of adult patients with NSCLC 
expressing PD-L1 (in ≥ 1% of tumour cells), with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations, who have: 
• 
• 
locally advanced NSCLC who are not candidates for definitive chemoradiation or 
metastatic NSCLC. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
The  restriction  of  the  1L  locally  advanced/metastatic  NSCLC  indication  for  Libtayo  as  add-on  to 
chemotherapy, to patients with tumour PD-L1 expression >1% is not agreed.  
The  1L  NSCLC  indication  is  based  on  a  pivotal  study  including  all-comers  with  respect  to  PD-L1 
expression. This has robustly demonstrated an OS advantage in its ITT population (HR 0.71; p=0.01)  
The  most  mature  data  update  show  that  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  PD-L1  expression  <1% 
(N=139), the OS HR is 0.94, with a broad 95% confidence interval ranging from 0.61-1.42. Due to 
the  low  number  of  events,  no  independent  inference  of  efficacy  can  be  made  in  the  PD-L1  <1% 
subgroup based on the OS metric. 
However, in the context of an overall positive study, efficacy in this subgroup is supported by a trend 
towards a PFS gain (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.5-1.08) together with an increase in ORR over chemotherapy 
alone  (34%  versus  20%).  Thus,  the  antitumoral  activity  of  cemiplimab  in  low  PD-L1  expressors  is 
evident.   
Moreover,  external  evidence  supports  the  benefit  of  PD-1/PD-L1  targeting  drugs  as  add-on  to 
chemotherapy for the 1L treatment of metastatic NSCLC regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression. 
Indeed,  for  none  of  the  other  products  in  this  drug  class,  has  the  CHMP  restricted  add-on  use  in 
metastatic NSCLC to patients with higher PD-L1 expression. 
While  the  addition  of  cemiplimab  to  platinum‐based  chemotherapy  does  increase  toxicity,  this  is 
moderate and manageable.  
In  summary,  available  evidence  supports  efficacy  and  a  positive  B/R  for  Libtayo  as  add  on  to

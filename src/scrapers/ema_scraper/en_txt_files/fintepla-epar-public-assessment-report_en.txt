2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Fintepla (fenfluramine hydrochloride) is proposed for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet 
Syndrome (DS) in patients from 2 years of age and older. 
DS is a rare disease and sufficient seizure control may be difficult to achieve with existing therapies. There is 
therefore a need for new therapies with a different mode of action. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Dravet Syndrome: Incidence approximately 1:20,000 births. Prevalence estimates uncertain possibly around 
3/100,000. DS is believed to account for approximately 7% of all severe epilepsies starting before the age of 
3 years. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Between 70% and 80% of DS patients carry sodium channel α1 subunit gene (SCN1A) abnormalities. 
Truncating mutations account for about 40%. Other SCN1A mutations comprise splice-site and missense 
mutations, most of which fall into the pore-forming region of the sodium channel. Mutations are randomly 
distributed across the SCN1A protein. Most mutations are de novo, but familial SCN1A mutations also occur. 
The aetiology of about 20% of DS patients remains unknown, and additional genes are likely to be 
implicated. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Dravet Syndrome, also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, is characterised by a variety of 
seizures (febrile and afebrile, generalized and unilateral, clonic or tonic–clonic) that occur in the first year of 
life. The onset is usually between 4 and 8 months of age, and often triggered by fever. In addition to 
convulsive seizures, other seizure types appear between the ages of 1 and 4 years, including myoclonic 
seizures, focal seizures, and atypical absences. Status epilepticus (SE) may occur at initial presentation or 
later in the clinical course. By late childhood, the seizure profile will often have stabilised. Significant 
developmental delay becomes apparent from the second year onwards and associated neuropsychological 
disturbances, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, are common. Intellectual impairment affects 
nearly all patients and is severe in 50% of cases. Dependency in adulthood is common. Death during 
childhood is common and may be due to SE, drowning or accidents. 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 12/101 
 
  
  
 
2.1.5.  Management 
Stiripentol (STP, trade name Diacomit), taken in conjunction with sodium valproate (VPA) or clobazam (CLB), 
is currently approved in the Europe for the treatment of DS. Since September 2019, Epidyolex (cannabidiol) 
taken with clobazam has been authorised throughout the Europe for the treatment of DS. Neither VPA nor 
CLB are approved for DS specifically, but both are approved for use in epilepsy in the EU, and widely used. 
VPA is often used to prevent the initial recurrence of convulsive seizures, and benzodiazepines (e.g. 
diazepam, midazolam, clonazepam, or CLB) are frequently co-administered to limit the duration of long-
lasting seizures. Second line treatments and other options in DS typically include STP, topiramate, ketogenic 
diet, levetiracetam (LEV), bromides, and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Polytherapy is common. Of note, 
patients with DS may be prone to seizure exacerbation with sodium channel modulators such as 
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, LTG, phenytoin, and vigabatrin. 
Sufficient seizure control may be difficult to achieve, and there is therefore a need for new therapies with a 
different mode of action. 
About the product 
Fenfluramine is a racemic compound containing dexfenfluramine and levofenfluramine. The active 
pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is fenfluramine hydrochloride (HCl). The intended commercial formulation is 
an oral, aqueous solution at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL fenfluramine HCl (equivalent to 2.2 mg/mL 
fenfluramine). Fenfluramine HCl is a highly soluble substance and is expected to remain soluble in the 
gastrointestinal tract. 
Fenfluramine was approved in Europe in the 1960s, and in the United States in the 1970s as an appetite 
suppressant at a dose of 60 to 120 mg/day for the treatment of adult obesity. Fenfluramine was used 
extensively in an off-label combination with phentermine. The d (or (+)) isomer of fenfluramine 
(dexfenfluramine) was also approved and marketed (Adifax®, Redux® and others) as an anorectic 
medication. Fenfluramine (racemate) was sold in 118 countries and was in clinical use for 20 to 30 years. 
Approximately 50 million Europeans were treated with fenfluramine for appetite suppression between 1963 
and 1996 (Barceloux 2012) and the US Department of Health and Human Services estimated an exposure of 
over 61 million patient-months prior to its global withdrawal in 1997 (Lee/DHHS 1994). 
In the late 1990s, fenfluramine was withdrawn from world-wide markets due to its association with cardiac 
valve abnormalities (CDC 1997; Connolly 1997; Wong 1998). In its review in 1999, the EMA considered the 
safety profile of fenfluramine for the treatment of obesity unacceptable under prescribed conditions of use 
and the benefit/risk balance unfavourable. 
Subsequently, however, open-label long-term studies (representing up to approximately 30 years of daily 
treatment) in Belgium suggested efficacy of fenfluramine hydrochloride in controlling seizures in patients with 
Dravet Syndrome. A total of 21 patients from 6 months to 50 years of age were followed after the product's 
withdrawal from the market.  The doses used were administered as fixed doses between 5 and 40 mg/day 
fenfluramine hydrochloride, most commonly 5 or 10 mg twice a day. These doses corresponded to 
approximately 0.8 to 1.0 mg/kg/day for young children, and 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/day for the older patients. The 
results were regarded as promising with respect to efficacy and safety. 
The proposed indication for Fintepla is for the treatment, as an add-on therapy to other antiepileptic 
medicines, of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older. The doses are 
0.2 to 0.7 mg/kg/day fenfluramine administered orally in 2 divided doses (BID), with a maximum total daily 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 13/101 
 
  
  
dose of 26 mg, regardless of weight. For patients concomitantly taking stiripentol (with clobazam and/or 
valproate), a modification in the maximum daily dose to 0.4 mg/kg/day, not to exceed a total daily dose of 
17 mg, is recommended. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested an accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product 
was not considered to be of major public health interest, for the following reasons: 
Whilst the unmet medical need for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome is 
acknowledged, the CHMP concluded that the strength of evidence presented in the request for accelerated 
assessment prevented the granting of a positive decision. In particular, the clinical evidence regarding the 
efficacy of fenfluramine in the clinical studies is not outstanding when compared to other available treatment 
options/standard of care including stiripentol. In addition, the safety profile of fenfluramine is known for the 
risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. These risks are known to be cumulative 
and it is expected that the standard assessment time would be required to support the thorough assessment 
and discussions needed in the context of the new intended indication of treatment of Dravet syndrome.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of fenfluramine hydrochloride is (RS)-ethyl(α-methyl-3-trifluoromethylphenethyl)amine 
hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula C12H16F3N • HCl. It has a molecular mass of 267.72 
g/mol and the following structure: 
Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of fenfluramine hydrochloride was elucidated by a combination of Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet (UV) 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS) and elemental analysis. 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hygroscopicity by vapor sorption. 
Fenfluramine hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder. The active substance is 
non-hygroscopic. The active substance aqueous solubility varies moderately as a function of pH.  
Fenfluramine exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of a single chiral centre. Fenfluramine 
hydrochloride has been developed as a racemic mixture and contains equal amounts of dexfenfluramine and 
levofenfluramine. The chiral carbon does not bear acidic protons and is therefore stable to racemization. The 
racemic mixture of R/S fenfluramine has been verified using chiral high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) analysis. The chiral stability of the active substance was also demonstrated by testing samples from 
active substance approximately 1-3 years after manufacture as well as forced degradation study samples. 
Fenfluramine hydrochloride is a crystalline material that exists as a single form (Form 1) with a needle-like 
morphology. The active substance is chemically and physically stable in the solid state and no other 
polymorphs have been observed in a polymorph screening study or in the accelerated and long-term stability 
studies. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Fenfluramine hydrochloride is obtained from a single manufacturer. The active substance is synthesized in 
four main steps followed by crystallisations and salt formation steps using a single well-defined commercially 
available starting material with acceptable specifications. Three synthesis intermediates are isolated. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances.

Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Changes introduced have been presented in enough detail and have been justified. The quality of the active 
substance used in the various phases of the development is considered comparable with that produced by the 
proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in heat-sealed linear-low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) film sleeves as the 
primary packaging which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The primary 
packaging  is  then  placed  inside  a  LDPE  bag  as  secondary  packaging  which  is  secured  with  a  cable  tie.  The 
double bags are placed inside a suitable size HDPE keg. The keg is sealed with a HDPE lid and rubber ‘O’ ring. 
Specification 
The active substance specification shown includes tests for: appearance, identification (FTIR, XRPD, of 
chloride), water content (KF), chloride content (titration), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (HS 
GC), impurities (HPLC) and assay (HPLC). 
As described above, several polymorph screens have resulted in only one polymorph ever observed, and 
generation of amorphous material was not possible. The current proposed specifications use XRPD to identify 
the active substance crystalline form (Form 1), and potential polymorphism is monitored during stability. No 
changes are expected nor have any been observed under long-term and accelerated stability studies. 
The proposed specification for 4-fenfluramine is supported by toxicology data. 
The level of impurities in the active substance was found to be very low and the applicant was requested to 
tighten the proposed limit to reflect batch results. Since the number of batches manufactured at the time of 
opinion is very limited, the applicant committed to re-evaluate it post-approval (see recommendation below). 
As indicated above, fenfluramine is a chiral racemic drug being developed as an equal mixture of (R) and (S) 
enantiomers.  
Elemental impurity limits have been omitted from the active substance specification based on data from 
active substance and finished product batches, and the low content of active substance in the finished 
product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on active substance batches manufactured by the development and clinical-stage 
manufacturer and the intended commercial manufacturer of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed commercial 
manufacturer stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 36 
months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 16/101 
 
  
  
Supportive stability data on active substance manufactured by the development supplier and by the intended 
commercial supplier are also available for up to 48 months at 25°C/60%RH and 6 months at 40°C/75%RH.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identification (XRPD), DSC, water content, impurities, 
assay and microbial testing. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating. 
All tested parameters met the proposed specifications and no trends were observed. Additionally, there were 
no single impurities exceeding the ICH Q3A identification threshold of 0.10%, and none trending at the 
0.05% reporting level observed at any time point. 
Forced degradation studies have been performed under heat (7 days, 80°C), heat and humidity (7 days, 
80°C / 80% RH), heat (solution for 48 hours, 80°C), photolytic stress (solid and in solution), acid (48 hours, 
80°C, 2M HCl), base (48 hours, 80°C, 2M NaOH) and peroxide (14 days, ambient, 3% H2O2). The results 
suggest that fenfluramine is very stable to all stress conditions examined. Impurities were only formed under 
oxidative conditions (~3% peroxide, 25°C, 14 days), resulting in a 2% area loss of parent. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on a single batch. The active substance 
is photostable. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 4 years with no special storage conditions in 
the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Fintepla solution for oral administration is a clear, colourless, slightly viscous liquid, with a pH of 5. It 
contains 2.2 mg/mL fenfluramine (equivalent to 2.5 mg/mL fenfluramine hydrochloride) in aqueous vehicle. 
During the evaluation, a major objection was raised on the expression of strength of the product, proposed to 
be based on hydrochloride salt. As a result, the product information was amended during the procedure and 
the proposed posology in the SmPC is now based on the approved product strength of Fintepla, i.e. 2.2 
mg/mL fenfluramine (the active moiety). 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to produce a liquid formulation for oral administration, with a 
single concentration of fenfluramine hydrochloride that is suitable for paediatric and adult use across the 
entire dosing range and is stored in a multi-use bottle at room temperature. 
The physicochemical properties of fenfluramine hydrochloride active substance are summarized here. 
As indicated in the active substance section, fenfluramine hydrochloride is a crystalline material that exists as 
a single form (Form 1). The active substance is chemically and physically stable in the solid state and no 
other polymorphs have been observed in a polymorph screening study or in the accelerated and long-term 
stability studies. 
The active substance aqueous solubility varies moderately as a function of pH. At 25°C, the solubility ranges 
from approximately 25 mg/mL at pH 1.7 to over 50 mg/mL at pH 6.7. With solubility of more than 10-fold 
higher than its concentration in the finished product, precipitation of the active substance out of solution is

EMA/639853/2020 
Page 17/101 
 
  
  
unlikely to occur under normal storage conditions, including long-term refrigeration Fenfluramine 
hydrochloride active substance is non-micronized.  
Forced degradation studies indicated the active substance is very stable in aqueous solution. Thermal stability 
of buffered aqueous solutions of fenfluramine hydrochloride ranging from 0.5 mg/mL to 5 mg/mL 
concentration was investigated during early development. The data show that fenfluramine hydrochloride 
solution is stable for at least 6 months when stored at 60ºC at pH 6.8. 
The excipients in fenfluramine oral solution formulation include preservatives, viscosity building agent, 
sweetener, buffering agents and a flavouring agent. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients 
and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards, when applicable. The applicant was requested to 
replace the proposed identification test included in the cherry flavouring specification by a more 
discriminative test. Since this has not been addressed at the time of opinion and does not constitute a major 
concern, the applicant is recommended to address this issue post-approval. He has committed to implement 
the new identification test no later than the end of 1st Quarter 2021. 
The excipients levels in the formulation  comply with the Annex to the European Commission guideline on 
‘Excipients in the labelling and packaging leaflet of medicinal products for human use’ 
(EMA/CHMP/302620/2017) and Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use 
(EMEA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev 2) via oral route. Natural flavouring preparations, a component of the 
cherry flavouring powder meets the definition for “Flavouring Preparations under EU Regulation (EC) No 
1334/2008. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Methylparaben is a preservative commonly used in multiple-use oral, topical and injectable pharmaceutical 
formulations, both as free acid and sodium salt and exhibits its antimicrobial activity in the pH range of 4-8. 
Paraben preservatives are typically used in combination due to the known synergy in their antimicrobial 
effects. Methylparaben sodium is used in the formulation, in combination with ethylparaben sodium). These 
preservative levels were selected based on data from preservative efficacy testing. A lower concentration was 
also evaluated in the study.   A weakness was consistently observed in the low-level preservative prototypes 
with respect to fungal species which suggested that these prototypes may not be able to retain adequate 
preservation efficacy by the end of their projected shelf-life or intended in-use period. This weakness 
continued on long-term stability of the low preservative prototypes, failing to meet Ph. Eur. 5.1.3 acceptance 
criteria after 6 months stability storage. Methylparaben concentration in Fintepla is within the range used in 
EU authorised oral pharmaceutical products.  
Methylparaben sodium has a higher aqueous solubility than the free acid and was found to dissolve more 
rapidly in the finished product formulation.  
Ethylparaben was selected for use as the second paraben preservative in fenfluramine oral solution due to its 
higher aqueous solubility compared to the more commonly used propylparaben, since the parabens’ aqueous 
solubility decreases with the chain length. 
The sodium salt of both parabens was selected to minimize the risk of preservative precipitation if the 
product is inadvertently stored at cold temperatures for an extended period of time. With the sodium salts of 
methyl- and ethylparaben (in combination), no sign of precipitation was observed in the finished product 
formulation after one month of storage at 5°C during early development.  
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020

The pH of the finished product formulation was optimized to minimize the preservative degradation (which 
was observed at high pH). The performance of the preservative system in the finished product formulation 
was confirmed using compendial preservative efficacy testing (Ph. Eur. 5.1.3) for oral products. 
The guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use was considered when selecting 
the dosage form and formulation components. 
An aqueous oral solution is generally considered an acceptable dosage form for children as young as 
newborns. The liquid dosage form provides flexibility for age-based or weight-based dosing. The target range 
of dose volumes (0.5 mL to 6 mL) is small enough for administering to young children without compromising 
accuracy of dose measurement. 
Compared to other paediatric oral dosage forms (suspensions, dispersible powders or granules and orally 
disintegrating tablets), oral solutions have the lowest risk of choking and aspiration due to the absence of 
solid particles. 
An oral solution is also most likely to be compatible with gastric and naso-gastric tube administration. 
Unlike oil-based formulations, aqueous solutions generally have acceptable mouth feel, similar to familiar 
water-based drinks. 
Aqueous formulations in multi-dose containers require preservation against microbial growth. 
Although the active substance is stable across a wide range of pH, a buffering system is required to maintain 
the pH at an adequate range for preservatives efficacy, solubility and stability. 
The finished product is sweetened and flavoured to improve acceptability by paediatric patients by masking 
potential objectionable taste from the active and/or other formulation components, such as preservatives, 
and the saline taste from the buffering salt. The levels of flavour and sweetener are relatively low, sufficient 
to achieve the desired taste masking without making the product too attractive to children. This is supported 
by data from the palatability study. 
A thickener is added to increase the viscosity of the liquid formulation and reduce the potential for accidental 
spillage, allow for accurate delivery using an oral syringe (no dripping), and potentially improve palatability of 
the formulation by reducing the contact area with the tongue. 
With regards to the formulation development, fenfluramine hydrochloride concentrations between 0.5 and 5 
mg/mL were initially evaluated. For accuracy of dose measurement and ease of administration, 2.2 mg/mL 
was selected as the target concentration for the intended commercial product since it results in dosing 
volumes of not less than 0.5 mL per dose and not more than 6 mL per dose. 
Given the active substance aqueous stability, the development therefore focused on selecting functional 
excipients and on identifying suitable concentration ranges for these excipients. 
In selecting the excipients, choices were intentionally limited to excipients that fit the constraints of a 
ketogenic diet, which some patients are put on to help control seizures. Short term stability studies of early 
prototype formulations were conducted to evaluate compatibility of the active substance with potential 
formulation excipients in aqueous solution. The stability was later confirmed in longer term stability studies in 
parallel with the clinical program. 
The overall acceptability and palatability of the formulation was studied in children aged 2 to 18 years as part 
of a Phase 3 open-label clinical study using the intended commercial formulation (Study ZX008-1503). 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020

Results from the study confirmed the palatability and overall acceptability of the formulation in the paediatric 
patient population. 
Two formulation composition variations were used during clinical development:  
i)  A red colored clinical formula which included 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/mL fenfluramine hydrochloride as well as 
placebo, and was filled in amber glass bottles.  
ii) A colorless clinical formulation included the same fenfluramine hydrochloride concentrations in a dye-free 
liquid filled in HDPE bottles.  
The formulations are very similar (qualitatively and quantitatively) except for minor differences in the 
amounts of cherry flavoring and citric acid, as well as the removal of the red coloring. Therefore, they are 
considered representative of each other. The colorless clinical formulation used during clinical studies is the 
same as that intended for marketing. 
Fintepla oral solution is a simple aqueous solution manufactured by addition of the solid ingredients to water 
and mixing at room temperature until completely dissolved. The bulk solution manufacture is followed by 
bottle filling and capping (primary packaging). 
The product will be administered using a suitable size oral syringe that will be co-packaged with the finished 
product. Two 3 mL and two 6 mL oral dosing syringes and a press-in bottle adapter are included in the 
paperboard carton together with the finished product bottle. The 3 mL syringes are printed in green, with 
numbered graduations for 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 mL and unnumbered graduations in 0.1 mL increments. 
The 6 mL syringes are printed in purple, with numbered markings for 3, 4, 5, and 6 mL and unnumbered 
marking in 0.2 mL increments. Both syringes consist of a polypropylene barrel with an HDPE plunger; the 
markings utilize similar line thicknesses. The bottle adapter and syringes are CE marked and have been 
evaluated for performance and suitability. Following a major objection raised on the originally proposed 
graduation of the syringes and the dosing accuracy, the graduations were revised as described above, and 
the 3 mL syringes are proposed to be used for dosing volumes below and including 3 mL. The 6 mL syringe is 
proposed to be used for dosing volumes above 3 mL. To ensure this syringe cannot be used to dose volumes 
below 3.0 ml, the lowest part of the graduation scale is erased. 
During the evaluation, detailed information on the graduation of the syringes and suitability of the device has 
been submitted. Dosing accuracy of the two syringes was evaluated at various dose levels starting at 0.5 mL. 
The provided dose accuracy study is considered representative of the worst-case scenario. 
A study was performed to demonstrate the suitability of the in-use period for the dosing syringes. The 
cleaning study was conducted with two syringes that were supplied with the product during clinical studies 
(1.5 mL syringe and 6 mL). No deterioration to markings or numbering was observed for any of the syringe 
sizes after cleaning by the hand wash method. Similarly, no deterioration was seen for the 6 mL syringes 
from the dishwasher cleaning; however, a slight deterioration of the marking and numbering of the 1.5 mL 
syringe was observed from dishwasher cleaning. The extent of deterioration was not substantial enough to 
affect the visibility or readability of the markings and therefore it was concluded to have no impact upon 
accurate dosing. 
The intended commercial adapter was selected to fit 30 mL – 360 mL finished product bottles and to remain 
in place with repeated use. A study was performed to evaluate the adapter for leakage, security of adapter 
placement within the bottle neck, and durability of the adapter-syringe fitting to repeated use. The correct 
placement of the closure was verified, and no interference between the cap and adapter were observed. No 
loss of the child-resistant feature was reported for any bottles upon opening. Based on the results of this

study, the finished product container-closure was demonstrated to be compatible with appropriately sized, 
commercially available press-in bottle adapters. 
A comprehensive extractables-leachables risk assessment was conducted on the container closure 
components, including the label adhesive, and on the bottle adapter and dosing syringes. The assessment  
concluded that, based on materials of construction of the primary, secondary and associated packaging 
components, their food contact regulations and the criteria for safety discussed in the 1999 FDA Guidance 
Document for the Packaging of Human Drugs and Biologics for oral solutions / suspensions, the leachables 
risk is low for the packaging and delivery of the fenfluramine oral solution. Since the container-closure is 
made of compendial material and complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.2 (Plastic Containers and Closures for 
Pharmaceutical Use), and the polymers and additives of the contact surfaces are suitable for use with 
foodstuffs according to the EU regulations, extractables and leachables studies are not required. 
The primary packaging is HDPE bottle with a child-resistant, tamper-evident cap (multilayer of HDPE/PP/LDPE). 
The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  four  main  steps,  presented  in  scheme  2:  ethylparaben  and 
methylparaben  solution  manufacturing,  bulk  solution  manufacturing,  filling  of  bottles  and  single  unit  carton 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The critical steps in the bulk manufacture are mixing of the buffer components and the mixing after final 
dilution. The critical step in the primary packaging (filling) operation is the bottle filling step. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process  and 
pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications shown in Table 4 include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form:  appearance,  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  fenfluramine  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  methylparaben 
identity  (HPLC),  methylparaben  assay  (HPLC),  ethylparaben  identity  (HPLC),  ethylparaben  assay  (HPLC), 
preservatives  degradation  product  (HPLC),  pH  (Ph.  Eur.),  viscosity  (Ph.  Eur.),  uniformity  of  delivered  doses 
(Ph. Eur.), and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
Residual solvents are not included in the product specification. All excipients, except for the cherry flavoring 
powder, are USP and Ph. Eur. grades. The cherry flavoring powder is food grade as there is no USP or Ph. 
Eur. grade available. The active substance and the excipients do not contain Class 1 residual solvents and 
conform to ICH Q3C limits for Class 2 and Class 3 residual solvents. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment and the 
presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. 
The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.

Fenfluramine HCl is a chiral compound being developed as racemic mixture. Enantiomer composition was 
fully evaluated as part of active substance development. To assess the chiral stability of fenfluramine 
hydrochloride in the finished product formulation, several samples from the finished product registration 
batches were tested using the SFC method. The samples included long-term stored product and accelerated 
stability (40°C/75%RH) samples. Based on these data for the active substance and the finished product, it is 
concluded that there is no specification needed for chirality in the finished product. 
Following a major objection, a nitrosamine risk evaluation has been completed for both the active substance 
and the finished product (excipients, finished product manufacturing process, packaging material and finished 
product storage). No risk of presence of nitrosamines was identified, and potential nitrosating agents are 
absent in the active substance and all excipients. Excipient hydroxyethyl cellulose may contain ≤ 0.2% 
sodium nitrate; however, a supplemental risk evaluation performed by the active substance manufacturer 
determined that the finished product formulation conditions prohibit either reduction of the nitrate to nitrite 
or subsequent nitrosation of the secondary amine in fenfluramine. The primary packaging materials for both 
the active substance and the finished product do not contain nitrocellulose, and therefore pose negligible risk 
of nitrosamines. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 18 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  four  commercial  scale  batches  of  finished  product  (three  unfiltered  and  one  filtered)  of 
different bottle sizes (30 mL, 60 mL, 120 mL, 360 mL, 500 mL) stored for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. Bottles were kept in in an upright and inverted position.  The batches are 
representative  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for 
marketing. The filtered batch was included to support the addition of the bulk filtration step to the commercial 
manufacturing process. 
A bracketing approach was used with regards to bottle size and bottle orientation for the primary batch stability 
studies. Through this design, the full range of bottle sizes was studied on stability. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  fenfluramine  assay,  related  impurities,  methylparaben  assay, 
ethylparaben assay, preservatives known degradation product, pH, viscosity and microbial limits. The analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating. 
The  data  demonstrate  that  fenfluramine  oral  solution  is  stable  over  the  proposed  shelf-life.  No  significant 
changes or trends have been observed and all batches met acceptance criteria both at release and the available 
stability time points, except for the observation of the “barely visible” HEC particles in most samples at the 3-
month time point and in a few samples at a subsequent time point (all manufactured using process A), that 
resulted in an investigation and implementation of the bulk filtration step in the manufacture of the finished 
product, as discussed earlier in the report. 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 22/101 
 
  
  
To date, stability data from the filtered primary stability batch are available for 24 months at 25°C/60%RH and 
6 months at 40°C/75%RH. No significant changes or trends were observed, and all samples met acceptance 
criteria  both  at  release  and  the  available  stability  time  points.  The  data  demonstrate  that  fenfluramine  oral 
solution is stable over the proposed shelf life, and that the addition of in-line filtration to the manufacturing 
process does not have an impact on product quality, including long-term stability. The attribute-by-attribute 
comparison supports a conclusion that the filtered product is equivalent to the unfiltered product and that the 
primary stability batches from the unfiltered product are representative of the filtered product’s stability and 
therefore can be used as registration batches for the filtered product.  
Short-term  temperature  excursions  (such  as  what  might  occur  during  shipping)  are  permitted  based  on 
temperature cycling studies between 5°C and 50°C, and ambient and -20°C. 
Forced degradation studies have been performed on two batches under oxidative, acid, base, thermal, white 
light and UV light stress. Samples were tested for fenfluramine and parabens assay and their related impurities. 
The active substance in fenfluramine oral solutions was demonstrated to be very stable under stress conditions, 
and no new fenfluramine related impurities or degradation products were present at the level of or greater than 
the  identification  threshold  (0.2%).  The  forced  degradation  results  support  the  conclusion  that  the  active 
substance in fenfluramine oral solutions is very stable. 
The in-use studies have been performed in the upright position. Considering the same material for the insert 
is used as for the cap, the primary stability studies including bottles in the inverted position sufficiently justify 
that the quality of the product is not expected to be affected when the product is placed in inverted position 
with the insert present. 
A 90-day in-use study was performed on the intended commercial formulation in 120 mL and 500 mL HDPE 
bottles.  The  120  mL  bottle  is  the  smallest  bottle  that  can  hold  a  90-day  supply.  The  500  mL  bottle  is  not 
intended for EU market, but was included in the study as a bracketing size for the 250 mL and 360 mL bottles. 
The finished product was stored at long term conditions. Use was simulated by withdrawing 0.5 mL (120 mL 
bottle) and 1 mL (500 mL bottle) twice daily (working days) with additional withdraws on Monday and Friday 
or Bank holidays. After opening the bottle was kept open for 60 minutes. Testing was conducted on T0, 30 
days, 60 days and 90 days.   
A second study of 95-day in-use stability was conducted on the intended commercial product in 60 mL, 120 
mL,  and  360  mL  HDPE  bottles  stored  under  the  long-term  conditions  with  simulated  daily  use  resulting  in 
diminishing amount of product in the bottles. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  pH,  drug  assay  and  impurities,  preservative  assay  and  impurities, 
viscosity, microbial limits and preservative efficacy initially and after 30, 60, 90 days or 95 days of simulated 
use.  
The results show that the stability of the product throughout its in-use period remained stable over time, no 
specific trend or change was noted in any of the tested parameters.  
A similar in-use study was conducted for the 2.2 mg/mL intended commercial product stored at 2 – 8°C for 30 
days to support accidental refrigerated storage during the use period. 60 mL and 360 mL bottles were used in 
this study, with the 60 mL bottles being tested after 14 days of simulated use and the 360 mL bottles after 30 
days of simulated use. The obtained data showed out of specification results for the preservatives assay after 
14 days, indicating the product not to be kept in the refrigerator.  
Although the studied in-use study period would not be sufficient to cover the clinical use of the product, it is 
also noted that in the primary stability study, photostability and forced degradation studies there is no indication 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020

that the finished product may be susceptible to deterioration. As such, longer in-use stability studies are not 
considered necessary. However, the applicant is recommended to conduct an additional in-use stability study 
toward the end of shelf life once 48-month samples are available. 
The results conform the stability of the product for a period of 90 days. This is reflected in section 6.3 of the 
SmPC: Use within 3 months of first opening the bottle. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  pH,  drug  assay  and  impurities, 
preservative assay and impurities, and viscosity. The results confirm that the finished product is photostable. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  4  years  and  no  special  storage  conditions  (the 
product should not be refrigerated or frozen) as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
The white child-resistant cap that is part of the finished product container-closure system may contain an 
additive (tallow) which is of bovine origin. The plastic containing this material is subjected to severe 
conditions during manufacture, thus ensuring inactivation of any agents present in the plastic material, 
regardless of the source and type of material. The manufacturer confirms adherence to current EU Legislation 
for Plastics and Articles in Contact with Food EC 10/2011, Current Packaging & Packing Waste Directive 
94/62/EC, Commission Regulation EC No. 2023/2006 on GMP for materials and articles intended to come into 
contact with food. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The finished product manufacturing process was revised during the 
course of development to add an in-line filtration step for the bulk product through a 20μm filter. This change 
was intended to improve the product aesthetic appearance and avoid potential complaints resulting from 
observation of the HEC barely visible particles intrinsic to the formulation. 
The product will be administered using a suitable size oral syringe that will be co-packaged with the product. 
During the procedure the expression of strength was changed to be based on the active moiety in line with 
the SmPC guideline.  
Extensive information on the suitability of dosing syringes has been provided. 
Risk assessment on the presence of nitrosamines impurities identified no risk. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
Three recommendations are agreed with the Applicant to re-evaluate the total impurities acceptance criteria 
for the active substance, to initiate an in-use study of a batch towards the end of shelf-life and to 
implementing of a GC identification method for the cherry flavouring.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
1. The applicant is recommended and has committed to re-evaluate the total impurities acceptance criterion 
(active substance specification) after gathering more manufacturing experience. 
2. The applicant is recommended and has committed to initiate an in-use study of a batch towards the end of 
shelf-life once 48-month samples are available. 
3. The applicant commits to implementing a more discriminative identification method for the cherry 
flavouring. Since this method must be developed and validated, it will be implemented for receipt testing no 
later than the end of 1st Quarter 2021. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant provided an adequate non-clinical package, composed by the non-clinical programme 
conducted to support the DS indication, together with the non-clinical data on fenfluramine available in the 
published literature and in the context of the previous therapeutic use in obese adults at a higher dose range 
(60 to 120 mg/day). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Fenfluramine is a racemic compound containing dexfenfluramine and levofenfluramine in equal amounts. The 
stereochemical configuration of the d or (+) isomer (also known as dexfenfluramine) corresponds to the S 
enantiomer, and the configuration of the l or (-) isomer (levofenfluramine) corresponds to the R enantiomer. 
The choice to develop the racemate (±) fenfluramine in the Dravet Syndrome (DS) indication was driven by 
the efficacy clinical observation in a clinical study where the racemate was used (Ceulemans et al., 2012). 
A well-known primary pharmacological activity of (±) fenfluramine and its metabolite (±) norfenfluramine is 
the release of serotonin. Studies in rats showed that complete depletion of serotonin prevented the 
anticonvulsant activity of fenfluramine, suggesting a role for serotonin in mediating the anticonvulsive effect 
of fenfluramine. The anticonvulsant activity of fenfluramine was shown in mice, rats and in a Zebrafish 
model.  
Studies with Zebrafish models for DS suggest that fenfluramine acts on multiple receptors, including agonism 
of 5-HT2C, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A. 5-HT2B appears not to be involved in the antiepileptic activity of

EMA/639853/2020 
Page 25/101 
 
  
  
fenfluramine in this model.  The (+) enantiomer of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine have the highest 
activity in the serotonin release assay when the locomotor activity is used as endpoint. The (-) enantiomer 
also displays significant activity, but less than the (+) enantiomer. When frequency and duration of abnormal 
epileptiform activity are taken as endpoints in the Zebrafish, the difference between the enantiomers is much 
less pronounced and the parent compound is more active than the nor-metabolites. 
Evidence shows that activation of 5-HT2B receptors potentially underlies valvular heart disease associated 
with fenfluramine. Reference is made to a proprietary study (Study XS-0715) on the effects of the 
fenfluramine and norfenfluramine enantiomers on various receptors and to a publication on the involvement 
of 5-HT2B receptors in fenfluramine associated valvular heart disease. The data show that the (+) 
norfenfluramine enantiomer binds with higher affinity to the 5-HT2B receptor and that this enantiomer is 
more potent at activating the 5-HT2B receptor than the other enantiomers. It was noted that the unbound 
concentrations of (+) and (-) fenfluramine and (-) norfenfluramine in patients are lower than their potency 
for interaction with 5-HT2B receptors but that an interaction of (+) norfenfluramine with the 5-HT2B receptor 
cannot be ruled out. In fact, the ratio between the activation constant (Kact) in an in vitro assay for (+) 
norfenfluramine at the 5-HT2B receptor and the free plasma Cmax is 0.5, suggesting that activation of this 
receptor at half maximal to maximal plasma concentrations appears likely. However, as they come from 
different assays and require extrapolation from in vitro to in vivo data, these observations need to be 
interpreted cautiously.  
The studies in the Zebrafish model also suggest that fenfluramine acts as an antagonist at the σ1-receptor. 
However, in contrast, in vitro data suggested it acted as a positive modulator enhancing the activity of a σ1-
receptor agonist. Data obtained in wild-type CD-1 mice suggested that 5-HT2A agonistic and the σ1-receptor 
antagonist activity of (+) fenfluramine and (+) norfenfluramine may confer part of the antiepileptic activity in 
a model of NMDA-induced seizures. The applicant presented additional literature data suggesting that positive 
modulators at the σ1 receptor have anticonvulsant activity. These data are, however, in contrast with the 
results from Rodriguez-Munoz 2018 obtained in mice that suggested that σ1-antagonism protects against 
seizures.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Fenfluramine 
exerts 
secondary  pharmacological 
effects 
through  monoaminergic  mechanisms. 
Neuroendocrinological  effects  (renin,  prolactin)  are  mainly  affected  through  serotonergic  mechanisms, 
providing at least a potential for secondary effects in patients. 5-HT2C agonism is responsible for the anorexic 
effects of fenfluramine (see also section Safety pharmacology programme below). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In animals, fenfluramine affects EEG, sleep and feeding behaviour, induced anxiogenic effects, motor activity, 
learning and memory, affects respiration, intestinal motility and urinary flow, heart rate and blood pressure.  
These effects were generally mild and of a transient nature and they are related to the primary and 
secondary pharmacological effects of fenfluramine, especially those related to the monoaminergic systems.  
Fenfluramine can act on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by causing an increase in ACTH, cortisol, and 
corticosterone secretion (Fuller 1992). It is a dose-dependent effect and it seems to be mediated by 
serotonin/serotonin agonists/serotonin transporter inhibitors (Fuller 1996). Fuller also described the 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 26/101 
 
  
  
neuroanatomical links demonstrated in the rat, that are compatible with the observed increases in ACTH and 
cortisol. The effect is considered mediated through 5-HT1A receptor. 
In a study in rats (Van de Kar 1985), fenfluramine induced a strong increase in plasma prolactin and 
corticosterone at 5 mg/kg. Referring to a study in healthy volunteers investigating the cortisol response to 60 
or 180 mg divided in three doses of 20 or 60 mg over 24 hours of fenfluramine (Schürmeyer et al. 1996), it 
appears likely that the dose intended for DS patients (maximum total daily dose of 26 mg, regardless of 
weight) would not be expected to give rise to increased cortisol levels as observed in the rat (Van de Kar 
1985). The dose of 20 mg every 8 hours over 24 hours did not increase cortisol levels above baseline in 
healthy volunteers, whereas 60 mg every 8 hours increased mean plasma ACTH and cortisol by 85 and 
129%. Fenfluramine did not modulate the frequency but increased the amplitudes of ACTH and cortisol 
secretory episodes. Schürmeyer concludes that fenfluramine stimulates the activity of the hypothalamic
adrenal axis at a suprapituitary level by modulating the amplitude of ACTH and cortisol secretory 
‐
pituitary
bursts. 
‐
Later publications indicated that fenfluramine increased cortisol at dose levels relevant for DS patients. 
Plasma cortisol decreased at 1 hour after oral doses of 15 or 30 mg and then increased to a peak at 4 hours 
in healthy volunteers (Bond 1995). Increases in cortisol were also found starting at 2 hours after 
administration of an oral dose of 60 mg to depressed and healthy volunteers (Mitchell 1990). 
No data on hERG channel inhibition was provided and the cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies in 
animals predated the introduction of GLP requirements. However a thorough QTc clinical study (AX008-1603) 
was performed and showed no QTc prolongation. These results override the need for further non-clinical 
studies.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No dedicated drug-drug interactions studies were performed. 
Fenfluramine is a substrate of the serotonin transporter and causes a release of serotonin into the synapse. It 
may therefore interact with other serotonergic drugs (including SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, or 
triptans), with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such as MAOIs, or with antipsychotics that may 
affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. This interaction may potentiate the risk of serotonin 
syndrome, even though it is reassuring that literature does not report observations of serotonin syndrome in 
clinical practice (Richelson 1994). Similarly, the risk of coadministration with cyproheptadine, a serotonin 
antagonist, may block the beneficial effects of fenfluramine. The risk of serotonin syndrome is further 
discussed in the clinical pharmacology sections. 
The clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction data for fenfluramine with other drugs, including other AEDs 
used in combination for the treatment of DS, are described in clinical sections.   
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Single dose pharmacokinetics 
Fenfluramine and norfenfluramine exhibited good permeation through Caco-2 cell monolayers with efflux 
ratios between 0.7 and 1.0 over a concentration range of 1 to 100 μM. Neither fenfluramine nor 
norfenfluramine is actively transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 27/101 
 
  
  
Data from published literature showed that (±) fenfluramine is rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract 
in mice, rats and dogs.  
In mice, there were no differences in exposures between the enantiomers of fenfluramine. Cmax values were 
reached within 15 minutes and the plasma half-lives were about 4 hours. 
In rats, (+) and (-) fenfluramine both reached Cmax within 30 minutes. Bioavailability was about 20% for the 
(-) enantiomer. Plasma concentrations increased linearly with the dose over the dose range 2.5 to 6.25 
mg/kg for (-) fenfluramine. However, the (+) enantiomer was metabolised and excreted at a slower rate (T½ 
of 2.6 hours) than the (-) isomer (T½ of 1.1 hours), resulting in a larger area under the curve (AUC). These 
differences are consistent with stereo-selective N-deethylation of fenfluramine, where the formation of 
norfenfluramine from (-) fenfluramine occurs much faster than from (+) fenfluramine.  
In dogs, there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of the (+) and (-) enantiomers of fenfluramine. The 
Cmax occurred within 2 hours and the plasma half-life (T½) was 2.5 hours. The T½ and AUC for both 
enantiomers of norfenfluramine were higher than those for fenfluramine. The T½ and AUC of the (+) and 
(-)norfenfluramine were in the same range. 
Toxicokinetics 
The toxicokinetics of racemic fenfluramine has been evaluated in juvenile rats by an oral dose-range finding 
study and a pivotal 10-week oral, repeated dose toxicity study and in an oral, 13-week repeated dose toxicity 
study in adult rats. The (+) and (-) enantiomers were not separately measured in these studies  
The studies in juvenile rats showed that the exposures of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were similar from 
the first to the last day (76), with no differences between males and females. The increase in fenfluramine 
was greater than dose proportional, while the increase in norfenfluramine was close to dose proportional. 
The 13-week repeated dose toxicity in adult rats, the exposure of fenfluramine was close to dose proportional 
over the dose range from 3.5 to 8 mg/kg/day, except for males from 3.5 to 5 mg/kg/day on Day 89 and for 
both genders from 8 to 13 mg/kg/day on Day 1, the systemic exposure (AUC(0-t)) was greater than dose 
proportional. There was some accumulation on Day 89 relative to Day 1, with accumulations ratios ranging 
from 2.64 to 15.7 for fenfluramine and 1.88 to 3.33 for norfenfluramine. 
Plasma protein binding 
The in vitro plasma protein binding is around 50% for fenfluramine and norfenfluramine over a concentration 
of 10 to 100 ng/mL.  
Distribution to red blood cells 
The in vitro blood-to-plasma ratio of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine was not investigated. Literature data 
indicate that fenfluramine and norfenfluramine tend to concentrate in the red cells rather than the plasma, to 
the extent of about 40% greater (Campbell, 1973).  
Tissue distribution 
The site of action of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine is the brain.  
As determined in rats, fenfluramine is widely distributed throughout tissues (Vd=6-8 L/kg) and passes the 
blood-brain barrier. Fenfluramine and norfenfluramine distribute into brain tissue at concentrations much 
greater than the concentrations found in plasma, with the brain tissue concentration ranging from 15 to 60-
fold that of plasma concentration.  
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 28/101 
 
  
  
The Applicant calculated a maximal concentration of 2.2 to 2.6 μM for the (+) and (-) enantiomers of 
fenfluramine and a maximal concentration of 1.4 to 1.7 μM for the (+) and (-) enantiomers norfenfluramine 
in human brain tissue, based on Cmax values reported in literature for animals and in literature and studies 
for humans. These calculations, however, did not consider the outcome of other literature that suggests that 
the (+) enantiomer of fenfluramine is more slowly metabolised than the (-) enantiomer. 
Metabolism 
The in-vitro metabolism of fenfluramine has been investigated in mice, rats, dogs and humans in vivo. From 
the metabolites of fenfluramine identified, a metabolic pathway has been proposed in human (Brownsill 
1991). Fenfluramine is N-de-ethylated to norfenfluramine which possibly undergoes oxidative deamination to 
the fenfluramine ketone and C-oxidation to the fenfluramine hydroxyketone and fenfluramine diol. The 
fenfluramine hydroxyketone was further biotransformed to the trifluoromethylbenzoic acid, with phase II 
conjugation occurring for both components, the trifluoromethylbenzoic acid to trifluoromethylhippuric acid 
and the fenfluramine diol to fenfluramine diol glucuronide.  
Interspecies comparisons show that there are no metabolites unique to humans. Norfenfluramine was found 
to be a major metabolite in rats and humans, with rats producing higher levels of norfenfluramine than 
humans. In addition, the unconjugated diol occurs at a lower fraction in rat plasma than in human plasma. In 
plasma, the diol metabolite was present at a level equal to 13% of fenfluramine in rats, and 45% of 
fenfluramine in humans. For this metabolite, the 13-week toxicology study provided a 3-fold margin of 
exposure for this metabolite relative to human exposure when rats were tested at the NOAEL of 20 
mg/kg/day.  
Placenta transfer 
Both fenfluramine and norfenfluramine cross the placenta in monkeys and presumably, because of the drug’s 
low molecular weight, in humans (Briggs et al 2011). 
Transfer to milk 
It is not known whether fenfluramine is excreted in human. However its lipophilic properties and low 
molecular weight probably allow the excretion of fenfluramine into milk. Because fenfluramine is readily 
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has a long plasma half-life (about 20 hours), the nursing infant 
could be exposed to a potentially neurotoxic agent during a period of rapid brain development (Briggs et al 
2011). 
Excretion 
Fenfluramine is excreted as parent compound or active metabolite; the remainder is non-active benzoic acid 
and alcohol derivatives. 
In mouse, rat, dog and human, fenfluramine and metabolites are predominantly excreted in urine (>80%) 
via the kidney, with small amounts found in the faeces. This implies that the enterohepatic circulation of 
fenfluramine plays a minor role. 
Marchant et al. (1992) investigated the metabolite profile in 24-hour urines of mice rats and dogs. Dependent 
on the species, 11 metabolites eleven in addition to fenfluramine (1-42%); U1 (2-22%), U2 (diol glucuronide, 
4-24%), U3 (11-24%), U5 (hippurate, 3-21%), U6 (3-7%), U7 (1-8%) U8 (norfenfluramine, 4-31%), U10 
(2-3%) and U11 (hydroxyketone, 2%).  
Public information shows that fenfluramine is also excreted in saliva and sweat to a small extent.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose and repeat dose toxicity 
Results from non-GLP studies have shown that use of high fenfluramine doses in several animal species result 
in CNS signs (tremors, convulsions, salivation and mydriasis) and acute death, most likely due to respiratory 
failure. Lower, chronic doses were usually better tolerated and resulted in fenfluramine pharmacology-related 
effects, primarily decreased body weight gain and food consumption and decreased activity, which was 
shown consistently across species at all dose levels. Overall, clinical signs are quite similar between different 
animal species and between animals and humans.  
Toxicity testing in young adults 
The Applicant has conducted a GLP-compliant 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study (no. 8001991), 
administering 3.5 to 20 mg/kg fenfluramine per day via oral gavage to 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. All 
observed fenfluramine-related effects (clinical signs, decreased body weight and food consumption, changes 
in blood parameters and olfactory epithelium) were considered pharmacological driven and most of these are 
known clinical effects in humans. No mortality or other unexpected events occurred in this toxicity study. No 
changes in the cardiac valves were observed. Macroscopic and microscopic changes observed in several 
tissues were sufficiently explained (i.e. mostly fenfluramine-related, but non-adverse effects) or did not 
appear to be associated with (irreversible) inflammation/degeneration. 
Based on the study findings, the NOAEL is considered to be 20 mg/kg/day. Toxicokinetic evaluation shows 
that at this dose, the safety margin between animals and humans is at least 10-fold for fenfluramine and 23-
fold for the main metabolite norfenfluramine. 
Toxicity testing in juveniles 
Since most available data was obtained in adults, the Applicant conducted two juvenile toxicity studies to be 
able to bridge non-clinical data to paediatric patients.  
A GLP-compliant dose-range finding study (no. 9000468) was performed in juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats. 
They were administered 12 to 100/50 mg/kg fenfluramine per day (once or twice daily) via oral gavage 
starting at PND7.  
In addition, a 10-week pivotal toxicity GLP study in juvenile Sprague Dawley rats (no. 9000406) was 
conducted, orally administering them 3.5 to 20 mg/kg fenfluramine per day, starting at PND7, including 
toxicokinetic investigations. The study was extended with a 4-week recovery period to determine reversibility 
of the findings.  
In both studies, CNS-related clinical signs (e.g. salivation, tremors, incoordination), dehydration, reduced 
body weight and food consumption were present and dose-dependent in severity. Unscheduled mortality was 
related to poor condition, especially in the pre-weaning phase, but no concomitant inflammatory or 
degenerative lesions were found in any of the tissues analysed.  
However, signs of potential fenfluramine toxicity were noted in 2 males in the 9 mg/kg/day group (no. 3022 
with salivation, no. 3008 with decreased activity and muscle tone, tremors, dehydration). One animal was 
found dead, the other animal had bilateral ventricle dilatation at necropsy. In addition, 2 males in the 3.5 
mg/kg/day group were euthanised at day 17 because of domed skulls, which appeared to be caused by 
bilateral ventricle dilatation (i.e. hydrocephalus) at necropsy. Since serotonin may be involved in regulation of 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 30/101 
 
  
  
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and fenfluramine impacts the serotonin pathway, this was further 
discussed. It was concluded that, even if both animals developed hydrocephalus, this may be 
spontaneous/congenital (based on the publications on spontaneous ventriculomegaly) and likely not directly 
related to fenfluramine.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity  
The Applicant submitted six GLP-compliant Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology (DART) studies in 
two animal species. The overall conclusion from the studies is that all effects on fertility and on the offspring 
observed in the DART studies were related to maternal/paternal toxicity, which is in agreement with the 
sparse reproductive toxicity data from Pondimin and most pre-clinical literature studies. The DART studies did 
not show fenfluramine-related clinically relevant effects on the reproductive parameters of males. However, 
effects on female fertility may occur at clinically relevant exposures. It is generally agreed that maternal (F0) 
toxicity is most likely responsible for effects seen in the offspring and that translation of data to the clinic will 
therefore be difficult. However, in agreement with ICH S5 (R3), a direct relation between fenfluramine and 
the occurrence of malformations in rat offspring (F1) at 40 mg/kg/day cannot be excluded, considering that 
(nor)fenfluramine concentrations in foetuses were higher than in mothers (both rats and rabbits). 
Nevertheless, the fenfluramine dose in rats at which malformations were observed related to AUC exposures 
around 28-fold the human AUC at the highest clinical dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day.  
Though the amount of data on use of fenfluramine or benfluorex (i.e. fenfluramine analogue) during human 
pregnancies is limited, these data do not indicate a fenfluramine-related safety concern for embryo-foetal 
development in humans upon use according to the indicated regimen. 
Excipients, impurities and degradation product 
Fintepla contains several excipients, including methyl- and ethylparabens. None of the excipients are novel 
and the amount of individual excipients at the maximum dose of 30 mg/kg are well below the acceptable 
daily intake of these compounds.  
The proposed manufacturing process resulted in batches which contained the impurity 4-fenfluramine at 
lower levels than the juvenile toxicity batches. These batches have been used in the toxicology studies and 
the clinical trials. The assessment of the genotoxic potential of 4-fenfluramine was conducted according to 
ICH guideline M7 on genotoxic impurities and showed no genotoxic potential. No additional impurity studies 
are warranted.        
Genotoxicity 
Fenfluramine hydrochloride was tested in GLP-compliant genotoxicity studies in accordance with ICH 
Guideline S2 (R1). 
Bacterial reverse mutation assays were conducted on the active moiety fenfluramine. The studies were 
performed to GLP with use of adequate positive and negative controls with and without rat S9 activation. Rat 
S9 activation is considered adequate, since the metabolism seemed similar between species and no unique 
human metabolite was identified. The study was performed with five strains of salmonella with a negative 
outcome, which is considered acceptable.  
A GLP in vivo study (no. 9800312) was conducted to evaluate the genotoxicity of fenfluramine when given by 
oral gavage to Sprague-Dawley rats using the bone marrow micronucleus test and the Comet assay. Dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020

levels for the main study was determined by an initial dose-range finding study to 17.5, 3 and 70 mg/kg, 
based on observed effects in the high dose groups. 
In the main study, animals displayed clinical effects in line with effects observed in the other repeat dose 
studies, such as salivation, red staining of the fur at the muzzle, right pinnae, lower jaw, right periorbital 
and/or abdominal areas, yellow staining of the fur at urogenital area, wet fur at the lower jaw, muzzle, 
forelimbs, axillary, ventral cervical, ventral thoracic and/or abdominal areas, and/or red skin at the nasal 
mucosa (one animal). No mortalities occurred. 
In the micronucleus test, the study was interpreted as negative for increase in frequency of micronucleated 
immature erythrocytes, indicating that fenfluramine did not induce chromosome damage. In addition, there 
were no substantial decreases in the proportion of immature erythrocytes, indicating that fenfluramine was 
non-toxic to the bone marrow at the dose levels tested. 
In the Comet assay, animals treated with fenfluramine hydrochloride did not show any substantial increases 
in the tail DNA percentage in the liver tissue. Thus, there was no evidence of an increase in DNA damage in 
this assay. 
Carcinogenicity 
No GLP-compliant carcinogenicity studies have been performed on fenfluramine.  
The CHMP noted that, in line with the BfArM Scientific Advice Meeting of 26 June 2013 and considering that 
no clinically relevant genotoxic potential is identified by fenfluramine, the Applicant proposed to provide two 
long-term carcinogenicity studies (a 2-year GLP-compliant carcinogenicity study in rats and a 26-week GLP-
compliant carcinogenicity study in mice) as a post-marketing commitment. 
Local Tolerance 
No local tolerance studies have been conducted. Considering that no indication of local tolerance was found in 
other repeat-dose studies and as there is clinical experience in the adult and paediatric patient population, 
this is accepted.  
Other toxicity studies 
No studies for antigenicity, immunogenicity have been conducted. In agreement with the argumentation of the 
Applicant, this is accepted.  
No new studies were conducted to investigate dependency. This was further discussed, and a literature 
search provided several investigations concerning self-administration, conditioned place preference and drug 
discrimination studies. In general toxicity studies, fenfluramine did not induce behavioural stereotypies like 
those produced by amphetamine, nor did it induce self-administration. Fenfluramine did however share 
discriminative stimulus properties with drugs that elevate serotonin levels, including MDMA (Ecstacy) and 
other serotonergic drugs, which corresponds with the pharmacological action of fenfluramine. However it did 
not produce the stimulant-like effects of MDMA. It was accepted the property shared between fenfluramine 
and MDMA is likely dysphoria, which is also consistent with the observations of no self-administration in tests 
and a general aversive reaction of the test animals in the studies. From these data, it was agreed that 
fenfluramine did not show potential for abuse or dependency.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant submitted a confirmatory experimental GLP study using the shake flask method (OECD 107) for 
determining log Kow, with the experimental value of 3.4 at pH 7. This value is lower than the cut-off value of 
4.5. The test substance is considered not potentially PBT. Further PBT assessment is not necessary. 
Phase I 
The Applicant refined the Fpen by using the medicinal orphan drug designation for Dravet syndrome, with the 
prevalence  for  the  EU  region  of  0.5  in  10,000  people,  as  adopted  by  the  Committee  for  Orphan  Medicinal 
Products (COMP). The refined Fpen was calculated to be 0.00005 for the EU region. The Applicant calculated 
the PECsw, resulting in a PECsw of 0.00066 µg/L. 
The calculation of the maximum daily dose and the refinement of Fpen were considered acceptable. The 
refined PECsurfacewater is considered acceptable. PECsw is 0.00066 µg/L, which is below the action limit of 0.01 
µg/L. Therefore, a risk to the environment is not anticipated based on the prescribed use of Fintepla. A 
further assessment is not deemed necessary

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The information on the fenfluramine primary pharmacodynamic activity of at relevant receptors in the brain is 
still limited.   
The anticonvulsant activity of fenfluramine appears to be associated with serotonin release and agonistic 
activity at the serotonin receptors 5-HT2C, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A. It is however unclear to which 
extent the agonistic activity at the receptors or the activation of the receptors via fenfluramine-mediated 
release of serotonin contribute to the activity.

The 5-HT2B receptor seems not to be involved in the mode of action regarding the anticonvulsive activity of 
fenfluramine, however it has been implicated as having a possible role in the valvular heart disease 
associated with the use of fenfluramine.  
The potential role of the σ-1 receptor in the mode of action of fenfluramine regarding its anticonvulsant 
activity remains uncertain.  
Fenfluramine exerts secondary pharmacological effects through monoaminergic mechanisms. Fenfluramine 
acts on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, including increase in plasma prolactin and cortisol. Even though 
these observations were done at higher doses than the maximum daily dose for DS patients, an increase in 
cortisol induced by fenfluramine cannot be ruled out. However, it is also recognised that as DS patients are 
already in a physiologically stressful state due to repeated seizures and that fenfluramine has the potential to 
reduce seizures, this concern appears of limited clinical relevance. The impact of plasma prolactin increase 
has been further investigated and discussed in the Clinical sections. 
The non-clinical data suggest that fenfluramine can affect sleep patterns. A potential effect of fenfluramine on 
sleep disturbances in Dravet patients cannot be excluded.   
There was no data on hERG channel inhibition and the animal cardiovascular studies pre-dated the GLP 
requirements. A QTc clinical study has therefore been conducted and showed no QTc prolongation. 
The clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction data, including interaction with serotonergic drugs and 
potential risk of serotonin syndrome, are described in the clinical pharmacology sections. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Data from published literature showed that fenfluramine is rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract in 
mice, rats and dogs. 
The (+) and (-) enantiomers of fenfluramine have different pharmacological properties and there is some 
indication that the pharmacokinetics of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine are different. 
Comparison of the plasma concentrations time curve of fenfluramine showed a slower rate of elimination in 
man than in animals. The T½ of the (+) enantiomer ranged from about 2.5 hr in rat and dog, to about 4.4 hr 
in mouse and averaged 18 hr in man. The T½ of norfenfluramine was longer than that of fenfluramine in all 
of these species. 
The site of action of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine is the brain. Although, the (+) enantiomer of 
fenfluramine is more slowly metabolised than the (-) enantiomer, there is sufficient evidence to assume that 
the concentration of the racemic mixture in the brain is pharmacologically effective for the release of 
serotonin. 
In general, metabolism was adequately described, and no unique human metabolite was identified.  
Toxicology 
The toxicology package is in line with the requirements under the relevant guidelines and due consideration 
to the proposed Fintepla posology was taken.  
Use of high fenfluramine doses in single and repeat dose studies in several animal species resulted in CNS 
signs and acute death, most likely due to respiratory failure. Lower, chronic doses were usually better

Page 34/101 
 
  
  
 
tolerated and resulted in fenfluramine pharmacology-related effects, primarily decreased body weight gain 
and food consumption and decreased activity, which was shown consistently across species at all dose levels.  
Minimal cytoplasmic vacuolation and eosinophilic globules within the olfactory epithelium have been observed 
as a dose-response related effect at all dose levels in both the 13-week repeat dose GLP study in rats and in 
the 10-week GLP study in juvenile rats. It was not possible to conclude on the clinical relevance and the 
findings are not considered of toxicological concern. 
Changes in skin and fur such as red staining was a common observation in the repeat-dose study, the in vivo 
genotoxicity study and the juvenile toxicity studies. A possible explanation of red staining is the secretion of 
porphyrins from the Harderian gland. Although this secretion is species-specific (i.e. not occurring in 
humans), it may be a sign of stress or illness. Fenfluramine is known to increase the stress-related hormone 
cortisol. However stress-related signs are also commonly observed in toxicology studies, due to frequent 
handling of the animals and sampling.  
Few animals dosed with fenfluramine ≥ 5.0 mg/kg/day (repeat-dose study) or ≥ 3.5 mg/kg/day (pivotal 
juvenile toxicity study) showed changes in the retina, such as focal atrophy or folding. These findings were 
still present in the recovery period. The ocular changes in rats are however considered background findings 
and ocular abnormalities in humans using fenfluramine for obesity reasons are rare. Therefore, the retinal 
changes observed in rats do not indicate a clinical safety concern for fenfluramine in the DS indication. 
Overall, clinical signs are similar between different animal species and between animals and humans. 
Findings in juvenile animals did overall not point toward greater susceptibility to fenfluramine-related effects 
than adult animals.  
None of the studies indicated a genotoxic potential of fenfluramine. 
Non-GLP studies did not show any carcinogenic findings. However, in order to confirm this and in line with 
the BfArM advice, two long-term carcinogenicity studies in two different species will be provided as a post-
marketing commitment. Considering that there is no clinically relevant genotoxic potential and no major 
concern regarding the carcinogenic potential, this is acceptable. 
Fenfluramine was shown to have effects on female fertility in a FEED study, and embryo-foetal toxicity was 
observed in rats and rabbits, however at dose levels that also resulted in maternal toxicity. Taking the patient 
population (DS patients) and the lack of clinical findings into account, the benefits for treatment with 
fenfluramine of this population is considered to outweigh the risks of reproductive toxicity. These findings are 
adequately reflected in section 5.3 and 4.6 of the SmPC. 
From the available data, it was agreed that fenfluramine did not show potential for abuse or dependency. 
Given the worldwide withdrawal of fenfluramine for cardiac valvular abnormalities in the late 90s, potential 
cardiotoxicity was specifically considered. An overview of primarily in vivo animal data of potential 
fenfluramine-related valvular heart disease was provided.  Although no valvular heart disease was observed 
in the animal toxicology studies, in vitro receptor binding data suggest that especially (+) norfenfluramine 
has the potential to induce valvular heart disease (as the pEC50 is slightly higher than the EC50 for 
pergolide, associated with valvular heart disease). The lack of findings in the non-clinical studies could be due 
to the limited duration of the studies or the lack of a relevant/predictive animal model.  The occurrence of 
valvular heart disease in some animal models was described in public literature in mice and rats, which 
showed an effect on thickening of the mitral and/or aortic valve following administration of (+) fenfluramine 
or (+) norfenfluramine. The mode of action was determined via 5-HT2B receptor agonism and further 
mobilisation of BM-derived CD34+CD31+ cells by 5-HT2B receptor stimulation as the initial steps of mitral

valve remodelling. Monitoring at a clinical level is therefore warranted. It is noted that investigations of mitral 
and aortic valves will be performed in the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study to be provided as a post-marketing 
commitment. The valvular heart disease is an identified risk adequately described in the Product Information, 
and managed through a number of risk management measures. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, the application is considered approvable.  
However, the applicant should submit the following post-authorisation non-clinical studies: 
- a 2-year GLP-compliant carcinogenicity study in rats 
- a 26-week GLP-compliant carcinogenicity study in mice 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
A statement that clinical trials were carried out in accordance with GCP requirements was included in the 
dossier. However, one of the pivotal studies (study 1) was in fact a combined analysis of patients included in 
other studies, and the details of the exact conduct of the study were very scarce. A protocol for this study 
was not available and a clear description of data collection and analyses were lacking.  
Consequently, the CHMP asked for an inspection to be carried out on the conduct of the Study 1, in 
accordance with Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 and Article 15 of Directive 2001/20/EC. The 
scope of the inspection was to verify compliance with applicable regulations and GCP for selected efficacy and 
safety data reported in the Marketing Authorisation Application for a sample of patients. 
At the inspection of one site, there were one (collective) critical, 20 (collective) major and 7 minor deviations. 
At the inspection of another site, there were no critical, 18 major and 6 minor deviations. At the inspection of 
the sponsor site, there were nine (collective) critical, 29 (collective) major and 14 minor deviations. 
The impact of these deviations, including the impact on the reliability of trial data, the assessment and the 
benefit-risk evaluation of Fintepla, have thereafter been taken into consideration during the evaluation of the 
dossier. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Fenfluramine is a racemic compound containing dexfenfluramine (S enantiomer or (+)) and levofenfluramine 
(R enantiomer or (-)). The clinical doses of fenfluramine hydrochloride are between 0.2 to 0.8 mg/kg/day 
administered orally in 2 divided doses (BID), with a maximum total daily dose of 30 mg, regardless of 
weight. For patients concomitantly taking stiripentol (with clobazam and/or valproate), a modification in the 
maximum daily dose of fenfluramine hydrochloride to 0.5 mg/kg/day, not to exceed a total daily dose of 20 
mg, is recommended. 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 37/101 
 
  
  
 
Three phase 1 clinical studies and the phase 3 Study 1 were the primary contributors of pharmacokinetic data 
in the development programme of fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome. Characterization was 
supplemented with data from in vitro studies and literature.  
Absorption  
For fenfluramine, the Cmax occurs ~3 h following a single oral dose and is 28.6 ng/mL following a dose of 0.4 
mg/kg, and 59.3 ng/mL following a dose of 0.8 mg/kg fenfluramine HCl. The AUCinf is 673 ng × h/mL and 
1660 ng × h/mL following 0.4 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg, respectively. For norfenfluramine, the Cmax occurs ~12 
h following a single oral dose and is 11.7 ng/mL and 16.1 ng/mL following a dose of 0.4 mg/kg or 0.8 mg/kg, 
respectively. The AUCinf is 798 ng × h/mL and ~800 ng × h/mL following 0.4 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg, 
respectively. The metabolite-parent ratio is 0.26 to 0.41 for the Cmax and 0.5 to 1.2 for the AUCinf and 
decreases with increasing dose; the AUCinf of norfenfluramine is similar following a 0.4 mg/kg dose 
compared to a 0.8 mg/kg dose. The absolute bioavailability of fenfluramine in solution is approximately 75-
83% based on literature data (no absolute oral bioavailability study was conducted. Fenfluramine is highly 
soluble and highly permeable. Food does not affect the Cmax, tmax or AUC of fenfluramine or 
norfenfluramine. 
Distribution 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine is ~50% using equilibrium dialysis. 
The in vitro blood-to-plasma ratio of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine was not investigated. Literature data 
indicates that fenfluramine and norfenfluramine tend to concentrate in the red cells rather than the plasma, 
to the extent of about 40% greater. After absorption fenfluramine is widely distributed throughout the body, 
with high concentrations in the brain, kidney, liver, bile, and urine (post-mortem data in a 13-year old boy 
who ingested 2000 mg fenfluramine HCl). The geometric mean (CV%) volume of distribution (Vz/F) of 
fenfluramine is 11.9 (16.5%) L/kg following oral administration of fenfluramine HCl in healthy subjects.  
Elimination 
Most of an orally administered, radiolabelled dose of fenfluramine is recovered in urine (>90%); little 
radioactivity is excreted in faeces. Absorbed fenfluramine is mainly excreted as metabolite. The geometric 
mean (CV%) clearance (CL/F) of fenfluramine is 6.9 (29%) L/h and the half-life is 20 hours following oral 
administration of fenfluramine HCl healthy subjects. The elimination half-life of norfenfluramine is ~30 h. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose-proportionality: Based on data from the studies 1604 and 1505, Cmax and AUCinf of fenfluramine 
appear dose proportional over the 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg fenfluramine HCl dose range. However, the Cmax and 
AUCinf of norfenfluramine are not dose-proportional over the 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg dose range. The AUCinf 
increase was 0.5-fold for the 0.8 mg/kg fenfluramine HCl dose compared to the 0.4 mg/kg dose. The Cmax 
increase was 0.7-fold for the 0.8 mg/kg dose compared to the 0.4 mg/kg dose. 
Time dependency: The t½ of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine indicates that approximately 94% of 
steady-state would be reached in approximately 4 days for fenfluramine and 5 days for norfenfluramine (4 
half-lives). The time to steady-state was supported by data from Study 1603, in which the increase in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 38/101 
 
  
  
trough level of fenfluramine between Day 5 and Day 7 was approximately 6% (n=59) and 11% (n=60) for 
doses of 15 mg BID and 60 mg BID, respectively. Based on the PK data from studies 1505 and 1603, a Cmax 
accumulation ratio of 3.8- to 4.1-fold for fenfluramine may be expected and a Cmax accumulation ratio of 
6.2- to 6.4-fold for norfenfluramine.  
Inter- and intra-subject variability: No information was provided on the intra-individual variability, 
because individual PK profiles were only evaluated on single occasions in the studies. The inter-individual 
variability in healthy volunteers is 27-30% for fenfluramine and norfenfluramine at a dose in mg/kg without 
concomitant medication. The inter individual variability for fenfluramine and norfenfluramine increased to 34-
43% in the presence of stiripentol, clobazam and valproic acid and decreases to 17-27% in the presence of 
cannabidiol. Greater variability was observed in patients with Dravet syndrome who participated in the Phase 
3 trials. The variability ranged from 33% to 85% in fenfluramine PK parameters and from 43 to 56% in 
norfenfluramine PK parameters.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population: Study 1501 and Study 1502 investigated fenfluramine in children 
and adolescents with DS. The study results were integrated in Study 1. In paediatric patients who received 
fenfluramine HCl 0.8 mg/kg/day, maximum 30 mg/day in divided doses twice daily, the geometric mean 
steady-state fenfluramine (coefficient of variation) for Cmax was 68.6 (41%) ng/mL and AUC0-24h was 1400 
(44%) ng × h/mL. Norfenfluramine Cmax,ss was 37.8 (50%) ng/mL and AUCss,0-24 was 872 ng × h/mL. 
Fenfluramine has a time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of 3 hours at steady state. 
Norfenfluramine has a tmax of 4 to 4.5 hours. At a dose of 30 mg (maximum administered dose), the 
exposure appears higher in children compared to adults.  
Special populations 
Impaired renal function: Renal elimination is the predominant route of elimination of fenfluramine-related 
products, with more than 90% of the administered dose eliminated in the urine as parent or metabolites. 
There are no human clinical data on the effect of renal impairment on the PK of fenfluramine and 
norfenfluramine. 
Impaired hepatic function: No studies on the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of fenfluramine in 
adults or children were found. With hepatic metabolism of fenfluramine, plasma drug concentrations may be 
affected in patients with significant hepatic impairment. Subjects with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment were excluded from the phase 3 clinical trials.  
Gender: The PK of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were consistent between males and females. 
Race: The evaluation was limited by the small sample size of non-white subjects that no conclusion on the 
effect of race on the PK can be made. The genetic polymorphs of the enzymes that metabolize fenfluramine 
are similar across races, only their frequency differs. Thus, although the mean exposure may differ slightly 
depending on race, the range of exposure would be expected to be similar. 
Weight/Body Mass Index: The results of the PopPK analysis indicate that fenfluramine and 
norfenfluramine PK parameters are related to patient body weight. However, as the dose is based on body 
weight, exposure is expected to be comparable in patients across a broad range of ages. Examination of the 
post-hoc PK parameter and exposure estimates in relationship to BMI, indicated that the drug clearance and 
PK exposure of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine (Cmax and AUC) increase with increasing BMI. 
Elderly: Fintepla is indicated in children with Dravet syndrome aged 2 to older. No data in geriatric patients 
have been submitted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 39/101 
 
  
  
Children: The exposure (Cmax and AUC) to fenfluramine and norfenfluramine increases with age for the 0.2 
mg/kg dosing group. The exposure (Cmax and AUC) to fenfluramine and norfenfluramine appears 
independent of age for the 0.8 mg/kg dosing group.  
Pregnancy and nursing: No information is currently available from the literature about fenfluramine in 
pregnant women. It is not known whether fenfluramine and/or norfenfluramine are excreted in human milk, 
although (+) fenfluramine is transferred into the milk of lactating rats. The use of fenfluramine during 
pregnancy or lactation is not recommended. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Fenfluramine as victim: In vitro, fenfluramine is metabolised by CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 
3A4; with the involvement of CYP2C8 and 2C9 only at higher concentrations. Norfenfluramine is metabolised 
in vitro by CYP2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. The contribution of the individual enzymes to the 
biotransformation of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine is unknown. Furthermore, the involvement of other 
enzymes (e.g. UGTs) in the metabolism of norfenfluramine is unknown. If norfenfluramine is glucuronidated 
to a significant extent, UGT inhibitors may lead to an increased exposure to norfenfluramine. Fenfluramine 
and norfenfluramine were not substrates of drug transporters. 
Clinical DDI studies were performed with the combination of clobazam, valproic acid and stiripentol and with 
cannabidiol. Stiripentol is an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. Clobazam is an inhibitor of 
CYP2D6. Valproic acid is an inhibitor of UGTs. Cannabidiol is an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A4. 
No clinical DDI studies were performed specifically investigating the individual DDI with clobazam, valproic 
acid and stiripentol. Concomitant administration of fenfluramine with stiripentol, clobazam and valproic acid 
compared to concomitant administration of fenfluramine with clobazam and valproic acid resulted in an 
increase for fenfluramine of 1.4-fold in AUC and 1.2-fold in Cmax and a decrease for norfenfluramine of 1.6-
fold in AUC and 1.7-fold in Cmax. When cannabidiol was concomitantly administered with fenfluramine, the 
Cmax and AUC of fenfluramine increased 1.1-fold and 1.4-fold. In contrast, the Cmax and AUC of 
norfenfluramine decreased 1.4-fold and 1.5-fold. No dose adjustments were recommended with valproate, 
clobazam or cannabidiol. A fenfluramine HCl reduced dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 17 mg/day 
is recommended for patients taking concomitant stiripentol. If fenfluramine, cannabidiol and stiripentol were 
to be administered concomitantly, no further dose adjustment is required. 
Given the lack of supportive clinical evaluation of induction of CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 and impact on fenfluramine 
PK, caution should be exercised when fenfluramine is co-administered with drugs that are known to induce 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. 
Fenfluramine as perpetrator: Based on in vitro data, fenfluramine is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. There have 
been reports of clinical drug-drug interactions with the concomitant administration of fenfluramine and 
CYP2D6 substrates such as tricyclic antidepressants (Fogelson 1997; Price 1990). Steady-state desipramine 
concentrations increased approximately 2-fold with concomitant administration of fenfluramine. of CYP2D6.  
At clinically relevant systemic steady state concentrations, norfenfluramine is an inhibitor of MATE1.  
Furthermore, fenfluramine may be an inducer of CYP3A4 at maximal intestinal concentrations. Based on in 
vitro data, it cannot be excluded that fenfluramine is an inducer of CYP2B6 at clinically relevant portal vein 
concentrations.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Fenfluramine pharmacodynamics (PD) were primarily studied in the open-label, proof-of concept study 
ZXIIS2015-004 as well as the dedicated QTc study AX008-1603. Further, the phase 1 studies contributed to 
exploratory PD data.  
The mechanism of action of fenfluramine in the prevention of seizures in Dravet Syndrome has only been 
partially clarified. It appears that through stimulation of the release of serotonin, fenfluramine is able to have 
an agonistic effect on various 5-HT receptors resulting in overall 5-HT stimulation.  
Fenfluramine may also have indirect inhibitory effect on NMDA receptors, possibly through interaction with 
both serotonin and sigma-1-receptors, but the pathology of Dravet is still incomplete and the mechanism of 
action of fenfluramine is still not fully understood. 
Primary  pharmacology:  14  study  participants  contributed  to  interim  report  of  Study  ZXIIS2015-004.  The 
effective doses used in this cohort were administered as fixed doses between 5 and 40 mg/day, most commonly 
5 or 10 mg BID (10-20mg daily). These doses corresponded to approximately 0.8 to 1.0 mg/kg/day for young 
children,  and  0.1  to  0.3  mg/kg/day  for  the  older  patients.  The  median  (min,  max)  number  of  major  motor 
seizures per month during Baseline was 2.5 (0.4, 38.4). During treatment with fenfluramine, the median (min, 
max) monthly frequency of motor seizures was 2.0 (0.2, 9.1), a median reduction from baseline of -76.3%. 
13/14  Patients  achieved  a  ≥  50%  reduction  from  baseline  in  monthly  major  motor  seizure  frequency.  A 
treatment response (≥ 75%) was achieved in 10/14 patients and 2 (14.3%) patients were seizure free for the 
duration of time in the study at the time of this interim report (1 to 12 months).  
From this open-label treatment experience, the Applicant derived the 0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg/day doses used in the 
phase 3 clinical program. Since none of the 14 patients appeared to have reached the maximum dose of 0.8 
mg/kg/day,  the  study  results  at  interim  data  cut-off  appeared  to  provide  inadequate  support  for  the  dose 
recommendation carried forward in phase 3 studies. The MAH clarified that a maximum dose of 30 mg/day was 
selected to ensure a lower exposure than the exposure expected in treatment of obesity where cardiac toxicity 
led  to  withdrawal  of  the  product.  The  maximum  recommended  dose  in  the  SmPC  for  patients  who  are  not 
taking stiripentol is 0.35 mg/kg twice daily. The rational for this dose is not clear but it is within the dosing 
range  used  in  study  ZXIIS2015-004  where  fenfluramine  was  dosed  between  0.1  and  1.0  mg/kg/day.  The 
majority of patients experienced some degree of improvement.   
Secondary pharmacology: Fenfluramine was originally approved and widely marketed as an appetite 
suppressant for the treatment of obesity in adults. The anorexic effect of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine is 
mediated through the 5-HT2C receptor (Vickers 2001). In the phase 3, placebo-controlled studies, more 
subjects treated with ZX008 compared with placebo-treated subjects experienced AEs of decreased appetite 
(42/122 [34.4%] vs 7/84 [8.3%]) and weight loss (11/122 [9.0%] vs 1/84 [1.2%]).  
A dedicated QTc study was conducted (study ZX008-1603). The doses of fenfluramine tested produced 
plasma levels of fenfluramine relevant for comparison to clinical conditions. The study results demonstrate 
that fenfluramine did not exert QTc prolonging effects following neither therapeutic nor supratherapeutic 
dosing.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Three phase 1 clinical studies and the phase 3 Study 1 were the primary contributors of pharmacokinetic data 
in the development programme of fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome. Characterization was 
supplemented with data from in vitro studies and literature. A Pop PK model and a PBPK model were 
developed but they were not considered suitable to predict the exposure of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine. 
The provided PK information is too limited to allow a full evaluation in particular in terms of differential 
exposure of metabolites and enantiomers. There are indications in literature that the pharmacokinetics are 
different for the R and S enantiomers of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine and the R-enantiomer appears to 
be more slowly metabolised than the S-enantiomer. It cannot be excluded that R-norfenfluramine may 
interact with 5-HT2B receptors at clinically relevant concentrations.  
The ADME parameters were established based on study data and literature. Fenfluramine is highly soluble 
and highly permeable with an absolute bioavailability above 70%. Fenfluramine pharmacokinetics is 
independent of food. The in vitro plasma protein binding of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine is ~50%. The 
volume of distribution is 11.9 L/kg. 
A number of CYP systems contribute to the metabolism of fenfluramine. Fenfluramine is metabolised in vitro 
by CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4; with the involvement of CYP2C8 and 2C9 only at higher 
concentrations. Norfenfluramine is metabolised by CYP2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 in vitro. No full 
biotransformation profile has been determined in plasma and urine. Primarily, in vivo metabolism is carried 
out via CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP2D9. The first step of metabolism involves formation of the active 
metabolite, norfenfluramine. Further metabolism yields 4 inactive metabolites. The primary route of excretion 
is via urine. Clearance is an estimated 6.9 L/h and T½ is an estimated 20 hours in healthy subjects. Although 
fenfluramine undergoes hepatic metabolism, consequences of possible genetic polymorphism do not appear 
clinically relevant. This may in theory be due to the multiple possible pathways of metabolism. Literature data 
indicates that norfenfluramine may be glucuronidated to a significant extent.  
Dose-proportionality across the therapeutic range of fenfluramine is overall present for fenfluramine after a 
single dose. For norfenfluramine exposure increased less than dose-proportionally across the 0.4 to 0.8 
mg/kg dose range. Based on data from studies 1505 and 1603 accumulation was observed. The accumulation 
ratios for fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were 3.7 and 6.4 (Cmax) and 2.6 and 3.7 (AUC0-24), 
respectively.  
The phase 1 studies overall demonstrated low inter-subject variability. The variability in Dravet patients were 
up to 85% in the phase 3 trials. In paediatric patients who received fenfluramin HCl 0.8 mg/kg/day, 
maximum 30 mg/day in divided doses twice daily, the geometric mean steady-state fenfluramine (coefficient 
of variation) for Cmax was 68.6 (41%) ng/mL with a Tmax of 3 hours and AUC0-24h was 1400 (44%) ng × 
h/mL. 
No clinical studies were conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Renal and hepatic 
impairments are categorised as missing information in the RMP and the relevant statements are included in 
the SmPC. In order to characterise the effect of renal and hepatic impairments on the pharmacokinetic of 
fenfluramine, the Applicant will provide a PK study in subjects with renal impairment and a PK study in 
subjects with hepatic impairments post-marketing (category 3 studies, as detailed in the RMP). 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of fenfluramine depend on bodyweight. Therefore, a weight-based dosing is 
recommended, and exposure is expected to be comparable across a broad age range. Fenfluramine

pharmacokinetics seem independent of gender, race and genotype. Fenfluramine PK was not studied in 
elderly for the claimed indication. Fenfluramine is not recommended in pregnant or lactating patients, 
primarily due to lack of data.  
Clinical DDI studies were performed with the combination of clobazam, valproic acid and stiripentol and with 
cannabidiol. No dose adjustments were recommended with valproate, clobazam or cannabidiol. A reduced 
fenfluramine HCl dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 17 mg/day is recommended for patients taking 
concomitant stiripentol. If fenfluramine, cannabidiol and stiripentol were to be administered concomitantly, 
no further dose adjustment is required.  
Fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were not substrates of drug transporters. If norfenfluramine is 
glucuronidated significantly, concomitant UGT inhibitors may lead to increased exposure of norfenfluramine.  
Caution should be exercised when fenfluramine is co-administered with drugs that are known to induce 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. In order to complete the available data and further investigate if fenfluramine is 
a clinically relevant inducer, the Applicant committed to provide a clinical DDI study (CYP2B6 at clinically 
relevant portal vein concentrations and CYP3A4 at maximal intestinal concentrations) and provide it as a 
post-authorisation measure.  The relevant information is appropriately reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
At clinically relevant systemic steady state concentrations, in vitro data indicated fenfluramine is an inhibitor 
of CYP2D6 and norfenfluramine of MATE1. In order to complete the available data and further investigate the 
clinical relevance of the effect, the Applicant commits to provide a clinical DDI study of norfenfluramine as a 
clinically relevant inhibitor of MATE1 and provide it as a post-authorisation measure. The relevant information 
is appropriately reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Pharmacodynamics and PK/PD 
Pharmacodynamic data were derived from studies ZXIIS2015-004 (proof-of-concept study) and AX008-1603 
(dedicated QTc study). Exploratory PD data were also derived from the phase 1 studies. Fenfluramine 
mediates its effects at least in part through invoking serotonergic agonism at 5-HT receptors. This is believed 
to reduce seizures. As the mechanism of action has not been completely clarified, it was considered 
acceptable to assess primary pharmacology on a more global level than simply 5-HT receptor agonism. A 
total of 14 patients in the proof-of-concept study provided data at the time of interim data cut-off. These 
patients contributed to documenting the starting dose recommended in the SmPC.  
Regarding secondary pharmacology, anorexic effects were observed. These are also believed to be mediated 
through the 5-HT receptor agonism and are thus not unexpected. No effect on the QTc interval was observed 
in the dedicated QTc study.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions may be experienced especially in the event of concomitant treatment with 
other medicinal products invoking serotonergic agonism. This may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. It 
is however reassuring that literature has not reported events of serotonin syndrome in relation to treatment 
with fenfluramine (Richelson 1994). As a precautionary measure, the risk for serotonin syndrome when 
fenfluramine is administered with other serotonergic drugs (including SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, 
or triptans), with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such as MAOIs, or with antipsychotics that may 
affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, is addressed in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Similarly, the risk 
of coadministration with cyproheptadine, a serotonin antagonist which may block the beneficial effects of 
fenfluramine, is also addressed in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Overall, a fragile concentration-effect relationship has been demonstrated. 
The relevant PK and PD data are appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP was of the view that, even though the PK data package of fenfluramine is limited and the PK of the 
enantiomers of both fenfluramine and norfenfluramine have not been fully elucidated, the available data are 
acceptable to support the approval of fenfluramine in DS.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the uncertainties related to pharmacology: 
- Clinical DDI study of norfenfluramine as a clinically relevant inhibitor of MATE1  
- Clinical DDI study (CYP2B6 at clinically relevant portal vein concentrations and CYP3A4 at maximal 
intestinal concentrations) 
- PK study in subjects with renal impairment (category 3 study, as detailed in the RMP) 
- PK study in subjects with hepatic impairments (category 3 study, as detailed in the RMP) 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dedicated dose response study was performed. 
The doses used in Study 1 were based on the data from an open label trial of fenfluramine as an add-on 
therapy to conventional therapy (Study ZXIIS2015-04). The effective doses used in Study ZXIIS2015-04 
ranged between 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, administered as fixed doses between 5 and 40 mg/day, most 
commonly 5 or 10 mg BID. Doses in Study 1 were selected within the effective range used in Study 
ZXIIS2015-04, balancing a need to establish efficacy (0.8 mg/kg/day) as well as a desire to identify a 
minimally effective dose, especially in younger patients (0.2 mg/kg/day). The dosage of 0.5 mg/kg/day 
(maximum dose 20 mg/day) used in Study 1504c2 was selected based on data from the study Cohort 1, as 
well as from an already completed drug-interaction study (Study 1505 Part 1) and an early version of a 
physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Clinical efficacy was evaluated in two double-blind randomised studies: Study 1 and Study 1504 Cohort 2. In 
Study 1, stiripentol (STP) use was an exclusion criterion, while in Study 1504 treatment with STP was an 
inclusion criterion. Both studies have almost identical methods.

Study 1 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The main inclusion criteria were: 
- Male or female, aged 2 to 18 years.  
- Clinical diagnosis of Dravet syndrome, where convulsive seizures were not completely controlled by current 
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 
- Subjects had to meet all the following 5 criteria: 
a. Onset of seizures in the first year of life in an otherwise healthy infant. 
b. A history of seizures that were either generalized tonic-clonic or unilateral clonic or bilateral clonic, 
and were prolonged. 
c. Initial development was normal. 
d. History of normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without cortical brain malformation. 
e. Lack of alternative diagnosis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 46/101 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
- Subjects had to meet at least one of the following 3 criteria: 
a.  Emergence  of  another  seizure  type,  including  myoclonic,  generalized  tonic-clonic,  tonic,  atonic, 
absence and/or focal developed after the first seizure type. 
b. Prolonged exposure to warm temperatures induced seizures and/or seizures were associated with 
fevers due to illness or vaccines, hot baths, high levels of activity, and sudden temperature changes, 
and/or seizures were induced by strong natural and/or fluorescent lighting, as well as certain visual 
patterns. 
c. Genetic test results consistent with a diagnosis of Dravet syndrome (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, 
variant of unknown significance, or inconclusive but unlikely to support an alternative diagnosis). 
- Subject had ≥ 4 convulsive seizures (tonic, tonic-atonic, tonic-clonic, or clonic) per 4-week period for the past 
12 weeks prior to Screening, reported by parent/guardian to investigator or investigator medical notes. 
-  All  medications  or  interventions  for  epilepsy  (including  ketogenic  diet  [KD]  and  vagal  nerve 
stimulator/stimulation [VNS]) were stable for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and were expected to remain 
stable throughout the study. 
Treatments 
Study 1 
Doses to be studied included 0.2 mg/kg/day and 0.8 mg/kg/day, divided into 2 daily (BID) doses, up to a 
maximum of 30 mg/day. Doses were administrated in the morning and in the evening. An intermediate dose 
of 0.4 mg/kg/day was used for titration. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of Study 1 was to demonstrate that ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day is superior to placebo as 
adjunctive therapy in the treatment of DS in children and young adults based on change in the frequency of 
convulsive seizures between the Baseline Period and the combined Titration and Maintenance (T+M) Periods. 
The secondary objectives were to demonstrate that ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day to placebo, and to demonstrate 
the superiority to placebo for both doses (0.8 and 0.2 mg/kg/day) for the proportion of subjects who achieve 
a ≥ 50% reduction from Baseline in convulsive seizure frequency and for the longest convulsive seizure-free 
interval. 
The study also included a PK objective with the characterisation of the PK of ZX008 0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg/day at 
steady state in subjects ages 2 to 6 years and > 6 to 18 years with DS. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The main endpoints of Study 1 were: 
Primary Endpoint 
• Change in CSF (mean number of convulsive seizures per 28 days) from Baseline to the T+M period 
Key Secondary Endpoints 
• Proportion of subjects (n [%]) who achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in CSF from Baseline to the T+M period 
• Duration of the longest convulsive seizure–free interval during the T+M period (days) 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 47/101 
 
  
  
 
Additional secondary endpoints were number of convulsive seizure-free Days, proportion of subjects with ≥ 
25% and ≥ 75% reduction from baseline in CSF, proportion of subjects achieving complete or nearly 
complete convulsive seizure freedom, total (convulsive + nonconvulsive) seizure frequency, change from 
baseline in CSF by seizure type, change from baseline in frequency of all nonconvulsive seizures, change 
from baseline in nonconvulsive seizure frequency by seizure type, rescue medication usage, incidence of 
hospitalization and other resource utilization, incidence of status epilepticus, duration of prolonged seizures, 
clinical global impression (CGT, assessed by the parent/caregiver and by the principal investigator, quality of 
life in childhood epilepsy (QOLCE) scale, paediatric quality of life inventory (PedsQL) parent report scale and 
family impact module, quality of life of the parent/caregiver (using EQ-5D-5L). 
Sample size 
Based on the stiripentol studies and assumptions regarding treatment difference and SD, the initial sample size 
for studies 1501 and 1502 was 105 subjects required to find a treatment difference of 40% at a 5% significance 
level with a 90% power. Following the presentation of the phase III Epidyolex study results, the sample size 
was recalculated, using a higher variation observed in the Epidyolex study. A sample size of approximately 120 
subjects (40 per arm) affords 90% power to detect a difference in mean change from Baseline of 40 percentage 
points with 55% SD.  
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Two randomisation schemes were implemented using a 2:2:1:1 scheme (0.2 mg/kg/day: 0.8 mg/kg/day: 0.2 
placebo: 0.8 placebo): randomisation to dose group, and randomisation to study drug concentration.  
The  Titration,  Maintenance,  and  Taper/Transition  Periods  of  the  study  were  double-blind.  The  ZX008  and 
placebo solutions were identical. The blinding scheme incorporated combinations of volume and concentration 
to ensure that the volume of study medication taken could not be associated with a specific dose group 
Statistical methods 
General considerations 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) (randomized) set included all subjects randomised to receive study treatment. 
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) Population was defined as all randomised subjects who received at least 
1 dose of ZX008 or placebo and for whom at least 1 week of diary data were available. Subjects were 
analysed according to the treatment group to which they were randomised. The primary comparison of 
ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day to placebo, as well as key secondary analyses, were performed using the mITT 
Population. 
All efficacy parameters were summarized by descriptive statistics. Two-sided statistical significance testing 
(alpha level = 0.05) comparing ZX008 to placebo were performed for the primary and secondary endpoints, 
unless otherwise noted. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in the mean convulsive seizure frequency (MCSF) per 28 days 
between the Baseline and T+M periods. For each subject, the convulsive seizure frequency (CSF) will be 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 48/101 
 
  
  
calculated from all available data collected during the Baseline and T+M Periods, and the treatment group 
MCSF per 28 days (MCSF) will be calculated for the baseline and T+M period. 
The baseline period is the 42 days immediately preceding the Randomization visit and the T+M period is 
planned for 15 weeks (including 3 weeks titration). Actual durations will be computed for each subject based 
on the individual subject’s start and stop dates for each period with the exception that if the baseline period 
is longer than 42 days, the average for the baseline period will be the 42 days’ data immediately preceding 
the Randomization date. 
The CSF will be counted from the daily diary records provided by the Subject or Parent/Caregiver. For any 
individual subject, the convulsive seizure frequency per 28 days during the baseline period (CSFB) will be 
derived as follows: 
CSFB = (28 × Total number of convulsive seizures during the Baseline Period) / Total number of days in the 
Baseline Period with non-missing diary data 
For each treatment group, the mean is obtained by averaging over the subjects in the treatment group. 
Similarly, for each subject, the convulsive seizure frequency per 28 days for the T+M period (CSFT+M) is 
derived. 
The percentage change from baseline for any individual subject will be estimated by (CSFT+M - 
CSFB)*100/CSFB. The difference from baseline will be estimated by CSF

The primary endpoint was analysed using a parametric ANCOVA model with treatment group (ZX008 dose or

placebo) and age group (< 6 years, ≥ 6 years) as factors, log Baseline frequency (CSFB) as a covariate, and 
log CSFT+M + 1 as response. Treatment group means and difference from placebo were estimated with least 
squares means from the analysis model along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and associated 2-sided P 
values. Estimated treatment group means and CI endpoints were exponentiated for presentation. If 
distributional assumptions of the ANCOVA were not met, a nonparametric analysis was to be performed in its 
stead. 
Supplementary and sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint 
Per-Protocol Analysis: The primary efficacy analysis was repeated on the PP Population. 
Percentage Reduction from Baseline: An alternative approach calculates the percentage change in CSF from 
Baseline directly and uses that quantity as the response variable in an ANCOVA model. Specifically, the 
ANCOVA used the percentage change from the T+M period as the response variable, Baseline CSF as a 
covariate, and treatment and age stratum as classification factors. 
The primary analysis described above was repeated with Baseline seizure frequency as a categorical variable, 
rather than a covariate. Baseline seizure frequency per 28 days was categorized as either < 10; 10 to 50; or 
> 50. 
A nonparametric ANCOVA will be used to analyse the data, with ranks of the baseline CSFB as a covariate 
and ranks of CSFT+M as response 
The primary analysis described above was repeated using data from the Maintenance period only as 
response. For subjects who did not reach the Maintenance period, data from the Transition were used to 
represent their Maintenance period data. A similar ANCOVA model was used, and if distributional assumptions 
were not met, a nonparametric analysis was performed.

Key secondary endpoints 
Proportion of Subjects with ≥ 50% Reduction from Baseline in Convulsive Seizure Frequency (50% 
Responder Rate) 
The comparison between the ZX008 group and placebo group was made using a logistic regression model 
that incorporated the same factors as the ANCOVA used in the primary analysis. This modelled a categorical 
response variable (achieved 50 percentage point reduction, yes or no) as a function of Treatment group 
(ZX008 and placebo), Baseline seizure frequency, and age group (< 6 years, ≥ 6 years).  
Longest Convulsive Seizure–Free Interval 
The longest convulsive seizure-free interval was summarized; summary statistics included median, mean, 
minimum, maximum, the 25th and 75th percentiles, and 95% confidence intervals on the difference in 
medians between groups (Hodges-Lehmann estimator). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test for 
differences between ZX008 and placebo, and the P values from this test were presented.  
Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
There will be no imputation of missing data for efficacy endpoints. 
Seizure Diaries: Seizures are recorded in the Daily Seizure Diary (DSD), while the End of Day Diary (EDD) 
provides Yes/No confirmation that that seizures were experienced for a specific date, or that the date was 
seizure free. 
• If no seizures are entered in the DSD and the EDD confirms seizure freedom, the number of seizures for 
that date is zero. 
• If seizures are entered in the DSD and the EDD states seizure freedom, the seizures recorded for that date 
supersede the EDD stating seizure freedom. 
• If no seizures are entered in the DSD and there is no response in the EDD, that day will be considered to 
have missing diary data. 
• If no seizures are entered in the DSD and there is a Yes response in the EDD, that day will be considered to 
have missing diary data. 
Unless specified otherwise in the relevant sections describing analyses for individual parameters, missing 
diary data will not be imputed for efficacy variables. Hence for subjects missing some of the daily 
measurements, the available data will be used. No explicit imputation will be performed for subjects who 
drop out prior to end of study (Visit 12). 
Longest Interval Between Convulsive Seizures 
For each subject, the longest interval between convulsive seizures was calculated over the entire T+M Period. 
This was derived as the maximum of the number of days between consecutive convulsive seizures. If a 
subject had 2 consecutive days of missing diary data, the current seizure-free period was ended on the first 
date of missing diary data, and a new one begun on the next date that diary data were available and no 
seizure occurred. 
Type I error control for Study 1 
A serial gatekeeping strategy was developed to control the type I error rate for pairwise comparisons 
between active and placebo groups, among the primary and key secondary efficacy parameters.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 173 subjects were screened for eligibility to participate in the study 1; of these, 119 subjects were 
randomized to study treatment in a 1:1:1 ratio (placebo: 40 subjects; ZX008 0.2 mg: 39 subjects; and 
ZX008 0.8 mg: 40 subjects). A total of 110 subjects (92.4%) completed the study (37 subjects, 92.5% 
placebo; 39 subjects, 100% ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day, and 34 subjects, 85.0% ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day).  
The completion rate was highest in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group and lowest in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day 
group. Of the 9 subjects who did not complete the study 3 were randomised to placebo and 6 were 
randomized to ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day. Reasons for premature discontinuation for the 3 subjects randomized 
to placebo were withdrawal by subject (parent or legal guardian) (2 subjects [5.0%]), and lack of efficacy (1 
subject [2.5%]). Reasons for premature discontinuation for the 6 subjects randomized to ZX008 0.8 
mg/kg/day group were AEs (5 subjects [12.5%]), and withdrawal by subject (1 subject [2.5%]). AEs leading 
to withdrawal occurred only in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group. Three subjects who exited the study 
prematurely advanced to the open-label extension study (placebo: 1 subject; 0.8 mg/kg/day: 2 subjects).  
Baseline data 
The treatment groups were balanced for age, sex, and race. Overall, the mean (SD) age was 9.0 (4.65) years. 
In all groups, the majority of subjects were ≥6 years of age. The majority of subjects in all treatment groups 
were male and the majority of all treatment groups were white.

Summary of baseline convulsive seizure frequency 
Prior Anti-Epileptic Medications/Therapies 
All  subjects  received  at  least  one  prior  AED.  Overall,  the  most  commonly  used  prior  AEDs/therapies,  were 
clobazam  (83.2%),  levetiracetam  (79.0%),  topiramate  (68.9%),  valproate  semisodium/sodium  (68.1%), 
stiripentol  (48.7%),  zonisamide  (43.7%),  phenobarbital  (40.3%),  ketogenic  diet  (37.8%),  lamotrigine 
(27.7%), cannabidiol (26.9%), clonazepam (26.9%), and valproic acid (26.1%). 
Concomitant Anti-Epileptic Medications/Therapies 
All subjects were to be receiving at least one concomitant anti-epileptic treatment during the study. Most 
subjects (97.6%) received between 1 and 4 AEDs. In addition to AEDs, 9 subjects were on the ketogenic diet 
(1 on placebo, 4 on 0.2 mg/kg/day, and 4 subjects on 0.8 mg/kg/day), and 23 subjects had a vagal nerve 
stimulator implantation (9 subjects on placebo, 8 subjects on 0.2 mg/kg/day, and 6 subjects on 0.8 
mg/kg/day). One subject in the 0.2 mg/kg/day treatment group did not receive any concomitant AED 
medication during the study but did have a vagal nerve stimulator implanted. 
Numbers analysed 
There were 5 study populations: the enrolled population, the ITT (randomised) Population, the mITT 
Population, the PP Population, and the Safety Population.  
All 119 subjects who were randomised received at least 1 dose of ZX008 or placebo and had at least 1 week 
of diary data; therefore, the ITT and mITT Populations are identical. The primary comparison of ZX008 0.8 
mg/kg/day to placebo, as well as key secondary analyses, were performed on the mITT Population. Subjects 
were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized. A total of 102 subjects were 
included in the PP population. Subjects excluded from the PP population are those with major protocol 
deviations that had the potential to impact clinical outcome (safety, efficacy, data integrity). All safety 
analyses were conducted using the Safety population, which included all 119 subjects. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: 
The primary endpoint was change from Baseline during T+M in the mean CSF per 28 days for 
the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group compared with the placebo group.

The least squares mean CSF per 28 days was 7.9 and 21.8 for the 0.8 mg/kg/day and placebo dose groups, 
respectively. The model gives an estimate of the percent difference in baseline-adjusted CSF between the 0.8 
mg/kg/day group and placebo (95% CI) of 63.9% (49.40, 74.22).

Study 1504 
Study 1504 consisted of 2 parts. The first part (Cohort 1) was an open-label study in 18 subjects with Dravet 
syndrome to assess pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety to define the dose of fenfluramine to be used in Cohort 
2, when fenfluramine was added to a regimen that included stiripentol (STP). The second part (Cohort 2) was 
a  double-blind,  randomized,  2-arm,  placebo-controlled  study  to  evaluate  ZX008  in  combination  with  STP, 
valproate (VPA) and/or clobazam (CLB). 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria in Study 1504 were similar to Study 1. The most important difference being 
the  requirement  of  stable  STP  (plus  CLB  and/or  VPA  treatment)  whereas  STP  treatment  was  an  exclusion 
criterion  in  Study  1.  A  requirement  in  Study  1  of  at  least  4  convulsive  seizures  per  4  weeks  was  not  a 
requirement in Study 1504c2. 
Treatments 
Dose to be studied included 0.5 mg/kg/day, divided into 2 daily (BID) doses, up to a maximum of 20 
mg/day. Doses were administrated in the morning and approximately 12 hours later in the evening. An 
intermediate dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day was used for titration. 
Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective was to demonstrate that ZX008 is superior to placebo for the treatment of 
Dravet syndrome in children and young adults optimized on a STP regimen based on the change in convulsive 
seizure frequency (CSF) from Baseline to the combined Titration and Maintenance periods (T+M periods). 
The secondary objectives were to demonstrate of ZX008 to placebo for the proportion of subjects who 
achieve a ≥ 50% reduction from Baseline in convulsive seizure frequency and for the longest convulsive 
seizure-free interval. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
-  Change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency (CSF) to the T+M periods. 
Key secondary endpoints: 
- 
- 
Proportion of subjects (n [%]) who achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in CSF from Baseline to the T+M period. 
Longest convulsive seizure-free interval during the T+M period (days) 
Additional secondary endpoints were number of convulsive seizure-free days, proportion of subjects with ≥ 
25% and ≥ 75% reduction from Baseline in CFS, proportion of subjects achieving complete or nearly 
complete convulsive seizure freedom, total (convulsive + nonconvulsive) seizure frequency, change from 
Baseline in CSF by seizure type, change from Baseline in frequency of all nonconvulsive seizures (all types

and by seizure type), rescue medication usage, incidence of hospitalization and other resource utilization, 
incidence of status epilepticus, duration of prolonged seizures, Clinical Global Impression (improvement 
rating by the parent/caregiver and by the principal investigator), Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy 
(QOLCE) Scale, Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Quality of Life of the Parent/Caregiver  
Sample size 
Similarly to study 1, the sample size calculation for study 1504 was derived from the stiripentol studies. This 
resulted in an initial sample size of 70 subjects required to find a treatment difference of 40% at a 5% 
significance level and with a 90% power. When the results of a phase III Epidyolex study came available the 
sample size was recalculated, using a higher SD. A sample size of approximately 80 subjects (35-40 per arm) 
was considered needed. The final determination was based on the results of Study 1 with a higher SD (58) 
and it was planned to include approximately 90 subjects (45 per arm). 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Subjects  were  randomized  (1:1)  in  a  double-blind  manner  to  receive  ZX008  (at  a  dose  of  0.5  mg/kg/day; 
maximum dose of 20 mg/day) or placebo. The randomization was stratified by age (< 6 years, ≥ 6 years) to 
ensure balance across treatment regimens and approximately 25% of subjects were in each age group. Study 
drug was provided in one concentration: 2.5 mg/mL fenfluramine HCl. 
The Titration, Maintenance, and Taper/Transition periods of the study were double-blind. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical analyses were similar to those for study 1. 
Participant flow 
A total of 115 subjects were screened for eligibility to participate in Study 1504 Cohort 2. Of these, 28 
subjects (24.3%) were screen failures (18 subjects due to ECHO findings) and 87 subjects (75.7%) were 
randomized to study treatment in a 1:1 ratio (placebo: 44 subjects; and ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day: 43 subjects). 
A total of 77 subjects (88.5%) completed the study: 41 subjects (93.2%) in the placebo group and 36 
subjects (83.7%) in the ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day group.  
Of the 10 subjects who did not complete the study, 3 subjects were in the placebo group and 7 subjects were 
in the ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day group (1 subject discontinued in the T+M period and 6 subjects discontinued in 
the Maintenance period). Reasons for premature discontinuation in the placebo group were given as an AE, 
subject with early termination due to worsening of seizures (approved by Medical Monitor and Sponsor to 
have early rollover into the open-label study), and uncontrolled seizures (1 subject [2.3%] each). Reasons 
for premature discontinuation in the ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day group were as follows: 2 subjects (4.7%) due to 
AEs and 1 subject (2.3%) in each of the following: lack of efficacy, physician decision, subject early 
termination due to worsening seizures, and withdrawal by subject. One subject in the ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day 
group discontinued early due to an ECHO finding per Sponsor request when an investigation of a mild mitral 
regurgitation (MR) report at Visit 8 revealed that mild mitral regurgitation had been present at an initial

Screening ECHO but was not identified at a subsequent rescreening ECHO, which allowed the subject to be 
inappropriately enrolled into the study. 
Baseline data 
The treatment groups were balanced for age, sex, and race. Overall, the mean (SD) age was 9.1 (4.80) years. 
In each group, the majority of subjects were ≥ 6 years of age. Over half of the subjects in each treatment group 
were male and, where reported, over half of the subjects in each group were white.

Summary of baseline convulsive seizure frequency 
Concomitant Antiepileptic Medications/Therapies 
All subjects were to have been receiving at a minimum STP plus CLB and/or VPA during the study. Table 16 
summarizes the number of concomitant AEDs taken by subjects by treatment group for the Safety 
Population. All subjects received at least 2 AEDs; most subjects received 3 or 4 AEDs (51.7% and 36.8%, 
respectively). There were more subjects in the ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day group receiving 5 AEDs (7 subjects) 
compared to the placebo group (1 subject). This smaller cohort of subjects receiving such a level of 
polypharmacy of 5 AEDs could be considered as more refractory than the other subjects on fewer AEDs and 
were more heavily weighted toward the ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day group. 
Numbers analysed 
There were 5 study populations: the enrolled population, the ITT (randomised) Population, the mITT 
Population, the PP Population, and the Safety Population.  
A total of 115 subjects were included in the enrolled population. All 87 subjects who were randomized to 
receive ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day or placebo received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 week of 
diary data; therefore, the ITT, Safety, and mITT Populations were identical. The primary comparison of 
ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day to placebo, as well as key secondary analyses, were performed for the mITT 
Population. Subjects were analysed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized. A total 
of 73 subjects were included in the PP Population. Subjects excluded from the PP Population were those with 
MPDs that had the potential to impact clinical outcome (safety, efficacy, or data integrity) or those who did 
not complete at least 4 weeks of the Maintenance period. All safety analyses were conducted using the Safety 
Population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: 
The  primary  objective  of  Study  1504  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  ZX008  0.5  mg/kg/day  (maximum  20 
mg/day)  versus  placebo  in  reducing  convulsive  seizures  over  the  15-week  Treatment  period.  Seizure  types 
contributing  to  the  primary  endpoint  were  GTC,  secondarily  GTC,  clonic,  drop  seizures  (tonic-atonic), 
hemiclonic, and focal seizures with a clear and observable motor component. 
The primary analysis estimated that subjects randomized to ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day achieved a 54.0% (95% 
CI: 35.6%, 67.2%) greater reduction in monthly CSF between the Baseline period and the T+M period than 
subjects randomised to placebo (P < 0.001).

ZX008-Study 1 
IND 125797 
EudraCT 2015-004167-37 
Study 1 is the prospective, merged analysis of 2 identical double-blind, placebo-
controlled  studies,  ZX008-1501  and  ZX008-1502.  Study  1501  and  Study  1502 
are being conducted in parallel. 
After  obtaining  informed  consent/assent,  subjects  entered  a  6-week  Baseline 
Period.  This  period  consisted  of  the  establishment  of  initial  eligibility  during  a 
screening  visit  followed by  an observation period  when  subjects  were  assessed 
for baseline seizure activity based on recordings of daily seizure activity entered 
into  an  electronic  diary.  Upon  completion  of  the  Baseline  Period,  subjects  who 
qualified  for  the  study  were  randomized  (1:1:1)  in  a  double-blind  manner  to 
receive 1 of 2 doses of ZX008 (0.2 mg/kg/day, 0.8 mg/kg/day; maximum dose: 
30  mg/day)  or  placebo.  Randomization  was  stratified  by  age  (<  6  years,  ≥  6 
years)  to  achieve  balance  across  treatment  arms,  with  the  target  of  25%  of 
subjects in each age group. 
All subjects were titrated in a blinded fashion to their randomized dose over a 2-
week  Titration  Period.  Following titration,  subjects continued treatment at their 
randomly assigned dose during a 12-week Maintenance Period. For subjects who 
completed the full Titration and Maintenance Periods (T+M) total treatment time 
was 14 weeks. At the end of the Maintenance Period (or early discontinuation), 
all  subjects  underwent  a  2-week  blinded  taper  or  transition  (Taper/Transition 
Period),  depending  on  whether  they  exited  the  study  or  were  enrolled  in  the 
subsequent  long-term  open-label  extension  study.  Parents/caregivers  used  an 
electronic diary every day during study participation to record the number/type 
of seizures, dosing, and use of rescue medication.

Notes 
A total of 173 subjects were screened for eligibility to participate in this study; of 
these,  119  subjects  were  randomized  to  study  treatment  in  a  1:1:1  ratio 
(placebo:  40  subjects;  ZX008  0.2  mg:  39  subjects;  and  ZX008  0.8  mg:  40 
subjects).  
A  total  of  110  subjects  (92.4%)  completed  the  study  (37  subjects,  92.5% 
placebo;  39  subjects,  100%  ZX008  0.2  mg/kg/day,  and  34  subjects,  85.0% 
ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day).  
Of the 9 subjects who did not complete the study 3 were randomized to placebo 
and 6 were randomized to ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day.  
Reasons for premature discontinuation for the 3 subjects randomized to placebo 
were  withdrawal  by  subject  (ie,  parent or legal guardian)  (2  subjects  [5.0%]), 
and lack of efficacy (1 subject [2.5%]).  
Reasons for premature discontinuation for the 6 subjects randomized to ZX008 
0.8 mg/kg/day group were AEs (5 subjects [12.5%]), and withdrawal by subject 
(1  subject  [2.5%]).  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  occurred  only  in  the  ZX008  0.8 
mg/kg/day group.

ZX008  when  added  to  standard-of-care  treatment  that  included  stiripentol 
(STP) in the treatment of seizures in children and young adults with Dravet 
syndrome.  PK  and  safety  data  from  Study  1504  Cohort  1  from  18  subjects 
were  collected  and  evaluated  together  with  data  from  Study  ZX008-1505 
(healthy  volunteer  drug-drug  interaction  study)  and  informed  the  dose  of 
ZX008  (0.5  mg/kg/day,  maximum  20  mg/day)  to  be  used  in  Study  1504 
Cohort 2.  
Design 
After obtaining informed consent/assent, subjects entered a 6-week Baseline 
Period. This period consisted of the establishment of initial eligibility during a 
screening visit followed by an observation period when subjects were assessed 
for  baseline  seizure  activity  based  on  recordings  of  daily  seizure  activity 
entered  into  an  electronic  diary.  Upon  completion  of  the  baseline  period, 
subjects who qualified for the study were randomized (1:1) in a double-blind 
manner to receive ZX008 (at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day; maximum dose of 20 
mg/day) or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age group (< 6 years, ≥ 
6 years) to ensure balance across treatment arms with at least approximately 
25% of subjects in each age group.

All subjects were titrated in a blinded fashion to their randomized dose over a 
3-week  Titration  Period. Following titration, subjects  continued treatment at 
their  randomly  assigned  dose  during  a  12-week  Maintenance  Period.  For 
subjects who completed the full Titration and Maintenance Periods (T+M) total 
treatment time was 15 weeks. At the end of the Maintenance Period (or early 
discontinuation), all subjects underwent a 2-week blinded taper or transition 
(Taper/Transition Period), depending on whether they exited the study or were 
enrolled

Notes 
A  total  of  87  subjects  in  Study  1504  Cohort  2  were  randomized  to  study 
treatment in a 1:1 ratio (placebo: 44 subjects; and ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day: 43 
subjects) and received study drug.  
Overall, 77 subjects (88.5%) completed the study. Of the 10 subjects who did 
not complete the study, 3 subjects were in the placebo group and 7 subjects 
were in the ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day group.  
Reasons  for  premature  discontinuation  in  the  placebo  group  were  1  subject 
(2.3%) with an adverse event of seizures, 1 subject (2.3%) with worsening of 
seizures, and 1 subject (2.3%) with uncontrolled seizures.  
Reasons  for  premature  discontinuation  in  the  ZX008  0.5  mg/kg/day  group 
were as follows: 2 subjects (4.7%) due to AEs, 1 subject (2.3%) in each of the 
following: lack of efficacy, physician decision, subject early termination due to 
worsening  seizures,  and  withdrawal  by  subject.  The  seventh  subject  with 
premature discontinuation in the ZX008 0.5mg/kg/day group was Subject No.

0201-84  was  discontinued  early  per  Sponsor  due  to  inappropriate  study 
enrollment - mild mitral regurgitation present at an initial Screening ECHO, but

Study 1503 – Open Label Extension  
Additional data from Study 1503, the ongoing open-label extension study for subjects from Study 1, Study 2 
and  Study  1504,  is  provided  as  supportive  data.  Subjects  who had  received  at  least  1  month  of  open-label 
treatment at the time of the Study 1503 data cut-off on 14 October 2019 were included in the interim clinical 
study report. The primary objective of Study 1503 is long-term safety and tolerability of fenfluramine.  
330 patients enrolled in the study with a variety in time included (304/330 patients received fenfluramine for 
6  months  or  longer  and  282/330  have  received  fenfluramine  for  1  year  or  longer  in  the  OLE  Study).  228 
(69.1%)  of  the  patients  are  still  included,  27  (8.2%)  patients  transitioned  to  Study  1900  (the  continuation 
open-label study) and continue to receive fenfluramine, and 75 (22.7%) patients discontinued from OLE Study 
1503. Of the 75 patients who discontinued, the majority discontinued because of lack of efficacy 48/75 (64%). 
Continuation of treatment in this OLE-study is no evidence of efficacy in the long term.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data from the 2 completed studies (Study 1 and Study 1504 Cohort 2), and an interim analysis of the 
long-term extension study (Study 1503) were included in the application and discussed. 
Due  to  slow  enrolment,  Study  1  was  a  combined  analysis  of  studies  1501  and  1502,  nearly  identical  trials 
running in North America and Europe/Australia respectively. The first N=119 subjects randomised from either 
trial comprised Study 1. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
For both studies, the patient population studied is considered overall representative of the intended target 
population although inclusion of patients younger than 2 years would have been preferable and there is very 
limited data in the adult population. The diagnosis was based on clinical criteria and both patients with and 
without genetic confirmation were included.  
Regarding the endpoint structure, there was some deviations from guideline requirements, but it is 
considered overall acceptable and in accordance with CHMP advice previously provided. 
Whereas the design of the individual studies 1501, 1502 and 1504c2 appears adequate, Study 1 is the pooled 
analysis of studies 1501 and 1502. This was not described in a protocol. In addition, a number of study 
conduct breaches were identified (retrospective data collection, arbitrary selection of number of seizures for 
cluster seizures, problems with data transfer, queries not solved, rescreened patients etc.). A GCP inspection 
was therefore requested and several deviations, including some critical, were made. Sensitivity analyses 
regarding missing data, cluster values, and GCP violations were therefore requested during the assessment. 
The impact of the study conduct breaches on the results of the 0.5 and 0.8 mg/kg/day was found to be small, 
but the results for the 0.2 mg/kg/day were considered less robust. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In both studies, Fintepla treatment was associated with a reduction of convulsive seizure frequency. 
In Study 1, the primary endpoint was met with a convulsive seizure frequency reduction from 32.95 to 18.89 
in the 0.8 mg/kg/day group as compared to a reduction from 46.07 to 40.56 in the placebo group. The 
clinical relevance of the reduction was supported by the 50% responder analysis where 70% of the patients 
on 0.8 mg/kg/day achieved a 50% reduction as compared to 7.5% of patients on placebo. However, since 
patients were not on stiripentol, a caveat regarding clinical relevance is whether a comparable effect could 
have been achieved by optimising AED treatment, including by stiripentol.  
It was observed that the odds ratio for the secondary endpoint varies considerably in the sensitivity analyses, 
which makes this estimate not reliable. It is also of concern that there was no improvement on clinically 
relevant outcome measures such as risk of prolonged seizures or status epilepticus. In fact, the percentage of 
patients with status epilepticus was higher on active treatment (35% for patients on 0.8 mg/kg/day) than on 
placebo (25%). Similarly, the probability of a seizure being of more than 10 minutes duration was 4.82 in the 
0.8 mg/kg/day arm as compared to 2.38 in the placebo arm. 
Regarding the 0.2 mg/kg/day dose, it appears that this is a suboptimal dose, supported with less robust 
data. However, this is noted that it is not the intended treatment maintenance dose and in clinical practice 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 70/101 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
patients will be titrated upon response and tolerability. Therefore, the level of evidence provided for this dose 
and the less robust data regarding efficacy are accepted.  
In Study 1504, the primary endpoint was also met. The mean CSF was 21.62 at baseline and 20.97 at the 
end of the T+M period for the placebo group, whereas the mean CSF decreased from 27.90 at baseline to 
24.72 at the end of the T+M period for the active group (a 54.0% (95% CI: 35.6%, 67.2%) greater 
reduction for the active group). The clinical relevance of the reduction was supported by the 50% responder 
analysis where 53.5% of the patients on 0.5 mg/kg/day achieved a 50% reduction as compared to 4.5% of 
patients on placebo. The CHMP noted however that, similarly to study 1, there was an increased incidence of 
status epilepticus in the active arm (32.6%) as compared to the placebo arm (18.2%). 
There was very limited data presented for the adult population. Data on a subgroup of 7 patients who were 
18-19 years of age at time of first dose administration in double-blind Studies 1 and 1504 were discussed (4 
patients in placebo group, 1 in 0.5mg/kg fenfluramine and 2 in 0.8mg/kg fenfluramine). In the placebo group 
(n=4) the % change in CSF range +18.0 to – 36%. In the fenfluramine group (n=3) the % change from 
baseline in CSF range from -67.4% to -96.1%. These limited data support to some degree the efficacy in in 
fenfluramine naïve adults. During the oral explanation, the Applicant presented data on seizure type and 
frequency across age groups from infants to adults with Dravet syndrome confirming a high seizure burden 
and overall comparable distribution of seizure types independent of age (Lagae 2018). In addition, limited 
data from adolescents/young adults suggest efficacy in adults. Taking together the similarity of seizure 
burden and seizure types in adult compared to paediatric patients with Dravet syndrome and at least some 
evidence from the clinical studies that fenfluramine also works in adult patients, the CHMP concluded that 
extrapolation of efficacy is possible. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Fintepla, as add-on therapy to other AEDs, in children with Dravet Syndrome is supported by 
2 randomised, double-blind studies. In both studies, Fintepla treatment was associated with a reduction of 
convulsive seizure frequency. The CHMP agreed that the available data support the efficacy in the use of 
Fintepla as add-on therapy to other AEDs, in children with Dravet Syndrome from 2 years of age and older. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Exposure in controlled studies:  
Overall, 112 patients were exposed to ZX008 in the 2 double-blind studies (N=79 from study 1, N=43 from 
study 1504). The duration of these trials was 2-weeks titration, 12-weeks treatment, and 2-3 weeks tapper, 
so overall 16-17 weeks.  
Exposure in open-label extension:  
330 patients had been exposed to target doses of ZX008 in the open-label extension study, with 282 patients 
exposed for more than 12 months and 128 patients exposed for more than 24 months. It is however noted 
that data on patients from study 2 (an on-going phase 3 study still blinded) who entered the open-label study 
are not yet available for evaluation as this study has not been unlocked. 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 71/101 
 
  
  
Demographics 
The included patients had a mean age of approx. 9 years in the phase 3 studies and 11 years in the open-
label extension. More males (55%) than females (45%) were included reflecting a male-to-female ratio 
above one in DS. Baseline characteristics such as weight, height, ratio of races, and concomitant antiepileptic 
treatment were balanced between placebo and treatment groups. 
Adverse events  
Adverse events were more common in ZX008-groups than in the placebo groups. However, taking the time 
on study into consideration, the number of AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs was relatively 
constant. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs were decreased appetite (34.4% ZX008 vs. 8.3% placebo respectively), 
nasopharyngitis (14.8% vs. 23.8%), echocardiogram abnormal (16.4% vs. 6.0%), lethargy (13.9% vs. 4.8%), 
seizure  (7.4%  vs.  14.3%),  somnolence  (10.7%  vs.  7.1%),  pyrexia  (16.4%  vs.  14.3%),  fatigue  (15.6%  vs. 
3.6%) and diarrhoea (23.8% vs. 7.1%).

Common adverse events: 
Nervous system disorders were more common in the ZX008 groups than in the placebo group; especially the 
incidences of lethargy (14% vs. 5%), somnolence (11% vs. 7%), and status epilepticus (7 % vs. 2%). 
Psychiatric disorders occurred more often in the ZX008 groups than in the placebo group (25% vs. 7%), 
including PTs abnormal behaviour (6% vs. 1%) and irritability 4% vs. 2%. 
Adverse events related to appetite regulation were also more frequent in the ZX008 group: decreased 
appetite (34% vs. 8%) and weight decreased (9% vs. 1%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 73/101 
 
  
  
 
 
 
ECG changes were reported more often in the ZX008 group: 16% vs. 6%, as well as increased heart rate 4% 
vs. 2%. 
Within the ZX008 dosing regimens, the following AEs occurred with a higher frequency in patients who 
received the ≥0.6-<0.8 mg/kg/day at the time of onset (% in patients receiving ≥0.2-<0.4 mg/kg/day vs. 
≥0.4-<0.6 mg/kg/day vs. patients receiving ≥0.6-<0.8 mg/kg/day): Diarrhoea (5% vs. 3% vs. 9%), 
vomiting (4% vs. 1% vs. 10%), pyrexia (9% vs. 4% vs. 19%), blood glucose decreased (1% vs. 3% vs. 
6%), echocardiogram abnormal (4% vs. 4% vs. 14%), decreased appetite (8% vs. 5% vs. 12%), seizures 
(5% vs. 2% vs. 10%). 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
The adverse events of special interest comprise valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH), seizures, weight decrease, changes of blood glucose and prolactin. 
Valvular heart disease 
Regurgitation has been evaluated by regular echocardiogram investigation. Mainly trace regurgitation was 
found, trace mitral valve regurgitation was most commonly reported. For all types of regurgitation, an 
oscillation between absent and trace regurgitation was reported. As per protocol, no patients with trace or 
higher degrees of valvular heart disease were included in the studies. 
Mitral valve 
The results of the double-blind studies show a higher incidence of mitral valve trace regurgitation in the 
ZX008 groups as compared to placebo (21% in the ZX008 groups vs. 10% in the placebo group).  
No subject had a reading of ‘moderate’ or greater mitral regurgitation, and differences between the active 
treatment groups and placebo were driven by ‘trace regurgitation’. 
In the open-label extension of the studies, the overall frequency of Trace or greater mitral regurgitation was 
32%. Review of the data by original core study treatment cohort shows the incidence ranges from 12/55 
(22%) in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day-OLE group, to 16/36 (44%) in the 0.8 mg/kg/day-OLE group.  
Aortic, tricuspid, pulmonic valves and PAH 
There were 4 subjects which experienced an abnormal aortic valve regurgitation. In 2 subjects, trace mitral 
and  trace  aortic  valve  regurgitation  was  reported  concomitantly,  but  this  was  absent  in  subsequent 
echocardiograms. These 2 subjects continued treatment. The 2 other subjects discontinued following mild aortic 
regurgitation  and  trace  aortic  regurgitation.  For  both  these  subjects,  follow-up  echocardiograms  showed 
absence of regurgitation, which is reassuring.  
There were no signs of regurgitation over the tricuspid and pulmonic valves. Similarly, there was no sign of 
increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), which, of note, was a very rare AE to the previous use 
of fenfluramine in the treatment of obesity.

Dose-response and time-response: 
With regard to valvular heart disease, no data to allow an investigation of a possible dose-response or time-
response relationship in the full safety analyses set was provided. However, the following frequencies of 
‘echocardiogram abnormal’ have been reported in patients who entered the open-label extension from the 
completed phase 3 studies. ‘Echocardiogram abnormal’ by dose at onset was 0% in the 0-<0.2 mg/kg/day 
group; 3.5% in the ≥0.2-<0.4 mg/kg/day group; 4.3% in the ≥0.4-<0.6 mg/kg/day group; and 13.6% in 
the ≥0.6-<0.8 mg/kg/day group. 
During the assessment, the Applicant conducted a series of analyses of potential correlations of the AE 
‘echocardiogram abnormal’ with various definitions of the dose levels associated with the occurrence of this 
AE.  It was however difficult to assess the potential correlation of the AE ‘echocardiogram abnormal’ with the 
relevant dose levels across the entire data set.  
Cardiac conduction 
There were no observable changes in QTc or QRS duration and treatment with fenfluramine did not influence 
the repolarisation of the heart.  
Fenfluramine seems to influence the heart rate. Both HR increases and decreases were noted with changes of 
>10->20 bpm in the treatment groups. Some patients also experienced an increase of the PR-interval; the 
maximally recorded increases being 20-35 msec in patients aged 2-6 years and 6-12 years, respectively. 
Decreased appetite and weight loss 
Decreased appetite and hypophagia are known effects of fenfluramine. Among the 45/122 (36.9%) subjects 
in any ZX008 treatment group, who reported decreased appetite, 26/45 (57.8%) subjects had these events 
ongoing at the end of the double-blind treatment period.  
A comparison of the ZX008 0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg/day doses from Study 1 showed a dose response with 
increased frequency of reporting for decreased appetite with increased dose levels of ZX008 (0.2 mg/kg/day: 
9 [21.3%] and 0.8 mg/kg/day 15 [37.5%]). 
At the end of the double-blind treatment period, in the placebo, ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day, 0.5 mg/kg/day, and 
0.8 mg/kg/day groups, 2 (2.4%), 5 (12.8%), 8 (18.6%), and 10 (26.3%) subjects had lost ≥ 7% of their 
baseline body weight while 13 (15.7%), 1 (2.6%), 2 (4.7%), and 0 (0.0%) had gained ≥ 7% of their baseline 
body weight respectively. 
Blood glucose decrease 
Blood glucose decreased was reported in 6 (14.0%) subjects randomized to ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day + STP and 
2 (2.4%) subjects in the combined placebo group, and 11 (6.3%) subjects in open-label extension Study 
1503. 
Among the 174 patients, who entered the open-label extension study from the completed phase 3 studies, 
the following AEs of ‘blood glucose decreased’ were reported:  0% in the 0-<0.2 mg/kg/day group; 1% in the 
≥0.2-<0.4 mg/kg/day group; 3% in the ≥0.4-<0.6 mg/kg/day group; and 6% in the ≥0.6-<0.8 mg/kg/day 
group.

Page 75/101 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The most recent analysis of the open-label extension study however did not show any clear dose related 
increase in the AEs of reduced blood glucose and hypoglycemia.  
It is accepted that all the AEs of blood glucose decreased or hypoglycemia were mild, transient in nature, and 
all resolved without treatment.  
Seizures and Seizure-Related Events 
Seizures were reported as AEs in 12% of the population who were enrolled in the open-label extension study. 
The frequency of patients who reported an AE of seizure was highest in the ≥ 0.6 - ≤0.8 mg/kg/day group; 
N=10, 10%.   
In same population, although only reported for the time in controlled studies, the incidence rate of status 
epilepticus (SE) was higher in the ZX008 groups than the placebo group as shown in the table below. 
Table 8: Incidence Rate Serious Adverse Events During Double-blind Treatment Period by MedDRA 
system Organ Class and Preferred Term; ISS-DB-SAF Population 
A number of additional analyses in various data sets on the incidence of seizures and SE was presented and it 
appears that the relationship between fenfluramine, concomitant STP and the occurrence of seizure/status 
epilepticus is clear.  
Prolactin increase 
Elevation in prolactin level has been previously associated with fenfluramine and seizures in epilepsy. There 
was a small dose-dependent increase of prolactin levels during treatment with ZX008. The increases were 
independent of recent seizure frequency as the tests were taken at least 48 hours after the last seizure.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Three deaths (a 2-year old male, a 8-year old female and a 5-year old male) were reported during the clinical 
development programme. None of them were assessed as related to study medication. The medical monitor 
agreed with the investigator’s assessment of causality. 
Serious adverse events 
The incidence of serious TEAEs was similar in subjects randomized to ZX008 compared to subjects 
randomized to placebo. Overall, 15 (12.3%) subjects in any ZX008 treatment group compared to 11 (13.1%) 
subjects in the combined placebo group reported at least 1 serious TEAE.

Laboratory findings 
Platelet count 
In the studies, at visit 12, the mean platelet counts (10^9/L) decreased slightly from baseline for all ZX008 
treatment groups. 
Chemistry 
Slight decreases from baseline in mean and median liver function tests including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), as well as cholesterol and creatine 
kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were observed in the ZX008 treatment groups compared to the 
combined placebo group although mean and median values remained within the normal reference ranges. 
Urinalyses 
There were no clinically important changes.

Overall in male subjects, 64 (97.0%) subjects in any ZX008 treatment group compared to 40 (83.3%) 
subjects in the combined placebo group reported at least 1 TEAE. In female subjects, 53 (94.6%) subjects in 
any ZX008 treatment group compared to 28 (77.8%) subjects in the combined placebo group reported at 
least 1 TEAE. 
Concomitant treatment with stiripentol 
A greater proportion of subjects not treated with concomitant STP reported echocardiogram abnormal, 
although all findings were non-pathologic and mostly trace regurgitation; (13 [35.1%] in the combined 
placebo group and 23 [32.9%] in any ZX008 treatment group) compared to subjects treated with 
concomitant STP (2 [7.4%] in the combined placebo group and 4 [16.7%] in any ZX008 treatment group).  
A greater proportion of subjects treated with concomitant STP reported decreased appetite (12 44.4%] in the 
combined placebo group and 13 [54.2%] in any ZX008 treatment group) compared to subjects not treated 
with concomitant STP (8 [21.6%] in the combined placebo group and 27 [38.6%] in any ZX008 treatment 
group). This finding is not unexpected since decreased appetite is a known AE associated with STP.

Pregnancy and lactation 
There are limited literature data on the use of fenfluramine during pregnancy and lactation. There were no 
patients who were pregnant or breast feeding in the clinical studies.  
Overdose 
Over-dosing errors have been reported in 4 subjects that resulted in doses of ≥ 1.0 mg/kg/day for varied 
periods of time due to either caregiver error, incorrect weight used in the interactive web response system, 
site error in providing correct dose or dosing instructions, and availability of drug. In subjects that received 
more than 1.0 mg/kg/day dosing, 1 TEAE (weight loss) was deemed related to the study drug and was also 
temporally related with dosing error. 
Only limited data have been reported concerning clinical effects and management of overdosage of 
fenfluramine. Agitation and drowsiness, confusion, flushing, tremor (or shivering), fever, sweating, abdominal 
pain, hyperventilation, and dilated nonreactive pupils seem frequent in fenfluramine overdosage. Reflexes 
may be either exaggerated or depressed and some subjects may have rotary nystagmus. Tachycardia may 
be present, but blood pressure may be normal or only slightly elevated. Convulsions, coma, and ventricular 
extrasystoles, culminating in ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest, may occur at higher dosages. Less 
than 5 mg/kg fenfluramine is associated with toxicity in humans with 5 to 10 mg/kg producing coma and 
convulsions (von Muhlendahl 1979). 
Drug Abuse 
Fenfluramine does not have properties associated with abuse potential. Nonclinical studies data are 
consistent in showing that fenfluramine does not exhibit abuse potential and human abuse liability studies 
have demonstrated that fenfluramine does not possess significant abuse potential, even at high doses. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
A review of TEAE with onset during the Transition/Taper period of the double-blind and Month 1 of the open-
label extension study in ≥ 2% of subjects in the LTS-DB Population has been conducted. The number of 
subjects reporting TEAEs during the Transition/Taper period was similar for subjects randomized to ZX008 
compared to subjects randomized to placebo. During this time period, increased seizures occurred in 6.3% of 
placebo subjects, 2.6% in the 0.2mg/kg/day ZX008 group, 0% in the ZX008 0.5mg/kg/day group, and 5.7% 
in the ZX008 0.8mg/kg/day group. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
Compounds such as ZX008 which may cause lethargy, somnolence, and/or fatigue, should be used with 
caution if driving or operating machinery. 
Immunological events 
Experience from the previous treatment of obesity indication does not indicate a risk of immunological events 
for ZX008. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
ZX008 causes a release of serotonin and the interaction with serotonergic drugs leading to an increased risk 
of serotonin syndrome is possible. 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 79/101 
 
  
  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Across the treatment arms, 11 subjects (3/5%) discontinued the study due to an adverse event. The highest 
frequency of adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in the 0.2 mg/kg/day group. This may be 
driven by subjects who received placebo previously and just started fenfluramine dosing. Abnormal behaviour 
appears to be the most common reason in the 0.2 mg/kg/day group (n= 3, 6.8%). Across the other dosing 
groups there does not appear to be a particular adverse event leading more frequently to discontinuation 
over others. 
Post marketing experience 
ZX008 has not been previously marketed for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in 
patients 2 years of age and older in any country. 
Fenfluramine was previously marketed and prescribed in doses of 60 to 120 mg/day for the treatment of 
obesity in adults and was withdrawn from the US and European Union (EU) markets in 1997 due to the risk 
of development of valvular heart disease. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database comprises patients from the two completed phase 3 studies, one ongoing phase 3 study 
and an ongoing open-label extension study. The phase 3 studies have a duration of 16-17 weeks including 
up-titration and tapper-period. Therefore, the majority of the safety data derives from the open-label study. 
Overall, 112 patients were exposed to ZX008 in the double-blind studies and, following additional safety 
analyses provided during the assessment, 341 patients in the open-label extension (including 284 patients 
exposed for more than 12 months and 138 patients exposed for more than 24 months). Even in view of 
Dravet Syndrome being an orphan disease, the size of safety database is considered small as it only allows 
identification of adverse events with a high frequency or with an incidence markedly different from the 
background population.  
Adverse events 
Between 90 and 98% of the patients experienced at least one TEAE. The incidence of serious TEAEs was 
similar in subjects randomized to ZX008 compared to subjects randomized to placebo. Overall, 15 (12.3%) 
subjects in any ZX008 treatment group compared to 11 (13.1%) subjects in the combined placebo group 
reported at least 1 serious TEAE.  
In the open-label extension study data, which has been presented this far, the risk of seizure-AEs was 12%, 
with the highest frequency of events occurring in the ≥ 0.6 - ≤0.8 mg/kg/day group.  
The relationship between fenfluramine treatment, concomitant STP and the increased seizures 
frequency/status epilepticus was further discussed. It was recognized that the numbers reported are low. 
However, considering that the nature of the increased seizures frequency/status epilepticus cannot be 
determined and given the severity of the adverse event, the CHMP agreed that prescribers should be 
informed. A warning is therefore included in section 4.4 of the SmPC on possible increased seizures 
frequency. In addition, a subheading regarding status epilepticus, with the observed incidence, is added in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 80/101 
 
  
  
The Applicant also provided data on AEs in the most commonly used anti-epileptic drug (AED) combinations: 
ZX008/clobazam/valproate, ZX008/clobazam/stiripentol and ZX008/valproate/stiripentol. Higher incidences 
were reported for somnolence, weight decreased and decreased appetite when the AED combinations were 
used comparing to when not used. This was further discussed, and the analyses showed a higher incidence of 
decreased appetite when the AED combinations were used. A warning regarding the higher incidence of 
decreased appetite and weight loss when fenfluramine is combined with other antiepileptic drugs, for 
example stiripentol, is therefore added in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Cardiovascular safety 
ZX008 is known to cause cardiac valvulopathy and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients treated 
for obesity, albeit by an unknown mechanism. According to the literature, the risk of valvulopathy and PAH 
increased with increasing exposure time. The dose-levels used to support the DS indication were between 2 
and 4 times lower than the dose-levels used in adults in the treatment of obesity. It is however recognized 
that the treatment duration of DS patients may be longer and the short duration of the double-blind studies 
(overall 16-17 weeks) is an issue regarding the safety concern of cardiac valvulopathy, which is likely to 
occur with increasing incidence over time. The frequency of the valvulopathy events may also be below the 
detection limits of the current safety data. 
During the development programme, the patients underwent an extensive echocardiographic evaluation and 
mainly trace regurgitation was observed. In the double-blind studies, trace regurgitation of the mitral valve 
was observed twice as often in the ZX008 groups as in the placebo group (21% vs. 10%). During the open-
label extension study, mitral trace regurgitation was observed in between 20 and 27% of the population.  
Additional supportive safety information from the open-label observational Belgian Cohort (ZXIIS2015-004) 
were provided as two publications (2012 and 2016, with treatment duration is roughly 1 up to 27 years). 
There were 4 subjects whose most recent echocardiogram indicated some structural changes, of which 3 did 
not experience any dysfunction. These patients were from the original Belgian cohort, where subjects were 
treated with fenfluramine with the range of 10 years up to 31 years. In these cases, the structural changes 
appear to remain stable. The other subject with structural changes is from the prospective cohort. These 4 
subjects are currently stable on a low dose of fenfluramine. As all these subjects have been treated for a long 
time and even though no dysfunction is observed, the uncertainty remains that cumulative exposure to 
fenfluramine may lead to abnormalities on the echocardiogram rather than the dosage used.  
The potential risk of VHD and PAH is recognized, and considering the remaining uncertainties regarding 
cardiovascular risk, it is agreed that further and more robust data regarding the long-term cardiac safety 
profile is key to consolidate the current safety profile of Fintepla in the DS indication. An imposed category 1 
PASS registry, with a focus on characterising and quantifying the important potential risks VHD and PAH, is 
therefore agreed. It will collect data on the frequency of echocardiographic monitoring to contribute to the 
assessment of the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures. Growth retardation, another potential 
important risk (see below) will also be evaluated in the agreed PASS registry.  
Echocardiogram monitoring 
With respect to the cardiac valvulopathy and possible development of PAH, an echocardiogram monitoring 
programme is proposed. Further analyses of potential correlations of the AE ‘echocardiogram abnormal’ with 
dose level were provided. Most of the analyses presented did not show any clear correlation to increasing 
dose. It is also acknowledged that the echocardiogram findings of trace regurgitation are common and 
usually non-pathological. The CHMP therefore agreed that for all patients, irrespective of the doses, 
echocardiogram monitoring should be performed every 6 months for the first two years and annually 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 81/101 
 
  
  
thereafter if symptoms and echocardiography suggest consistently low probability of pulmonary hypertension 
on serial testing. Patients who discontinue fenfluramine treatment will be followed up until 6 months after 
treatment.  
Regarding the prevention of the PAH risk, the CHMP also agreed with the proposed guidance on decision 
criteria for stopping the treatment if echocardiogram findings are suggestive of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension as described in the SmPC section 4.4, with a repeat echocardiogram as soon as possible and 
within 3 months to confirm the findings., and - if the echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an 
increased probability of PAH defined as “intermediate probability” by the 2015 European Society of Cardiology 
(ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines - it should lead to a benefit-risk evaluation of 
continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber, carer, and cardiologist. If the echocardiogram finding, after 
confirmation, suggests of a high probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension, as defined by the 2015 ESC 
and ERS Guidelines, it is recommended fenfluramine treatment should be stopped. 
The CHMP also agreed with the Applicant that physicians’ adherence to the echocardiogram monitoring plan 
should be assessed via a category 3 study on the effectiveness of risk minimisation measures so appropriate 
actions can be taken if adherence is low. In addition, the evaluation of the echocardiogram monitoring 
compliance is added in the category 1 imposed registry PASS as secondary objective.  
In conclusion, the cardiac safety risk of Fintepla is recognised. It is appropriately addressed in the RMP and 
the Product Information, including the echocardiogram monitoring program. An imposed PASS registry will 
provide further and more robust data regarding the long-term cardiac safety of Fintepla, including the 
important potential risks VHD and PAH. 
In addition, as the benefit-risk from potential off-label use in weight management with higher doses is known 
to be negative, a controlled access programme (CAP) is to be implemented in order to prevent off-label use 
and to ensure regular cardiac monitoring. 
Adverse events of special interest (other than cardiac) 
Decreased appetite, weight loss and height 
Adverse events related to appetite regulation and weight loss were more frequent in the ZX008 group: 
Decreased appetite 34% vs. 8% and weight decreased 9% vs. 1%.  
The highest number of events regarding decreased appetite and hypophagia were reported in the 
fenfluramine + stiripentol group. For the other fenfluramine groups, a dose-related effect could be observed. 
In both the double-blind and open-label extension studies, these events took an average of 40 days to 
resolve, and in both populations approximately half of the patients did not have the event resolved at the end 
of the study or interim cut-off point for the open-label extension study. Additionally, decreased glucose levels 
were noted more commonly in the ZX008 group as compared to the placebo group. The decreased appetite 
and weight loss are appropriately addressed in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
It is noted that weight decrease associated with fenfluramine treatment was reported infrequently in the 
double-blind studies and does not appear to be related to reporting of decreased appetite. Further analysis on 
data available up to 24 months were provided by the Applicant. The subjects treated with fenfluramine do not 
experience a greater impairment of growth in terms of height. However, as data over 2 years is limited, the 
CHMP agreed that further data are needed to evaluate the impact of fenfluramine treatment on growth. 
Accordingly, growth retardation is a secondary objective of the imposed category 1 PASS registry. 
Cognition 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 82/101 
 
  
  
Based on analysis with the Behaviour Rating Instrument of Executive Function (BRIEF) and BRIEF2 
instruments, there are apparently no negative effects on cognition following fenfluramine administration in 
both the double-blind and long-term extension studies.  
Prolactin increase 
Prolactin levels increased after fenfluramine administration were observed in the double-blind studies. 
However, the levels of prolactin did not deviate much from the normal range and did not appear to have any 
clinical impact. 
Decreased platelet count 
In the studies, decrease in platelet count was more frequently observed in the fenfluramine groups compared 
to the pooled placebo group. Concomitant use with valproate also resulted in a decreased platelet count in a 
few patients. The decreases were however small and most subjects remained within the reference range. 
Laboratory values 
Evaluation of possible changes in growth hormones, precocious puberty, thyroid function and Tanner staging 
revealed that these conditions are not influenced by longer-term treatment with fenfluramine.  
Special populations and drug-drug interactions 
Being a selective serotonin releasing agent, the risk of serotonin syndrome may be increased when used in 
combination with similar medicinal products. This is correctly addressed in the SmPC with a statement in 
section 4.4.  
Supportive safety data 
Withdrawals and abuse potential 
There was no pattern of withdrawals or abuse potentials among the reported events.  
Overdose 
Based on the experience from the fenfluramine overdose when used in the treatment of obesity at the 
approved daily dose of 60 to 120 mg/day, the relevant information is included in section 4.9 of the SmPC.  
De novo adult cohort 
7 adult patients aged 18-19 years at the time of their first dose were included in the phase 3 studies. The 
amount of safety data in these 7 patients is too limited to draw any conclusions regarding the safety of 
fenfluramine in fenfluramine naïve adults. During the assessment, 28 patients aged >18 to ≤35 years were 
included in a De Novo Cohort and the safety data was presented. No difference in AE pattern from the 
paediatric population was observed in these limited adult data.  
From the safety database, all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In conclusion, the safety data presented is sufficient to allow a benefit-risk assessment in the paediatric 
population in the DS indication.  
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
In view of the recognised important potential risk of VHD and PAH and the remaining uncertainties regarding 
long-term cardiovascular risk, the CHMP agrees that an imposed category 1 registry PASS, with a focus on 
characterising and quantifying the important potential risks VHD and PAH, is required. In addition, data 
regarding growth retardation will be collected in the imposed PASS. 
As the benefit-risk from potential off-label use in weight management with higher doses is known to be 
negative, a controlled access programme (CAP) is to be implemented in order to prevent off-label use and to 
ensure regular cardiac monitoring.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 25.06.2020. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Fintepla (fenfluramine) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it has an imposed PASS registry to further characterise the long-term safety of 
fenfluramine regarding the important potential risks of VHD and PAH and growth retardation. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Dravet syndrome (DS) has an incidence of approximately 1:20,000 births. The prevalence estimates are 
uncertain, possibly around 3/100,000. DS is believed to account for approximately 7% of all severe epilepsies 
starting before the age of 3 years. The syndrome, also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, is 
characterised by a variety of seizures (febrile and afebrile, generalized and unilateral, clonic or tonic–clonic) 
that occur in the first year of life. Onset usually between 4 and 8 months of age often triggered by fever. 
Significant developmental delay becomes apparent from the second year onwards and associated 
neuropsychological disturbances, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, are common. Intellectual 
impairment affects nearly all patients and is severe in 50% of cases. Between 70% and 80% of patients carry 
sodium channel α1 subunit gene (SCN1A) abnormalities. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Only stiripentol (STP, Diacomit) and cannabidiol (Epidyolex), when taken in conjunction with sodium 
valproate (VPA) or clobazam (CLB), are currently approved in Europe for the treatment of DS. Neither VPA 
nor CLB are approved for DS specifically, but both are approved for use in epilepsy in the EU, and widely 
used. VPA is often used to prevent the initial recurrence of convulsive seizures, and benzodiazepines (e.g., 
diazepam, midazolam, clonazepam, or CLB) are frequently co-administered to limit the duration of long-
lasting seizures. Second line and later options in DS typically include STP, topiramate, ketogenic diet, 
levetiracetam (LEV), bromides, and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Polytherapy is common. Of note, patients 
with DS may be prone to seizure exacerbation with sodium channel modulators such as carbamazepine, 
oxcarbazepine, LTG, phenytoin, and vigabatrin. 
Sufficient seizure control may be difficult to achieve, and thus there is a need for new therapies with a 
different mode of action. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In Study 1, the primary endpoint was met with a mean convulsive seizure frequency (CSF) reduction from 
32.95 to 18.89 in the 0.8 mg/kg/day group as compared to a mean reduction from 46.07 to 40.56 in the 
placebo group. The median percent change in CSF from baseline was -72.4% for the 0.8 mg/kg/day group 
versus -17.4% for placebo. The clinical relevance of the reduction was supported by the 50% responder 
analysis where 72.5% of the patients on 0.8 mg/kg/day achieved a 50% reduction in the maintenance period 
as compared to 10.3% of patients on placebo in this period. 
In Study 1504, the primary endpoint was also met. The mean CSF decreased from 27.90 at baseline to 24.72 
at the end of the T+M period for the 0.5mg/kg/day group compared to 21.62 at baseline to 20.97 for the 
placebo. Patients randomised to Fintepla 0.5 mg/kg/day achieved a 54.9% greater reduction in monthly CSF 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 91/101 
 
  
  
between the Baseline period and the M period than subjects randomised to placebo. The median percent 
change in CSF from baseline was -63.1% for the 0.5 mg/kg/day group versus -1.1% for placebo. The clinical 
relevance of the reduction was supported by the 50% responder analysis where 54.8% of the patients on 0.5 
mg/kg/day achieved a 50% reduction in the maintenance period as compared to 9.1% of patients on placebo 
in this period.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The design of the individual clinical studies 1501, 1502 and 1504 appears adequate, however the pooled 
analysis of studies 1501 and 1502 to form Study 1 was not described in a protocol and a number of study 
conduct breaches were identified. A GCP inspection was subsequently conducted and several violations were 
identified.  
Sensitivity analyses indicated that the efficacy of the 0.2 mg/kg/day dose is not supported by robust clinical 
data. 
The efficacy of fenfluramine in DS has only been investigated in children from 2-18 years old and adult data 
is sparse. As the pattern of seizures may change with age, the CHMP was of the opinion that efficacy data in 
children cannot be easily extrapolated to patients who will start treatment at adult age. However, during the 
oral explanation, the Applicant presented data on seizure type and frequency across age groups from infants 
to adults with Dravet syndrome confirming a high seizure burden and overall comparable distribution of 
seizure types independent of age (Lagae 2018). In addition, limited data from 7 adolescents/young adults 
suggest efficacy in adults. Taking together the similarity of seizure burden and seizure types in adult 
compared to paediatric patients with Dravet syndrome and at least some evidence from the clinical studies 
that fenfluramine also works in adult patients, the CHMP concluded that extrapolation of efficacy is possible. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Nervous system disorders, such as lethargy (14% vs. 5%), somnolence (11% vs. 7%), and status epilepticus 
(7% vs. 2%), and psychiatric disorders, such as ‘abnormal behaviour’ (6% vs. 1%) and ‘irritability’ (4% vs. 
2%) were more frequent in the ZX008 group as compared to the placebo group. These adverse reactions are 
also known for other AEDs.  
Decreased appetite occurred in 37% of subjects in ZX008 groups as compared to 8% of subjects in the 
placebo group. Decreased appetite was ongoing in 60% of all subjects at the end of the double-blind 
treatment period. Decreased weight occurred in 9% in the ZX008 groups and 1% in the placebo group during 
the double-blind studies. Further, reduced blood glucose occurred in 5% in the ZX008 groups and 2% in the 
placebo group. Decreased appetite and weight reductions are also described for other AEDs. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There is very little information regarding the exposure-safety relationship in the current dossier. The provided 
PK information is too limited to allow a full evaluation, in particular in terms of differential pharmacokinetics 
of metabolites and enantiomers.  
Some analyses, conducted with various definitions of the safety variables, in different data sets and with 
frequencies are expressed in different ways, were difficult to assess. However, in several cases it seems 
acceptable to rely on the largest data set (330 patients) from the open-label extension study 1503. 
Assessment report  
EMA/639853/2020 
Page 92/101 
 
  
  
Across the various data sets, the relationship between fenfluramine treatment, concomitant STP and the 
occurrence of seizure/status epilepticus is still unclear.  
Reduced weight is a known risk with this product. Even though the data are currently not conclusive, there 
are also concern about reduced growth. Growth retardation is classified as an important potential risk in the 
RMP.  
With respect to the safety database, the Applicant will perform a long-term registry PASS study to 
complement the rather small safety database from the current program. Focus will be on VHD and PAH, as 
well as growth retardation.  
With respect to the safety database, the Applicant will perform a long-term registry PASS study to 
complement the rather small safety database from the current program. Focus will be on VHD and PAH, as 
well as growth retardation.  
Although data in adult patients are limited, no difference in AE pattern was observed compared to paediatric 
patients.  
Risk minimisation measures are considered adequate to mitigate the uncertainties. 
The known risk of VHD and PAH from the use of fenfluramine as an appetite suppressant is considered a 
potential important risk in the DS indication (maximum doses 2-4 times lower than those used in weight 
management). This potential risk is addressed in the RMP, including the imposed PASS registry study, and in 
the echocardiogram monitoring program. 
Considering that the potential risk for off-label use in weight management with the higher doses may not be 
addressed by these measures and in view of the known negative benefit-risk in such off-label use, the CHMP 
agreed that Fintepla should be prescribed and dispensed according to a controlled access programme.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The reported reductions in seizure frequency and the number of patients achieving a 50% reduction in 
seizure frequency on Fintepla comparing to placebo appear to be clinically relevant. However, the frequency 
of prolonged seizures and status epilepticus is similar or paradoxically slightly worse on Fintepla comparing to 
placebo. 
Data in adult fenfluramine naïve patients are limited but the continued high seizure burden emphasises the 
medical need. Based on published data, the frequency and types of seizures appear to be comparable across 
age groups and, together with evidence of efficacy in a limited number of adult patients and no specific safety 
concerns, it is considered acceptable to extrapolate the results from the primarily paediatric patients in the 
clinical studies to an adult population.   
Regarding the unfavourable effects, Fintepla is associated with number of adverse events, including lethargy, 
somnolence, abnormal behaviour, irritability, decreased appetite and weight loss. These AEs, not uncommon 
for other AEDs and as such are not prohibitive for the use of Fintepla, should however be taken into 
consideration when evaluating the risk benefit. Previous experience with fenfluramine in the treatment of 
obesity in adults has demonstrated that the drug is associated with potentially serious cardiovascular toxicity, 
in particular VHD. While the data presented for Fintepla does not indicate similar problems in DS patients 
exposed to 2-4 fold lower doses, the safety database, in terms of both number of subjects exposed and 
duration of exposure, is too limited to provide reassurance that this concern is not relevant for the DS 
indication. 
Therefore, a rigorous approach to the echocardiogram monitoring and strict decision criteria for stopping the 
treatment as described in the SmPC is pivotal. An imposed PASS is also considered necessary to address 
these safety uncertainties.  
In addition, in order to prevent the off-label use in weight management where the benefit-risk is known to be 
negative, a controlled access programme should be established in each Member State prior to the launch of 
Fintepla. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In paediatric subjects with DS, the effect on seizure frequency is clinically relevant and outweighs the 
unfavourable effect. In adults, data are limited but extrapolation is considered acceptable. The well-known 
risks of the product are adequately handled in SmPC, Annex II and RMP. In addition, Fintepla is to be 
prescribed and dispensed according to a controlled access programme. 
Third party intervention during the evaluation of Fintepla 
During the assessment of Fintepla, on 7 September and 12 September 2020, the CHMP received from the 
Dravet Syndrome European Federation a correspondence and survey analyses regarding the benefit of 
fenfluramine from the perspective of DS patients. On 09.09.2002, the CHMP also received a correspondence 
from the Spanish Fundación Síndrome de Dravet (FSD).  
The correspondences and data highlighted the importance of increased treatment options for the DS patients 
and supported the Marketing Authorisation of Fintepla.

Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Fintepla is positive. 
The divergent position is appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Fintepla is not similar to Epidyolex within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority that the 
benefit-risk balance of Fintepla is favourable in the following indication: 
Fintepla is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome as an add-on therapy to 
other antiepileptic medicines for patients 2 years of age and older.

being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Fintepla in each Member State (MS), the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) must agree 
the content and format of the educational materials (EM) and the controlled access programme (CAP) 
including communication media, distribution modalities and any other aspects of the programme, with the 
National Competent Authorities (NCA).  
The MAH shall ensure that, in each MS where Fintepla is marketed, a CAP is implemented to prevent off-label 
use for weight management in obese patients, since the benefit-risk ratio in this population is known to be 
negative.  
In addition, the CAP shall be implemented to confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the 
need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla due to the potential risk of valvular heart 
disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where Fintepla is marketed, all healthcare professionals who are 
expected to prescribe the product are aware of the CAP and are provided with the educational package 
consisting of: 
•  Summary of product characteristics (SmPC) 
•  HCP guide  
The educational material for healthcare professionals (HCP guide) shall address the following risks: 
•  Valvular heart disease (VHD) 
• 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
•  Off-label use for weight management 
The HCP guide shall contain the following key messages:  
•  Brief information about the historical background on fenfluramine and its market withdrawal due to 
the risks of VHD and PAH. 
• 
Emphasis that the currently approved indication has to be strictly adhered to and access is therefore 
controlled ensuring proper information of physicians before prescribing.

Information about the importance of periodic cardiac monitoring (ECHOs) 
Education about the detection and proper management of VHD and PAH associated with fenfluramine 
Encouragement to participate in the fenfluramine registry to collect long-term safety data. 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
FINTEPLA Registry on long-term safety 
The MAH shall perform an observational registry to provide data on long-term safety 
of fenfluramine in routine practice, with a focus on characterising and quantifying the 
important potential risks VHD and PAH (primary objective), and growth retardation 
(secondary objective). In addition, data on the frequency of echocardiographic 
monitoring will contribute to assess the effectiveness of risk minimisation measures.

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
The Member States should ensure that all conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use 
of the medicinal product described below are implemented: 
Prior to launch of Fintepla, the Member States should agree with the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
the content and format of the educational materials (EM) and the controlled access programme (CAP) 
including communication media, distribution modalities and any other aspects of the programme, with the 
National Competent Authorities (NCA).  
The Member State where Fintepla is marketed should ensure that the MAH has implemented a CAP to 
prevent off-label use for weight management in obese patients, since the benefit-risk ratio in this population 
is known to be negative.  
In addition, the CAP shall be implemented to confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the 
need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla due to the potential risk of valvular heart 
disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 15 October 2020 
Fintepla EMEA/H/C/003933 
The  undersigned  member  of  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  the  CHMP’s  positive  opinion  recommending  the 
granting of the following indication for Fintepla oral solution, 2.2 mg/ml (Fenfluramine hydrochloride) for the 
treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome as an add on therapy to other antiepileptic medicines 
in children aged 2 years and older. The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
In  paediatric  subjects  with  DS,  the  effect  of  Fintepla  on  seizure  frequency  is  clinically  relevant  and  could 
outweighs the unfavourable effects taking into account the proposed CAP measures. However, the initiation of 
treatment  in  adults  is  not  substantiated  by  efficacy  and  safety  data  and  cannot  be  extrapolated  from  the 
paediatric  population  to the  adult  population  taking  into  account  disease  and  patients  characteristics,  which 
evolve from children to adults, and management in adults. As a consequence, since clinical efficacy cannot be 
considered established for the adult population and does not outweigh the risk, the B/R is overall negative in 
the adult population.

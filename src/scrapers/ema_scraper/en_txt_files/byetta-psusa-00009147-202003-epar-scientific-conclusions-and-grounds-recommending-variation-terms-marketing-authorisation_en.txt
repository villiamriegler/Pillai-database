Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for exenatide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on delayed gastric emptying from clinical trials and in view of a plausible 
mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between exenatide and delayed gastric 
emptying is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of 
products containing exenatide should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for exenatide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing exenatide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

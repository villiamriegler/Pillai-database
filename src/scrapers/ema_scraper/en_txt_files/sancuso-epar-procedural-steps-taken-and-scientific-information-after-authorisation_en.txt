SmPC and PL 
Section 4.4 New information added 
the SmPC in order to add ‘Serotonin syndrome’ and 
‘Application site Reactions’ to the list of adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) with frequency unknow; as well as 
‘Application site Irritation’ with frequency 
‘Uncommon’ based on post-marketing data and 
literature. The MAH also proposes to update sections 
4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC to add drug-drug 
Gastrointestinal disorders: “Granisenton may mask a 
progressive ileus and/or gastric distension caused by an 
underlying condition” 
Serotonin syndrome: “There have also been reports of 
possible drug-drug interactions between 
buprenorphine/Opioids and serotonergic medicinal products 
leading to serotonin syndrome” 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

and serotonergic medicinal products based on post-
marketing data and literature.  
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The RMP version 5 has also been submitted. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce 
editorial changes in the SmPC. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
Skin Reactions: “In clinical studies with granisetron 
transdermal patch, application site reactions generally mild 
in intensity were reported and did not lead to 
discontinuation of use. If severe reactions, or a generalised 
skin reaction occur (e.g. allergic rash, including 
erythematous, macular, papular rash or pruritus), the 
transdermal patch must be removed”. 
Potential for drug abuse and dependence “Granisetron has 
no known potential for abuse and dependence” 
Section 4.7 Text replaced: 
“The effect of SANCUSO on the ability to drive or operate 
machinery has not been studied” 
Section 4.8 Text replaced: 
Serotonin syndrome was added as ADR with frequency 
unknown with a description a selected ADR regarding 
reports of serotonin syndrome following concomitant use of 
5 HT3 antagonists with Buprenorphine, opiods SSRIs, 
SNRIs and serotonergic medicinal products. (section 4.5 
also updated) 
Section 5.3 New text added 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful 
effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. These studies 
did not reveal any evidence of impaired fertility or harm to 
the foetus due to granisetron. 
Fertility was unaffected following granisetron treatment in 
rat (sentence transferred from 4.6)

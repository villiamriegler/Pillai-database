CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of opioid dependence within a framework of medical, social and psychological treatment. 
Treatment is intended for use in adults and adolescents aged 16 years or over. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Administration of Buvidal is restricted to healthcare professionals. Treatment should be initiated by 
and remain under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of opioid dependence 
therapies. Appropriate precautions, such as to conduct patient follow-up visits with clinical monitoring 
according to the patient's needs, should be taken when prescribing and dispensing buprenorphine. 
Take-home use or self-administration of the product by patients is not allowed.

Precautions to be taken before initiation of treatment  
To avoid precipitating symptoms of withdrawal, treatment with Buvidal should be started when 
objective and clear signs of mild to moderate withdrawal are evident (see section 4.4). Consideration 
should be given to the types of opioid used (that is long- or short-acting opioid), time since last opioid 
use and the degree of opioid dependence. 
• 
• 
For patients using heroin or short-acting opioids, the initial dose of Buvidal must not be 
administered until at least 6 hours after the patient last used opioids. 
For patients receiving methadone, the methadone dose should be reduced to a maximum of 
30 mg/day before starting treatment with Buvidal which should not be administered until at 
least 24 hours after the patient last received a methadone dose. Buvidal may trigger withdrawal 
symptoms in methadone-dependent patients. 
Posology 
Initiation of treatment in patients not already receiving buprenorphine 
Patients not previously exposed to buprenorphine should receive a sublingual buprenorphine 4 mg 
dose and be observed for an hour before the first administration of weekly Buvidal to confirm 
tolerability to buprenorphine. 
The recommended starting dose of Buvidal is 16 mg, with one or two additional 8 mg doses at least 
1 day apart, to a target dose of 24 mg or 32 mg during the first treatment week. The recommended 
dose for the second treatment week is the total dose administered during the week of initiation.  
Treatment with monthly Buvidal can be started after treatment initiation with weekly Buvidal, in 
accordance with the dose conversion in Table 1 and once patients have been stabilised on weekly 
treatment (four weeks or more, where practical).  
Switching from sublingual buprenorphine products to Buvidal  
Patients treated with sublingual buprenorphine may be switched directly to weekly or monthly 
Buvidal, starting on the day after the last daily buprenorphine sublingual treatment dose in accordance 
with the dosing recommendations in Table 1. Closer monitoring of patients is recommended during 
the dosing period after the switch.

Patients may be switched from sublingual buprenorphine 26-32 mg directly to monthly Buvidal 
160 mg with close monitoring during the dosing period after the switch. 
The dose of buprenorphine in mg can differ between sublingual products, which needs to be taken into 
consideration on a product-by-product basis. The pharmacokinetic properties of Buvidal are described 
in section 5.2. 
Maintenance treatment and dose adjustments 
Buvidal can be administered weekly or monthly. Doses may be increased or decreased and patients 
can be switched between weekly and monthly products according to individual patient’s needs and 
treating physician’s clinical judgement as per recommendations in Table 1. Following switching, 
patients may need closer monitoring. Assessment of long-term treatment is based on 48-week data.

Supplemental dosing 
A maximum of one supplemental Buvidal 8 mg dose may be administered at an unscheduled visit 
between regular weekly and monthly doses, based on individual patient’s temporary needs. 
The maximum dose per week for patients who are on weekly Buvidal treatment is 32 mg with an 
additional 8 mg dose. The maximum dose per month for patients who are on monthly Buvidal 
treatment is 160 mg.  
Missed doses 
To avoid missed doses, the weekly dose may be administered up to 2 days before or after the weekly 
time point, and the monthly dose may be administered up to 1 week before or after the monthly time 
point. 
If a dose is missed, the next dose should be administered as soon as practically possible.  
Termination of treatment 
If Buvidal treatment is discontinued, its prolonged-release characteristics and any withdrawal 
symptoms experienced by the patient must be considered, see section 4.4. If the patient is switched to 
treatment with sublingual buprenorphine, this should be done one week after the last weekly dose or 
one month after the last monthly dose of Buvidal according to the recommendations in Table 1. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
The efficacy and safety of buprenorphine in elderly patients > 65 years have not been established. No 
recommendation on posology can be made. 
In general, recommended dosing for elderly patients with normal renal function is the same as for 
younger adult patients with normal renal function. However, because elderly patients may have 
diminished renal/hepatic function, dose adjustment may be necessary (see below). 
Hepatic impairment 
Buprenorphine should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the use of buprenorphine is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). 
Renal impairment 
Modification of the buprenorphine dose is not required for patients with renal impairment. Caution is 
recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy buprenorphine in children and adolescents below 16 years of age have not 
been established (see section 4.4). No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Buvidal is intended for subcutaneous administration only. It should be injected slowly and completely 
into the subcutaneous tissue of different areas (buttock, thigh, abdomen, or upper arm), provided there 
is enough subcutaneous tissue. Each area can have multiple injection sites. Injection sites should be 
rotated for both weekly and monthly injections. A minimum of 8 weeks should be left before re-
injecting a previously used injection site with the weekly dose. There is no clinical data supporting 
reinjection of the monthly dose into the same site. This is unlikely to be a safety concern. The decision 
to reinject at the same site should also be guided by the attending physicians´ clinical judgement. 
Administered dose should be as a single injection and not divided. The dose must not be administered 
intravascularly (intravenously), intramuscularly or intradermally (into the skin) (see section 4.4). See 
section 6.6 for administration instructions.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
Severe respiratory insufficiency 
Severe hepatic impairment 
Acute alcoholism or delirium tremens 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Administration 
Care must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of Buvidal. The dose must not be administered 
intravascularly (intravenously), intramuscularly or intradermally.  
Intravascular such as intravenous injection would present a risk of serious harm as Buvidal forms a 
solid mass upon contact with body fluids, which potentially could cause blood vessel injury, 
occlusion, or thromboembolic events. 
To minimise the risk of misuse, abuse and diversion, appropriate precautions should be taken when 
prescribing and dispensing buprenorphine. Healthcare professionals should administer Buvidal 
directly to the patient. Take-home use or self-administration of the product by patients is not allowed. 
Any attempts to remove the depot should be monitored throughout treatment. 
Prolonged-release properties 
The prolonged-release properties of the product should be considered during treatment including 
initiation and termination (see section 4.2). In particular, patients with concomitant medicinal products 
and/or co-morbidities, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity, overdose or 
withdrawal caused by increased or decreased levels of buprenorphine (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Respiratory depression 
A number of cases of death due to respiratory depression have been reported for patients being treated 
with buprenorphine, particularly when used in combination with benzodiazepines (see section 4.5) or 
when buprenorphine was not used according to prescribing information. Deaths have also been 
reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other depressants such 
as alcohol, gabapentinoids (such as pregabalin and gabapentin) (see section 4.5) or other opioids.  
Buprenorphine should be used with care in patients with respiratory insufficiency (e.g. chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, 
hypercapnia, pre-existing respiratory depression or kyphoscoliosis). 
Buprenorphine may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children and non-opioid 
dependent persons who accidentally or deliberately use it.  
CNS depression 
Buprenorphine may cause drowsiness particularly when taken together with alcohol or central nervous 
system depressants such as benzodiazepines, tranquilisers, sedatives, gabapentinoids or hypnotics (see 
sections 4.5 and 4.7). 
Dependence 
Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opiate receptor and chronic administration can produce 
opioid dependence.  
Serotonin syndrome 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant administration of Buvidal and other serotonergic agents, such as MAO inhibitors, 
selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) 
or tricyclic antidepressants may result in serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition 
(see section 4.5). If concomitant treatment with other serotonergic agents is clinically warranted, 
careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose 
increases.  
Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes, autonomic instability, 
neuromuscular abnormalities, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. If serotonin syndrome is suspected, a 
dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy should be considered depending on the severity of the 
symptoms. 
Hepatitis and hepatic events 
Baseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status are recommended prior to 
starting therapy. Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, on certain concomitant medicinal 
products (see section 4.5) and/or who have existing liver dysfunction are at greater risk of liver injury. 
Regular monitoring of the liver function is recommended. 
Cases of acute hepatic injury have been reported in opioid-dependent patients both in clinical studies 
and in post-marketing adverse reaction reports with medicinal products containing buprenorphine. The 
spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to 
case reports of cytolytic hepatitis, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic 
encephalopathy and death. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, 
genetic disease, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, anorexia, concomitant 
use of other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products and ongoing injecting drug use may have a 
causative or contributory role. These underlying factors must be taken into consideration before 
prescribing buprenorphine and during treatment. When a hepatic event is suspected, further biological 
and aetiological evaluation is required. Depending on the findings, Buvidal may be discontinued. 
Monitoring beyond the weekly and monthly treatment period may be needed. If treatment is 
continued, hepatic function should be monitored closely. 
Precipitation of opioid withdrawal syndrome 
When initiating treatment with buprenorphine, it is important to be aware of the partial agonist profile 
of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine products have caused precipitated withdrawal symptoms in opioid-
dependent patients when administered before the agonist effects resulting from recent opioid use or 
misuse have subsided. To avoid precipitated withdrawal, induction must be undertaken when objective 
signs and symptoms of mild to moderate withdrawal are evident (see section 4.2).  
Discontinuation of treatment may result in a withdrawal syndrome that may be delayed in onset. 
Hepatic impairment 
Buprenorphine is extensively metabolised in the liver. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose 
caused by increased levels of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine should be used with caution in patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Hepatic function should be monitored 
regularly whilst on treatment. The use of buprenorphine is contraindicated in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Renal impairment 
Metabolites of buprenorphine accumulate in patients with renal failure. Caution is recommended when 
dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
QT prolongation 
Caution should be exercised when co-administering Buvidal with other medicinal products that 
prolong the QT interval and in patients with a history of long QT syndrome or other risk factors for 
QT prolongation. 
Acute pain management 
For management of acute pain during continued use of Buvidal, a combination of use of opioids with 
high mu-opioid receptor affinity (e.g. fentanyl), non-opioid analgesics and regional anaesthesia might 
be necessary. Titration of oral or intravenous short-acting opioid pain medicinal products (immediate-
release morphine, oxycodone or fentanyl) to the desired analgesic effect in patients treated with 
Buvidal might require higher doses. Patients should be monitored during treatment. 
Use in children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy of buprenorphine in children below the age of 16 years have not been 
established (see section 4.2). Due to limited data in adolescents (aged 16 or 17 years), patients in this 
age group should be monitored closely during treatment.  
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnoea (CSA) and sleep-
related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who 
present with CSA, consider decreasing the total opioid dose. 
Class effects 
Opioids may cause orthostatic hypotension. 
Opioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which may cause seizures. Therefore, opioids 
should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, other circumstances 
where cerebrospinal pressure may be increased, or history of seizure. 
Opioids should be used with caution in patients with hypotension, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral 
stenosis. 
Opioid-induced miosis, changes in the level of consciousness or changes in the perception of pain as a 
symptom of disease may interfere with patient evaluation or obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of 
concomitant disease. 
Opioids should be used with caution in patients with myxoedema, hypothyroidism, or adrenal cortical 
insufficiency (e.g. Addison’s disease). 
Opioids have been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, and should be used with caution in 
patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.  
Latex 
No natural rubber or latex is used in the formulation of the needle shield. Nevertheless, the presence of 
negligible traces cannot be excluded and there is therefore a potential risk of allergic reactions in latex-
sensitive individuals which cannot be completely ruled out. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with Buvidal. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Buprenorphine should be used cautiously when co-administered with: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
naltrexone and nalmefene: These are opioid antagonists that can block the pharmacological 
effects of buprenorphine. For opioid-dependent patients currently receiving buprenorphine 
treatment, naltrexone may precipitate a sudden onset of prolonged and intense opioid 
withdrawal symptoms. For patients currently receiving naltrexone treatment, the intended 
therapeutic effects of buprenorphine administration may be blocked by naltrexone. 
alcoholic drinks or medicinal products containing alcohol as alcohol increases the sedative 
effect of buprenorphine (see section 4.7). 
benzodiazepines: This combination may result in death due to respiratory depression of central 
origin. Therefore, dosages must be closely monitored and this combination must be avoided in 
cases where there is a risk of misuse. Patients should be warned that it is extremely dangerous to 
self-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines whilst taking this product, and should also be 
cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with this product only as directed by their 
physician (see section 4.4). 
gabapentinoids: This combination may result in death due to respiratory depression. Therefore, 
dosages must be closely monitored and this combination must be avoided in cases where there 
is a risk of misuse. Patients should be cautioned to use gabapentinoids (such as pregabalin and 
gabapentin) concurrently with this product only as directed by their physician (see section 4.4).  
Serotonergic medicinal products, such as MAO inhibitors, selective serotonin re-uptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or tricyclic 
antidepressants as the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, is 
increased (see section 4.4).  
other central nervous system depressants: Other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, analgesics 
and antitussives); certain antidepressants, sedative H1-receptor antagonists, barbiturates, 
anxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, clonidine and related substances. These 
combinations increase central nervous system depression. The reduced level of alertness can 
make driving and using machinery hazardous (see section 4.7). 
opioid analgesics: Adequate analgesia may be difficult to achieve when administering a full 
opioid agonist in patients receiving buprenorphine. The potential for overdose also exists with a 
full agonist, especially when attempting to overcome buprenorphine partial agonist effects, or 
when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining (see section 4.4) 
Buprenorphine is metabolised to norbuprenorphine primarily by CYP3A4. Interaction with co-
administered inducers or inhibitors have been established in studies using transmucosal and 
transdermal buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is also metabolised to buprenorphine-3β-
glucuronide by UGT1A1. 
• 
CYP3A4 inhibitors may inhibit the metabolism of buprenorphine resulting in increased 
Cmax and AUC of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine. Buvidal avoids first-pass effects 
and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, nelfinavir or indinavir, or 
azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole, or macrolide antibiotics) are 
expected to have less effects on buprenorphine metabolism when co-administered with 
Buvidal as compared to when co-administered with sublingual buprenorphine. When 
switching from sublingual buprenorphine to Buvidal, patients may need to be monitored 
to ensure plasma buprenorphine levels are adequate.  
Patients already on Buvidal who start treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors should be 
treated with weekly Buvidal and be monitored for signs and symptoms of overtreatment. 
Conversely, if a patient who is concomitantly treated with Buvidal and a CYP3A4 
inhibitor stops treatment with the CYP3A4 inhibitor, the patient should be monitored for 
symptoms of withdrawal (see section 4.4). 
CYP3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of buprenorphine resulting in decreased 
buprenorphine levels. Buvidal avoids first-pass effects and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. 
phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin or rifampicin) are expected to have less effects 
on buprenorphine metabolism when co-administered with Buvidal as compared to when 
co-administered with sublingual buprenorphine. When switching from sublingual 
buprenorphine to Buvidal, patients may need to be monitored to ensure plasma 
buprenorphine levels are adequate. Patients already on Buvidal who start treatment with 
CYP3A4 inducers should be treated with weekly Buvidal and be monitored for signs and 
• 
8 
symptoms of withdrawal. Conversely, if a patient who is concomitantly treated with 
Buvidal and a CYP3A4 inducer stops treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer, the patient 
should be monitored for symptoms of overtreatment. 
UGT1A1 inhibitors may affect the systemic exposure of buprenorphine. 
• 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI): Possible exacerbation of the opioids effects, based on 
experience with morphine. 
• 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited data from the use of buprenorphine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Buprenorphine should be used during pregnancy only 
if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. 
Towards the end of pregnancy, buprenorphine may induce respiratory depression in the newborn 
infant even after a short period of administration. Long-term administration during the last three 
months of pregnancy may cause a withdrawal syndrome in the neonate (e.g. hypertonia, neonatal 
tremor, neonatal agitation, myoclonus or convulsions). The syndrome is generally delayed from 
several hours to several days after birth. 
Due to the long half-life of buprenorphine, neonatal monitoring for several days after birth should be 
considered to prevent the risk of respiratory depression or withdrawal syndrome in neonates.  
Breast-feeding 
Buprenorphine and its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk and Buvidal should be used with 
caution during breast-feeding.  
Fertility 
There are no or limited data on effects of buprenorphine on human fertility. 
An effect of buprenorphine on fertility in animals has not been seen (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Buprenorphine has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines when 
administered to opioid-dependent patients. Buprenorphine may cause drowsiness, dizziness or 
impaired thinking, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. If used together with 
alcohol or central nervous system depressants, the effect is likely to be more pronounced (see 
sections 4.4. and 4.5).  
The patient should be cautioned not to drive or operate hazardous machinery whilst taking this 
medicine until it is known how the patient is affected by the medicine. An individual recommendation 
should be given by the treating healthcare professional.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The adverse reactions most frequently reported for buprenorphine are headache, nausea, hyperhidrosis, 
insomnia, drug withdrawal syndrome and pain.

In  the  double-blind,  phase 3  efficacy  trial,  injection  site-related  adverse  reactions  were  observed  in 
36 (16.9%) of the 213 patients (5% of the administered injections) in the Buvidal treatment group. The 
most  common  adverse  reactions  were  injection  site  pain  (8.9%),  injection  site  pruritus  (6.1%)  and 
injection site erythema (4.7%). The injection site reactions were all mild or moderate in severity and 
most events were transient.  
Injection site-related adverse reactions of abscess, ulceration and necrosis have been reported during 
post-marketing use with Buvidal.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medical product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Respiratory depression, as a result of central nervous system depression, is the primary symptom 
requiring intervention in the case of buprenorphine overdose because it may lead to respiratory arrest 
and death. Preliminary symptoms of overdose may also include excessive sweating, somnolence, 
amblyopia, miosis, hypotension, nausea, vomiting and / or speech disorders. 
Treatment 
General supportive measures should be instituted, including close monitoring of respiratory and 
cardiac status of the patient. Symptomatic treatment of respiratory depression, following standard 
intensive care measures, should be instituted. A patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation 
must be assured. The patient should be transferred to an environment within which full resuscitation 
facilities are available. If the patient vomits, precautions must be taken to prevent aspiration. Use of an 
opioid antagonist (i.e. naloxone) is recommended, despite the modest effect it may have in reversing 
the respiratory symptoms of buprenorphine compared with its effects on full agonist opioids. 
The long duration of action of buprenorphine and the prolonged release from Buvidal, should be taken 
into consideration when determining length of treatment needed to reverse the effects of an overdose, 
(see section 4.4). Naloxone can be cleared more rapidly than buprenorphine, allowing for a return of 
previously controlled buprenorphine overdose symptoms.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, drugs used in opioid dependence, 
ATC code: N07BC01 
Mechanism of action 
Buprenorphine is an opioid partial agonist/antagonist which binds to the μ (mu) and κ (kappa) opioid 
receptors of the brain. Its activity in opioid maintenance treatment is attributed to its slowly reversible 
properties with the μ-opioid receptors which, over a prolonged period, might minimise the need of 
illicit opioids for patients with opioid dependence. 
Opioid agonist ceiling effects were observed during clinical pharmacology studies in opioid-dependent 
persons. 
Clinical efficacy  
The efficacy and safety of Buvidal in the treatment of opioid dependence were established in a pivotal 
phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, flexible-dose study in patients 
with moderate to severe opioid dependence. In this study, 428 patients were randomised to one of two 
treatment groups. Patients in the Buvidal group (n = 213) received weekly injections (16 mg to 32 mg) 
during the first 12 weeks followed by monthly injections (64 mg to 160 mg) during the last 12 weeks, 
plus daily doses of sublingual placebo tablets during the complete treatment period. Patients in the 
sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone group (n = 215) received weekly placebo injections during the first 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 weeks and monthly placebo injections during the last 12 weeks, plus daily sublingual 
buprenorphine/naloxone tablets during the complete treatment period (8 mg to 24 mg during the first 
12 weeks and 8 mg to 32 mg during the last 12 weeks). During the 12 weeks with monthly injections, 
patients in both groups could receive one additional 8 mg weekly Buvidal dose per month, if needed. 
Patients attended 12 weekly visits during the first 12 weeks and 6 visits during the last 12 weeks 
(3 scheduled monthly visits and 3 random urine toxicology visits). At each visit, efficacy and safety 
outcome measures were assessed.  
Of the 428 randomised patients, 69.0% (147/213) of the patients in the Buvidal treatment group and 
72.6% (156/215) of the patients in the sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone treatment group completed 
the 24-week treatment period.  
The study met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority in mean percentage of urine samples negative 
for illicit opioids during treatment weeks 1 to 24 for the Buvidal group compared with the sublingual 
buprenorphine/naloxone group (Table 3).  
Superiority of Buvidal versus sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone was met (pre-specified test order) 
for the secondary endpoint cumulative distribution function (CDF) for percentage of opioid-negative 
urine samples during treatment weeks 4 to 24 (Table 3).

b The p-value was for superiority  
A long-term, open-label, phase 3 safety study with flexible dosing of weekly and monthly Buvidal for 
48 weeks was conducted. The study enrolled a total of 227 patients with moderate to severe opioid 
dependence, of which 190 patients were switched from sublingual buprenorphine (with or without 
naloxone), and 37 patients were new to buprenorphine treatment. During the 48-week treatment 
period, patients could be transitioned between weekly and monthly injections with Buvidal and 
between doses (8 mg to 32 mg weekly Buvidal and 64 mg to 160 mg monthly Buvidal) according to 
the physician’s clinical judgement.  
For patients who were switched from sublingual buprenorphine, the percentage of patients with illicit 
opioid-negative urine samples was 78.8% at baseline and 84.0% at the end of the 48-week treatment 
period. For the new-to-treatment patients, the percentage of patients with illicit opioid-negative urine 
samples was 0.0% at baseline and 63.0% at the end of the 48-week treatment period. Overall, 
156 patients (68.7%) completed the 48-week treatment period.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Weekly Buvidal 
Absorption 
After injection, the buprenorphine plasma concentration increases with a median time to maximum 
plasma concentration (tmax) of about 24 hours. Buvidal has complete absolute bioavailability. Steady-
state exposure is reached at the fourth weekly dose.  
Dose-proportional increases in exposure are observed in the dose interval 8 mg to 32 mg. 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution for buprenorphine is approximately 1 900 L. Buprenorphine is 
approximately 96% protein-bound, primarily to alpha and beta globulin.  
Biotransformation and elimination 
Buprenorphine is oxidatively metabolised by 14-N-dealkylation to N-desalkyl-buprenorphine (also 
known as norbuprenorphine) via cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and by glucuroconjungation of the parent 
molecule and the dealkylated metabolite. Norbuprenorphine is a µ-opioid agonist with weak intrinsic 
activity.  
Subcutaneous administration of Buvidal results in significantly lower plasma concentrations of 
norbuprenorphine metabolite compared to administration of sublingual buprenorphine, due to 
avoidance of first-pass metabolism. 
Elimination of buprenorphine from Buvidal is release-rate limited with a terminal half-life ranging 
from 3 to 5 days.  
Buprenorphine is primarily eliminated in the faeces by biliary excretion of the glucuroconjugated 
metabolites (70%), the remainder being eliminated in the urine. Total clearance of buprenorphine is 
approximately 68 L/h. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No pharmacokinetic data in elderly patients (> 65 years) are available. 
Renal impairment 
Renal elimination plays a relatively small role (≈ 30%) in the overall clearance of buprenorphine. No 
dose modification based on renal function is required, but caution is recommended when dosing 
subjects with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
Table 4 summarises the results of a clinical study in which exposure to buprenorphine was determined 
following administration of a buprenorphine/naloxone 2.0/0.5 mg sublingual tablet in healthy subjects 
and in subjects with different degrees of hepatic impairment.

Overall, buprenorphine plasma exposure increased approximately 3-fold in subjects with severely 
impaired hepatic function (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
No pharmacokinetic data in paediatrics (less than 18 years) are available. Simulated buprenorphine 
exposure data in adolescents aged 16 years show lower Cmax and AUC compared to observed values in 
adults for weekly and monthly Buvidal. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Acute toxicity of buprenorphine was determined in mice and rats following oral and parenteral 
(intravenous, intraperitoneal) administration. Undesirable effects were based on the known 
pharmacological activity of buprenorphine. 
Buprenorphine showed low tissue and biochemical toxicities when beagles were dosed subcutaneously 
for one month, rhesus monkeys orally for one month and rats and baboons intramuscularly for 
six months. 
Teratology and reproduction toxicity studies in rats and rabbits by intramuscular administration 
concluded that buprenorphine is not embryotoxic or teratogenic and has no marked effects on weaning 
potential. In rats there were no adverse effects on fertility of general reproductive function. 
Chronic toxicity studies in rat and dog of the vehicle used for Buvidal revealed no special hazard for 
humans.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of opioid dependence within a framework of medical, social and psychological treatment. 
Treatment is intended for use in adults and adolescents aged 16 years or over. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Administration of Buvidal is restricted to healthcare professionals. Treatment should be initiated by 
and remain under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of opioid dependence 
therapies. Appropriate precautions, such as to conduct patient follow-up visits with clinical monitoring 
according to the patient's needs, should be taken when prescribing and dispensing buprenorphine. 
Take-home use or self-administration of the product by patients is not allowed. 
Precautions to be taken before initiation of treatment  
To avoid precipitating symptoms of withdrawal, treatment with Buvidal should be started when 
objective and clear signs of mild to moderate withdrawal are evident (see section 4.4). Consideration 
should be given to the types of opioid used (that is long- or short-acting opioid), time since last opioid 
use and the degree of opioid dependence.

• 
• 
For patients using heroin or short-acting opioids, the initial dose of Buvidal must not be 
administered until at least 6 hours after the patient last used opioids. 
For patients receiving methadone, the methadone dose should be reduced to a maximum of 
30 mg/day before starting treatment with Buvidal which should not be administered until at 
least 24 hours after the patient last received a methadone dose. Buvidal may trigger withdrawal 
symptoms in methadone-dependent patients. 
Posology 
Initiation of treatment in patients not already receiving buprenorphine 
Patients not previously exposed to buprenorphine should receive a sublingual buprenorphine 4 mg 
dose and be observed for an hour before the first administration of weekly Buvidal to confirm 
tolerability to buprenorphine. 
The recommended starting dose of Buvidal is 16 mg, with one or two additional 8 mg doses at least 
1 day apart, to a target dose of 24 mg or 32 mg during the first treatment week. The recommended 
dose for the second treatment week is the total dose administered during the week of initiation.  
Treatment with monthly Buvidal can be started after treatment initiation with weekly Buvidal, in 
accordance with the dose conversion in Table 1 and once patients have been stabilised on weekly 
treatment (four weeks or more, where practical).  
Switching from sublingual buprenorphine products to Buvidal  
Patients treated with sublingual buprenorphine may be switched directly to weekly or monthly 
Buvidal, starting on the day after the last daily buprenorphine sublingual treatment dose in accordance 
with the dosing recommendations in Table 1. Closer monitoring of patients is recommended during 
the dosing period after the switch.

Patients may be switched from sublingual buprenorphine 26-32 mg directly to monthly Buvidal 
160 mg with close monitoring during the dosing period after the switch. 
The dose of buprenorphine in mg can differ between sublingual products, which needs to be taken into 
consideration on a product-by-product basis. The pharmacokinetic properties of Buvidal are described 
in section 5.2. 
Maintenance treatment and dose adjustments 
Buvidal can be administered weekly or monthly. Doses may be increased or decreased and patients 
can be switched between weekly and monthly products according to individual patient’s needs and 
treating physician’s clinical judgement as per recommendations in Table 1. Following switching, 
patients may need closer monitoring. Assessment of long-term treatment is based on 48-week data. 
Supplemental dosing 
A maximum of one supplemental Buvidal 8 mg dose may be administered at an unscheduled visit 
between regular weekly and monthly doses, based on individual patient’s temporary needs. 
The maximum dose per week for patients who are on weekly Buvidal treatment is 32 mg with an 
additional 8 mg dose. The maximum dose per month for patients who are on monthly Buvidal 
treatment is 160 mg.  
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Missed doses 
To avoid missed doses, the weekly dose may be administered up to 2 days before or after the weekly 
time point, and the monthly dose may be administered up to 1 week before or after the monthly time 
point. 
If a dose is missed, the next dose should be administered as soon as practically possible.  
Termination of treatment 
If Buvidal treatment is discontinued, its prolonged-release characteristics and any withdrawal 
symptoms experienced by the patient must be considered, see section 4.4. If the patient is switched to 
treatment with sublingual buprenorphine, this should be done one week after the last weekly dose or 
one month after the last monthly dose of Buvidal according to the recommendations in Table 1. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
The efficacy and safety of buprenorphine in elderly patients > 65 years have not been established. No 
recommendation on posology can be made. 
In general, recommended dosing for elderly patients with normal renal function is the same as for 
younger adult patients with normal renal function. However, because elderly patients may have 
diminished renal/hepatic function, dose adjustment may be necessary (see below). 
Hepatic impairment 
Buprenorphine should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the use of buprenorphine is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). 
Renal impairment 
Modification of the buprenorphine dose is not required for patients with renal impairment. Caution is 
recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy buprenorphine in children and adolescents below 16 years of age have not 
been established (see section 4.4). No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Buvidal is intended for subcutaneous administration only. It should be injected slowly and completely 
into the subcutaneous tissue of different areas (buttock, thigh, abdomen, or upper arm), provided there 
is enough subcutaneous tissue. Each area can have multiple injection sites. Injection sites should be 
rotated for both weekly and monthly injections. A minimum of 8 weeks should be left before re-
injecting a previously used injection site with the weekly dose. There is no clinical data supporting 
reinjection of the monthly dose into the same site. This is unlikely to be a safety concern. The decision 
to reinject at the same site should also be guided by the attending physicians´ clinical judgement. 
Administered dose should be as a single injection and not divided. The dose must not be administered 
intravascularly (intravenously), intramuscularly or intradermally (into the skin) (see section 4.4). See 
section 6.6 for administration instructions. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
Severe respiratory insufficiency 
Severe hepatic impairment 
Acute alcoholism or delirium tremens 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Administration 
Care must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of Buvidal. The dose must not be administered 
intravascularly (intravenously), intramuscularly or intradermally.  
Intravascular such as intravenous injection would present a risk of serious harm as Buvidal forms a 
solid mass upon contact with body fluids, which potentially could cause blood vessel injury, 
occlusion, or thromboembolic events. 
To minimise the risk of misuse, abuse and diversion, appropriate precautions should be taken when 
prescribing and dispensing buprenorphine. Healthcare professionals should administer Buvidal 
directly to the patient. Take-home use or self-administration of the product by patients is not allowed. 
Any attempts to remove the depot should be monitored throughout treatment. 
Prolonged-release properties 
The prolonged-release properties of the product should be considered during treatment including 
initiation and termination (see section 4.2). In particular, patients with concomitant medicinal products 
and/or co-morbidities, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity, overdose or 
withdrawal caused by increased or decreased levels of buprenorphine (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Respiratory depression 
A number of cases of death due to respiratory depression have been reported for patients being treated 
with buprenorphine, particularly when used in combination with benzodiazepines (see section 4.5) or 
when buprenorphine was not used according to prescribing information. Deaths have also been 
reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other depressants such 
as alcohol, gabapentinoids (such as pregabalin and gabapentin) (see section 4.5) or other opioids.  
Buprenorphine should be used with care in patients with respiratory insufficiency (e.g. chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, 
hypercapnia, pre-existing respiratory depression or kyphoscoliosis). 
Buprenorphine may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children and non-opioid 
dependent persons who accidentally or deliberately use it.  
CNS depression 
Buprenorphine may cause drowsiness particularly when taken together with alcohol or central nervous 
system depressants such as benzodiazepines, tranquilisers, sedatives, gabapentinoids or hypnotics (see 
sections 4.5 and 4.7). 
Dependence 
Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opiate receptor and chronic administration can produce 
opioid dependence.  
Serotonin syndrome 
Concomitant administration of Buvidal and other serotonergic agents, such as MAO inhibitors, 
selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) 
or tricyclic antidepressants may result in serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition 
(see section 4.5). If concomitant treatment with other serotonergic agents is clinically warranted, 
careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose 
increases.  
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes, autonomic instability, 
neuromuscular abnormalities, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. If serotonin syndrome is suspected, a 
dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy should be considered depending on the severity of the 
symptoms. 
Hepatitis and hepatic events 
Baseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status are recommended prior to 
starting therapy. Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, on certain concomitant medicinal 
products (see section 4.5) and/or who have existing liver dysfunction are at greater risk of liver injury. 
Regular monitoring of the liver function is recommended. 
Cases of acute hepatic injury have been reported in opioid-dependent patients both in clinical studies 
and in post-marketing adverse reaction reports with medicinal products containing buprenorphine. The 
spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to 
case reports of cytolytic hepatitis, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic 
encephalopathy and death. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, 
genetic disease, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, anorexia, concomitant 
use of other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products and ongoing injecting drug use may have a 
causative or contributory role. These underlying factors must be taken into consideration before 
prescribing buprenorphine and during treatment. When a hepatic event is suspected, further biological 
and aetiological evaluation is required. Depending on the findings, Buvidal may be discontinued. 
Monitoring beyond the weekly and monthly treatment period may be needed. If treatment is 
continued, hepatic function should be monitored closely. 
Precipitation of opioid withdrawal syndrome 
When initiating treatment with buprenorphine, it is important to be aware of the partial agonist profile 
of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine products have caused precipitated withdrawal symptoms in opioid-
dependent patients when administered before the agonist effects resulting from recent opioid use or 
misuse have subsided. To avoid precipitated withdrawal, induction must be undertaken when objective 
signs and symptoms of mild to moderate withdrawal are evident (see section 4.2).  
Discontinuation of treatment may result in a withdrawal syndrome that may be delayed in onset. 
Hepatic impairment 
Buprenorphine is extensively metabolised in the liver. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose 
caused by increased levels of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine should be used with caution in patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Hepatic function should be monitored 
regularly whilst on treatment. The use of buprenorphine is contraindicated in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Renal impairment 
Metabolites of buprenorphine accumulate in patients with renal failure. Caution is recommended when 
dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2). 
QT prolongation 
Caution should be exercised when co-administering Buvidal with other medicinal products that 
prolong the QT interval and in patients with a history of long QT syndrome or other risk factors for 
QT prolongation. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Acute pain management 
For management of acute pain during continued use of Buvidal, a combination of use of opioids with 
high mu-opioid receptor affinity (e.g. fentanyl), non-opioid analgesics and regional anaesthesia might 
be necessary. Titration of oral or intravenous short-acting opioid pain medicinal products (immediate-
release morphine, oxycodone or fentanyl) to the desired analgesic effect in patients treated with 
Buvidal might require higher doses. Patients should be monitored during treatment. 
Use in children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy of buprenorphine in children below the age of 16 years have not been 
established (see section 4.2). Due to limited data in adolescents (aged 16 or 17 years), patients in this 
age group should be monitored closely during treatment. 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnoea (CSA) and sleep-
related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who 
present with CSA, consider decreasing the total opioid dose. 
Class effects 
Opioids may cause orthostatic hypotension. 
Opioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which may cause seizures. Therefore, opioids 
should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, other circumstances 
where cerebrospinal pressure may be increased, or history of seizure. 
Opioids should be used with caution in patients with hypotension, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral 
stenosis. 
Opioid-induced miosis, changes in the level of consciousness or changes in the perception of pain as a 
symptom of disease may interfere with patient evaluation or obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of 
concomitant disease. 
Opioids should be used with caution in patients with myxoedema, hypothyroidism, or adrenal cortical 
insufficiency (e.g. Addison’s disease). 
Opioids have been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, and should be used with caution in 
patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. 
Latex 
No natural rubber or latex is used in the formulation of the needle shield. Nevertheless, the presence of 
negligible traces cannot be excluded and there is therefore a potential risk of allergic reactions in latex-
sensitive individuals which cannot be completely ruled out. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with Buvidal. 
Buprenorphine should be used cautiously when co-administered with: 
• 
naltrexone and nalmefene: These are opioid antagonists that can block the pharmacological 
effects of buprenorphine. For opioid-dependent patients currently receiving buprenorphine 
treatment, naltrexone may precipitate a sudden onset of prolonged and intense opioid 
withdrawal symptoms. For patients currently receiving naltrexone treatment, the intended 
therapeutic effects of buprenorphine administration may be blocked by naltrexone.

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
alcoholic drinks or medicinal products containing alcohol as alcohol increases the sedative 
effect of buprenorphine (see section 4.7). 
benzodiazepines: This combination may result in death due to respiratory depression of central 
origin. Therefore, dosages must be closely monitored and this combination must be avoided in 
cases where there is a risk of misuse. Patients should be warned that it is extremely dangerous to 
self-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines whilst taking this product, and should also be 
cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with this product only as directed by their 
physician (see section 4.4). 
gabapentinoids: This combination may result in death due to respiratory depression. Therefore, 
dosages must be closely monitored and this combination must be avoided in cases where there 
is a risk of misuse. Patients should be cautioned to use gabapentinoids (such as pregabalin and 
gabapentin) concurrently with this product only as directed by their physician (see section 4.4).  
Serotonergic medicinal products, such as MAO inhibitors, selective serotonin re-uptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or tricyclic 
antidepressants as the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, is 
increased (see section 4.4).  
other central nervous system depressants: Other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, analgesics 
and antitussives); certain antidepressants, sedative H1-receptor antagonists, barbiturates, 
anxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, clonidine and related substances. These 
combinations increase central nervous system depression. The reduced level of alertness can 
make driving and using machinery hazardous (see section 4.7). 
opioid analgesics: Adequate analgesia may be difficult to achieve when administering a full 
opioid agonist in patients receiving buprenorphine. The potential for overdose also exists with a 
full agonist, especially when attempting to overcome buprenorphine partial agonist effects, or 
when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining (see section 4.4) 
Buprenorphine is metabolised to norbuprenorphine primarily by CYP3A4. Interaction with co-
administered inducers or inhibitors have been established in studies using transmucosal and 
transdermal buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is also metabolised to buprenorphine-3β-
glucuronide by UGT1A1. 
• 
CYP3A4 inhibitors may inhibit the metabolism of buprenorphine resulting in increased 
Cmax and AUC of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine. Buvidal avoids first-pass effects 
and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, nelfinavir or indinavir, or 
azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole, or macrolide antibiotics) are 
expected to have less effects on buprenorphine metabolism when co-administered with 
Buvidal as compared to when co-administered with sublingual buprenorphine. When 
switching from sublingual buprenorphine to Buvidal, patients may need to be monitored 
to ensure plasma buprenorphine levels are adequate.  
Patients already on Buvidal who start treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors should be 
treated with weekly Buvidal and be monitored for signs and symptoms of overtreatment. 
Conversely, if a patient who is concomitantly treated with Buvidal and a CYP3A4 
inhibitor stops treatment with the CYP3A4 inhibitor, the patient should be monitored for 
symptoms of withdrawal (see section 4.4). 
CYP3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of buprenorphine resulting in decreased 
buprenorphine levels. Buvidal avoids first-pass effects and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. 
phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin or rifampicin) are expected to have less effects 
on buprenorphine metabolism when co-administered with Buvidal as compared to when 
co-administered with sublingual buprenorphine. When switching from sublingual 
buprenorphine to Buvidal, patients may need to be monitored to ensure plasma 
buprenorphine levels are adequate. Patients already on Buvidal who start treatment with 
CYP3A4 inducers should be treated with weekly Buvidal and be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of withdrawal. Conversely, if a patient who is concomitantly treated with 
Buvidal and a CYP3A4 inducer stops treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer, the patient 
should be monitored for symptoms of overtreatment. 
UGT1A1 inhibitors may affect the systemic exposure of buprenorphine. 
• 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI): Possible exacerbation of the opioids effects, based on 
experience with morphine.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited data from the use of buprenorphine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Buprenorphine should be used during pregnancy only 
if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. 
Towards the end of pregnancy, buprenorphine may induce respiratory depression in the newborn 
infant even after a short period of administration. Long-term administration during the last three 
months of pregnancy may cause a withdrawal syndrome in the neonate (e.g. hypertonia, neonatal 
tremor, neonatal agitation, myoclonus or convulsions). The syndrome is generally delayed from 
several hours to several days after birth. 
Due to the long half-life of buprenorphine, neonatal monitoring for several days after birth should be 
considered to prevent the risk of respiratory depression or withdrawal syndrome in neonates.  
Breast-feeding 
Buprenorphine and its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk and Buvidal should be used with 
caution during breast-feeding.  
Fertility 
There are no or limited data on effects of buprenorphine on human fertility. 
An effect of buprenorphine on fertility in animals has not been seen (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Buprenorphine has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines when 
administered to opioid-dependent patients. Buprenorphine may cause drowsiness, dizziness or 
impaired thinking, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. If used together with 
alcohol or central nervous system depressants, the effect is likely to be more pronounced (see 
sections 4.4. and 4.5).  
The patient should be cautioned not to drive or operate hazardous machinery whilst taking this 
medicine until it is known how the patient is affected by the medicine. An individual recommendation 
should be given by the treating healthcare professional.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The adverse reactions most frequently reported for buprenorphine are headache, nausea, hyperhidrosis, 
insomnia, drug withdrawal syndrome and pain.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Injection site reactions 
In  the  double-blind,  phase 3  efficacy  trial,  injection  site-related  adverse  reactions  were  observed  in 
36 (16.9%) of the 213 patients (5% of the administered injections) in the Buvidal treatment group. The 
most  common  adverse  reactions  were  injection  site  pain  (8.9%),  injection  site  pruritus  (6.1%)  and 
injection site erythema (4.7%). The injection site reactions were all mild or moderate in severity and 
most events were transient.  
Injection site-related adverse reactions of abscess, ulceration and necrosis have been reported during 
post-marketing use with Buvidal. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medical product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Respiratory depression, as a result of central nervous system depression, is the primary symptom 
requiring intervention in the case of buprenorphine overdose because it may lead to respiratory arrest 
and death. Preliminary symptoms of overdose may also include excessive sweating, somnolence, 
amblyopia, miosis, hypotension, nausea, vomiting and / or speech disorders. 
Treatment 
General supportive measures should be instituted, including close monitoring of respiratory and 
cardiac status of the patient. Symptomatic treatment of respiratory depression, following standard 
intensive care measures, should be instituted. A patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation 
must be assured. The patient should be transferred to an environment within which full resuscitation 
facilities are available. If the patient vomits, precautions must be taken to prevent aspiration. Use of an 
opioid antagonist (i.e. naloxone) is recommended, despite the modest effect it may have in reversing 
the respiratory symptoms of buprenorphine compared with its effects on full agonist opioids. 
The long duration of action of buprenorphine and the prolonged release from Buvidal, should be taken 
into consideration when determining length of treatment needed to reverse the effects of an overdose, 
(see section 4.4). Naloxone can be cleared more rapidly than buprenorphine, allowing for a return of 
previously controlled buprenorphine overdose symptoms. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, drugs used in opioid dependence, 
ATC code: N07BC01 
Mechanism of action 
Buprenorphine is an opioid partial agonist/antagonist which binds to the μ (mu) and κ (kappa) opioid 
receptors of the brain. Its activity in opioid maintenance treatment is attributed to its slowly reversible 
properties with the μ-opioid receptors which, over a prolonged period, might minimise the need of 
illicit opioids for patients with opioid dependence. 
Opioid agonist ceiling effects were observed during clinical pharmacology studies in opioid-dependent 
persons. 
Clinical efficacy  
The efficacy and safety of Buvidal in the treatment of opioid dependence were established in a pivotal 
phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, flexible-dose study in patients 
with moderate to severe opioid dependence. In this study, 428 patients were randomised to one of two 
treatment groups. Patients in the Buvidal group (n = 213) received weekly injections (16 mg to 32 mg) 
during the first 12 weeks followed by monthly injections (64 mg to 160 mg) during the last 12 weeks, 
plus daily doses of sublingual placebo tablets during the complete treatment period. Patients in the 
sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone group (n = 215) received weekly placebo injections during the first 
12 weeks and monthly placebo injections during the last 12 weeks, plus daily sublingual 
buprenorphine/naloxone tablets during the complete treatment period (8 mg to 24 mg during the first 
12 weeks and 8 mg to 32 mg during the last 12 weeks). During the 12 weeks with monthly injections, 
patients in both groups could receive one additional 8 mg weekly Buvidal dose per month, if needed. 
Patients attended 12 weekly visits during the first 12 weeks and 6 visits during the last 12 weeks 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3 scheduled monthly visits and 3 random urine toxicology visits). At each visit, efficacy and safety 
outcome measures were assessed.  
Of the 428 randomised patients, 69.0% (147/213) of the patients in the Buvidal treatment group and 
72.6% (156/215) of the patients in the sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone treatment group completed 
the 24-week treatment period.  
The study met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority in mean percentage of urine samples negative 
for illicit opioids during treatment weeks 1 to 24 for the Buvidal group compared with the sublingual 
buprenorphine/naloxone group (Table 3).  
Superiority of Buvidal versus sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone was met (pre-specified test order) 
for the secondary endpoint cumulative distribution function (CDF) for percentage of opioid-negative 
urine samples during treatment weeks 4 to 24 (Table 3).

b The p-value was for superiority  
A long-term, open-label, phase 3 safety study with flexible dosing of weekly and monthly Buvidal for 
48 weeks was conducted. The study enrolled a total of 227 patients with moderate to severe opioid 
dependence, of which 190 patients were switched from sublingual buprenorphine (with or without 
naloxone), and 37 patients were new to buprenorphine treatment. During the 48-week treatment 
period, patients could be transitioned between weekly and monthly injections with Buvidal and 
between doses (8 mg to 32 mg weekly Buvidal and 64 mg to 160 mg monthly Buvidal) according to 
the physician’s clinical judgement.  
For patients who were switched from sublingual buprenorphine, the percentage of patients with illicit 
opioid-negative urine samples was 78.8% at baseline and 84.0% at the end of the 48-week treatment 
period. For the new-to-treatment patients, the percentage of patients with illicit opioid-negative urine 
samples was 0.0% at baseline and 63.0% at the end of the 48-week treatment period. Overall, 
156 patients (68.7%) completed the 48-week treatment period. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Monthly Buvidal 
Absorption 
After injection, the buprenorphine plasma concentration increases with a median time to maximum 
plasma concentration (tmax) of 6-10 hours. Buvidal has complete absolute bioavailability. Steady-state 
exposure is reached at the fourth monthly dose.  
Dose-proportional increases in overall exposure are observed in the dose interval 64 mg to 160 mg. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution for buprenorphine is approximately 1 900 L. Buprenorphine is 
approximately 96% protein-bound, primarily to alpha and beta globulin.  
Biotransformation and elimination 
Buprenorphine is oxidatively metabolised by 14-N-dealkylation to N-desalkyl-buprenorphine (also 
known as norbuprenorphine) via cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and by glucuroconjungation of the parent 
molecule and the dealkylated metabolite. Norbuprenorphine is a µ-opioid agonist with weak intrinsic 
activity.  
Subcutaneous administration of Buvidal results in significantly lower plasma concentrations of 
norbuprenorphine metabolite compared to administration of sublingual buprenorphine, due to 
avoidance of first-pass metabolism. 
Elimination of buprenorphine from Buvidal is release-rate limited with a terminal half-life ranging 
from 19 to 25 days.  
Buprenorphine is primarily eliminated in the faeces by biliary excretion of the glucuroconjugated 
metabolites (70%), the remainder being eliminated in the urine. Total clearance of buprenorphine is 
approximately 68 L/h. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No pharmacokinetic data in elderly patients (> 65 years) are available. 
Renal impairment 
Renal elimination plays a relatively small role (≈ 30%) in the overall clearance of buprenorphine. No 
dose modification based on renal function is required, but caution is recommended when dosing 
subjects with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
Table 4 summarises the results of a clinical study in which exposure to buprenorphine was determined 
following administration of a buprenorphine/naloxone 2.0/0.5 mg sublingual tablet in healthy subjects 
and in subjects with different degrees of hepatic impairment.

29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
No pharmacokinetic data in paediatrics (less than 18 years) are available. Simulated buprenorphine 
exposure data in adolescents aged 16 years show lower Cmax and AUC compared to observed values in 
adults for weekly and monthly Buvidal. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Acute toxicity of buprenorphine was determined in mice and rats following oral and parenteral 
(intravenous, intraperitoneal) administration. Undesirable effects were based on the known 
pharmacological activity of buprenorphine. 
Buprenorphine showed low tissue and biochemical toxicities when beagles were dosed subcutaneously 
for one month, rhesus monkeys orally for one month and rats and baboons intramuscularly for 
six months. 
Teratology and reproduction toxicity studies in rats and rabbits by intramuscular administration 
concluded that buprenorphine is not embryotoxic or teratogenic and has no marked effects on weaning 
potential. In rats there were no adverse effects on fertility of general reproductive function. 
Chronic toxicity studies in rat and dog of the vehicle used for Buvidal revealed no special hazard for 
humans.

Important things to be aware of 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Breathing problems: Some people have died from very slow or shallow breathing caused by 
taking buprenorphine with other central nervous system depressants (substances that slow down 
some brain activity) such as benzodiazepines, alcohol or other opioids.  
Drowsiness: This medicine may cause drowsiness especially when used with alcohol or other 
central nervous system depressants (substances that slow down some brain activity) such as 
benzodiazepines, other medicines that reduce anxiety or cause sleepiness, pregabalin or 
gabapentin. 
Dependence: This medicine can cause dependence. 
Liver damage: Liver damage can occur with buprenorphine, especially when it is misused. It 
can also occur because of viral infections (chronic hepatitis C), alcohol abuse, anorexia (eating 
disorder) or use of other medicines which harm your liver. Your doctor may ask you to have 
regular blood tests to check your liver. Tell your doctor if you have any liver problems before 
you start treatment with Buvidal. 
-  Withdrawal symptoms: This medicine can cause withdrawal symptoms if you take it less than 
- 
- 
- 
6 hours after you use a short-acting opioid (e.g. morphine, heroin) or less than 24 hours after 
you use a long-acting opioid such as methadone. 
Blood pressure: This medicine may cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly, causing you to 
feel dizzy if you get up too quickly from sitting or lying down. 
Diagnosis of unrelated medical conditions: This medicine may mask pain and make it 
difficult to diagnose some diseases. Do not forget to tell your doctor that you are being treated 
with this medicine. 
Sleep-related breathing disorders: Buvidal can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as 
sleep apnoea (breathing pauses during sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in 
the blood). The symptoms can include breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to 
shortness of breath, difficulties to maintain sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you 
or another person observe these symptoms, contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be 
considered by your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
Buvidal is not for use in children below 16 years of age. You will be more closely monitored by your 
doctor if you are an adolescent (16-17 years old). 
Other medicines and Buvidal 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Some medicines may increase the side effects of Buvidal and may cause very serious reactions.  
It is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking: 
- 
benzodiazepines (used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders). Taking too much of a 
benzodiazepine together with Buvidal may lead to death because both medicines can cause very 
slow and shallow breathing (respiratory depression). If you need a benzodiazepine, your doctor 
will prescribe the correct dose. 
gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin) (used to treat epilepsy or neuropathic pain). 
Taking too much of a gabapentinoid may lead to death because both medicines can cause very

slow and shallow breathing (respiratory depression). You must use the dose that your doctor has 
prescribed for you. 
alcohol or medicines containing alcohol. Alcohol can worsen the sedative effect of this 
medicine. 
other medicines that may make you feel sleepy which are used to treat illnesses such as 
anxiety, sleeplessness, convulsions (fits) and pain. These medicines when taken together with 
Buvidal can slow down some brain activity and reduce alertness and how well you will drive 
and use machines. 
Examples of medicines that can make you feel sleepy or less alert include: 
• 
other opioids such as methadone, certain painkillers and cough medicines. These 
medicines may also increase the risk of opioid overdose 
antidepressants (used to treat depression) 
sedative antihistamines (used to treat allergic reactions) 
barbiturates (used to cause sleep or sedation) 
certain anxiolytics (used to treat anxiety disorders) 
antipsychotics (used to treat psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia) 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
opioid painkillers. These medicines may not work properly when taken together with Buvidal 
and they may increase the risk of overdose. 
naltrexone and nalmefene (used to treat addiction disorders) as they can stop Buvidal from 
working properly. You should not take them at the same time as this medicine. 
certain antiretrovirals (used to treat HIV infection) such as ritonavir, nelfinavir or indinavir as 
they may increase the effects of this medicine. 
certain antifungal medicines (used to treat fungal infections) such as ketoconazole, 
itraconazole as they may increase the effects of this medicine. 
macrolide antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections) such as clarithromycin and 
erythromycin as they may increase the effects of this medicine. 
certain antiepileptic medicines (used to treat epilepsy) such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine 
and phenytoin as they may decrease the effect of Buvidal. 
rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis). Rifampicin may decrease the effect of Buvidal. 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (used to treat depression) such as phenelzine, isocarboxazid, 
iponiazid and tranylcypromine as they may increase the effects of this medicine. 
anti-depressants such as moclobemide, tranylcypromine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, 
fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, doxepine, or 
trimipramine. These medicines may interact with Buvidal and you may experience symptoms 
such as involuntary, rhythmic contractions of muscles, including the muscles that control 
movement of the eye, agitation, hallucinations, coma, excessive sweating, tremor, exaggeration 
of reflexes, increased muscle tension, body temperature above 38°C. Contact your doctor when 
experiencing such symptoms.  
Buvidal with alcohol 
Do not take alcohol while using Buvidal, (see section 2 warnings and precautions). Taking alcohol 
with this medicine may increase drowsiness and may increase the risk of breathing problems.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may become pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. The risks of using Buvidal in pregnant 
women are not known. Your doctor will help you decide if you should continue taking the medicine 
during pregnancy. 
Using this medicine during late pregnancy may cause drug withdrawal symptoms including breathing 
problems in your new-born baby. This may happen from several hours to several days after birth. 
Check with your doctor before using Buvidal during breastfeeding as this medicine passes into breast 
milk. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Buvidal may make you sleepy and dizzy. This is more likely at the start of treatment and when your 
dose is being changed. These effects can be worse if you drink alcohol or take other sedative 
medicines. Do not drive, use any tools or machines, or perform dangerous activities until you know 
how this medicine affects you. 
Buvidal contains alcohol 
Buvidal 8 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg and 32 mg contain 95.7 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each mL (10% w/w). 
The amount in 1 dose of this medicine is equivalent to less than 2 mL beer or 1 mL wine. 
The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects.  
3. 
How Buvidal is given 
Buvidal must be given by healthcare professionals only.  
Buvidal 8 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg and 32 mg are given weekly. Buvidal 64 mg, 96 mg, 128 mg and 160 mg 
are given monthly. 
Your doctor will determine the best dose for you. During your treatment, the doctor may adjust the 
dose, depending on how well the medicine works. 
Starting treatment 
The first dose of Buvidal will be given to you when you show clear signs of withdrawal.  
If you are dependent on short-acting opioids (e.g. morphine or heroin), the first dose of Buvidal will be 
given to you at least 6 hours after you last used an opioid. 
If you are dependent on long-acting opioids (e.g. methadone), your dose of methadone will be reduced 
to below 30 mg per day before beginning with Buvidal. The first dose of this medicine will be given to 
you at least 24 hours after you last used methadone. 
If you are not already receiving sublingual (under the tongue) buprenorphine (the same active 
substance as in Buvidal), the recommended starting dose is 16 mg, with one or two additional Buvidal 
8 mg doses given at least 1 day apart during the first treatment week. This means a target dose of 
24 mg or 32 mg during the first treatment week. 
If you have not used buprenorphine before you will receive a 4 mg sublingual buprenorphine dose and 
be observed for an hour before the first Buvidal dose. 
Buvidal for monthly treatment can be used, if appropriate for you, once stabilisation has been achieved 
with Buvidal for weekly treatment (four weeks treatment or more, where practical).  
If you are already taking sublingual buprenorphine, you can start receiving Buvidal the day after your 
last treatment. Your doctor will prescribe the correct starting dose of Buvidal for you depending on the 
dose of sublingual buprenorphine you are now taking. 
Continuing treatment and dose adjustment 
During continued treatment with Buvidal, your doctor may decrease or increase your dose according 
to your need. You may be switched from weekly and monthly treatment and from monthly to weekly 
treatment. Your doctor will prescribe the correct dose for you. 
During continued treatment, you might receive one additional Buvidal 8 mg dose between your 
weekly or monthly treatments if your doctor thinks this is appropriate for you. 
The maximum dose per week if you are on weekly Buvidal treatment is 32 mg with an additional 8 mg 
dose. The maximum dose per month if you are on monthly Buvidal treatment is 160 mg.

Route of administration 
Buvidal is given as a single injection under the skin (subcutaneously) in any of the allowed injection 
areas buttock, thigh, abdomen or upper arm. You can receive several injections in the same injection 
area, but the exact injection sites will be different for each weekly and monthly injection for a 
minimum period of 8 weeks. 
If you use more buprenorphine than you should 
If you have received more buprenorphine than you should you need to contact your doctor 
immediately since this can cause very slow and shallow breathing which can lead to death.  
If you use too much buprenorphine, you must immediately seek medical attention as overdose may 
cause serious and life-threatening breathing problems. Symptoms of overdose may include breathing 
more slowly and weakly, feeling more sleepy than normal, feeling sick, vomiting and/or having 
slurred speech or difficulty talking. You may also have smaller pupils. If you start to feel faint, this 
may be a sign of low blood pressure. 
If you miss a dose of Buvidal 
It is very important to keep all your appointments to receive Buvidal. If you miss an appointment, ask 
your doctor when to schedule your next dose. 
If you stop using Buvidal 
Do not stop treatment without checking with the doctor who is treating you. Stopping treatment may 
cause withdrawal symptoms. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor.

Inspect the safety syringe closely: 
• 
Do not use the safety syringe after the expiry date shown on the cardboard box or on the 
syringe label. 
A small air bubble may be seen, which is normal. 
The liquid should be clear. Do not use the safety syringe if the liquid contains particles or 
is cloudy. 
• 
• 
Choose the injection site. Injections should be rotated between sites in the buttock, thigh, 
abdomen, or upper arm (see Figure 3) with a minimum of 8 weeks before re-injecting a 
previously used injection site. Injections on the waistline or within 5 cm of the navel should be 
avoided.

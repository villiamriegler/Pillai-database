2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Pelgraz is indented to be used for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of 
febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the 
exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
The Applicant claims the authorisation for Pelgraz as a similar product to Neulasta (EU) which was 
granted a marketing authorisation in the EU on 22 of August 2002. The proposed indication for CHS-
1701 is the same as for the reference product Neulasta (EU). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and its subsequent infectious complications represent the most 
common dose-limiting toxicity of cancer therapy. Febrile neutropenia, FN, develops in 25% to 40% of 
treatment-naïve patients during common chemotherapy regimens depending on the patient 
population; the dosage, timing and type of chemotherapy used (Dinan 2015). The severity of febrile 
neutropenia depends on the dose intensity of the chemotherapy regimen, the patient’s prior history of 
either radiation therapy or use of cytotoxic treatment, and comorbidities.  
Assessment report

Page 9/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The principal regulator of physiological granulopoiesis human G-CSF is a glycoprotein that has been 
shown to regulate the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow, mediated via a 
single affinity extracellular receptor. By binding and signalling through granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor receptor (G-CSFR), G-CSF has multiple effects on circulating neutrophils and on neutrophil 
precursors in bone marrow (Roberts, 2005).  
Stimulation of precursor cell proliferation in the bone marrow leads to an increase in the total mass of 
G-CSFR-expressing cells, which serves as a negative regulator of G-CSF levels through accelerated 
clearance of G-CSF (Anderlini, 2008). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is a significant dose-limiting toxicity in cancer treatment and a 
major risk factor for infection-related morbidity and mortality. Febrile neutropenia, FN, develops in 
25% to 40% of treatment-naïve patients during common chemotherapy regimens depending on the 
patient population; the dosage, timing and type of chemotherapy used (Dinan 2015). The occurrence 
of febrile neutropenia often necessitates chemotherapy delays or dose reductions. It may also lengthen 
hospital stay; increase monitoring, diagnostic, and treatment costs; and reduce patient quality of life. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Primary prophylaxis with colony-stimulating factors, CSFs, reduces the frequency of chemotherapy 
induced neutropenia, all-cause mortality during chemotherapy, and need for hospital care e.g. in 
breast cancer (Renner 2012, Cochrane Systematic Review). The administration of G-CSF can 
accelerate the development of neutrophils from committed progenitors, thereby reducing the 
incidence, duration, and severity of neutropenia (Dale, 2002). Forms of G-CSF such as filgrastim and 
lenograstim including biosimilars, are administered by a course of daily injections, whereas 
pegfilgrastim allows once-per-cycle administration and may avoid suboptimal daily dosing.   
EORTC 2010 guidelines cover use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, G-CSF, to reduce the 
incidence of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in adult patients with lymphoproliferative 
disorders and solid tumours. Prophylaxis with a CSF is recommended for: 
•  Specified chemotherapy regimens with >20% risk of FN 
•  Specified chemotherapy regimens with 10% to 20% risk of FN, subject to patient specific risk 
factors such as elderly age (≥65 years) and neutrophil count 
• 
Patients with a previous episode of FN  
Pegfilgrastim and filgrastim can accelerate neutrophil recovery, leading to a reduced duration of the 
neutropenic phase in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Filgrastim was initially approved for 
the prevention of infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients with nonmyeloid 
malignancies receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The pivotal study in patients with small cell 
lung carcinoma receiving cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin chemotherapy demonstrated 
an approximately 50% reduction in the incidence of febrile neutropenia and duration of Grade 4 
neutropenia, as well as statistically significant reductions in the incidence of hospitalizations and IV 
antibiotic usage (Crawford, 1991). Subsequent indications for filgrastim included engraftment following 
bone marrow transplantation, mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells and engraftment 
following transplantation, induction or consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, and

severe chronic neutropenia. Because of its relatively short half-life of 3.5 hours, filgrastim is 
administered once daily by SC administration no less than 24 hours after chemotherapy and continuing 
until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery within each cycle of treatment. Shortcomings of 
filgrastim include the requirement for either daily visits to the clinic or home injections by the patient 
during the period of administration, frequent ANC monitoring, the possibility of missed doses, and 
suboptimal duration of treatment (either too short or too long). Efforts to overcome these limitations 
led to the PEGylation of the G-CSF protein. The subsequent PEGylation of the G-CSF protein filgrastim 
altered the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, resulting in slower clearance and a prolonged half-life 
(between 15 and 80 hours), thus permitting a single injection per cycle of chemotherapy (Foley, 
2009). Pegylation of filgrastim increases the size of filgrastim so that it becomes too large for renal 
clearance. Due to its high molecular weight, pegfilgrastim exhibits limited transport into the blood 
capillaries after SC administration and enters the systemic circulation via an indirect route, through the 
lymphatics. 
With a long half-life and target-mediated clearance, pegfilgrastim remains in the circulation until the 
bone marrow neutrophil precursors start to come back after chemotherapy. Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) 
was first authorized for marketing in the EU and US in 2002. 
About the product 
Pelgraz has been developed as a proposed biosimilar medicinal product to the reference product 
Neulasta licensed by Amgen Inc. in different jurisdictions including EU, Canada and the USA. 
Pelgraz (pegfilgrastim) belongs to the family of medications known as Granulocyte Colony Stimulating 
Factors (G-CSF). It is derived from recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor (rHu-met-G-CSF), a 175 amino acid protein, by conjugating methoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG)-
propionaldehyde (20 kDa) to the N-terminal methionine residue of G-CSF. Pegfilgrastim acts on 
hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors, thereby stimulating proliferation, 
differentiation, commitment, and end cell functional activation.   
The indications claimed are as for the reference product (Neulasta): 
Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients 
treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia 
and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
As part of the global development program, Pelgraz has been developed as a proposed biosimilar to 
both the EU-approved and US-licensed Neulasta. Consistent with relevant guidances which were 
current at the time of product development, as follows:

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection containing 6 mg of pegfilgrastim (INN) as 
active substance. Other ingredients are: sodium acetate, sorbitol (E420), polysorbate 20 and water for 
injections. The product is available in a pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with a permanently attached 
stainless steel injection needle, with a needle safety guard and one alcohol swab.  
Pelgraz has been developed as a biosimilar medicinal product to the reference product Neulasta. 
Multivariate analysis has been used to determine the proven acceptance ranges (PARs) for the 
manufacturing steps but no design space has been claimed. The name Pelgraz AS is used to describe 
the active substance (AS) in this application.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Pelgraz active substance is an N-terminally pegylated form of the recombinant human granulocyte 
colony stimulating factor or filgrastim (rHu-met-G-CSF) expressed in E. coli.  
Filgrastim has an α-helical structure with two intra-molecular disulfide bonds formed between cysteine 
residues at amino acids Cys37 – Cys43 and Cys65 – Cys75, with a single free cysteine at position 18. 
The disulfide bonds form loop-like structures that maintain the biologically active conformation of the 
protein.  rHu-met-G-CSF  is  a  protein  of  175  amino  acids  which  is  identical  to  natural  human  G-CSF 
except  for  the  presence  of  an  additional  methionine  at  the  N-terminal  end  and  the  absence  of 
glycosylation.  
Pelgraz AS is formed from rHu-met-G-CSF by the covalent attachment of one linear PEG (polyethylene 
glycol)  molecule  with  an  approximate  molecular  weight  of  20  kDa  to  the  N-terminus  (terminal 
methionine)  by  a  secondary  amine  linkage.  The  structural  properties  of  filgrastim  with  respect  to  its 
amino  acid  sequence,  secondary  structure  etc.  remains  largely  unaltered  in  mono-pegylated  Pelgraz 
AS.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd (IPL). Biopharma Division, Plot no: 423/P/A, Sarkhej Bavla Highway, Village 
Moraiya,  Taluka  Sanand,  Ahmedabad,  Gujarat,  382213,  India  is  responsible  for  AS  manufacture  and 
release,  including  cell  bank  production,  testing  and  storage.  An  additional  site  of  master  cell  bank 
(MCB) storage has been specified.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Cells from one vial of the working cell bank (WCB) are expanded in the seed media to prepare the 
culture which is used to inoculate the fermenter. Post fermentation the cells are lysed and inclusion 
bodies (IB) are prepared.  
During downstream manufacturing, IBs are solubilised, refolded and processed through multiple 
chromatographic and filtration steps to purify filgrastim critical intermediate. The product stream is 
diluted to the desired concentration and 0.2 micron filter-sterilised into a USP Type I glass bottle. 
Filgrastim critical intermediate (CI) is subjected to a pegylation reaction with a 20 kDa monomethoxy 
polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde (mPEGPAL).  The pegylation reaction mixture after filtration is 
further purified through chromatographic steps to result in purified active substance (AS). The 
expected quantity of AS per batch has been defined. 
The process is adequately described with the operating parameters (OP) - input variables and 
performance parameters (PP) - output variables, for each process step. Operating and performance 
parameters are suitably defined with their acceptance criteria. Sampling for in-process testing is 
sufficiently described. There have been questions during the procedure regarding the control of 
bioburden/endotoxin and the control strategy is now considered acceptable to avoid microbial 
contamination. However the applicant should review acceptance criteria/ action limits after the 
production of a specified number of additional commercial batches (recommendation). No reprocessing 
is applied during any stage of the AS manufacture.  
The components of the container closure system for AS are described. The integrity of this container is 
established based on the results of a container closure integrity test and from AS stability data. A 
suitable leachables and extractables risk assessment was performed. The three components of the 
container closure system fulfil the requirements for these types of materials.  
Control of materials 
Compendial  raw  materials  are  tested  in  accordance  with  the  specified  pharmacopoeial  monographs. 
Raw  materials  are  categorised  as  critical  or  non-critical.  All  critical  materials  are  compendial  with  the 
exception of one of the media components used for fermentation. All incoming materials are subjected 
to  review  by  quality  assurance  prior  to  release  for  use.  Vendor  information  for  resins,  filters,  and 
containers used is provided.  
Raw  materials  of  biological  origin  that  are  used  in  cell  bank  and  filgrastim  intermediate  material  are 
discussed. See adventitious agents safety for discussion on TSE risk.   
The  filgrastim  critical  intermediate  is  produced  from  a  G-CSF  producing  clone.  The  cDNA  was 
synthesised  based  on  human  mRNA  coding  for  G-CSF.  During  cloning  and  optimisation  laboratory 
experiments, the pET11a expression vector and E.  coli DH5α strain were used. E. coli BL21 DE3 host 
cells were transfected using a heat shock method and kanamycin was used as a selection agent. 
A two-tiered cell bank system was prepared comprising the master cell bank (MCB) and a working cell 
bank (WCB) in line with ICH Q5D. Cell banks are stored at -80°C. MCBs and WCBs are characterised to 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018

ensure  identity,  purity,  viability  and  stability  of  the  cell  bank  for  its  intended  use.  Periodic  testing  is 
done  for  the  MCB  and  the  WCB  to  check  suitability  of  cell  bank  for  commercial  manufacturing. 
Characterisation  results  for  each  of  the  produced  cell  banks  are  provided.  The  panel  of  tested 
parameters  is  adequate  and  observed  results  are  within  specifications.  Also  end  of  production  cells 
(EOPCs) have been tested and genetic stability was confirmed for cells at the limit of in vitro cell age. A 
protocol for establishment of new working cell banks has been provided.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The AS manufacturing process performance and product quality control strategy includes: controls on 
material  attributes,  controls  on  the  design  of  the  manufacturing  process,  in-process  controls, 
key/critical  process  parameters  (inputs),  performance  parameters:  key  performance  parameters 
(KPPs)  and  critical  performance  parameters  (CPPs)  (outputs)  and  controls  on  the  AS.  All  unit 
operations  in  the  filgrastim  intermediate  manufacturing  process  and  the  Pelgraz  AS  manufacturing 
process are considered to be critical steps.  
A  Failure  Modes  and  Effects  Analysis  (FMEA)  risk  assessment  was  performed  for  the  manufacturing 
process  to  identify  any  parameter  that  could  impact  product  quality  or  process  failure.  Process 
parameters were classified from there. The in-process manufacturing controls (critical and key process 
parameters) are summarised for each unit operation. The control strategy designed by the applicant is 
considered adequate (See AS manufacturing process also for bioburden/endotoxin control). 
Filgrastim is considered a critical intermediate and the information about its manufacture provided is 
acceptable.  
The structural and functional characteristics of filgrastim have been investigated using a wide variety of 
analytical tools, including N-terminal sequencing, SDS-PAGE, Isoelectric Focusing (IEF), Western Blot, 
peptide mapping, mass spectrometry, and biological activity. A number of state-of-the-art techniques 
have  been  used  to  assess  higher-order  structure,  including  circular  dichroism  (CD),  FTIR  (fourier 
transformed  infrared  spectroscopy),  analytical  ultracentrifugation  (AUC)  and  thermal  stability  by 
differential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC).  In  addition,  the  biological  activity  was  assessed  using  two 
orthogonal  procedures:  an  in  vitro  cell  proliferation  assay  and  a  receptor  binding  assay.  Five  main 
impurities were identified by RP-HPLC and SE-HPLC  during development of the filgrastim CI (oxidised 
forms 1 and 2, deamidated forms, dimers and aggregates). Filgrastim quality is suitably controlled via 
the specifications (release and stability). Appropriate tests for identity, purity, content and potency are 
included.  Analytical  procedures  have  been  validated  according  to  ICH  guidelines  or  the  relevant 
compendial  references  and  have  been  demonstrated  to  be  suitable  for  their  intended  use.  Batch 
analysis and stability data of filgrastim CI are acceptable. None of the identified impurities in filgrastim 
CI  has been observed to increase over the shelf life of filgrastim CI.  The proposed storage condition 
for the filgrastim CI when stored in specified containers has been defined.   
Activated PEG that is used for pegylation of filgrastim was originally presented as a starting material by 
the  applicant.  However,  this  approach  was  considered  unacceptable  during  the  procedure  (major 
objection)  and  it  was  re-classified  as  a  critical  intermediate.  The  activated  PEG  (mPEG-PAL)  is 
manufactured  under  GMP  conditions  in  compliance with  ICH  Q7.  The  starting  material  is  proposed  as 
mPEG-OH.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been  elaborated  in  sufficient  detail.  The  commercial  scale 
and storage containers have been defined.  
Data on specifications of the activated mPEG and the starting material, analytical methods for control 
of  the  starting  material  and  intermediate  and  their  validation,  batch  release  and  stability  data  of 
starting material and intermediate and storage conditions (-20°C ± 5°C) have been provided. The re-
test  period  for  mPEG-PAL  has  been  defined.  The  activated  PEG  is  released  as  per  the  accepted 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 14/128 
 
 
 
 
 
specifications  (release  and  stability),  by  SunBio  (the  mPEG-PAL  manufacturer).  The  specifications 
include tests for identification, molecular weight, polydispersity, purity and impurities including volatile 
organic compounds and heavy metals. 
Process validation 
Appropriate process validation studies were performed during the development of the filgrastim CI 
manufacturing process to provide an understanding of the process and unit step operations and 
establishment of a control strategy.  
For the manufacture of the Pelgraz AS from filgrastim CI, studies were performed for the establishment 
of normal operating ranges (NOR) for all parameters and multivariate analysis was used to determine 
the PARs for all parameters that could potentially affect product quality, which were evaluated in a risk 
assessment. The process performance qualification consists of three steps: process design, process 
validation and ongoing process verification.  
Process design: Using process knowledge a strategy for process control was designed. A risk 
assessment by Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was then conducted which facilitated process 
characterisation studies. 
Process validation for the pegylated AS was performed at the intended commercial scale at IPL and 
was designed to achieve initial qualification of the routine production process. The results indicate that 
all unit operations performed during manufacturing are qualified to ensure consistent quality of the 
product produced.  
As part of ongoing process verification, additional validation studies were conducted post PPQ e.g. 
validation to support the inclusion of a bioburden reduction filtration step. Process validation studies 
comprised suitable evaluation of manufacturing component compatibility and the risk of leachables and 
extractables. The ability of the manufacturing process to control process related impurities, bioburden 
and endotoxin were determined. 
Studies have been conducted to demonstrate that specified process intermediates and process 
solutions do not have significant changes in the desired quality attributes over an extended hold period 
and do not have any adverse impact on the performance of subsequent process steps and final product 
quality.  
Appropriate resin reusability studies have been carried out at the proposed commercial scale. The 
applicant indicates that on-going validation will be performed to ensure acceptability of 
resin/membrane lifetime, cleaning/regeneration procedures and sanitisation and storage procedures. 
No shipping validation was considered necessary since the Pelgraz AS and finished product (FP) are 
manufactured at the same site. 
Manufacturing process development 
The Pelgraz AS manufacturing process development has encompassed changes in both scale and 
process at the manufacturing site. The commercial product manufacturing process was developed in 
parallel with clinical development programme. Several changes have been introduced during the 
development of the manufacturing process. Analytical comparability of AS obtained from different 
processes has been demonstrated. The details of the batches manufactured to date are provided.  
The applicant has conducted multivariate analysis to determine the PARs for each of the manufacturing 
steps and confirmed that no formal design space is claimed.

Characterisation 
The characterisation of Pelgraz AS was performed using various batches of AS/FP and Neulasta. A 
series of orthogonal methods were used to elucidate the structure and other characteristics of the 
product, including: primary structure (N-terminal sequence, amino acid composition, peptide map 
ultra-violet mass spectrometry (UV/MS), pegylation site and linkage, electrospray ionisation mass 
spectrometry (ESI-MS), western blot, SDS-PAGE (non-reduced silver and iodine stain), higher order 
structure (circular dichroism (CD), fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), intrinsic 
fluorescence, free cysteine estimation), purity (size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography 
(SE-HPLC), analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), size exclusion chromatography - multi-angle laser light 
scattering (SEC-MALS), reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), cation 
exchange chromatography HPLC (CEx-HPLC), and biological activity (in vitro biological activity, 
receptor binding assay). 
The primary structure analysis revealed that the correct amino acids are present in the correct 
sequence and a single PEG molecule is attached to the N-terminal methionine by a secondary amine 
linkage. The higher order structure of the AS was evaluated confirming a three dimensional structure 
similar to the reference product Neulasta, with predominant α-helical content and a free cysteine at 
position 18. The overall size, charge, and hydrophobicity of the molecule was also confirmed. The level 
of impurities in the AS is low. The functional assays used to assess the biological activity of Pelgraz AS 
include an in vitro murine myeloblastic cell line based proliferation assay and a receptor binding assay 
(see AS analytical methods section). 
Product related impurities of Pelgraz AS include those related to the filgrastim CI (formylated-
methionine filgrastim, partially-reduced forms, oxidised forms, norleucine forms, N and C-terminal-
clipped species). Pelgraz AS product related impurities included di-pegylated forms, oxidised forms, 
non-pegylated forms, high molecular weight (HMW) forms (dimers and aggregates) and deamidated 
forms. In general, the level of these impurities in the AS is very low, controlled, and only a (within 
specification) increase is observed during real-time storage of the FP over the 36 month proposed shelf 
life.  
The applicant provides data indicative of the removal of the process-related impurities (see process 
validation section). Regarding host cell protein (HCP) and host cell DNA, they are also controlled during 
production of filgrastim CI, and validation clearance studies were performed. In conclusion, process 
and product related impurities are adequately discussed. All specified impurities have been present in 
product used in trials.  
Specification 
The proposed release specification for Pelgraz AS has been provided with information on the analytical 
methods used for control of AS. This includes general tests, biological activity, identity tests, 
quantitation, tests for purity and impurity and safety tests.  
Shelf-life specifications include the same tests and specifications as for release except certain tests are 
omitted. The proposed AS release and stability specifications were established based on information 
from the entire process history from early development  as well as data generated on US-licensed and 
EU-approved Neulasta. 
In general, the specifications initially proposed had complex acceptance criteria (particularly for the 
chromatographic methods) but, upon request, some were modified. In addition, specifications for 
detection of sodium cyanoborohydride and free PEG content were implemented.  
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 16/128 
 
 
 
 
 
The specification for potency is broader than expected from the batch release results available and the 
applicant was requested to narrow the acceptance criteria or justify. The justification provided for the 
specification has been accepted although a review of the specification, if possible, after the analysis of 
a specified number of additional batches has been requested (recommendation). 
The applicant has justified the current specifications with appropriate statistical evaluation during the 
procedure and additionally committed to re-evaluate the specifications for potency and purity when 
more manufacturing experience is reached and commits to submit a variation if changes are 
implemented. 
Analytical methods 
The same methods are used for release, stability and in-process analysis of AS and suitable 
descriptions have been provided. 
Compendial methods are considered validated and only qualification for their application in the context 
of the AS was performed. Validation data (in line with ICH guidance) for non-compendial analytical 
methods developed in-house and used for release, stability and in-process control are provided. 
Overall, qualification and validation data provided are deemed acceptable. 
The functional assays used to assess the biological activity of Pelgraz AS include an in vitro cell based 
proliferation assay and a receptor binding assay. 
- 
In vitro cell based proliferation assay: The potency was determined by an in-house procedure 
similar to the specific activity procedure from the filgrastim concentrated solution (2206) 
monograph in the current edition of the Ph.Eur. The method is a cell proliferation assay. It 
utilises the ability of a murine myeloblastic cell line to proliferate in the presence of pegylated 
filgrastim in a dose dependent manner. The cells are incubated with varying concentrations of 
pegylated filgrastim reference standard and test sample. The dehydrogenase enzyme of viable 
cells reduces an added reagent into a coloured formazan product that is soluble in tissue 
culture medium and can be measured spectrophotometrically. The absorbance value is directly 
proportional to the number of viable cells in the culture and hence, to the concentration of 
pegylated filgrastim applied. Biological activity of test sample is determined by comparing its 
response to that of reference standard. 
- 
 Receptor binding assay: This procedure evaluates the receptor binding of Pelgraz AS to the G-
CSF receptor.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided. The results were within the specifications 
and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  Batch analysis data for an appropriate number 
of AS batches manufactured according to the commercial process and batches made from the previous 
manufacturing process are provided. All batches comply with the specification in place at the time of 
release. 
Reference materials 
The previously used and current reference standards are described. The stability of the used reference 
standards is monitored and shelf-life was provided.  
Two in-house standards have been used for the analysis of Pelgraz AS at different development stages. 
A primary reference standard (PRS) and a secondary reference standard (SRS) which have been used 
to support release and stability testing of the AS and FP. The quality attributes of the PRS and the SRS 
Assessment report

have been evaluated by a comprehensive analytical comparability package that includes release, 
characterisation analysis and stability data. 
The specification for release and characterisation for qualification of new reference standards and the 
plan for testing stability of new reference standards is provided.  Overall the strategy followed for 
determination of suitability of reference standards is considered adequate.  
Stability 
Shelf-life and storage conditions have been specified for the AS.  The stability data arising from 
samples stored at the intended storage, accelerated and stressed conditions have been assessed in 
compliance with ICH Q5C and ICH Q1E to support the proposed shelf-life of the AS (commercial 
process). 
Justification for the shelf life is provided by a stability study with a suitable number of PPQ batches 
which indicate that each attribute remained within its pre-specified acceptance criterion at the 
proposed storage conditions in the commercial container closure system. In addition, stability testing 
was carried out under accelerated storage conditions (25 ± 2 °C) for 6 months and stressed storage 
conditions (40 ± 2 °C) for up to 7 days. There were no significant changes observed for any attribute. 
A photostability assessment was also performed on Pelgraz AS in which samples were exposed to 
conditions per ICH Q1B and satisfactory data was provided in the application recommending its storage 
in a dark place thereby protecting from direct light exposure.  The stability results indicate that the 
active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The FP is comprises 6 mg of Pelgraz AS in an acetate buffered isotonic solution for injection, filled in a 
1 mL glass (Ph.Eur Type I), single-use, pre-filled syringe (PFS) with stainless-steel needle with a 
needle-guard for administration via subcutaneous (s.c.) injection and one alcohol swab (a declaration 
of conformity to the Medical Device Council Directive 93/42/EEC has been provided). The safety device 
has been assessed as suitable for the intended purpose. The container-closure components comply 
with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Container usage is supported by 
results of the performed compatibility, safety (including extractable and leachable) and container-
closure integrity studies.   
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are neither novel excipients used in the finished product formulation nor any 
excipients of human or animal origin. 
The quantitative composition of the FP is shown in Table 1. There is no overage and the PFS is filled 
with a 0.65 mL target fill volume to ensure an extractable volume of 0.6 mL at the time of 
administration.

Note that the SmPC lists sodium acetate as an excipient. Sodium acetate is formed by titrating glacial 
acetic acid with sodium hydroxide (shown in the table above). 
The FP formulation was established based on knowledge of Neulasta’s formulation excipients and 
concentrations. The applicant has presented published information on formulation development from 
Neulasta, including forced degradation studies. The applicant has also performed some formulation 
development studies. The final formulation mimics the one published for Neulasta.  
During its development, the FP underwent one designated process change to the proposed commercial 
process. The current process resulted from changes that occurred in the manufacturing process, 
including changes related to scale up, formulation buffer constituents, filtration of the formulation 
buffer, changes to the filter vendor and filter priming. 
The commercial process was used to manufacture the FP used for clinical trial studies, biosimilarity, 
stability and method validation. Comparability data including process performance parameter data 
show that the commercial process is comparable to the earlier process. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Biopharma Division, Plot no: 423/P/A, Sarkhej Bavla Highway, Village 
Moraiya, Taluka Sanand, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, 382213, India is responsible for FP manufacture. 
Additional sites for FP storage and secondary packaging, and importation into the EU are specified. 
Accord Healthcare Ltd, 319 Pinner Rd, Harrow, UK is specified for EU batch release. 
The FP manufacturing process includes: preparation of filtered formulation buffer; preparation of 
formulation bulk solution; sterile filtration of formulated bulk solution; filling; visual inspection;

labelling; needle safety device and plunger rod fixing and packaging. No reprocessing is claimed by the 
applicant. 
The FP control strategy is based on a planned set of controls, derived from current product and process 
understanding that assures process performance and product quality. The manufacturing process is 
well controlled at all levels. Process parameters (both operating and performance parameters) are well 
defined and their categorisation is considered acceptable. The maximum batch size has been specified.  
A written protocol that specifies the manufacturing conditions, controls, testing, and expected 
outcomes was generated, approved, and executed for the Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) 
component of the Process Validation for the FP. The PPQ was designed to achieve initial qualification of 
the proposed commercial production process using three consecutive FP batches. Other validation 
support studies included: manufacturing component compatibility evaluation, validation of buffer and 
product intermediate hold times, filter validation, media fill simulation, validation of sterilisation 
processes and shipping validation / cold chain validation. For shipping, a qualification master plan has 
been prepared but the performance qualification will only be performed with product shipments under 
the normal supply chain. This is acceptable.  
The FP manufacturing process does not increase or modify any product related degradants. Potential 
contaminants that might be introduced in the FP manufacturing process are microorganisms, bacterial 
endotoxins, and adulterating particles. All of these are controlled by the manufacturing environment 
and filling regime employed and are monitored by testing prior to release of the FP. 
A risk assessment has been conducted to identify the potential sources in the process where elemental 
impurities can be potentially introduced. A risk assessment for elemental impurities in line with ICH 
Q3D guidance was conducted. Overall the risk of exposure to elemental impurities to the patient is 
anticipated to be negligible.  
Product specification  
The proposed release and stability specification for finished product has been provided. The panel of 
tests proposed covers the main characteristics of the product and includes appropriate tests for purity, 
identity and potency. Shelf-life specifications include stability-indicating methods and are the same 
tests and specifications as for release except certain tests are omitted (extractable volume, osmolality, 
peptide-mapping, SDS-PAGE with iodine stain, immunoblotting) and an additional test, i.e. dye ingress 
test, included. In general, the panel of tests originally proposed covered most of the main 
characteristics of the product. However, a specific test to measure impurities of non-protein origin (i.e. 
PEG) was considered critical for the control of FP and was asked to be included, unless appropriately 
justified. A method to test free PEG has now been developed and the validation data presented with 
the day 180 response. The applicant has been recommended to review the specifications with 
additional manufacturing experience and stability (recommendation).   
Regarding acceptance limits, the applicant claims to have set them based on manufacturing 
experience. However, for some tests, the originally proposed limits did not seem to be justified based 
on experience since they did not cover the observed variation reflected by either the 
minimum/maximum values or any statistical approach. Thus, the applicant was requested to refine the 
acceptance limits for a number of tests or further justify the proposals. The applicant used the data 
from all lots employed in biosimilarity studies and the specifications for SDS-PAGE, RP-HPLC, SE-HPLC, 
and CEx-HPLC have been revised accordingly.  
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 20/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Current specifications for protein concentration and potency are justified considering the available 
manufacturing experience. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Aside from the tests for physical 
characteristics, sterility and polysorbate 20, all other tests are used for both AS and FP. 
Batch analysis 
A  suitable  number  of  batches  produced  by  the  current  manufacturing  process  have  been  successfully 
released.  Results  are  well  within  acceptance  criteria  and  confirm  consistency  of  the  manufactured 
material.  
Reference materials 
FP is released against the same reference standards and control materials described for AS. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed FP shelf-life in the proposed container-closure system is 36 months when stored at 5 ± 3 
°C. The stability data arising from samples stored at the intended storage, accelerated and stressed 
storage conditions have been assessed in compliance with ICH Q5C and ICH Q1E and justify the 
proposed shelf-life of the FP using the proposed commercial manufacturing process of up to 36 months 
when stored at 5 ± 3 °C. Supporting data of an appropriate number of lots stored in the proposed 
commercial container, include  
i.  36 months of real time stability of developmental process (as supportive data); reproducibility 
batches,  
ii.  clinical batches and–PPQ batches. 
The results indicate that each attribute remains within its pre-specified acceptance criterion. 
Stability data for FP manufactured using the current commercial manufacturing process at the 
accelerated condition of 25 ± 2 °C for up to 6 months and at the stress condition of 40 ± 2 °C for 
either 7 or 28 days are also provided. Thus, within its shelf-life and for the purpose of ambulatory use, 
it is proposed that Pelgraz may be removed from the refrigerator and stored at room temperature (not 
above 25°C) for one single period of up to 72 hours. After 72 hours the product should be discarded 
(see SmPC).  
Three PPQ batches of FP were included in a photostability study which as for AS, require the FP to be 
protected from light. FP is stored in secondary packaging (blister-packaged and then packaged in a 
carton). The applicant was requested to provide supportive data for the claim in the SmPC “Accidental 
exposure to freezing temperatures for a single period of less than 24 hours does not adversely affect 
the stability of Pelgraz.” and “Excessive shaking may aggregate pegfilgrastim, rendering it biologically 
inactive”. Data to support both statements have been provided.  
The data support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
One specified material of biological origin is used in the production of the filgrastim CI MCB and WCB. 
The manufacture of filgrastim CI utilises three specified raw materials of biological origin. Copies of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 21/128 
 
 
 
 
 
certificates of origin are provided. The manufacture of AS from filgrastim CI does not utilise any 
excipient of biological origin.  
The manufacture of FP utilises one excipient of biological origin, polysorbate 20, which is not animal 
derived. A copy of the statement from supplier confirming polysorbate is manufactured from materials 
of non-animal origin is provided. 
Although few materials of animal origin are used, based on the information provided by the raw 
material suppliers (certificate of analysis), these raw materials have no detectable infectivity with 
regards to BSE (Bovine Serum Encephalopathy) and TSE (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy) 
risk and are therefore regarded as TSE/BSE free. These raw materials also do not pose a viral safety 
risk. 
Biosimilarity 
Studies have been conducted to confirm biosimilarity of Pelgraz to its reference medicinal product, EU-
approved Neulasta. Additionally, these studies are used as bridging studies comparing Pelgraz, EU-
approved Neulasta and US-licensed Neulasta products. US authorised Neulasta was used in the non-
clinical and clinical development programme.  
Initial analytical similarity assessments were performed on AS and FP against Neulasta (EU authorised 
and US authorised) as a part of product characterisation prior to the initiation of the clinical studies; 
Further similarity studies were conducted with the clinical batches that are representative of the 
proposed commercial process. 
Several biosimilarity studies have been conducted to evaluate a variety of attributes of EU-approved 
and US-licensed Neulasta and Pelgraz, including identity (N-terminal sequencing, amino acid 
composition, peptide map analysis, PEG linkage analysis, SDS-PAGE non-reducing (silver and iodine 
stain) and western blot), structural characterisation (extinction coefficient, polydispersity, CD, FTIR, 1D 
and 2D NMR, DSC, fluorescence spectroscopy, free cysteine estimation, disulphide bond analysis, 
LC/ESI-MS, SEC-MALS, HDX, and biophysical analysis), purity and impurity profiles (SE-HPLC, AUC, 
SEC-MALS/FFF-MALS, RP-HPLC and CEx-HPLC), biological activity (in vitro biological activity assay and 
receptor binding assays, flow cytometry and SPR based), particle analysis, pharmaceutical property 
analysis and biosimilarity of the stability profiles.  
Details of the specific lots of Neulasta (from EU and USA) and Pelgraz FP used in the biosimilarity 
studies are provided in the dossier. The age of the lots at the time of use is variable. 
The Pelgraz, EU-approved and US-licensed Neulasta were generally found comparable in terms of 
identity, structural features and biological activity. Regarding the purity and impurity profiles, a higher 
percentage of impurities were observed in Neulasta as compared to the Pelgraz FP, however, the 
nature and type of impurities were similar. The number of batches used for the biosimilarity studies 
was initially very limited and after the assessment of the information provided at the time of the MAA 
submission, a major objection concerning biosimilarity was raised concerning the issues described 
below.  
To address questions concerning the bridge between the reference product (EU-approved Neulasta) to 
the non-EU comparator (US-licensed Neulasta) used in clinical studies and the numbers of batches 
studied, the applicant included additional similarity studies including additional EU-approved Neulasta 
lots and conducted a comprehensive similarity assessment. Furthermore, data have been included 
within these assessments to appropriately establish a scientific bridge between EU-approved Neulasta 
and US-licensed Neulasta. The data evaluation was based on criticality ranking. For the attributes with 
Assessment report

“high” criticality ranking, a high number of lots were used and statistical approaches to demonstrate 
equivalence of Pelgraz and Neulasta were employed. For attributes categorised as “lower/lowest”, 
similarity was established for quantitative attributes by comparison of minimum to maximum range 
observed for the test products and for qualitative attributes based on overlays or profiles. The results 
of all tests demonstrate that Pelgraz is highly similar to EU-approved Neulasta and US-licensed 
Neulasta in all attributes studied. 
Comparative stability studies were performed with Pelgraz FP, EU-approved Neulasta and US-licensed 
Neulasta at accelerated (25 ± 2 °C, up to 6 months) and stressed conditions (40 ± 2 °C, up to 28 
days). Based on results from these studies and trend analysis, it was concluded that the stability 
profiles of Pelgraz and both the US-licensed and EU-approved Neulasta are comparable. 
To address the issue of the suitability of analytical methods, the applicant provided method 
qualification and validation exercises for all analytical methods used in the biosimilarity studies to 
demonstrate the appropriateness for intended use.  
In conclusion, from a quality point of view, Pelgraz is considered similar to Neulasta (EU). In addition, 
the non-EU comparator (Neulasta (US)), used in pivotal preclinical and clinical studies, has been shown 
to be representative of the EU reference medicinal product. Biosimilarity has been demonstrated on an 
adequate number of batches and using a comprehensive panel of analytical methods (see Table 2-5).

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active Substance 
The description of the manufacturing process is adequate and questions raised during the procedure 
have been suitably resolved. Filgrastim is considered a critical intermediate and is the AS of an 
authorised product in the EU. There were questions during the procedure regarding bioburden and 
endotoxin control and although suitable action/acceptance limits have been agreed, the applicant 
should review these with additional manufacturing experience of filgrastim CI and Pelgraz AS 
(recommendation).  
Activated PEG that is used for pegylation of filgrastim was presented as a starting material by the 
applicant. However, re-classification of this material as an intermediate was required and was raised as 
a major objection. In response to this MO, the applicant provided new information and all the issues 
concerning mPEG-PAL have been resolved. 
The ability of the manufacturing process to remove mPEG-PAL and sodium cyanoborohydride has been 
tested in a scale-down-model and was confirmed in PPQ batches. Specification for free PEG has been 
implemented for AS and FP release.  
In general, the specifications proposed had complex acceptance criteria but now the applicant has 
modified some, upon request.  The free PEG content specification will be reviewed when additional 
stability data are available from a specified number of lots (recommendation). 
The specification for potency is broader than expected from the batch release results available and the 
applicant was requested to narrow the acceptance criteria or otherwise justify (See AS specification 
section). The applicant has provided justification to support approval of this limit although has been 
asked to revise and restrict the specification if possible, when data of additional batches are available 
(recommendation).  
Finished Product 
Two manufacturing processes have been used for the FP during development but the changes between 
them were not critical. The applicant was asked to further justify the acceptance criterion proposed for 
free PEG content. This specification should be reviewed when additional data are available (see 
recommendation and also FP specification section for more details). In relation to the FP stability 
studies, several questions were raised. These issues have been satisfactorily resolved. 
Biosimilarity 
A MO was raised on biosimilarity. To address issues concerning the non-EEA comparator and number 
of batches needed in the study, the applicant performed additional biosimilarity studies, with additional 
lots of Pelgraz, EU-approved Neulasta and US-licensed Neulasta and co 
nducted a comprehensive similarity assessment. Data also permitted revision of some FP specifications 
and data supporting adequate qualification/ validation for methods used were submitted. The results of 
all tests demonstrate that Pelgraz is highly similar to EU-approved Neulasta and US-licensed Neulasta 
in all attributes studied and established a scientific bridge of EU-approved Neulasta to US-licensed 
Neulasta. In conclusion, from a quality point of view, Pelgraz is considered similar to Neulasta (EU). In 
addition, the non-EU comparator (Neulasta (US)), used in pivotal preclinical and clinical studies, has 
been shown to be representative of the EU reference medicinal product.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP has recommended three points for investigation as stated in the report. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pelgraz has been evaluated in non-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies in order to show comparability of 
the test and the reference product Neulasta EU and Neulasta US. Biological potency was evaluated in 
proliferative biological assay and receptor affinity in 2 receptor binding assays (flow cytometry and 
surface plasmon resonance).  Apart from the in vitro data, the similarity of both medicinal products 
was evaluated in vivo studies using neutropenic rodent model.   The repeat-dose toxicology with 
toxicokinetics study (Study 410.120.1797), comparative local tolerance study in New Zealand White 
rabbits (Study 410.542.4251), and comparative sensitization study in Guinea Pigs (Study 
410.552.4252), as well as the pharmacology study (Study BIO EF 697) were conducted in accordance 
to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
Biological potency 
A cell proliferation assay that utilises the ability of a murine myeloblastic cell line to proliferate in the 
presence of pegylated filgrastim in a dose dependent manner was used.  
Pelgraz (test product) had the relative potency of 101 ± 5.18 % (average ± SD) to reference standard. 
EU-approved  and  US-licensed  Neulasta  had  similar  values  of  99  ±  5.22  %  and  100  ±  5.50  % 
respectively.  Considering that  the  assay  is  representing  mechanism  of  action and  is  highly  critical  for 
assessment, an equivalence approach i.e. similarity is concluded when the 90 % confidence interval for 
the difference in means between the products is contained within an equivalence acceptance criterion 
of  ±1.5  times  the  standard  deviation  of  the  dataset  for  the  reference  product  lots  tested  (-1.5*σR, 
1.5*σR) was adopted. For the statistical analysis, upper and lower biosimilarity limits are set using the 
EU-approved Neulasta and US –licensed Neulasta as shown in table below.

Therefore,  based  on  these  data  Pelgraz  is  highly  similar  to  EU-approved  Neulasta  and  US-licensed 
Neulasta in terms of in vitro potency. 
Receptor binding assay (Suface Plasmon Resonance) 
Surface  Plasmon  resonance  was  used  as  an  alternative  receptor  binding  assay  to  confirm  the binding 
affinity as well as to probe the receptor kinetics (kon and koff, and binding constant (KD)).  
 For  assessment  of  binding  affinity  to  G-CSFR  using  SPR,  equilibrium  dissociation  constant  (KD)  was 
considered.  The  KD  values  (mean  ±  σ)  for  Pelgraz  ,  EU-approved  Neulasta  and  US-licensed  Neulasta  
are  1.5E-10  ±  5.5E-11  M,  2  .9E-10  ±  7.3E-11  M  and  1.8E-10  ±  6.3E-11  M  respectively.  Based  on 
mean  and  population  standard  deviation  of  Reference  product  Pelgraz  showed  highly  similar  binding 
affinity to Neulasta. 
Receptor binding assay using human granulocytes 
To  access  the  binding  of  Pelgraz  and  reference  product  to  GCSF  receptor  present  on  human 
granulocytes a flow cytometry based method was used. The % relative binding activity values (mean ± 
σ) for Pelgraz, EU-approved Neulasta and US-licensed Neulasta are 101 ± 3.61 %, 98 ± 6.31 % and 
100  ±  3.01  %  respectively.  Based  on  mean  and  population  standard  deviation  of  Reference  product 
Pelgraz showed highly similar binding affinity to Neulasta. 
In vivo studies 
The applicant performed two comparative pharmacodynamic studies using the neutropenic rodent 
model.  
Comparative in vivo Efficacy Study of Pegfilgrastim Drug products following subcutaneous 
administration to neutropenic swiss albino mice, Study BIO-EF 697  
The  study  was  performed  with  products  intended  for  commercial  use.  The  study  was  performed  in 
accordance with OECD principles of GLP. 
Swiss Albino mice were divided into 23 groups (10 animals per group). Two batches of each reference 
product  (Neulasta  EU  and  Neulasta  US)  and  3  batches  of  the  test  product  were  used  in  dosing 
schedule.  Study  contained  untreated  control  (saline,  no  CPA)  and  vehicle  (treated  with  CPA  on  D1) 
control  groups.  Neutropenia  was  induced  by  injecting  CPA  at  the  dose  of  100  mg/kg  BW 
intraperitoneally.  24  hours  after  the  induction  of  neutropenia  the  test  items  (or  vehicle)  were

Repeated dose toxicity study in rats (410.120.1797, GLP) 
Wistar  rats  were  treated  with  Pelgraz  (30,  180,  1100  µg/kg)  or  EU-approved  Neulasta  (30,  1100 
µg/kg). Animals were injected SC once every three days for a period of 28 days (a total of 10 doses). 
A recovery period of 14 days was established.  
The  endpoints  of  this  study  were  mortality,  clinical  signs,  body  weight,  food  consumption, 
haematology, coagulation parameters, clinical chemistry, TK, anti-drug antibodies, serum IgG and IgM, 
urinalysis, ophthalmology, gross pathology, organ weights, histopathology. 
No  treatment-related  mortality  occurred  during  the  study.  Two  animals  died  during  anesthesia  for 
blood sampling.  
Clinical  findings  attributable  to  treatment  included  a  dose-related,  partially  reversible  increase  in  the 
incidence, duration and severity of swelling of the joints of the animal’s legs and/or paws. Associated 
findings were limping, assumption of a relieving posture and lying in a ventral position. The incidence 
and  intensity  of  these  findings  also  increased  in  a  dose-dependent  manner.  In  addition,  piloerection, 
indicative  of  stress,  and  yellow  urogenital  staining,  due  to  impaired  mobility,  increased  in  prevalence 
and  intensity  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  during  the  treatment  period.  The  Pelgraz  and  the  EU-
approved Neulasta treatment groups exhibited these signs in a comparable manner at the low and high 
doses.  At  the  end  of  the  recovery  period  there  was  only  partial  recovery  of  joint  swelling  and 
associated difficulties in mobility. 
Slight to moderate impairment of body weight gain and reduction in food consumption was observed at 
the highest dose, more prominently in males.  
Haematology: treatment with Pelgraz resulted in a marked to severe and dose-dependent increase of 
white blood cells in male and female animals.  
Table 9 Effects on neutrophils (x103/µL; mean ± SD) 
After the first treatment with the test item, mean levels of neutrophils in male animals increased up to 
levels of 6 x103 cells/μl in the low dose group, up to 11 x103 cells/μl in the mid dose group and up to 
17  x103  cells/μl  in  the  high  dose  group  (all  differences  statistically  significant,  p<0.005)  when 
compared to the mean neutrophil levels of the vehicle group (1 x103 cells/μl). In female animals mean 
neutrophil  levels  were  slightly  below  the  mean  neutrophil  levels  of  the  corresponding  levels  of  male 
animals.  When  compared  to  the  treatment  with  the  reference  item  a  similar  increase  in  neutrophil 
Assessment report

levels  was  observed  in  both  genders  (males:  low  dose  group  4  x103  cells/μl,  high  dose  group  18 
x103 cells/μl). Mean levels of monocytes, eosinophils and basophils were also elevated but to a lesser 
extent (up to approximately 10-fold).  
At  the  end  of  the  treatment  period,  mean  white  blood  cell  counts  were  severely  increased.  Mean 
neutrophil  levels  increased  in  both  genders  up  to  8  x103  cells/μl  in  the  low  dose  group,  up  to  25 
x103 cells/μl  in  the  mid  dose  group  and  up  to  79  x103  cells/μl  in  the  high  dose  group  (all  differences 
were statistically significant, p<0.005) when compared to mean neutrophil levels of the vehicle group.  
Mean levels of erythrocytes, haemoglobin and hematocrit were moderately dose-dependent reduced in 
animals at the mid and high dose. Mean reticulocyte counts were increased slightly to moderately in a 
dose-dependent  manner  after  both  the  first  dose  and  at  the  end  of  treatment.  At  the  end  of  the 
recovery period, both white and red blood cell levels had returned to normal or near normal levels in 
all treatment groups.  
Clinical chemistry: Dose-dependent moderate to marked elevation of the levels of alkaline phosphatase 
was observed in male and female animals. A partial recovery was observed at the end of the recovery 
period.  Aspartate  aminotransferase  (females)  and  total  bilirubin  (males  and  females)  were  slightly 
elevated, while mean levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase and creatinine 
were reduced in both sexes at the highest dose. All these changes were reversible. 
Organ weights and necropsy: A moderate to severe enlargement in the spleen and a slight decrease in 
thymus weight were observed at the highest dose, these organ weight increase were totally or partially 
reversible.  The  main  macroscopic  treatment-related  findings  at  the  end  of  the  exposure  period  were 
dose-dependent  enlarged spleens,  swollen  joints  and  atrophy  of  the  skeletal  muscle  of  the  hind  legs. 
Swollen joints and muscle atrophy persisted at the end of the recovery period, predominantly in males.  
The histopathology analysis showed treatment-related changes in the liver, spleen, bone marrow and 
hind  paw  (skeletal  system  and  joint).  A  dose-dependent,  exacerbated  pharmacological  effect  of 
pegfilgrastim  was  observed,  with  extramedullary  hematopoiesis  in  the  liver,  increased  granulocytic 
hematopoiesis in the spleen and myeloid hyperplasia in the bone marrow. These findings were partially 
reversible. The bone marrow and the hind paw also showed osteoclasis and osteogenesis at the highest 
dose,  accompanied  by  an  arthrosynovitis  and  myelofibrosis.  The  osteogenesis  and  osteoclasis  in  the 
bone marrow of the sternum mostly resolved during the recovery period but changes in the hind paws 
were not reversible.  
No harmful effects were observed in the injection sites of both the Pelgraz and Neulasta groups.

Table 10 Comparative TK of Pelgraz and Neulasta 
Regarding the terminal elimination half-life, it was shortened after repeated dosing in males at the 
highest dose, whereas the body clearance was increased in all treatment groups. After repeated 
dosing, a markedly increased volume of distribution was calculated in the low and mid dose groups in 
both genders, whereas it was decreased by at least 50% in the high dose groups.

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance testing of Pelgraz vs. EU-approved and US-licensed Neulasta in female New 
Zealand rabbits (410.542.4251, GLP) 
The local tolerance of Pelgraz in comparison to Neulasta was tested in female New Zealand rabbits 
(6/group). The ears (right side) were injected by different routes of administration: subcutaneous 
(clinical route), intravenous, intra-arterial, paravenous or intramuscular with one of the three test 
articles. The Test item Pelgraz caused no adverse local skin reactions after intravenous, subcutaneous, 
intraarterial, paravenous and intramuscular injection.  
Skin sensitization study of Pelgraz in guinea pigs (410.552.4252, GLP) 
The skin sensitisation potential of Pelgraz was tested in Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs in comparison to 
US-licensed and EU-approved Neulasta, using the maximiazation test of Magnusson and Kligman 
(OECD406). 
10 animals per treatment group were used. This study has two parts: Study Part I comprises an intra-
dermal treatment and Study Part II comprises a challenge treatment in the form of topical dermal 
application. All three test products were used at a concentration of 50% for intra-dermal injections, 
formulated in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of Freund’s Adjuvant and physiological saline, and in undiluted state 
for dermal sensitisation treatment. Two weeks following the last induction exposure, a challenge dose 
(undiluted) was administered, by a 24-hour dermal application of the test item. When challenged, none 
of the treatment groups demonstrated visible dermal reactions at the challenge sites.

Excipients 
Pelgraz has been developed for registration in the North American and European markets in single-use 
prefilled syringes available in 6 mg/0.6 ml strength. The quantitative and qualitative formulations of US 
licensed Neulasta and Pelgraz are the same (Neulasta USPI).  In addition, the qualitative formulations 
of EU-approved Neulasta and Pelgraz are the same (Neulasta SmPC).

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted a justification for the lack of ERA. According to the “Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use”, amino acid, peptides and 
proteins are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment and no environmental risk 
assessment is required.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  performed  in  vitro  bioassays  are  in  line  with  the  requirements  stated  in  the  “Guidance  on 
biosimilar  medicinal  products  containing  recombinant  granulocyte-colony  stimulating 
factor” 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005).   
Comparability testing of Pelgraz with the reference product Neulasta included cell binding and 
proliferation studies using a murine myeloblastic cell line. Pelgraz and Neulasta were able to bind to 
the murine cellular G-CSF receptors with apparent similar affinity and efficacy in inducing cellular 
proliferation. The binding ability in terms of the receptor affinity and biological potency is a crucial 
factor for decision on biosimilarity. In this sense, the design of studies evaluating biosimilarity was 
adequate to detect the differences of pharmacological activity. The number of batches used was 
acceptable. Biosimilarity of the to-be-marketed product and reference product (EU approved Neulasta) 
was considered demonstrated on the basis of in vitro data.  
The Applicant submitted two in vivo studies evaluating the effect of test and reference products in the 
neutropenic mice model.  
According  to the  Annex  to  Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology 
derived proteins as active substance - Guidance on similar medicinal products containing recombinant 
granulocyte-colony  stimulating  factor,  the  comparability  of  the  test  and  the  reference  product  should 
be  demonstrated  at  the  receptor  level  in  an  appropriate  in  vitro  cell  based  bioassay  or  receptor- 
binding  assay.  Apart  from  that,  both  non-neutropenic  and  neutropenic  rodent  models  should  be  used 
to  compare  the  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  the  test  and  reference  product.  Two  in  vivo 
pharmacodynamic  studies  using  only  neutropenic  mice  models  were  performed  by  the  Applicant  (see 
below).  Nonetheless,  it is appreciated to  avoid  unnecessary  animal  studies  given  that  in  vitro  studies 
are usually more specific and sensitive to detect differences between the biosimilar and the reference 
product  (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/JEG-3Rs/450091/2012,  EMA/CHMP/BMWP/214262/2015).  In  vivo  data  are 
thus considered as sufficient for comparability exercise. 
The in vivo potency studies conducted on neutropenic mice with Pelgraz, EU-approved and US-licensed 
Neulasta showed similar restoration of neutrophil counts. The relative potency values were within the 
conventional acceptance criterion of 80-125% for biosimilarity.  
In addition, in the repeated-dose toxicity study, neutrophil values were measured in non-neutropenic 
rats treated with Pelgraz and Neulasta. A dose-dependent increase of white blood cells was observed, 
attributable principally to increased neutrophils.  
No secondary pharmacology, safety pharmacology or pharmacodynamic drug interactions were 
conducted by the Applicant.  
There were no nonclinical PK studies conducted with Pelgraz. According to the toxicokinetic data 
obtained in the general toxicity study in rats (410.120.1797), the mean serum exposure to 
pegfilgrastim increased dose-dependently but not linearly in both genders and for both the test item 
and the reference product. The disproportionality of the increases in Cmax and AUClast with dose could 
be caused by the saturation of the receptor-mediated clearance.  
Although some differences were found between AUC and Cmax values for Pelgraz and Neulasta, this 
could be explained by the high inter-individual variability of these parameters and the low number of 
animals. 
The toxic effects caused by Pelgraz or EU-approved Neulasta in rats were consistent with the known 
pharmacodynamic effects of pegfilgrastim, with an expected increase in neutrophil counts accompanied 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 36/128 
 
 
 
 
 
by an increase in myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, an increase in alkaline phosphatase, spleen 
weight and hematopoiesis in liver and spleen. All these effects were dose-dependent and were 
observed for both Pelgraz and EU-approved Neulasta to the same extent.  
Only a slight difference between Pelgraz and Neulasta was observed in the increase in prothrombin 
time, with partial recovery at the end of the treatment-free period in the EU-approved Neulasta group 
and total recovery in the Pelgraz group. This slight difference does not seem of any relevance for the 
safety of the product. 
In addition, during evaluation of anti-drug antibody response indices for a mild induction of antidrug 
antibodies in the high dose of EU-approved Neulasta were found. However, the grade of the signal 
detected during ELISA measurement and number of animals impaired in relation to the number of 
animals tested does not allow consideration of an immunological difference of Pelgraz when compared 
to Neulasta. 
Overall, no considerable differences were found between Pelgraz and EU-approved Neulasta regarding 
the parameters evaluated in this general toxicity study. Both items showed comparable effects. 
Regarding toxicokinetics, the mean serum exposure to pegfilgrastim increased dose-dependently but 
not linearly in both genders and for both the test item and the reference product. The 
disproportionality of the increases in Cmax and AUClast with dose could be caused by the saturation of 
the receptor-mediated clearance.  
Although some differences were found between AUC and Cmax values for Pelgraz and Neulasta, this 
could be explained by the high inter-individual variability of these parameters and the low number of 
animals.  
Genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies were not conducted, as they are not 
required for biosimilar products. 
Local tolerance studies showed that a single intravenous, subcutaneous, intraarterial, intramuscular 
and paravenous injection of 0.25 ml (p.v.) or 0.5 ml (all other routes) of Pelgraz is well tolerated in 
rabbits and comparable in local irritation potential to Neulasta. 
In a skin sensitization study in guinea pigs, challenge with Pelgraz evoked no positive responses in the 
test animals sensitised previously. According to the net percentage value of positively response in 
animals and to the net score value of the skin reactions, Pelgraz was classified as a non-sensitiser. No 
sensitisation potential difference was found between Pelgraz and Neulasta. Pelgraz is being developed 
as biosimilar product of Neulasta; therefore its approval should not cause in increase of risk to the 
environment and in addition, according to Neulasta EPAR, pegfilgrastim is unlikely to be of 
environmental concern. 
No ERA studies were provided with reference to the guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Corr 2). Conjugated PEG component is 
commonly  used,  considered  safe  and  represents  no  additional  environmental  risk.  Regarding  the  fact 
that  the  active  substance  pegfilgrastim  is  a  polypeptide  which  is  expected  to  be  largely  metabolised 
after  administration  and  easily  biodegraded  in  the  environment,  the  omission  of  ERA  studies  indeed 
can be accepted as described in above mentioned guideline. A biosimilar, pegfilgrastim is already used 
in  existing  marketed  products  and  no  significant  increase  in  environmental  exposure  is  anticipated. 
Therefore, pegfilgrastim is not expected to raise a risk to the environment.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The biosimilarity of Pelgraz to Neulasta in terms of non-clinical data has been shown.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Pelgraz development program utilized a step-wise approach and included an analytical similarity 
exercise for Pelgraz with both EU-approved and US-licensed Neulasta to demonstrate similarity in the 
quality attributes of the proposed biosimilar and the reference biologic drug Neulasta, sourced from the 
two markets in order to generate data that supports the establishment of a scientific bridge between 
the two reference products.  
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Absorption  
• 
Bioavailability 
No bioavailability study has been performed with pegfilgrastim.  
On the basis of the studies with Neulasta, the absolute bioavailability of pegfilgrastim is estimated to 
be in the range of 20-50%. After SC administration, Cmax and AUC values were approximately 3% and 
4%  respectively  of  the  values  obtained  after  IV  administration.  Pegfilgrastim  exhibited  first-order, 
delayed  absorption  with  a  mean  absorption  time  of  1.84  days.  The  bioavailability  of  pegfilgrastim 
relative  to the  30-μg/kg  dose  after  subcutaneous  administration  was  approximately  94%, 101%,  and 
80%  for  the  60-,  100-,  and  300-μg/kg  doses,  respectively.  The  lymphatic  system  becomes  an 
important  absorption  pathway  for  proteins  after  subcutaneous  administration.  The  contribution 
increases with increasing molecular weight and appears to be the predominant absorption pathway for 
proteins that are larger than 16 kDa (Roskos, 2006).

Study objectives 
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  and  compare  the  proposed  biosimilar  pegfilgrastim 
(pegylated  granulocyte  colony-stimulating  factor;  pegG-CSF)  with  Neulasta  (US-licensed)  reference 
comparator  in  healthy  volunteers  based  on  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  parameters 
following subcutaneous administration of a single 6 mg dose. 
Study design 
All subjects enrolled in the study received a single dose of either one of the aforementioned drugs at 
time  zero  (0)  for  each  period  of  the  study,  with  the  time  interval  between  the  consecutive  doses 
(wash-out period) of 8 weeks. The subjects were confined in the clinical facility 10 hours pre-dose until 
120 hours (day 5) post-dose. However, they had to return to the clinic for the 144 (Day 6), 168 (Day 
7), 192 (Day 8), 216 (Day 9), 240 (Day 10), 264 (Day 11), 288 (Day 12), 312 (Day 13) and 360 (Day 
15) hour sampling points and at 672 (Day 28) hour for immunogenicity and diagnostic sampling. 
Investigational products 
A  single,  6  mg  dose  of  pegfilgrastim  (Pelgraz  or  Neulasta)  was  administered  by  injection 
subcutaneously in the  upper arm to each subject at approximately the same time during each period 
(12 mg of pegfilgrastim in total to be administered over the course of the two periods of the study). 
Subjects  were  to  be  required  to  fast  for  at  least  10  hours  before  dosing  and  for  4  hours  thereafter. 
Water was not to be permitted from 2 hours before until 2 hours after dosing at which time 240 mL of 
water was to be consumed. Water was to be allowed ad lib at all other times. 
For  pegfilgastrim  plasma  concentration  measurements,  4  mL  blood  samples  were  taken  via  vacuum 
tubes  containing  K2EDTA  by  venipuncture  or  an  indwelling  catheter.  Two  4  mL  blood  samples  were 
taken 5–45 minutes prior to dosing time (0) followed by single 4 mL samples at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 
12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24 (Day 1), 28, 32, 36, 40, 48 (Day 2), 60, 72 (Day 3), 84, 96 (Day 4), 108, 120 
(Day  5),  144  (Day  6),  168  (Day  7),  192  (Day  8),  216  (Day  9),  240  (Day  10),264  (Day  11)  and  288 
(Day 12) hours after the s.c. injection of the study drug(s) in each period. 
Population studied and sample size calculation 
A maximum of 66 subjects were to be entered in this study to ensure 52 subjects completed the study. 
The determination of sample size was based on the following assumptions: estimated intrasubject CV 
of  30%  (expected  variability  of  pegfilgrastim),  a  formulation  difference  of  up to  5%  between  the two 
recombinant  pegfilgrastim  products,  and  statistical  power  of  90%  to  detect  a  20%  difference.  The 
sample  size  also  took  into  account  the  possibility  of  dropouts  and  subjects  dismissed  for  medical  or 
other reasons. 
The randomized volunteers included 66 subjects (49 males and 17 females), mean age was 40 years, 
mean  BMI  was  26  kg/m2.  Thirty-five  (35)  subjects  were  white,  4  were  black,  6  were  Asians  and  11 
were of other origin.  
Ten  subjects  (15.15%)  in  total  discontinued  from  the  study  -  4  subjects  Pelgraz  AS  vs.  6  subjects 
Neulasta. The main reasons for discontinuation were non-compliance with the study requirements, as 
subjects  did  not  attend  the  clinic  for  scheduled  visits  (4  subjects;  1  subject  Pelgraz  vs.  3  subjects 
Neulasta). Other discontinuations included 1 withdrawal by subject for personal reasons in the Pelgraz 
group.  Three  subjects  experienced  adverse  events,  1  subject  Pelgraz  with  abnormal  white  blood  cell 
count  vs.  2  subjects  Neulasta  with  1  subject  due  to  a  right  wrist  fracture  and  1  subject  due  to

hypersensitivity  that  was  classified  as  a  serious  adverse  event.  Two  subjects  were  withdrawn  due  to 
PK/PD  reasons  as  subjects  were  administered  IV  fluids  and  the  additional  fluid  volume  which  were 
assessed to have a potential impact on PK/PD measures (1 subject Pelgraz vs. 1 subject Neulasta). 
Protocol deviations 
The  protocol  deviations  observed  were  related  to  sampling  time  and  subject  monitoring  and  were 
documented for all 66 subjects over the course of the study. Five (5) subjects (7.58%) had deviations 
related  to  subject  monitoring  however  there  was  no  impact  on  subject  safety  and  on  PK/PD 
assessments. 
Conduct of the study 
Additional  protocol  deviations  occurred  after  completion  of  the  clinical  phase  of  the  study,  prior  to  or 
during  the  data  analysis  phase  of  the  study  such  as:  Adjustment  of  the  concentration  data  for 
pegfilgrastim  prior  to  the  pharmacokinetic  statistical  analysis  to  account  for  the  difference  in 
pegfilgrastim  content  of  greater  than  5%  between  Pelgraz  and  US-Licensed  Neulasta;  an  additional 
analysis  population,  Intention-to-  Treat  (ITT)  for  PD  data,  was  included  in  this  study;  Additional 
gender-specific  analyses  were  performed  in  this  study  for  information  purposes  only.  Prior  to 
performing  database lock and  unblinding  of  the  data,  a  supplementary  Statistical  Analysis  Plan  (SAP) 
was  prepared  in  advance  of  data  analysis  to  define  the  approach  to  be  used  to  examine  the  gender 
effects  within  each  treatment  for  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamics  measures,  and  any 
differences in gender effects between treatments.

Randomisation 
Randomization  was  to  be  done  according  to  the  crossover  design.  Half  of  the  volunteers  were  to 
receive  the  test  product  in  period  1  followed  by  the  reference  product  in  period  2  and  the  other  half 
were  to  receive  the  products  in  reverse  order.  Randomization  was  to  be  based  on  a  computer 
generated balanced randomization scheme..

Blinding (masking) 
This study used an assessor blinded design. To ensure blinding, the following measures were taken: 
1)  The  test  articles  were  placed  inside  brown  envelopes,  labelled  according  to  randomization 
scheme. 
2)  Staff  involved  with  packaging  of  test  articles  were  not  allowed  to  participate  in  other  study 
activities. 
3)  Dosing took  place in  an  office  where  only the  staff  dosing  (two  paramedics),  staff  verifying  the 
dosing  (two  management  staff)  and  two  subjects  to  be  dosed  were  present  at  the  same  time. 
Subjects  were  sitting  against  each  other  and  were  not  able  to  see  what  syringe  was  used  for 
dosing the other subject. 
4)  The Study Personnel in charge of recording adverse events/side effects were to be blinded to the 
dosing code. 
5)  The  laboratory  analysts  were  blinded  since  the  samples  were  identified  only  by  Study  code, 
Subject  Identification  No.—Period  No.—Sampling  Time  /  Day  and  they  were not  allowed  access 
to the dosing code until sample analysis had been complete. 
Statistical methods: Analysis sets 
-PK Statistical Analysis 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was to be performed on the logarithmic transformation of AUCt, AUCinf, 
Cmax, Cl and Vd and on the raw data for Tmax, Kel and Thalf parameters. The ANOVA model was to 
include sequence, subject within sequence, period, and treatment effects. The sequence effect was to 
be  tested  using  the  subject  within  sequence  mean  square  from  ANOVA  as  the  error  term.  All  other 
main  effects  were  to  be  tested  against  the  residual  error  (error  mean  square)  from  ANOVA  to  detect 
statistically significant differences (α=0.05). 
Least  squares  means  for  the  formulations  (treatments)  and  the  adjusted  difference  between 
formulation means together with the associated standard error were to be estimated using the SAS 
GLM procedure. The two one-sided hypothesis at the α=0.05 level of significance was to be tested for 
AUCt  and  Cmax  by  constructing  the  90%  confidence  interval  for  the  ratio  between  the  test  and 
reference formulation means for pegfilgrastim. 
-PD Statistical Analysis 
For  each  of  ANC  and  CD34+,  ANOVA  was  to  be  performed  on  the  logarithmic  transformation  of  the 
AUECt and Emax and on the raw data for Tmax. The ANOVA model was to include sequence, subject 
within sequence, period, and treatment effects. The sequence effect was to be tested using the subject 
within sequence mean square from ANOVA as the error term. All other main effects were to be tested 
against the residual error (error mean square) from ANOVA to detect statistically significant differences 
(α=0.05). 
Least  squares  means  for  the  formulations  (treatments)  and  the  adjusted  difference  between 
formulation  means  together  with  the  associated  standard  error  were  to  be  estimated  using  the  SAS 
GLM procedure. 
For ANC, the two one-sided hypothesis at the α=0.025 level of significance was to be tested for AUECt 
and  Emax  by  constructing  the  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  ratio  between  the  test  and  reference 
formulation means. 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018

For  CD34+,  the  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  ratio  between  the  test  and  reference  formulation 
means  for  PD  endpoints  of  absolute  CD34+  cell  counts  was  to  be  constructed  for  presentation 
purposes. 
Other statistical tests were to be performed, if necessary. 
-Safety Analysis 
Subjects  who  received  at  least  one  administration  of  pegfilgrastim  were  to  be  included  in  the  safety 
population  and  hence,  included  in  the  safety  data  analysis.  Safety  was  to  be  evaluated  through  the 
assessment  of  adverse  events,  laboratory  tests,  and  vital  signs  throughout  the  duration  of  the  study 
and up to 2weeks post-study. Safety analysis was to include immunogenicity testing. Safety data was 
to  be  analyzed  by  descriptive  statistics.Adverse  events  were  to  be  listed  and  tabulated  by  system 
organ  class  (SOC),  severity,  and  relationship  to  study  medication.  Incidence  rate  and  number  of  AEs 
and  SAEs  were  to  be  presented  in  a  frequency  table.  Number  and  percentage  of  out  of  range  and 
clinically significant laboratory values were to be tabulated.  
Results 
Since the drug content of the batches of Pelgraz and Neulasta employed in this study differed by more 
than 5%, any differences in PK parameter between the two products could be significantly obscured by 
this difference in drug content. To avoid bias by ensuring that the concentration data for pegfilgrastim 
was accurately reflective of the drug content of the test and reference products, prior to conducting the 
pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis, the pegfilgrastim concentration data for Pelgraz and Neulasta 
was  corrected  for  protein  content  and  purity.  The  adjustment  factor  for  Pelgraz  and  Neulasta  was 
based  on  the  actual  Certificate  of  Analysis  (CofA)  for  pegylated  filgrastim  protein  concentration  and 
purity data for each treatment. For Pelgraz the adjustment factor was 0.986, for Neulasta 1.066.  
For the analysis of adjusted pegfilgrastim data, plasma concentrations from 56 subjects were included 
in  the  PK  population.    Two  subjects  had  pre-dose  concentrations  in  period  2,  which  corresponded  to 
0.216 % and 0.881 % of their Cmax. Since the pegfilgrastim levels were low, the data obtained from 
these subjects were included in the PK/statistical analysis, as stipulated in the study protocol. No pre-
dose concentrations were detected in any other subject.

Distribution 
In  the  study  Pelgraz-02  the  volume  of  distribution  was  calculated  for  both  adjusted  and  unadjusted 
Apo-pegfilgrastim  and  Neulasta.  Adjusted  value  was  105461  ml  and  97139  ml  for  test  pegfilgrastim 
and  Neulasta,  respectively.  Unadjusted  value  103984  ml  and  103550  ml  for  test  pegfilgrastim  and 
Neulasta, respectively.  
Elimination 
The  observed  pharmacokinetics  of  pegfilgrastim  are  consistent  with  a  predominantly  neutrophil-
mediated clearance mechanism (Neulasta EPAR). Renal clearance is minimal (Yang et al, 2008). In CIN 
(chemotherapeutic  induced  neutropenia)  the  clearance  of  pegfilgrastim  is  significantly  reduced,  until 
neutrophil granulocyte recovery. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Healthy subjects: After subcutaneous administration of pegfilgrastim, the peak of the serum 
concentration-time profile became broader and the time to maximum concentration (Tmax) occurred 
at a later time with increasing dose (from 8 to 24 hours after dosing), suggesting that one of the 
clearance pathways for pegfilgrastim was saturated at high serum concentrations of pegfilgrastim.  A 
10-fold increase in the dose resulted in an approximately 25-fold increase in the maximum observed 
concentration (Cmax) and an approximately 75-fold increase in the AUC. 
Similar to observations in healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim appeared to be non-
linear  in  patients  with  NSCLC  before  and  after  chemotherapy.  After  chemotherapy,  pegfilgrastim 
reached a maximum concentration similar to that before chemotherapy for each dose level; however, 
the  maximum  concentration  was  sustained  for  a  longer  period  of  time  and  began  to  decline  rapidly 
only at the onset of neutrophil recovery. The exposure to pegfilgrastim (AUC) after chemotherapy was

higher  than  that  before  chemotherapy,  supporting  the  hypothesis  that  neutrophils  and  neutrophil 
precursors play an important role in the elimination of pegfilgrastim.  
In  a  dose-ranging  study,  women  with  high-risk  stage  II,  III  or  IV  breast  cancer  received  a  single 
subcutaneous  dose  of  pegfilgrastim  at  30,  60  or  100  mg/kg  24  hours  after  completion  of 
doxorubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy; treatment was repeated every 21 days for up to four cycles. The 
exposure to pegfilgrastim was lower in chemotherapy cycle 3 than in cycle 1, while an improvement in 
ANC  nadir  and  a  decrease  in  duration  of  neutropenia  occurred  in  cycle  2  and  subsequent  cycles  of 
treatment,  suggesting  that  an  expansion  of  neutrophil  and  neutrophil  precursor  mass  in  the  later 
cycles resulted in an increase in drug clearance (Yang, 2011).

Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
BIOEQUIVALENCE  STUDY:  A  new  PK/PD  study  (154-14).  Protocol  No.  154-14.  Celerion 
Project No. CA21285 
This was an assessor blind, balanced, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, single-dose, 2-
waycrossover, comparative, SC, 2 dose levels [3 mg/0.3 mL and 6 mg/0.6 mL; INTP5 of Intas 
Pharmaceuticals Ltd., India and Neulasta of AMGEN (EU-licensed product)] PK/PD studyin healthy, 
normal, adult, human subjects under fasting conditions separated by a washout period of 8 weeks. 
In each dose level group, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, a single dose of Pegfilgrastim 3 
mg/0.3 mL (either of INTP5, Test product T1 or Neulasta, Reference product R1) or 6 mg/0.6 mL 
(either of INTP5, Test product T2 or Neulasta, Reference product R2) was administered subcutaneously 
to the outer area of the right upper arm to each subject in each period. 
In this study, 6 mg and 3 mg doses were evaluated to determine the bioequivalence and safety. 
The study was performed with the EU-approved reference product. Both batches were tested before 
expiry date and the CoAs show a similar content. Therefore, content correction is not necessary. 
A total of 28 blood samples were collected for PK evaluation at the following times: Pre-dose(within 60 
minutes prior to dosing) and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 30,36, 42, 48, 60, 72, 96, 
120, 144, 168, 192, 240, 288, and 336 hours post-dose. 
As per the plan, a total of 344 subjects (172 subjects per dose level group) entered the study and were 
randomized to study treatment. A total of 299 subjects completed the study (there were 148 
completers for the 3 mg/0.3 mL dose level group and 151 completers for the6 mg/0.6 mL dose level 
group).  
In healthy volunteers, maximal pegfilgrastim concentrations are observed between 8-48 hours post-
dosing, depending on the dose. Terminal elimination half-life is approximately 46-62 hours. Therefore, 
the proposed time points seem adequate to describe the pharmacokinetic profile of pegfilgrastim for 
evaluation of comparability of Pelgraz and Neulasta. The 14 day sampling interval would correspond to 
approximately 5 half-lives and would allow covering at least 80% of the AUC. Based on the results it is 
also noteworthy that a review of the AUC0-t and AUCinf data for both Pelgraz and Neulasta treatments 
demonstrates that the AUC0-t parameter provides a reliable estimate of the extent of exposure for both 
the test and reference treatments as the AUC0-t covered > 99% of AUCinf. 
The 56 days washout period between the two administrations seems sufficient to prevent carry-over 
and no pre-dose levels were detected. 
The selection of AUC0-tlast as primary PK endpoint is in line with the Guidance on similar medicinal 
products containing recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005). Cmax is also evaluated as primary endpoint, which is in line with the 
Guidance mentioned above, and to the Biosimilar Guideline (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1) in 
which, AUC0-inf and Cmax should be evaluated as co-primary endpoint for subcutaneously administered 
products. In conclusion, the PK endpoints are considered acceptable since the AUC0-inf, AUC0-t and Cmax 
has been assessed. 
AUC determination by standard non-compartmental linear trapezoidal rule is considered adequate. 
The statistical method employed by the Applicant is PROC MIXED of SAS is considered acceptable as 
only subjects with observations in both treatment were used (there were no missing data).

Since the interaction terms group*sequence and treatment*group were not statistically significant the 
model was simplified for all PK parameters in both PK statistical comparisons (T1 versus R1 and T2 
versus R2). The method including subjects (sequence), sequence, period and treatment was used to 
obtain the 90%CI for the ratios test/reference.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
G-CSF is a hematopoietic growth factor which regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone 
marrow; endogenous G-CSF is a glycoprotein produced by monocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial 
cells. G-CSF promotes the growth, proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of neutrophil 
precursors. It induces their terminal differentiation and enhances the function of mature neutrophils by 
increasing phagocytic activity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. 
Assessment report

The addition of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety to filgrastim (rHu-met-G-CSF, with an identical 
sequence to the endogenous one, except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine necessary for 
expression in E. coli.) resulted in the development of pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is produced by 
conjugating methoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG)-propionaldehyde (20 kDa) to the N-terminal 
methionine residue of G-CSF. Pegfilgrastim is a long-acting form of filgrastim. Pegfilgrastim retains the 
same biological activity as filgrastim, and binds to the same G-CSF receptor, stimulating the 
proliferation, differentiation and activation of neutrophils (Curran and Goa, 2002; Neulasta CPM).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology study Pelgraz-02  
For the pharmacodynamic characterization of absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), blood samples were 
drawn prior to the dosing time (0 hours) and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 48, 60, 72, 84, 
96, 108, 120, 144, 168, 216, 264, 312 and 360 hours after dosing. 
For the pharmacodynamic characterization of absolute CD34+ cell counts (CD34+), blood samples 
were drawn prior to the dosing time (0 hours) and at 24, 48, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 144 168, 192, 240 
and 288 hours after dosing. Blood samples for immunogenicity assessment were taken prior to Period 
1 dosing (0 hours) and at 672 hours after dosing in both periods 1 and 2. 
Endpoints 
Primary PD endpoints were the AUECt and Emax parameters of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC). 
Secondary endpoints were: Tmax (for ANC endpoint), AUECt and Emax (for CD34+ endpoint). 
The tertiary PD endpoint for CD34+ was the Tmax parameter. 
Calculation of PD parameters was performed using the Enterprise Pharmacology (EP 2.5) software. The 
statistical analysis of the PD data was performed using SAS software version 8.2. 
PD Statistical Analysis: For ANC and absolute CD34+ cell count data, ANOVA was performed on the 
log-transformed AUECt and Emax parameters and on the untransformed Tmax parameter (Proc GLM of 
SAS).  The  ANOVA  included  sequence,  subjects  nested  within  sequence,  period  and  treatment  as 
factors. The significance of the sequence effect was tested using the subjects nested within sequence 
as  the  error  term.  Based  on  the  same  statistical  model,  the  least-squares  means  for  the  treatments, 
the  adjusted  differences  between  the  treatment  means  and  the  standard  error  associated  with  these 
differences were estimated. 
For the ANC data, the two one-sided hypothesis was tested at the α=0.025 level of significance by 
constructing the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the ratio between the test and reference 
means. 
For the absolute CD34+ cell count data, the 95% CI for the ratio between the test and reference 
means was constructed for information purposes. 
The PD statistical analyses included descriptive statistics across subjects and within treatments, 
periods and sequences.

Pharmacodynamic Results : 
Figure 4 1- ANC 
For both treatments, ANC increased as expected after single dose subcutaneous (SC) dose 
administration with peak levels occurring at approximately 64 hours and 61 hours post dose for Pelgraz 
and Neulasta respectively, and returning towards baseline levels by approximately 360 hours post-
dose. A summary of the corresponding PD endpoint parameters is presented below.

Criteria for PD Evaluation: A total of 20 blood samples were collected for PD evaluation from pre-dose 
(within 60 minutes prior to dosing) up to 672 hours post-dose. PD markers ANC and CD34+ were 
analysed using automated cell counter and flow cytometer, respectively, using validated methods at 
Lambda Therapeutic Research Ltd., India. The following PD parameters were calculated from the

baseline-adjusted and baseline non-adjusted ANC and CD34+ versus time profiles: AUEC0-t, Emax,

Statistical Methods: Pharmacodynamics: Summary statistics, including sample size (n, arithmetic 
mean, SD, CV%, SEM, median, minimum, and maximum) were calculated for all nominal time points 
and ANC and CD34+ PD parameters. In addition, IQR, geometric means, and geometric CV% were 
presented for all PD parameters. A comparison of ln-transformed PD parameters Emax and AUEC0-t, 
for baseline-adjusted and baseline non-adjusted ANC and CD34+ was made to evaluate the relative 
response of T1 versus R1 and T2 versus R2, by performing an ANOVA model, similar to PK model for 
subjects in the PD evaluable population only. An additional statistical comparison that included 
excluded subjects was presented for supportive information only. Biosimilarity was concluded if the 
95% CIs for the baseline-adjusted ANC Emax and AUEC0-t GMRs of T2 versus R2 lay within the 
80.00% to 125.00% reference interval.

Secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity:  
A total of 190 samples were collected from subjects and analysed using a multi-tiered approach to 
screen, confirm, and report a relative ADA concentration (titer). Confirmed positive samples were also 
characterized for specificity and neutralizing activity.  
Based on the test results of the 190 samples from 66 subjects, 16 samples from 10 subjects were 
reported as potential positive in the ADA screening assay and were subsequently analyzed in the 
confirmatory assay. Of the 16 samples analyzed, 10 samples from 6 subjects were confirmed positive 
in the ADA confirmatory assay and underwent further characterization for binding specificity and 
neutralizing activity.  
None of the 66 subjects dosed in Period 1 had confirmed positive ADAs at baseline (pre- dose) 
samples. Therefore the prevalence of pre-existing antibodies in this study was 0% (0/66). In Period 1, 
three subjects (GC01, GC50 and GC66) had detectable treatment emergent ADA after receiving 
Pelgraz in Period 1, representing an incidence of 9% (3 out of 33). Titers at 672 hrs in Period 1 for 
these subjects ranged from 1- 8. Three subjects (GC24, GC34 and GC62) had detectable treatment

emergent ADA after receiving Neulasta in Period 1, representing an incidence of 9% (3 out of 33). 
Titers at 672 hrs in Period 1 for these subjects ranged from 1-14.  
There was no apparent difference in induction or magnitude of ADA after exposure to either Pelgraz or 
Neulasta.  
In Period 2 of this study, with a crossover design, 27 subjects received Pelgraz (after prior exposure to 
Neulasta) and 30 subjects received Neulasta (after prior exposure to Pelgraz). No additional subjects 
developed ADA in Period 2 of this study and no ADA positive subjects had increased ADA titers. Two 
subjects became ADA negative; therefore, 4 subjects were positive for ADA at the end of Period 2. 
Titers at Period 2 ranged from 1 to 12.  
The results showed that the majority of the ADA positive subjects (5 of 6 subjects or 83%) were 
positive for anti-PEG antibodies (8 out of 10 samples or 80.0%). Antibodies were detected to Apo-
Filgrastim in 4 subjects (67%; 6 of 10 samples or 60%) and to recombinant human granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (rhuGCSF) in 2 subjects (33%; 3 of 10 samples or 30%). The results of the 
confirmed ADA positive samples from the 6 subjects were tested in the cell-based assay to evaluate 
the presence of antibodies with neutralizing activity. All confirmed ADA positive samples tested 
negative for neutralizing antibodies.  
The binding specificity evaluated in the characterization assays of ADAs can be summarized in 5 
categories:  
a.  Binding specific to Pelgraz AS, rhuGCSF and PEG  
b.  Binding specific only to Pelgraz AS and PEG 
c.  Binding specific only to rhuGCSF and PEG 
d.  Binding specific only to Pelgraz AS

Table 29 Summary of Immunogenicity Results for ADA Confirmed Positive Subjects 
To more closely examine any potential impact of ADA on the data, the rate and extent of drug 
exposure (i.e., AUCt, Cmax) and clearance rate (Cl) of Pelgraz and Neulasta (Reference), parameters 
which had the potential of being influenced by ADA, were presented using scatter plots for all subjects 
included in the PK population (n=56).  
The Cmax, AUCt and Clearance values for subjects GC01, GC24, GC34, GC50, GC62, and GC66 were 
consistent with the rest of the subjects in this study. For all ADA-positive subjects except GC01, the 
magnitude of Period 2 data was not substantially different from that of Period 1, and was in the range 
of other subjects in the study. Even though Subject GC01 was associated with relatively high P1/P2 
ratios, the Cmax and AUCt values within both periods/treatments were in line with the values obtained 
for the rest of the subjects in the study. Therefore, it is concluded that ADA development did not have 
an attributable impact on the extent and rate of exposure or clearance of pegfilgrastim.

The titer levels observed in the ADA-positive subjects in this study are considered very low (range 1-14 
after minimum required dilution of 1:20). 
With respect to the PD parameters, the ANC and CD34+ Emax and AUECt values for the subjects who 
were confirmed ADA-positive (GC01, GC24, GC34, GC50, GC62, and GC66) were in line with the 
values obtained from the rest of the subjects in the study as illustrated in the plots below. Overall, 
there is no evidence to support a significant impact of ADA development on the pharmacodynamics of 
pegfilgrastim.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology  
The Pelgraz development program utilized a step-wise approach and included an analytical similarity 
exercise for Pelgraz with both EU-approved and US-licensed Neulasta to demonstrate similarity in the 
quality attributes of the proposed biosimilar and the reference biologic drug Neulasta - in order to 
generate data that supports the establishment of a scientific bridge between the two reference 
products. Furthermore, both EU-approved Neulasta (RMP) and US-licensed Neulasta were used in the 
non-clinical and clinical (Phase III) studies and the US-licensed Neulasta was used in the Phase I 
PK/PD study. 
The clinical comparability exercise begins with pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) 
comparative studies followed by comparative clinical efficacy trial versus the chosen reference 
medicinal product. Additionally, the pivotal Phase III 3-arm Efficacy and Safety Study   conducted in 
breast cancer patients on docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) chemotherapy, 
comparing Pelgraz to both US-licensed and EU-approved Neulasta. 
In general, the Applicant´s development programme to demonstrate the similarity between Pelgraz 
and Neulasta with respect to the pharmacokinetic (PK) is considered adequate and was performed 
according to the guidance on biosimilars. 
This study Pelgraz-02 was a phase I, comparative, randomized, single-dose, assessor-blinded, 2-way 
crossover PK/PD study of subcutaneously administered Pelgraz (Test) and Neulasta (reference) (USA) 
in healthy volunteer subjects under fasting conditions separated by a washout period of 8 weeks. 
The 6 mg SC dose was selected because it is the only dose approved and used as current standard of 
care for the comparator product Neulasta and therapeutic comparability was based on the clinical 
efficacy endpoint DSN in the first cycle of chemotherapy in a comparative way. 
The selection of AUC0-tlast as primary PK endpoint is in line with the Guidance on similar medicinal 
products containing recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005). Cmax is also evaluated as primary endpoint, which is in line with the 
Guidance mentioned above, and to the Biosimilar Guideline (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1) in 
which, AUC0-inf and Cmax should be evaluated as co-primary endpoint for subcutaneously administered 
products. In addition, AUCinf should also be considered as primary PK endpoint according to the PKWP 
Assessment report

document in the assessment of biosimilarity since AUCinf reflects CL/F for subcutaneously administered 
products. In conclusion, the PK endpoints are considered acceptable since the AUC0-inf, AUC0-t and Cmax 
has been assessed. 
Prior to performing the PK/PD statistical analysis, a treatment-blinded review of the pegfilgrastim, ANC 
and CD34+ data was performed by evaluating the data and comparing the period 1 versus period 2 
data for each subject. The blinded review of the pegfilgrastim concentration-time data for all subjects 
revealed that the concentration-time profiles for subject GC01 and GC02 were not consistent between 
periods. This is not considered acceptable. However, as the two subjects under investigation were 
finally included in the dataset, this issue is considered irrelevant. 
For the adjusted data, the results demonstrate that the 90% confidence interval of the test/reference 
ratio for the primary PK endpoints of the study, AUC0-t and Cmax, are within 80–125% and the 100% 
was included within the 90 % CI. Moreover, the secondary and tertiary PK endpoints further support 
the PK conclusions of this study as the 90% confidence intervals for the AUCinf, Cl and Vd parameters 
are contained within 80-125% and the 90% confidence intervals for the untransformed parameters 
t max, K el and t half are also contained within the limits of 80-125%. 
Following the clinical phase of the study and prior to conducting the pharmacokinetic and statistical 
analysis, it was noted that the applied dose of Pelgraz appeared to be on average higher by 5% than 
the dose of Neulasta used as the reference product and an statistical analysis in which adjustment for 
drug content was performed prior to performing database lock and unblinding of data and statistical 
analysis of the data. Based on the information submitted, it appears that the decision to adjust was not 
made after unblinding of the study. A specific memo detailing the need of drug content-adjustment of 
data was issued by the sponsor to the PK/stats group prior to unblinding the study data. This memo 
was issued on March 28th, 2014, prior to database lock on March 31st, 2014 and prior to unblinding of 
the study on 1 April 01st, 2014.  Adjustment was based on the measured pegfilgrastim protein 
concentration and purity data as listed on the Certificate of Analysis for each product to account for the 
difference in pegfilgrastim content between the batches of Pelgraz and US-licensed Neulasta used in 
this study in order to meet the predefined acceptance range. 
Results based on the unadjusted data demonstrate that the 90% confidence interval of the 
test/reference ratio for the primary, secondary and tertiary PK endpoints of the study are within 80–
125% with the exception of AUC0-t which had an upper limit of 125.5% and for Cl which had a lower 
limit of 79.7%. In our opinion AUCinf is more relevant for biosimilars that AUC0-t since it reflects CL/F, 
and the results for the AUC0-inf demonstrate that the 90% confidence interval of the test/reference 
ratio is within 80–125%.  
The  AUCinf  could  not  be determined  in  3  subjects  for  reference  product  and  in  6  subjects  for the  test 
product and it appears that the subjects were excluded based on the SOP criteria. When these subjects 
data  were  considered  the  results  change  slightly  and  AUC  90%  CI  for  the  ratio  test  /  reference  falls 
slightly  outside  of  the  predefined  acceptance  range  80-125%  if  the  data  is  not  adjusted,  but  it  is 
expected that it will be within the limits if adjusted. 
In  addition,  the  Applicant has  conducted  an  additional  comparative  PK  and  PD  study  (study  154-14), 
an  Assessor  Blind,  Randomized,  Single-Dose,  Crossover,  Comparative  Pharmacokinetic  and 
Pharmacodynamic Study of Two Dose Levels Of INTP5 with Two Dose Levels of Neulasta (EU-Licensed

parameters  (AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf,  and  Cmax)  of  the  test  product,  INTP5,  relative  to  the  reference  product, 
EU-Neulasta, were within the 80.00% to 125.00% reference interval. Therefore, it confirmed that the 
applied product exhibits a similar exposure.

The Pharmacodynamics of Pelgraz were assessed in a single phase 1 PK/PD study (APO-Peg-02), which 
included healthy volunteers and compared the PK/PD characteristics of Pelgraz and US-licensed 
Neulasta (Amgen Inc.). The possibility to use a non-EU authorised comparator in part of the 
comparability exercise is reflected in the CHMP guideline for biosimilars (“Guideline on similar biological 
medicinal products CHMP/437/04 Rev 1”). The pivotal PK/PD study was a single-dose, randomized, 
assessor-blinded, two-way crossover, active-controlled, study in healthy volunteers. The primary PD 
endpoints were the AUECt and Emax parameters of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), while 
secondary endpoints were: Tmax (for ANC endpoint), AUECt and Emax (for CD34+ endpoint).  The 
95% CI of the primary PD endpoint parameters (ANC-AUECt and ANC-Emax) were within the pre-
defined acceptance margins of 80-125%, as well as those for ANC-Tmax and CD34+ cells-AUECt and 
Emax (secondary endpoints). Results were consistent between the PD population (patients who 
completed both periods) and the ITT population (patients who received at least one dose of the 
investigational product).  
Further a new PK/PD study was submitted.  In this newly submitted PK/PD study (154-14), the 95% 
CIs of the GMRs derived from the analysis on the ln-transformed baseline non-adjusted ANC PD 
parameters AUEC0-t and Emax of the test product, INTP5, relative to the reference product, Neulasta, 
were also within the 80.00% to 125.00% interval. Therefore, from a PK/PD perspective, results from 
study 154-14 demonstrated comparability between INTP5 and EU-Neulasta. 
Overall, the findings conducted in healthy volunteers show a low immunogenic potential of Pelgraz, 
with no apparent differences between Pelgraz and Neulasta (US-licensed). Data presented indicate that 
there is no evidence to support a significant impact of ADA development on the pharmacokinetics or 
pharmacodynamics of Pelgraz or Neulasta (see clinical Efficacy and safety sections).  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From a PK/PD perspective, results from available studies demonstrated comparability between Pelgraz 
AS and Neulasta.   
Overall the findings from the study conducted in healthy volunteers show a low immunogenic potential 
of Pelgraz, with no apparent differences between Pelgraz and Neulasta (US-licensed). Data presented 
from healthy volunteers indicate that there is no evidence of a significant impact of ADA development 
on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Pelgraz or Neulasta.

Treatments 
Table 30 Investigational medicinal products  
Non-investigational medicinal products: 
The only allowed chemotherapy regimen for this study was TAC, consisting of: 
• 
• 
docetaxel 75 mg/m2 i.v. Day 1 
doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 i.v. Day 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 67/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 i.v. Day 1. 
Premedication for Chemotherapy:  
Antiemetic treatment with dexamethasone and ondansetron were required to improve the cytostatic 
tolerability. Dexamethasone premedication (six doses of 8 mg by mouth, twice daily) started on the 
day before chemotherapy and ended in the evening of the day after chemotherapy in order to prevent 
docetaxel-related hypersensitivity and fluid retention. Three doses of dexamethasone were prescribed 
to be taken before administration of chemotherapy. Ondansetron (8 mg) premedication was given to 
prevent chemotherapy related nausea and vomiting. It could be given either orally or intravenously, 
and it was given before and approximately 12 hours after chemotherapy.  
Prior and Concomitant Treatments 
Prior therapy (i.e. any therapy given 4 weeks prior to the screening visit) was recorded in the eCRFs. 
In the event that additional concomitant therapy became necessary during the study treatment period 
(i.e. any medication starting on or before Week 20), those also had to be documented. Any change in 
documented, permitted concomitant medication being taken at the beginning of the clinical study had 
to be dose, duration, and indication. If the administration of a non-permitted concomitant medication 
became necessary, participation in the study was discontinued prematurely in that subject. 
Use of other concurrent haematopoietic growth factors was not allowed by the protocol. Use of other 
biotechnologically produced medications, medications which could have potentiated the release of 
neutrophils, such as lithium and medications known to lower platelet count were discouraged, but if 
considered necessary had to be discussed with the study medical monitor. 
Primary prophylactic antibiotic therapy was not allowed, in line with NCCN, Practice Guidelines in 
Oncology, Myeloid growth factors, NCCN 2011 Myeloid Growth Factors. Secondary antibiotic 
prophylaxis was initiated upon development of episode of febrile neutropenia and was implemented in 
accordance with the recommendations of NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, Prevention and 
Treatment of Cancer Related Infections, (NCCN 2011 Cancer Related Infections). 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate an equivalent efficacy of Pelgraz as compared 
to US and EU licensed Neulasta in subjects suffering from early breast cancer and receiving TAC. 
Secondary objectives: 
• To assess the safety of Pelgraz as compared to that of Neulasta US and Neulasta EU when 
administered through 6 cycles of TAC anticancer chemotherapy. 
• To assess the potential antigenicity of Pelgraz during chemotherapy and 30 weeks after the 
completion of chemotherapy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 68/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in Cycle 1. Severe neutropenia was defined as ANC below 0.5 x 
109/L. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
• The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 severe neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and <0.5 x 109/L, 
respectively) in Cycle 1. 
•  The depth and peak of ANC nadir in Cycle 1. 
• 
The time to the post nadir ANC recovery (ANC ≥2.0 x 109/L) in Cycle 1. 
• The rates of febrile neutropenia by cycle and across the cycles.  
• The ANC-time profile in Cycle 1 (time from beginning chemotherapy to the occurrence of the ANC 
nadir). 
• The frequency and type of (culture-confirmed) infections. 
• The incidence of intravenous (i.v.) antibiotic therapy and hospitalization. 
• The mobilization of CD34+ cells (in selected centres only) in Cycle 1. 
• Incidence, severity and distribution of bone pain. 
• Percentage of scheduled chemotherapy dose that was delivered. 
• Proportion of subjects with chemotherapy doses reduced, omitted, or delayed. 
• Number of days of delay of chemotherapy. 
• Occurrence and/or resolution of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. 
Sample size 
The required sample size for efficacy evaluation was calculated based on equivalence design (two 
separate equivalence tests for comparison to Neulasta US and Neulasta EU) and based on the standard 
deviation (SD=1.4 days) of DSN in Cycle 1 reported by Green et al. 2003. 
To test the equivalent efficacy of Pelgraz as compared to Neulasta US and Neulasta EU, sample sizes of 
135 subjects in each reference product treatment arm and 270 in the investigational treatment arm 
were needed to achieve 90% power for the 95% CI of the difference in mean DSN to be within the 
equivalence range of [-0.5 day, +0.5 day]. Anticipating a 10% attrition/or protocol deviation rate in 
Cycle 1 (it is justifiable according to previous publications (Green et al. 2003), enrolment of 600 
subjects (300 subjects for Pelgraz arm and 150 subjects for each Neulasta arm) was determined to be 
needed to achieve the required number of evaluable subjects to test the equivalence of Pelgraz and 
Neulasta US and Neulasta EU. In calculating the sample size, a difference of 0.05 day in mean DSN 
between products was assumed. 
Beside efficacy consideration, requirements regarding safety were also taken into account when 
selecting the sample size for the study.

Randomisation 
The randomization scheme was generated by using SAS Software version 9.3. Permuted block 
randomization was used and block size were as considered as blinded information. 
Blinding (masking) 
The investigator performing the assessments (the assessor), the study subjects as well as all other 
sponsor/clinical research organization (CRO) personnel monitoring and analyzing the study had to 
remain blinded. Unblinded team members were identified at each centre whose role in the study was 
limited to handling the IMP test and reference products (a pharmacist, an investigator and/or a study 
nurse not involved in other study procedures or assessments). Unblinded team members were 
responsible for the receipt, accountability, and administration of pegfilgrastim. Treatment assignment 
was not allowed to be disclosed to the investigator or any sponsor representative except the site 
monitor responsible for unblinded monitoring.  
Statistical methods 
Demonstration of equivalent efficacy of Pelgraz as compared to Neulasta US and Neulasta EU was 
performed. To test the equivalence of Pelgraz and each Neulasta product (US and EU) the 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the difference (Pelgraz minus Neulasta) of DSN in Cycle 1 was calculated. 
The two-sided 95% CIs were derived from a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model accounting 
for the treatment effect. For declaring equivalence, the CI had to lie within the equivalence range of [-
0.5 to +0.5 day]. The effects of baseline ANC and the interaction between country and treatment were 
examined, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Secondary efficacy endpoints were calculated and 
summarized for all treatment arms. Log transformation was applied for the secondary endpoints to 
satisfy the normality assumption. 
Safety endpoints were summarized using descriptive statistics.  
The following analysis populations were planned for the study: 
•  Safety Analysis Set (SAS): The SAS included all enrolled subjects who received at least one dose 
of the active treatment. 
•  Full Analysis set (FAS): The FAS comprised all enrolled subjects who received at least one dose 
of the active treatment and who provided any follow-up data for the primary target variables. 
•  Per Protocol Analysis Set (PP): Subjects having protocol deviations affecting the integrity of the 
data  and  the  endpoint  of  the  efficacy  analysis/safety  and  well-being  of  the  subjects,  with 
premature  termination  of  the  treatment  due  to  reasons  that  were  definitely  not  related  to  study 
medication,  were  excluded  from  the  PP  analyses.  Handling  of  drop-outs  and  missing  values  were 
performed as for the full analysis dataset. 
In the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) the primary analysis set was the FAS, in line with the intent-to-
treat principle. The FAS was analysed with subjects allocated As Randomized (i.e., regardless of any 
mixed dosing) and As Treated (subjects were allocated to the treatment they received in each cycle). 
The FAS-As Randomized and the SAS were identical in this study.  
The prespecified primary analysis set was the FAS-As Randomized.

Recruitment 
In total, 58 study centres screened subjects (out of 81 initiated centres) in 12 countries (Hungary, 
Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, 
Georgia, Armenia and Russia). 
The study took place from Mar 28, 2012 until May 30, 2014 (end of the safety follow-up phase). 
Conduct of the study 
Amendments: 
There  were  three  protocol  amendments  and  two  country-specific  amendments  to  the  initial  clinical 
study protocol. The main amendments and changes are mentioned below. 
Amendment 1 (13.1.2012) consisted of the following main changes: 
• 
• 
The number of subjects was changed from 105 to 150 for each Neulasta arm, 210 subjects to 
300 in the Pelgraz arm. Therefore, the total number was increased from 420 to 600 subjects. 
The number of study centres was modified from up to 74 to 120. 
The exact time of anti-infective treatment was clarified; at least 72 hours should have elapsed 
between the last dose of anti-infective treatment and TAC administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018

• 
The equivalence range was changed from [-0.8 day, +0.8 day] to [-0.5 day, +0.5 day] within 
the  statistical  methods  section,  defining  a  new  sample  size  as  reflected  in  the  first  bullet.  To 
test the equivalent efficacy of Pelgraz as compared to Neulasta US and Neulasta EU based on 
the revised equivalence range, sample sizes of 135 subjects in each reference arm and 270 in 
the  investigational  treatment  arm  were  needed  to  achieve  90%  power  for  the  95%  CI  of  the 
difference in mean DSN to be within the equivalence range of [-0.5 day, +0.5 day].  
Amendment 2 (25.6.2012) included administrative changes, typing omissions and addition of the most 
recent version of Helsinki Declaration. 
Amendment 3 (21.11.2012) consisted of the following main changes: 
•  Blood sampling for blood chemistry assessment was allowed to be done on Day 0 or Day 1. 
•  CDISC  standards  concerning  AE  severity  assessment  and  clarification  of  AEs  outcome  were 
implemented. 
Protocol deviations: 
• 
Exclusion  of  Subjects  from  the  PP  (Cycle  1)  Analysis  Set:  Based  on  the  assessment  and 
classification  of  the  protocol  deviations,  46  (7.8%)  subjects  were  excluded  from  PP  Analysis 
Set for Cycle 1, resulting in 543 subjects in this analysis set.  
Table 31 Subjects Excluded from PP (Cycle 1) Analysis Set 
•  Additional Subjects Excluded from the PP (All Cycles) Analysis Set Due to Deviations in  Cycles 2-6: 
An additional 55 (9.3%) subjects were excluded from the PP (All Cycles) Analysis Set due to 
deviations in Cycle 2-6, resulting in 488 subjects in this analysis set.

A similar distribution in the incidence of both Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia was also evident 
between the treatment arms in the FAS-As Treated Analysis Set in Cycle 1: Grade 3 neutropenia 
occurred in 9.4%, 13.6% and 9.0% of subjects in the Pelgraz, Neulasta US and Neulasta EU arms, 
respectively, and Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 76.8%, 74.8% and 80.6% subjects. 
Results for the PP Analysis Set in Cycle 1 were: Grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 9.8%, 14.4% and 
9.9% of subjects in the Pelgraz, Neulasta US and Neulasta EU arms, respectively, and Grade 4 
neutropenia occurred in 77.8%, 73.9% and 79.3% subjects, respectively.

ANC Characteristics in Cycle 1 
In Cycle 1, blood samples were collected for complete blood counts with differentials on Day 0, 1, 3, 5, 
6, 7, and every day until post-nadir ANC recovery to ≥ 2.0 x 109/L or up to Day 15, if recovery did not 
occur earlier. 
The results for FAS-As Treated were similar. 
Results for the PP Analysis Set were consistent with those for the FAS-As Randomized Analysis Set.

The results for PP Analysis Set were similar.  
Maximum duration of febrile neutropenia was 7 days but for the majority of subjects was less than 5 
days. Febrile neutropenia did not necessitate delay in TAC administration, or reduction in TAC dose.

Intravenous Antibiotic Therapy and Hospitalization 
The similar results were also obtained in PP Analysis Set and FAS-As Treated population. 
The slightly higher incidence of hospitalizations in the Pelgraz arm was due to the slightly higher rate 
of febrile neutropenia/neutropenia in the Pelgraz arm: 8 cases (2.7%) requiring hospitalization 
compared with 3 (2.0%) and 3 (2.0%) cases, respectively in the US-Neulasta and EU-Neulasta arms. 
Also there were 5 subjects (1.7%) in the Pelgraz arm with SAEs requiring hospitalization that were 
unrelated to IMP, compared with 1 subject (0.7%) with IMP-related toxic skin eruption in the US-
Neulasta arm and 1 subject (0.7%) with cholecystitis (unrelated to IMP) in the EU-Neulasta arm.

Figure 20 Pelgraz-03 Percent of Subjects with Bone Pain- FAS-As Randomized 
Occurrence and/or Resolution of Chemotherapy-Induced Mucositis 
Oral mucositis is a common complication of cytoreductive cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The 
reporting incidence was 39 (6.6%) cases of oral mucositis during the course of the study and all cases 
were resolved, usually without treatment. The frequencies across the three therapeutic arms were 
similar with 21 (7.1%) subjects in the Pelgraz, 12 (8.1%) subjects in US-Neulasta and 6 (4.1%) 
subjects in EU-Neulasta arms, respectively. 
Frequencies of Deviations from Originally Planned Chemotherapy (including doses delayed, reduced 
and omitted) 
The dose of TAC therapy was calculated based on the subject BSA. More than a 5% difference to the 
baseline body weight meant the dose had to be recalculated. Dose reduction by 25% was possible if 
the subject had Grade 3/4 non-haematopoietic toxicities, two Grade 3/4 infectious episodes, or Grade 
4 thrombocytopenia. Treatment could be terminated if non-haematologic Grade 4 toxic effects 
developed or persisted, Grade 3 toxic effects occurred despite a dose reduction, or a clinically 
significant cardiac event developed.  
Deviations occurring in Cycle 1 could result in subject exclusion from both PP Analysis Sets, for the 
primary endpoint and for the whole study (ie. deviation of >5% in administered chemotherapy dose). 
Deviations, occurring in Cycles 2-6 resulted in the exclusion of the subject from the PP Analysis Set for 
later cycles.

Country 
As an exploratory analysis the efficacy was assessed using descriptive statistics to compare results 
from the countries with clinical trial sites in Pelgraz-03. As the study was conducted in Eastern and 
Central Europe, the study population provides a good representation of the North American and 
European population. 
Subjects were screened in 58 centers from 12 countries and randomized in 56 centers from 11 
countries, where 589 subjects were randomized and dosed. Although study procedures were 
standardized as per protocol, potential site or center effect was examined in an exploratory manner. As 
subject number per site was not balanced with respect to the treatment allocation and some sites had 
few subjects, summary of DSN in cycle 1 was presented by country. 
Pooling was performed to combine data from countries Slovakia, Czech Republic and Poland as these 
countries had very low number of subjects.  
The mean (SD) DSN between the three treatment arms are comparable in most countries; small 
variation of mean DSN was detected in countries with the largest number of subjects (Bulgaria, 
Georgia, and Hungary). The largest variation was observed for the pooled unit including Slovakia, 
Poland and Czech Republic [(Pelgraz treatment: 3.0 (1.41); US-Neulasta treatment: 0.7 (0.58); EU-
Neulasta treatment: 1.7 (1.03)]. 
For FAS-As Randomized, the main effect of country was statistically significant (P<0.001). Differences 
between countries are not uncommon in studies in which endpoints are measured in local laboratories. 
It is noteworthy however, that differences between treatment arms within most countries of this study 
were consistently small, which is suggestive of the lack of interaction between country and treatment 
effect.

Immunogenicity 
Based on the test results of the 5421 samples, from 589 subjects dosed, 147 samples from 47 subjects 
were reported as potential positive in the ADA screening assay and were subsequently analysed in the 
confirmatory assay. Of the 147 samples analysed, 54 samples from 18 subjects were confirmed 
positive in the ADA confirmatory assay and further characterized for binding specificity and neutralizing 
activity. Of the 54 samples, 8 samples were positive for neutralizing antibodies; 3 samples from 3 
subjects were determined to be positive for neutralizing antibodies to Pelgraz; 4 samples from 2 
subjects were determined to be positive for neutralizing antibodies to G-CSF and 1 sample from 1 
subject was determined to be positive for neutralizing antibodies to both Pelgraz and G-CSF. The 
remaining 46 samples were negative for neutralizing antibodies.  
There was no apparent impact of ADA or neutralizing antibodies observed in this study on the 
pharmacodynamic activity of Pelgraz or Neulasta. In Cycle 1, presence of pre-existing antibodies had 
no negative impact on the ANC, Depth ANC Nadir and Duration of Severe Neutropenia measurements 
taken in the confirmed positive subjects. In Cycles 1-6, there was no correlation between the presence 
of detected ADA and failure to recover neutrophil counts. In addition, there were no apparent 
differences in ANC recovery between the ADA or neutralizing antibody positive subjects in the Pelgraz, 
US-Neulasta or EU-Neulasta groups.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in special populations have been conducted. In study Pelgraz-03, subgroup analysis of the 
primary efficacy endpoint, Duration of Severe Neutropenia (DSN) in Cycle 1, by age was conducted.  
In  the  study,  there  were  55  subjects  (9.3%)  with  age  at  baseline  between  65-74  years,  and  only 
3subjects  (0.5%)  with  age  above  74  years  at  baseline.  The  maximum  age  at  baseline  was  80  years. 
There were no subjects with age at baseline exceeding or equal to 85 years.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of this biosimilar application is based on study Pelgraz-03, which included patients 
undergoing adjuvant TAC therapy after surgical resection of breast cancer. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
No dedicated dose-finding studies or multiple-dose pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted 
with Pegylated Apo-Filgrastim. The dose and dosing regimen used in the phase 3 study (a fixed dose of 
6 mg, once per cycle) was selected based on the approved ones for US- and EU-Neulasta. This is 
considered acceptable, since mandatory dose-finding studies are not required for a biosimilar 
application. 
Main Study (Pelgraz-03) was a phase III, multicentre, randomized (2:1:1), active controlled, assessor-
blinded, safety and efficacy equivalence trial. The study included two active comparators, US-license 
Neulasta and EU-authorised Neulasta. The study was powered to demonstrate the equivalence of 
Pelgraz vs. each active comparator, as well as directly comparing both active comparators. The focus 
of this assessment is the demonstration of equivalence of Pelgraz vs. EU-Neulasta. 
Patients  were 
included 
if 
they  were 
to  undergo  adjuvant  TAC  (docetaxel,  doxorubicin, 
cyclophosphamide)  chemotherapy  for  stage  IIA,  IIB  or  IIIA  breast  cancer.  This  population  is 
considered  homogenous  in  terms  of  tumour  type,  planned  chemotherapy  and  disease  stage  (local-
regional,  non-metastatic  breast  cancer).  In  comparison  with  the  original  MAA  for  Neulasta-EU,  some 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 91/128 
 
 
 
 
 
  
small  differences  can  be  observed,  since  the  population  in  the  pivotal  trials  allowed  the  inclusion  of 
patient with more advanced disease (stage II/III/IV), and who could have received prior chemotherapy 
(either adjuvant therapy and/or no more than 1 regimen of chemotherapy for metastatic disease). 
Several populations were pre-defined for analyses: FAS (all randomised subject who received at least 
one dose of the active treatment; this population was the initially intended to be the main population 
for  analysis),  the  PP  (per-protocol,  patients  without  major  protocol  violations)  and  the  SAS  (safety 
population).  During  the  conduct  of  the  study,  53  subjects  (9.0%)  were  not  treated  as  per  the 
randomization scheme (referred to as ‘mixed dosing’ subjects). As a result, the FAS was re-defined as 
two  separate  subsets:  FAS-as  randomized  (original  FAS)  and  FAS-as  treated  (according  to  the 
treatment  actually  received).  All  pre-planned  analyses  were  conducted  with  both  FAS  populations 
subsets, as additional sensitivity analyses.  The main focus of this assessment are the results from the 
FAS-as  randomized  population,  which  closely  follow  the  ITT  principle  and  is  the  population  for  the 
primary  analysis.  Results  from  the  FAS-as  treated,  defined  post-hoc,  are  considered  informative  and 
are included as supportive. 
The  selected  primary  endpoint  was  the  duration  of  severe  neutropenia  (DSN)  in  Cycle  1,  defined  as 
ANC  below  0.5  x  109/L.  This  is  a  pharmacodynamic  endpoint,  closely  related  to  its  mechanism  of 
action. DSN was also the primary endpoint used in the pivotal studies of the original MAA for Neulasta-
EU and it was considered appropriate for peg-filgrastim by the CPMP7. 
The  secondary  endpoints  included  further  characterisation  of  ANC  in  cycle  1  (depth  and  peak  of  ANC 
nadir, time to the post nadir ANC recovery,  and ANC-time profile); grade 3-4 neutropenia (cycle 1); 
rate of FN (per cycle and across cycles);  mobilization of CD34+ cells (in a subset of patients, in cycle 
1);  frequency  and  type  of  (culture-confirmed)  infections;    incidence  of  IV  antibiotic  therapy  and 
hospitalization;  incidence,  severity  and  distribution  of  bone  pain;  occurrence  and/or  resolution  of 
chemotherapy-induced  mucositis  and  modifications  to  the  planned  chemotherapy  (%  of  scheduled 
chemotherapy  dose  delivered,  proportion  of  subjects  with  chemotherapy  doses  reduced,  omitted,  or 
delayed;  number  of  days  of  delay  of  chemotherapy).  Only  descriptive  analyses  were  initially  planned 
for the secondary endpoints. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 595 patients were included in the study, of which 589 were treated (294, and 148, 147 
randomised to Pelgraz, US-Neulasta and EU-Neulasta, respectively) and comprise the main population 
for analysis (FAS-as randomised).  
Demographic characteristics were fairly balanced, all patients were women and Caucasian. Elderly 
patients were underrepresented, since only 58 patients over the age of 65 were included in the study, 
only 3 of them were very elderly patients (> 75 years old) and the maximum age was 80 years of age.  
Regarding to baseline disease characteristics, all patients were chemotherapy naïve. A slightly higher 
proportion of patients in the Pelgraz group had stage IIa disease (43.9%, vs. 39.9% and 39.5% for the 
US- and EU-Neulasta, respectively), while stage IIIa was more frequent in the US-Neulasta group 
(33.1%, vs. Pelgraz and EU-neulasta, 29.3% and 30.6%, respectively).  
In general, the study population can be considered representative of a population with mostly local 
(non-metastatic) breast cancer.

The study met its primary objective, by demonstrating an equivalent efficacy of Pelgraz as compared 
to EU-approved Neulasta in terms of DSN. However, it failed to demonstrate equivalence of Pelgraz vs. 
US-Neulasta and the equivalence of both active comparator (US vs. EU Neulasta), since these results 
fell outside of the pre-defined 95%CIs. Considering that US- Neulasta was used in the PD pivotal study 
and that in the phase 3 study the comparability between both reference products (US-EU Neulasta) fell 
outside of the pre-defined 95%CI (i.e., ±0.5 days) for the primary endpoint, the clinical bridging was 
not considered convincing . The assessment of the new PK/PD study (154-14), provided additional 
clinical bridging by demonstrating the similarity between Pelgraz and EU-Neulasta. 
Regarding the secondary endpoints, only descriptive statistics were initially provided. In general, a few 
differences  were  observed  between  treatment  groups  in  terms  of  FN  rates,  CD34+  cells  mobilization, 
bone  pain  and  ANC  characteristics  in  cycle  1.  Most  of  these  differences  appear  to  be  small,  mostly 
numerical and in general, they tend to favour EU-neulasta. Likewise, a similar trend can be observed in 
some of the related endpoints in the safety section. As part of the responses to the CHMP´s D120 LoQ, 
the Applicant provided post hoc statistical analyses for these secondary endpoints, which showed that 
the differences were not statistically significant.  Although these results need to be taken with caution, 
they do not suggest that the differences are due to lack of efficacy. 
Regarding  the  subgroup  analyses  according  to  age,  the  study  failed  to  demonstrate  equivalence  of 
Pelgraz vs. either active comparator in the subgroup of patients >65 years old. The Applicant clarified 
that  the  study  was  not  formally  powered  for  this  subgroup  comparison.  This  limitation  is 
acknowledged.  
Regarding the potential impact of immunogenicity on efficacy and PD and considering the low incidence 
of  ADA  and  neutralizing  antibodies in  study  Pelgraz-03,  a  clinically  relevant  impact  on  efficacy  seems 
unlikely.  
The Applicant is requesting the only indication currently approved for EU-Neulasta (“Reduction in the 
duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy for malignancy [with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic 
syndromes”]). This indication was supported by pivotal studies conducted in patients with breast 
cancer, as it was considered a good model due to the high risk of neutropenia related to cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. It can be agreed that mode of action of pegfilgrastim is the same across patient 
populations receiving cytotoxic therapy for other solid cancers, and the effect of Pelgraz would be 
expected to be comparable. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Biosimilarity in efficacy of Pelgraz as compared to EU-approved Neulasta in terms of DSN has been 
demonstrated. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The data from the clinical studies, Pelgraz-02 (conducted in a healthy subject population) and Pelgraz-
03 (conducted in a breast cancer subject population) form the basis of the safety assessment of 
Pegylated Apo-Filgrastim.

Table 57 Summary of Exposure to Study Drug 
Study Pelgraz-02: Sixty- six (66) subjects were dosed in this study. 
A total of 57 subjects (27 for Pelgraz and 30 for US-Neulasta) received a total of 12 mg of 
pegfilgrastim exposure (cumulative dose); of which fifty-six (56) subjects (84.85%) completed both 
phases of the study.  
Healthy subjects in Pelgraz-02 were all adults (mean age 40.05 years, range 20-55 years). The 
majority were male (49 subjects, 74.24%), and most were White (39 subjects, 59.09%) with the 
remainder of subjects relatively equally distributed amongst the other racial groups (Black/African 
American: 10.61%, Asian: 9.09%, Multi-Racial: 10.61% and Aboriginal: 10.61%). The Pelgraz and US-
Neulasta subjects were well balanced between groups for demographic variables.  
Study Pelgraz-03: was a 3-arm, active controlled, study in which study drug was administered on 
day 2 following chemotherapy, for up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy treatment with maximal total 
cumulative pegfilgrastim exposures up to 36 mg. A total of 595 subjects were randomized, 589 were 
administered study drug, and 547 subjects completed the treatment phase of the study. Similar total 
numbers of subjects were exposed to Pelgraz, 294 subjects, as were exposed to the combined total of 
US-Neulasta (148 subjects) and EU-Neulasta (147 subjects) (295 subjects in the combined Neulasta 
arms). 
In APO- Peg-03, subjects were well balanced across the three treatment arms (Pelgraz, US- Neulasta 
and EU-Neulasta) for these demographic variables. All subjects enrolled in Pelgraz-03 were females 
and all were White. The age range of subjects in Pelgraz-03 was 22-80 years, with 58 out of 589 
subjects (9.8%) in Pelgraz-03 being geriatric subjects (≥ 65 years). Within each treatment arm in 
Pelgraz-03, the median body weight was similar; 73.0, 70.0, and 70.0 kg for Pelgraz, US-Neulasta, 
and EU-Neulasta, respectively.

Adverse events 
Healthy Subjects (Pelgraz-02)  
Of 66 (100%) randomized subjects, the number of subjects included in the safety analysis set was 60 
(90.91%) for Pelgraz and 63 (95.45%) for US-Neulasta. A similar total number of adverse events were 
documented for the two drugs, 369 events with Pelgraz and 386 with US- Neulasta. One subject (1 out 
of 63, 1.6%) taking US- Neulasta (Subject GC60) experienced a serious adverse event of 
hypersensitivity.

Table 59 Most Common Adverse Events from APO-Peg-02 with ≥5% Incidence 
White blood cell count increases were noted in 100% of subjects receiving test or reference drug 
product, regardless of study treatment period. While white blood cell count increase is a known and 
expected pharmacodynamic effect of pegfilgrastim, values outside of normal ranges were reported as 
AEs in Pelgraz-02. The white cell count AEs were mild in severity without any apparent difference 
between the Pelgraz and Neulasta treatment groups.  
White cell count decrease was also judged as mild in severity in 55.0% (33 out of 60 subjects) in the 
Pelgraz treatment group versus 47.6% (30 out of 63 subjects) in the Neulasta treatment group. One 
subject (GC58) (1.52%) in the Pelgraz group withdrew from the study due to white cell count 
increased adverse event.  
The incidence of bone pain was not unexpected as this is a known and well reported AE for Neulasta 
treatment (SmPC Neulasta; USPI Neulasta). The related bone pain AEs were mild to moderate in 
severity without any apparent difference in severity between the Pelgraz and Neulasta treatment 
groups. Bone pain was judged as mild in severity in 35 % (21 out of 60 subjects) in the Pelgraz 
treatment group versus 23.8 % (15 out of 63 subjects) in the Neulasta treatment group. Bone pain 
was judged as moderate in severity in 43.3% (26 out of 60 subjects) in the Pelgraz treatment group 
versus 50.8% (32 out of 63 subjects) in the Neulasta treatment group. No subject withdrew from the 
study due to a bone pain adverse event and the pain was controllable with non-narcotic analgesics.

Although the safety follow up phase did not have AEs that occurred with ≥ 5% incidence, the most 
common AEs that occurred in more than one subject were:  
bone pain was reported in 4 subjects (0.7%), 1 subject (0.4%) in Pelgraz and 3 subjects (2.1%) in 
US-Neulasta arms, respectively. Oedema peripheral was reported in 3 subjects (0.5%), 2 subjects 
(0.7%) in Pelgraz and 1 subject (0.7%) in US-Neulasta arms, respectively. Asthenia was reported in 2 
subjects (0.4%), 1 subject (0.4%) in Pelgraz and 1 subject (0.7%) in EU-Neulasta arms, respectively. 
Disease progression, paraesthesia and oropharyngeal pain were each reported in 2 subjects (0.4%), 1 
subject (0.4%) in Pelgraz and 1 subject (0.7%) in the US-Neulasta arms. All other events in the 
follow-up period were single occurrences.

Bone Pain  
Table 63 Summary of Bone Pain AEs in Treatment Period-SAS 
The proportions of subjects reporting bone pain of any intensity who received concomitant treatment 
for bone pain were similar across treatment arms: 26.2% (77 out of 294), 23.6%(35 out of 148) and 
29.3% (43 out of 147) for Pelgraz, US-Neulasta and EU-Neulasta arms,respectively (Fisher’s Exact 
test, p=0.547). These incidences were lower than the 75-79%reported in literature (Vogel et al., 
2005;Kubista et al., 2003), further supporting that the occurrence of bone pain and the intensity of 
bone pain reported were not masked by potential over-prescribing of pain medication. In Pelgraz-03 
study, the rates of bone pain events of any intensity that were treated with concomitant medication 
were also similar across the three treatment arms: 28.1% (308 out of 1095), 29.8% (159 out of 534) 
and 27.5% (150 out of 545) forPelgraz, US-Neulasta and EU-Neulasta, respectively.

Table 64 Injection Site Reactions 
Splenomegaly 
Splenomegaly is a known significant risk with G-CSFs such as filgrastim and pegfilgrastim and 
considered potentially lethal from splenic rupture. No such adverse event was reported during Pelgraz-
03, nor was splenomegaly detected by physical examination. 
The most common AE indicative of splenic rupture was abdominal pain upper. It was reported in 18 
(6.1%) subjects in the Pelgraz arm and 13 (8.8%) and 18 (12.2%) in the US- Neulasta and EU-
Neulasta arms, respectively. Out of the 127 reported abdominal pain upper AEs, none of them were 
associated with splenomegaly or splenic rupture.  
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) also is a reported significant, potentially lethal risk with 
filgrastim or pegfilgrastim medicinal products such as Neulasta. In Pelgraz-03, no respiratory events 
consistent with such toxicity were reported.  
Allergic Reactions  
Data for allergic reactions indicate that possible allergic reactions to Pelgraz are similar to those in 
Neulasta. Numerical differences in the overall incidence of these AEs were due to non-SAEs, mainly 
mild HS AE. The profile of AEs by preferred terms is within that known for these medicinal products, 
with no unexpected AEs and thus, no issues of particular concerns.  
Sickle Cell Disorder 
No subject with known sickle cell disorder was enrolled in the Pelgraz-03.

The overall incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher in Pelgraz treatment arm: 5.1% vs 4.7% vs 
2.7%, in US and EU Neulasta, respectively. A higher proportion of subjects had severe febrile 
neutropenia in the AI-Peg arm compared with Neulasta Us and Neulasta EU arms: 3.7%, 1.4% and 
2.7% as was incidence of SAEs of febrile neutropenia: 3.1%, 2%, 1.4%. Most of the cases occurred in 
Cycle 1, consistent with literature. There were no withdrawals due to this AEs.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were no deaths in Pelgraz-02.  
In the treatment period of Pelgraz-03, 1 out of 589 subjects (0.2%) died prior to dosing in cycle 4, due 
to progression of metastatic breast cancer. The subject was randomized to US-Neulasta arm, but 
received Pelgraz from Cycle 1 to 3.  The event was reported by the Investigator as not related to the 
study drug. In the safety follow-up period of Pelgraz-03, 2 out of 561 subjects (0.4%) died, 1 subject 
(RU06606) (0.4%) from the Pelgraz arm and 1 subject (BA03803) (0.7%) from the US-Neulasta arm 
due to disease progression.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
-Healthy Subjects (Pelgraz-02)  
1 in 66 subjects (1.5%) experienced an SAE that was reported in Period 1 where one subject taking 
US-Neulasta experienced a hypersensitivity reaction, which required hospital admission but resolved 
without sequelae. The SAE was moderate in severity and considered probably related to Neulasta.  
-Cancer Subjects (Pelgraz-03)  
In the treatment period, the incidence of SAEs was similar across the treatment arms. SAEs were 
reported for 4.8%, 3.4% and 4.1% of subjects in the Pelgraz, US-Neulasta and EU-Neulasta treatment 
arms, respectively. None of the SAEs were considered related (either  possibly, probably or definitely) 
to the study drug. One of the SAEs had a fatal outcome due to disease progression in the US-Neulasta 
arm (the same event was also reported as life threatening).  
Assessment report

The most common serious adverse event was febrile neutropenia. Fourteen (2.4%) cases were 
reported altogether, 9 (3.1%) in Pelgraz arm, 3 (2.0%) in US-Neulasta arm and 2 (1.4%) in the EU-
Neulasta arm, respectively. In the Pelgraz arm, the following additional SAEs occurred: 
thrombocytopenia, duodenal ulcer, vertebral fracture, cecum perforation, acute sinusitis, anaemia, 
pancytopenia and pulmonary embolism. Thrombocytopenia was assessed as definitely TAC related, its 
severity was moderate and it resolved without sequelae. All other SAEs can be associated with TAC 
chemotherapy or with the primary disease. In the US-Neulasta arm the following additional SAEs 
occurred: pneumonia and toxicoderma, and in the EU-Neulasta arm the following additional SAEs 
occurred: pneumonia, cholecystitis and acute pancreatitis. None of the SAEs were considered to be 
related to the study medication.  
In safety follow up period 6 SAEs were reported for 2 (0.7%) subjects in the Pelgraz arm and 4 (2.7%) 
in the US-Neulasta arm and 0% in EU Neulasta. Two of these SAEs were fatal. None of these events 
were related to the study drug.  
Laboratory findings 
-Healthy Subjects (Pelgraz-02)  
Abnormal laboratory events were common during the study, occurring in 61 subjects (92.42%) having 
abnormal laboratory results [44 subjects (66.67%) with abnormal laboratory results at Screening, 43 
subjects (65.15%) during Period 1, and 44 subjects (66.67%) during Period 2]. Laboratory 
abnormality results were not linked to a specific diagnosis.

Safety in special populations 
Table 69 Safety Profile by MedDRA Term and Subject Age (SAS-As Randomized population) 
For pegfilgrastim, while the pharmacokinetics are reported to have a high variability particularly in 
cancer patients (CPM Neulasta), various intrinsic factors such as age and gender are not reported to 
have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim, and hence its overall disposition and efficacy. 
Additionally, based on the available information in the literature, co- morbidities such as renal 
impairment and hepatic impairment are also not expected to have an effect on the disposition of 
pegfilgrastim as the clearance of pegfilgrastim is primarily mediated via neutrophils.

Additionally, considering the homogenous subject populations in study Pelgraz- 02 and Pelgraz-03, it 
would be difficult to clearly ascertain the impact of various intrinsic factors on the overall efficacy and 
safety profile of Pelgraz in comparison to Neulasta. An exploratory gender analysis was conducted for 
informational purposes only in Pelgraz-02, which included both male (74.24%) and female (25.76%) 
subjects. The results from this analysis reaffirmed the lack of expected gender effects on the 
disposition of pegfilgrastim.

Immunological events 
-Healthy Subjects (Pelgraz-02)  
A total of 10 samples from 6 subjects were confirmed positive in the ADA confirmatory assay and 
underwent further characterization for binding specificity and neutralizing activity. In Period 1, three 
subjects had detectable treatment emergent ADA after receiving Pelgraz in Period 1, representing an 
incidence of 9% (3 out of 33). Three subjects had detectable treatment emergent ADA after receiving 
US-Neulasta in Period 1, representing an incidence of 9% (3 out of 33). In Period 2 of this study, no 
additional subjects developed ADA and no ADA positive subjects had increased ADA titers. Two 
subjects became ADA negative; therefore, 4 subjects were positive for ADA at the end of Period 2.  
ADA has the potential to affect clinical safety by mediating hypersensitivity or other immune reactions 
or by affecting the activity of an endogenous counterpart. Therefore, the adverse event (AE) profiles of 
subjects with ADA were evaluated and compared to those of ADA negative subjects. Assessment of 
their adverse event profiles reveals no clinically significant differences in type of event, or severity, 
when compared to subjects that were ADA negative. In addition, adverse event profiles of the 6 
subjects with treatment emergent ADAs were not in keeping with clinical outcomes suggestive of 
immune mediated reactions. Only one subject experienced an SAE (hypersensitivity reaction) however 
all samples collected for this subject were ADA negative.  
In the healthy subject study population, ADA impact on AEs, as it relates to white blood cell (WBC) 
count, and more specifically ADA impact on neutrophilia, was evaluated. There were no differences 
between the frequency of WBC count AEs and neutrophilia in the ADA positive and negative 
populations. In addition, the frequency of these events was similar in subjects who developed ADA 
after exposure to Pelgraz and subjects who developed ADA after exposure to US-Neulasta.  
 -Cancer Patients (Pelgraz-03)  
In the study, 18 of 589 (3%) subjects assessed for immunogenicity were confirmed to be positive for 
ADA at one or more time point and were further assessed to characterize their ADA responses and 
their clinical impact. Pre-existing antibodies to pegfilgrastim were detected in a low percentage (2.2%) 
of the subjects (13/581) prior to their initial treatment in the study. Incidence of treatment-emergent 
induced ADA was low and highly similar between the three treatment groups: 1.0% (3/294) in the 
Pelgraz population, 0.7% (1/148) in the US-Neulasta population and 0.7% (1/147) in the EU-Neulasta 
population. In addition, ADA titers were low across all 3 treatment groups, and there was no pattern of 
increasing titers over time in the post-exposure period.  
Reactivity was primarily directed to the PEG moiety, although a few subjects had pre-existing or 
induced reactivity to the filgrastim moiety or to rhuGCSF.  
Neither Pelgraz nor Neulasta exposure resulted in the induction of neutralizing antibodies to Pegylated 
Apo-Filgrastim. Although pre-existing antibodies to pegfilgrastim were detected in a small number of 
subjects prior to treatment, none of these subjects remained positive following treatment and 
moreover, no subjects developed neutralizing antibodies to Pelgraz after exposure to any of the 3 
products.  
Neutralizing antibodies to GCSF were detected in 3 subjects. Two of these subjects were positive at the 
screen visit, of which one was negative at all post-dosing timepoints and one was only positive for anti-
GCSF neutralizing antibodies at one other time point (W20) although other time points were positive 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 109/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for ADA (Apo-Filgrastim and GCSF). The third subject (treated with Pelgraz) was positive for anti-GCSF 
neutralizing antibodies at two post-treatment time points. The GCSF neutralizing antibodies appeared 
to be transient and all 3 subjects were negative for neutralizing antibodies at their last time points 
tested.  
An assessment of AE profiles of subjects that were positive to ADA or GCSF neutralizing antibodies, 
showed that no anaphylaxis or other immunologically related AEs were reported. Overall the AEs 
reported are consistent with the subjects’ disease and treatment and were similar to those reported in 
the ADA negative subjects. There was no apparent relationship between the duration, timing, or 
specificity of ADA results and the AEs reported. In addition, there was no apparent differences in 
patterns of AEs reported for ADA confirmed positive subjects in the Pelgraz, US-Neulasta and EU-
Neulasta groups. With respect to the subjects who had GCSF neutralizing antibodies, one subject 
completed the study and had no reported AEs and the other 2 subjects were withdrawn from the study 
due to AE/SAE that were apparently unrelated to the presence of neutralizing antibodies.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies were performed with Pegylated Apo-Filgrastim. Similarly, no 
formal drug interaction studies between Neulasta and other drugs have been performed.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A relatively small number of subjects did not complete studies Pelgraz-02 (10 subjects, 15.15%) and 
Pelgraz-03 (42 subjects, 7.1%). Reasons for subject withdrawal are shown below.

Table 70 Subject Withdrawals by Study 
-Healthy Subjects (Pelgraz-02)  
Adverse events in these subjects leading to discontinuation included wrist fracture in 1 subject (1.5%), 
hypersensitivity in 1 subject (1.5%) (both occurred in Period 1) and those subjects had been 
administered US-Neulasta. One subject (1.5%) experienced increased white cell count, neutrophil 
count and lymphocyte count that occurred in Period 1. He had been administered Pegylated Apo-
Filgrastim.  
-Cancer Subjects (Pelgraz-03) – Treatment Phase  
Altogether 42 (7.1%) subjects were discontinued from the study during the treatment phase, 26 
(8.8%) in the Pelgraz arm, 6 (4.1%) in the US-Neulasta arm and 10 (6.8%) in EU-Neulasta arm. A 
summary of the reasons for the discontinuation of these subjects is provided below. 
The most common reason for study discontinuation was subject’s withdrawal of consent: thirteen 
(4.4%) subjects withdrew their consent in the Pelgraz treatment arm, 1 (0.7%) subject in the US-
Neulasta treatment arm and 4 (2.7 %) subjects in the EU-Neulasta treatment arm.  
During the Treatment Period in the Pelgraz arm, 7 (2.4%) subjects were withdrawn due to the 
following AEs: paresthesia, cecum perforation, disease progression (2 subjects), pancytopenia, 
pulmonary embolism, and ejection fraction decreased G3. Out of these AEs cecum perforation, 
pancytopenia and pulmonary embolism were assessed as serious. None of these events were 
considered related to IMP. In the US-Neulasta arm, 3 (2.0%) subjects were withdrawn due to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 111/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following AEs: left subclavian vein thrombosis, toxicoderma and redness, metastatic breast cancer. 
Of these events, the toxicoderma and metastatic breast cancer were assessed as serious, and the 
redness was considered possibly IMP-related. In the EU-Neulasta arm 2 (1.4%) subjects were 
withdrawn due to the following AEs: toxicoderma and sensory neuropathy. Neither was assessed 
as serious but the toxicoderma was assessed as probably related to IMP. 
– Safety Follow up Phase  
Altogether 53 (9.4%) subjects were discontinued from the study during the safety follow up phase, 28 
(10.2%) in the Pelgraz treatment arm, 14 (9.7%) in the US-Neulasta treatment arm and 11 (7.7%) in 
EU-Neulasta treatment arm. The most common reason for discontinuation in the safety follow up phase 
was subject’s withdrawal of consent: eighteen (6.6%) subjects withdrew their consent in the Pelgraz 
treatment arm, 8 (5.5%) subject in the US-Neulasta treatment arm and 4 (2.8 %) subjects in the EU-
Neulasta treatment arm.  
During the safety follow-up AEs leading to early withdrawal were reported for 3 (0.5%) subjects: 2 
subjects (0.7%) withdrew in the Pelgraz arm and one (0.7%) subject in the US-Neulasta arm. Thirteen 
subjects (2.3%) were lost to follow-up, 6 (2.2%) subjects in the Pelgraz treatment arm, 3 (2.1%) 
subject in the US-Neulasta treatment arm and 4 (2.8%) subjects in the EU- Neulasta treatment arm.  
Post marketing experience 
There is no post-marketing experience with Pelgraz. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The data from the clinical studies, Pelgraz-02 (conducted in a healthy subject population) and Pelgraz-
03 (conducted in a breast cancer subject population) form the basis of the safety assessment of 
Pegylated Apo-Filgrastim. Safety data from these two studies have not been integrated given the 
differences between studies.  
Patient exposure 
Study  Pelgraz-02  included  healthy  volunteers,  with  groups  balanced  with  respect  to  demographic 
characteristics. 
Study  Pelgraz-03  included  a  highly  selected  (homogeneous)  subset  of  white  women  with  early  Stage 
(IIA,  IIB  and  IIIA)  breast  cancer  and  receiving  TAC  (docetaxel,  doxorubicin,  cyclophosphamide) 
anticancer  chemotherapy  in  adjuvant  setting,  with  a  fairly  balanced  distribution  of  demographic  and 
patients characteristics across treatment arms. 
The studied populations are considered adequate for the comparability exercise.  
Adverse events  
-Study Pelgraz-02: 100% of subjects experienced at least 1 AEs on each study treatment. A similar 
total number of AEs were documented for the two drugs, 369 events with Pelgraz and 386 with US- 
Neulasta. All events were mild to moderate in severity and were similar between treatment groups, 
with slightly more moderate events for US-Neulasta (57/386 events, 14.7%) compared to Pelgraz 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 112/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(38/369 events, 10.1%). There were no severe AEs. There was only one SAE reported by 1 subject 
(1.6%) taking US- Neulasta (Subject GC60), who experienced a serious adverse event of 
hypersensitivity. Most of the AEs were considered possibly or probably related to study drug. 
A relatively small number of subjects did not complete Study Pelgraz-02 (10 subjects, 15.15%). Most 
subjects discontinued for reasons related to compliance in 4 subjects (6.1%). There were 3 subjects 
(4.6%) that withdrew due to adverse events. 
Overall, in Study Pelgraz-02, the distribution of common AEs was relatively similar after exposure to 
Pelgraz and US-Neulasta, and relatively similar in the two study periods. The most common AE 
reported in 66 subjects was increased white blood cell count (100%), followed by bone pain (83.3% 
subjects), and headache (66.7% subjects). The frequencies of the most common AEs for each 
treatment arm and for each study period (Period 1 or Period 2) were overall similar. 
No deaths occurred in Study 02. Only 1 SAE was reported: 1 HS reaction in the US Neulasta treated 
arm. 
There were no notable differences between Pelgraz and Neulasta with respect to change in laboratory 
parameters from screening to 672 hours in either period 1 or period 2. The maximum AST and ALT 
values were greater for the Pelgraz arm, as was the change from screening to 672 hours in both 
periods 1 and 2. It is argued that subject GC42, who had individual values at approximately 3x upper 
limit of normal (ULN) during Period 1 while taking Pegylated Apo-Filgrastim, is likely contributing to the 
noted differences. An analysis excluding these patients has been provided to support this statement. 
Changes in AST/ALT were observed in different direction, were mostly mild and do not raise any 
particular concern. 
It is noted that mean change from baseline in LDH at the end of period 2 was substantially higher for 
both treatment arms compared to the same analyses by the end of Period 1. In fact, mean change 
from baseline in period 1 was higher for Pelgraz vs Neulasta. These changes led to higher mean 
(minimum-maximum) values in the Pelgraz treatment arm. The magnitude of the mean change is not 
substantial.  The LDH incremental changes that were observed in both Pelgraz-02 and Pelgraz-03 
studies, which are well documented with the use of pegfilgrastim (Neulasta USPI), were transient 
laboratory findings that had no impact on the overall treatment course or safety of subjects receiving 
pegfilgrastim. 
-Study Pelgraz-03: A total of 265 subjects (90.1%) in the Pelgraz arm, 138 subjects (93.2%) in the 
US-Neulasta arm, and 136 subjects (92.5%) in the EU-Neulasta arm reported adverse events. Most 
events were mild (61.2% Pelgraz-arm,  62%  US Neulasta, 62.3% EU Neulasta) and to a lesser extent 
moderate (25.3%, 27.7%, 25.6% in APO-Pe-, US Neulasta and EU Neulasta, respectively) and severe 
(13.5%, 10.14%, 11.9% in APO-Pe-, US Neulasta and EU Neulasta, respectively) in all three groups. 
The proportion of subjects with SAEs was low: 14 (4.8%) subjects in Pelgraz, 5 (3.4%) subjects in US-
Neulasta and 6 (4.1%) subjects in EU-Neulasta treatment arms.  
Treatment was in general well tolerated, with the number of discontinuation being relatively low in all 
treatment arms: 26 (8.8%) in the Pelgraz arm, 6 (4.1%) in the US-Neulasta arm and 10 (6.8%) in EU-
Neulasta arm. The rate of treatment discontinuations during the treatment phase and the safety FU 
were numerically higher in the Pelgraz arm (8.8% and 10.2%, respectively) compared to the rates 
reported in the EU Neulasta treated arm (6.8% and 7.7%, respectively). These differences are mainly 
driven by a higher rate of discontinuations due to withdrawal of consent in the Pelgraz treated arm, but 
these could not be attributed to lack of efficacy or particular safety issues. The overall incidence of 
discontinuations due to AEs was low with no major differences across study arms, both during 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 113/128 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment phase (2.4%, 2% and 1.4% in Pelgraz, US Neulasta, and EU Neulasta, respectively) and the 
safety follow-up (0.7% in each treatment arm).  
During the safety follow-up period, the overall incidence of AEs was low in all treatment arms: 4.4% 
Pelgraz arm, 7.6% US Neulasta, 2.8% EU Neulasta, mostly mild AEs. SAEs were reported in 2 (0.7%) 
subjects in the Pelgraz arm and 4 (2.8%) subjects in the US-Neulasta arm and 0 subjects in EU 
Neulasta. Two of the 6 SAEs had fatal outcome [1 (0.4%) in the Pelgraz arm, and 1 (0.7%) in the US-
Neulasta arm]. None of these events were related to the study drug. No SAEs were reported in the EU 
Neulasta treated arm during this FU-period. Withdrawals due to AEs were rare and similar across study 
arms: 0.7% Pelgraz, 0.7% US Neulasta, 0.7% EU Neulasta.  
Some numerical differences in the overall incidence of AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, seriousness of 
AEs, SAEs, life threatening and fatal events, both during the treatment phase and the safety FU period 
are observed between EU-Neulasta and Pelgraz treatment arms. Differences are rather modest and of 
doubtful relevance. Most of the AEs driving these results are related to the underlying condition and/or 
the concomitant chemotherapy.  
The occurrence of the three most common AEs (neutropenia, bone pain and nausea) was similar in all 
the three treatment arms. For neutropenia: 50.7%, 57.4% and 52.4% in Pelgraz, US-Neulasta and EU-
Neulasta, respectively. For bone pain: 47.3%, 49.3% and 53.1% in Pelgraz, US-Neulasta and EU-
Neulasta, respectively. For nausea: 46.9%, 45.3% and 49.0% in Pelgraz, US- Neulasta and EU-
Neulasta, respectively. Other frequent AEs for which a difference >5% between Pelgraz arm and EU 
Neulasta was found include: leukopenia (21.1% vs 27.9%), thrombocytopenia (4.1% vs 10.9%), 
abdominal pain upper (6.1% vs 12.2%), fatigue (14.6% vs 21.8%), pyrexia (7.1% vs 14.3%), 
decrease appetite (4.1% vs 11.6%). The overall incidence of cytopenic disorders and GI disorders 
tended to be higher in the EU Neulasta treatment arm as compared to the Pelgraz-arm. These are 
known AEs of the concomitant QT, and no explanation is given for these differences. In the safety 
follow up phase, there were no AEs that occurred with ≥ 5% incidence.  
Deaths and other SAEs: During the pivotal study, 3 deaths occurred, 1 during the treatment phase and 
2 during the safety FU. In all cases these were not considered related to study treatment but the 
disease progression.  
The total number of SAEs was 32. SAEs were reported for 4.8%, 3.4% and 4.1% of subjects in the 
Pelgraz, US-Neulasta and EU-Neulasta treatment arms, respectively. One of the SAEs had a fatal 
outcome due to disease progression in the US-Neulasta arm (the same event was also reported as life 
threatening). The most common serious adverse event was febrile neutropenia: 9 (3.1%) in Pelgraz 
arm, 3 (2.0%) in US-Neulasta arm and 2 (1.4%) in the EU-Neulasta arm, respectively. Other SAEs 
reported across the treatment groups appear more related to the underlying condition and/or to 
chemotherapy, i.e. thrombocytopenia, anemia, pulmonary embolism. In the safety follow up period 6 
SAEs were reported for 2 (0.7%) subjects in the Pelgraz arm and 4 (2.7%) in the US-Neulasta arm, 
apparently not related to study drug toxicity.  
AESI (only assessed in the Study Pelgraz-03):  
-The overall incidence of bone pain and related AEswas slightly lower in the Pelgraz treated arm 
compared to the EU Neulasta (bone pain 47.3% vs 53.1%, respectively, all PTs 53.1% vs 59.9%, 
respectively). By contrary, the incidence of severe bone pain AEs was slightly higher in Pelgraz (15.6% 
vs 13.6%). The slightly higher incidence of severe bone pain in Pelgraz arm when compared with EU-
Neulasta arm could be due to chance and are not considered relevant based on the totality of the 
safety data. In addition it was observed that none of the cases of bone pain were reported as an SAE, 
nor led to discontinuation from the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/595848/2018  
Page 114/128 
 
 
 
 
 
-ISR was reported in 17 (5.8%) subjects in Pelgraz arm, in 7 (4.7%) subjects in US-Neulasta arm and 
in 9 (6.1%) subjects in EU-Neulasta arm. Only one severe AEs was reported in US Neulasta. No 
discontinuations were reported.  
-Splenomegaly and splenic rupture are known significant risks with G-CSFs such as filgrastim and 
pegfilgrastim. No such adverse event was reported during Pelgraz-03, nor was splenomegaly detected 
by physical examination. The most common AE indicative of splenic rupture was abdominal pain upper. 
It was reported in 18 (6.1%) subjects in the Pelgraz arm and 13 (8.8%) and 18 (12.2%) in the US- 
Neulasta and EU-Neulasta arms, respectively. All 26 events of moderate and severe upper abdominal 
pain were related to gastric pain, epigastric pain, stomach pain or stomach ache, asper the 
investigator’s clinical judgment. None of the cases were judged to be related to splenomegaly or 
splenic rupture. In addition, none of the events of upper abdominal pain were considered as SAEs, nor 
led to withdrawal of study treatment, and all of the events resolved by the end of the study (18 out of 
26 events were treated with concomitant medications while the remaining 8 events resolved without 
intervention. Further investigations were not conducted in any of the cases. While the presence of 
splenomegalia in some of these cases cannot be totally ruled out, the fact that all of them resolved 
(with or without treatment) and that none of them were considered SAEs is reassuring.  
-No Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) events consistent with such a toxicity were reported. 
The most common AE indicative of ARDS was pneumonia, reported in 1 subject (0.3%) in the Pelgraz 
arm, 1 subject (0.7%) and 2 subjects (1.4%) in the US-Neulasta and EU-Neulasta arms, respectively. 
Two of these cases were considered serious, one each in the US-Neulasta and EU-Neulasta arms. 
-Data for allergic reactions indicate that possible allergic reactions to Pelgraz are similar to those seen 
in EU-Neulasta. 
-The overall incidence of febrile neutropenia, serious and severe febrile neutropenia were numerically 
higher in Pelgraz treatment arm: overall incidence 5.1% vs 4.7% vs 2.7%, in US and EU Neulasta, 
respectively, severe febrile neutropenia in the AI-Peg arm compared with Neulasta Us and Neulasta EU 
arms: 3.7%, 1.4% and 2.7% ; SAEs of febrile neutropenia: 3.1%, 2%, 1.4%. These were numerical 
differences of doubtful clinically relevance.  
Laboratory changes: 
The frequency of abnormal, clinically significant laboratory results was similar across treatment arms.  
Overall out of range (abnormal), clinically significant laboratory parameters were recorded in 49.7% of 
subjects in the Pelgraz arm, 52.0% in the US-Neulasta arm and 52.4% in the EU- Neulasta arm. Most 
commonly the clinically significant abnormalities were in neutrophils (45.6%, 48.6% and 49.0%), 
leukocytes (22.4%, 29.1% and 32.0%) and platelets (4.8%, 4.1% and 9.5%) as would be expected in 
this patient population undergoing chemotherapy. 
Overall, shifts to below normal range at W20 in neutrophils were similar between treatment arms. It is 
noted that the proportion of patients with shifts to below normal range in Hb values at W20 was higher 
in EU Neulasta (36.7%) compared to Pelgraz and US Neulasta treated arms (23% and 22.3%, 
respectively).

-In Study Pelgraz-02: a total of 6 subjects were confirmed ADA positive by the end of Period 1 (3 in 
each study treatment, representing an incidence of 9%).  In Period 2 of this study, no additional 
subjects developed ADA and no ADA positive subjects had increased ADA titers. Two subjects became 
ADA negative; therefore, 4 subjects were positive for ADA at the end of Period 2. Subjects who were 
confirmed ADA positive had no clinical outcomes suggestive of immune mediated reactions, and hence 
ADA development was not correlated with any clinical safety concerns in this Study. Overall, no 
apparent difference was noted between treatment groups for the total number of AEs, severity, 
relationship to study drug, interventions, incidence rate and SOC of the most common AEs and 
immunogenicity results.  
-In Study Pelgraz-03: 18 of 589 (3%) subjects assessed for immunogenicity were confirmed to be 
positive for ADA at one or more time point. Of them, 2.2% were ADA + at screening. Incidence of 
treatment-emergent induced ADA was low and highly similar between the three treatment groups: 
1.0% (3/294) in the Pelgraz population, 0.7% (1/148) in the US-Neulasta population and 0.7% 
(1/147) in the EU-Neulasta population. The incidence of immunogenicity was low and highly similar 
across products. In addition, there were no apparent clinically meaningful effects associated with either 
pre-existing antibodies or induced ADA or NAb in these studies and no clinically meaningful differences 
between the immunogenic responses to Pelgraz and Neulasta. The Applicant concludes that an 
assessment of AE profiles of subjects that were positive to ADA or GCSF neutralizing antibodies, 
showed that no anaphylaxis or other immunologically related AEs were reported, which is reassuring. 
Overall the AEs reported are consistent with the subjects’ disease and treatment and were similar to 
those reported in the ADA negative subjects. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A relatively small number of subjects did not complete studies Pelgraz-02 (10 subjects, 15.15%) and 
Pelgraz-03 (42 subjects, 7.1%). 
Overall, the rate of treatment discontinuations in the pivotal study was higher in the Pelgraz arm, 
8.8% and 10.2% during the treatment phase and the safety follow up, respectively, compared to the 
rates reported in the EU Neulasta treated arm (6.8% and 7.7%, respectively). The Pelgraz arm had a 
higher incidence of premature discontinuation due to consent withdrawal (4.4%) and due to AEs 
(1.7%) in FAS-As Randomized; discontinuations due to other reasons were balanced among treatment 
arms. After conduction of an in depth analysis of these cases, it was concluded that these cannot be 
attributed to the lack of efficacy or to a particular safety concern related to Pelgraz. Differences in 
discontinuation rate among treatment arms were numerical but not statistically significant (Fisher’s 
exact test, p=0.181). Based on these analyses, it can be concluded that these numerical differences 
were most likely due to chance. 
Based on the comparative data presented, Pelgraz demonstrated a safety profile that was similar as 
compared to each of the commercially available US-licensed and EU-approved Neulasta.  
Overall, adverse reactions reported in the studies were in line with the known safety profile of 
Neulasta, as described in its SmPC. The safety information of Pelgraz SmPC is fully aligned with the 
Neulasta SmPC. The list of safety concerns of the RMP of Pelgraz is also fully aligned with the one of 
Neulasta. 
In addition, findings confirmed the low immunogenic potential of Pelgraz and support the biosimilarity 
of Pelgraz and Neulasta

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Pelgraz displayed a similar safety profile to Neulasta with no unexpected or significant safety findings. 
The safety profile of Pelgraz was consistent with the well-characterized mode-of-action of 
pegfilgrastim. There were no clinically relevant differences in the incidence, frequency, or duration of 
TEAEs between Pelgraz and Neulasta.  
The available safety data support biosimilarity between Pelgraz and Neulasta.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
The indications claimed are as for the reference product (Neulasta): 
Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients 
treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia 
and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
A pre-submission meeting was held with EMA on January 15th, 2015 for Apotex to present an overview 
of the content of the proposed MAA for Pelgraz as a proposed biosimilar to Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) 
and receive feedback from the EMA on Apotex’s readiness to proceed with the MAA filing for Pegylated 
Apo-Filgrastim.  
As part of the global development program, Pelgraz has been developed as a proposed biosimilar to 
both the EU-approved and US-licensed Neulasta. Consistent with relevant guidances which were 
current at the time of product development, as follows:

3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
Several biosimilarity studies conducted show comparability between the proposed biosimilar, Pegylated 
Apo-Filgrastim, and EU-approved and US-licensed Neulasta (the reference medicinal product), using a 
variety of test methods to confirm identity, structural features and biological activity. Results from the 
comparison of several batches derived from the commercial process of Pelgraz and several batches of 
Neulasta do not show significant differences that could have an impact on the comparability of the 
efficacy and safety profile. However, due to the limited number of batches used for the comparison 
concerns were raised regarding the representativeness of those batches to reflect the actual variability 
of both the biosimilar and the reference medicinal product and, therefore, the basis to establish 
biosimilarity from quality comparability studies was questionned. This was considered a critical point 
since some of the non-clinical and clinical studies have only been conducted with RMP derived from a 
non-EU source. Further, the Applicant provided results of new biosimilarity studies that resolve these 
concerns. 
Non-clinical 
The non-clinical overall data indicate that Pelgraz can be considered similar to the reference product 
Neulasta. 
Clinical 
The Applicant followed a stepwise approach to demonstrate similarity between Pelgraz and Neulasta, 
which consists of a phase 1 PK/PD study in healthy volunteers and a phase 3 study in breast cancer 
patients. Additional support derives from a new PK/PD study (154-14) was provided.  
In the single dose PK/PD trial in healthy volunteers (Pelgraz-02) provided with the original submission, 
the PK/PD analyses revealed biosimilarity between the product and (US-labeled) Neulasta. Study 154-
14 provided additional evidence on similarity between the product and EU-Neulasta. 
In the phase 3 study, although the equivalence of Pelgraz vs. EU-Neulasta was demonstrated in terms 
of DSN (primary endpoint), the results of some of the secondary endpoints do not point in the same 
direction. Additional data provided by the Applicant do not suggest that these differences could be due 
to lack of efficacy.  
Overall, comparable safety profiles of Pelgraz and US-Neulasta or EU-Neulasta were demonstrated in 
the Study conducted in early stage breast cancer subjects and of Pelgraz and US Neulasta in the

healthy volunteers Study. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations that have an impact on the conclusion of 
biosimilarity. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
The clinical study submitted met its primary objective, by demonstrating an equivalent efficacy of 
Pelgraz as compared to EU-approved Neulasta in terms of DSN.  
Descriptive statistics regarding the secondary endpoints, showed a few and small differences between 
treatment groups in terms of FN rates, CD34+ cells mobilization, bone pain and ANC characteristics in 
cycle 1, which do not suggest impact on efficacy. Regarding the potential impact of immunogenicity on 
efficacy and PD and considering the low incidence of ADA and neutralizing antibodies in study Pelgraz-
03, a clinically relevant impact on efficacy or safety seems unlikely.  
The claimed indication was supported by pivotal studies conducted in patients with breast cancer, as it 
was considered a good model due to the high risk of neutropenia related to cytotoxic chemotherapy. It 
can  be  agreed  that  mode  of  action  of  pegfilgrastim  is  the  same  across  patient  populations  receiving 
cytotoxic therapy for other solid cancers, therefore the effect of Pelgraz in reduction of neutropenia is 
independent of the oncology condition under treatment. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The Applicant is requesting the only indication currently approved for EU-Neulasta (“Reduction in the 
duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy for malignancy [with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic 
syndromes”]). Therefore no extrapolation to other indications is discussed. 
3.6.  Additional considerations  
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Pelgraz is considered biosimilar to Neulasta. Therefore, a

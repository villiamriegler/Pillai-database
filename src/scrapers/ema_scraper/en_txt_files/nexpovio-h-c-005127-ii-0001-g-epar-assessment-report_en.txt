Group of variations including an extension of indication for Nexpovio in combination with bortezomib 
and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at 
least one prior therapy and a quality variation for the addition of a new pack size (8 tablets) to align 
with the dose modification guidance for the new indication. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 
6.5 of the SmPC are updated to reflect the new indication and the new pack size. In addition, the Type 
II variation is intended to fulfil the Specific Obligation agreed in the context of the Conditional 
Marketing Authorisation (CMA) of Nexpovio via the submission of results from the confirmatory Phase 
3 study, KCP-330-023. Annex II is updated to reflect the completion of this Specific Obligation. The 
Labelling and Package Leaflet are amended accordingly. The RMP (v 1.1) is amended consequently. 
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0384/2018 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver. 
The  Paediatric  Committee,  having  assessed  the  waiver  application  in  accordance  with  Article  13  of 
Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006  as  amended,  recommended  to  grant  a  product-specific  waiver  for  all 
subsets of the paediatric population in accordance with Article ll(l)(c) of said Regulation, on the grounds 
that  the  specific  medicinal  product  does  not  represent  a  significant  therapeutic  benefit  over  existing 
treatments for paediatric patients. The paediatric investigation plan waiver was granted for selinexor as 
a treatment of MM as of 6 December 2020. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the application included a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products.  
Scientific advice 
The MAH sought scientific advice from the CHMP in September 2016 regarding the design of the global

phase 3 BOSTON study. Questions pertained to (key) study design features including the proposed 
patient population, selected dose regimens for the experimental and control arms, primary and 
secondary endpoints, PROs and statistical aspects (including sample size assumptions and planned 
interim analyses). A question regarding the safety database expected at the time of submission was 
also included as well as a question regarding regulatory options for approval. According to the MAH the 
protocol was modified to incorporate the feedback received from the CHMP.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell disorder that is characterized by the production of 
monoclonal immunoglobulin in a majority of patients and that invades adjacent bone tissue. Common 
manifestations include bone pain, renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, anaemia, and recurrent 
infections. 
Multiple myeloma is characterized by osteolytic lesions, usually in the pelvis, spine, ribs, and skull. 
Lesions are caused by expanding plasmacytomas or by cytokines secreted by myeloma cells that 
activate osteoclasts and suppress osteoblasts. Increased bone loss may also lead to hypercalcemia. 
Solitary extraosseous plasmacytomas are unusual but may occur in any tissue, especially in the upper 
respiratory tract. In many patients, renal failure is present at diagnosis or develops during the course 
of the disorder and is caused by the deposition of light chains in the distal tubules or by hypercalcemia. 
Patients also often develop anaemia due to kidney disease or suppression of erythropoiesis by cancer 
cells, but sometimes also due to iron deficiency. These signs and symptoms are commonly denoted as 
CRAB. 
Claimed therapeutic indication 
NEXPOVIO (selinexor) in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult 
patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
MM is a rare and incurable plasma cell neoplasm which typically affects adults mostly over 60 years of 
age. The median age at diagnosis is 65–70 years; only 2% of patients are younger than 40 years 
(Raab 2009). 
Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for 1%-1.8% of all cancers and is the second most common 
haematological malignancy (after non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [NHL]) with an estimated incidence in 
Europe of 4.5-6.0/100 000/year, with approximately 176.404 new MM cases and 117,077 deaths due 
to MM anticipated in 2020 worldwide (The Global Cancer Observatory 2020).  
The treatment of MM has notably progressed with the availability of new drugs and its combinations, 
such way that survival of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma has increased from 
approximately 3 years in the years 1985 to 1998 (Kyle 2003) to 6 to 10 years (Moreau 2015) along 
the last 15 years. Despite the significant improvement in patients’ survival over the past 20 years, only 
10%-15% of patients achieve or exceed expected survival compared with the matched general 
population.

Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
As  previously  described,  MM  is  characterized  by  the  increased  proliferation  of  malignant  monoclonal 
plasma cells in the bone marrow, with the subsequent bone marrow failure due to replacement of normal 
bone  marrow  haematopoiesis,  the  over-production  of  monoclonal  immunoglobulins  (M-protein,  either 
intact immunoglobulins and/or free light chains [FLC]) which could be detected in the serum or urine, 
and  finally  the  presence  of  systemic  symptoms  named  as  CRAB  (hyperCalcemia,  Renal  impairment, 
Anaemia  and  Bone  lesions).  Increased  susceptibility  to  infections  (immunoparesis)  and  neurological 
complications are also present (Palumbo 2011). 
Based on karyotype, MM is classified as non-hyperdiploid and hyperdiploid, with the latter accounting 
for  50%  to  60%  of  cases  and  characterized  by  trisomies  in  odd-numbered  chromosomes.  MM  has  a 
heterogeneous  progression  pathway,  with  multiple  relapses  over  time,  whereby  several  MM  cell 
subclones coexist at baseline and compete for dominance over time, leading to the evolution of drug-
resistance clones [Laubach, 2014].  
Drug  resistance  to  prior  regimens  in  patients  with  relapsed/refractory  (RR)  MM  is  due  to  continuous 
changes in the disease biology, in which a higher proportion of malignant cells are expressing a more 
aggressive, highly proliferative phenotype over time (Anderson, 2008).  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The most common symptoms in MM patients include persistent skeletal pain, pathological fractures and 
vertebral  collapse,  anaemia,  renal  impairment,  hypercalcaemia  and  recurrent  or  persistent  bacterial 
infections. Approximately 20% of patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. 
The most common criteria used in diagnosis of symptomatic MM is the presence of neoplastic plasma 
cells  comprising  more  than  10%  of  BM  cells  or  the  presence  of  plasmacytomas,  together  with  a 
monoclonal paraprotein (M-protein) in the serum and/or urine and the evidence of related organ or tissue 
impairment due to clonal plasma cell hyper-proliferation. 
The International Staging System (ISS) is used for prognosis and it was revised by The International 
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) including cytogenetics by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, Revised International Staging System for Multiple Myeloma, R-ISS), and 
is now widely accepted (Palumbo, 2015). At the time of diagnosis, patients are categorized according to 
R-ISS, their age, comorbidity and their suitability for intensive treatment. 
Despite  advance  in  therapy,  MM  remains  incurable.  All  patients  eventually  relapse  and  with  each 
successive relapse, the chance of response and duration of response typically decreases and ultimately 
the disease becomes refractory and results in cumulative end organ damage (e.g., renal, cytopenias, 
infections and bone complications). 
Management 
Current treatment of MM includes glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone), 
chemotherapy,  primarily  alkylating  agents,  including  high  dose  chemotherapy  followed  by  autologous 
stem  cell  transplantation  (ASCT),  proteasome  inhibitors  (PIs,  such  as  bortezomib,  carfilzomib  and 
ixazomib),  immunomodulatory  agents  (such  as  thalidomide,  lenalidomide  and  pomalidomide), 
monoclonal  antibodies  (mAbs,  such  as  daratumumab,  isatuximab  and  elotuzumab)  and  the  histone 
deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. 
The choice of therapy in the relapse setting depends on several parameters such as age, performance 
status, comorbidities, the type, efficacy and tolerance of the previous treatment, the number of prior 
treatment lines, the available remaining treatment options, the interval since the last therapy and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/620277/2022  
Page 9/151 
 
 
 
type of relapse (i.e. clinical versus biochemical relapse; in the case of biochemical relapse, treatment 
can be delayed). 
At  the  time  of  first  relapse  and  beyond,  lenalidomide  in  combination  with  dexamethasone  and 
bortezomib, either alone as single-agent or in combination with PEGylated doxorubicin were the available 
approved  options  until  2015.  Bortezomib  is  mostly  used  in  combination  with  dexamethasone  in  the 
relapse setting. 
Panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, is now indicated for the treatment of 
patients  with  RR  MM  who  have  received  at  least  two  prior  regimens  including  bortezomib  and  an 
immunomodulatory  agent.  Carfilzomib  has  also  been  approved  in  combination  with  lenalidomide  and 
dexamethasone and also in combination with dexamethasone alone in patients with at least one line of 
prior therapy. That is also the case of elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
and ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, all in patients who have received 
at least one prior line of therapy. 
In  very  advanced-stage  disease,  pomalidomide  in  combination  with  low-dose  dexamethasone,  is 
approved  in  patients  who  have  received  at  least  two  prior therapies,  including  both  lenalidomide  and 
bortezomib, and whose disease progressed after treatment with these medicines.  
In young patients, a second ASCT may be considered, provided that the patient responded well to the 
previous ASCT and had a PFS of more than 24 months. In the relapse setting, allogeneic SCT should 
only be carried out in the context of a clinical trial. Therapies with a multimodal MoA, which target MM 
cells and elicit an immunogenic response, as well as drugs with new mechanisms of action, are expected 
to minimize the development of drug resistance in MM and/or increase disease response to therapy. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Selinexor (KPT-330) is an oral, slowly reversible covalent, selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) 
compound  that  specifically  blocks  the  nuclear  export  protein  1  (XPO1.)  XPO1  is  responsible  for  the 
unidirectional export of ~220 different cargo proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Garg 2017, Xu 
2010, Xu 2012). The anti-neoplastic activity of SINE compounds is mediated through at least 3 distinct 
pathways involving tumour suppressor proteins (TSPs), oncoproteins, and the glucocorticoid receptor. 
Selinexor synergizes with PIs such as bortezomib (Turner 2013, Turner 2016, Tai 2014, Wu 2016) and 
carfilzomib (Kandarpa 2013, Rosebeck 2016) leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of 
MM cell death. 
The  European  Medicines  Agency's  (EMA)  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP) 
adopted a positive opinion for the conditional marketing authorization (CMA) for NEXPOVIO (selinexor) 
in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of MM in adult patients who have received at least 
4  prior  therapies  and  whose  disease  is  refractory  to  at  least  2  proteasome  inhibitors,  2 
immunomodulatory agents and an anti-CD38 MoA, and who have demonstrated disease progression on 
the last therapy (EPAR EMA/CHMP/95252/2021; 27/052021). 
Nexpovio received a conditional marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU on 26 March 2021. 
Selinexor  was  originally  designated  as  an  Orphan  Medicinal  Product  in  the  European  Union  on  19 
November  2014  -  EU/3/14/1355.  This  product  was  withdrawn  from  the  Union  Register  of  orphan 
medicinal  products  by  the  European  Commission  in  February  2021  upon  request  of  the  marketing 
authorisation holder at the time of the granting of a marketing authorisation. This product is no longer 
an orphan medicine.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The Applicant sought scientific advice from the CHMP in September 2016 regarding the design of the 
global phase 3 BOSTON study, see section 1.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The MAH states that study KCP-330-023 (BOSTON) was designed, implemented, and reported in 
accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), with the 
applicable local regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC and United States [US] Code of 
Federal Regulations Title 21), and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
At the time of initial MAA, a routine GCP inspection was requested by the CHMP. Two investigator sites 
in Greece and USA and the sponsor site in USA were inspected in March 2019. Several critical and 
major findings were detected which were system and process related. 
“A GCP system inspection of the sponsor is necessary to confirm that those critical aspects found 
during this inspection are not repeated in other trials where Karyopharm is the sponsor.” 
Taking the above into account, it was considered justified to request a GCP inspection. One 
investigator site (in Barcelona, Spain) and the sponsor site (in Boston, US) were inspected on 
December 2021 and January 2022, respectively. The final Integrated Inspection Report (IIR) was 
made available on 17th March 2022. During this second GCP inspection it was concluded that even 
though significant improvements had been implemented since the previous EMA inspection there was 
still room for improvement in the quality management system of the Sponsor. Several critical findings 
were identified during the inspection. These aspects were satisfactorily addressed by the MAH during 
the procedure (see efficacy discussion).   
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
The MAH submitted only new data related to the environmental risk assessment (ERA) for selinexor. 
No additional non-clinical information (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics or toxicology) was submited. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted information for ERA of selinexor in accordance with EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 
Corr 2 guidance. This information would not modify the current SmPC.

N/A 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has presented data for the phase I assessment of ERA (log Kow and PECsw). 
Persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity 
LogKow  (LogP  at  neutral Ph  7.0)  of  selinexor  was measured by  the  shake-flask  method  (OECD  107). 
Prediction of Log P value was made using ACD/Labs software v12.5.  
The experimental LogP of selinexor at neutral pH was 3.73 (predicted: 2.9). 
Both  predicted  and  measured  LogKow  of  selinexor  is  <  4.5  so  that  screening  for  persistence, 
bioaccumulation and toxicity is not required. 
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
PEC value was estimated in line with the formula provided in the ERA guideline. For selinexor, the 
following assumptions were made: 
DOSEai = 100 mg /7 = 14.3 mg/day (calculated from the dose of 100 mg to be administered once 
weekly) 
Fpen = 1.8/10,000 (=prevalence of plasma cell myeloma in the EU), 
WASTEWinhab = 200 l/(inhabitant x day), the default value recommended in the guideline, 
DILUTION = 10, the default value recommended in the guideline. 
The PECsurfacewater of selinexor is 0.00129 μg/L and thus below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. A 
phase II for selinexor would not be required. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Selinexor PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, selinexor is not expected to pose a risk for environment. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, selinexor is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Analytical methods 
Bortezomib Matrix Lot-Dependent Stability Investigation 
Covance Study Number 8413-691 
To analyze bortezomib plasma samples from clinical study KPT-330-023, development and validation 
of a method to analyze bortezeomib in human plasma (K2EDTA) was performed under Covance study 
number 8413-691. During method development, it was determined that bortezomib is not stable when 
stored at -70 ºC or -20 ºC in selected lots of K2EDTA human plasma or Na-Heparin human plasma. 
Based on the method development data, it was determined that pretreatment of samples with formic 
acid (2%) is essential to stabilize bortezomib. Details of the stability experiments and results are 
summarized in this report. 
The bortezomib instability was observed in accuracy and precision tests. When a previously qualified 
QC batch was re-tested (with curves prepared on the day of extraction in a later run) after having 
been stored at -20 ºC, the result failed to meet acceptance criteria due to low bias. 
A summary of the investigation is presented in the table below. 
To test whether the instability was caused by storage conditions 
The result shows that the QC’s and curves that were prepared on the day of run 17 extraction met the 
acceptance criteria. All the QC’s qualified in run 12 and run 16 failed to meet acceptance criteria except 
for MQC 16. QC 13 is further biased low comparing to QC16. These results demonstrate that 
bortezomib is unstable in human plasma K2EDTA. However, the failure of QCs was not due to storage 
conditions (-20 °C or -70 °C) of the samples.

To test Bortezomib stability in untreated and treated pooled human plasma K2EDTA or Na Heparin 
Human plasma K2EDTA and human plasma Na-Heparin were treated with Formic Acid (2% FA in 
human plasma) to alter matrix pH value or heated in 50 ºC for two hours to inhibit possible enzyme 
activity. HQC and LQC were prepared in these matrixes to test Bortezomib stability. After having been 
qualified in each matrix, the fresh prepared HQC and LQC were aliquoted to be stored at -70 ºC, -20 
ºC, on ice and at room temperature. These samples were tested on a later day with a second set of 
HQC/LQC freshly spiked and processed in the same quantification runs. 
The results demonstrated in untreated human plasma Na-Heparin, bortezomib degraded the same way 
as in human plasma K2EDTA in previous runs. Heat treatment did not stabilize bortezomib. However, 
when the matrix was treated with final FA content of 2%, the stability was greatly improved compared 
to the untreated: in human plasma Na-Heparin containing 2% FA, both QC aliquot stored at -20 ºC 
and -70 ºC met the acceptance criteria, but not the ones stored at 5 ºC or room temperature. 
In human plasma K2EDTA, the HQC and LQC met the acceptance criteria after been stored at -20 ºC or 
-70 ºC, which is inconsistent with earlier observation. Heat treatment did not further improve the 
stability comparing to untreated. In contrast to FA treated matrix, QC’s met the acceptance criteria in 
all storage condition besides RT, which is ~28% low bias. 
To understand the instability in untreated individual human plasma K2EDTA 
There were more than two lots of K2EDTA matrixes used during MD. In at least two lots, bortezomib 
did not exhibit stability at -20 ºC or -70 ºC. In troubleshooting experiments, 20 individual lots of 
human plasma K2EDTA were used to prepare HQC and LQC together with one of the pooled matrix lot 
used in MD and the lot used in matrix treatment test mentioned above. The qualified QC was then 
stored at -20 ºC and -70 ºC to be tested 48 hours later with HQC and LQC prepared again with the 
same lot on the day of extraction. 
Different levels of stability were displayed in the 20 individual lots after been stored. In total, 6 lots out 
of 20 failed after being stored at -70 ºC for 48 hours revealing degradation of 19-56% in HQC and 14-
48% in LQC. After being stored at -20 ºC, HQC and LQC prepared in 9 individual lots met the 
acceptance criteria, while the other 11 lots either failed at HQC or both concentrations. 
In conclusion, the investigation into bortezomib instability in human plasma K2EDTA indicates that 
bortezomib can be unstable in certain untreated human plasma K2EDTA. The observed instability is 
dependent on unknown interactions in human plasma K2EDTA. In some individual matrix lots, 
bortezomib was stable after 48 hours of storage at -20 ºC or -70 ºC. Pretreatment with formic acid is 
needed to stabilize bortezomib in K2EDTA (stored at 5 ºC, -20 ºC or -70 ºC) or NaHeparin (stored at -
20 ºC or -70 ºC) human plasma. 
The report is to summarize the observations leading to the final assessment that the study samples 
could not be analyzed in a regulated study (KPT-330-023). 
Absorption 
Selinexor  is  orally  bioavailable.  The  absorption  is  moderately  rapid  with  a  median  time  to  the  peak 
plasma concentration (tmax) of 2 to 4 hours. The consistent tmax across the range of doses evaluated 
(3 to 85 mg/m2) suggests dose-independent absorption. Although selinexor is a low soluble compound, 
it  exhibited  high  permeability  in  Caco-2  cells.  The  absolute  bioavailability  has  not  been  conducted  in 
humans.  Oral  bioavailability  of  selinexor  in  mice,  rats,  and  monkeys  is  high,  and  allometric  scaling  is 
consistent with high oral bioavailability in humans.

Distribution 
The distribution of selinexor is driven by plasma protein binding, which is approximately 95% and is not 
concentration dependent within the clinically relevant range. The blood to plasma ratio was less than 1, 
suggesting minimal association with red blood cells. The apparent central volume of distribution (Vc/F) 
was  113  L  and  the  apparent  peripheral  volume  of  distribution  (Vp/F)  was  20  L  (corresponding  to  an 
apparent volume of distribution at steady state [Vss/F] of 133 L or approximately 2 L/kg, assuming a 65 
kg mass). The Vss/F exceeded the total body water (approximately 40 L), consistent with distribution of 
selinexor into tissues. 
Elimination 
Metabolism 
Since  the  initial  MAA  submission  of  selinexor,  no  new  information  has  been  obtained  regarding  the 
metabolism  of  selinexor.  The  results  summarized  below  were  previously  presented  in  the  initial  MAA 
submission. 
Selinexor, as unchanged parent, is the major circulating moiety in human plasma. The most common 
circulating metabolite (<5% of peak of parent levels) is the trans-isomer of selinexor, designated KPT-
375. This isomer, which likely derives from cis-trans isomerization of selinexor, has approximately 10% 
of the XPO1 inhibiting activity of selinexor and no other known biological properties. In plasma, other 
metabolites individually accounted for less than 1% of parent at peak selinexor plasma concentrations. 
In  human  faeces,  the  predominant  metabolite  observed  was  KPT-452  (N-dealkylation;  inactive 
metabolite), which is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4. In human urine, the primary metabolite 
observed  was  KPT-5000  (cysteine  adduct;  inactive  metabolite),  which  is  catalyzed  by  glutathione  s-
transferase (GST). 
Selinexor  was  metabolically  stable  in  human  liver  microsomes  (HLM)  and  hepatocytes.  In  reaction 
phenotyping for CYPs and uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), limited metabolism of 
selinexor was observed and was catalyzed only by CYP3A4 and multiple UGTs. Similar to observations 
in humans, in nonclinical species, including radio-profiling in rats and cold metabolism in monkeys, low 
levels  of  circulating  metabolites  were  observed  and  unchanged  selinexor  was  the  primary  (>90%) 
circulating  moiety.  The  metabolites  observed  in  excreta  of  nonclinical  species  were  similar  to  those 
observed in humans. 
Thus, parent selinexor is the main moiety in plasma and the limited metabolism of selinexor is catalyzed 
by multiple enzymes, including CYP3A4, UGTs, and GSTs. Importantly, the metabolites include KPT-375 
(which  has  minimal  biological  activity),  and  at  lower  levels,  inactive  products  of  N-dealkylation, 
glucuronidation,  and  glutathione  (GSH)  conjugation.  Thus,  the  contribution  of  metabolites  to  the 
pharmacological activity of selinexor is negligible. 
Excretion 
Based on quantitation of selinexor in human urine in Study 003, urinary excretion is a minor elimination 
pathway for selinexor. In the rat mass balance and quantitative whole-body autoradiography study, total 
recovery was 93% suggesting minimal long-term retention, selinexor was found to be excreted primarily 
by  the  hepatobiliary  route  into  faeces  with  minimal excretion  in  urine  (<1%  unchanged  parent).  The 
terminal phase half-life (t½) of selinexor is approximately 6 hours and apparent clearance (CL/F) is 18.4 
L/h.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In dose escalation studies in patients with advanced hematologic and solid tumour malignancies (Study 
001 and 002, respectively), selinexor exhibited linear PK, demonstrating dose-proportional increase in 
exposure area under the concentration versus time curve [AUC] and maximum observed concentration 
[Cmax]). Selinexor was dosed 2 or 3 times weekly as a single agent and no substantial accumulation 
was evident following repeat dosing. At the 100 mg dose, the mean Cmax was 693 ng/mL and the mean 
AUC0-∞ was 6998 ng·h/mL (Study 001). 
Food effects 
The  presence  of  food  (high-  or  low-fat  meals)  delayed  selinexor  absorption  (tmax  from  1.7  to 
approximately 4 hours), however, there was minimal impact on exposures (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 
ranged between 114.7% and 125.5%) and this was not clinically relevant (Study 003). Meals with high- 
or  low-fat  content  did  not  have  a  substantial  effect  on  selinexor  PK  parameters.  Therefore,  selinexor 
should be taken with fluids and can be administered with or without food. The above results on food 
effect were previously presented in the initial MAA. 
Bioequivalence 
Selinexor  exposure  following  oral  administration  of  all  tested  formulations  was  considered  to  be 
functionally bioequivalent.  
Tablet formulation 2.2 (also known as TF2.2) and several other formulations were tested in Study 003: 
hard-gelatin capsules, first-generation tablets (also known as tablet formulation 1 or TF1) and TF2.2, 
and  a  suspension  formulation  (prepared  from  TF1).  All  3  formulations  tested  in  Study  003  were 
considered to be functionally bioequivalent based on AUC from the time of dosing to time t (AUC0-t) and 
AUC from the time of dosing extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞). The second-generation tablet TF2 was 
developed in preparation for registration and commercial batches of formulation. There is clinical tablet 
formulation  (TF2.2)  and  the  commercial/clinical  formulation  (TF2.3).  The  only  difference  in  the  TF2.3 
relative to TF2.2 is the removal of the trace yellow-colour pigment tartrazine from the outer top-coat, 
as a Scale-up and Post Approval Change (SUPAC) Level 1 change (FDA Guidance for Industry 1995). 
TF2.3 was found to exhibit similar in vitro dissolution performance with TF2.2 in f2 testing. 
Pharmacokinetic in the target population 
The population PK model was first developed and submitted with the initial MAA. The model was updated 
based on data from 793 patients across 7 clinical studies (second population PK model, Report MS-001) 
which was provided during the initial MAA procedure.

Other covariates evaluated, including dose, formulation, patient type, ECOG status, baseline labs and 
concomitant  medications  (CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers,  CYP2D6 
inhibitors,  CYP2C8 
inhibitors, 
dexamethasone, PPIs and H2 blockers), had no impact on the selinexor PK. The exposure of selinexor is 
dose proportional in the dose range from 4 to 175 mg. Patients with DLBCL had similar exposure level 
to patients with Non-DLBCL haematological malignancies or solid tumour. 
Population PK model in patients with multiple myeloma 
Dataset 
Forty  (40)  selinexor  PK  samples  were  collected  from  8  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  multiple 
myeloma in study BOSTON. The PK results of study BOSTON were combined with the dataset used for 
the previous analysis [1] to form an updated analysis dataset. The consolidated dataset included 9439 
selinexor  PK  observations  from  801  patients  with  acute  myeloid  leukemia  (AML),  diffuse  large  B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), MM, other hematologic cancers or other solid cancers.

Model simulations 
Steady state selinexor PK exposure were simulated using the Bayesian post-hoc PK parameters of each 
individual, where the impact of covariates and their correlation were accounted for. The simulation was 
done for the regimen of 100 mg QW. 
Boxplots of PK exposure are illustrated in Figure 6 and Figure 7 by study and tumour type, respectively. 
Although the number of patients was limited, PK exposure of study BOSTON appear to be similar to other 
studies including study KCP-330-012 (also in patients with MM) and study KCP-330-009 (patients with 
DLBCL). Selinexor was co-administrated with bortezomib and dexamethasone in study BOSTON, while 
it was co-administrated with dexamethasone alone in study KCP-330-012. The addition of bortezomib 
appears to have no impact on the selinexor PK. Comparing the PK exposure in patients with different 
patient types, Cmax and AUC in patients with MM were similar to the values in patients with AML, DLBCL 
and other hematologic and solid tumour types (Figure 7).

Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Assessment report  
EMA/620277/2022  
Page 33/151 
 
 
 
 
To verify previous findings and to satisfy PMR 3657-3, the effect of hepatic impairment on selinexor PK 
was formally evaluated in a separate clinical trial. 
Based on the second set of population PK analyses from pooled Phase 1 and 2 studies, the PK of selinexor 
was not substantially altered in patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment (based on National 
Cancer Institute organ dysfunction working group [NCI-ODWG] criteria) present either at baseline (N = 
119 for mild, N = 10 for moderate, N = 3 for severe). The effect of liver function on clearance of selinexor 
was evaluated across patients with various liver function test values in these population PK analyses. No 
significant relationships were identified between PK parameters and baseline total bilirubin, AST, ALT, 
ALB, or hepatic impairment. 
Taken  together,  the  results  demonstrated  that  selinexor  clearance  was  not  altered  substantially  as  a 
function of the severity of liver impairment. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with 
mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
Based on the concentrations of selinexor measured in urine (Study 003), renal clearance is a minor route 
of elimination for selinexor. Population PK analyses from patients with normal (N = 283), mild (N = 309), 
moderate (N = 185), or severe (N = 13), renal dysfunction were evaluated (mean [min, max] baseline 
CrCL = 77.7 [20, 295.3] mL/min) from Phase 1 and 2 studies were conducted. Baseline CrCL had no 
impact on the PK of selinexor. Therefore, mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment is not expected to 
alter selinexor PK, and no selinexor dose adjustments are required in patients with renal dysfunction. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The effect of a strong CYP3A inhibitor on the PK of selinexor will be formally evaluated in Study KCP-
330-017  (Study  017/STOMP)  to  verify  the  findings  from  population  PK  analyses  and  to  satisfy  post-
marketing requirement (PMR) 3657-4. 
Selinexor once weekly (QW) is not expected to alter exposures of other drugs and exposures to selinexor 
are  unlikely  to  be  affected  by  concomitant  administrations  of  modulators  of  major  CYP  enzymes, 
including CYP3A4, based on in vitro drug-drug interaction (DDI) evaluations and population PK analysis 
that included more than 700 patients with PK data. 
A thorough investigation for drug interaction potential was done by conducting a series of in vitro studies 
which  included  CYP  phenotyping,  UGT  phenotyping,  metabolic  stability,  substrate  and  inhibition 
assessment  of  metabolic  transporters,  and  inhibition  of  major  human  CYP  enzymes.  The  very  low 
turnover  in  HLM  and  recombinant  enzymes  suggested  selinexor  is  metabolically  stable.  The  limited 
metabolism was catalyzed by CYP3A4 (and not the other CYP enzymes), UGTs and GSTs. 
Selinexor is not a substrate for major metabolic hepatic, renal, and intestinal transporters breast cancer 
resistance  protein  (BCRP),  permeability  glycoprotein  (P-gp),  organic  anion  transporting  polypeptide 
OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  organic  anion  transporter  OAT1,  OAT3,  organic  cation  transporter  OCT1,  OCT2, 
multidrug and toxin extrusion MATE1 and MATE2-K (Section 2.1.4). Selinexor did not inhibit metabolic 
solute carrier (SLC) transporters except for marginal inhibition of OATP1B1 and 1B3, which may not be 
clinically relevant. The potential for DDIs due to inhibition of major human CYPs (CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5) is very low (all concentrations resulting in 50% of the maximum inhibition 
(IC50s) values for CYP inhibition >10 μM), including CYP3A4/5 IC50 of 24 μM and no demonstrable CYP 
induction is observed. 
Although  selinexor  is  metabolized  by  conjugation  with  GSH,  co-administration  with  acetaminophen 
(paracetamol) at therapeutic dose was found not to affect the PK of selinexor. In a subset of patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/620277/2022  
Page 34/151 
 
 
 
evaluated in Study 002 co-administration of acetaminophen at doses up to 1000 mg appeared to have 
no effect on the exposure of selinexor. 
In  the  second  population  PK  model,  no  significant  relationships  were  identified  between  model 
parameters  and  concomitant  administration  of  CYP3A4/2D6/2C8  modulators,  dexamethasone,  proton 
pump inhibitors, and H2 blockers. 
Based  on the  metabolism and  in  vitro  drug  interaction  profiles  of  selinexor  and  bortezomib,  no drug-
drug interaction between selinexor and bortezomib is expected. Exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC) 
of  selinexor  in  patients  in  BOSTON  who  received  combination  dosing  of  selinexor,  bortezomib  and 
dexamethasone were shown to be similar to patients in selinexor monotherapy studies (MS-003) and 
confirm the lack of effect of bortezomib on the PK of selinexor. 
Based  on  findings  from  in  vitro  studies  and  given  that  there  have  been  no  clinically  significant  DDIs 
reported in >3200 patients treated with selinexor alone or in combination as of this Type II variation, 
the overall risk for PK based DDIs with selinexor is considered to be low. Moreover, no DDIs have been 
reported in post-marketing studies to date. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Exposure-QT analyses 
No proarrhythmic effects of selinexor have been documented to date, and none of the new analyses as 
described below have raised concerns along these lines. 
The concentration-QT modelling analyses included data for PK time-matched QTc from 85 patients from 
the two Phase 1 studies Study 001 and Study 003. No significant (p>0.05) relationship by dose levels 
was  observed  between  QT  interval  corrected  by  Fridericia’s  formula  (ΔQTcF)  and  selinexor 
concentrations. Linear mixed-effect modelling demonstrated a small positive slope such that a selinexor 
concentration of 1200 ng/mL (approximately 2-fold of the anticipated therapeutic concentration [Cmax] 
from the 100 mg dose) correlates with a potential mean ΔQTcF increase of 7.2 msec, with a 90% CI of 
<20 msec increase above baseline. Therefore, selinexor is not expected to cause clinically relevant QTc 
prolongation at the therapeutic dose concentrations of selinexor with ΔQTcF expected to remain within 
20 msec of baseline. Additionally, none of the patients had a ΔQTcF of >60 msec in the PK population. 
A categorical outlier analysis and an analysis of proarrhythmic AEs of the ECG intervals in Study 001 and 
Study 003 was also conducted. In addition, all patients with post-treatment QTcF ≥500 msec or QTcF 
>60 msec change from baseline were on concomitant medications known to prolong QT and many had 
electrolyte abnormalities. The majority of proarrhythmic AEs were at Grade 2 or less and were considered 
by investigators as not related to the study treatment. The results from all the analyses discussed above 
demonstrated  that  selinexor  does  not  cause  QT  prolongation  at  exposures  or  doses  well  above 
therapeutic doses. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Selinexor exposure-efficacy relationships in RRMM patients and exposure-safety relationships in patients 
with advanced hematologic malignancies were evaluated in the initial MAA. 
Exposure-response efficacy analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of exposure (AUC) and dose 
intensity on the measures of efficacy, including overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), 
best overall response (BOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), in patients with 
heavily pre-treated MM who received selinexor plus dexamethasone (Sd regimen) assuming that efficacy 
Assessment report  
EMA/620277/2022  
Page 35/151 
 
 
 
responses  were  driven  by  selinexor.  No  discernible  exposure-efficacy  relationships  were  observed  for 
patients who received 80 mg selinexor plus low-dose dexamethasone. 
Exposure-safety logistic regression analyses were conducted for the five endpoints (thrombocytopenia, 
hyponatremia, and fatigue Grade ≥3 TEAEs as well  as AEs leading to discontinuation or death). Both 
AUC  and  Cmax  were  used  as  exposure  metrics  in  the  analyses.  Statistically  significant  trends  for 
increases in ≥ Grade 3 events of hyponatremia, fatigue, and AEs leading to discontinuation were found 
through logistic regression modelling. 
Exposure-response analyses were not conducted using data from the BOSTON study given the limited 
PK  data  obtained  (8  patients  and  40  samples)  and  given  the  availability  of  prior  analyses  and  data 
(STORM  study)  to  inform  the  expected  efficacy  and  safety  of  selinexor  and  bortezomib  combination 
therapy.  Exposure-response  relationships  presented  in  the  initial  MAA  are  useful  to  inform  the 
contribution of selinexor and dexamethasone when used in combination with bortezomib in BOSTON on 
applicable safety endpoints for patients with multiple myeloma. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The investigation into bortezomib instability in human plasma K2EDTA indicates that bortezomib can be 
unstable in certain untreated human plasma K2EDTA. The observed instability is dependent on 
unknown interactions in human plasma K2EDTA. In some individual matrix lots, bortezomib was stable 
after 48 hours of storage at -20 ºC or -70 ºC. Pretreatment with formic acid is needed to stabilize 
bortezomib in K2EDTA (stored at 5 ºC, -20 ºC or -70 ºC) or NaHeparin (stored at -20 ºC or -70 ºC) 
human plasma. 
The clinical pharmacology properties of selinexor have been evaluated to fulfil the Specific Obligation of 
the Conditional Marketing Authorization on the use of selinexor in combination with dexamethasone for 
the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least four prior therapies and 
whose disease is refractory to at least two proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents and 
an anti CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
An  additional  indication  has  been  requested  to  support  the  use  of  selinexor  in  combination  with 
bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who 
have received at least 1 prior therapy, based on the global Phase 3 BOSTON (KCP-330-023) study. The 
proposed dosing regimen for the new indication is selinexor 100 mg QW PO, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 QW, 
and dexamethasone 20 mg BIW PO.  
DLBCL and other cancer types 
In order to support the positive opinion for the initial MAA, the Applicant applied a two-compartment 
model with sequential zero- and first-order absorption kinetics to data from 793 patients across 7 clinical 
studies. The final population PK parameters were precisely estimated, based on the relative standard 
error (<30%) and statistically significant, based on the 95% confidence interval (CI). However, the large 
inter-individual  variability  associated  to  ka  (1.94)  leads  to  an  over-estimation  of  the  inter-individual 
random effects, which translates into an over-prediction of the Cmax (Figures 6 and 8). The Applicant 
evaluated  additional  factors  on  ka,  but  none  of  them  were  statistically  significant  or  led  to  clinically 
relevant differences in exposure. Final population PK model incorporates sex on CL/F, and body weight 
on CL/F and Vc/F and the final parameter estimates are in agreement with standard values reported in 
the literature. The impact of covariates on selinexor exposure of patients with DLBCL and other cancer 
types suggested no clinically relevant changes in terms of selinexor AUC.

In order to support the indication of selinexor in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), the PK properties 
of selinexor were characterized based on the previously developed population PK model in patients with 
DLBCL  and  other  cancer  types.  The  Applicant has  conducted  the  evaluation of  experimental  evidence 
gathered  from  study  BOSTON  to  inform  that  neither  the  disease  condition  nor  the  combination  with 
bortezomib are affecting the PK properties of selinexor. The lack of significant differences in the adequacy 
of the popPK predictions among the different study types demonstrated the validity of the experimental 
evidence considered to develop the population PK model. No significant differences were observed on 
CL/F and V/F between patients with MM from the STORM and BOSTON studies. At the same time, the 
pc-VPC is able to characterize the experimental evidence with good agreement, although the prediction 
interval covers the 5-95th percentiles (which should be done only when sparse data (KCP-330-023 study) 
is available). 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  characterization  of  the  clinical  pharmacology  properties  of  Selinexor,  regarding  the  indication  of 
selinexor in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with 
multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least 1 prior therapy, is endorsed. The level of evidence 
provided is considered sufficient. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The data presented by the MAH is for supporting this Grouped Type II /Type IB variation:  
• 
The Type II variation is to extend the indication for Nexpovio to be used “in combination with 
bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who 
have received at least one prior therapy”. In addition, the results from the pivotal study in support 
of this application were intended to fulfil the Specific Obligation (SOB) in the context of the 
Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) of Nexpovio (selinexor) which was granted on 26 March 
2021. 
• 
The Type IB variation relates to the introduction of a new pack size (8 tablets per pack) for added 
convenience to patients for dose modification in the new intended treatment setting.

2.4.1.  Dose response study  
Phase 1b/2 Study KCP-330-017 (STOMP) 
The  STOMP  study  was  a  Phase  1b/2,  multi-arm  open  label,  multicenter,  clinical  study  with  Dose 
Escalation (Phase 1) and Expansion (Phase 2) to independently assess the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD)/recommended  Phase  2  dose  (RP2D),  safety,  and  efficacy  of  7  treatment  arms  (selinexor  in 
combination with backbone treatments) in patients with either newly diagnosed MM or previously treated 
MM. 
Each arm started with a Dose Escalation Phase followed by a RP2D Expansion Phase. 
Approximately 241 to 321 patients were considered needed for this study. This includes 96-186 patients 
in the Dose Escalation Phase and 145 patients in the Expansion Phase. 
Phase 1 - Dose Escalation Phase (in SVd Arm): 
Arm 2 (SVd) had 2 cohorts to evaluate once-weekly (QW) vs. twice-weekly (BIW) selinexor dosing. 
The dose of selinexor was escalated from 80 mg to 100 mg in once-weekly cohorts and from 60 mg to 
80 mg in twice-weekly cohorts, given with bortezomib once or BIW along with ‘low dose’ (40 mg weekly) 
dexamethasone. 
Using the MTD results for both Cohorts, the SRC determine which MTD schedule will become the RP2D 
in the Expansion Phase. 
Phase 2 – Expansion Phase  
During the Expansion Phase, it was planned that a total of approximately 146-243 patients across the 7 
Arms  will  receive  the  RP2D  determined  by  the  SRC  for  each  Arm  separately.  Dose  modifications  to 
manage tolerability were allowed during the Expansion Phase. 
Patients  continued  to  receive  treatment  until  disease  progression  (however  patients  may  stay  on 
treatment if they have clinical benefit per the Investigator), death, toxicity (i.e., adverse events (AEs) 
that cannot be managed with medical care), or withdrawal from the study. The study will end when all 
patients  have  completed  the  one-year  Follow-up  Period  (i.e.,  when  the  last  patient  has  died,  been 
followed for 12 months after last dose of study drug (selinexor, bortezomib, or dexamethasone), been 
lost to follow-up, or has withdrawn consent, whichever occurs first). 
The  RP2D  established  in  the  SVd  arm  [Arm  2  SVd  (selinexor  +bortezomib  +  dexamethasone)]  of 
STOMP was to be used in the BOSTON study. 
Based  on  the  results,  the  selected  dose/regimen  for  further  exploration  in  the  BOSTON  study  was 
selinexor 100 mg QW and bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 QW plus dexamethasone 40 mg QW. 
2.4.2.  Main study: KCP-330-023/BOSTON study 
KCP-330-023  is  a  confirmatory  phase  3,  2-arm,  randomized,  active  comparator-controlled, 
open-label,  multicenter  study  that  compares  the  efficacy  and  health-related  quality  of  life 
(HR-QoL)  and  assesses  the  safety  of  selinexor  plus  bortezomib  (Velcade  or  generic 
equivalent)  plus 
low-dose  dexamethasone  (SVd)  versus  bortezomib  plus 
low-dose 
dexamethasone  (Vd)  in  adult  patients  with  RRMM  who  have  received  1  to  3  prior  anti-MM 
regimens.

Methods 
The study overview is presented in the Figure below: 
Figure 1. BOSTON: Bortezomib, Selinexor, and Dexamethasone in Patients with Multiple 
Myeloma- Study Overview 
Abbreviations: IA = interim analysis; IRC = Independent Review Committee; ITT = intent-to-treat; PD = progressive disease; PFS = 
progression-free survival; SdX = selinexor plus low-dose dexamethasone treatment after crossover; SVd = selinexor plus 
bortezomib plus low-dose dexamethasone; SVdX = SVd treatment after crossover; Vd = bortezomib plus low-dose dexamethasone. 
Data cut-off: 
•  Primary analysis: Data cut-off date of 18 February 2020 (main efficacy data). 
•  Updated analysis: 15 February 2021. 
Patients in the Vd Arm who have progressive disease (PD) that is confirmed by the Independent Review 
Committee (IRC) were allowed to cross over to a regimen that includes selinexor:  
1) SVd treatment (SVdX) for patients who are able to tolerate continued bortezomib, or  
2) SdX for patients who have significant tolerability issues with bortezomib. 
Patients who crossed over are referred to as SVdX patients or SdX patients, respectively. 
Patients  who  do  not  elect to  cross  over  to  SVdX  or  SdX  from  the  Vd  Arm  will  discontinue  treatment, 
proceed to the End of Treatment (EoT) Visit, and be followed for survival. 
The following process was used to prevent premature crossover: 
• 
Investigators assessed PD according to the IMWG criteria, including repeat testing if PD was based 
on  serum  and/or  urine  M-protein,  quantitative  immunoglobulins  for  IgA/IgD,  or  serum  free  light 
chain (FLC). PD could also be based on new or enlarging plasmacytoma(s) or bone lesion(s) or on 
other symptoms and signs of clinical progression that met the IMWG criteria. 
•  All cases of PD were confirmed by the IRC prior to crossover. 
Figure 1. BOSTON: Bortezomib, Selinexor, and Dexamethasone in Patients with 
Multiple Myeloma- Study Overview  
EMA/620277/2022  
Page 40/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Crossover was not permitted based purely on Investigator assessed progression that did not meet 
any IMWG criteria for PD and could not be verified by IRC (e.g., deteriorating performance status). 
•  Crossover was not permitted if dosing of bortezomib was terminated before PD was confirmed by 
the  IRC,  unless  termination  of  bortezomib  was  due  to  significant  toxicities  such  as  PN,  and  all 
treatment measures addressing these toxicities were exhausted and documented prior to bortezomib 
termination. Early termination of bortezomib was discussed and approved by the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor in order to allow crossover to SdX after progression was confirmed by the IRC. 
• 
Investigator  assessed  presumptive  PD  events  that  were  not  confirmed  by  the  IRC  had  their  PFS 
censored at the time of treatment discontinuation. 
Multiple myeloma evaluations for both arms were done every 3 weeks from baseline on Cycle 1 
Day  1  (C1D1)  through  the  first  day  of  Week  37  (i.e.  12  MM  evaluations  occurred  after  C1D1)  to 
identify patients who progressed quickly, then every 5 weeks for the remainder of the study, regardless 
of cycle length. 
Dose modifications for selinexor to manage tolerability were allowed. 
Independent Review Committee 
An IRC was formed to review MM disease assessment data for this study, to independently assess disease 
response and time of PD.  
PD  based  on  site  generated  MM  disease  assessment  data  were  to  be  confirmed  by  the  IRC  prior  to 
discontinuing treatment from either arm (unless medically contraindicated).  
PD as a result of plasmacytoma(s) or bone lesion(s) was to be reviewed by the IRC and results to be 
compared with baseline assessments.  
IRC confirmation of PD was required for all patients and, for those patients in the Vd Arm, confirmation 
was required prior to initiation of SVdX treatment in the crossover. The IRC reviewed data (generated 
by the local and central laboratory) that was to be used for the final analysis of the primary endpoints.  
The IRC’s assessments of PFS and ORR were planned to be used as the basis for the evaluation of the 
primary endpoints.

Treatments 
SVd arm:  
•  Selinexor: 100 mg PO on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 of each 35-day cycle  
•  Bortezomib: 1.3 mg/m2 SC on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 35-day cycle  
•  Dexamethasone: 20 mg PO on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23, 29, and 30 of each 35-day cycle  
Vd arm: 
First 8 cycles:  
•  Bortezomib: 1.3 mg/m2 SC on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21-day cycle.  
•  Dexamethasone: 20 mg PO dose on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of each 21-day cycle. 
Cycles ≥9: 
•  Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 SC on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 35-day cycle.  
•  Dexamethasone: 20 mg PO dose on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23, 29, and 30 of each 35-day 
cycle.  
SVdX arm:  
Patients who crossed over from Vd treatment to SVdX following the Cycle 1 of SVd treatment 
as described above. 
Dose modifications for selinexor, dexamethasone, and bortezomib were allowed to manage tolerability.  
Study treatment (SVd, Vd, or crossover) continued until PD was confirmed by the IRC, Investigator 
or  patient  decision  to  discontinue  study  treatment, pregnancy,  unacceptable adverse  events  (AEs)  or 
toxicity that could not be managed by supportive care, withdrawal of consent, death, or Sponsor decision 
to terminate the study. 
PD  confirmation  by  IRC  was  needed  prior  to  discontinuation,  unless  medically  contraindicated.  An 
exception was allowed for patients in the Vd arm who terminated bortezomib treatment prior to IRC-
confirmed PD if the termination was due to significant toxicities, such as PN, and all treatment measures 
addressing  these  toxicities  were  exhausted  and  documented  prior  to  bortezomib  termination.  Early

termination  of  bortezomib  was  discussed  and  approved  by  the  Sponsor’s  Medical  Monitor  in  order  to 
allow crossover to SdX after progression was confirmed by the IRC. 
After IRC-confirmed PD: 
•  Patients in the SVd arm completed the End of Treatment Visit and were followed for survival. 
•  Patients in the Vd arm either crossed over or discontinued study treatment, completed the End 
of Treatment Visit, and were followed for survival 
Crossover from the Vd arm to a treatment that included Sd ± bortezomib (i.e., SVdX or SdX) was allowed 
at the point of IRC-confirmed objective PD per the IMWG criteria for patients in the Vd arm. 
Patients in the Vd arm who were able to tolerate continued bortezomib treatment were allowed to cross 
over to SVdX treatment. 
Patients  in  the  Vd  arm  who  had  significant  tolerability  issues  with  bortezomib  (i.e.,  were  unable  to 
tolerate any continued bortezomib treatment (e.g., due to Grade >2 PN or Grade ≥2 PN with pain) were 
allowed to cross over to SdX treatment. 
Selinexor Dose Escalation  
A selinexor dose escalation may be considered up cycle 3 (C3) for patients being treated with a selinexor-
containing regimen (ie, SVd Arm, SVdX treatment, or SdX treatment) who meet the following 3 criteria:  
1)  do not achieve at least a PR within the first 2 cycles,  
2)  are tolerating SVd well at dose level 0, and  
3)  do not have any AEs related to study treatment Grade >2 (National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 4.03) at the time of dose escalation. For 
Cycles  ≥3,  selinexor  may  be  increased  to  a  fixed  oral  60  mg  dose  twice  weekly  during  Weeks  1 
through 5.  
For patients who dose escalate, selinexor will be given as a fixed oral 60 mg dose on Days 1, 3, 8, 10, 
15, 17, 22, 24, 29, and 31 of each 35-day cycle.  
Dexamethasone (20 mg) will be given on the same days as selinexor. 
Figure 2. SVd Arm Dose Schedule; 5-Week (35-Day) Cycle 
Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; BIW = twice weekly; Bort = bortezomib; BSA = body surface area; CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events; D = Day; Dex  = dexamethasone; eCRF = electronic case report form; MM = multiple myeloma; NCI = National Cancer 
Institute;  PR  =  partial  response:  QW  =  once  weekly;  SC  =  subcutaneous;  Sel  =  selinexor;  SVd  =  selinexor  plus  bortezomib  plus  low-dose 
dexamethasone. 1 Selinexor will be given as a fixed oral 100 mg dose QW. In no case may the selinexor dose exceed 70 mg/m2 per dose for 
any patient. If the patient’s weight fluctuates substantially from baseline (i.e., > 20%) during SVd treatment, BSA should be recalculated. 2 
Bortezomib will be given at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 SC QW during Weeks 1 through 4, followed by a 13-day rest period. 3 Dexamethasone will be 
given as an oral 20 mg dose BIW (i.e., a total of 40 mg weekly). For patients who develop partial intolerance to glucocorticoids during the study 
(as determined by the Investigator), a dose reduction to  a minimum dose of 10 to 12 mg dexamethasone BIW (i.e., a total of 20 to 24 mg 
weekly) is 
permitted after a clear documentation of intolerance. Any dose reductions should be documented in the patient’s research record and the eCRF. 
4 Selinexor will be given as a fixed oral 60 mg dose BIW during Weeks 1 through 5 of Cycles ≥ 3. If the patient’s weight fluctuates substantially 
from baseline (i.e., > 20%) during SVd treatment, BSA should be recalculated.

Duration of Treatment and Follow-up 
Study treatment (SVd, Vd, SVdX, or SdX) may continue until PD is confirmed by the IRC, Investigator 
or patient decision to discontinue study treatment, pregnancy, unacceptable AEs or toxicity that cannot 
be  managed  by  supportive  care,  withdrawal  of  consent,  death,  or  Sponsor  decision  to  terminate  the 
study.  
After discontinuation of SVd, Vd, SVdX, or SdX patients will be followed for survival every 3 months until 
the end of study (ie, when the last patient treated in the study has been followed for up to 5 years after 
their last dose of SVd/Vd/SVdX/SdX treatment).

Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  designed  to  have  80%  power  to  detect  a  median  time  to  PFS  for  patients 
treated  with  SVd  of  13.5  months  versus  patients treated  with  Vd  of  9.4  months,  using  a  1-sided 
alpha  of  0.025,  15  months  accrual  and  18  months  follow  up,  and  a  1:1  allocation  of  treatment  to 
SVd:Vd, and allowing for an interim analysis (IA) of PFS (second IA) for futility or superiority, with the 
treatment difference assessed by a log-rank test. 
Based  on  these  statistical  assumptions,  a  total  of  267  PFS  events  were  required  for  the  final 
analysis. To achieve these events, a total of approximately 364 patients (~182 patients/arm) were 
required for enrolment.  
The justification of a median time to PFS of 9.4 months in the Vd Arm was based on previous clinical 
studies  (ENDEAVOR  and  CASTOR),  both  of  which  had  similar  eligibility  criteria  to  the  BOSTON  study 
where PFS was 9.4 months (Dimopoulos et al., 2016) and 7.2 months, respectively (Palumbo et al., 
2016). Median time to PFS in the SVd Arm was based on preliminary results from Karyopharm’s STOMP 
study  (Study  KCP-330-017).  An  exponential  dropout  rate  of  0.65%  per  month  (equivalently 
approximately 10% dropout after 18 months) is assumed. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment arms (SVd or Vd). Randomization 
was  stratified  for  prior  PI  therapy  (yes  or  no),  number  of  prior  anti-MM  regimens  (1  versus  >1  and 
disease severity at study entry (based on the revised International Staging System [R-ISS]; Stage III 
versus Stage I or II). 
Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (SVd or Vd) in a 1:1 allocation, as follows: 
•  SVd arm: selinexor (QW) + SC bortezomib (QW) + dexamethasone.  
•  Vd arm: SC bortezomib (Cycles 1-8 BIW, Cycles ≥9 QW) + dexamethasone.  
Randomization will be stratified based on: 
─  4 Regions 
o  Region 1 (USA, Canada) 
o  Region 2 (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Israel, Australia) 
o  Region 3 (Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Poland) 
o  Region 4 (India, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia) 
─  Prior PI therapies (Yes or No) 
─  Number of prior anti-MM regimens (1 versus > 1) 
─  Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) stage at study entry based on screening results 
(R-ISS  Stage  III  versus  R-ISS  Stage  I  or  II)  (Palumbo  2016).  If  data  for  chromosomal 
abnormalities and serum lactate dehydrogenase required for R-ISS staging were not available, 
patients  were  assigned  to  the  R-ISS  category  corresponding  to  their  International  Staging 
System (ISS) stage.

Study plan 
For each patient that signs the informed consent, the study consists of: 
Screening/baseline visit occurs within 28 days prior to receiving the 1st dose of study treatment 
Treatment period: there is no maximum treatment duration.

Follow-up period: up to 5 years after their last dose of SVd/Vd/SVdX/SdX treatment, patients will be 
contacted approximately every 3 months for durability of response and survival follow-up. Completion 
of follow-up for the last patient will occur when the last patient in the study has been followed for up to 
5 years after their last dose of SVd/Vd/SVdX/SdX treatment, has withdrawn consent, has been withdrawn 
from the study by the Investigator, has died, or has been lost to follow-up, whichever occurs first. 
Study hypothesis: Superiority 
Interim analyses 
Two interim analyses for primary PFS endpoint are planned. 
Interim Analysis for Sample Size Re-estimation 
The first interim analysis (IA) was conducted with data cut of 21 Jan 2019 after 113 events were accrued. 
The purpose of the first IA was for sample size re-adjustment. The DSMB met on 21 Feb 2019 and based 
on the safety and efficacy data, the DSMB recommendation was continuation of the study with no change 
to safety monitoring and no sample size adjustment. Thus, there is no need for type I error adjustment 
for final analysis according to CHW method (Cui et al., 1999). 
Interim Analysis for Futility or Superiority 
A second interim analysis was originally planned after approximately 75% of the planned number of PFS 
events (i.e., approximately 201 PFS events) have occurred, and would allow for a conclusion of efficacy, 
and stopping for futility (non-binding). 
Due to concerns that the trial was not going to reach the planned 267 events, and that it would take an 
extended period of time to accrue additional PFS events with minimal gain in power, the MAH proposed 
to use the second IA as the final efficacy analyses no matter the outcome is positive or not. With DSMB 
agreement, the second IA was used as the final PFS analysis and used all one-sided alpha of 0.025. 
The null hypothesis of PFS endpoint will not be re-tested at any subsequent timepoint. 
Patient response will be assessed centrally by an IRC according to IMWG response criteria (Kumar, 2016) 
for MM. Unless otherwise specified, MM response assessment refers to assessment determined by IRC. 
For  patients  in  the  Vd  arm,  crossing  over  to  SVdX  or  SdX  will  be  considered  as  initiating  a  new  MM 
treatment. 
Primary endpoint 
PFS:  The  primary  analysis  of  PFS  will  be  performed  by  treatment  (SVd  versus  Vd)  on  the  ITT 
population. The analysis will be repeated for the PP population as a supportive analysis. 
PFS outcome and censoring definition 
Figure 2. SVd Arm Dose Schedule; 5-Week (35-Day) Cycle  
EMA/620277/2022  
Page 49/151 
 
 
 
A stratified log-rank test will be used to compare the PFS between treatment arms (SVd versus Vd) for 
the  primary  efficacy  assessment.  The  strata  will  include  prior  PI  therapies,  number  of  prior  anti-MM 
regimens, and R-ISS stage at study entry. 
Hazard  ratios  and  its  95%  CI  will  be  estimated  by  a  stratified  Cox  proportional  hazards  model,  with 
Efron’s method of tie handling, with treatment as the factor. The strata will include prior PI therapies, 
number of prior anti-MM regimens, and R-ISS stage at study entry. A non-stratified log-rank test and a 
Cox proportional hazards model will be used as sensitivity analyses. 
Additional sensitivity analyses will be performed on the ITT population for the PFS primary endpoint as 
outlined below: 
•  Events are defined as IRC-confirmed progression or death, whichever occurs first.  
• 
Patients are censored at the date of last disease assessment if no progression is confirmed by 
the IRC, or treatment is discontinued for any reason, or new anticancer treatment is started, or 
death or progression occurs after 2 or more missed visits 
•  Similar to the primary PFS endpoint analysis but where treatment discontinuation for any reason 
is counted as an event 
•  Similar to the primary PFS endpoint analysis but where the initiation of non-study antineoplastic 
therapy is counted as an event 
•  Similar  to  the  primary  PFS  endpoint  analysis  but  where  clinical  progression  is  counted  as  an 
event in addition to IRC-confirmed PD. Clinical progression is defined as the event when a patient 
discontinues the treatment with reason of PD but is not classified as PD by IRC. 
•  Similar to the primary PFS endpoint analysis but where the timing of IRC-confirmed PD at an 
unscheduled visit is changed to the next scheduled visit

•  Comparison of PFS endpoint by treatment based on investigator’s assessment 
Analyses of Key Secondary Endpoints 
The following 3 endpoints are defined as key secondary endpoints: ORR, the incidence of any > Grade 
2 peripheral neuropathy events and response rate for responses >VGPR will be tested at the time of the 
second PFS IA. 
Statistical significance of key secondary endpoints will not be claimed until the primary endpoint of PFS 
have  reached  significance.  The  key  secondary  endpoints  will  be  tested  using  the  hierarchical  testing 
procedure to maintain the overall type I error at a 1-sided 0.025 level of significance.  
The testing sequence will be: 
•  ORR,  defined  as  any  response  >  PR  (i.e.  PR,  VGPR,  CR  or  sCR)  based  on  the  IRC’s  response 
outcome assessments, according to the IMWG response criteria. 
• 
Incidence of any >Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy events 
•  Response rates for > VGPR based on the IRC’s assessment 
Regarding secondary endpoints, specifically for OS analysis, since patients in the Vd arm are allowed to 
crossover to SVdX and SdX treatment after PD, adjustment for the effect of crossover on OS may be 
performed  based  on  Rank  Preserving  Structural  Failure  Time  (RPSFT)  model  proposed  by  Robins  and 
Tsiatis (1991). 
Multiple comparisons/multiplicity 
The overall type I error for the primary endpoint and each key secondary endpoint is strictly controlled 
at 2.5% (one-sided). 
Statistical significance of key secondary endpoints will not be claimed until the primary endpoint of PFS 
have  reached  significance.  The  key  secondary  endpoints  will  be  tested  using  the  hierarchical  testing 
procedure to maintain the overall type I error.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 457 patients were screened for inclusion in the study; 402 patients were randomized, and 
399 patients received at least one dose of study treatment.  
Of the 402 randomized patients, 195 were randomized onto the SVd arm (all dosed) and 207 patients 
were randomized to the Vd arm, of which 204 were dosed. Three patients randomized to the Vd arm 
were not dosed due to withdrawal of consent, death, and AE.

As of the data cut-off date of 18 Feb 2020 (primary analysis), the median follow-up was 17.3 months 
in the SVd arm and 17.5 months in the Vd arm. In the updated analysis (15 Feb 2021), the median 
follow-up was 28.71 months in the SVd arm and 28.65 months in the Vd arm. 
The  most  common  reasons  for  overall  treatment  discontinuation  were  PD  (174  patients  [43.6%]), 
withdrawal by patient (55 patients [13.8%]), and AEs (56 patients [14.0%]). More patients discontinued 
due to PD in the Vd arm compared to the SVd arm (52.5% versus 34.4%).  
Discontinuations due to deaths on or within 30 days of last dose of treatment were similar in the 2 arms. 
However, there were more discontinuations due to AEs in the SVd arm versus the Vd arm (16.9% versus 
11.3%).

The median ages of the patients in BOSTON were 66 and 67 years in the SVd and Vd arms, respectively. 
The majority of the patients were 65 years of age or older (SVd, 55.9%; Vd, 63.8%) and ~20% were 
≥75 years of age. More males were enrolled in the study than females (males: SVd, 59.0%; Vd, 55.6%) 
and the race was predominantly White (SVd, 82.6%; Vd, 79.7%).

genetic abnormalities (patients may have >1 abnormality). Of note, 56 (28.7%) patients in the SVd arm and 70 (33.8%) in 
the Vd arm had moderate to severe renal dysfunction with a creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min at baseline. 
As expected, patients in the BOSTON study had multiple ongoing comorbidities at baseline, (median of 
4 for both arms; Module 2.7.3, Section 3.1.4). Of note the most frequent comorbidity was cataract as 
seen in 60% and 62.3% of patients in the SVd and Vd arm respectively. Additional frequent comorbidities

included hypertension (SVd, 45.6%; Vd, 49.3%), PN (SVd, 12.3%; Vd, 15.5%), hypothyroidism (SVd, 
11.3%; Vd, 5.3%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (SVd, 10.3%; Vd, 7.7%). 
Approximately 50% of the patients had received 1 prior anti-MM therapy (SVd, 50.8%; Vd, 47.8%) 
with one-third having 2 prior regimens, and the remainder having 3 prior regimens for MM.

Approximately 75% of patients (SVd, 75.9%; Vd, 76.8%), had previously received a PI with the 
majority receiving bortezomib (SVd, 68.7%; Vd, 70.0%). Prior lenalidomide treatment was also common 
(SVd, 39.5%; Vd, 37.2%). Prior high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue had been administered

to 39.0% and 30.4% of patients in the SVd and Vd arms, respectively. Of note, more patients in the SVd 
arm had received prior pomalidomide and/or daratumumab than in the Vd arm (pomalidomide, 5.6% vs 
3.4% and daratumumab, 5.6% vs 2.9%, respectively). 
Approximately one-third of patients had prior stem cell transplantation. Similar proportions of patients 
in  both  arms  had  received  prior  anti-MM  radiotherapy (15.4%  in  the SVd arm,  19.8%  in Vd arm) and 
prior anti-MM surgery (5.6% in the SVd arm, 6.8% in Vd arm).

Overall, a 34% of patients received an SCT prior to entering the BOSTON study (39% in the SvD arms 
and 30.4% in the Vd arm). Of note, 33% of patients were >70 years old at enrolment (at diagnosis 24%

of patients were >70 years old) and would generally not be considered for ASCT per the European Society 
for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines.  
Numbers analysed 
For the BOSTON study, the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (N=402) consisted of 195 and 207 patients 
randomized to the SVd and Vd arms, respectively.  
Three patients never received study drug in the Vd arm and were excluded from the per-protocol (PP) 
population.  
In  addition,  2  patients  from  the  Vd  arm  and  1  patient  from  the  SVd  arm  were  excluded  from  the  PP 
population due to <70% compliance of study drug (2 patients) and protocol deviation (1 patient).

Outcomes and estimation 
Patient response was assessed centrally by an IRC according to the IMWG response criteria for MM 
(Kumar 2016). The response data presented in the following sections refer to these assessments by 
the IRC, unless otherwise specified. 
All efficacy analyses were conducted using the ITT population, unless otherwise specified and all 
tests (log-rank tests, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests) were one-sided, unless otherwise stated. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Progression-Free Survival 
As per the primary analysis the KCP-330-023 (BOSTON) study achieved its primary endpoint with a 
statistically significant improvement in median PFS in the SVd arm (13.93 months) compared with the 
Vd arm (9.46 months; p=0.0075; HR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.5279-0.9335). This represents an increase in 
median PFS of more than 4.4 months (a 47% improvement) and a 30% reduction in the risk of PD or 
death. The PFS on the Vd control arm was similar to that reported in recent studies.

Additional Sensitivity Analyses and Supportive Analyses for primary endpoint-PFS 
Modifications of the primary PFS endpoint analysis were used for sensitivity analyses. 
A sensitivity analysis in which patients with PD or death after 2 or more missed visits were censored was 
performed, confirming the results from the primary analysis. The median PFS was 15.21 months (95%

CI: 11.76, NE) in the SVd arm and 9.46 months (95% CI: 8.11, 10.78) in the Vd arm (stratified log-
rank test: p=0.0042) 
Similar improvement in PFS was noted when patients were not censored at treatment discontinuation: 
the  median  PFS  was  13.24  months  (95%  CI:  10.28,  NE)  in  the  SVd  arm  and  9.46  months  (95%  CI: 
8.11, 10.78) in the Vd arm (stratified log-rank test: 0.0086). 
When initiation of non-study antineoplastic therapy was also counted as an event, results similar to the 
results of the primary analysis were obtained: the median PFS was 13.24 months (95% CI: 10.28, NE) 
in  the  SVd  arm  and  9.43  months  (95%  CI:  7.62,  10.71)  in  the  Vd  arm  (stratified  log  rank  test: 
p=0.0097). 
Similar results were obtained when clinical progression (i.e., PD not confirmed by IRC) was also counted 
as an event: the median PFS was 13.93 months (95% CI: 11.73, NE) in the SVd arm and 9.46 months 
(95% CI: 8.11, 10.78) in the Vd arm (stratified logrank test: p=0.0075). When the date of IRC-confirmed 
PD at an unscheduled visit was changed to the next scheduled visit: the median PFS was 13.40 months 
(95% CI: 11.76, NE) in the SVd arm and 9.46 months (95% CI: 8.21, 10.78) in the Vd arm (stratified 
log-rank test: p=0.0069). If the confirmation of PD was based on the Investigator's assessment instead 
of the IRC's assessment, the median PFS was 13.93 months (95% CI: 11.73, NE) in the SVd arm and 
9.46 months (95% CI: 8.44, 11.89) in the Vd arm (stratified log-rank test: p=0.0171). 
The  improvement  in  PFS  in  the  SVd  arm  was  maintained  during  all  the  different  sensitivity  analyses. 
However, when treatment discontinuation for any reason was counted as a PFS event, there were no 
major differences between treatment arms: the median PFS was 6.70 months (95% CI: 5.75, 7.66) in 
the SVd arm and 6.97 months (95% CI: 5.78, 8.34) in the Vd arm (stratified log-rank test: p=0.3325).  
Importantly, the ORRs for patients who discontinued without reaching a PFS event were similar to the 
ORR in the entire SVd arm, and higher in the SVd arm (N=78, ORR=76.9%) as compared with the Vd 
arm (N=49, ORR=63.3%); these differences were similar to the overall ORRs in the SVd and Vd for the 
entire study.

Subgroup analysis 
Subgroup analyses indicated that the treatment effect on PFS was consistent regardless of age, gender, 
number  of  prior  lines  of  anti-MM  therapy,  stem  cell  transplant,  presence  of  a  high-risk  chromosomal 
abnormality, level of renal function, frail versus fit, and baseline ECOG PS.  
Importantly, marked differences were noted in patients without prior PI treatment (n=95), where 
there was a significant ~74% reduction (HR=0.2585; 95% CI, 0.1116-0.5988) in progression or death 
with SVd (median PFS not yet reached) versus Vd (median PFS: 9.69 months). 
In patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance: 30 to 60 mL/min), the median PFS was 
16.62 months (95% CI: 7.95, NE) in the SVd arm (n=53) versus 7.26 months (95% CI: 5.09, 14.13) in 
the Vd arm (n=60) (stratified log-rank test: p=0.0083). The hazard ratio was 0.4903 (95% CI: 0.2705, 
0.8889). 
The  subgroup  of  patients  with  creatinine  clearance  of  <30  mL/min  was  too  small  for  a  meaningful 
analysis (n=13 in total). 
Overall, the results of the subgroup analyses suggest that the prolongations of PFS demonstrated with 
SVd regimen compared with Vd in the overall study population was similar in all subgroups studied.

The primary analysis showed a higher ORR in the SVd arm than in the Vd arm based on IRC-determined 
ORR (i.e., the proportion of patients who achieved a partial response or better before IRC confirmed PD, 
initiated a new MM treatment or crossover).  
The ORR was 76.4% (95% CI: 69.8, 82.2) (149 of 195 patients) in the SVd arm and 62.3% (95% CI: 
55.3, 68.9) (129 of 207 patients) in the Vd arm. The stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test confirmed 
the statistical significance of the ORR improvement in the SVd arm over the Vd arm (odds ratio: 1.9626; 
95% CI; 1.2641, 3.0471; p=0.0012). 
The ≥VGPR rates were 44.6% and 32.4% (p=0.0082), and the rates of CR/sCR were 7.2%/9.7% and 
4.3%/6.3% in the SVd and Vd arms, respectively (one-sided p=0.0373 for rates of CR or sCR between 
the  SVd  and  Vd  arms).  Importantly,  9  of  33  patients  with  sCR  or  CR  from  the  SVd  arm  and  8  of  22 
patients with sCR or CR from the Vd arm were assessed as MRD negative.

Additional Sensitivity Analyses and Supportive Analyses for ORR 
A sensitivity analysis that considered the patients who did not complete at least 2 scheduled post- 
C1D1 MM evaluations as non-responders led to similar results as the above analysis. 
ORRs based on Investigator assessments instead of IRC assessments were also similar: the stratified 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test showed that the ORR based on Investigator assessments was markedly 
higher in the SVd arm (76.9%) than in the Vd arm (63.8%) in the Vd arm (odds ratio: 1.8799; 95% 
CI; 1.2075, 2.9265; p=0.0023). 
Of note, only 1 patient (0.5%) in the SVd arm had PD as their best response, as compared with 10 
patients (4.8%) in the Vd arm.  
Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses demonstrate that ORR differences between the SVd arm compared to the Vd arm in 
the overall study population was similar in all subgroups studied.

In the primary analysis, VGPR, CR, or sCR was observed in 87 (44.6%) of 195 patients from the SVd 
arm and 67 (32.4%) of 207 patients from the Vd arm (odds ratio: 1.6594; 95% CI: 1.0993, 2.5049; 
p=0.0082; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test [SVd arm versus Vd arm]). 
Overall, the results of the subgroup analyses suggest that the increased ≥VGPR rates demonstrated with 
SVd compared with Vd in the overall study population were similar in all subgroups studied. 
There were no changes in the ≥VGPR rate in the updated analysis compared to the primary analysis. 
A VGPR, CR, or sCR was observed in 87 (44.6%) of 195 patients from the SVd arm and 67 (32.4%) of

Overall Survival 
Median OS was not reached for SVd at the time of the primary analysis, with 24.1% to 30.0% of death 
events having occurred in the SVd and Vd arms, respectively. At a median follow-up of 17.5 months, 
the median OS for patients in the Vd arm was 24.97 months (95% CI: 23.49, NE). At a median follow-
up of 17.3 months, the median OS for patients in the SVd arm was not reached.  
Seventy-four (36%) patients from the Vd arm crossed over after confirmed PD to receive a regimen that 
included selinexor (SVdX or SdX).

With a longer follow-up, at the time of the updated analysis (15 Feb 2021), the median OS was 36.67 
(95% CI: 30.19, NE) months in the SVd arm and 32.76 (95 CI: 27.83, NE) months in the Vd arm, what 
is translated to a median improvement of approximately 4 months in patients treated with selinexor.  
Futher updated OS data, with a data cut-off of 22 March 2022, were provided. As of 22 March 2022, 
there were a total of 74 (37.9%) and 83 (40.1%) deaths in the SVd and Vd arms, respectively. Based 
on these data, OS was overall consistent with the previous data cut and there was no detrimental 
effect of SVd in terms of OS. Bearing in mind that cross-over was allowed in the BOSTON study,a 2-
stage estimation method accounting for cross-over effect on OS was conducted with the 22 March 
2022 data cut, reporting a switch-adjusted HR for OS of 0.88 (95%C CI: 0.64, 1.22).

Kaplan-Meier Curve of Overall Survival by Treatment Arm for the Intent-to-
Treat Population (15 February 2021 and 22 March 2022) 
Overall Survival Sensitivity Analysis 
Of the 207 Vd-treated patients in the ITT population, 111 (53.6%) patients had PD.  
Of these patients who had PD, 74 (66.7%) patients crossed over to SVdX or SdX.  
The median duration from PD to cross over was 43 days with 97.3% switching within 4 months. A switch-
adjusted HR based on the two-stage estimation method (Latimer 2017, Latimer 2018) comparing overall 
survival  on  SVd  versus  Vd  at  any  point  in  the  study  was  0.77  (95%  CI:  0.52,  1.14).  On  average, 
treatment with SVd over the trial produced an estimated approximately 23% lower risk of death. The 
27-month survival rate based on Kaplan-Meier estimates was 45% and 63% for the Vd arm and SVd 
arm, respectively. 
The two-stage estimation method proceeded by using the PD time point as a secondary baseline for all 
Vd-treated patients and comparing post-progression survival in the Vd arm switchers and non-switchers 
based on a Weibull accelerated failure time model, adjusting for prognostic characteristics measured at 
baseline and the time of PD. The accelerated failure time model adjusted for age at enrollment (centered 
at the mean), number of ongoing medical history terms, number of adverse events of special interest, 
R-ISS stage, time of progression, physician experience with SVd (measured with number of SVd patient 
in a site), ECOG score, prior exposure, sensory component of EORTC QLQ-CIPN20, and number of prior 
anti-MM  regimens.  The  acceleration  factor  from  this  model  was  used  to  adjust  the  observed  survival 
times in Vdswitching patients to obtain counterfactual survival times. 
A Cox proportional hazards regression model (stratified by R-ISS stage, prior PI therapy, and number of 
prior anti-MM regimens) was then fitted to the observed SVd arm survival times and the counterfactual 
Vd  arm  survival  times to estimate  a  treatment  switch-adjusted  HR.  The  standard  error  of  the log  HR 
estimates  was  obtained  from  2,000  bootstrap  samples;  hence,  CI  and  p-value  were  based  on  a  t-
distribution using normal distribution theory method with the bootstrapped standard error. The possible 
artificial reduction of survival times when the goal of treatment is to extend survival times precluded re-

censoring in the sensitivity analysis using a two-stage estimation method. Likewise, beside the relatively 
small number of deaths and sample size, the artificial censoring of death when deaths are, in fact, known 
to have occurred favored a two-stage estimation method over inverse probability of censoring weight 
(IPCW; Robins 2000, Herman 2001) in the present context. 
A switch-adjusted HR based on IPCW with weights trimmed at the 99th percentile was 0.86 (95% CI: 
0.53, 1.40). The variables included in the model for IPCW were selected to cover domains of disease 
stage, functions, and tolerability. 
OS in patients with prior SCT 
Median OS (mOS; months) in the SVd arm was not significantly different in patients with a prior SCT 
(36.67; 95% CI: 31.74, NE) than those without a prior SCT (31.41; 95% CI: 26.68, NE) (table 28).

Vd arm. The median DOR in patients with confirmed PR or better, was 17.3 months (95% CI: 12.55, 
26.25) in the SVd arm and 12.9 months (95% CI: 9.26, 15.77) in the Vd arm (p=0.1103, stratified

Time to Next Treatment 
A total of 69 (35.4%) patients in the SVd arm and 116 (56.0%) patients in the Vd arm received a new 
anti-MM treatment.

Quality of Life-Primary Analysis 
For the primary analysis, patient-reported PN was assessed using the EORTC-QLQ-CIPN20 tool. Baseline 
CIPN20 severity was similar between the SVd and Vd arms in the ITT population on the sensory, motor, 
and autonomic symptom scales. Over the course of the study, a lower rate of change from baseline score 
was observed in the SVd arm compared with the Vd arm for the sensory scale (p=0.0038, indicating a 
lower sensory symptom burden) while scores were similar in both arms for the motor and autonomic 
scales. 
For  sensory  PN,  patients  in  the  Vd  arm  consistently  showed  higher  symptom  scores  compared  with 
patients in the SVd arm. These differences were most pronounced during the first 169 days of the study 
when patients in the Vd arm were receiving BIW bortezomib compared with QW in the SVd arm. Similarly, 
based  on  the  analysis  of  covariance  model  (adjusted  for  prior  PI  therapies,  number  of  prior  anti-MM 
regimens, R-ISS stage at screening, and baseline value of the subscale score), the adjusted mean change 
from baseline in EORTC QLQ CIPN20 scores at the target day (Day 106) was significantly lower in the 
SVd arm than in the Vd arm for sensory symptom scores (estimated mean treatment difference: 3.56; 
95% CI: 6.99, 0.12; p=0.0423). 
Health-related  QoL  domains  of  the  EORTC-QLQ-C30  were  included  as  exploratory  analyses.  At 
baseline,  the  measures  were  similar  across  the  SVd  and  Vd  arms.  Over  time,  scores  of  the  cognitive 
domain were lower for the SVd arm than the Vd arm (indicating worse functioning) whereas scores in 
the  SVd  arm  were  higher  for  the  social  domain  (indicating  improved  functioning)  while  no  major 
differences were observed for other functional domains. 
For  the  symptom  domains  of  the  EORTC-QLQ-C30,  over  time,  scores  in  the  SVd  arm  were  higher 
(indicating worse symptoms) compared with the Vd arm for nausea/vomiting and decreased appetite. 
While fatigue scores in the SVd and Vd arms were similar for the first 3 months of treatment, scores 
trended  higher  (indicating  worse  symptoms)  in  the  SVd  arm  over  subsequent  cycles  of  treatment. 
Constipation scores for the SVd arm were also higher (indicating worse symptoms) compared with the 
Vd arm during the majority of the study. However, pain scores in the SVd arm were lower (indicating 
improved symptoms) compared with the Vd arm over the course of the study.  
The initial reductions in pain scores observed during the first 60 days of the study (in both arms) are 
likely due to control of MM; this effect persisted in the SVd arm during the course of the study. No major 
differences were observed for other symptom domains. 
Response in Patients with Cytogenetic Abnormalities 
Nearly half of the patients had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities; 97 patients (49.7%) in the SVd arm 
and 95 patients (45.9%) in the Vd arm.  
The median PFS in patients with any high-risk cytogenetic abnormality was 12.91 months on SVd versus 
8.15  months  on  Vd  (one-sided  p-value=0.0192).  Similarly,  the  ORRs  were  77.3%  and  55.8%, 
respectively. The median OS was not reached for the SVd arm and was 23.5 months for the Vd arm. 
Among patients with del[17p], the median PFS was 12.22 months (95% CI: 5.62, NE) in the SVd arm 
(n=21) compared to 5.91 months (95% CI: 2.04, 11.89) in the Vd arm (n=16), for a HR of 0.3762 (one-
sided p-value=0.0080).

Title:  
A phase 3 randomized, controlled, open-label study of selinexor, bortezomib, and 
dexamethasone (SVd) versus bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with relapsed 
or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) 
Study identifier 
KCP-330-023/ BOSTON  
EudraCT: 2016-003957-14 
Design 
The BOSTON study is a Phase 3, 2-arm, global, randomized, active comparator-
controlled, open-label, multicenter study which compared the efficacy, safety 
and Health Related-Quality of Life of SVd versus  Vd in adult patients with 
RRMM who had received 1 to 3 prior anti-MM regimens. 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 allocation, as follows: 
• SVd arm: selinexor (QW) + SC bortezomib (QW) + dexamethasone. 
• Vd arm: SC bortezomib (Cycles 1-8 BIW, Cycles ≥9 QW) dexamethasone. 
Randomization was stratified based on: 
• Prior PI therapies (Yes or No). 
• Number of prior anti-MM regimens (1 versus >1). 
• Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) stage at study entry based 
on screening results (R-ISS Stage III versus R-ISS Stage I or II) (Palumbo 
2016).  
Following confirmation of PD by the IRC, patients who received Vd were 
allowed to cross over to receive either SVd (i.e., the SVdX treatment arm) or 
selinexor + low-dose dexamethasone (i.e., the SdX treatment arm) for those 
patients who developed intolerance to bortezomib. 
Duration of main phase: 
Study  treatment  (SVd,  Vd,  or  crossover)  was 
continued until PD was confirmed by the IRC, 
Investigator  or  patient  decision  to  discontinue 
study 
treatment,  pregnancy,  unacceptable 
adverse  events  (AEs)  or  toxicity  that  could  not 
be  managed  by  supportive  care,  withdrawal  of 
consent, death, or Sponsor decision to terminate 
the study.

Primary Analysis 
The  ITT  population  consisted  of  all  patients  who  are  randomized  to  study 
treatment, regardless of whether or not they receive study treatment. The ITT 
population  included  patients  who  have  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to 
toxicity or PD and patients who have died from any cause. This population has 
been  used  for  primary  analyses  of  efficacy.  Patients  were  analyzed  in  the 
treatment  arm  to  which  they  were  randomized  and  strata  assignment  at  the 
time of randomization

Supportive studies 
The supportive STOMP study Arm 2 has been described in section 4.4.1. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH is submitting a Grouped Type II /Type IB variation for selinexor (Nexpovio).  
The Type IB variation relates to the introduction of a new pack size (8 tablets per pack) for added 
convenience to patients for dose modification in the new intended treatment setting. 
The Type II variation is aimed at extending the indication for Nexpovio to be used:  
“in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple 
myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy”.  
In addition, results from the pivotal study in support of this application are intended to fulfil the 
Specific Obligation (SOB) in the context of the Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) of Nexpovio 
(selinexor) which was granted on 26 March 2021. 
This application is based on the efficacy results from the pivotal ongoing phase 3 KCP-330-023 
(BOSTON) study and supported by the Phase 1b/2 KCP-330-017 (STOMP) study.

Dose finding – Dose response study 
KCP-330-017  (STOMP)  study  is  a  multicenter,  multi-arm,  open-label,  clinical  study  with  a  Dose-
Escalation (Phase 1) and an Expansion (Phase 2) to independently assess the MTD/RP2D, safety, and 
efficacy  in  patients  with  either  newly  diagnosed  MM  or  previously  treated  MM.  The  study  includes  7 
treatment arms. 
Arm 2 of SVd (selinexor in combination with bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone) was one of the 
combinations evaluated in STOMP study in patients with relapsed or refractory MM who had received at 
least one prior line of therapy. The primary endpoint of the phase 1 part was to establish MTD and define 
the RP2D dose. The primary endpoints of the Phase 2 include overall response rate (ORR), DOR, and 
clinical benefit rate (CBR).  
Of the 42 patients treated on the SVd arm 40 patients were evaluable for efficacy. The ORR was 75% in 
patients with PI-nonrefractory MM (n = 20), while patients with PI-refractory MM (n= 20) had an ORR 
of 40%. As reported by the MAH, the PI-refractory population is a more pre-treated population (median 
of  6.5  previous  lines,  85%  of  patients  with  more  than  3  lines,  with  100%  of  patients  exposed  to 
lenalidomide  and  75%  of  refractory  to  lenalidomide  and/or  pomalidomide),  and  with  different 
characteristics from those proposed in the BOSTON study. Therefore, the “BOSTON-like” population is 
the  non-PI  refractory  population  and  results  in  this  subset  of  patients  guided  next  steps  of  the 
development. 
The RP2D of SVd in the STOMP study was established to be selinexor 100 mg QW and bortezomib 1.3 
mg/m2 QW plus dexamethasone 40 mg QW. Selinexor 100 mg QW showed a response rate similar to 
selinexor 80 mg BW with a lower cumulative dose and expected lower toxicity. The rationale for selecting 
this dose appears adequate also given the efficacy results reported in the “BOSTON-like” population (see 
above). 
Of note, as concomitant therapy all patients must receive 5-HT3 antagonists (ondansetron or equivalent) 
during selinexor treatment. Additionally, it has been reported by the MAH that supportive measures for 
optimal  medical  care  should  be  provided  as  appetite  stimulants  (megestrol  acetate),  centrally  acting 
agents and NK1R antagonist, given the fact that the main side effects have been primarily related to 
anorexia  with  poor  caloric  and  fluid  intake,  fatigue,  and  nausea.  This  point  raises  concerns  about 
tolerability of the drug. 
Main clinical study  
Design and conduct  
The KCP-330-023 (BOSTON) study is a confirmatory phase 3, open-label, 2-arm, randomized, active 
comparator-controlled,  multicenter  study  that  compares  the  efficacy  and  health-related  quality  of  life 
(HR-QoL)  and  assesses  the  safety  of  selinexor  plus  bortezomib  plus  low-dose  dexamethasone  (SVd) 
versus bortezomib plus low-dose dexamethasone (Vd) in adult patients with RRMM who have received 1 
to 3 prior anti-MM regimens.  
As noted above the dose/regimen of SVd was selected on the basis of results from the phase 2 study 
STOMP,  i.e.  the  observed  activity  of  the  combination  and  safety  and  tolerability  considerations.  This 
regimen  allows  patients  in  the  experimental  arm  to  receive  approximately  40%  less  bortezomib  and 
approximately 25% less dexamethasone than patients in the Vd arm since Vd is given at different dose 
in the experimental and control arms of the BOSTON study. The design is considered acceptable, but it 
is  indeed  not  a  classical  add-on  study  with  the  same  backbone  in  both  treatments’  arms,  therefore 
preventing blinding which is a drawback of the current design.  
The Vd regimen is still an acceptable option for patients with RRMM, although other options (such as 
lenalidomide  +  dexamethasone  or  carfilzomib  +  lenalidomide  +  dexamethasone  or  elotuzumab  + 
Table 32. Summary of Efficacy for trial KCP-330-023 (BOSTON Study)

lenalidomide + dexamethasone) were approved for patients who have received at least one prior line of 
therapy,  as  well  as  pomalidomide  +  dexamethasone  for  those  who  have  received  at  least  two  prior 
therapies, when the BOSTON study was planned. Indeed, although the control arm in the BOSTON study 
is an accepted standard of care, the room for improvement of response of a patient previously exposed 
to  bortezomib,  alone  or  in  combination  in  a  previous  first  line,  appears  limited  with  the  proposed 
combination and in fact Vd is usually considered as an option in later lines of treatment. In this context, 
the control arm in the BOSTON study can be considered, at present, as a suboptimal treatment option 
in the intended treatment setting. This having said it is acknowledged that the treatment landscape for 
MM patients is evolving quickly and demonstration of superiority vs. the proposed control arm should in 
principle suffice for regulatory approval.  
A  total  of  402  patients  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  either  SVd  (n=195)  or  Vd  (n=207).  Three 
hundred ninety-nine subjects (SVd: 195, Vd: 204) received study treatment. At the time of the clinical 
cut-off date of 18 Feb 2020, 19% SVd subjects and 17.6% of Vd subjects were still on study treatment. 
Randomization was stratified by prior PI therapy (yes or no), number of prior anti-MM regimens (1 versus 
>1), and disease severity at study entry (based on the revised International Staging System [R-ISS]; 
Stage III versus Stage I or II). The 1:1 randomisation ratio is agreed, and the proposed stratification 
factors  are  considered  acceptable  as  they  represent  basal  characteristics  with  well-known  potential 
impact on clinical responses. Furthermore, taking into account that both SVd and Vd are expected to 
rely on conserved sensitivity to bortezomib, stratification based on prior exposure to PI is agreed. Region 
2 guarantees representation of the target population in the EU. 
Following  confirmation  of  progressive  disease  (PD)  by  the  Independent  Review  Committee  (IRC), 
patients who received Vd were allowed to cross over to receive either SVd (i.e. the SVdX treatment arm) 
or  selinexor  and  low-dose  dexamethasone  (i.e.  the  SdX  treatment  arm)  for  those  patients  who  were 
intolerant to bortezomib. The possibility offered to patients in the Vd arm to crossover to SVd appears 
reasonable also considering that there are some (preliminary) clinical data suggesting that selinexor is 
able to restore sensitivity to bortezomib. This was in fact agreed at the time when SA was sought. The 
generation of potential valuable information on the activity of SVd in patients resistant to bortezomib 
has however to be weighed against the potential impact of the crossover on the assessment of long-
term time-dependent endpoints, especially OS which is a secondary endpoint in the BOSTON study. As 
discussed also during the SA, precise estimates of long-term OS in the targeted early stage of MM (1-3 
prior lines) are not required for approval but rather the absence of a detrimental effect. This is so in view 
of  the  long-expected  survival  after  progression.  In  this  regard  the  MAH  has  conducted  several  OS 
sentivity  analyses  to  account  for  the  crossover.  Further,  the  number  of  patients  who  crossed  over  is 
limited, and therefore not expected to have a major impact on the results of the study. The proposed 
rules for prevention of premature cross over are overall supported. 
The MAH states that if PD is suspected but the IRC does not confirm PD, patients will either remain on 
study treatment until PD is confirmed by the IRC or discontinue study treatment, complete the End of 
Treatment (EoT) Visit, and be followed for survival. Upon request the MAH provided information that for 
the primary analysis, 3 patients (SVd n=2; Vd n=1) had only one progression as the last MM assessment 
and that at the time of the DCO date for the updated analysis, 5 patients (SVd n=3; Vd n= 2) had only 
1 progression as the last MM assessment. The MAH confirmed that these eight patients were not counted 
as PFS events but censored.  
The target population of the study is considered well represented. Overall, the proposed inclusion and 
exclusion  criteria  are  supported.  In  the  study  patients  were  included  based  on  investigator-based 
evidence of PD and had confirmed PD, i.e. they were required to have confirmed PD on or after their 
most recent regimen based on the Investigator’s assessment (Inclusion Criterion #3).

Regarding patient demographics, the median ages of the patients in BOSTON were 66 and 67 years in 
the SVd and Vd arms, respectively. The majority of the patients were 65 years of age or older (SVd, 
55.9%;  Vd,  63.8%)  and  ~20%  were  ≥75  years  of  age.  More  males  were  enrolled  in  the  study  than 
females  (males:  SVd,  59.0%;  Vd,  55.6%)  and  the  race  was  predominantly  white  (SVd,  82.6%;  Vd, 
79.7%). 
Patients with plasma cell leukemia, associated AL amyloidosis, CNS involvement or POEMS syndrome 
were excluded from trial participation to reduce heterogeneity. This has been reflected in the SmPC. 
Approximately 50% of the patients had received 1 prior anti-MM therapy (SVd: 50.8%; Vd: 47.8%) with 
one-third having 2 prior regimens, and the remainder having 3 prior regimens for MM.  
A slightly higher previous exposure to bortezomib-dexamethasone is reported in the Vd arm, although 
overall, bortezomib previous exposure was similar in both treatment arms. Bortezomib–refractoriness 
was numerically slightly higher in the Vd treatment arm, as well as Thalidomide refractoriness and IMiD 
refractoriness in general. Median previous treatment lines were 2 in the Vd arm, whereas in the SVd arm 
median  previous  lines  of  treatment  was  1.The  reported  differences  are  generally  small,  and  it  is  not 
considered that they can have a significant impact on the results. 
Regarding refractoriness, bortezomib refractory patients were excluded. The following was required for 
patients  previously  treated  with  bortezomib  (inclusion  criteria):“Best  response  achieved  with  prior 
bortezomib at any time was ≥PR and with the last PI therapy (alone or in combination) was ≥PR AND 
participant did not discontinue bortezomib due to Grade ≥3-related toxicity AND must have had at least 
a  6-month  PI-treatment-free  interval  prior  to  C1D1  of  study  treatment.”  All  patients  in  the  BOSTON 
study who had achieved a response to lines of prior therapy that included bortezomib had been treated 
with that therapy for at least 60 days and/or achieved a response to a bortezomib-containing therapy 
that lasted for >60 days, with except one patient. This patient was previously exposed to bortezomib 
and  achieved  less  that  PR.  However,  bortezomib  exposure  was  too  short  to  consider  refractoriness. 
Additionally, this patient was treated in the Vd arm achieving a VGPR, what is understood as bortezomib 
sensitivity. 
Several patients in the BOSTON study received stem cell transplantation (SCT). It is assumed that only 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has been considered, as patients are in earlier lines of therapy. 
However,  the  uncertainty surrounding the  allogeneic  SCT  and  the  impact  it  may  have  on  subsequent 
treatments should be taken into account. In the 8 patients in whom the type of transplant is unknown, 
it cannot be assumed, in the absence of indirect data that would suggest so, that it was an autologous 
transplant. The MAH has provided additional information on these 8 patients with "unspecified type of 
transplant”, in terms of previous therapies and subsequent clinical outcomes. As per the reported data, 
an autologous STC transplant is the most likely procedure conducted in these patients. One out of these 
8 patients achieved a PR after receiving selinexor in combination. 
According to the current ESMO guideline, in MM for fit newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients, aged 70 
years, without comorbidities, induction followed by high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT) and lenalidomide maintenance is the recommended treatment. In this context, 
it is surprising that only 39% of the included patients have received an ASCT before entering the study, 
given  that  this  treatment  option  is  considered  as  a  standard  of  care  in  newly  diagnosed  MM  (NDMM) 
patients in many countries. The MAH reported that 33% of patients were >70 years old at enrolment (at 
diagnosis 24% of patients were >70 years old) and would generally not be considered for ASCT per the 
ESMO guidelines. The proportion of patients who received a previous transplant was higher in the study 
arm (SVd) than in the control arm (Vd). No relevant differences in efficacy among the two groups, with 
and without prior SCT, were however reported.

In the SVd arm of the supportive study STOMP 7 out of 12 patients with PI-refractory MM responded 
(ORR 58%). These patients with PI-refractory MM are similar to the ones treated in the Vd Arm of the 
BOSTON study who will be given the opportunity to cross over to SVd. Since preliminary clinical data 
suggest that selinexor is able to restore sensitivity to bortezomib, this is acceptable and could provide 
additional valuable information on the activity of SVd in patients resistant to bortezomib.  
As reported by the MAH, 63 patients from the Vd arm crossed-over to SVdX (regarding ITT population 
111/207 Vd treated patients were reported as PD and 74 crossed-over: 11 crossed to SdX and 63 to 
SVdX). The ORR in these 63 patients under SVdX was 19% (3 patients (4.8%) achieved VGPR and 9 
patients  (14.3%)  achieved  a  PR).  Nine  (14.3%)  patients  achieved  a  MR,  30  patients  (47.6%)  SD,  5 
patients (7.9%) showed PD, and 7 patients (11.1%) were not evaluable. Median PFS in these 63 patients 
was 3.91 months (95% CI: 3.48 to 6.93). As of the database cut-off date (14 February 2021) the median 
(95% CI) duration of response in the SVdX population was 5.78 months (4.34, NE). Of the 11 patients 
in  the  SdX  population,  1  (9.1%)  patient  achieved  a  very  good  partial  response,  8  (72.7%)  patients 
achieved stable disease, 1 (9.1%) patient had progressive disease (PD), and 1 patient’s response was 
non-evaluable.  Based  on  the  IRC  assessment,  at  the  time  of  the  data  cut-off  date,  from  these  SdX 
treated patients 6 patients had events, 5 (45.5%) had PD and 1 (9.1%) patient died. The median (95% 
CI) PFS was 2.33 months (2.30, non-evaluable)    
The main hypothesis of the BOSTON study is of superiority of SVd compared with Vd for the primary 
efficacy endpoint  progression  free  survival  (PFS), based  on  IRC  assessment.  Disease  response has 
been assessed according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria for MM 
(Kumar 2016). The BOSTON study was originally designed with PFS and ORR as co-primary endpoints. 
At the time when scientific advice was sought, the MAH was however discouraged to include ORR as co-
primary endpoint in the context of such an early stage of relapse (1-3 prior therapies, no refractoriness 
to bortezomib), when relatively high response rates are still expected, questioning the relative value of 
that endpoint. Further, the MAH was discouraged to use ORR results for a potential conditional approval, 
since ORR is not currently recognized as a reliable surrogate for PFS (or OS) in RRMM, and the actual 
value of endpoints based on response rates to define clinical benefit in the absence of long-term data is 
still  debated.  PFS  was  recommended  as  the  primary  endpoint,  consistent  with  all  recent  approvals  in 
MM.  In  this  regard,  the  design  was  modified  (Protocol  Version  4.0  dated  17  August  2018)  and  PFS 
became the single primary endpoint. ORR was moved to a secondary endpoint. 
Secondary objectives included to compare the 2 arms in terms of overall response rate (ORR) (≥partial 
response [PR]), as well as number of patients achieving ≥ very good partial response (VGPR), ≥ complete 
response (CR) or minimal residual disease (MRD) negative (for patients who achieve CR or stringent CR 
[sCR].  An  additional  secondary  objective  was  to  compare  the  incidence  of  any  Grade  ≥2  peripheral 
neuropathy events between the two arms (see safety section). Other secondary endpoints include overall 
survival (OS), duration of response (DOR) and time to next treatment (TTNT). 
A  number  of  (major)  amendments  were  made  to  the  protocol  including  changes  in  the  primary 
endpoint(s),  number  of  events  required  for  the  analyses  (final  and  interim;  see  below),  definition  of 
response, etc. These revisions together with the late finalization of the SAP including a major change 
affecting the primary efficacy analysis in the context of open-label study called into question the integrity 
of  the  study.  To  address  these  concerns  the  MAH  presented  a  detailed  description  on  how  the  data 
integrity  was  maintained  from  the  beginning  of  the  trial  until  the  data  cut-off  when  the  pre-planned 
second IA for efficacy was changed into the final analysis, at a very late stage. Apparently, the main 
reason to have performed this major change was due to predictions that the 267 PFS events planned 
would  not  be  achieved  in  a  reasonable  period  of  time.  In  addition,  the  MAH  presented  relevant 
information  on  a  calendar  time  basis  from  the  beginning  of  the  trial,  including  amendments  in  the 
protocol,  SAP  and  interactions  with  the  DSMB.  The  justification  of  the  MAH  was  acknowleged  and  it 
appeared that they remained blinded to the results.

A  GCP  inspection  was  conducted as  proposed  by  the  CHMP,  bearing  in  mind  what  was  stated  in  the 
Integrated Inspection Report (IIR) of the routine GCP inspection requested by the CHMP at the time of 
initial MAA (GCP/2019/001); see section 4.1.4. The IIR from this new inspection was submitted on 17th 
March 2022. According to it, although certain measures had been implemented after the first inspection, 
which was performed at the time of the initial CMA application, critical findings in relation to the clinical 
conduct  and  management  of  the  trial  by  the  Sponsor  were  identified.  Based  on  these  several  critical 
findings, the inspectors could not confirm that trial data were reliable and had adequate quality to be 
used  in  support  of  the  applied  extension  of  the  indication  for  Nexpovio.  Importantly,  the  inspectors 
identified “a risk of potentially biased decisions been taken by potentially unblinded key personnel from 
the Cy and a risk of introducing bias on IRC members’ assessment”. This is of special relevance since 
the  primary  endpoint in the  BOSTON  trial  was  PFS  by  the  IRC.  At  the  time  of  the  primary  analysis  a 
statistically significant improvement in PFS was observed (see below). In addition, a sensitivity analysis, 
where  the  confirmation  of  PD  was  based  on  the  investigator's  assessment  instead  of  the  IRC's 
assessment, was conducted and showed consistent results, i.e. median PFS was 13.93 months (95% CI: 
11.73, NE) in the SVd arm and 9.46 months (95% CI: 8.44, 11.89) in the Vd arm; HR 0.73 (95% CI: 
0.55, 0.98). This is reassuring. However, the BOSTON study is an open label study and concerns affecting 
the  assessment  of  the  primary  endpoint  of  PFS  by  IRC  could  be  expected  to  have  resulted  in  loss  of 
control of type I error questioning the robustness of the results. In this context, OS data (which was a 
secondary  endpoint  in  the  trial)  could  be  considered  of  special  relevance.  Reported  OS  results  in  the 
BOSTON study are included below, showing that  a detrimental effect of SVd in terms of OS does not 
seem likely, though still these data corresponded to 148 survival events (37%, n=402) (DCO 15 Feb 
2021).  In  the  context  of  the  reported  GCP  findings  a  further  update  of  OS  data  was  provided 
corresponding  to  157  survival  events  (DCO  22  March  2022).    Results  seem  overall  consistent  and 
supportive of benefit of selinexor in the claimed indication.  
Further, based on the criticality of the GCP findings identified, the MAH was requested to address them 
(by conducting a reanalysis of data used by the IRC to determine progression of the disease) and justify 
how  the  provided  data  can  be  considered  reliable  to  support  a  B/R  assessment.  The IRC  data  review 
consisted  of  two  parts  (Part  1  and  Part  2).  Part  1  was  comprised  of  the  assessment  from  each  IRC 
member while Part 2 was an adjudication meeting between the IRC members, to achieve consensus, in 
which  the  Sponsor  was  also  present  (according  to  the  MAH  for  administrative  and  training  purposes 
only). To address the identified concerns, the MAH has provided (instead of a full reanalysis) a sensitivity 
analysis of PFS results using only data from Part 1 of the ‘IRC data review’ without any information from 
Part 2 (adjudication meeting). According to this sensitivity analysis (of PFS assessment review), only for 
10  patients  (3  in the  SVd  arm  and  7  in  the  Vd  arm)  the  PFS  assessment  was  affected  (~2.5%  of  all 
randomised  patients  in  the  study).  Among  those  10  patients  in  whom  changes  in  the  adjudication 
affected PFS, a total of 5 (2 in the SVd arm and 3 in the Vd arm) had their PFS event/censoring status 
affected, which is balanced between the two treatment arms. Median PFS (95% CI) according to this 
analysis is of 13.93 (11.73, NE) vs. 9.46 (8.11, 10.87) months for the SVd and Vd arms, respectively. 
These results are in line with data reported in the primary efficacy analysis in the BOSTON study (see 
below).  The  reported  HR  (95%  CI)  for  this  sensitivity  analysis,  i.e.  0.7058  (0.5303,  0.9395),  is  also 
consistent  with  that  of  the  primary  analysis.  Taking  all  these  into  account  and  considering  that  PFS 
results according to the investigator are also consistent, the reported PFS data can be considered reliable 
to support B/R assessment.  
Statistical aspects  
There were 3 versions of the SAP (Version 1.0 dated 15 August 2018, Version 2.0 dated 30 September 
2019, and Version 3.0 dated 24 February 2020).  
Table 32. Summary of Efficacy for trial KCP-330-023 (BOSTON Study)  
EMA/620277/2022  
Page 90/151 
 
 
 
 
 
Two interim analyses were planned with different objectives. The first (unblinded) interim analysis (IA) 
was conducted to assess the conditional power at the time when approximately 30% PFS events had 
been achieved to consider if a sample size re-estimation was necessary using the CHW method (Cui et 
al., 1999). This analysis was conducted with data cut of 21 Jan 2019 after 113 events were accrued. On 
21 Feb 2019 the DSMB met and recommended continuing the study with no sample size adjustment and 
no change to the safety monitoring.  
A second IA was planned after approximately 75% of PFS events had occurred that would have allowed 
for a conclusion of efficacy or to stop for futility. The MAH planned to use the Lan DeMets alpha spending 
function  with  the  O’Brien-Fleming  boundary.  However,  the  MAH  later  decided  to  change  the  original 
design and to consider this second IA as the final efficacy analysis “no matter the outcome is positive or 
not”. The MAH did not discuss their proposal with any regulatory Agency but instead notes that the DSMB 
agreed. Because of this decision the testing of the primary efficacy endpoint was done using all one-
sided alpha of 0.025 instead of the corresponding level of alpha using the spending function originally 
proposed. 
The decision to change the second IA into the final analysis using the full level of alpha was triggered at 
a very late stage. In fact, this change was included in an updated statistical analysis plan (Version 4.0) 
dated 24 Feb 2020 (see above), 6 days after the data cut-off for the primary efficacy endpoint (18 Feb 
2020). To justify the change the MAH argues that there were concerns that the trial was not going to 
reach the planned 267 events, and that an extended period of time would have been needed to accrue 
additional PFS events with minimal gain in power. The provided justification was not entirely followed 
since a total of 204 PFS events were achieved at the time of submission (76.40% of planned events) 
and  in  the  updated  primary  analysis  one  year  later,  a  total  of  229  of  PFS  events  had  been  achieved 
(85.76% of planned events).  
As stated above, considering the open-label design of the trial it was not possible to exclude that these 
changes were partially driven by data and therefore no formal adjustment for inference would be feasible 
translating into lack of type I error control. For that reason, and in order to assess the robustness of the 
results, the MAH was requested to submit the analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint considering the 
corresponding  alpha  value  using  the  Lan  DeMets  alpha  spending  function  with  the  O’Brien-Fleming 
boundary as initially proposed (pre-planned IA2). Using the alpha spending function as initially planned, 
the boundary p-value would have been 0.0103 instead of the 0.025 used for the primary efficacy analysis 
and still the results are statistically significant.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
All  efficacy  analyses  were  conducted  using  the  ITT  population;  all  tests  (log-rank  tests,  Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel tests) were one-sided. 
Updated  data  as  of  15  Feb  2021  cut-off  date  (i.e.  from  an  additional  year  of  follow-up)  were  also 
submitted by the MAH and included updated results for the primary endpoint, key secondary endpoints, 
and safety data: cumulative PFS, DOR, OS, ORR, AEs, SAEs, AECIs, and deaths. 
Primary endpoint 
The BOSTON study met its primary endpoint. A statistically significant improvement in median PFS in 
the SVd arm (13.93 months) compared with the Vd arm (9.46 months; p=0.0075; HR, 0.70; 95% CI: 
0.5279-0.9335) was reported at a median overall follow-up of 13.17 and 16.53 months for the SVd and 
Vd  arms,  respectively.  The  results  were  generally  consistent  across  multiple  sensitivity  analyses 
(including according to EMA censoring rules) and across pre-specified subgroups by relevant patient and 
disease  characteristics,  including  regardless  of  prior  therapeutic  regimens.  Results  from  the  updated 
analysis  were  also  consistent.  However,  it  is  noted  that  the  median  follow-up  for  Vd  in  the  updated 
analysis is 24.48 (21.16- 29.17) months, which is 11 months longer (almost double) than that reported 
Table 32. Summary of Efficacy for trial KCP-330-023 (BOSTON Study)  
EMA/620277/2022  
Page 91/151 
 
 
 
for the SVd arm of 13.47 (10.64-24.87) months, with a wider range. Of note, patients were not always 
followed after treatment discontinuation, but only when they “were willing to continue survival follow-
up, still alive, not lost to follow-up and have not discontinued from the study”. As reported by the MAH, 
the  SVd  arm  had  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  censored  in  PFS  analysis  compared  to  the  Vd  arm, 
explaining why the estimated median follow-up time using the reverse KM method is shorter for SVd. 
Secondary endpoints  
Among the key secondary endpoints, a statistically significant improvement in ORR from 62.3% (95%CI: 
55.3, 68.9) in the Vd arm to 76.4% (95%CI: 69.8, 82.2) in the SVd arm (p=0.0012) was reported. The 
rate  of  ≥VGPR  improved  from  32.4%  in  the  Vd  arm  to  44.6% in  the  SVd  arm.  In  terms  of  ORR,  the 
results  observed  in  the  updated  analysis  were  consistent  with  the  previously  reported  in  the  primary 
analysis. It has been reported that 9 of 33 patients (27%) with sCR or CR from the SVd arm and 8 of 22 
patients (36%) with sCR or CR from the Vd arm were assessed as MRD negative. These data suggest 
that  no  deeper  responses  are  achieved  in  patients  treated  with  selinexor,  with  MRD  negativity 
percentages lower in the SVd arm. 
The median DOR according to the primary analysis were 20.3 (95% CI: 12.55, NE) months in the SVd 
arm and 12.9 (95% CI: 9.26, 15.77) months in the Vd arm. In the updated analysis, median DOR has 
been reported as 17.3 months (95% CI: 12.55, 26.25) in the SVd arm and 12.9 months (95% CI: 9.26, 
15.77) in the Vd arm. The MAH was requested to submit a further update of the DoR results and it was 
confirmed that the median DOR remained the same as of 01 December 2021. 
A clinically significant increase in the TTNT was achieved with the proposed SVd regimen. The median 
TTNT in the SVd arm was 16.1 months (95% CI: 13.9, NE) compared to 10.8 months (95% CI: 9.8, 
13.4) in the Vd arm. 
Median  OS  was  not  reached  for  SVd  at  a  median  follow-up  of  17.3  months  (primary  analysis).  The 
median OS for patients in the Vd arm was 24.97 months (95% CI: 23.49, NE). In the updated efficacy 
analysis at a median follow-up of 28.71 months, the median OS was 36.67 months (95% CI: 30.19, NE) 
for SVd compared to 32.76 months (95% CI: 27.83, NE) in the Vd arm; HR=0.88 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.22). 
At that time, data were immature but a detrimental effect of SVd in terms of OS did not seem likely also 
bearing in mind that cross-over was allowed in the BOSTON study. As already stated, further OS data 
were provided during the procedure with a median follow-up of 33.6 months in the SVd arm and 33.84 
months in the Vd arm, which remained overall consistent with the previous data submitted (HR 0.93; 
95% CI: 0.67, 1.27).

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Treatment with the (once weekly) combination of selinexor with bortezomib and dexamethasone tested 
in the BOSTON study (SVd) leads to a significant improvement in median PFS compared to the standard 
(BIW) Vd regimen in the targeted patient population, i.e. adult patients with MM who have received at 
least  one  prior  therapy.  This  benefit  in  terms  of  PFS  is  supported  by  several  secondary  endpoints. 
Importantly, no evidence of detrimental effect on survival has been observed also considering that cross 
over, to either SVd or Sd, was allowed in the trial.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The primary study supporting this Type II Variation is the Phase 3 confirmatory Study KCP-330-023 
(BOSTON), in which adult patients with MM who had received 1 to 3 prior MM regimens were randomized 
1:1  to  receive  QW  SVd  versus  BIW  Vd.  Of  note,  in  the  SVd  arm,  selinexor  and  bortezomib  are 
administered  QW,  whereas  in  the  Vd  arm,  bortezomib  is  administered  BIW  (consistent  with  the 
bortezomib  label)  with  both  regimens  given  with  low-dose  dexamethasone.  At  the  time  of  primary 
analysis  (18  Feb  2020),  BOSTON  was  ongoing  and  had  completed  enrolment  with  402  patients  (195 
randomized to SVd and 207 to Vd) of whom 203 remained on study (102 and 101 in the SVd and Vd 
arms,  respectively).  Updated  analysis  for  BOSTON  study  data  included  in  this  Type  II  Variation 
submission has a data cut-off date of 15 Feb 2021. 
In addition to this primary study, supporting safety data are provided from the preceding Phase 1b/2 
study (KCP-330-017) STOMP. The enrolment in the SVd arm (Arm 2) of STOMP was completed as of 
01 Sep 2019, with 42 patients dosed, of whom 2 remained on study.

Table 4 below provides a summary of the exposure to study treatment by treatment group for all 
patients in the safety population based on updated analysis. One additional patient, who crossed over 
from Vd arm to the SVdX arm in BOSTON study since primary analysis (N=300), was included in the 
All SVd population for the updated analysis (N=301). 
In the All SVd population, the median duration of exposure to SVd was 27.0 weeks (range: 1 to 
206), with a majority (56.1%) of patients receiving study treatment for ≥24 weeks, and 29.2% of 
patients receiving treatment for ≥48 weeks. 
In the BOSTON SVd arm, the median duration of exposure to study treatment was longer (30.0 weeks; 
range:  1  to  171),  the  proportion  of  patients  treated  for  ≥48  weeks  was  higher  (35.9%  of  patients), 
patients received a higher median number of doses (26.0), and a higher median total dose (2300.0 mg) 
of selinexor, than in the All SVd population. The longest duration of study treatment exposure was 171 
weeks. 
In the BOSTON Vd arm, the median duration of exposure to Vd was 32.0 weeks (range: 1 to 173), with 
a majority (60.3%) of patients receiving study treatment for ≥24 weeks, and 32.4% of patients receiving 
treatment for ≥48 weeks. The longest duration of study treatment exposure was 173 weeks.

Common adverse events 
Table 6: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events occurring in ≥10% of Patients in the All SVd 
Population, Safety Population – Updated analysis 
In the updated analysis, the most frequently reported TEAEs in the All SVd population and BOSTON 
SVd arm, all of which occurred at a higher frequency compared with the BOSTON Vd arm, were 
thrombocytopenia (58.5% and 62.1%, respectively), compared with 27.5% in BOSTON Vd arm; 
nausea (49.8% and 50.3%), compared with 10.3% in BOSTON Vd arm; fatigue (40.9% and 42.1%), 
compared with 18.1% in BOSTON Vd arm; anaemia (39.9% and 37.4%), compared with 23.5% in 
BOSTON Vd arm; decreased appetite (37.2% and 35.4%), compared with 5.4% in BOSTON Vd arm; 
and diarrhoea (34.6% and 33.3%) compared with 25.5% in BOSTON Vd arm. 
Peripheral neuropathy was the most frequently reported TEAE (48.5%) in the BOSTON Vd arm 
compared with the All SVd population (28.2%) and BOSTON SVd arm (33.3%). 
The incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs as of the updated analysis data cut was higher in the All SVd 
population (83.4%) and the BOSTON SVd arm (85.6%) compared with the BOSTON Vd arm (62.7%).

The most frequent (≥10.0%) Grade 3/4 TEAEs in the All SVd population compared with the BOSTON 
Vd arm were thrombocytopenia (39.9% and 17.6%, respectively), anaemia (20.3% and 9.8%, 
respectively), fatigue (11.3% and 1.0%, respectively), neutropenia (12.6% and 3.4%, respectively), 
and cataract (10.0% and 2.0%, respectively). Grade 3/4 TEAEs of PN were reported at a higher 
frequency in the BOSTON Vd arm compared with the All SVd population (8.8% and 3.7%, 
respectively).

Treatment-related adverse events 
Table 7: Treatment-related adverse events occurring in ≥5% of Patients in the All SVd 
Population, Safety Population – Updated analysis 
The overall incidence of TRAEs as of the updated analysis data cut was higher in the All SVd population 
and BOSTON SVd arm compared with the BOSTON Vd arm (94.4% and 95.9%, respectively vs 81.9%) 
and the imbalance was primarily due to the known AEs of selinexor. 
The most common TRAEs (reported in ≥20% patients in the All SVd population), which were reported 
more frequently in the All SVd population and BOSTON SVd arm than the BOSTON Vd arm, were 
thrombocytopenia (53.5% and 57.4%, respectively, vs 23.5%), nausea (47.2% and 47.7%, 
respectively, vs 5.9%) fatigue (34.2% and 35.4%, respectively vs 9.3%), decreased appetite (34.2% 
and 32.3%, respectively, vs. 3.9%), diarrhoea (23.3% and 19.5%, respectively vs. 15.2%), anaemia 
(22.3% and 22.6%, respectively, vs. 8.8%), and weight decreased (21.6% and 19.5%, respectively, 
vs. 3.9%). 
Treatment-related PN was more frequently reported in the BOSTON Vd arm (47.1%) than the All SVd 
population (26.9%) and BOSTON SVd arm (32.3%).

Incidence of any Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy events (secondary endpoint) 
As of the updated analysis data cut-off date (15 Feb 2021), Grade ≥2 PN events were reported in a 
total of 42 (21.5%) patients in the SVd arm and 73 (35.8%) patients in the Vd arm.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In the All SVd population, 31 (10.3%) patients died within 30 days of last dose of study treatment. 
Of the 31 patients, 24 (7.9%) had the primary cause of death attributed to AEs and 7 (2.3%) patients 
died due to PD. 
In the BOSTON study, as of the updated analysis data cut, a total of 148 (36.8%) patients died on 
the study (before withdrawal of consent): 68 (16.9%) patients in the SVd arm and 80 (19.9%) 
patients randomized in the Vd arm. Of the 80 deaths that occurred in the Vd arm, one of the deaths 
occurred in a patient prior to initiation of therapy and is therefore not included in the Safety 
Population. A total of 34 (8.5%) patients in the safety population died on treatment or within 30 days 
of last dose of study drug, with a similar frequency in the 2 treatment arms (8.2% and 8.8% in SVd 
and Vd arms, respectively). Among the 148 patients who died on study, the most common cause of 
death was PD in both the SVd arm (33/68 [48.5%]) and Vd arm (35/80 [43.8%]). Patients with TEAEs 
leading to death were comparable between the 2 arms with 14 (7.2%) patients in the SVd arm and 13 
(6.4%) patients in the Vd arm. 
Four of the 13 deaths due to TEAEs on the SVd arm occurred in India during the period between 2 Aug 
2018 and 31 Oct 2018; no deaths on the Vd arm occurred in India. Thus, one-third of the TEAEs 
leading to death on SVd occurred in India within a span of 3 months. To address the confluence of 
factors that led to the observed imbalance in the death rate relative to other countries, the Sponsor 
took the following steps to attempt to improve outcomes in patients in India:  
•  Retrained Investigators in India on the importance of supportive care and the specific 
supportive care recommendations included in the study protocol.  
Table 32. Summary of Efficacy for trial KCP-330-023 (BOSTON Study)  
EMA/620277/2022  
Page 102/151 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Implemented additional safety monitoring BIW, which established a parallel assessment 
schedule between the SVd and Vd arms.  
Increased communication between Sponsor and study Investigators in India. 
After the implementation of the additional measures, no new cases of sepsis or deaths were reported 
from India.

SVdX or SdX treatment are included. e Four of the 9 patients with TEAEs leading to death in the crossover arm died within 30 days 
of the last dose of Vd and within 7 days of SVdX study treatment. Denominator for the group is 74 (all crossover patients).  
f The number 47 includes 24 patients who died in the crossover arms, 30 days after the last dose of crossover treatment.  
g In addition to the 13 deaths due to TEAEs within 30 days of last dose of study drug, one patient (Patient ID: xxxxxxx) had a TEAE 
leading to death (PT: Pneumonia); the onset date was within 30 days of the last dose of the study drug; but, its outcome of death 
was reported as occurred 30 days after the last dose of study drug

Cytopenias 
Thrombocytopenia 
As of the updated analysis, the incidence of SMQ of thrombocytopenia was comparable in the All SVd 
population and BOSTON SVd arm (58.5% and 62.1%, respectively) and was higher than the BOSTON 
Vd arm (27.5%). The incidence of Grade 3/4 TEAEs and Grade 4 TEAEs of thrombocytopenia was higher 
in All SVd population and BOSTON SVd arm (Grade 3/4: 39.9% and 40.5%; Grade 4: 15.6% and 11.3%, 
respectively) compared with BOSTON Vd arm (Grade 3/4: 17.6%; Grade 4: 6.9%). Since the primary 
analysis, 4, 2, and 1 additional patient reported Grade 3/4 TEAEs; and 1, 1, and 0 additional patients 
reported Grade 4 TEAEs in All SVd population, BOSTON SVd arm, and BOSTON Vd arm, respectively. 
The Grade 4 TEAE reported in the BOSTON  SVd arm was not associated with any Grade ≥3 bleeding 
events. The incidence of SAEs and discontinuations due to thrombocytopenia was low across all arms 
(SAEs:  2.0%,  1.5%,  and  0.5%  and  discontinuations:  2.7%,  2.1%,  and  0.5%,  in  All  SVd  population, 
BOSTON  SVd  arm,  and  BOSTON  Vd  arm,  respectively)  with  no  change  in  the  incidence  in  any  of  the 
groups since primary analysis. The majority of the TEAEs were managed by dose modifications (36.9%, 
40.0%, and 9.8%, in All SVd population, BOSTON SVd arm, and BOSTON Vd arm, respectively). In the 
ALL SVd population, BOSTON SVd arm, and the BOSTON Vd arm, the incidence of Grade ≥3 bleeding 
events among the patients with Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia was same as the primary analysis (5.0%, 
5.1% and 5.6%, respectively).

Decreased appetite/weight decreased 
For  the  TEAE  of  decreased  appetite,  there  was  no change  in  the  incidence  of  TEAEs,  Grade  3  TEAEs, 
SAEs,  TEAEs  leading  to  dose  modifications,  and  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  compared  with  the 
primary analysis in all 3 groups. No Grade 4 TEAEs or deaths were reported in any of the 3 groups. 
For the TEAE of decreased weight, the incidence of all TEAEs, SAEs, TEAEs leading to dose modifications, 
or discontinuations of treatment was similar to the primary analysis in all 3 groups. One additional patient 
reported a Grade 3 TEAE of weight decreased in the All SVd population and BOSTON SVd arm since the

The  CMQ  neurological  toxicity  retrieved  following  PTs:  amnesia,  cognitive  disorder,  confusional  state, 
delirium, depressed level of consciousness, dizziness, encephalopathy, hypersomnia, somnolence, and 
syncope. Peripheral neuropathy was not included. 
The incidence of neurological toxicity (CMQ) was similar in the All SVd population and BOSTON SVd arm 
and higher than the BOSTON Vd arm (All TEAEs: 24.6%, 24.6%, 7.8%; and Grade 3: 5.0%, 4.1%, and 
1.0% respectively); 1 additional patient in the All SVd population and BOSTON SVd arm (and none in 
the BOSTON Vd arm) reported TEAEs of neurological toxicity (PT: delirium; Grade 3, lasting 36 days and 
assessed as unrelated to any of the study treatments) since the primary analysis. No Grade 4 events 
were reported in either arm. The incidence of SAEs and discontinuations of neurological toxicity was low 
and was comparable across all 3 groups (SAEs: 2.0%, 1.5% and 0.5%, respectively; discontinuation: 
3.0%, 2.1% and 1.0% in All SVd population, BOSTON SVd arm and BOSTON Vd arm, respectively); 1 
additional patient reported an SAE in All SVd population and BOSTON SVd arm since the primary analysis. 
There were no new patients with discontinuation of study treatment due to TEAE of neurological toxicity 
since the primary analysis. There were no deaths due to TEAEs of neurological toxicity

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
As of the updated analysis, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were reported in 67 
(22.3%) patients in the All SVd population and 41 (21.0%) patients in the BOSTON SVd arm compared 
with 34 (16.7%) patients in the BOSTON Vd arm (Table 29). No additional patients discontinued study 
treatment due to TEAEs in the BOSTON SVd arm since the primary analysis. Of the total 34 patients in 
the BOSTON Vd arm who discontinued treatment due to TEAEs, 2 discontinued (1 due to PN and 1 due 
to corona virus infection) after the primary analysis. 
PN remained the most common cause of treatment discontinuation across all 3 groups, with a higher 
incidence in the BOSTON Vd arm (7.8%) compared with the All SVd (4.0%) and BOSTON SVd arm 
(4.6%).

Overall, 253 (63.4%) patients in the Safety Population experienced dose reduction due to any cause. 
The frequency dose reduction was higher in the SVd arm compared with the Vd arm (73.3% versus 
53.9%, respectively). 
Table 39: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction in ≥4 Patients in 
Either Arm (Safety Population) – Updated analysis 
In the updated analysis, TEAEs leading to dose reduction were reported in 141 (72.3%) patients in the 
SVd arm and 106 (52.0%) patients in the Vd arm. No additional patients required dose reduction due 
to TEAEs in the SVd arm since the primary analysis. Of the 106 patients with dose reductions due to 
TEAEs in the Vd arm, 2 patients had at least 1 TEAE leading to dose reduction after the primary 
analysis. 
The proportion of patients with dose reductions due to TEAEs was higher in the SVd arm compared 
with the Vd arm (72.3% versus 52.0%). The most common AEs leading to dose reduction were PN 
(SVd, 20.0%; Vd, 28.4%), thrombocytopenia (SVd, 33.3%; Vd, 4.4%), and fatigue (SVd, 10.8%; Vd, 
2.5%). 
Adverse events leading to dose interruption 
Overall, 328 (82.2%) patients in the Safety Population experienced dose delay or interruption due to 
any cause. The frequency of dose delay or interruption was higher in the SVd arm compared with the 
Vd arm (88.7% versus 76.0%, respectively).  
The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to dose interruption in patients receiving SVd were 
thrombocytopenia (34.9%), asthenia (13.8%), fatigue (13.8%) and pneumonia (10.8%) In patients

2.5.1.  Post marketing experience 
As of 15 Feb 2021, approximately 2659 patients were treated with XPOVIO (selinexor). Adverse event 
reports (n=1397) from the commercial use of selinexor have been received through 15 Feb 2021 and 
are in line with the expected side effect profile based on the package insert for RRMM. Majority of the 
events were non-serious (84.2%) and 15.8% events were serious. There have been 222 fatal reports 
among the approximately 2659 patients who received selinexor since its commercial availability. 
According to the MAH, the postmarketing safety data with selinexor is consistent with what was 
observed during the clinical studies and no new safety signals were identified.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Through the current variation application, the MAH is seeking an extension of the indication for selinexor 
in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with RRMM who 
had received 1 to 3 prior regimens.  
Safety data of this application is mainly based on results from the BOSTON study (KCP-330-023), a 
Phase 3 randomised, open-label, multicenter study in which selinexor in combination with bortezomib 
and dexamethasone (SVd; n=195) was compared with bortezomib plus dexamethasone (Vd; n=204). 
In addition, safety data of 42 patients included in Arm 2 of the study STOMP (KCP-330-017) have been 
provided which is considered supportive, since not all of these patients received the recommended dosing 
regimen for SVd. Pooled safety data of the BOSTON and STOMP studies as well as data of the 64 patients 
who crossed over from the Vd arm to the SVd arm in the BOSTON study have been submitted (n=301).  
Safety data discussed below are based on the last data cut-off (15 Feb 2021) from the BOSTON study. 
In the BOSTON study selinexor was administered at a dose of 100 mg PO plus bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 
SC plus dexamethasone 40 mg (20 mg dose 2 days per week) in 35-days cycles. It should be noted that 
the recommended dose of selinexor in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone differs from the 
one  currently  authorised  (i.e.  80  mg  on  days  1  and  3  in  combination  with  dexamethasone).  As  per 
protocol, a selinexor dose escalation (i.e. increase selinexor to a fixed 60 mg dose BIW during Weeks 1 
through  5  of  each  cycle  and  dexamethasone  20  mg  BIW  on  the  same  days  as  selinexor)  may  be 
considered for patients who do not achieve at least a PR within the first 2 cycles, were tolerating SVd 
and do not have any AEs related to study treatment Grade >2 at the time of dose escalation.  
At the time of the data cut-off 37 (9.3%) patients were still on treatment (21 in the SVd arm and 16 in 
the Vd arm). Disease progression was the main cause for treatment discontinuation in both treatment 
arms (76 [39%] patient SVd and 118 [57.8%] patients Vd). A higher number of patients in the SVd arm 
withdrawn consent compared with Vd (37 [19.0%] vs. 21 [10.3%], respectively). The main reasons for 
patient withdrawal consent were related to AEs, logistical reasons and poor health/entered hospice care. 
Further, even though numbers are low, double of the patients discontinued treatment in the SVd arm 
due to physician decision (10 [5.1%] vs. 5 [2.5%]), being the main reason “patient not benefitting from 
treatment/PD not approved by IRC” (3 patients in each treatment arm). Other causes in the SVd arm 
included adverse events, poor health and logistical reasons. Somehow, these data reflect the increased 
toxicity of the combination with the addition of selinexor. 
Median treatment duration was similar between treatment arms (30 weeks in the SVd arm and 32 weeks 
in the Vd arm), with a treatment exposure of at least 48 weeks (i.e. around 11 months) in 35.9% and 
32.4% of patients, respectively. Dose modifications were more frequent in the SVd group compared with 
the Vd group (91.8% vs. 82.4%). As previously observed in the STORM study (i.e. in RRMM patients), 
dose delay/interruption (86.7%) and dose reduction (65.6%) to selinexor were frequent. It is important 
to note that doses of bortezomib and dexamethasone were lower in the experimental arm than in the 
control arm. However, dose delay/interruption to bortezomib (82.1% vs. 74.0%) and dexamethasone 
(80.0%  vs.  72.5%)  were  higher  in  the  SVd  arm.  According  to  the  MAH,  the  higher  rate  of  dose 
delay/interruptions  to  bortezomib  and  dexamethasone  may  be  due  to  concomitant  discontinuation  of 
selinexor, since in most cases the three drugs were interrupted or delayed for most TEAEs. There were 
51 (26.2%) patients with dose escalation in the SVd arm and 17 (8.3%) in the Vd arm. The MAH clarified 
that the majority of these dose increases were dose readjustments after a preceding dose reduction in 
selinexor and only 16 patients in the SVd arm had a dose escalation to selinexor 60 mg BIW. Besides, 
dose escalation in the Vd arm referred to dose increases of either bortezomib or dexamethasone after a 
previous dose reduction.

Patients included in the study had a median age of 67 (range: 38, 90) years. There were 79 patient who 
were ≥75 years, with a higher rate in the Vd arm (34 [17.4%] vs. 45 [22.1%]). Most of patients had an 
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. There were 20 (10.3%) patients in the SVd arm and 15 (7.4%) in 
the Vd arm with ECOG 2. All patients had received prior antineoplastic therapy, with a median of 1 and 
2 prior lines of anti-MM therapy in the SVd and Vd arms (range: 1, 3), respectively. According to the 
protocol patients must have received at least 1 prior anti-MM regimen and no more than 3 prior anti-MM 
regimens. A BSA <1.4 m2 at baseline was an exclusion criterion and according to the protocol, in no case 
may the selinexor dose exceed 70 mg/m2 per dose for any patient. In the SVd arm baseline median BSA 
was 1.85 (range: 1.4, 2.4). The MAH was requested to clarify what was the recommendation for those 
patients (if any) that due to body weight fluctuations reached a BSA <1.4 m2 during the study and justify 
whether any dose restriction according to BSA should be included in the SmPC. According to the MAH 
only 2 patients reached a BSA <1.4 m2 during the study. In both cases, the dose of selinexor had been 
previously reduced due to toxicity and was lower than the stipulated limit. Bearing in mind that a higher 
exposure  may  be  translated  into  higher  toxicity  and  considering  the  already  known  safety  profile  of 
selinexor a restriction not to exceed the 70 mg/m2 per dose has been included in the SmPC.  
Most  patients  (99.5%)  received  at  least  1  concomitant  medication.  In  the  SVd  arm,  most  commonly 
treatments received were antiemetics, mainly serotonin (5-HT3) antagonists (88.2%).  
Patients  with  symptomatic  ischemia,  uncontrolled  clinically  significant  conduction  abnormalities, 
congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association Class ≥3 or known left ventricular ejection fraction 
<40%, or myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to C1D1 were excluded from the study. 
Almost  all  patients  reported  at  least  one  adverse  event  (>97%)  in  both  treatment  arms.  The  most 
commonly  reported  adverse  events  (AEs)  (≥20%)  in  the  SVd  arm  were  thrombocytopenia  (62.1% 
SVd  vs.  27.5%  Vd),  nausea  (50.3%  vs.  10.3%),  fatigue  (42.1%  vs.  18.1%),  anaemia  (37.4%  vs. 
23.5%),  decreased  appetite  (35.4%  vs.  5.4%),  diarrhoea  (33.3%  vs.  25.5%),  peripheral  neuropathy 
(33.3% vs. 48.5%), weight decreased (26.2% vs. 12.3%), vomiting (20.5% vs. 4.9%), cataract (23.6% 
vs. 7.4%) and asthenia (25.1% vs. 13.2%).  
There were other less frequent AEs with a higher incidence in the SVd arm compared with the Vd arm, 
such  as  visual  impairment  (7.2%  vs.  2.0%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (20.5%  vs.  14.7%), 
nasopharyngitis  (11.8%  vs.  4.9%),  septic  shock  (2.1%  vs.  0),  hyponatraemia  (7.7%  vs.  1.5%), 
hypophosphatemia  (8.7%  vs.  3.4%),  dizziness  (12.3%  vs.  4.4%),  dysgeusia  (6.7%  vs.  0.5%), 
confusional  state  (8.2%  vs.  1.0%),  depression  (3.6%  vs.  0)  and  oropharyngeal  pain  (7.2%  vs.  2%). 
Cardiac AEs were also more frequent in the SVd arm (17.4% vs. 7.8%), although it does not appear to 
be driven by any particular PT. 
A higher proportion of patients reported TEAEs of haemorrhage in the SVd arm compared with the Vd 
arm (34 [17.4%] vs. 15 (7.4%)]), although most of these events were of grade 1 or 2. The most common 
TEAEs of haemorrhage in the SVd arm were epistaxis (5.6%) and contusion (3.1%). The incidence of 
TEAEs of Grade 3-4 and Grade 5 were comparable between treatment arms. However, SAEs were more 
frequent in the SVd arm (7 [3.6%] vs. 1 [0.5%]) and there were 8 (4.1%) patients that discontinued 
treatment  due  to  a  TEAE  (while  none  in  the  control  arm).  SAEs  included  two  fatal  TEAEs  (1  cerebral 
haemorrhage and 1 haemorrhagic shock). The event of cerebral haemorrhage occurred after only one 
dose of selinexor and in the context of PD; thus it appears unlikely to be related to selinexor treatment. 
However, contribution of selinexor to the haemorrhagic shock fatal TEAE cannot be ruled out, since it 
occurred  in  a  patient  with  thrombocytopenia,  which  is  a  known  ADR  of  selinexor.  Other  SAEs  were 
epistaxis (3), haematuria (1) and lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The events of epistaxis occurred 
in patients with thrombocytopenia, which is a known ADR of selinexor, therefore, they can be considered 
related to selinexor (even if in some of them other confounding factors were also present). Moreover, in 
one  of  these  patients  an  event  of  melena  was  also  reported.  Regarding  the  events  of  lower 
Table 32. Summary of Efficacy for trial KCP-330-023 (BOSTON Study)

gastrointestinal haemorrhage and haematuria, a causal relationship with selinexor cannot be established. 
Information  on  the  risk  of  thrombocytopenia  as  well  as  significant  bleeding  in  patients  treated  with 
selinexor is already included in the SmPC. 
There  were  10  (5.1%)  patients  in  the  SVd  arm  with  an  event  of  overdose  (7  were  due  to  selinexor 
overdose). Five of these patients had a TEAE. In most of the cases of selinexor overdose the patient had 
took an extra dose of selinexor. There was also one patient that erroneously took 320 mg of selinexor 
who suffer a SAE of pulmonary embolism that resolved. No other SAEs were reported. Medication errors 
is included as an important potential risk in the RMP.  
AEs of Grade 3/4 were more frequently reported in the SVd arm compared with the Vd arm (78.5% vs. 
56.4%).  The  most  frequently  reported  (≥10%)  in  the  SVd  arm  were  thrombocytopenia  (40.5%  vs. 
17.6%), anaemia (16.4% vs. 9.8%), fatigue (13.3% vs. 1%) and cataract (11.3% vs. 2%).  
Of  note,  the  indicende  of  Grade  ≥2  peripheral  neuropathy  events  was  a  secondary  endpoint  in  the 
BOSTON study. A lower rate of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy events was reported in the SVd arm 
compared with the Vd arm (42 [21.5%] vs. 73 [35.8%] Vd), which is not unexpected taking into account 
the lower dose of bortezomib in the experimental arm.  
Up to the data cut-off, 147 patients had died in the BOSTON study (68 [34.9%] SVd and 79 [38.7%] 
Vd). According to the MAH most of these deaths were due to disease progression (33/68 [48.5%]) SVd 
and 35/80 [43.8%] Vd). There were 34 patients who died while on treatment or withing 30 days of the 
last dose of study treatment (16 [8.2%] and 18 [8.8%] patients in the SVd and Vd groups, respectively), 
the majority of these deaths were related to an AE (13 [6.7%] and 14 [6.9%]). In the SVd arm the most 
common  AEs  leading to  death  were  pneumonia  (3  [1.5%]  SVd  vs.  4  [2.0%] Vd)  and  septic  shock  (3 
[1.5%]  vs  0).  According  to  the  MAH,  the  3  fatal  AEs  of  septic  shock  occurred  in  India  (see  further 
comments below). Moreover, there were 10 deaths due to AEs reported in patients who crossed over 
from the Vd arm to SVdX (9 events) and SdX (1 event). Of the 9 AEs leading to death in the SVdX arm, 
4 patients died within 30 days of the last dose of Vd and within 7 days of SVdX treatment. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were more frequent in the SVd arm compared with the Vd arm (54.4% 
vs. 38.7%). In the SVd arm more than a half of these SAEs were considered treatment related (29.7% 
vs. 11.8%). The most commonly reported SAEs (regardless of causality) were pneumonia (14.9% SVd 
vs. 13.2% Vd), cataract (4.6% vs. 0) and sepsis (4.1% vs. 1.0%).  
There were 41 (21%) patients in the SVd arm and 34 (16.7%) in the Vd arm that required treatment 
discontinuation  due  to  AEs.  The  main  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was  peripheral  neuropathy  (9 
[4.6%] SVd vs. 16 [7.8%] Vd) which is related to bortezomib treatment. Other AEs that led to treatment 
discontinuation in the SVd arm were fatigue (7 [3.6%]), nausea (6 [3.1%]), thrombocytopenia, vomiting 
and decreased appetite (2.1% each), all of them considered ADRs of selinexor.  
Dose modifications due to AEs were also frequent. In the SVd arm 72.3% of patients required any dose 
reduction compared with 52% of patients in the Vd arm. The main AEs that led to dose reductions in the 
SVd arm were thrombocytopenia (33.3% SVd vs. 4.4% Vd), peripheral neuropathy (20% vs. 28.4%) 
and  fatigue  (10.8%  vs.  2.5%).  Further,  85.6%  in  the  SVd  arm  and  68.1%  in  the  Vd  required  dose 
interruption  during  the  study.  The  main  AEs  that  led  to  dose  interruption  in  the  Sd  arm  were 
thrombocytopenia  (35.4%),  asthenia  (14.4%),  fatigue  (14.4%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(12.3%), and pneumonia (11.3%). 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
According to the protocol of the BOSTON study, AESIs for selinexor include cataracts and acute cerebellar 
syndrome (ACS). Further, the MAH has provided brief summaries of other significant adverse events, 
called AEs of clinical interest, which include cytopenias (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), gastrointestinal 
Table 32. Summary of Efficacy for trial KCP-330-023 (BOSTON Study)

events  (nausea,  vomiting),  decreased  appetite/weight  decreased,  infections  (pneumonia,  sepsis, 
opportunistic infections), eye disorders (blurred vision, cataract), hyponatremia, neurological and cardiac 
toxicity and hepatobiliary disorders. According to the MAH, these AEs were selected based on identified 
and potential risks of selinexor.  
Thrombocytopenia is a known ADR of selinexor. In the BOSTON study 62.1% of patients reported an 
event  of  thrombocytopenia,  with  40.5%  of  events  of  Grade  3/4  and  3  SAEs.  No  fatal  adverse  events 
were  reported.  According  to  the  MAH  events  were  managed  with  dose  modifications  (40%  SVd  vs. 
17.6%), thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists (29.3% SVd vs. 4.5% Vd) and platelet growth factors 
and platelet transfusions. Among patients with Grade ≥3 AEs of thrombocytopenia bleeding events were 
reported in 4 (5.1%) patients in the SVd arm and  2 (5.6%) patients in the Vd arm, thus despite the 
higher rate of thrombocytopenia in the SVd arm, it does not seem to be associated with an increased 
risk of bleeding events.  
Neutropenia was reported in 31 (15.9%) patients in the SVd arm and 14 (6.9%) patients in the Vd arm. 
The  majority  of  events  were  of  Grade  1  or  2.  AEs  of  Grade  3/4  were  reported  in  9.7%  and  3.9%  of 
patients respectively. Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1 patient in each treatment arm. According to 
the MAH, neutropenia events were managed with dose modifications ang G-CSF treatment.  
Gastrointestinal adverse events, including vomiting and nausea, are among the most frequently reported 
AEs in patients treated with selinexor. Other characteristic AEs of selinexor are decreased appetite and 
weight decreased. As previously discussed at the time of the MAA, these AEs (including fatigue) have 
been reported with other XPO-1 inhibitors and are considered a class effect. While the exact mechanism 
associated to these AEs is unknown, it is considered they might be mediated by CNS toxicity. According 
to the MAH in most cases several of these AEs were concurrent. Although it is acknowledged that most 
of these events were mild, they led to treatment discontinuation in several patients despite treatment 
measures. As per protocol, all patients should receive 5-HT3 antagonists (or alternative treatment if the 
patient does not tolerate 5-HT3 antagonists), starting on C1D1 before the first dose of study treatment. 
It  is  important  to  implement  early  measures  (i.e.  dose  modifications  and  supportive  treatments)  in 
patients  treated  with  selinexor,  particularly  taking  into  account  the  inherent  risk  of  these  patients  to 
suffer from this type of AEs.  
In the BOSTON study 8 (4.1%) patients reported AEs of sepsis in the SVd arm compared with 2 (1.0%). 
According to the MAH, disbalances between treatment arms are mainly driven by 4 cases reported in 
India, of which 3 were fatal, in 23 patients treated with SVd. The MAH argues that the higher rate of 
sepsis  in  India  may  be  due  to  an  inadequate  management  of  these  patients,  in  addition  to  prior 
treatments received and the presence of other conditions such as asthma. Further, the MAH states that 
2 of these 4 patients had significant weight loss, an important identified risk of selinexor. According to 
the MAH, additional measures were implemented and since then no new cases were identified and even 
SAEs  were  reduced.  Safety  data  from  the  23  patients  treated  with  SVd  in  India  have  been  provided. 
SAEs were more frequent in patients from India compared with other countries (65.2% vs. 50%), mainly 
vomiting (3 [13%] vs. 4 [2.3%]) and septic shock (3 [13%] vs. 1 [0.6%]). Treatment discontinuation 
was also more frequent in patients from India (17.4% vs. 4.7).  
The incidence of opportunistic infections was almost double in the SVd arm compared with Vd arm (8.2% 
vs. 4.4%), although SAEs were similar (3 [1.5%] vs. 2 [1%]) and no fatal AEs were reported. The most 
frequent  opportunistic  infections  were  candida  infections,  herpes  zoster,  herpes  virus  and  to  a  lesser 
extent respiratory syncytial virus infection. SAEs of opportunistic infections reported in the SVd arm were 
respiratory syncytial virus (2 events) and meningitis tuberculous (1 event). 
Blurred vision and cataract, respectively, are considered very common and common ADRs of selinexor. 
In the BOSTON study 27 (13.8%) patients reported AE of blurred vision, most of them mild/moderate 
Table 32. Summary of Efficacy for trial KCP-330-023 (BOSTON Study)

and no SAEs were observed. Regarding cataract, a higher rate of AEs of cataract was reported in the 
SVd arm compared with the Vd arm (23.6% vs. 7.4%). Of these, 11 (11.3%) were of Grade 3/4 in the 
SVd arm while only 4 (2.0%) in the Vd arm. Further, there were 9 (4.6%) patients with SAEs in the SVd 
and none in the Vd arm. According to the MAH, the higher risk of cataract in the SVd arm vs Vd arm 
may  be  related  to  selinexor  increasing  the  risk  of  glucocorticoid-associated  cataract.  Ophthalmology 
examination  (OE)  during  screening  was  performed  in  approximately  97%  of  patients.  Of  these,  120 
(61.5%) in the SVd and 130 (63.7%) in the Vd had cataract at baseline. A warning regarding cataract 
has been included in section 4.4. of the SmPC.  
Neurological toxicity was reported in 48 (24.6%) patients in the SVd arm while 16 (7.8%) in the Vd arm. 
Of  these,  8  (4.1%)  and  3  (1.5%)  patients,  reported  AEs  of  Grade  3  and  SAEs  in  the  SVd  group, 
respectively. The most frequently reported AEs were dizziness and confusional state, which are already 
included as ADRs in the SmPC. Considering the All SVd population (i.e. including patients who crossed 
over  from  the  Vd  to  the  SVd  arm  and  patients  from  STOMP  study),  a  total  of  6  patients  reported 
neurological  SAEs, 
including  2  delirium,  2  syncope,  1  encephalopathy  and  1  cognitive 
disorder/confusional  state  and  most  of  them  were  considered  related  to  selinexor  treatment  by  the 
investigator.  
A higher incidence of cardiac events was reported in the SVd arm compared with the Vd arm (10.8% vs 
3.4%). There were 3 (1.5%) vs. 1 (0.5%) AEs of Grade 3 and 5 (2.6%) vs 2 (1.0%) SAEs, in the SVd 
and Vd groups, respectively. No fatal AEs were reported. Tachycardia and atrial fibrillation were the most 
commonly reported. In fact, most of SAEs were atrial fibrillation. Tachycardia is currently included as 
ADR of selinexor. Regarding atrial fibrillation the incidence was slightly higher in the SVd arm (7 [3.6%] 
vs. 3 [1.5%]) and at least in 4 patients the event was considered serious. However, in many of these 
cases,  other  risk  factors  were  present  and  therefore  a  clear  relationship  with  selinexor  cannot  be 
established at this stage. The MAH is encouraged to closely monitor it through routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
No events of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) were reported in the SVd arm of the BOSTON study. TLS is 
included as an ADR in the SmPC (sections 4.4. and 4.8). According to the MAH, there were no cases of 
ACS in the BOSTON study (neither in the STOMP study).  
Laboratory findings 
Overall, laboratory findings are reflecting the safety profile of selinexor. Shifts to a worst post-baseline 
value (i.e. from Grade<3 to Grade 3 or 4) observed in clinical parameters in a higher rate in the SVd 
arm  compared  with  the  Vd  arm  were  leukopenia  (10.3%  vs.  2.5%),  lymphocytopenia  (38.3%  vs. 
25.1%), thrombocytopenia (42.6% vs. 19.4%), hypophosphatemia (23.4% vs. 9.9%) and hyponatremia 
(13.8% vs 3.0%).  
ECG  assessments  were  performed  at  baseline  on  all  patients  and  at  end  of  treatment  or  as  clinically 
indicated. Of the 72 and 52 patients in the SVd and Vd arm, respectively, with any post-baseline ECG, 
in the SVd group there were 2 (2.8%) patients with a QTcF≥500 and 7 (9.7%) with an increase from 
baseline >60 while no QTcF values ≥500 were reported in the Vd arm and only 1 (1.9%) patient had an 
increase >60. According to the MAH, most of these patients had history of cardiac events and no cases 
of Torsade de Pointes nor any other ventricular arrhythmia were reported.  
Subgroups of special interest 
Safety data have been presented according to age, sex, race and renal function.   
With  regards  to  age,  a  higher  rate  of  SAEs  (56.0%  vs.  46.5%  vs.)  and  discontinuations  (27.5%  vs. 
12.8%) due to AEs is observed in the subgroup of elderly patients (≥65 years) compared with younger 
patients  (<65).  In  the  subgroup  of  patients  ≥75  years  (n=34)  the  incidence  of  Grade  3/4  AEs  was 
Table 32. Summary of Efficacy for trial KCP-330-023 (BOSTON Study)  
EMA/620277/2022  
Page 141/151 
 
 
 
increased. However, a similar pattern is also observed in the control arm. By PT, fatigue, dizziness and 
confusional state were more frequent in elderly patients. It is however surprising that cataract, whose 
incidence increase with age, was more frequent in patients <65 (15.6% vs. 29.1%). According to the 
MAH  a  definitive  mechanism  for  the  imbalance  in  the  cataract  rates  could  not  be  identified  and  it  is 
considered that several factors may have contributed (i.e. longer duration of exposure to study treatment 
in younger patients, a higher median number of prior lines received, a higher total dexamethasone dose 
received and a higher median duration of the most recent prior therapy). 
The safety profile of SVd appears to be worse in female patients, according to the higher rates of Grade 
4 AEs (21.3% female vs. 14.8% male), SAEs (61.3% vs. 45.2%), dose reductions (78.8% vs. 67.8%), 
dose interruptions (91.3% vs. 81.7%) and study treatment discontinuations (26.3% vs. 17.4%). AEs 
more  frequently  reported  in  women  than  men  were  nausea,  fatigue,  diarrhoea,  weigh  decreased, 
vomiting,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  neutropenia,  oedema  peripheral  and  hypokalaemia.  
According to the MAH, the higher incidence of some TEAEs in female patients compared with male patient 
may  be  due  to  the  (expected)  lower  body  weight  and  therefore  higher  selinexor  exposure  in  female 
patients. Overall, TEAEs reported in a higher frequency in female patients are already known ADRs of 
selinexor. 
A total of 25 patients in the SVd arm had mild hepatic impairment while none of them had moderate 
hepatic impairment. Acknowledging the limited sample size, a higher rate of TEAEs of Grade 3/4, SAEs, 
dose interruptions (all patients except one required a dose interruption) and deaths were reported in 
patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  treated  with  SVd  compared  with  patients  with  normal  hepatic 
function. However, the number of patients with mild hepatic impairment was low and differences do not 
appear to be driven by any particular TEAE.

2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The addition of selinexor to Vd involves an increase in toxicity, with higher rates of Grade 3/4 AEs, 
SAEs, dose modifications and treatment discontinuations.  
The most commonly reported AEs (SVd vs Vd) were thrombocytopenia (62.1% vs. 27.5%), nausea 
(50.3% vs. 10.3%), fatigue (42.1% vs. 18.1%), anaemia (37.4% vs. 23.5%), decreased appetite 
(35.4% vs. 5.4%), diarrhoea (33.3% vs. 25.5%), peripheral neuropathy (33.3% vs. 48.5%), weight 
decreased (26.2% vs. 12.3%), vomiting (20.5% vs. 4.9%), cataract (23.6% vs. 7.4%) and asthenia 
(25.1% vs. 13.2%). Most of these AEs are considered ADRs of selinexor, except for peripheral 
neuropathy, which is a known ADR of bortezomib. Of note, the incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 
lower in the SVd arm due to the lower dose of bortezomib. Overall, the safety profile of the 
combination was consistent with the already known safety profile of its components.

4.1.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and 
do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
5.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
5.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Nexpovio (selinexor) received a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) valid throughout the EU on 
26 March 2021, for its use in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
in adult patients who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at 
least two proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, 
and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.  
To fulfil the Specific Obligation (SOB) of the initial CMA the MAH was requested to submit the results of 
the phase 3, KCP-330-023/BOSTON study comparing the efficacy and safety of selinexor plus bortezomib 
plus low-dose dexamethasone versus bortezomib plus low dose dexamethasone in adult patients with 
relapsed/refractory  multiple  myeloma  who have  received  1  to  3  prior  anti-MM  regimens.  The  present 
application incorporates both the primary analysis of the BOSTON study as well as updated data using a 
later data cut-off (15 Feb 2021). 
With the current application, the MAH is submitting a Grouped Type II /Type IB variation of selinexor 
(Nexpovio): 
• 
• 
The Type II variation is aimed at extending the indication for Nexpovio to be used “in combination 
with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who 
have received at least one prior therapy” and to fulfil the SOB in the context of the initial CMA, as 
mentioned above. 
The Type IB variation relates to the introduction of a new pack size (8 tablets per pack) for added 
convenience to patients for dose modification in the new intended treatment setting. 
5.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cells disorder, that represents approximately a 0.8% of all 
cancers  worldwide  (Ferlay  2015).  The  proliferation  of  the  malignant  clonal  plasma  cells  leads  to 
subsequent replacement of normal bone marrow haematopoietic precursors and overproduction of M-
proteins with progressive morbidity and eventual mortality. 
Characteristic  MM  hallmarks  include  osteolytic  lesions,  anaemia  (due  to  bone  marrow  dysfunction), 
increased  susceptibility 
to 
infections 
(due 
to 
immunosuppression),  hypercalcemia, 
renal 
insufficiency/failure, and neurological complications (Palumbo 2011). 
5.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Nowadays, different classes of drugs are available for multiple myeloma patients (alkylators, steroids, 
proteasome inhibitors [PIs], immunomodulatory agents [IMiDs], histone deacetylase inhibitors [HDACIs] 
and monoclonal antibodies). Among these treatment options, lenalidomide (an IMiD) and bortezomib (a 
PI) have a prominent role. Both are used as frontline treatment of MM and in combination with other 
drugs at relapse.  
Table 32. Summary of Efficacy for trial KCP-330-023 (BOSTON Study)  
EMA/620277/2022

The  International  Myeloma  Working  Group  (IMWG)  recommends  treating  relapsed  MM  patients 
considering patient-specific factors, tumour characteristics and prior therapy (both type of therapy and 
the  response  to  the  therapy;  Ludwig  2014).  With  disease  progression,  a  change  in  drug  classes  is 
recommended.  
5.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This  application  is  based  on  the  efficacy  results  from  the  pivotal  ongoing  Phase  3  KCP-330-023 
(BOSTON) study and supported by the Phase 1b/2 KCP-330-017 (STOMP) study. 
Results  presented  below  are  based  on  the  primary  analysis  (DCO:  18  Feb  2020),  unless  otherwise 
specified. 
5.2.  Favourable effects 
• 
Treatment with selinexor plus bortezomib plus low-dose dexamethasone (SVd) resulted in a 
statistically significant improvement in PFS in the SVd arm (13.93 months) compared with 
bortezomib plus low-dose dexamethasone (Vd) (9.46 months); HR=0.70 (95% CI: 0.5279, 
0.9335) p=0.0075; at a median overall follow-up of 13.17 and 16.53 months for the SVd and Vd 
arms, respectively. These results were generally consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses and 
pre-specified subgroups.  
•  A higher ORR was observed for the SVd group (76.4%) compared with the Vd group (62.3%). The 
estimate of odds ratio was 1.96 with 95% CI (1.26, 3.05); p =0.0012. 
• 
The rate of ≥VGPR (sCR + CR + VGPR) was higher for the SVd group (44.6%) compared with the 
Vd group (32.4%); p=0.0082   
•  Median OS was not reached for SVd at a median follow-up of 17.3 months. The probability of 
survival was higher for the SVd arm throughout the study. The median OS for patients in the Vd 
arm was 24.97 months (95% CI: 23.49, NE). 
• 
• 
The median DOR in patients with confirmed PR or better was of 20.3 (95% CI: 12.55, NE) months 
in the SVd arm and 12.9 (95% CI: 9.26, 15.77) months in the Vd arm.  
The median TTNT in the SVd arm was 16.1 months (95% CI: 13.9, NE) compared to 10.8 months 
(95% CI: 9.8, 13.4) in the Vd arm. 
The results from the updated analysis of the BOSTON study (DCO 15 Feb 2021) were overall consistent 
with the results of the primary analysis.  
Further, updated OS data with a median follow-up of 33.61 months in the SVd arm and 33.84 monhts 
in the Vd arm (DCO 22 March 2022) showed a HR of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.27). 
5.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although  the  control  arm  in  the  BOSTON  study  is  an  accepted  standard  of  care,  the  room  for 
improvement of response of a patient previously exposed to bortezomib, alone or in combination in a 
previous first line, appears limited with the proposed combination and in fact Vd is usually considered as 
an option in later lines of treatment. In this context, the control arm in the BOSTON study (Vd) could be 
considered, at present, as a suboptimal treatment option in the intended treatment setting. This said, it 
is acknowledged that the treatment landscape for MM patients is evolving quickly and demonstration of 
superiority vs. the proposed control arm should in principle suffice for regulatory approval.

5.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the BOSTON study almost all patients, reported at least one adverse event (>97%) in both treatment 
arms.  The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  events  (AEs)  (≥20%)  in  the  SVd  arm  were 
thrombocytopenia (62.1% SVd vs. 27.5% Vd), nausea (50.3% vs. 10.3%), fatigue (42.1% vs. 18.1%), 
anaemia  (37.4%  vs.  23.5%),  decreased  appetite  (35.4%  vs.  5.4%),  diarrhoea  (33.3%  vs.  25.5%), 
peripheral neuropathy (33.3% vs. 48.5%), weight decreased (26.2% vs. 12.3%), vomiting (20.5% vs. 
4.9%), cataract (23.6% vs. 7.4%) and asthenia (25.1% vs. 13.2%). 
AEs of Grade 3/4 were reported in 78.5% of patients in the SVd arm and 56.4% in the Vd arm. The most 
frequently  reported  AEs  of  Grade  3/4  (≥10%)  in  the  SVd  arm  were  thrombocytopenia  (40.5%  vs. 
17.6%), anaemia (16.4% vs. 9.8%), fatigue (13.3% vs. 1%) and cataract (11.3% vs. 2%). 
Up to the data cut-off, 147 patients had died in the BOSTON study (68 [34.9%] SVd and 79 [38.7%] 
Vd), most of them due to disease progression. There were 34 patients who died while on treatment or 
withing 30 days of the last dose of study treatment (16 [8.2%] SVd and 18 [8.8%] Vd groups) and the 
majority of these deaths were related to an AE (13 [6.7%] SVd and 14 [6.9%] Vd). In the SVd arm the 
most common AEs leading to death were pneumonia (3 [1.5%] SVd vs. 4 [2.0%] Vd) and septic shock 
(3 [1.5%] vs 0).  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were more frequent in the SVd arm compared with the Vd arm (54.4% 
vs. 38.7%). In the SVd arm more than a half of these SAEs were considered treatment related (29.7% 
vs. 11.8%). The most commonly reported SAEs (regardless of causality) were pneumonia (14.9% SVd 
vs. 13.2% Vd), cataract (4.6% vs. 0) and sepsis (4.1% vs. 1.0%). 
There were 41 (21%) patients in the SVd arm and 34 (16.7%) in the Vd arm that required treatment 
discontinuation due to AEs. The main AEs leading to discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (9 [4.6%] 
SVd  vs.  16  [7.8%]  Vd)  which  is  related  to  bortezomib  treatment.  Other  AEs  that  led  to  treatment 
discontinuation in the SVd arm were fatigue (7 [3.6%]), nausea (6 [3.1%]), thrombocytopenia, vomiting 
and decreased appetite (2.1% each). 
In the SVd arm 72.3% of patients required any dose reduction compared with 52% of patients in the Vd 
arm. The main AEs that led to dose reductions in the SVd arm were thrombocytopenia (33.3% SVd vs. 
4.4% Vd), peripheral neuropathy (20% vs. 28.4%) and fatigue (10.8% vs. 2.5%). Further, 85.6% in 
the SVd arm and 68.1% in the Vd required dose interruption during the study. The main AEs that led to 
dose interruption in the Sd arm were thrombocytopenia (35.4%), asthenia (14.4%), fatigue (14.4%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (12.3%), and pneumonia (11.3%). 
Other AEs reported in patients treated with SVd and which are known ADRs of selinexor or considered 
significant  AEs  of  selinexor  were  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  nausea,  vomiting,  decreased 
appetite/weight  decreased,  infections  (pneumonia,  sepsis,  opportunistic  infections),  eye  disorders 
(blurred vision, cataract), hyponatremia, neurological and cardiac toxicity and hepatobiliary disorders.

5.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
5.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment with the (once weekly) combination of selinexor with bortezomib and dexamethasone tested 
in the BOSTON study (SVd) leads to a significant improvement in median PFS compared to the standard 
(BIW) Vd regimen in the targeted patient population, i.e. adult patients with multiple myeloma who have 
received  at  least  one  prior  therapy.  This  benefit  in  terms  of  PFS  is  supported  by  several  secondary 
endpoints. Moreover, no evidence of detrimental effects on survival has been observed also considering 
that cross over to either SVd or Sd was allowed in the trial.  
From the safety point of view, the addition of selinexor to Vd treatment involves a remarkable increase 
in  toxicity,  with  a  higher  rate  of  Grade  3/4  AEs,  SAEs  and  treatment  discontinuations.  The  most 
commonly  reported  AEs  were  thrombocytopenia,  nausea,  fatigue,  anaemia,  decreased  appetite, 
diarrhoea,  peripheral  neuropathy,  weight  decreased,  vomiting,  cataract  and  asthenia.  Of  note,  since 
doses  of  bortezomib  in  the  SVd  arm  were  lower  than  in  the  Vd  arm,  a  lower  incidence  of  peripheral 
neuropathy was reported in patients treated with SVd.  
5.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Selinexor in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone has demonstrated an improvement in PFS 
compared to the standard (BIW) Vd regimen in the target patient population (i.e. adult patients with MM 
who  have  received  at  least  one  prior  therapy),  which  is  supported  by  several  secondary  endpoints. 
Despite the toxicity of this combination, it is considered that the benefits of the proposed combination 
outweigh its risks.  
5.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The results from the pivotal BOSTON study in support of this application were intended to fulfil the 
Specific Obligation (SOB) in the context of the Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) of Nexpovio 
(selinexor) which was granted on 26 March 2021. The SOB is now considered fulfilled. The data from 
the BOSTON study confirms a positive B/R balance for selinexor in the sought indication and constitute 
a comprehensive data package supporting granting of a marketing authorisation no longer subject to 
specific obligations. 
5.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of selinexor in the claimed indication is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

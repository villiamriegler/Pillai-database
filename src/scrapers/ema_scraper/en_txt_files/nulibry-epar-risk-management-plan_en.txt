Brief description of the 
product 
Chemical class: Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP)  
Summary of mechanism: Patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) 
Type  A  have  mutations  in  the  MOCS1  gene,  leading  to  deficient  MOCS1A/B 
dependent  synthesis  of  the  intermediate  substrate,  cPMP.    Substrate  replacement 
therapy with NULIBRY provides an exogenous source of cPMP, which is converted 
to molybdopterin. Molybdopterin is then converted to molybdenum cofactor, which 
is needed for the activation of molybdenum-dependent enzymes, including sulphite 
oxidase (SOX), an enzyme that reduces levels of neurotoxic sulphites.

PART II: 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
There is no reference product available on the market. 
PART II:  MODULE SI - EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION AND TARGET 
POPULATION 
II.1 Indication 
NULIBRY is indicated for the treatment of patients with MoCD Type A. 
II.2 Incidence  
Two-thirds of MoCD patients have Type A, which is due to a mutation in the MOCS1 gene 
localized on chromosome 6p21.3 which leads to a complete lack of MOCS1A/B enzyme activity 
with no formation of cPMP (Reiss and Hahnewald, 2011).   
Inherited metabolic disorders are a heterogeneous group of conditions known cumulatively to 
affect approximately one in 800 neonates. MoCD is an ultra-rare subgroup of these inherited 
conditions with an unknown incidence.  Initial estimates predicted that it occurs in less than one 
in 100,000 to 200,000 new-borns worldwide.  This incidence range was established by assuming 
similarity between MoCD and other rare monogenic diseases that at the time were better 
characterised.  To date more than 100 cases of MoCD have been reported in the literature, 
representing numerous ethnic groups with significant prevalence in areas of high consanguinity 
(Bayram et al., 2013; Hinderhofer et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 1980; Mendel, 2013; Reiss and 
Johnson, 2003). MoCD is therefore thought to be underdiagnosed with the actual number of 
affected individuals likely to be higher (Atwal and Scaglia, 2016). While the initial incidence 
assumption helped to establish MoCD as a rare genetic disease, global reports and an improved 
understanding of the disease suggest a correction to the incidence should be performed.  This is 
supported by the growing belief that the original incidence estimate is most likely representative 
of sulphite intoxication diseases as a whole. Work done recently by researchers in Germany and 
presented at the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism in 2018 and 2019 
endeavoured to address this issue (Mayr et al., 2019; Mayr et al., 2018b).  With the recent 
availability of variant databases assembled from large and multi-ethnic populations, such as the 
Exome Aggregation Consortium (Lek et al., 2016), a systematic and potentially powerful tool for 
investigating the incidence of rare genetic diseases now exists. While not without limitations, 
disease incidence for high penetrance and recessive disorder estimations are made possible by 
traditional calculations utilising the Hardy-Weinberg equation and allelic frequencies of 
represented variants (Schrodi et al., 2015). Utilising a conservative and less conservative variant 
dataset with associated pathogenicity scores, the researchers calculated that MoCD Type A 
incidence is within the range of one in 341,690 to 411,187. 
II.2 Prevalence  
From the information available at the time of the original European Union (EU) orphan drug 
designation (ODD) application in March 2010, the prevalence was estimated to be under 
200 patients worldwide, well below the orphan drug threshold of 5 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Community.  The literature review, search, and identification of published MoCD cases 
done in 2010 for the initial ODD application identified a total of 128 cases of MoCD between 
1977 and 2009, including 59 MoCD in Europe (13 in the United Kingdom [UK]).

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
For the initial ODD, the prevalence of MoCD was estimated to be less than 0.01 per 
10,000 inhabitants in 2010.  The prevalence of MoCD Type A was reassessed based on PubMed 
and Embase literature searches between 2010 and 2020 and following the same methodology.  A 
total of 20 publications, reporting cases of any types of MoCD in the EU, were identified; among 
those a total of 53 MoCD Type A cases were reported leading to an estimated prevalence of 
MoCD Type A of 0.005 per 10,000 inhabitants.   
II.3 Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease 
To date, more than 100 cases of MoCD have been reported in the literature, representing 
numerous ethnic groups with significant prevalence in areas of high consanguinity (Bayram et al., 
2013; Hinderhofer et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 1980; Mendel, 2013; Reiss and Johnson, 2003).  
Nearly half of patients with MoCD present with symptoms within the first day of life, and 
approximately three-quarters exhibit symptoms leading to diagnosis within the first month 
Mechler et al., 2015)  Signs and symptoms are progressive, and in the absence of treatment, 
patients usually die in early childhood due to neurologic degeneration (Reiss and Hahnewald, 
2011). 
II.4 The main existing treatment options 
Current treatment options are symptom driven to provide relief from clinical manifestations of 
the disease (e.g., antiepileptic drugs [AEDs] for seizures) and supportive care, such as placement 
of a feeding tube.  These symptomatic treatments have no impact on the continued neurologic 
injury related to elevated levels of S-sulfocysteine (SSC) that lead to the significant 
developmental disabilities.  Although AEDs are available for treatment of seizures, chronic 
epilepsy refractory to AED therapy does occur in patients with MoCD Type A (Giza et al., 2009; 
Laxer et al., 2014). Once widespread neural cell death occurs in the brain, the damage is unable 
to be reversed by cPMP.  Therefore, it is critical to intervene as soon as possible by initiating 
substrate replacement therapy immediately after birth, even prior to genetic confirmation of 
MoCD Type A to maximise the potential for a positive clinical outcome in patients who present 
with clinical and laboratory manifestations of the disease. Substrate replacement therapy with 
fosdenopterin fills this unmet need.  If fosdenopterin is started before sulphite-induced neuronal 
injury and structural brain damage occurs, the child’s survival, growth and development have 
been shown to improve relative to an untreated control group (see Module 2.7.3, Section 3.3). 
In the United States (US), fosdenopterin (NULIBRY) is approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and is the only treatment approved for MoCD Type A; it is indicated to 
reduce the risk of mortality in patients with MoCD Type A.  Outside of the US, there is no 
approved treatment for this serious and life-threatening disease. Fosdenopterin is the only 
treatment under clinical investigation in the EU that addresses the underlying substrate deficiency 
in patients with MoCD Type A.  
II.5 Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity 
MoCD is an ultra-rare, rapidly progressive, chronic, and mostly lethal, autosomal recessive 
inborn error of metabolism that typically exhibits an acute onset in neonates or in early infancy.  
Systematic quantitative natural-history data are not available. Shortly after birth, patients with 
MoCD usually present signs and symptoms such as intractable seizures, exaggerated startle 
reactions, axial hypotonia, limb hypertonia, gross destruction of the brain, failure to thrive, poor 
or halted feeding response, high pitch crying, metabolic acidosis, burst suppression or multifocal

epileptic electroencephalogram, and abnormal magnetic resonance imaging findings (Johnson et 
al., 2001; Mechler et al., 2015; van der Knaap and Valk, 2005).   
These characteristics collectively precede rapidly progressive neurodegeneration. In the absence 
of treatment, patients usually die within the first years of life and patients who survive this period 
usually develop encephalopathy and developmental delay, but survival with this condition has 
never been quantified (Mechler et al., 2015). 
MoCD can be classified based upon the affected gene, with mutations in MOCS1, 
MOCS2/MOCS3, and GPHN, classified as either Type A, B or C, respectively. It is important to 
note that the different types of MoCD are indistinguishable clinically and biochemically and that 
the diagnosis of the specific subtype of MoCD is confirmed by genetic testing, which may take 
several days to weeks to complete. For patients with MoCD Type A, mutations in the MOCS1 
gene, which are localised on chromosome 6p21.2, lead to deficient MOCS1A/B-dependent 
synthesis of the intermediate substrate cPMP (Shalata et al., 1998). In the absence of cPMP, 
molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) cannot be synthesized, with all molybdenum-dependent enzyme 
activity undetectable, most importantly SOX. This leads to the accumulation of toxic levels of 
sulphites and the secondary metabolite SSC resulting from deficient SOX activity. Xanthine 
oxidase (or xanthine dehydrogenase), aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime-reducing 
component are also MoCo dependent and inactivated when this cofactor is absent. 
The prognosis for patients with MoCD Type A is poor. Elevated levels of sulphite in the brain 
with formation of SSC lead to severe, rapidly progressive, and largely irreversible neuronal injury 
resulting in significant irreversible structural damage in the brain, including dilated ventricles, 
hydrocephalus, brain hypodensity, and brain atrophy (Johnson et al., 2001; Kumar et al., 2017; 
Reiss, 2016). The central nervous system injury has also been shown to occur in utero. Prenatal 
ultrasound in an infant who was subsequently found to have MoCD Type A showed diffuse brain 
damage (Carmi-Nawi et al., 2011). The neurological injury leads to the clinical manifestations of 
the disease, including seizures, feeding difficulties, axial hypotonia with limb hypertonia, 
impairment in growth, and significantly delayed cognitive and motor development. Death 
commonly occurs in the neonatal period; however, there have been reported cases of a less severe 
phenotype, later disease onset, and longer-term survival (Mayr et al., 2018a) (Study MCD-502). 
The poor prognosis and early death in patients with MoCD Type A were confirmed based on 
results of the natural history study, Study ALX-MCD-502 (MCD-502). In this study, which 
included 37 patients with MoCD Type A, the survival probability at 1 year of age was 0.75 with a 
median overall survival (OS) of 46.7 months (3.9 years) (ISE Table 1.6.1.1.1). Among the 
33 patients with onset of the signs and symptoms of the disease within 28 days of birth, the 
survival probability at 1 year of age was 0.72 with a median OS of 47.8 months (4.0 years) (ISE 
Table 1.6.1.1.2). This study also confirmed the morbidity of the disease. Overall, 92% of the 
patients had experienced seizures, 89% were unable to sit independently at any time, and 62% 
were not able to feed orally (ISE, Table 1.3.1.1.1, Table 1.11.1.1.1, and Table 1.8.1.1.1). Other 
sequelae of MoCD Type A reported in >50% of the 37 patients included hypertonicity (86%), 
developmental delays (84%), hypotonia (70%), microcephaly (62%), dysmorphic features (59%), 
myoclonus (54%), and spastic tetraplegia (51%) (CSR MCD-502, Table 14.1.3.2.1). “Clinically 
significant medical events” (including significant infections, respiratory events, and 
exacerbations of seizures) were reported as disease observations during the prospective data 
collection period in Study MCD-502 (CSR MCD-502, Listing 16.2.6.12.1). The most frequently 
reported events were infections, primarily reports of lower respiratory tract infections 
(pneumonia, bronchitis) and urinary tract infections.

II.6 Important co-morbidities 
MoCD an autosomal recessive disease, characterised by a rapidly progressive severe neurological 
damage with nearly half of patients with MoCD presenting the symptoms within the first day of 
life, and approximately three-quarters exhibit symptoms leading to diagnosis within the first 
month.  Patients who overcome it present seizures, poor feeding, show a severe mental disability, 
prostration in bed, poor growth and very poor quality of life (Martínez et al., 2020).  
Considering that MoCD is a very serious pathology that usually causes death in the immediate 
neonatal period, the diagnosis of co-morbidities apart from symptoms linked to the progressive 
neurodegeneration can be challenging.  Lens dislocation is often reported but only in children 
surviving the neonatal period (Mechler et al., 2015) with a detection after 4-5 years of age (Scelsa 
et al., 2019). Other ocular abnormalities associated with MoCD include spherophakia, iris 
coloboma, nystagmus, enophthalmos, and cerebral blindness (van der Knaap and Valk, 2005).  
Isolated, slight elevations of fibrinogen have also been reported, as an indirect sign of 
inflammatory cascade activation (Scelsa et al., 2019).  MoCD patients also present clinical 
findings including facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, hypotonia, and renal stones (Zaki et al., 
2016).

PART II:  MODULE SII-NONCLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
All nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology studies described here were 
conducted by or for Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion), or Origin Biosciences, Inc. 
(Origin).  All definitive safety pharmacology and toxicology studies conducted with 
fosdenopterin in support of clinical development and registration were conducted in either the US 
or Canada in compliance with US FDA or Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. 
The nonclinical development programme for fosdenopterin was discussed with the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) during the development of the product as part of an EMA protocol 
assistance held in 2014. 
Pharmacology Programme: A series of in vitro and in vivo studies representing the Core Battery 
of safety pharmacology studies described in the (International Council for Harmonisation of 
Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite 
Guideline) and (ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline S7B) was conducted to investigate the 
effects of fosdenopterin on vital physiological functions. In vitro and in vivo cardiovascular 
assessments were conducted as stand-alone studies. In line with (ICH Harmonised Tripartite 
Guideline M3(R2)) to reduce animal use, central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory 
assessments were incorporated into the repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in rats and dogs.  
Pharmacodynamic (PD) drug interaction studies with fosdenopterin have not been conducted.   
Toxicology Programme: The fosdenopterin toxicology programme is consistent with the 
guidance provided in the (ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline M3(R2))and is in accordance 
with clinical development of fosdenopterin as a life-saving treatment of patients with MoCD 
Type A.   
In order to expedite availability of fosdenopterin to patients in critical need of immediate therapy, 
no reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted with fosdenopterin.  A 
carcinogenicity study in a single rodent species will be conducted post-approval.

Safety Pharmacology 
The core battery of safety pharmacology studies conducted with fosdenopterin, included in vitro 
assessment of fosdenopterin at key cardiac ion channels and in vivo studies of fosdenopterin-related 
effects on the central nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems at dose up to 100 mg/kg in rats 
and 10 mg/kg in dogs.  The safety pharmacology investigations did not indicate any undesirable 
pharmacodynamics effects of fosdenopterin on physiological functions in relation to exposure in the 
therapeutic range and above. No functional changes in vital organs or systems which are likely to be of 
importance in clinical testing of fosdenopterin were identified (Module 2.6.2, Section 4).

Single-Dose and Repeat-Dose Toxicity Studies 
Single-Dose Toxicity Study: 
Single intravenous (IV) (bolus) doses of fosdenopterin were administered in an exploratory study 
conducted in male rats to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of fosdenopterin formulated in 
two vehicles. In this study, fosdenopterin was well tolerated when administered acutely at doses ≤100 
mg/kg (Module 2.6.6, Section 2.1). 
Repeat-Dose Toxicity Studies: 
Definitive general toxicology studies were conducted in standard-aged rats (approximately 6 weeks of 
age at receipt) and dogs (approximately 5.5 to 6.5 months of age at receipt) administered fosdenopterin 
via 2-hour IV infusion once daily for 14 consecutive days.  In these studies, the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) for fosdenopterin was 10 mg/kg/day, the highest dose level evaluated, in both 
species.  
Steady-state systemic exposure (combined-sex area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)) 
to fosdenopterin at the NOAEL was 4,580 ng*h/mL in rats (maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 
2950 ng/mL) and 14,300 ng*h/mL in dogs (Cmax of 7050 ng/mL) (Module 2.6.6, Section 3).

Type of Non-Clinical Study 
To assess the safety and use of fosdenopterin in the paediatric population, several repeat-dose toxicity 
studies were performed in rats and dogs juvenile at initiation of treatments.  As MoCD type A patients 
are mostly new-borns, dosing in juvenile animals was initiated as soon as practical, and animals were 
treated until adulthood and up to 26 weeks and 9 months in rats and dogs, respectively, to assess the 
potential adverse effects of fosdenopterin.  In rats, the route of fosdenopterin administration was 
switched from subcutaneous (SC) to IV injection (bolus; lateral tail vein) beginning on post-natal day 
(PND) 21.  In dogs, daily SC dosing was either replaced by or supplemented with IV injection (bolus; 
peripheral vein) beginning on lactation day (LD) 26 (Module 2.6.6, Section 3). 
Special assessments incorporated into the design of these studies included sexual maturation, 
behavioural performance, and bone measurements.  In addition, each study included assessment of 
recovery from fosdenopterin-related findings after a 4-week treatment-free period.  In both studies, the 
high-dose levels evaluated (5 mg/kg/day in rats and 10 mg/kg/day in dogs) were justified as a 
maximum practical dose based on solubility limitations imposed by the test article (fosdenopterin) and 
dose volume limitations defined by the age/size of the animals and the route(s) of administration 
employed (Module 2.6.6, Section 3).  
In these chronic toxicity studies, no evidence of target organ toxicity was noted in either species at any 
dose level evaluated.  The NOAELs for fosdenopterin were 5 mg/kg/day (rats) and 10 mg/kg/day 
(dogs), the highest dose levels evaluated.  Steady-state systemic exposure (combined-sex AUC) to 
fosdenopterin at the NOAEL in these studies was 7,630 ng*h/mL in rats (Cmax of 16900 ng/mL) and 
29,700 ng*h/mL in dogs (Cmax of 15600 ng/mL) at the end of the treatment period (Module 2.6.6, 
Section 3). 
A study was also conducted in rats to explore the feasibility and tolerability of an alternative vehicle, 
which would allow administration of a 100 mg/kg/day maximum daily dose by IV (bolus) injection.  
As fosdenopterin formulated in this alternative vehicle was found to be well-tolerated by rats when 
administered once daily for seven consecutive days (Study 1727-016), a 13-week sub chronic toxicity 
study (9000563) was conducted in rats with this alternative formulation.  As in the chronic 26-week rat 
toxicity study, dosing was initiated in juvenile animals on PND 7 using the SC route of administration; 
treatment continued for 13 weeks, with a switch to IV (bolus) dosing beginning on PND 21.  The study 
design included recovery assessments and evaluation of sexual maturation, behavioural performance, 
and bone measurements.  As in the 26-week study conducted in rats, no test article-related ante- or 
post-mortem findings were noted in this study when fosdenopterin was administered daily to rats at 
dosages up to 100 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks.  The NOAEL for fosdenopterin in this study was

established at 100 mg/kg/day.  Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC0-t) to fosdenopterin at the NOAEL 
on PND 97 was 173,000 ng/mL and 140,000 ng*h/mL, respectively, in males and 189,000 ng/mL and 
127,000 ng*h/mL, respectively, in females (Module 2.6.6, Section 3). 
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity studies conducted with fosdenopterin, in line with Option 1 battery of ICH 
Harmonized Tripartite Guideline S2(R1) , included in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assays, in vitro 
chromosome aberration assays conducted in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in vivo (rat) 
bone marrow micronucleus assays.  Each study was conducted in duplicate.  In the first set of studies, 
fosdenopterin concentrations/dosages evaluated did not meet the maximum dose levels recommended 
in the ICH S2(R1) guideline.  In the second set of studies, the in vitro assays were conducted at 
concentrations up to and including the ICH-stipulated maximum dose levels of 5000 μg/plate (bacterial 
mutation assay) and 1 mM (mammalian cytogenetics assay), and the in vivo study was conducted at 
doses up to and including the maximum feasible dose (200 mg/kg/day with a volume of administration 
of 20 mL/kg).  In the bacterial reverse mutation assays, fosdenopterin was negative (non-mutagenic) in 
both assays.  In the in vitro chromosome aberration assays, fosdenopterin was negative (non-
clastogenic) in both assays (Module 2.6.6, Section 4.1).  In the in vivo (rat) bone marrow micronucleus 
assays, IV administration of fosdenopterin was not toxic to the bone marrow and did not result in any 
substantial increases in the incidence of micronucleated immature erythrocytes (Module 2.6.6, Section 
4.5 and Module 2.6.6, Section 4.6).  Taken together, the results of this genotoxicity testing battery 
indicate that fosdenopterin does not pose a genotoxic hazard to humans.

Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted in support of fosdenopterin 
registration in EU.  
Per the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline M3(R2): “Reproduction toxicity studies should be 
conducted as is appropriate for the population that is to be exposed”. Origin’s global clinical 
development programme comprises of pre-pubescent patients with MoCD Type A who are currently 
receiving fosdenopterin treatment.  
None of these patients will be of reproductive age or clinical condition to experience puberty at the 
planned time of Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) submission. 
Also, in sub-chronic and chronic toxicology studies conducted in animals exposed to fosdenopterin 
beginning on PND 7 (rats) or LD 5 or 6 (dogs), daily parenteral administration of fosdenopterin for up 
to 26 (rats) or 39 (dogs) weeks resulted in no test article-related macroscopic, organ weight or 
microscopic findings in reproductive tract organs/tissues of either species at either the terminal or 
recovery necropsy intervals. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to fosdenopterin 
beginning prior to sexual maturity and continuing into adulthood is unlikely to have an adverse effect 
on fertility in either males or females.  
Relevance to Human Usage: Yes 
Although the findings from chronic and 
sub-chronic studies suggest that long-
term exposure to fosdenopterin 
beginning prior to sexual maturity and 
continuing into adulthood is unlikely to 
have an adverse effect on fertility in 
either males or females, the potential 
adverse effects of fosdenopterin on the 
developing embryo/foetus remain 
unknown.  
Given the nature of the product 
(substrate replacement therapy) and the 
patient population/indication, it is 
Applicant’s view that pregnancy and 
lactation will be an unlikely event in the 
targeted population group. However, 
considering the expected extended life 
expectancy with the NULIBRY 
treatment, “Use during Pregnancy and

Phototoxicity 
Fosdenopterin has been characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectrometry for several batches.  
As fosdenopterin contains a pyrimidone chromophore, it is expected to absorb between 200 nm and 
400 nm.  The UV spectra were acquired concomitantly to ultra-performance liquid chromatography 
(UPLC) data acquisition using a variable wavelength or photo diode array UV/visible detector, 
scanning from 200 to 400 nm.  Fosdenopterin profile consists of three absorbance maxima at 220 nm, 
254 nm, and 291 nm and has no absorbance above 400 nm.  Extinction coefficients were not 
determined.  
The absorptions are consistent with structure and literature description (Clinch et al., 2013).  In 
addition, in the quantitative whole-body assay (QWBA) conducted in rats, fosdenopterin was found to 
be highly distributed in skin (Module 2.6.4, Section 4.1). 
The following 2 nonclinical studies were conducted with fosdenopterin to evaluate phototoxic 
potential: 
Study 20181580-Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Assay of ORGN001 in BALB/c 3T3 Mouse 
Fibroblasts: Results of this study, expressed as Photo Irritancy Factor (PIF) and Mean 
Phototoxic Effect (MPE) of >5.043 and >5.503 (PIF) and 0.326 and 0.380 (MPE) demonstrated 
phototoxic potential, and as OECD 432-recommended cell survival, OD540 criteria, and 
promethazine cytotoxicity and phototoxicity criteria were met, the definitive assays were 
considered valid (Module 2.6.6, Section 8.2).  
In conclusion, fosdenopterin (≤100 μg/mL) demonstrated phototoxic potential.  The PIF and 
MPE criteria for a phototoxic response are >5 and >0.15, respectively.

pigmented rats for three consecutive days followed by ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure 
resulted in dose-dependent cutaneous skin reactions (erythema, oedema, flaking, and eschar) 
and fosdenopterin -related ophthalmic and histopathologic changes indicative of phototoxicity.

PART II:  MODULE SIII-CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE   
The clinical development of cPMP for the treatment of patients with MoCD Type A was initiated 
in 2009 by Colbourne Pharmaceuticals (previously known as Orphatec Pharmaceuticals GmbH).  
Colbourne had developed a recombinant form of cPMP (rcPMP) of Escherichia coli strain. E. 
coli-derived rcPMP was shown to be structurally identical to endogenous cPMP (Santamaria-
Araujo et al., 2004; Santamaria-Araujo et al., 2012).   
The Colbourne product and programme were acquired by Alexion in 2011 who then developed a 
chemical synthetic process for cPMP.  The core molecular structures of rcPMP and fosdenopterin 
(NULIBRY) have been compared using multiple spectral techniques as well as in-vitro efficacy 
assays, and it has been established that rcPMP and NULIBRY have identical core structures 
(Modules 3.2.S.3.1 and 3.2.S.2.6).  In addition to demonstrating that both cPMP molecules have 
identical core structures, their biologic comparability has been demonstrated in in vitro and in 
vivo pharmacodynamic studies in animals and humans.   
Leveraging the nonclinical data, Alexion initiated 4 global clinical studies as detailed below, and 
a natural history study.  However, in July 2017, Alexion stopped recruitment in Study 
ALXN1101-MCD-202 (MCD-202).  Subsequently, Origin acquired all assets in relation to 
fosdenopterin from Alexion, and effective 26 September 2018, resumed clinical trial agreement 
(CTA) and investigational new drug (IND) sponsorship for these global studies. Origin's 
acquisition of the programme has allowed for re-initiation of recruitment in Study MCD-202 and 
the continuation of the development of fosdenopterin as a substrate replacement therapy for the 
life-saving treatment of patients with MoCD Type A.  Origin also assumed sponsorship of study 
ALXN1101-MCD-201 (MCD-201) from Alexion. 
Below is an overview of the four clinical studies to evaluate safety: 
•  Study ALXN1101-MCD-101 (MCD-101), a completed first-in-human Phase 1, 
single dose, dose-escalation, placebo-controlled study conducted in healthy adult 
volunteers. 
•  Study MCD-501, a completed retrospective study in patients with MoCD Types 
A and B (or unknown type) treated under named-patient use with rcPMP. 
•  Study MCD-201, an ongoing prospective study of NULIBRY designed to 
transition paediatric patients with MoCD Type A who were receiving rcPMP 
under named-patient use to receive NULIBRY; the MAA data cut-off for this 
analysis is 31 October 2020. 
•  Study MCD-202, an ongoing prospective study of NULIBRY administered in 
treatment naïve neonates, infants, and children up to 17 (inclusive) years of age 
with suspected or confirmed MoCD Type A; the MAA data cut-off for this 
analysis is 31 October 2020. 
Exposure Data 
A total of 15 neonatal and paediatric patients with MoCD Type A were treated across the 
three studies MCD-501, MCD-201, and MCD-202: 
•  Six of the 15 patients received both rcPMP in Study MCD-501 and NULIBRY in Study 
MCD-201,  
•  Four patients received only rcPMP in Study MCD-501,

NULIBRY (fosdenopterin) 9.5 mg powder for solution for injection 
       1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
•  Two patients received rcPMP outside of a clinical study (named-patient use) (who did not 
contribute to study MCD-501) and then received NULIBRY in Study MCD-201, and 
•  Three patients received NULIBRY in Study MCD-202. 
As of the data cut-off date for this MAA submission, 10 of the 15 patients remained on treatment 
with NULIBRY, including eight patients in Study MCD201 and two patients in Study MCD202.  
Four patients received only rcPMP in study MCD-501 and did not continue onto study MCD201.  
Two patients with MoCD Type A in Study MCD501 had died and two other patients were 
reported as no longer receiving rcPMP.   
In addition to these there were two additional patients in Study MCD-202 who received 
NULIBRY treatment, but had to discontinue the treatment after few days (respectively 10 days 
and 17 days) of treatment due to being confirmed as not having a diagnosis of MoCD Type A.  
These two patients are not presented in Table 4 as this table represents details of only patients 
with MoCD Type A. 
Across the 15 treated patients, age at first dose was ≤ 14 days for 11 of the 15 patients with six 
patients initiating treatment at 1 day of age.  The maximum time to initiate cPMP treatment 
across all 15 patients was 1015 days (CSR MCD-202, Listing 16.2.4.1).  An overview of the 
extent of exposure to cPMP, including information for each of the 15 patients by dose level of 
rcPMP and of NULIBRY is provided in Table 4.  Note that during the time between the last 
reported treatment with rcPMP collected in Study MCD-501 and initiation of treatment with 
NULIBRY in Study MCD-201, there is a gap in documentation of dosing for the six patients who 
were included in both studies.  A summary of the duration of the gap between Study MCD-501 
informed consent (last dose date) and the first dose administration date in Study MCD-201, 
which ranged from 1 to 2.3 years, is provided in Module 2.7.3, Table 13.  Based on the data 
collected for patients in Study MCD-201 as part of the prior medication history, no gap in dosing 
between rcPMP and NULIBRY was confirmed for four of these six patients who were included 
in both studies (CSR MCD-201, Listing 16.2.4.7.1). Origin has also conducted a review of 
shipping records available for named patient use and other relevant available data, including 
biomarker levels upon exit in Study MCD-501 and baseline in Study MCD-201.  This 
information is consistent with the patients receiving continued treatment with rcPMP during this 
period. 
Overall patient-years of exposure to cPMP, from the first dose of rcPMP to the last dose of 
NULIBRY as of the MAA data cut-off across the 15 treated patients was substantial at 83.0 
patient years (ISE Table 1.5.1.1.1). Median total time on cPMP was 1960 days (5.4 years) and 
ranged from 6 days to 4896 days (13.4 years).  Among the 10 patients who received rcPMP in 
Study MCD-501, median time on treatment was 559 days (1.5 years) and ranged from 6 days to 
1610 days (4.4 years).  Among the 11 patients who received NULIBRY, median time on 
treatment as of the data cut-off was 2316.0 days (6.3 years) and ranged from 9.0 days to 
2762 days (7.6 years); total patient years of exposure to NULIBRY was 55.9 years. (ISE Table 
1.5.1.1.1) 
Most patients in Study MCD-501 and all patients who received NULIBRY had the dose of cPMP 
titrated over the course of treatment.  Due to the named patient treatment plans, a variety of doses 
and titration schemes were employed across the patients in Study MCD-501.  In Study MCD-201, 
the initial dose of NULIBRY was matched to the patient’s dose of rcPMP upon entering the 
study.  After the first 2 months of treatment with NULIBRY, the dose was increased every month 
through Month 5 by no more than 240 μg/kg/day if the patient’s clinical, pharmacokinetic, and 
safety assessments permitted, including the absence of signs and symptoms of drug-related

toxicity.  The maximum dose administered in this study was 1200 µg/kg/day.  Similar to Study 
MCD-201, Study MCD-202 also used a dose titration scheme-here the initial dose was based on 
GA.  For term neonates (≥ 37 weeks GA), the initial NULIBRY dose was 700 μg/kg/day and for 
preterm neonates (< 37 weeks GA), 525 μg/kg/day.  Thereafter, the dose was to be incrementally 
increased on Day 28 and at Months 3, 6, and 9 if the patient’s clinical, pharmacokinetic, 
pharmacodynamic, and safety assessments permitted, including the absence of signs and 
symptoms of drug-related toxicity.  Initially, the dose in Study MCD-202 could be increased to 
up to 1300 µg/kg/day.  However, as of Protocol Amendment 3, in order to simplify the dosing 
and titration schedule, the dose escalation plan was changed to include a maximum dose of 
1200 µg/kg/day.  In both studies, the patient’s data were reviewed by a Safety Review Committee 
in conjunction with a Data Monitoring Committee prior to each dose escalation to ensure the 
safety of treatment.   
Overall, seven of the 11 patients who received NULIBRY were escalated to a maximum dose per 
protocol (1200 or 1300 µg/kg/day).  Three patients in Study MCD 201 were escalated to a 
maximum dose of 960 µg/kg/day; one was maintained at that dose level based on 
pharmacokinetic assessments and two were dose reduced to a final dose of 240 µg/kg/day and 
480 µg/kg/day, respectively, based on parent request for ease of administration and not due to 
safety issues (CSR MCD 201, Section 12.1).

Demographic Characteristics 
Demographic characteristics are summarized by study and across all 15 patients with MoCD 
Type A treated with cPMP in Table 5. 
The gender distribution among the 15 patients with MoCD Type A who received cPMP was 
balanced (46.7% male and 53.3% female); 11 of 15 patients (73.3%) were white and 13 of 15 
patients (86.7%) were not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Median GA was 39.0 weeks and 
ranged from 35 to 41 weeks. Median age at genetic diagnosis was 4.0 days across the 15 patients 
and included six patients with a prenatal diagnosis.  All patients (except one) had onset of MoCD 
signs and symptoms within the first month after birth; median time to onset of signs and 
symptoms was 1.0 day. For the subject signs and symptoms were presented at 12 months of age.  
The most commonly reported presenting signs and symptoms were seizures (66.7%), feeding 
difficulties (60.0%) and high-pitched cry (46.7%).

PART II:  MODULE SIV-POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL TRIALS    
SIV.1 Exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the development programme 
The exclusion criteria that are related to ongoing or recent conditions or treatments that may 
impact the safety and efficacy assessment of NULIBRY from study MCD-201 and MCD-202 are 
listed below and not discussed further: 
•  Current or planned treatment with another investigational drug or device, with the 
exception of rcPMP treatment, through Day -1 
•  Diagnosis other than MoCD Type A (may be determined after the initiation of study drug) 
•  Condition that is considered by the treating physician to be a contraindication to therapy, 
including evidence of abnormalities on brain imaging not attributable to MoCD Type A, 
or that might otherwise interfere with the patient’s participation in the study, pose any 
additional risk for the patient, or confound patient assessments. 
The following exclusion criterion from pivotal study MCD-501 is not discussed further since this 
was a retrospective, observational, noninterventional study for patients with MoCD who have 
been previously treated with cPMP: 
•  Patient's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) are unable to understand the nature and scope of 
the study. 
The following exclusion criteria from pivotal study MCD-502 are not discussed further since this 
was a natural history program:   
•  Patient has participated in Study ALX-MCD-501. 
• 
If patient has received treatment with cPMP, only data up to date and time immediately 
prior to first administration of cPMP will be collected. 
The remaining exclusion criteria from the pivotal studies are presented below in Table 6 and may 
be grouped together. 
Table 6.  Remaining exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the development 
programme 
Exclusion criterion 
Study MCD-202: Antenatal and/or postnatal brain imaging prior to initiation of 
treatment with ORGN001 that indicates cortical or subcortical cystic 
encephalomalacia, clinically significant intracranial haemorrhage, or other 
abnormalities on brain imaging determined by the treating physician to be 
clinically significant. 
Cortical or subcortical cystic encephalomalacia and significant intracranial 
haemorrhage are conditions in which neonates experience brain injury, softening or loss 
of brain tissue either by asphyxia (oxygen deprivation during or around the time of 
birth) or other reasons. 
Reason for exclusion 
These conditions/characteristics coincide with the characteristics of MoCD Type A.  
The presence of these conditions in any neonate questions the confirmation of MoCD 
Type A, which is the targeted indication for NULIBRY. 
Elevated levels of sulphite in the brain with formation of SSC lead to severe, rapidly 
progressive, and largely irreversible neuronal injury resulting in significant irreversible

structural damage in the brain, including dilated ventricles, hydrocephalus, brain 
hypodensity, and brain atrophy (Johnson et al., 2001; Kumar et al., 2017; Reiss, 2016). 
The central nervous system injury has also been shown to occur in utero. Prenatal 
ultrasound at 35 weeks gestation in an infant who was subsequently found to have 
MoCD Type A showed diffuse brain damage with multiple subcortical cavities, 
ventriculomegaly, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, and a hypoplastic cerebellum 
with an enlarged cisterna magna (Carmi-Nawi et al., 2011).  
Is it considered to be 
included as missing 
information? 
No 
Rationale  
This was a general risk consideration in experimental treatment/setting.  Post approval 
NULIBRY will be indicated for patients with MoCD Type A (SmPC, Section 4.1).  In 
real-life situations, patients with the beforementioned conditions/characteristics may be 
candidates for treatment.  Clinicians will need to determine whether the benefit of 
treatment outweighs risks for an individual patient. 
This is not considered as a missing information. 
Exclusion criterion 
Study MCD-202: Modified Glasgow Coma Scale (mGCS) for Infants and Children 
score of less than 7 for more than 24 hours (does not apply to children less than 1 
day in age). 
Reason for exclusion 
The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a clinical tool designed to assess coma and impaired 
consciousness.  A modified GCS score of 12 in infants or children suggests a severe 
head injury, a score of 8 suggests need for intubation and ventilation, and a score of 6 
suggests need for intracranial pressure monitoring.  
Is it considered to be 
included as missing 
information? 
No 
Rationale  
This was a general risk consideration in experimental treatment/setting.  
Patients with a mGCS of less than 7 for more than 24 hours have a high risk of 
mortality1.  Although children do better than adults with a comparable injury, the high 
baseline risk of subsequent disability with persistent neurologic sequelae is a factor that 
would interfere for a proper assessment of the study treatment. 
The exclusion of this population is not considered as missing information.

Not included in the clinical development programme.  There are no available data on 
NULIBRY use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major 
birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or foetal outcomes. 
As per the proposed SmPC section 4.6, NULIBRY is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  
However, considering the expected extended life expectancy with the NULIBRY 
treatment “Use during Pregnancy and Lactation” is considered as a missing 
information.   
Not included in the clinical development programme. There are no human or animal 
data to assess the presence of NULIBRY or its metabolites in human milk, the 
effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production for the mother. 
As per the proposed SmPC section 4.6, a risk to new-borns/infants cannot be 
excluded.  A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to 
discontinue from NULIBRY therapy taking into account the benefit of breast 
feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. However, 
considering the expected extended life expectancy with the NULIBRY treatment 
“Use during Pregnancy and Lactation” is considered as a missing information.

Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns (presented below) are 
based on nonclinical data and on data from two open-label, single-arm studies (MCD-201 (n=8) 
and MCD-202 (n=3), in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MoCD Type A (8 of the 
11 patients were previously treated with cPMP). In these studies, patients received a daily IV 
administration of NULIBRY.

Safety Concern 
Important 
Potential Risk: 
Medication 
Errors in the 
Home Setting 
Missing 
Information: 
Use During 
Pregnancy and 
Lactation 
Justification for risk-benefit impact 
Treatment with NULIBRY is to be initiated in the hospital setting.  Home administration of 
NULIBRY can be performed by the caregiver if deemed appropriate by the HCP.  Treatment 
with NULIBRY requires specific storage, dosing and administration which may increase the 
possibility of medication errors in the home setting. Therefore, “Medication errors in the 
home setting’ is considered as an important potential risk   
The proposed SmPC (sections 4.2, 6.4 and 6.6) describes the dosing and method of 
administration, storage conditions and special precautions for disposal and handling of 
NULIBRY including special instructions for home administration.  The healthcare provider 
(HCP) should calculate and provide the volume of NULIBRY in millilitres (mL) and the 
number of vials needed for each dose to the caregiver/patient. The caregiver/patient must 
read and follow carefully the detailed ‘Instructions for the user’ provided in the carton on the 
preparation, administration, storage, and disposal of NULIBRY (more details in Part V.2). 
Risk-benefit impact:  
NULIBRY is intended for IV use and must be given daily throughout the patient’s life.  The 
Applicant believes the benefit of administering this life-saving treatment at home outweighs 
the potential risks of medication errors in the home setting. 
NULIBRY has a wide safety margin and no adverse events related to dosing have been 
reported thus far in clinical trials or in the global post-marketing setting.  Furthermore, 
mitigation steps have been taken in the SmPC, Package Leaflet (PL), the IFU and Infusion 
Diary (ID).  Therefore, there is no significant impact on the risk-benefit balance of 
NULIBRY which remains positive.  
Although the findings from nonclinical chronic and sub-chronic studies suggest that long-
term exposure to fosdenopterin beginning prior to sexual maturity and continuing into 
adulthood is unlikely to have an adverse effect on fertility in either males or females, the 
potential adverse effects of fosdenopterin on the developing embryo/foetus remains 
unknown.  
Currently there are no available data on NULIBRY in pregnant or lactating women to 
evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or 
foetal outcomes. 
However, the patients in the clinical development program are now growing.  Although 
these patients are at an age of reproductive potential, due to their clinical condition, in 
reality, they are not considered of reproductive potential.  Considering the expected extended 
life expectancy of the target population with the NULIBRY treatment, “Use during 
Pregnancy and Lactation” is considered as a missing information.   
The proposed SmPC (section 4.6) states that there is not or limited amount of data from the 
use of fosdenopterin in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to 
reproductive toxicity. Fosdenopterin is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Risk-benefit impact:  
Given the life-threatening nature of the disease, the need for long-term treatment with the 
product (as a substrate replacement therapy), and the patient population/indication, it is 
Applicant’s view that pregnancy and lactation will be an unlikely event in the targeted 
population group.  Despite this, the Applicant considers “Use during Pregnancy and 
Lactation” as a missing information due to the lack of data in such population.

NULIBRY (fosdenopterin) 9.5 mg powder for solution for injection 
       1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Given that NULIBRY will provide a life-saving treatment to patients with the ultra-rare 
disease of MoCD Type A, the overall benefit/risk balance of NULIBRY continues to be 
favourable. 
Long term safety is well established in neonates, infants and children. There is limited safety 
data available in adolescents and adults.  
The proposed SmPC (section 5.1) states that there are limited data in adolescents and adults. 
Missing 
information: 
Long term safety 
Risk –benefit impact 
Given the safety data available so far from the clinical trials, the pathophysiology of MoCD 
Type A and the known mechanism of action of NULIBRY, there is no reason to believe that 
the safety profile will be different in adolescents and adults compared to neonates, infants 
and children. Despite this, the Applicant considers “Long term safety” as a missing 
information as an approval of the NULIBRY MA application under exceptional 
circumstances indicates sufficient data are not available for full approval. 
Given that NULIBRY will provide a life-saving treatment to patients with the ultra-rare 
disease of MoCD Type A, the overall benefit/risk balance of NULIBRY continues to be 
favourable.

mechanisms 
Treatment with NULIBRY is to be initiated in the hospital setting.  Home administration 
of NULIBRY can be performed by the caregiver if deemed appropriate by the HCP.  
Treatment with NULIBRY requires specific storage, dosing, and administration, which 
may increase the possibility of medication errors in the home setting.

and strength of 
evidence 
Treatment with NULIBRY requires specific storage, dosing, and administration, which 
may increase the possibility of medication errors in the home setting.  Most patients 
(90%) in the clinical studies received NULIBRY which was administered by a caregiver 
in the home setting.  Across the 11 patients treated with NULIBRY, total exposure was 
55.9 patient-years (with median time on treatment, as of the data cut-off, of 6.3 years 
which ranged from 9.0 days to 7.6 years).   No adverse events related to dosing were 
reported throughout the clinical development program (~ 55.9 patient-years of exposure 
to NULIBRY treatment).   
Characterisation of 
the risk 
Treatment with NULIBRY is to be initiated in the hospital setting. Home administration 
can be performed by the caregiver if deemed appropriate by the HCP. Treatment with 
NULIBRY requires specific storage, dosing and administration which may increase the 
possibility of a medication error in the home setting.    
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Caregivers will need to be informed on the specific details for storage, dosing, and 
administration. Caregivers must fully understand the way NULIBRY should be stored, 
reconstituted and administered and the dose needed before they commence administration 
of NULIBRY in the home setting. Lack of this information is the main risk factor for 
medication errors in the home setting.   
No other particular risk factors or risk groups have been identified.

Important Potential Risk: Medication Errors in the Home Setting 
SmPC 
In the proposed SmPC, section 4.2 describes in detail the dosing recommendations for 
NULIBRY, and both section 4.2 and section 6.6 instruct the HCP to assess if home 
administration of NULIBRY is appropriate and to provide the dosing volume (mL) and 
the number of vials needed to prepare each dose to the caregiver. Section 6.4 contains the 
storage instructions. 
PL 
In the proposed PL, section 3 advises the caregiver/patient that their doctor or nurse will 
train them in how to prepare the medicine, how to give a dose of NULIBRY and to check 
with their doctor if they are not sure about how to use NULIBRY in the home setting. In 
addition, the caregiver/patient is advised that their doctor will work out the dose to give. 
In section 5, the storage conditions are given for both unopened vial and reconstituted 
NULIBRY as well instructions not to use the medicine if any particles are present or the 
solution is discoloured 
IFU  
As part of the training for home administration, the caregiver/patient must read the 
detailed instructions for the user (IFU) provided in the carton. The IFU contains step by 
step instructions in nontechnical language and visuals on the preparation, administration, 
storage, and disposal of NULIBRY to assist the caregivers.  The IFU is intended to 
reinforce the caregiver’s training and serve as a guide.  The IFU also advises the 
caregiver/patient that their doctor or nurse should show them the right way to prepare and 
give the prescribed dose of NULIBRY before administering for the first time, that the 
dose is based on age and body weight and that the doctor will work out the amount of 
NULIBRY needed for each dose in millilitres and number of vials (more details in Part 
V.2). 
Outer Carton 
The outer carton displays the storage conditions along with instructions for the 
caregiver/patient to read the package leaflet before use and that the product is for 
intravenous use after reconstitution. 
Infusion Diary 
The infusion diary is intended to function as a communication tool between the 
physician, the patient, and the caregiver to monitor safety, medication errors, and 
administration complications. This document will contain items outlined by the CHMP 
including emergency contact numbers, dates, doses administered, AEs, and medication 
errors and administration complications in the home setting. 
The benefits of NULIBRY include improvements in survival, biochemical markers and a 
positive impact on growth and development.  NULIBRY has been safely administered in 
the home-setting throughout the development program.  The proposed risk minimisation 
measures put in place support home administration of NULIBRY. 
Overall, the benefits that the patient receives from treatment with NULIBRY outweigh 
the potential risk patients will undergo due to medication errors in the home setting. 
Preventability 
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of 
the product 
Public health 
impact 
This important potential risk has very minimal impact on public health and the 
benefit/risk balance of NULIBRY continues to remain favourable.

SVII.3.2.  Presentation of the missing information  
Missing Information:  Use during Pregnancy and Lactation 
Non-Clinical Data: 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted in support 
of fosdenopterin registration in EU.  
In sub-chronic and chronic toxicology studies conducted in animals exposed to 
fosdenopterin beginning on PND 7 (rats) or LD 5 or 6 (dogs), daily parenteral 
administration of fosdenopterin for up to 26 (rats) or 39 (dogs) weeks resulted in no 
test article-related macroscopic, organ weight or microscopic findings in reproductive 
tract organs/tissues of either species at either the terminal or recovery necropsy 
intervals.  These findings suggest that long-term exposure to fosdenopterin beginning 
prior to sexual maturity and continuing into adulthood is unlikely to have an adverse 
effect on fertility in either males or females.  
Clinical Data: 
Currently there are no available data on NULIBRY’s use in pregnant or lactating 
women to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or 
adverse maternal or foetal outcomes. 
Considering the expected extended life expectancy of the target population with the 
NULIBRY treatment, “Use during Pregnancy and Lactation” is therefore considered 
as a missing information.   
Population in need of further characterisation are pregnant and lactating women. The 
potential adverse effects of fosdenopterin on the developing embryo/foetus remains 
unknown.   
Given the nature of the product (substrate replacement therapy), the patient 
population/indication; and given that NULIBRY is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception (as per the 
proposed SmPC section 4.6), it is Applicant’s view that pregnancy and lactation will 
be an unlikely event.  
Despite this, the Applicant plans to collect further information in this set of population 
(if any) by use of targeted follow-up questionnaire (Annex 4).    
Overall, this missing information has very minimal impact on public health and the 
benefit/risk balance of NULIBRY continues to remain favourable.

SVII.3.3.  Presentation of the missing information  
Missing Information:  Long term safety  
Evidence source 
Clinical Data: 
Long term safety for neonates, infants and children has been established in clinical 
trials. Due to the rarity of the disease, currently there is limited long term safety 
available, in particular for adolescents and adults.  
Therefore, “Long term safety” is considered as missing information given that an 
approval of the NULIBRY MA application under exceptional circumstances indicates 
sufficient data are not available for full approval.   
Population in need of 
further 
characterisation 
Given the safety data available so far, the pathophysiology of MoCD Type A and the 
mechanism of action of NULIBRY, there is no reason to believe that the safety and 
benefit/risk profile will be different for older patients compared to neonates, infants, 
and children. 
Despite this, the Applicant plans to implement a non-interventional post authorisation 
safety study (PASS) that will allow for the active collection of long-term safety data 
(primary objective) as well as efficacy data (secondary objective) (Annex 3).    
Overall, this missing information is expected to have no impact on public health and 
the benefit/risk balance of NULIBRY continues to remain favourable.

PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST-AUTHORISATION 
Comharsa has a pharmacovigilance system in place, which fulfils the European requirements and 
provides adequate evidence that Comharsa has the services of a qualified person responsible for 
pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the identification and notification of any 
potential risks occurring either in the Community or in a third country. 
Comharsa has put in place a Pharmacovigilance System Master File (PSMF) describing the set of 
activities required to fulfil the legal requirements for routine pharmacovigilance activities for the 
medicinal product(s) for which they are applying for in the EU. 
III.1  Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities include (but are not limited to): 
•  Collection, collation, assessment, and reporting of spontaneous reports; 
•  Periodic literature surveillance; and 
•  Signal detection activities. 
Routine pharmacovigilance practice includes comprehensive post-marketing surveillance 
assessment of spontaneously reported events with expedited reporting in compliance with 
worldwide regulatory requirements, and submission of Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) 
in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
Periodic safety evaluation of cumulative data will also be conducted to evaluate safety signals.  If 
a safety signal is identified, further assessment and characterisation of the safety signal will be 
conducted, including evaluation of individual case reports and aggregate data analysis. 
New safety information will be communicated to the regulatory authorities worldwide, in 
accordance with local regulations. Additional activities may include product label revisions and 
updates with new safety information, in discussion with regulatory authorities, and informational 
letters to the treating physicians. 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection: 
Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires for the safety concerns 
•  Targeted follow-up questionnaires for pregnancy and lactation, and medication errors in 
the home setting have been developed and will be available to collect and evaluate 
specific data related to these safety concerns to gain further information in the post-
marketing period (Annex 4).  
III.2  Additional pharmacovigilance activities  
The Applicant plans to implement the following additional pharmacovigilance activities:  
•  yearly updates that will provide new information concerning the safety and efficacy of 
Nulibry 
•  a post-marketing non-interventional post authorisation safety study (PASS) that will allow 
for the active collection of safety data and specific efficacy parameters of all treated 
patients (Annex 3).

V.2.  Additional risk minimisation measures  
Additional risk minimisation 1: Instructions for Use (IFU) 
Objectives:  
The objective of proposing IFU is to help caregivers/ patients completely understand various 
steps involved in the reconstitution and administration of NULIBRY.  This IFU contains step by 
step instructions, contains visuals for the majority of the steps, and uses typeface and white space 
to emphasise critical information.   
The IFU will contain statements that the doctor or nurse will show the patient/caregiver the right 
way to prepare and give the prescribed dose of NULIBRY before doing it for the first time; and 
that the doctor will work out the amount of NULIBRY needed for each dose in millilitres (mL) 
and the number of vials.  
The IFU will help patients/caregivers to function independently with minimal support from 
visiting home healthcare (HHC). 
This additional risk minimisation measure will focus on the following risk: 
•  Medication errors in the home setting 
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity: 
NULIBRY is intended for IV use and the treatment must be given daily throughout the patient’s 
life.  The treatment with NULIBRY is to be initiated in the hospital setting, however considering 
the life-long daily IV administration of NULIBRY, if home administration is deemed appropriate 
by the HCP, the administration of the product could be performed by the caregiver in the home 
setting.  Because reconstitution and administration of NULIBRY is likely to occur by the 
caregiver/patient in home setting, this IFU has been proposed as an additional risk minimisation 
measure.  
Target audience and planned distribution path: 
The target audience consists of the caregivers/patients who will reconstitute and administer 
NULIBRY to patient in home setting.

Product Code: H0005378 
NULIBRY (fosdenopterin) 9.5 mg powder for solution for injection 
       1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
The IFU will be part of NULIBRY’s packaging along with the PL.  IFUs will be distributed to 
caregivers/patients and should be used by HCPs when providing training to the caregiver for 
home administration of the product.  HCPs are expected to perform training of the caregiver 
before starting the NULIBRY treatment in the home setting.  
Administration of IV drugs in the out-patient setting typically requires coordination among the 
treating physician, hospital discharge planners, the patient’s health insurance plan, the 
caregiver/patient, home administration pharmacies, and, if needed, home health agencies.  
Visiting HHC often plays a role in home IV administrations.  HHC typically reinforces the 
physician training provided to the patient or caregiver on administration of the drug, provides 
education about side effects and goals of therapy, and visits periodically to assess the device site 
and provide dressing changes. 
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success: 
Effectiveness will be assessed using both process and outcome indicators. 
Process indicator: 
The distribution of the IFU can be considered as a process indicator and can be documented 
within each scheduled PSUR for NULIBRY. 
Outcome indicator: 
Origin commits to collecting all medication errors (with or without adverse events) and 
pregnancy and lactation reports from post-market experience.  Origin will perform routine 
pharmacovigilance activity to analyse the reported medication errors and cases of pregnancy or 
lactation. Origin also commits to additional PV activities in the form of a non-interventional 
PASS (Annex 3). All relevant data including AEs/SAEs will be presented within each PSUR. 
Additional risk minimisation 2: Infusion Diary 
Objectives:  
The Infusion Diary (ID) is intended to function as a communication tool between the physician, 
the patient, and the caregiver to monitor safety, medication errors, and administration 
complications in the home setting. This document will contain items outlined by the CHMP 
including emergency contact numbers, dates, doses administered, AEs, and medication errors and 
administration complications in the home setting.   
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity: 
This ID captures additional information to facilitate communication between the caregiver and 
treating physician, and to capture certain treatment information for review by the physician; 
thereby to minimize medication error. This ID will capture:  
1. Unexpected “events” (such as AEs),  
2. Departure from “well-established use” of the drug that could be transient (eg. catheter 
blocking) or permanent (eg. in the event of dose adjustment (increase) a 7-day follow up should 
be documented).  
Additionally, the ID could be used in the context of AEs reporting to enable  
1. Contextualisation of the use of the drug (i.e. within the “normal conditions of use”),

Target audience and planned distribution path: 
The target audience consists of the caregivers, who will administer NULIBRY to patient in the 
home setting, and patients.  
The infusion diary will be shipped with the drug product, as well as available online for printing.  
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success: 
Effectiveness will be assessed using both process and outcome indicators.  The non-
interventional post authorisation safety study (PASS) will request feedback from treating 
physicians regarding the use of the ID. 
Process indicator: 
The regular use of the ID can be considered as a process indicator and can be documented for 
patients in the non-interventional PASS. 
Outcome indicator: 
The information captured in the ID including medication errors, administration complications, 
and unexpected AEs or AEs of special interest, can be reviewed by the treating physician and 
captured in the non-interventional PASS for an assessment of any intercurrent event.

This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for NULIBRY.  The RMP details 
important risks of NULIBRY, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about NULIBRY's risks and uncertainties (missing information).  
NULIBRY's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how NULIBRY should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for NULIBRY should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
NULIBRY's RMP.  
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
NULIBRY is authorised for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency 
(MoCD) Type A.  It contains fosdenopterin as the active substance and it is given intravenously.  
Further information about the evaluation of NULIBRY’s benefits can be found in NULIBRY’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage <link to the EPAR summary landing page>.  
II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further 
characterize the risks  
Important risks of NULIBRY, together  with measures  to  minimise  such risks and  the proposed 
studies for learning more about NULIBRY's risks, are outlined below.  
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:  
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;  
• Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;  
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;  
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.  
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken, as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of NULIBRY is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.

II.A  List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of NULIBRY are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of NULIBRY.  Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine);

II.B  Summary of important risks 
Important Potential Risk: Medication Errors in the Home Setting 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Treatment with NULIBRY requires specific storage, dosing, and administration, 
which may increase the possibility of medication errors in the home setting.  Most 
patients (90%) in the clinical studies received NULIBRY which was administered 
by a caregiver in the home setting.  Across the 11 patients treated with NULIBRY, 
total exposure was 55.9 patient-years (with median time on treatment, as of the data 
cut-off, of 6.3 years which ranged from 9.0 days to 7.6 years).   No adverse events 
related to dosing were reported throughout the clinical development program (~ 
55.9 patient-years of exposure to NULIBRY treatment).   
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures  
Caregivers will need to be informed on the specific details for storage, dosing, and 
administration. Caregivers must fully understand the way NULIBRY should be 
stored, reconstituted and administered and the dose needed before they commence 
administration of NULIBRY in the home setting. Lack of this information is the 
main risk factor.    
No other particular risk factors or risk groups have been identified. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
•  The dosage and method of administration is described in the SmPC in section 
4.2, storage instructions are provided in section 6.4 and instructions on 
reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, and 
administration and disposal are provided in section 6.6A note in the SmPC 
section 4.2 and 6.6 to caregiver/patient that if deemed appropriate by the HCP 
NULIBRY maybe administered at home by caregiver/patient, they must read 
and follow carefully the detailed instructions for the user provided in the 
carton on the preparation, administration, storage, and disposal of NULIBRY.  
•  A statement in the SmPC section 4.2 and section 6.6 that the HCP should 
calculate and provide the volume of NULIBRY in millilitres (mL) and the 
number of vials needed for each dose to the caregiver/patient.

NULIBRY (fosdenopterin) 9.5 mg powder for solution for injection 
       1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
•  A statement in the PL section 3 stating that NULIBRY can be given at home, 
that before doing this for the first time the doctor or nurse will train the 
patient/caregiver in how to prepare the medicine and give a dose of NULIBRY 
and that the doctor will work out the dose to give.  
• 
Section 5 of the PL contains the storage conditions and instructions not to use 
the medicine if there are any particles or if the solution is discoloured. 
•  The outer carton contains statements to read the package leaflet before use and 
intravenous use after reconstitution and the storage conditions.

•  Warning in SmPC section 4.6 that there is no or limited data from the use of 
fosdenopterin in pregnant women, that animal studies are insufficient with 
respect to reproductive toxicity and that NULIBRY is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  
•  Warning in SmPC section 4.6 that it is unknown whether 
fosdenopterin/metabolites are excreted in human milk, a risk to 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded and a decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue from NULIBRY therapy taking 
into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman.

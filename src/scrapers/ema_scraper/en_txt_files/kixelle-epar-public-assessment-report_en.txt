2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Kixelle (insulin aspart, also referred to in this report as MYL-1601D) is a human insulin analog produced by 
recombinant DNA technology. In EU, MYL-1601D solution for injection was developed as a biological product 
similar to NovoRapid (insulin aspart 100 U/mL), used as the reference product and approved in the EU 
through the centralised procedure on 7 September 1999. NovoRapid is indicated to improve glycaemic control 
in adults and children with diabetes mellitus. The Applicant is seeking approval for the same indication as 
NovoRapid.  
About the product 
MYL-1601D is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Pichia pastoris (yeast). The primary 
structure identical to endogenous insulin, except for replacement of a single proline amino acid at position 28 
in the C-terminal area of the insulin B-chain with an aspartic acid residue. 
MYL-1601D drug product is qualitatively and quantitatively identical to the formulation of reference medicinal 
product NovoRapid with identical excipients and concentrations. MYL-1601D is presented in prefilled pens 
(containing 3 ml equivalent to 300 units), as well as in vials (contains 10 ml equivalent to 1000 units). 1 ml 
solution of MYL-1601D contains 100 units insulin aspart (equivalent to 3.5 mg). 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting. ATC 
code: A10AB05. 
The active substance in MYL-1601D 100 U/mL solution for injection is insulin aspart, a rapid-acting insulin 
analogue, administered subcutaneously by injection in the abdominal wall, the thigh, the upper arm, the 
deltoid region or the gluteal region. The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin aspart is due to the facilitated 
uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous 
inhibition of glucose output from the liver. Insulin Aspart is also used for intravenous administration by 
physicians or other healthcare staff as applicable. Insulin Aspart can be used for continuous subcutaneous 
insulin infusion (CSII) in pump systems. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This Marketing Authorisation Application is an abridged application for a similar biological medicinal product 
under Article 10 (4) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. MYL-1601D has been 
developed as a biosimilar to the reference product NovoRapid (Insulin aspart 100 U/ml). 
The clinical development programme of MYL-1601D has specifically considered the following EU guidelines:  
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 12/90

active substance: Non-clinical and clinical issues Guidance on similar medicinal products containing 
recombinant human soluble Insulin” (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005 Rev.1).  
Based on the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as 
active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1) and Guideline on 
non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human 
insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1), the clinical program was designed to 
confirm the PK, PD, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of MYL-1601D compared with NovoRapid®. The 
clinical development program for this MAA includes the following: 
•  A comparative PK/PD study in NHV, Study MYL-1601D-1001, demonstrated PK and PD equivalence 
between MYL-1601D and NovoRapid® and NovoLog®. 
•  A comparative clinical study in T1DM, Study MYL-1601D-3001 to compare the safety, immunogenicity 
and efficacy of MYL-1601D vs. NovoLog® .  
The development programme is considered in accordance with EMA/CHMP guidelines. 
2.2.  Quality aspects

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The rINN of the active substance is insulin aspart. Insulin aspart is identical in primary structure to human 
insulin, except that it has an aspartic acid instead of proline at position 28 of the B-chain. This change helps 
the fast-acting insulin analog to be absorbed quickly into the bloodstream and helps to lower the blood 
glucose level. The primary and secondary structure of the active substance is in agreement with the structure 
of insulin aspart described in the European monograph for Insulin Aspart. The molecular formula of insulin 
aspart is C256H381N65O79S6 and the relative molecular mass is 5825.6 Da.  
The amino acid sequence of A and B chain in one-letter-code and in three-letter-code with indicated 
disulphide bonds is presented below in Figure 1.

Manufacturing process development 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process developmental information been provided along with 
comparability assessment.  
FMEA methodology was used to assess the criticality of process parameters and control strategy established 
following a risk based approach. Process characterization studies on down-scale models were carried out after 
scale-up to commercial scale manufacturing process. Representativeness of the down-scale model for 
commercial scale has been demonstrated. OFAT or DOE studies were performed to evaluate impact of 
selected potential critical process parameters (pCPPs) on critical quality attributes (CQAs), and a final list of 
CPP and PARs were defined.  
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics 
The active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological state-of-the-art 
methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of insulin aspart.  
The full primary structure, secondary structure and tertiary structure of insulin aspart has been confirmed.  
The protein content (assay) and related substances (deamidated forms and other impurities) were measured 
by RP-HPLCR. Results were well within the Ph. Eur. monograph specifications for Insulin Aspart. The levels of 
the related substances B28 Iso Asp, total deamidated (B3+A21+B3 Iso Asp) and total other impurities in the 
active substance are well within the specification limits given in the Ph. Eur. monograph on Insulin Aspart.  
Another HPLC method is used to separate and accurately quantitate the product variants. The two RP-HPLC 
methods are orthogonal methods, and comparable peak annotations have been shown.  
Functional characterisation (biological activity) and cell-based bioassay (mitogenic and metabolic activity) has 
been performed.  
In summary, the analytical results are consistent with the proposed structure and the characterisation is 
considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
Impurities 
The presence and clearance of each identified product related variant has been analyzed , showing that the 
variants were reduced during the RP-HPLC process steps and that most variants are present either below 
detection or quantification limit (LOD and LOQ) in final AS. In-process controls or controls on the release 
specification with acceptable acceptance limits are in place for these impurities.  
A novel proinsulin impurity due to incomplete cleavage in the respective manufacturing step has been 
identified in the active substance compared to the reference product. The novel impurity has been well 
characterised and shown to not interfere with potency of the active substance. A safety and efficacy 
evaluation of product related impurities in Kixelle finished product has been conducted, including a 
comparison to the impurity levels found in NovoRapid and NovoLog. Further details concerning the level of 
the novel proinsulin impurity is described under “Characterisation of impurities” for finished product (below). 
The levels of deamidated and isomeric variants of insulin aspart (A21Asp, B3Asp, B3IsoAsp and B28IsoAsp) 
found in the active substance are controlled at release with acceptance limits defined by the Ph. Eur. 
monograph for Insulin Aspart. 
The level of HCP, HCDNA and the solvents are controlled on the AS specification.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility, identification, product related 
substances / impurities, related substances, total zinc content, loss on drying, sulfated ash, residual solvents, 
assay, host cell protein, host cell derived DNA, bacterial endotoxins and microbial limits: total aerobic 
microbial count. 
The active substance specification contains the test parameters required by the Ph. Eur. monograph for 
Insulin Aspart and relevant ICH guidelines. The applied acceptance limits for the test parameters are set 
based on clinical data, batch release and shelf-life data, and in accordance with Pharmacopoeial 
requirements.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Ph. Eur. methods are used for appearance, identity by peptide 
mapping, loss on drying, sulphated ash and endotoxin. The USP method is used for total aerobic microbial 
count. Detailed description of the following methods were presented: solubility, host cell DNA detection, HCP 
detection , residual solvent, Assay Content for related substances, SCP, HMW species. Equivalence between 
the Ph. Eur. methods described in the monograph for Insulin Aspart and the In-house methods have been 
demonstrated.  
Reference standards 
No in-house primary reference standard has been established since official pharmacopeia standards are 
available for Insulin Aspart. In-house Working reference standards are also been established. Qualification of 
the working standard is considered adequate. An appropriate qualification protocol for future in-house 
reference standards has been provided. 
Batch analysis 
The batch results are within the proposed specification limits, and the results confirm consistency and 
uniformity of the active substance, indicating that the manufacturing process is under control.  
Container closure 
Sufficient detailed information on the container closure system of the AS is provided and has been shown to 
be appropriate. 
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf-life 
of 36 months when stored in the proposed container at -20°C and protected from light.  
Stability studies under long term (-20°C ± 5°C), accelerated (5°C ± 3°C), stressed (25°C ± 2ºC/60±5% RH) 
and forced degradation (temperature stress and photo stability) conditions have been performed according to 
the ICH guidelines. 
The stability studies were conducted in accordance with ICH Q5C, Stability testing of 
Biotechnological/Biological Products.  
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021

All stability data remained within defined acceptance criteria at long-term, accelerated and stressed 
conditions, indicating a very stable active substance.  
The photo stability study followed the ICH guideline Q1B and showed that the active substance is sensitive to 
light degradation.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product (Kixelle) is a sterile, aqueous, clear and colourless solution containing 100 units/mL of 
insulin aspart. 
The product is available in 10 mL vials and in a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 mL glass cartridges and 
as follows: 
•  10 ml solution in vial (type 1 glass) closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium flip-off 
seal. Pack sizes of 1, or 5 vials or a multipack containing 5 (5 packs of 1) vials.  
•  3 ml solution in cartridge (type 1 glass) with a plunger and stopper (bromobutyl) and aluminium seal 
contained in a multidose pre-filled pen. Pack sizes of 1, 5, 10 pre-filled pens, or a multipack 
containing 10 (2 packs of 5) pre-filled pens. 
The packaging material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The excipients include the 
preservative m-cresol and phenol, glycerol and sodium chloride as tonicity agents and zinc chloride as 
stabilizer in water for injection. All the excipients are of Ph. Eur. grade.  
Pharmaceutical development  
In general, the development of the finished product (FP) manufacturing process is found appropriate. The 
finished product formulation composition was based on reference product EU-Approved NovoRapid 
composition. Product development activities included identification of critical excipients and parameters which 
could impact the product quality and stability. The formulation, optimized during the formulation 
development, has been used in non-clinical studies and clinical testing and for the intended commercial 
process. 
Post process characterisation studies, material attribute and process parameters were identified as Critical 
Process Parameter (CPP) and Non-Critical Process Parameter (NCPP). As a result of these studies, PAR and 
NOR were identified for CPPs and non-CPPs during routine manufacturing of finished product.  
The finished product contains the two preservatives m-cresol and phenol, and the antimicrobial effectiveness 
by the end of in-use stability studies has been demonstrated compliant with Ph. Eur. 5.1.3.  
The vial and cartridge primary container closure systems are tested for compatibility with the finished 
product. For vials, the glass and rubber stopper are in direct contact with FP, and for cartridges the glass 
cartridge, rubber plunger stopper and lined seals are in contact with FP. Extraction studies were individually 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 18/90 
 
  
  
performed with the single container closure components detecting which organic compounds and inorganic 
substances that may migrate into the FP formulation. The screening leachable studies confirmed product 
compatibility with the container closure systems. The container closure integrity of both vials and cartridges 
is controlled in the FP specifications and tested during stability studies using leak test as per Ph. Eur. 3.2.9. 
Product compatibility and in-use stability with insulin infusion pump, infusion fluid and bag, as well as insulin 
syringe has been sufficiently demonstrated.  
Medical Device 
The pen was designed and developed by considering the relevant ISO standards.  
Acceptable specifications for the pen body sub-assembly are presented. The functionality of the device is 
confirmed in accordance with appropriate regulatory guidance’s and ISO standards. A selection of 
commercially available needles was applied in these studies and confirmed to comply with the requirements. 
These needles are also indicated in the Instructions for use (SmPC section 6.6) as suitable for Kixelle pen 
injector. A usability study confirmed that the Kixelle pen, when used in accordance with the Instructions for 
Use, could be used safely and effectively by the intended user population.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is filled in 3 mL cartridges and 10 mL vials. The cartridges are further assembled with 
the pen components to Kixelle disposable pen injector. A valid QP declaration and valid GMP certificates are 
available. 
The finished product manufacturing process has been adequately described. Main steps are dissolution of AS 
(solution 1), preparation of excipient solution (solution 2), mixing of solution 1 & 2, pre-filtration, sterile 
filtration, filling and sealing.  
2Process performance qualification/process validation was conducted by manufacturing sufficient number 
commercial scale cartridge and vial validation batches at the commercial manufacturing site. The FP 
manufacturing process, starting with a single AS batch or pooling of AS batches, is considered validated.  
The pen assembly process involves assembling of the FP filled cartridges with the pen components. in-
process checks after each step of the assembly process assure the correct assembly of the disposable pens. 
For the pre-filled pens, functional performance test results confirmed appropriate device functionality.  
The filter validation studies are found sufficient.  
The aseptic filling process has been validated in accordance with Ph. Eur. 2.6.1.  
Shipping container qualification has been conducted and found acceptable. Both pens and vials will be release 
to the European marked after passing the release testing.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product specification (vial) includes tests for description, pH of solution, visible particles, 
subvisible particles, extractable volume, identification, product related proteins/impurities, assay, zinc, m-
cresol content, phenol content, seal integrity, bacterial endotoxins, sterility. The finished product specification 
(3 ml cartridge) includes tests for description, pH of solution, visible particles, subvisible particles, extractable 
Assessment report

volume, identification, product related proteins/impurities, assay, zinc, m-cresol content, phenol content, seal 
integrity, bacterial endotoxins, sterility, dimensions of cartridge, friction force test. The finished product 
specification for pre-filled pen (integrated with 3 mL cartridge) includes tests for description, cosmetic test, 
functional test. The battery of tests listed on the FP specifications is acceptable and in line with ICH Q6B. 
A justification of the specifications, including test parameters, analytical methods and acceptance criteria, has 
been provided. The parameters for controlling the quality of the finished product are derived by taking 
pharmacopeia monographs, ICH Q6B and the release and real time stability data into consideration. 
Analytical methods  
The analytical methods have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Characterisation of impurities 
The potential impurities in the FP are stated to be the same as those described for AS. As discussed above, a 
novel proinsulin impurity is detected in the active substance compared to the reference product. This novel 
impurity is being monitored and controlled during downstream process of the AS manufacturing process. 
Being a process related impurity, arising during the AS manufacturing, it does not increase during the FP 
manufacturing nor upon storage. Complete characterization data has been provided. 
A risk assessment on elemental impurities has been provided. The risk assessment was performed in 
accordance with ICH Q3D.  
Additionally, a risk evaluation concerning the potential risk of nitrosamines in the AS and FP manufacturing 
process has been provided. The risk evaluation has been performed in accordance with EMA guidance. There 
were no risks identified, and it can therefore be concluded that there is no possibility of nitrosamine 
impurities being present in either AS or FP. Confirmatory testing for presence of nitrosamine impurities in AS 
and FP is therefore considered to be unnecessary. 
Reference standards 
The reference standards for MYL-1601D finished product are the same as those used for active substance. No 
other product specific reference standards are used in the testing of the finished product.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the vial presentation, of the cartridge and PFP presentation were provided. The batch 
results are all well within specification limits, and the results confirm consistency and uniformity of the 
product, indicating that the manufacturing process is under control.   
Container closure 
The finished product is filled aseptically into vials or cartridges. The 3 ml Type-I clear colourless glass 
cartridges are plugged with sterilized bromobutyl plunger stoppers and sealed with aluminium lined seals. 
Each 3 mL cartridge is integrated into a Pre-filled Pen. The PFP complies with the requirements of ISO 11608-
1.  
The quality of the PFP components (pen body subassembly, cartridge holder and pen cap) are appropriately 
controlled. The packaging components for the single entity product consist of the printed carton, Patient 
Instruction Leaflet and Instructions for Use. 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 20/90 
 
  
  
 
The 10 ml glass vials comply with the requirements of the USP monographs for Type-I glass containers. The 
rubber stoppers comply with the requirements for Type I closures specified in USP <381> and Ph. Eur. 3.2.9. 
The specifications have been developed to provide assurance of the suitability of the packaging material. The 
glass vials closed with rubber stoppers are sealed using 13 mm, round flip-off seals with aluminium and 
plastic parts attached to each other.  
Stability of the product 
The stability results indicate that the finished product is sufficiently stable. Based on available stability data, 
the proposed shelf-life for Kixelle (vials and pens) of 30 months when stored at 5°C±3°C as stated in the 
SmPC are acceptable.  
All test parameters complied with their acceptance criteria when Kixelle was stored in vials and cartridges at 
the recommended storage condition (5°C±3°C) for up to 30 months.  
Sustained functionality of the pen device during storage has been demonstrated and the provided 
functionality stability data is considered sufficient to support the proposed shelf life.  
In-use stability data in cartridges assembled with pens and in vials were provided. The test results confirmed 
adequate physicochemical and microbiological quality during use. Based on the results from the in-use 
stability study, the in-use storage conditions recommended for cartridges integrated in a PFP after first 
opening are: 28 days (4 weeks) below 30°C once opened, can be stored in refrigerator (2-8°C), do not 
freeze.  
Based on the results from the in-use stability study, the in-use storage conditions recommended for vials 
after first opening are: 28 days (4 weeks) below 30°C once opened, do not refrigerate, do not freeze. A 
comparative forced degradation study was performed with the FP and NovoRapid. The degradation pathway 
and rate of degradation is found to be comparable for all parameters confirming comparable stability.  
Post approval change management protocol  
The Applicant applies for a PACMP regarding recycling of solvent.  
Adventitious agents 
No material of animal origin is used in the routine manufacture of Kixelle. This applies to the active substance 
and all excipients used for the manufacture of the above mentioned finished product. 
An adequate control strategy is in place during manufacturing to control possible contamination of the active 
substance and finished product. 
The adventitious agents safety evaluation is considered acceptable.

Biosimilarity  
An extensive biosimilar exercise was conducted to demonstrate analytical similarity of Kixelle to the EU-
approved reference product NovoRapid. Additionally, analytical bridging has been performed to compare 
Kixelle, EU NovoRapid reference product and US NovoLog comparator.  
Results from side-by-side analysis of Kixelle and the reference products as well as stand-alone analyses 
conducted at different times were presented.  
Risk ranking of quality attributes 
For the biosimilarity study, quality attributes of insulin aspart that may have impact on safety and/or efficacy 
were classified. Product variants such as size variants, precursors and flanked variants, charge variants, and 
truncated forms, and structural and functional attributes comprising protein concentration, primary and 
higher order structures, biological activity (determined as metabolic and mitogenic activity) and zinc content, 
were evaluated for analytical similarity between the biosimilar and the reference product. The quality 
attributes are ranked and categorised for their criticality applying risk assessment principles and tools in 
accordance with ICH Q8 and ICH Q9, which is considered appropriate.  
Statistical approach 
For those quality attributes where a descriptive statistical approach was applicable (e.g. protein content, 
deamidation and biological activity), evaluation of the biosimilarity has been made against a pre-defined 
quality range. 
For those quality attributes where a statistical approach was not feasible or appropriate (e.g. higher order 
structure measured by X-ray crystallography or NMR), similarity assessment was based on a qualitative 
comparison of the analytical data/profiles, which is acceptable. 
Analytical methods for demonstrating biosimilarity 
Structural biosimilarity between Kixelle test product and NovoRapid reference product and the comparator 
NovoLog was studied by applying numerous state-of-the-art methods. Intact and reduced mass 
determination by HPLC/ESI-MS, reduced and non-reduced peptide mass fingerprinting, Far and Near UV-CD, 
FT-IR, 2D NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy (intrinsic and extrinsic), differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic 
light scattering, X-Ray crystallography and NMR demonstrate similarity in terms of primary (i.e., amino acid 
sequence), secondary, tertiary structure and molecular mass. Likewise, protein content and pI of the Kixelle 
test product was shown to fall into the quality range of NovoRapid reference product and to be comparable 
between NovoRapid and the comparator NovoLog. 
A novel proinsulin impurity was detected in Kixelle. This impurity cannot be found in the reference product. 
No change in potency of Kixelle was observed confirming efficacy-issues of this novel impurity at enriched 
levels. 
The applied analytical panel for comparison of size variants and product impurities/variants of Kixelle active 
substance is considered sufficient.  
Biological activity in terms of in vitro metabolic and in vitro mitogenic activity was investigated. Binding to 
the IR-A, IR-B and IGF-1R receptor were evaluated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) techniques and the 
ability of the multiple product batches to auto-phosphorylate the IR-A and IR-B receptors was measured. For 
metabolic endpoints, various assays measuring Adipogenesis, Inhibition of Stimulated lipolysis as well as 
Glucose consumption assays were performed. The results of the similarity studies concerning the biological

The HMWP values in 
large number of MYL-
1601D batches are 
outside the quality 
range. This is 
attributed to the 
relatively young age of 
these batches in 
comparison to the age 
of the EU approved 
Novorapid and US 
licensed NovoLog. In 
MYL-1601D batches at 
24 months age, the 
HMWP values fall 
within the quality 
ranges. Hence, MYL-

It is noted that the 
values of two Kixelle 
batches fall below the 
lower limit of the 
quality range of 
NovoRapid. The 
marginally lower zinc 
content in the two 
batches has however 
been evaluated to not 
have an impact on 
their structure or 
function, and the 
difference in Zinc 
content observed for 
the two Kixelle batches 
does not pose any 
residual uncertainty for 
analytical similarity 
when compared to 
NovoRapid.  
The levels of Des B30 
in NovoRapid are 
below the quantitation 
limit of the method 
and hence no 
quantitative 
comparison was 
performed. The levels 
of this species seen in 
MYL-1601D batches 
does not pose a risk to 
patient safety and 
efficacy, as this is a 
common metabolite of 
insulin found in 
humans.  
100% of MYL-1601D 
batches are within the 
quality range of EU-
approved NovoRapid.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The initial major objection related to the suitability of the test methods 
used for assay and detection of impurities were satisfactorily resolved by the applicant providing additional 
data. A PACMP to introduce recycling of solvent (used in the purification steps in downstream to minimise 
waste was considered acceptable. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
Biosimilarity between Kixelle and the reference product NovoRapid/NovoLog has been demonstrated.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Mylan’s Insulin Aspart, MYL-1601D, is submitted as a 
biosimilar to EU-approved NovoRapid®. EU guideline on biosimilar products are proposing a step-wise process 
to support the non-clinical aspects of the MAA, where in vitro pharmacology studies are vital to show 
biosimilarity, and in vivo animal studies should only be performed if needed (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/ 
42832/2005 Rev1). The non-clinical studies conducted should be comparative in nature and designed to have 
appropriate sensitivity to detect relevant differences in the response to the similar biological medicinal 
product and the reference medicinal product and should not just assess the response per se 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/ 32775/2005 Rev. 1, 2015).  
In the course of development, the Applicant has completed the following nonclinical studies with MYL-1601D 
drug product: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Insulin Receptor-A Binding Kinetics assay 
Insulin Receptor-B Binding Kinetics assay 
IGF-1R Binding Kinetics assay 
Insulin Receptor –A Phosphorylation assay 
Insulin Receptor –B Phosphorylation assay 
•  Cell based bioassay for mitogenic activity 
•  Cell based bioassay for metabolic activity (glucose uptake) 
•  Cell based bioassay for metabolic activity (inhibition of stimulated lipolysis) 
•  Cell based bioassay for metabolic activity (adipogenesis) 
•  Rabbit Potency Assays, USP <121> 
•  Acute Toxicology (single-dose) 
•  Repeat Dose Toxicology and Toxicokinetics (28-Day) 
All the in vitro pharmacodynamic assays supporting MYL-1601D similarity to NovoRapid (EU approved) and 
NovoLog (US approved) are conducted in accordance to GLP. 
Two non-clinical in vivo toxicity studies are included in the dossier, a single dose study in rats and a 28-day 
repeat dose study in rats. The toxicity studies are conducted in two facilities in India and both study reports 
contain GLP statements from the Indian authorities. However, the test facilities were not a part of an EU or 
OECD Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) accepted GLP monitoring program in the period the studies were 
conducted. Hence, the two non-clinical toxicity studies are not considered to be OECD GLP compliant studies. 
This is acceptable since in vivo toxicity studies are not pivotal for biosimilar applications according to EMA 
guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/ 32775/2005_Rev.1).

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The Applicant has followed the recommendations of the Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of 
similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1) regarding in vitro non-clinical pharmacological similarity studies. 
The guideline recommends comparative insulin receptor binding studies, the measurement of kinetic 
constants, direct receptor stimulation capability determination by measuring autophosphorylation, three 
metabolic activity studies and, if deemed necessary, measurement of mitogenic activity. The Applicant has 
performed all the required studies and the mean, standard deviation and comparability range of the tested 
batches of the EU reference NovoRapid, NovoLog and MYL-1601D was presented in table 3.2.1.1 below. 
Additionally, the in vitro studies are briefly summarized in the following section.

IR-A and IR-B binding studies  
Binding studies using Biacore surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technic was performed with the objective of 
quantify and compare binding kinetics of MYL-1601D, NovoRapid®, and NovoLog® to either insulin receptor.  
IR-A and IR-B binding studies was conducted for sufficient number of batches of MYL-1601D drug product, 
MYL-1601D drug substance, NovoRapid® and NovoLog®, including determination of on-off kinetics, by 
assessment of rate of association (ka), rate of dissociation (kd), and dissociation constant (KD). 
IR-A and IR-B binding studies was conducted for sufficient number of batches of MYL-1601D drug product, 
MYL-1601D drug substance, NovoRapid® and NovoLog®, including determination of on-off kinetics, by 
assessment of rate of association (ka), rate of dissociation (kd), and dissociation constant (KD).  
Mean values of triplicate measures were presented as mean ± standard deviation in table 3.2.1.2 below  
Table 3.2.1.2: Kinetic binding of NovoRapid, MYL-1601D and NovoLog to IR-A and IR-B (Table 26 and 27, 
similar to the updated table 1 and 2 from the pharmacology written summary). 
For the purpose of comparability assessment, quality range approach was applied where the quality ranges 
were determined based upon the Mean ± 3SD (standard deviation) of all analysed NovoRapid® batches. 
Then, MYL-1601D was compared against the range established by NovoRapid®. 
Comparability was considered demonstrated if more than 90% of the MYL-1601D batches fell within the lower 
and upper limit of NovoRapid® batches (Mean±3SD). In table 3.2.1.3 below, data from the comparability 
assessment of the IR-A and IR-B binding kinetic studies are presented.

IR-A and IR-B phosphorylation studies 
Phosphorylation of the receptors by insulin aspart were evaluated in CHO-K1 cells overexpressing IR-A and 
IR-B using AlphaScreen Surefire technology. 
Sufficient number of batches of MYL-1601D drug product, NovoRapid® and NovoLog® were tested in assays 
for both IR-B and IR-A phosphorylation with the objective to quantify and compare the capacity of MYL-
1601D, NovoRapid®, and NovoLog® to generate autophosphorylation.  
Relative potencies were calculated by comparison to the Internal working reference standards (IWRS) and 
presented as mean±SD. Results are presented in Table 3.2.1.4 below.

Table 3.2.1.4: Relative potency of phosphorylation of insulin receptor A and B in response to MYL-1601D, 
NovoRapid and NovoLog (Table 3 and 4 from the pharmacology written summary). 
Applicant concluded that the results indicates that MYL-1601D’s capacity to phosphorylate insulin receptor B 
and A is comparable to that of NovoRapid® and NovoLog®.  
Studies on metabolic activity  
Three different assays on metabolic activity were conducted in accordance with the guidelines 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/ 32775/2005_Rev.1), measuring glucose uptake/consumption, inhibition of stimulated 
lipolysis and lipogenesis respectively. The choice of studies is supported.  
•  Glucose consumption assay 
Sufficient number of batches of MYL-1601D drug product, MYL-1601D drug substance, NovoRapid®, and 
NovoLog® were used for testing glucose uptake response. Samples was compared to the IWRS. Results are 
presented in table 3.2.1.5 below.

• 
Inhibition of Stimulated Lipolysis 
Sufficient number of batches of MYL-1601D drug product, NovoRapid® and NovoLog® were compared in this 
assay for inhibition of stimulated lipolysis in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Samples was compared to the IWRS. 
Results are presented in table 3.2.1.6 below.  
Table 3.2.1.6: Inhibition of stimulated lipolysis (table 7 from the pharmacology written summary). 
•  Adipogenesis study 
Sufficient number of batches of MYL-1601D drug product, NovoRapid® and NovoLog® were compared in this 
assay with the objective of assessing adipogenesis. The outcome of the sample analysis was expressed in 
terms of "Mean Percent Relative Potency" by comparing the sample to the IWRS. The percent relative 
potency of "Reference Standard" was presumed to be 100%.  
Results are presented in table 3.2.1.7 below. 
Table 3.2.1.7: Adipogenesis (table 6 from the pharmacology written summary). 
In vivo rabbit blood sugar potency study 
The rabbit potency study was conducted in consideration of the USP <121> monograph guidelines, as an FDA 
requirement. However, this is not in accordance to EMA guidelines as “comparative in vivo studies of 
pharmacodynamic effects would not be anticipated to be sensitive enough to detect differences not identified 
by in vitro assays, and are not required as part of the comparability exercise” (EMEA/CHMP/ 
BMWP/32775/2005_Rev.1).  
Required number of batches of MYL-1601D DS has been tested. As reference standard USP Insulin Aspart RS 
lot F0L097 was used (USP certificate is included in Annexure 4 of the study reports). Results are presented in 
table 3.2.1.8 below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 31/90 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Table 3.2.1.8: Rabbit potency assay (table 7 from the non-clinical overview). 
The data from the rabbit blood sugar potency test has been assessed and the study has been conducted 
properly. However, the results of the rabbit study are considered as supplementary since in vivo studies are 
not sensitive enough for biosimilar testing and therefore not necessary according to guideline. The 
insensitivity of the study was even more pronounced by the fact that neither of the insulin aspart doses 
caused symptomatic hypoglycaemia in the fasted animals, nor was any differences seen in the blood glucose 
lowering potencies of the test and reference insulin aspart preparations. 
Studies on mitogenic activity 
According to guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/ 2005_Rev.1) an assay on comparative IGF-1 receptor 
binding and functional activity can be included to cover this potential toxicological effect. In the current MAA 
the applicant has included an IGF-1 receptor binding assay in addition to a mitogenic activity assay 
conducted in Saos2 cells.  
Sufficient number of batches of MYL-1601D drug product, MYL-1601D drug substance, NovoRapid® and 
NovoLog® were assessed in these assays. Results are presented in table 3.2.1.9 below. 
Table 3.2.1.9: Kinetic binding and mitogenic potency of MYL-1601D, NovoRapid and NovoLog to IGF-1R 
(table 9 and 10 from the pharmacology written summary). 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 32/90 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The rationale for carrying out these studies was that signalling through IGF-1R can potentiate growth and 
proliferation of cancer cell lines. This argumentation and the conduct of the studies are endorsed. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies regarding Secondary Pharmacodynamics were performed. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
No studies regarding Safety Pharmacology were performed. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
According to the guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins 
as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1) studies regarding 
safety pharmacology, reproduction toxicology, and carcinogenicity are not required for non-clinical testing of 
biosimilars. 
No pharmacodynamic interactions was expected as insulins are very specific hormones and no other drugs act 
on insulin receptors. The lack of pharmacodynamic interaction studies is accepted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No dedicated non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in support of the current MAA for MYL-
1601D. This is acceptable, as the product is intended as a biosimilar medicinal product with NovoRapid as the 
EU reference product. No nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies should be performed according to guidelines. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Two rat toxicity studies, a single dose acute toxicity study and a 28-day repeat dose toxicity study, was 
included in this biosimilar application. In both studies the US licensed NovoLog was used as reference 
product, not the EU approved NovoRapid.  
Single dose toxicity 
An iv single dose acute toxicity study in rats (Study U-16366) comparing MYL-1601D to the US-approved 
NovoLog was performed. No evidence of systemic toxicity was seen in the single dose toxicity study of doses 
approximately 20-, 40-, and 80-fold the intended therapeutic starting dose in humans.  
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 33/90 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Maximum tolerated dose in the rats were determined to be the highest tested dose of 17.5 mg/kg (500 U/kg) 
for both of MYL-1601D and NovoLog. The only consistent observation was symptoms of hypoglycaemia, 
which is an expected exaggerated pharmacology effect, following administration of insulin to normo-
glycaemic animals. No reversible, persistent or delayed toxic effects was registered during the 14-day post 
injection observation period.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
A 28-day repeat-dose toxicity study in rats (Study U-16377) comparing subcutaneous injections of MYL-
1601D to the US-approved NovoLog was performed. A 14-day recovery group and a toxicokinetic/pharmaco-
dynamic group were included in the study and treated with similar doses as the main toxicity group. No 
evidence of systemic toxicity was seen in the repeat-dose toxicity study in rats with daily doses of 0.21, 0.63, 
or 2.1 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 1-, 3-, or 10-fold the intended starting therapeutic dose in humans (1 
U/kg/day; 0.035 mg/kg/day). A NOAEL>2.1 mg/kg/day was established for both MYL-1601D and NovoLog®.  
An indication of comparable pharmacodynamic and toxicokinetic effects was seen for MYL-1601D and 
NovoLog. Both drugs induced a reduction in blood glucose within the same interval (36-50 mg/dl) and no 
dose proportional increase in pharmacodynamic response were observed for either drug. Comparable drug 
exposure was seen for MYL-1601D and NovoLog and no signs of accumulation between day 1 and 28 were 
observed. A small difference was seen in when Tmax is obtained (at 0,5 or 6,5 h). However, as two separate 
serum insulin peaks are seen for both drug items, it can only be concluded that Tmax is obtained 
approximately 30 min after injection for both types of Insulin Aspart. An indication of a more than dose 
proportional increase in systemic insulin exposure and peak serum concentrations was observed on both day 
1 and 28. No obvious differences were seen across sexes.  
Like in the acute toxicology study, the repeat dose study also demonstrated consistent observations of 
hypoglycemia in both MYL-1601D and NovoLog® treated rats. Hypoglycemia is an anticipated 
pharmacological effect and was not considered adverse for the purpose of these toxicology studies.  
In the repeat-dose toxicity study evidence of local reactions at the injection sites was detected as hyperaemia 
in the subcutis corresponding histologically to haemorrhage and cell infiltration with primarily mononuclear 
cell and occasionally neutrophil granulocytes. However, similar changes were seen in all treatment groups, 
including placebo treated animals. The lesions were reversible and not detected in the recovery group at day 
43. It is therefore agreed, that the lesions are related to repletely induced injection trauma and independent 
of test or reference drugs injected.  
Local tolerance endpoints were therefore successfully included in the repeat dose toxicity study performed. 
Since no new excipients have been included, no stand-alone non-clinical local tolerance study is required 
according to the relevant guidelines for similar biological pharmaceuticals (CHMP/437/ 04 Rev 1; 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP42832/2005/Rev 1; and EMEA/CHMP/BWMP/322775/2005 Rev 1).   
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were performed with Myl-1601D.

Carcinogenicity 
No carcinotoxicity studies were performed with Myl-1601D. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproduction toxicity studies were performed with Myl-1601D. 
Local Tolerance  
In the repeat-dose toxicity study evidence of local reactions at the injection sites was detected as hyperaemia 
in the subcutis corresponding histologically to haemorrhage and cell infiltration with primarily mononuclear 
cell and occasionally neutrophil granulocytes. However, similar changes were seen in all treatment groups, 
including placebo treated animals. The lesions were reversible and not detected in the recovery group at day 
43. It is therefore agreed, that the lesions are related to repletely induced injection trauma and independent 
of test or reference drugs injected.  
Local tolerance endpoints were therefore successfully included in the repeat dose toxicity study performed. 
Since no new excipients have been included, no stand-alone non-clinical local tolerance study is required 
according to the relevant guidelines for similar biological pharmaceuticals (CHMP/437/ 04 Rev 1; 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP42832/2005/Rev 1; and EMEA/CHMP/BWMP/322775/2005 Rev 1).   
Other toxicity studies 
A novel proinsulin impurity due to incomplete enzymatic cleavage has been identified in MYL-1601D DS. The 
efficacy of the novel impurity has been sufficiently discussed in the quality part of the MAA and it is shown to 
not interfere with potency of MYL-1601D. A summary of the discussion of the metabolism and safety of this 
impurity and its precursors are provided as follows.  
Metabolism of the Proinsulin Aspart Impurity 
The similarity of the insulin aspart impurity sequence to sequences from endogenous human proteins was 
provided by the applicant. The similarity in sequences indicated that this peptide will be 
metabolized/eliminated in a comparable manner with the insulin aspart. Therefore, it was concluded that 
considering the presumed capability of the endogenous proteases to digest the insulin aspart impurity, the 
rapid digestion of native insulin by these enzymes, and the short half-life of proteins with similar sequences 
as the proinsulin impurity in the body, any administered such impurity is expected to be rapidly degraded 
with no accumulation.  
Metabolism of Insulin aspart precursors 
Even though enzymatic processing potentially could generate multiple impurities resulting from alternative 
trypsin cleavage sites, only the SCP (single chain precursor) and the proinsulin impurity are detected in MYL-
1601D DS or DP. The release from subcutaneous compartment, the half-life and the degradation by 
endogenous enzymes of SCP is expected to be similar to that of proinsulin. The non-native sequence 
components  is expected to be digested by endogenous catabolic processes as presented above. 
Safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 35/90 
 
  
  
The safety of the proinsulin impurity and SCP was supported by the repeat dose toxicology study U-16377 in 
rats. In this study, the rats receiving the highest dose were exposed to at least 3-4 times the expected 
clinical dose of the impurities without showing evidence of toxic events. The NOAEL of the study was actually 
set to the highest dose of 2.1 mg/kg/day, which additionally substantiates the safety of the impurities. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Insulin aspart, MYL-1601D, is a peptide, and peptides are exempted from performing any ERA studies, as 
they are considered to be a natural substance, and to rapidly biodegrade, and hence not pose any risk to the 
environment.  
Furthermore, insulin aspart is already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in 
environmental exposure is anticipated following marketing of Applicants product. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology  
A sufficient number of in vitro pharmacology studies have been performed in order to assess receptor 
binding, receptor phosphorylation and metabolic activity for MYL-1601D insulin aspart and NovoRapid (and 
NovoLog), in accordance to the relevant guideline (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/ 32775/2005 Rev. 1, 2015). The 
methods used in the in vitro pharmacology studies are acceptable and sensitive enough to detect difference 
between the test and the reference compounds. The number of tested batches and the number of 
runs/replicates are sufficient. The batch used in the clinical study MYL-1601D-1001 was tested in all in vitro 
studies.  
Minimum and maximum potency values of MYL-161D were within the lower and upper limit for the EU 
reference NovoRapid (and NovoLog), as presented by the applicant in table 3.2.1.1. The only exception was 
the upper limit of the inhibition of stimulated lipolysis which diverged slightly compared to the upper limit of 
NovoRapid. Overall, this was considered sufficient to confirm biosimilarity from a non-clinical point of view. It 
should, nevertheless, be noted that the relative potencies of the compounds were calculated toward an 
internal working reference standard (IWRS) instead of providing the actual data with their standard errors. 
The “Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing 
recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues” (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/ 32775/2005_Rev. 1) states: 
“Biosimilar and reference product should be compared head-to-head in the same experiment.” Using an 
internal standard makes the comparison between MYL1601D and NovoRapid® indirect. The rationale given to 
explain the use of internal standards were acceptable from a quality point of view as batch consistency is a 
critical quality issue. However, in non-clinical pharmacology the test and reference batches used in the 
studies must be compared with each other. In the clinical studies, no internal reference standard is used, the 
test compound and the EU reference are compared directly and non-clinical in vitro pharmacology studies 
should follow the same approach. Given that in vitro studies are generally more sensitive than clinical trials 
direct comparisons can reveal differences better. If the test and reference compounds give the same results 
(meaning there is no significant differences between the final parameters of each in vitro study) the test 
compound is biosimilar to the reference from a non-clinical pharmacology point of view.  
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 36/90 
 
  
  
 
However, EC50/IC50 values of the functional in vitro pharmacology studies were provided and showed visual 
overlap of EC50 values of MYL-1601D, NovoRapid, NovoLog and IWRS in the different assays. Additionally, 
individual concentration-effect curves of each biological activity assay, all showed the classic sigmoid shape 
and the test compound curve overlapped with that of the IRWS. Furthermore, the two IWRS, i.e. 
BS16003812 and BS17008947, have been sufficiently characterized in order to assess comparability between 
MYL-1601D, NovoRapid® and NovoLog®. Therefore, the totality of the data provided was considered sufficient 
to support non-clinical biosimilarity and the issue of the lacking head-to-head comparison will not be further 
pursued. 
Toxicology 
Two rat toxicity studies, a single dose acute toxicity study and a 28-day repeat dose study, were included in 
this biosimilar marketing authorisation application. 
Generally, in vivo studies are considered not to be sufficiently sensitive to conclude on biosimilarity. 
Consequently, in vivo toxicity studies are not a requirement according to EMA guidelines and hence the 
animal studies are unnecessary from a 3R perspective (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005 _Rev.1). In vivo 
studies should only be conducted if uncertainties of safety issues remain after the step-wise approach based 
on the result of extensive structural and functional characterization (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1). 
Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the US-approved NovoLog has been used as reference product in 
the toxicity studies instead of the EU-approved NovoRapid. 
The two toxicity studies are only used for guidance on maximum tolerated doses (MTD) and indications of 
comparable reaction pattern between MYL-1601D and NovoLog/NovoRapid. In conclusion, the studies are 
considered to be of supplementary character and not pivotal for approval, since they are not sufficiently 
sensitive for biosimilar assessment, as specified in the relevant guidelines and previously highlighted.  
Other toxicity studies 
A novel proinsulin aspart impurity, was identified in Kixelle but not in the reference product. The impact of 
this impurity on efficacy was addressed in the quality part of the assessment. A sufficient discussion of the 
metabolism of this impurity and insulin aspart precursors and relevant literature was presented in the non-
clinical material. Furthermore, the safety of this impurity and the single chain precursor was supported by the 
repeat dose toxicology study U-16377, where the rats received 3-4 times the amount of the impurities as 
expected in the human clinical setting. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Providing evidence of pharmacological similarity between the product under review and the reference product 
is the main objective of a biosimilar application. In the current MAA, non-clinical biosimilarity has been 
confirmed between MYL-1601D and the EU reference NovoRapid (and NovoLog) based on in vitro studies for 
receptor binding and metabolic activity in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
SmPC wording in section 4.6 and 5.3 is identical to the reference product SmPC and therefore acceptable.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study design 
Study MYL-1601D-1001 was a randomised, double-blind, three-treatment, three-period, crossover, 12-hour 
euglycemic glucose clamp study that was conducted in order to demonstrate biosimilarity between MYL-
1601D and NovoRapid (EU-approved) and NovoLog (US-licensed), respectively. A single dose of 0.2 U/kg was 
used, and the blood glucose concentrations were clamped at 81mg/dl (4.5 mmol/l). Several blood samples 
were collected during the clamp. There were 12-16 days between the clamp visits.  
Plasma insulin aspart concentration profiles were used to calculate the PK parameters.

Three separate analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were conducted – excluding the data from the 
treatment that was not part of the comparison. The primary PK endpoints, derived from plasma insulin aspart 
concentrations profiles, were analyzed using logarithm-transformed data. The ANOVA was based on a general 
linear model (proc GLM) using clinical site, treatment, sequence, period, clinical site by sequence, clinical site 
by treatment, and subject within (clinical site by sequence) as fixed effects. Clinical site by treatment 
interaction was dropped from the analysis since not found to be significant. Data was logarithmically 
transformed and the 90% CI for the endpoints were calculated and evaluated according to the 80%-125% 
pre-specified limits. The per protocol population was used for PK analysis. 
The study population consisted of healthy men and women. 72 subjects were randomised. One subject 
withdrew before first dose, and three subjects withdrew their consent during the study. Two subjects did not 
meet the required time window in terms of scheduling the visits. 70 subjects were exposed to MYL-1601D, 69 
to Novolog and 67 to NovoRapid. Consequently, the per protocol populations for the MYL-1601D vs. NovoLog 
and MYL-1601D vs. NovoRapid comparisons consist of 68 and 67 subjects, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
For the primary endpoints, AUC(0-12h) and Cmax, the 90% confidence intervals were within the predefined limits 
(80% and 125%) for the comparison with NovoLog as well as NovoRapid (Figure 2 and Table 3). 
For one of the secondary endpoints, AUC(6-12h) the ratio between MYL-1601D and NovoLog was 75.60 (61.38; 
92.16), and the ratio between MYL-1601D and NovoRapid was 81.37 (62.70; 105.75) and outside the 
predefined limits of biosimilarity. 
The mean T½ for MYL-1601D, NovoRapid and NovoLog were 0.88 h, 0.89 h and 0.93 h, respectively, and are 
considered similar.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
MYL-1601D is a rapid-acting human insulin analogue formulated as a solution for injection available in multi-
dose vials and pre-filled pens. 
The active substance in MYL-1601D 100 U/mL solution for injection is insulin aspart, a rapid-acting insulin 
analogue, administered subcutaneously by injection in the abdominal wall, the thigh, the upper arm, the 
deltoid region or the gluteal region. The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin aspart is due to the facilitated 
uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous 
inhibition of glucose output from the liver. Insulin Aspart is also used for intravenous administration by 
physicians or other healthcare staff as applicable.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
An euglycaemic clamp study was conducted in order to demonstrate similarity between PD of MYL-1601 and 
NovoRapid and NovoLog, respectively (Study MYL-1601D-1001). PD endpoints were obtained from glucose 
infusion rates measured by the ClampArt device over a period of 12 hours following an s.c. injection of 0.2 
U/kg of MYL-1601D or NovoRapid or NovoLog. During the entire glucose clamp, the device measured blood 
glucose continuously, and the respective GIR was recorded every minute.  
Primary PD Endpoints: 
•  AUCGIR,0-last, area under the glucose infusion rate curve from 0 hours until the end of clamp 
•  GIRmax, maximum glucose infusion rate 
Secondary PD Endpoints: 
•  AUCGIR,0-4h, area under the glucose infusion rate curve from 0 to 4 hours 
•  AUCGIR,0-6h, area under the glucose infusion rate curve from 0 to 6 hours 
•  AUCGIR,6-last, area under the glucose infusion rate curve from 6 hours until the end of clamp 
• 
• 
• 
tmax.GIR, time to maximum glucose infusion rate 
tGIR,50%-early, time to half-maximum glucose infusion rate before GIRmax 
tGIR,50%-late, time to half-maximum glucose infusion rate after GIRmax (indicator of end of duration of 
action) 
•  Onset of action, time from trial product administration until blood glucose concentration has 
decreased at least 5 mg/dL from baseline, where baseline is defined as the mean of blood glucose 
levels from -6, -4, and -2 minutes before trial product administration as measured by ClampArt  
•  Duration of action, as defined by difference between tGIR,50%-late and onset of action (as defined 
above). 
Standard statistical PK methods were applied in the analysis of the PD data. In the comparison with NovoLog, 
90% CI was used (and were also used for the submission to the FDA), whereas in the comparison with 
NovoRapid 95% CI was used (for the EMA submission) in order to demonstrate similar pharmacodynamics of 
MYL-1601D and NovoLog and NovoRapid. 
Furthermore, two sets of sensitivity analyses were conducted: i) where data from all subjects including low 
responders were used, and ii) where profiles with predefined C-peptide criteria were excluded. 
Pharmacodynamic results 
Figure 2 shows the overlaid mean smoothed GIR profiles of the three insulin aspart products, and Table 5 
displays the results of the statistical comparisons for the PD endpoints.  
The 90% and 95% confidence intervals of the primary PD endpoints (AUCGIR,0h-last and GIRmax) lie within the 
prespecified range. The results from the sensitivity analysis, in which 2 subjects meeting the C-peptide 
criteria were excluded, showed similar estimates and CI as the main analysis. 
In accordance with the lower insulin exposure of MYL-1601D at the end of the clamp (see PK section), the 
glucose infusion rate at the end of the clamp (from 6 hours onwards) are lower for MYL-1601D than Novolog, 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 43/90 
 
  
  
but the 90% CI does not exceed the prespecified limits (80%-125%). No differences in glucose infusion rate 
between MYL-1601D and NovoRapid at the end of the clamp were observed.  
The secondary end-points: time to maximum glucose infusion rate, time until 50% of GIRmax(early), time until 
50% of GIRmax(late), onset of action and duration of action did not differ substantially between MYL-1601D, 
NovoRapid and NovoLog.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Methodology 
A single dose euglycaemic clamp study (MYL-1601D-1001) investigated the equivalence in pharmacokinetics 
between MYL-1601D and NovoRapid (EU-approved) and NovoLog (US-Licensed). The study was conducted in 
healthy men and women, and no studies in the target population were conducted. Clamp studies in healthy 
subjects are acceptable provided the evidence is presented that during the clamp period, the endogenous 
insulin secretion was completely supressed. Indeed, the MAH followed the C-peptide levels during the study. 
The study was considered well conducted and the comparison between treatment groups are considered 
adequate.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The 90% confidence interval of the primary PK end-points (AUC(0-12h) and Cmax) were within the predefined 
limits (80%-125%) for the comparison with NovoLog (US-licensed) as well as NovoRapid (EU-approved). 
Thus, similar pharmacokinetics between MYL-1601D, NovoLog and NovoRapid were documented.   
At the end of the clamp, high variability was observed, and AUC was lower for MYL-1601D than Novorapid 
and NovoLog. This finding does not alone preclude biosimilarity. 
Overall, the study was well-conducted, and similar pharmacokinetics of MYL-1601D, NovoLog and NovoRapid 
are considered documented 
Pharmacodynamics 
In the euglycaemic clamp study, pharmacodynamics were also investigated. Two primary pharmacodynamic 
endpoints (area under the glucose infusion rate curve from 0 hours until the end of clamp and the maximum 
glucose infusion rate), and other relevant secondary endpoints were investigated. The 95% confidence 
interval of the primary PD endpoints lie within the predefined range (80%-125%) for the comparison with 
NovoRapid, which is in accordance with the EMA guideline. For the comparison with NovoLog, the 90% 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 45/90 
 
  
  
 
confidence interval was used due to the FDA requirements and was within the predefined range (80%-
125%).  
Overall, similar pharmacodynamic profiles have been demonstrated of MYL-1601D, NovoLog and NovoRapid. 
The totality of clinical PK/PD data support biosimilarity between MYL-1601D and NovoLog (US-licensed) and 
NovoRapid (EU-approved). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The available PK/PD data support biosimilarity between MYL-1601D and NovoRapid (EU approved) and 
NovoLog (US licenced). NovoLog is representative of the EU reference medicinal product (NovoRapid). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Mylan insulin aspart, MYL-1601D is being developed by Mylan as a similar biological medicinal product to US-
licensed NovoLog® (NovoLog) and EU-approved NovoRapid® (NovoRapid) for use in the same indications as 
approved in each region. In accordance with EMA Guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1 and 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1), the development 
program has aimed to establish similarity of MYL-1601D to the reference medicinal product (NovoRapid®) in 
terms of physicochemical characteristics, biological activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and 
safety and efficacy, including immunogenicity.

Study MYL-1601D-1001 
Methods 
71 healthy subjects aged 18 to 65 years, body mass index between 18.5 and 29.0 kg/m² and fasting plasma 
glucose ≤ 100 mg/dL were exposed to IMP (70 to MYL-1601D, 69 to NovoLog®, and 67 to NovoRapid®) with 
dosing of 0.2 U/kg body weight of each product. Safety endpoints included adverse events (AEs) including 
hypoglycemic episodes, hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, Anti-insulin antibodies, physical examination, 
vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and local tolerability/reactions at the injection site.  
Study MYL-1601D-3001 
Methods 
Study design 
500 subjects, 18 to 65 years of age, with clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least 6 months 
or more, with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 6.5-10%, on stable dose of once daily basal Lantus® or 
Toujeo® injection and multiple daily bolus NovoLog® or Humalog® injections for at least 3 months were 
planned to be included in the trial. 
All patients were shifted to Lantus as basal insulin and FlexPen NovoLog in the screening phase and 
randomised to one of the following treatments in the treatment period: 
• 
• 
MYL-1601D Product (100 U/mL) or  
FlexPen NovoLog (100 U/mL)  
taken at mealtime. 
The study was a 24-week randomised, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group phase 3 study in subjects with 
T1DM comparing the safety and efficacy of MYL-1601D with NovoLog® (figure 9-1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 47/90 
 
  
  
 
After a screening period of up to 3 weeks, all subjects were titrated on NovoLog during a 4-week run-in 
period and were shifted from their current basal insulin to study insulin Lantus. After the run-in period, 
subjects were randomized; 1 group received MYL-1601D, while the other group received NovoLog for 24 
weeks. A follow-up visit, via telephone call, was scheduled 4 weeks after last dose of MYL-1601D or NovoLog. 
A total of 500 subjects with T1DM were planned to be randomized in this study, to receive MYL-1601D or 
NovoLog with a randomization ratio of 1:1 (N = 250 subjects per treatment group). 
Dosing with NovoLog during the run-in period and MYL-1601D or NovoLog during the treatment period was 
guided by SMBG-based glucose level assessments 
Objectives: 
The primary objective of study MYL-1601D-3001 was to assess treatment emergent antibody response 
(TEAR) at week 24 of MYL-1601D and compare to the reference product NovoLog. Additional measures of 
immunogenicity, efficacy and safety were assessed and compared between treatment groups. Of interest, the 
impact of ADAs on PD parameters were analysed. 
Endpoints: 
Primary Endpoint 
The TEAR rate during the 24-week treatment period was the primary endpoint for this study. 
A TEAR was defined as either one of the following: 
1. Subjects who were ADA negative at baseline and became positive at any time point post-baseline. 
2. Subjects who were ADA positive at baseline and demonstrated 4-fold increase in titer values at any time 
point post-baseline. 
Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary endpoints were change from baseline to Week 24.

6.  Incidence of local reactions (includes injection site reaction), systemic reactions 
7.  Incidence of hypersensitivity and immune mediated AEs 
8.  Incidence of device related safety assessment 
Sample size, randomization, blinding and statistical analyses: 
The sample size estimation is based on primary objective – “to demonstrate that 
immunogenicity as assessed by treatment emergent antibody response (TEAR) rate with MYL-1601D is 
equivalent to that of NovoLog® during 24-week treatment” as recommended by the US-FDA. 
The randomisation procedure is adequately described. The randomisation was stratified by investigator and 
basal insulin dose and those were included as covariates in the statistical analyses. The design was open 
label, which could in principle have affected some of the endpoints. The primary endpoint was conducted with 
the ITT population. 
A site was excluded from the analysis due to GCP compliance issues. This was done before data lock.

The sensitivity analysis pointed in the same direction as the analysis of the primary endpoint, with an 
exception of the positive imputation showing a statistically significant higher TEAR rate (Figure 2). This 
represents an extreme situation, and as the majority of the scenarios (95.4%) points towards no difference 
between groups, the sensitivity analyses are considered to support the primary analysis.

Clinical studies in special populations 
The majority of the patients were between 21 and 65 years old (N=441). In the youngest age group (<= 21 
years) 25 patients were included. In the oldest age group (>= 65 years) 12 patients were included. Patients 
were evenly distributed between treatment groups within each age group.  
There was a tendency towards a higher TEAR rate in the youngest age group, however the TEAR rate did not 
differ between treatment groups, neither in the youngest age group nor in the older age groups (Table 11-
26).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing 
recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1) declares no 
anticipated need for specific efficacy studies, since endpoints (usually HbA1c) used in such studies are not 
considered sensitive enough to detect potentially clinically relevant differences between two insulins. 
The clinical study program for MYL-1601D includes two clinical studies, namely study MYL-1601D-1001 
(including single-dosing of the three IMPs in 71 healthy subjects) and study MYL-1601D-3001.The efficacy 
evaluation is based on the MYL-1601D-3001 study due to the single-dose application of investigational 
medicinal products in study MYL-1601D-1001. The data from study MYL-1601D-3001 has been submitted 
with the day 121 response.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In line with regulatory guidance, a 24-week study with the primary objective to demonstrate comparable 
immunogenicity has been conducted. The final CSR has been submitted with the Day 120 question 
responses.  
A randomised, open-label, parallel-group phase 3 study in patients with type 1 diabetes was conducted. The 
primary objective of study MYL-1601D-3001 was to assess treatment emergent antibody response (TEAR) at 
week 24 of MYL-1601D and compare to the reference product NovoLog. Additional measures of 
immunogenicity, efficacy and safety were assessed and compared between treatment groups. Of interest, the 
impact of ADAs on PD parameters was analysed. The primary and secondary endpoints are supported and the 
definition of TEAR is agreed.  
The open-label design is not expected to have an impact on the primary endpoint measuring immunogenicity. 
Some effect on other endpoints, including use of supplementary insulin, could in principle be affected as 
patients may be more alert if they know they are in the MYL-1601D arm. No major differences were noticed 
however.  
The statistical methods are acceptable. A site was excluded from the analysis due to GCP compliance issues. 
This was done before data lock and is therefore acceptable. The primary endpoint was conducted with the ITT 
population, which is agreed. 
More than 90 % in both treatment groups completed treatment. There were no apparent differences between 
groups in reasons for discontinuations. Patients who discontinued treatment were invited to stay in the study. 
This is endorsed.   
Overall, the study appears to be well-conducted.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. Only two patients had a prior history of 
treatment with immunosuppressants (1 methotrexate, 1 other), both in the NovoLog treatment group. There 
were no apparent differences seen with the medical history between the treatment groups and there were no 
differences in treatment compliance. Overall, the treatment groups are comparable.  
The ITT set included 478 patients, and the PP analysis set 432 patients.   
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 63/90 
 
  
  
The primary endpoint, the TEAR rate, was 59/238 (24.9%) for MYL-1601D, and 67/240 (27.8%) for NovoLog 
with a treatment difference of -2.86% (90% CI -9.71; 3.99), which is in the prespecified margin of ±12%. 
Analysis of the secondary endpoints showed stable HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, prandial and basal insulin 
dose during 24 weeks of treatment.  
The Applicant has conducted several sensitivity analyses in order to address the missing data. The sensitivity 
analysis pointed in the same direction, with an exception of the positive imputation showing a statistically 
significant higher TEAR rate with MYL-1601D compared with NovoLog. It is agreed with the Applicant that this 
represents an extreme situation in which all the missing values is imputed as positive antibody response. As 
the majority of the scenarios (95.4%) points towards no difference between groups, the sensitivity analyses 
are considered to support the primary analysis.   
The majority of the included patients were between 21 and 65 years old (N=441). In the youngest age group 
(<= 21 years) 25 patients were included. In the oldest age group (>= 65 years) 12 patients were included. 
Patients were evenly distributed between treatment groups within each age group. There was a tendency 
towards a higher TEAR rate in the youngest age group, however the TEAR rate did not differ between 
treatment groups, neither in the youngest age group nor in the older age groups.  
In conclusion, based on the results of the primary and secondary endpoints and the sensitivity analyses, no 
differences in TEAR were observed between MYL-1601D and NovoLog, and no differences in effect 
parameters were observed. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, study MYL-1601D-3001 is considered well-conducted and no difference in TEAR and other efficacy 
endpoints were observed between MYL-1601D and the reference medicinal product. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
In accordance with EMA Guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005_Rev1 and 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1), the development program has aimed to establish similarity of MYL-
1601D to the reference medicinal product (NovoRapid®) in terms of safety, including immunogenicity. 
Patient exposure 
The clinical study program for MYL-1601D includes the two studies summarized in table 2 below. Study MYL-
1601D-1001 was an euglycemic clamp study in healthy volunteers, and study 3001 was a randomised, 
multicentre, open-label, parallel-group clinical study comparing the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of 
MYL-1601D with NovoLog® in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) patients.

The designs of the two clinical studies imply that safety evaluation should mainly be based on the MYL-
1601D-3001 study. Data from study MYL-1601D-3001 have been submitted with the day 121 response, and 
the evaluation of safety is primarily based on this study. In the following, the evaluation of safety in study 
3001 is provided first, and subsequently the evaluation of study 1001 is provided.  
Study MYL-1601D-3001 
The safety population from study 3001 consisted of 478 patients of which 238 had at least one dose of MYL-
1601-D (Table 12-1). The baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Around half of the 
patients were men and the majority were of white ethnicity. Mean diabetes duration was 21-22 years, and 
34-35% had hypertension. Overall, the characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups, and 
the population included in study 3001 is adequately reflecting an adult type 1 diabetes population.

Adverse events 
The proportion of patients with treatment emergent adverse events was numerically higher for MYL-1601D 
(45.4%) compared with NovoLog (42.9%). The number of events were also higher with MYL-1601D (256) 
compared with NovoLog (231). Additionally, the percentage of patients with at least 1 severe adverse event 
or TEAE grade 3 or higher was numerically higher for MYL-1601D (9.2% and 9.2%) compared with NovoLog 
(6.3% and 5.8%). 3 patients treated with MYL-1601D discontinued treatment due to TEAE whereas 1 patient 
treated with NovoLog discontinued treatment due to TEAE. One patient died. This patient was in the NovoLog 
group. 
The specific adverse events were similar between the treatment groups, besides hypoglycaemia, headache 
and diarrhoea that were more pronounced in the MYL-1601D group than NovoLog. 17 patients (7.1%) in the 
MYL-1601D group had a hypoglycaemic event whereas 10 patients (4.2%) in the NovoLog group had a 
hypoglycaemic event.  
Overall, the number of subjects experiencing an adverse event, and the number of events were higher in the 
MYL-1601D group than in the NovoLog group. The difference is considered small (108 patients out of 238 vs 
105 patients out of 240). The Applicant discusses that the higher frequency of adverse events can be 
attributed to the open label study design, which is agreed.

The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 TEAE were 5.5% and 3.8% in the MYL-1601D group, respectively, and 4.6% 
and 0.8% in the NovoLog group, respectively (Table 12-6).

The treatment related adverse events were low in both treatment groups (7.6% vs. 4.2%), and were mostly 
attributed to hypoglycaemia (Table 12-7). 
Among patients in the MYL-1601D treatment group, 17 subjects (7.1%) had an incidence of hypoglycaemia 
in contrast to 10 subjects (4.2%) in the NovoLog group.  
The Applicant also reports that 218 (91.6%) patients in the MYL-1601D group and 222 (92.5%) patients in 
the NovoLog group reported a hypoglycaemic event at any visit.  
The hypoglycaemic event rate and nocturnal hypoglycaemic events were similar for the two treatment groups 
over time (Figure 12-2 and Figure 12-4).  
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 71/90 
 
  
  
 
 
Overall, the differences in hypoglycaemic events between treatment groups might be due to the unblinded 
design, and the subjects in the experimental treatment arm might have had more glucose measures taken. 
No information regarding the number of glucose measurements were collected during the study.  
There were no differences between treatment groups in device related adverse events, local allergic reaction, 
systemic allergic reactions, hypersensitivity or immune mediated adverse events. Discontinuation due to 
adverse events was low, and there were no relevant differences in discontinuation between treatment 
groups.

In one patient an abnormal ECG finding was observed at week 24. This patient had a normal ECG at baseline. 
The ECG showed left axis deviation, moderate voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. and left atrial 
hemiblock. The abnormal ECG is not considered related to the drug, rather to the disease under treatment 
(type 1 diabetes). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events were numerically higher in patients treated with MYL-1605D compared with NovoLog. 
During the treatment period, 22 subjects (9.2%) in the MYL-1601D group reported 27 serious adverse events 
and 15 (6.3%) patients in the NovoLog group reported 23 serious adverse events (Table 5). Hypoglycaemia 
was the only event reported more than once per treatment group.  
One patient in the NovoLog group was a victim of a homicide and died.

Safety in special populations 
Safety parameters have not been reported across age-groups. The majority of the patients were between 21 
and 65 years old (N=441). In the youngest age group (<= 21 years) 25 patients were included. In the oldest 
age group (>= 65 years) 12 patients were included. Treatment emergent antibody response in relation to 
age is addressed in the efficacy section.

Immunological events 
The majority of patients had positive ADA at baseline (Table 12-18). There were no differences between 
treatment groups in patients with newly positive ADA post-baseline or patients experiencing a 4-fold increase 
in antibodies. 
In patients with TEAR post-baseline, the incidence of neutralising antibodies was low and comparable 
between groups. As such, the 4 patients (7.7%) in the MYL-1601D had neutralising antibodies and 4 patients 
(7.0%) in the Novolog group had neutralising antibodies. In patients who were TEAR negative, 24 patients 
(14.7%) in the MYL-1601D group and 20 patients (12.7%) in the NovoLog group had neutralising antibodies.  
HbA1c, insulin dose, hypoglycaemic events and injection site reactions/hypersensitive were analysed by TEAR 
status. There was a tendency towards a small increase in HbA1c for MYL-1601D and a small decrease in HbA1c 
for Novolog in TEAR positive patients, whereas there was no difference between treatment group in TEAR 
negative patients. The difference in HbA1c at week 24 between MYL-1601D and NovoLog in TEAR positive 
patients was 0.26%-point (95% CI: -0.03, 0.56). The differences at 26 weeks could be due to a minor 
decrease in daily insulin dose during the first 4 weeks in the MYL1601D group, which is not considered 
caused by TEAR. The difference is not statistically significant and is not considered clinically relevant (Figure 
12-6).

Study MYL-1601D-1001 
Adverse events 
In study MYL-1601D-1001, 11 subjects (15.7%) experienced at least one TEAE after administration of MYL-
1601D, 13 subjects (19.4%) after administration of NovoRapid® and 11 subjects (15.9%) after 
administration of NovoLog®. Overall, 18, 13 and 12 TEAEs were reported for MYL-1601D, NovoRapid® and 
NovoLog®, respectively. Most of the 43 TEAEs were of mild (24 events) or moderate (18 events) intensity. 
One TEAE was severe (influenza, which was unrelated to IMP). All TEAEs had the outcome 
recovered/resolved. 
The number of drug-related TEAEs was comparable between treatments (4 events for MYL-1601D, 5 events 
for NovoRapid® and 3 events for NovoLog®). These events included moderate nausea (1 event), injection site 
erythema (4 mild events), hypoglycemia (2 mild events) and headache (5 events).

A total of 5 subjects (of 72 subjects) had confirmed positive ADA sample results at any time point during the 
MYL-1601-1001 study. One subject (subject 030) had a treatment-induced antibody response, while 4 
subjects were already positive at visit 2a, prior to dosing. The relative ADA levels in all positive samples was 
low, ranging between 4.78 and 7.59 %/bound/total. 
Subject 030 was ADA negative at visit 2a (baseline), but positive on visit 2b following administration of MYL-
1601D, and returned to negative at visit 3. At visit 2b, the percent inhibition after incubation with each drug 
product was 35.20%, 36.45%, and 36.14% for MYL- 1601D, NovoLog® and NovoRapid®, respectively. 
Comparability of the percent inhibition values indicates that the ADA present in this sample was cross-
reactive with each drug product and arose from a common epitope. No cross-reactivity to human insulin was 
observed for this sample. The subject had PK and PD parameters similar to the other subjects and only one 
AE (influenza), reported several days after visit 3. In summary, immunogenicity assessments did not show an 
increased ADA reactivity for MYL-1601D compared to NovoLog® or NovoRapid®, since the majority of 
subjects lacked any detectable immunogenicity response against insulin aspart or had relevant antibody 
levels pre-dose at visit 2a with no treatment boosting. Only one subject had a treatment-induced transient 
ADA reaction to MYL-1601D, with a similar percent inhibition for MYL-1601D, NovoLog® and NovoRapid®. For 
further information related to the assessment of the novel proinsulin impurity and its impact on safety please 
refer to section “2.6.1 Discussion on clinical safety” below. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
None of the AEs resulted in a discontinuation of study drug.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical study program for MYL-1601D includes two clinical studies, namely study MYL-1601D-1001 
(including single-dosing of the three IMPs in 71 healthy subjects) and study MYL-1601D-3001. These study 
designs imply that safety evaluation should mainly be based on the MYL-1601D-3001 study. The safety 
database is considered acceptable.  
It is acknowledged that safety studies for similar biological medicinal products containing insulin analogues 
should be performed with specific focus on immunogenicity (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1), and 
the clinical study program for MYL-1601D is considered reasonable. Overall, the provided preliminary safety 
evaluation based on data from study MYL-1601D-1001 is considered to be of limited value due the single-
dose application of MYL-1601D in this study.  
The proposed primary objective of study MYL-1601D-3001 is to demonstrate that immunogenicity as 
assessed by treatment emergent antibody response (TEAR) rate with MYL-1601D is equivalent to that of 
NovoLog® during 24-week treatment. The “Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar 
biological medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues” 
[EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1] recommends a duration of 6 months for immunogenicity studies of 
biosimilar insulins as anti-drug antibodies are expected to develop early-on. 
However, Scientific Advice received stated that the current issue is not the immunogenicity of aspart insulin 
but the immunogenicity of the novel proinsulin impurity. The Applicant has discussed that the proinsulin 
impurity is present only at very low levels in the MYL-1601D drug product, and the risk of antibody 
generation against this impurity is considered low.

Study 3001 was a randomised, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group clinical study comparing the safety, 
immunogenicity, and efficacy of MYL-1601D with NovoLog in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) patients. 
The safety population from study 3001 consisted of 478 patients of which 238 had at least one dose of MYL-
1601-D. The baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Overall, the characteristics 
were well balanced between treatment groups, and the population included in study 3001 is adequately 
reflecting an adult type 1 diabetes population.  
Adverse events 
Overall, the number of subjects experiencing an adverse event, and the number of events were higher in the 
MYL-1601D group than in the NovoLog group. The difference is considered small (108 patients out of 238 vs 
105 patients out of 240). The Applicant discusses that the higher frequency of adverse events can be 
attributed to the open label study design, which is agreed. Hypoglycaemia was the most frequent adverse 
event and was also the most frequent adverse event related to the treatment. 
Among patients in the MYL-1601D treatment group, 17 subjects (7.1%) had an incidence of hypoglycaemia 
in contrast to 10 subjects (4.2%) in the NovoLog group.  
The Applicant also reports that 218 (91.6%) patients in the MYL-1601D group and 222 (92.5%) patients in 
the NovoLog group reported a hypoglycaemic event at any visit.  
The hypoglycaemic event rate and nocturnal hypoglycaemic events were similar for the two treatment groups 
over time.  
Overall, the differences in hypoglycaemic events between treatment groups might be due to the unblinded 
design, and the subjects in the experimental treatment arm might have had more glucose measurements 
taken. No information regarding the number of glucose measurements were collected during the study. 
There were no differences between treatment groups in device related adverse events, local allergic reaction, 
systemic allergic reactions, hypersensitivity or immune mediated adverse events. Discontinuation due to 
adverse events was low, and there were no relevant differences in discontinuation between treatment 
groups.  
In one patient an abnormal ECG finding was observed at week 24, and the abnormal ECG finding is not 
considered related to the drug, rather to the disease under treatment (type 1 diabetes). 
The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 TEAE were 5.5% and 3.8% in the MYL-1601D group, respectively, and 4.6% 
and 0.8% in the NovoLog group, respectively. The higher frequency in the MYL-1601D group is considered 
due to the open label design of the study. 
Safety parameters have not been reported across age-groups. Treatment emergent antibody response in 
relation to age is addressed in the efficacy section. This is acceptable.  
Serious adverse events 
Serious adverse events were numerically higher in patients treated with MYL-1605D compared with NovoLog. 
During the treatment period, 22 subjects (9.2%) in the MYL-1601D group reported 27 serious adverse events 
and 15 (6.3%) patients in the NovoLog group reported 23 serious adverse events. Hypoglycaemia was the 
only event reported more than once per treatment group. The Applicant states that 10 of the patients in the 
MYL-1601D treatment group and 5 patients in the NovoLog group had contributing factors to hypoglycaemia, 
e.g. excessive physical activity, irregular diet, alcohol consumption, or not taking medication/incorrect dose. 
This is considered acceptable.  
One patient in the NovoLog group was a victim of a homicide and died.

The majority of patients had positive ADA at baseline. There were no differences between treatment groups 
in patients with newly positive ADA post-baseline or patients experiencing a 4-fold increase in antibodies. 
In conclusion, there were no differences in neutralising antibodies between treatment groups and the 
incidence of neutralising antibodies was low, and no differences in the incidence of neutralising antibodies 
with respect to TEAR status were observed.  
HbA1c, insulin dose, hypoglycaemic events and injection site reactions/hypersensitive were analysed by TEAR 
status. There was a tendency towards a small increase in HbA1c for MYL-1601D and a small decrease in HbA1c 
for Novolog in TEAR positive patients, whereas there was no difference between treatment group in TEAR 
negative patients. The difference between treatment arms among TEAR positive patients is not considered 
clinically relevant and is likely to be caused by an initial lower daily insulin dose in the MYL-1601D group. 
There were no overall differences in daily insulin dose, hypoglycaemic events, injection site reactions or 
hypersensitivity between treatment groups in TEAR positive patients.   
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
This application is a centralised procedure made according to Article 10(4), Directive 2001/83/EC, biosimilar 
application. MYL-1601D, insulin aspart, solution for injection, has been developed as a biosimilar of 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 83/90 
 
  
  
 
NovoRapid/Novolog (insulin aspart 100 U/ml) which is marketed by Novo Nordisk A/S and authorized in the 
EU since 1999. The Applicant is seeking approval for the same indication as NovoRapid: 
 “Kixelle is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and 
above.” 
Demonstration of biosimilarity of MYL-1601D to the reference product NovoRapid/NovoLog was based on in 
vivo and in vitro studies, non-clinical studies, a human PK/PD study and a phase 3 immunogenicity study, as 
described below. 
Quality 
Insulin aspart is a relatively small and less complex protein molecule enabling thorough and reliable 
comparison of quality attributes covering structure and impurity pattern. The finished product formulations of 
MYL-1601D and the reference product NovoRapid® are highly similar.  
The MYL-1601D solution for s.c. injection is presented in cartridges and pre-filled pens, which are also the 
common presentations of the reference product.  
A comprehensive analytical comparability study was performed to evaluate the similarity between MYL-1601D 
and the reference product NovoRapid®.  
The Applicant’s strategy to establish similarity of MYL-1601D with the reference product is endorsed. The 
attributes tested in the biosimilarity study focus in particular on structure, impurity pattern and biological 
activity and they cover all attributes relevant for the analytical comparison.  
A considerable number of batches have been analysed and the number of finished product batches chosen for 
each test is appropriate to accommodate the expected variability of the analytical methods.  
The MYL-1601D DP batches included in the analytical studies are considered sufficiently representative for 
the commercial product. Their age at the time of testing is generally lower compared to the age of the 
reference batches of the EU sourced and the US sourced products. The comparative stability and forced 
degradation studies indicate comparable degradation rates of MYL-1601D and the reference product.  
Quantitative results for the parameters tested have been presented in clear graphs where the results from all 
three products (MYL-1601D, NovoRapid and NovoLog) are presented. This graphical presentation enables a 
satisfactory comparison of results.  
Biosimilarity between Kixelle and NovoRapid/NovoLog has been demonstrated. 
Non-clinical 
In the non-clinical part of the assessment, in vitro pharmacology studies are vital to show biosimilarity, 
whereas in vivo studies should only be performed when needed.   
In the current MAA, a sufficient number of in vitro pharmacology studies have been performed in order to 
assess receptor binding, receptor phosphorylation and metabolic activity for MYL-1601D insulin aspart and 
NovoRapid (and NovoLog) in accordance with guideline (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/ 32775/2005 Rev. 1, 2015). The 
methods used in the in vitro pharmacology studies are acceptable and sensitive enough to detect difference 
between the test and the reference compounds. The number of tested batches and the number of 
runs/replicates are sufficient. Additionally, the batch used in the clinical study MYL-1601D-1001 was tested in 
all in vitro studies.  In addition to the conducted in vitro pharmacology studies, the current MAA also included 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021

two in vivo toxicity studies. However, in vivo toxicity studies are not a requirement according to EMA 
guidelines due to the low sensitivity of the studies for conclusion on biosimilarity and hence the animal 
studies are unnecessary from a 3R perspective (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/ 32775/2005_Rev.1).     
Clinical 
The clinical development consisted a single dose PK/PD euglycaemic clamp study in 72 healthy volunteers 
comparing MYL-1601D with NovoRapid (EU approved) and NovoLog (US licenced) (Study MYL-1601D-1001).  
The PK/PD study was conducted in accordance with EMA Guideline on the non-clinical and clinical 
development of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin 
analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_1). Furthermore, a phase 3 immunogenicity and efficacy study 
(24-week, open label, randomised, parallel-group) in type 1 diabetes patients comparing MYL-1601D with 
NovoLog was submitted with the day 121 response (Study MYL-1601D-3001). 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
Structural biosimilarity between the MYL-1601D test product and NovoRapid reference product and the 
comparator NovoLog was studied by applying numerous state-of-the-art methods. They all demonstrate 
similarity in terms of primary (i.e., amino acid sequence), secondary, tertiary structure and molecular mass. 
Likewise, protein content and pI of the MYL-1601D test product was shown to fall into the quality range of 
NovoRapid reference product and to be comparable between NovoRapid and the comparator NovoLog. 
Purity and impurity of MYL-1601D DP, NovoRapid and NovoLog has been assessed. Determination of HMWPs 
concluded that the level of HMWPs is similar in MYL-1601D compared to the levels found in the reference 
product. This is considered acceptable. 
A novel proinsulin impurity was detected in MYL-1601D. This impurity cannot be found in the EU reference 
product. Insulin The novel impurity is being monitored and controlled during downstream process of the MYL-
1601D DS manufacturing process. 
Biological activity in terms of in vitro metabolic and in vitro mitogenic activity was investigated. The results of 
the similarity studies concerning the biological activity of the product, demonstrated similar biological 
activity. The biological activity of MYL-1601D is therefore considered to be similar to that of NovoRapid. 
The preservatives m-cresol and phenol are present in the same concentrations in MYL-1601D compared to 
the reference product. The pH of MYL-1601D batches is very close to the physiological pH. 
Non-clinical 
The Applicant has performed comparative receptor binding studies on the two human insulin receptors (IR-A 
and IR-B), including on-off kinetics, with the product under review MYL-1601D and the reference product 
NovoRapid (and NovoLog). Additionally, receptor binding assays were also performed for the IGF-1 receptor. 
Biological activity was measured by autophosphorylation of IR-A and IR-B, by inhibition of lipolysis, 
stimulation of glucose uptake, adipogenesis and mitogenesis of Saos2 cells. 
The choice of studies is in accordance with the guideline (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/ 32775/2005 Rev. 1, 2015). 
The mean, standard deviation and comparability range of the tested batches of the EU reference product

NovoRapid, NovoLog and MYL-1601D was presented in the table below. Minimum and maximum potency 
values of MYL-161D were within the lower and upper limit for the EU reference product NovoRapid (and 
NovoLog). The only exception was the upper limit of the inhibition of stimulated lipolysis which diverged 
slightly compared to the upper limit of NovoRapid. Overall, this was considered sufficient to support 
biosimilarity from a non-clinical point of view.  
Clinical 
For the primary PK endpoints, AUC(0-12h) and Cmax, the 90% confidence intervals were within the predefined 
limits (80% and 125%) for the comparison with NovoLog as well as NovoRapid. Thus, similar 
pharmacokinetics between MYL-1601D, NovoLog (US-licensed) and NovoRapid (EU-approved) were 
documented. 
For one of the secondary PK endpoints, AUC(6-12h) the ratio between MYL-1601D and NovoLog was 75.60 
(61.38; 92.16), and the ratio between MYL-1601D and NovoRapid was 81.37 (62.70; 105.75) and therefore 
outside the predefined limits of biosimilarity. The Applicant argues that high variability was present at the 
end of the clamp study due to a limited number of measurements. This argument is agreed. The study met 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 86/90 
 
  
  
 
its primary endpoints, other secondary endpoints are supportive and the results of AUC(6-12h) do not alone 
question biosimilarity. AUC measures for all other timepoints were within the 80%-125 % limits.  
The mean T½ for MYL-1601D, NovoRapid and NovoLog were 0.88 h, 0.89 h and 0.93 h, respectively, and are 
considered similar. 
The 90% and 95% confidence intervals of the primary PD endpoints (AUCGIR,0h-last and GIRmax) lie within the 
prespecified range, demonstrating similar glucose lowering effect of MYL-1601D and NovoLog, and 
NovoRapid, respectively. No differences in glucose infusion rate between MYL-1601D and NovoRapid at the 
end of the clamp were observed.  
The secondary end-points: time to maximum glucose infusion rate, time until 50% of GIRmax(early), time until 
50% of GIRmax(late), onset of action and duration of action did not differ substantially between MYL-1601D, 
NovoRapid and NovoLog.  
The Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing 
recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1) declares no 
anticipated need for specific efficacy studies, since endpoints (usually HbA1c) used in such studies are not 
considered sensitive enough to detect potentially clinically relevant differences between two insulins. Due to a 
novel proinsulin impurity a phase III immunogenicity study was requested. The 24-week immunogenicity 
study showed no differences in treatment emergent antibody response between the MYL-1601D group and 
the NovoLog group and no differences in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose or insulin requirements during the 
follow-up between the two treatment groups.  
Insulin aspart (NovoRapid) was first approved by European Medicine Agency (EMA) in 1999. The safety and 
tolerability profile for insulin aspart is considered well-established based on clinical trials and the use in 
diabetes patients since marketing authorization. The RMP version 3.1 for insulin aspart (NovoRapid and 
NovoMix) dated January 2018 includes no important identified or potential risks for NovoRapid. It is described 
that the important risks are well described in the proposed product information and appropriately managed 
by routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality 
The analytical studies in 3.2R present evidence to conclude similarity of MYL-1601D and NovoRapid®.  
Non-clinical 
In the current MAA, non-clinical biosimilarity has been confirmed between MYL-1601D and the EU reference 
NovoRapid (and NovoLog) based on the in vitro pharmacology studies for receptor binding and metabolic 
activity in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
It should, however, be noted that the relative potencies of the compounds were calculated toward an internal 
working reference standard (IWRS) instead of comparing data head-to-head as stated in the guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/ 32775/2005_Rev. 1). However, EC50/IC50 values of the functional in vitro 
pharmacology studies were provided, and showed visual overlap of EC50 values of MYL-1601D, NovoRapid, 
NovoLog and the IWRS in the different assays. Additionally, individual concentration-effect curves of each 
biological activity assay, all showed the classic sigmoid shape and the test compound curve overlapped with 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 87/90 
 
  
  
 
that of the IRWS. Furthermore, the IWRS have been sufficiently characterized in order to assess 
comparability between MYL-1601D, NovoRapid® and NovoLog®. Therefore, the totality of the data provided 
was considered sufficient to support non-clinical biosimilarity and the issue of the lacking head-to-head 
comparison will not be further pursued. 
Clinical 
No uncertainties regarding the comparability margins for PK and PD in the euglycaemic clamp study exist.  
The safety study was performed in order to clarify the immunogenicity of MYL-1601D. However, other safety 
parameters were also measured. There was a difference in hypoglycaemic events between the treatment 
groups, with a higher frequency in the MYL-1601D group. This is considered due to the unblinded design.  
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Non-clinical 
In conclusion, non-clinical biosimilarity has been confirmed between MYL-1601D and the EU reference 
NovoRapid based on the conducted in vitro studies in accordance with ICH guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/ 
BMWP/32775/2005 Rev. 1, 2015). 
Clinical 
A single dose euglycaemic clamp study investigated the equivalence in pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics between MYL-1601D and NovoRapid (EU-approved) and NovoLog (US-Licensed). The 
study was conducted in healthy subjects and was conducted in accordance with guidelines. The study was 
considered well conducted. 
The 90% confidence interval of the primary PK end-points (AUC(0-12h) and Cmax) were within the predefined 
limits (80%-125%) for the comparison with NovoLog (US-licensed) as well as NovoRapid (EU-approved). 
Thus, similar pharmacokinetics between MYL-1601D, NovoLog and NovoRapid were documented. At the end 
of the clamp, high variability was observed, and AUC was lower for MYL-1601D than Novorapid and NovoLog. 
This finding does not alone preclude biosimilarity. 
Two primary pharmacodynamic endpoints (area under the glucose infusion rate curve from 0 hours until the 
end of clamp and the maximum glucose infusion rate), and other relevant secondary endpoints were 
investigated. The 95% confidence interval of the primary PD endpoints lie within the predefined range (80%-
125%) for the comparison with NovoRapid, which is in accordance with the EMA guideline. For the 
comparison with NovoLog, the 90% confidence interval was used due to the FDA requirements and was 
within the predefined range (80%-125%).  
Overall, the PK/PD study was well conducted and similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles 
have been demonstrated of MYL-1601D, NovoLog and NovoRapid. The totality of clinical PK/PD data support 
biosimilarity between MYL-1601D and NovoLog (US-licensed) and NovoRapid (EU-approved).  
A 24-week, randomised, open label immunogenicity study was conducted comparing MYL-1601D with 
NovoLog (Study MYL-1601D-3001). No differences in treatment emergent antibody response were 
demonstrated between the treatment arms. However, a slight tendency towards increase in HbA1c in TEAR 
positive patients in MYL-1601D arm vs Novolog arm was observed, which is considered to be a consequence 
Assessment report  
EMA/64677/2021 
Page 88/90 
 
  
  
  
 
of a slightly lower insulin dose during the first 4 weeks in the MYL-1601D arm and not a consequence of TEAR 
positivity.  
In conclusion, clinical biosimilarity has been confirmed between MYL-1601D and NovoLog® in accordance with 
regulatory guidance.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Dacogen is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification,
who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Dacogen administration must be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the use of 
chemotherapeutic medicinal products.
Posology
In a treatment cycle, Dacogen is administered at a dose of 20 mg/m2 body surface area by intravenous 
infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 consecutive days (i.e., a total of 5 doses per treatment cycle). 
The total daily dose must not exceed 20 mg/m2 and the total dose per treatment cycle must not exceed 
100 mg/m2. If a dose is missed, treatment should be resumed as soon as possible. The cycle should be 
repeated every 4 weeks depending on the patient's clinical response and observed toxicity. It is 
recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 cycles; however, a complete or partial 
remission may take longer than 4 cycles to be obtained. Treatment may be continued as long as the 
patient shows response, continues to benefit or exhibits stable disease, i.e., in the absence of overt 
progression.
If after 4 cycles, the patient’s haematological values (e.g., platelet counts or absolute neutrophil count), 
have not returned to pre-treatment levels or if disease progression occurs (peripheral blast counts are 
increasing or bone marrow blast counts are worsening), the patient may be considered to be a 
non-responder and alternative therapeutic options to Dacogen should be considered.
Pre-medication for the prevention of nausea and vomiting is not routinely recommended but may be 
administered if required.
2
Management of myelosuppression and associated complications
Myelosuppression and adverse events related to myelosuppression (thrombocytopaenia, anaemia, 
neutropaenia, and febrile neutropaenia) are common in both treated and untreated patients with AML. 
Complications of myelosuppression include infections and bleeding. Treatment may be delayed at the 
discretion of the treating physician, if the patient experiences myelosuppression-associated 
complications, such as those described below:



Febrile neutropaenia (temperature ≥ 38.5°C and absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/µL)
Active viral, bacterial or fungal infection (i.e., requiring intravenous anti-infectives or extensive 
supportive care)
Haemorrhage (gastrointestinal, genito-urinary, pulmonary with platelets < 25,000/µL or any 
central nervous system haemorrhage)
Treatment with Dacogen may be resumed once these conditions have improved or have been stabilised
with adequate treatment (anti-infective therapy, transfusions, or growth factors).
In clinical studies, approximately one-third of patients receiving Dacogen required a dose-delay. Dose 
reduction is not recommended.
Paediatric population
Dacogen should not be used in children with AML aged < 18 years, because efficacy was not 
established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.
Hepatic impairment
Studies in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted. The need for dose adjustment in 
patients with hepatic impairment has not been evaluated. If worsening hepatic function occurs, patients 
should be carefully monitored (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Renal impairment
Studies in patients with renal impairment have not been conducted. The need for dose adjustment in 
patients with renal impairment has not been evaluated (see section 4.4 and 5.2).
Method of administration
Dacogen is administered by intravenous infusion. A central venous catheter is not required.
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to decitabine or to any of the excipients, listed in section 6.1.
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6)
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Myelosuppression
Myelosuppression and complications of myelosuppression, including infections and bleeding that 
occur in patients with AML may be exacerbated with Dacogen treatment. Therefore, patients are at 
increased risk for severe infections (due to any pathogen such as bacterial, fungal and viral), with 
potentially fatal outcome (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of
infection and treated promptly.
In clinical studies, the majority of patients had baseline Grade 3/4 myelosuppression. In patients with 
baseline Grade 2 abnormalities, worsening of myelosuppression was seen in most patients and more 
frequently than in patients with baseline Grade 1 or 0 abnormalities. Myelosuppression caused by 
Dacogen is reversible. Complete blood and platelet counts should be performed regularly, as clinically 
3
indicated and prior to each treatment cycle. In the presence of myelosuppression or its complications, 
treatment with Dacogen may be interrupted and/or supportive measures instituted (see sections 4.2 and 
4.8).
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders
Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (including pulmonary infiltrates, organising pneumonia and 
pulmonary fibrosis) without signs of infectious aetiology have been reported in patients receiving 
decitabine. Careful assessment of patients with an acute onset or unexplained worsening of pulmonary 
symptoms should be performed to exclude ILD. If ILD is confirmed, appropriate treatment should be 
initiated (see section 4.8).
Hepatic impairment
Use in patients with hepatic impairment has not been established. Caution should be exercised in the 
administration of Dacogen to patients with hepatic impairment and in patients who develop signs or 
symptoms of hepatic impairment. Liver function tests should be performed prior to initiation of 
therapy and prior to each treatment cycle, and as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Renal impairment
Use in patients with severe renal impairment has not been studied. Caution should be exercised in the 
administration of Dacogen to patients with severe renal impairment (Creatinine Clearance [CrCl]
< 30 ml/min). Renal function tests should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and prior to each 
treatment cycle, and as clinically indicated (see section 4.2).
Cardiac disease
Patients with a history of severe congestive heart failure or clinically unstable cardiac disease were 
excluded from clinical studies and therefore, the safety and efficacy of Dacogen in these patients has 
not been established. Cases of cardiomyopathy with cardiac decompensation, in some cases reversible 
after treatment discontinuation, dose reduction or corrective treatment, have been reported in the 
postmarketing setting. Patients, especially those with cardiac disease history, should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of heart failure.
Differentiation syndrome
Cases of differentiation syndrome (also known as retinoic acid syndrome) have been reported in 
patients receiving decitabine. Differentiation syndrome may be fatal (see section 4.8). Treatment with 
high-dose IV corticosteroids and haemodynamic monitoring should be considered at first onset of 
symptoms or signs suggestive of differentiation syndrome. Temporary discontinuation of Dacogen 
should be considered until resolution of symptoms and if resumed, caution is advised. 
Excipients
This medicine contains 0.5 mmol potassium per vial. After reconstitution and dilution of the solution 
for intravenous infusion, this medicine contains less than 1 mmol (39 mg) of potassium per dose, i.e. 
essentially ‘potassium- free’.
This medicine contains 0.29 mmol (6.67 mg) sodium per vial. After reconstitution and dilution of the 
solution for intravenous infusion, this medicine contains between 13.8 mg-138 mg (0.6-6 mmol)
sodium per dose (depending on the infusion fluid for dilution), equivalent to 0.7-7% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No formal clinical drug interaction studies with decitabine have been conducted.
There is the potential for a drug-drug interaction with other agents which are also activated by 
sequential phosphorylation (via intracellular phosphokinase activities) and/or metabolised by enzymes 
implicated in the inactivation of decitabine (e.g., cytidine deaminase). Therefore, caution should be 
exercised if these active substances are combined with decitabine.
4
Impact of co-administered medicinal products on decitabine
Cytochrome (CYP) 450-mediated metabolic interactions are not anticipated as decitabine metabolism 
is not mediated by this system but by oxidative deamination.
Impact of decitabine on co-administered medicinal products
Given its low in vitro plasma protein binding ( 1%), decitabine is unlikely to displace 
co-administered medicinal products from their plasma protein binding. Decitabine has been shown to 
be a weak inhibitor of P-gp mediated transport in vitro and is therefore, also not expected to affect 
P-gp mediated transport of co-administered medicinal products (see section 5.2).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in men and women
Due to the genotoxic potential of decitabine (see section 5.3), women of childbearing potential must
use effective contraceptive measures and avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with Dacogen
and for 6 months following completion of treatment. Men should use effective contraceptive measures 
and be advised to not father a child while receiving Dacogen, and for 3 months following completion 
of treatment (see section 5.3).
The use of decitabine with hormonal contraceptives has not been studied.
Pregnancy
There are no adequate data on the use of Dacogen in pregnant women. Studies have shown that 
decitabine is teratogenic in rats and mice (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Based on results from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Dacogen should not be used during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. A pregnancy test 
should be performed on all women of childbearing potential before treatment is started. If Dacogen is 
used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving this medicinal product, the 
patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether decitabine or its metabolites are excreted in breast milk. Dacogen is 
contraindicated during breast-feeding; therefore, if treatment with this medicine is required, 
breast-feeding must be discontinued (see section 4.3).
Fertility
No human data on the effect of decitabine on fertility are available. In non-clinical animal studies, 
decitabine alters male fertility and is mutagenic. Because of the possibility of infertility as a 
consequence of Dacogen therapy, men should seek advice on conservation of sperm and female 
patients of childbearing potential should seek consultation regarding oocyte cryopreservation prior to 
initiation of treatment.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Dacogen has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised 
that they may experience undesirable effects such as anaemia during treatment. Therefore, caution 
should be recommended when driving a car or operating machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 35%) reported are pyrexia, anaemia and 
thrombocytopaenia.
The most common Grade 3/4 adverse drug reactions (≥ 20%) included pneumonia, 
thrombocytopaenia, neutropaenia, febrile neutropaenia and anaemia.
5
In clinical studies, 30% of patients treated with Dacogen and 25% of patients treated in the comparator 
arm had adverse events with an outcome of death during treatment or within 30 days after the last dose 
of study drug.
In the Dacogen treatment group, there was a higher incidence of treatment discontinuation due to 
adverse events in women compared to men (43% versus 32%).
Tabulated list of adverse drug reactions
Adverse drug reactions reported in 293 AML patients treated with Dacogen are summarised in 
Table 1. The following table reflects data from AML clinical studies and from post-marketing 
experience. The adverse drug reactions are listed by frequency category. Frequency categories are 
defined as follows: Very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to

Description of selected adverse drug reactions
Haematologic adverse drug reactions
The most commonly reported haematologic adverse drug reactions associated with Dacogen treatment 
included febrile neutropaenia, thrombocytopaenia, neutropaenia, anaemia and leukopaenia.
Serious bleeding-related adverse drug reactions, some of which lead to a fatal outcome, such as central 
nervous system (CNS) haemorrhage (2%) and gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage (2%), in the context 
of severe thrombocytopaenia, were reported in patients receiving decitabine.
Haematological adverse drug reactions should be managed by routine monitoring of complete blood 
counts and early administration of supportive treatments as required. Supportive treatments include, 
administration of prophylactic antibiotics and/or growth factor support (e.g., G-CSF) for neutropaenia 
and transfusions for anaemia or thrombocytopaenia according to institutional guidelines. For situations 
where decitabine administration should be delayed, see section 4.2.
Infections and infestations adverse drug reactions
Serious infection-related adverse drug reactions, with potentially fatal outcome, such as septic shock, 
sepsis, pneumonia, and other infections (viral, bacterial and fungal) were reported in patients receiving 
decitabine.
Gastrointestinal disorders
Occurrences of enterocolitis, including neutropaenic colitis, caecitis have been reported during 
treatment with decitabine. Enterocolitis may lead to septic complications and may be associated with 
fatal outcome.
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders
Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pulmonary infiltrates, organising pneumonia and 
pulmonary fibrosis) without signs of infectious aetiology have been reported in patients receiving 
decitabine.
7
Differentiation syndrome
Cases of differentiation syndrome (also known as retinoic acid syndrome) have been reported in 
patients receiving decitabine. Differentiation syndrome may be fatal and symptoms and clinical 
findings include respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, fever, rash, pulmonary oedema, peripheral 
oedema, rapid weight gain, pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, hypotension and renal dysfunction.
Differentiation syndrome may occur with or without concomitant leucocytosis. Capillary leak 
syndrome and coagulopathy can also occur (see section 4.4).
Paediatric population
The safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on the limited safety data from a Phase I/II study 
to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of Dacogen in paediatric patients (aged 1 to 
14 years) with relapsed or refractory AML (n = 17) (see section 5.1). No new safety signal was 
observed in this paediatric study.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no direct experience of human overdose and no specific antidote. However, early clinical 
study data in published literature at doses greater than 20 times higher than the current therapeutic 
dose, reported increased myelosuppression including prolonged neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia. 
Toxicity is likely to manifest as exacerbations of adverse drug reactions, primarily myelosuppression.
Treatment for overdose should be supportive.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, pyrimidine analogues; ATC Code: 
L01BC08
Mechanism of action
Decitabine (5-aza-2-deoxycytidine) is a cytidine deoxynucleoside analogue that selectively inhibits 
DNA methyltransferases at low doses, resulting in gene promoter hypomethylation that can result in 
reactivation of tumour suppressor genes, induction of cellular differentiation or cellular senescence 
followed by programmed cell death.
Clinical experience
The use of Dacogen was studied in an open-label, randomised, multicentre Phase III study 
(DACO-016) in subjects with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML according to the WHO 
classification. Dacogen (n = 242) was compared to treatment choice (TC, n = 243) which consisted of 
patient’s choice with physician’s advice of either supportive care alone (n = 28, 11.5%) or 20 mg/m2
cytarabine subcutaneously once daily for 10 consecutive days repeated every 4 weeks 
(n = 215, 88.5%). Dacogen was administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 20 mg/m2 once daily 
for 5 consecutive days repeated every 4 weeks.
Subjects who were considered candidates for standard induction chemotherapy were not included in 
the study as shown by the following baseline characteristics. The median age for the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population was 73 years (range 64 to 91 years). Thirty-six percent of subjects had poor-risk
cytogenetics at baseline. The remainder of the subjects had intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Patients 
with favourable cytogenetics were not included in the study. Twenty-five percent of subjects had an 
ECOG performance status ≥ 2. Eighty-one percent of subjects had significant comorbidities (e.g., 
8
infection, cardiac impairment, pulmonary impairment). The number of patients treated with Dacogen
by racial group was White 209 (86.4%) and Asian 33 (13.6%).
The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. The secondary endpoint was complete 
remission rate that was assessed by independent expert review. Progression-free survival and 
Event-free survival were tertiary endpoints.
The median overall survival in the --ITT population was 7.7 months in subjects treated with Dacogen
compared to 5.0 months for subjects in the TC arm (hazard ratio 0.85; 95% CI: 0.69, 1.04, 
p = 0.1079). The difference did not reach statistical significance, however, there was a trend for 
improvement in survival with a 15% reduction in the risk of death for subjects in the Dacogen arm 
(Figure 1). When censored for potentially disease modifying subsequent therapy (i.e., induction 
chemotherapy or hypomethylating agent) the analysis for overall survival showed a 20% reduction in 
the risk of death for subjects in the Dacogen arm [HR = 0.80, (95% CI: 0.64, 0.99), 
p-value = 0.0437)].

Based on the initial analysis in the ITT population, a statistically significant difference in complete 
remission rate (CR + CRp) was achieved in favour of subjects in the Dacogen arm, 17.8% (43/242) 
compared to the TC arm, 7.8% (19/243); treatment difference 9.9% (95% CI: 4.07; 15.83), p = 0.0011. 
The median time to best response and median duration of best response in patients who achieved a CR 
or CRp were 4.3 months and 8.3 months, respectively. Progression-free survival was significantly 
longer for subjects in the Dacogen arm, 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.7, 4.6) compared with subjects in the 
TC arm, 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.9, 3.1); hazard ratio 0.75 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.91), p = 0.0031. These 
results as well as other endpoints are shown in Table 2.

Overall survival and complete remission rates in pre-specified disease-related sub-groups (i.e., 
cytogenetic risk, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score, age, type of AML, and baseline 
bone marrow blast count) were consistent with results for the overall study population.
The use of Dacogen as initial therapy was also evaluated in an open-label, single-arm, Phase II study 
(DACO-017) in 55 subjects > 60 years with AML according to the WHO classification. The primary 
endpoint was complete remission (CR) rate that was assessed by independent expert review. The 
secondary endpoint of the study was overall survival. Dacogen was administered as a 1-hour 
intravenous infusion of 20 mg/m2 once daily for 5 consecutive days repeated every 4 weeks. In the 
ITT analysis, a CR rate of 23.6% (95% CI: 13.2, 37) was observed in 13/55 subjects treated with 
Dacogen. The median time to CR was 4.1 months, and the median duration of CR was 18.2 months. 
The median overall survival in the ITT population was 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.7, 11.5).
The efficacy and safety of Dacogen has not been evaluated in patients with acute promyelocytic 
leukaemia or CNS leukaemia.
Paediatric population
A Phase I/II open-label, multicentre study evaluated the safety and efficacy of Dacogen in sequential 
administration with cytarabine in children aged 1 month to < 18 years with relapsed or refractory 
AML. A total of 17 subjects were enrolled and received Dacogen 20 mg/m2 in this study, of which 
9 subjects received cytarabine 1 g/m2 and 8 subjects received cytarabine administered at the maximum 
tolerable dose of 2 g/m2. All subjects discontinued the study treatment. The reasons for treatment 
discontinuation included disease progression (12 [70.6%] subjects), subjects proceeding to transplant 
(3 [17.6%]), investigator decision (1 [5.9%]), and “other” (1 [5.9%]). Reported adverse events were 
consistent with the known safety profile of Dacogen in adults (see section 4.8). Based on these 
negative results, Dacogen should not be used in children with AML aged < 18 years, because efficacy 
was not established (see section 4.2).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of decitabine were pooled from 3 clinical studies in 
45 patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) utilizing the 5-Day regimen. In each 
study, decitabine PK was evaluated on the fifth day of the first treatment cycle.
Distribution
The pharmacokinetics of decitabine following intravenous administration as a 1-hour infusion were
described by a linear two-compartment model, characterised by rapid elimination from the central 
compartment and by relatively slow distribution from the peripheral compartment. For a typical 
patient (weight 70 kg/body surface area 1.73 m2) the decitabine pharmacokinetic parameters are listed

Decitabine exhibits linear PK and following the intravenous infusion, steady-state concentrations are 
reached within 0.5 hour. Based on model simulation, PK parameters were independent of time (i.e., 
did not change from cycle to cycle) and no accumulation was observed with this dosing regimen. 
Plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (< 1%). Decitabine Vdss in cancer patients is large 
indicating distribution into peripheral tissues. There was no evidence of dependencies on age, 
creatinine clearance, total bilirubin, or disease.
Biotransformation
Intracellularly, decitabine is activated through sequential phosphorylation via phosphokinase activities 
to the corresponding triphosphate, which is then incorporated by the DNA polymerase. In vitro
metabolism data and the human mass balance study results indicated that the cytochrome P450 system 
is not involved in the metabolism of decitabine. The primary route of metabolism is likely through 
deamination by cytidine deaminase in the liver, kidney, intestinal epithelium and blood. Results from 
the human mass-balance study showed that unchanged decitabine in plasma accounted for 
approximately 2.4% of total radioactivity in plasma. The major circulating metabolites are not 
believed to be pharmacologically active. The presence of these metabolites in urine together with the 
high total body clearance and low urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine in the urine (~4% of the 
dose) indicate that decitabine is appreciably metabolised in vivo. In vitro studies show that decitabine 
does not inhibit nor induce CYP 450 enzymes up to more than 20-fold of the therapeutic maximum 
observed plasma concentration (Cmax). Thus; CYP-mediated metabolic drug interactions are not 
anticipated, and decitabine is unlikely to interact with agents metabolised through these pathways. In 
addition, in vitro data show that decitabine is a poor P-gp substrate.
Elimination
Mean plasma clearance following intravenous administration in cancer subjects was > 200 L/h with 
moderate inter-subject variability (coefficient of variation [CV] is approximately 50%). Excretion of 
unchanged drug appears to play only a minor role in the elimination of decitabine.
Results from a mass balance study with radioactive 14C-decitabine in cancer patients showed that 90% 
of the administered dose of decitabine (4% unchanged drug) is excreted in the urine.
Additional information on special populations
The effects of renal or hepatic impairment, gender, age or race on the pharmacokinetics of decitabine 
have not been formally studied. Information on special populations was derived from pharmacokinetic 
data from the 3 studies noted above, and from one Phase I study in MDS subjects, (N = 14; 
15 mg/m2 x 3-hours q8h x 3 days).
Elderly
Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that decitabine pharmacokinetics are not dependent on 
age (range studied 40 to 87 years; median 70 years).
Paediatric population
Population PK analysis of decitabine showed that after accounting for body size, there is no difference 
between decitabine PK parameters in paediatric AML patients versus adults with AML or MDS.
Gender
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of decitabine did not show any clinically relevant difference 
between men and women.
Race
Most of the patients studied were Caucasian. However, the population pharmacokinetic analysis of 
decitabine indicated that race had no apparent effect on the exposure to decitabine.
Hepatic impairment
The PK of decitabine have not been formally studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Results from 
a human mass-balance study and in vitro experiments mentioned above indicated that the CYP 
enzymes are unlikely to be involved in the metabolism of decitabine. In addition, the limited data from 
12
the population PK analysis indicated no significant PK parameter dependencies on total bilirubin 
concentration despite a wide range of total bilirubin levels. Thus, decitabine exposure is not likely to 
be affected in patients with impaired hepatic function.
Renal impairment
The PK of decitabine have not been formally studied in patients with renal insufficiency. The 
population PK analysis on the limited decitabine data indicated no significant PK parameter 
dependencies on normalised creatinine clearance, an indicator of renal function. Thus, decitabine 
exposure is not likely to be affected in patients with impaired renal function.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with decitabine. Evidence from the literature 
indicates that decitabine has carcinogenic potential. The available data from in vitro and in vivo studies 
provide sufficient evidence that decitabine has genotoxic potential. Data from the literature also 
indicate that decitabine has adverse effects on all aspects of the reproductive cycle, including fertility, 
embryo-foetal development and post-natal development. Multi-cycle repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
rats and rabbits indicated that the primary toxicity was myelosuppression, including effects on bone 
marrow, which was reversible on cessation of treatment. Gastrointestinal toxicity was also observed 
and in males, testicular atrophy which did not reverse over the scheduled recovery periods. Decitabine 
administration to neonatal/juvenile rats showed a comparable general toxicity profile as in older rats. 
Neurobehavioural development and reproductive capacity were unaffected when neonatal/juvenile rats 
were treated at dose levels inducing myelosuppression. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric 
use.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Dacogen is and what it is used for
What Dacogen is
Dacogen is an anti-cancer medicine. It contains the active substance ‘decitabine’.
What Dacogen is used for
Dacogen is used to treat a type of cancer called ‘acute myeloid leukaemia’ or ‘AML’. This is a type of 
cancer that affects your blood cells. You will be given Dacogen when you are first diagnosed with 
AML. It is used in adults.
How Dacogen works
Dacogen works by stopping cancer cells from growing. It also kills cancer cells.
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Dacogen works or why this 
medicine has been prescribed for you.
2. What you need to know before you are given Dacogen
Do not use Dacogen

if you are allergic to decitabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
if you are breast-feeding.

If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
using Dacogen.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dacogen if you have
low numbers of platelets, red blood cells or white blood cells,

an infection,

liver disease,

a serious kidney disorder,

a heart disorder.

23
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
using Dacogen.
Dacogen can cause a serious immune reaction called ‘differentiation syndrome’ (see section 4 
‘Possible side effects’).
Tests or checks
You will have blood tests before you start treatment with Dacogen and at the start of each treatment 
cycle. These tests are to check that:


Talk to your doctor about what your blood test results mean.
you have enough blood cells, and
your liver and kidneys are working properly.
Children and adolescents
Dacogen is not for use in children or adolescents under the age of 18.
Other medicines and Dacogen
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is 
because Dacogen can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can 
affect the way Dacogen works.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine.
You should not use Dacogen if you are pregnant as it may harm your baby. If you are able to 
become pregnant, your doctor will ask you to take a pregnancy test before you start treatment 
with Dacogen. Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant during treatment with 
Dacogen.
Do not breast-feed if you are using Dacogen. This is because it is not known if the medicine
passes into the mother’s milk.
Male and female fertility and contraception


Men should not father a child while using Dacogen.
Men should use effective contraception during treatment and for up to 3 months after treatment 
has stopped.
Talk to your doctor if you wish to conserve your sperm before starting treatment.
Women who are able to become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment and 
for 6 months following completion of treatment.
Talk to your doctor if you wish to freeze your eggs before starting treatment.
Driving and using machines
You may feel tired or weak after using Dacogen. If this happens, do not drive or use any tools or 
machines.
Dacogen contains potassium and sodium

This medicine contains 0.5 mmol potassium in each vial. After preparing the medicine, it
contains less than 1 mmol (39 mg) of potassium per dose, i.e. essentially ‘potassium- free’.
This medicine contains 0.29 mmol (6.67 mg) sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 
each vial. After preparing the medicine, it contains between 13.8 mg-138 mg sodium per dose, 
equivalent to 0.7-7% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.
Talk to your doctor if you are on a low salt diet.

How to use Dacogen
Dacogen will be given to you by a doctor or nurse who is trained in giving this type of medicine.
How much to use

Your doctor will work out your dose of Dacogen. This depends on your height and weight 
(body surface area).
The dose is 20 mg/m2 body surface area.
You will receive Dacogen every day for 5 days, then 3 weeks without the medicine. This is 
called a ‘treatment cycle’ and it is repeated every 4 weeks. You will usually receive at least 
4 treatment cycles.
Your doctor may delay your dose and change the total number of cycles, depending on how you 
respond to the treatment.



How Dacogen is given
The solution is given into a vein (as an infusion). This will take one hour.
If you are given more Dacogen than you should
This medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the unlikely event that you are given too much
(an overdose) your doctor will check you for side effects and manage them accordingly.
If you forget your appointment to have Dacogen
If you miss an appointment, make another one as soon as possible. This is because for this medicine to 
be as effective as possible, it is important to follow the dosing schedule.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.
4.
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The 
following side effects may happen with this medicine.
Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you notice any of the following serious side effects

Fever: this may be a sign of an infection caused by low levels of white blood cells (very 
common).

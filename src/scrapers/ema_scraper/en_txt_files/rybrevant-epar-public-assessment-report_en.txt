2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant is seeking a Marketing Authorisation for the treatment of adult patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) Exon 20 insertion mutations, after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The inclusion criteria of the pivotal study required histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC that 
was metastatic or unresectable. Thus, the term locally advanced is used in the meaning unresectable.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Advanced NSCLC is a serious, almost invariably terminal illness. As the leading cause of cancer-related 
mortality, lung cancer is a major global health concern, with 228,000 new diagnoses annually in the 
United States, 490,000 in the European Union, and slightly over 1 million in Asia, with the highest 
reported incidence rates in Korea and China (SEER 2020a, Bray 2018, Pakzad 2015). NSCLC accounts 
for 85% to 90% of lung cancers (Globocan 2012), with 5 year survival rates for NSCLC depending 
upon on the stage at diagnosis, ranging from 58.7% for localized cancer to 4.7% for cancer that has 
spread to distant locations (SEER 2020b).  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Recent developments include the identification of populations of NSCLC patients with “driver 
mutations” that result in constitutive activation of pro-growth signalling pathways. The most prevalent 
of these are mutations affecting EGFR in approximately 15% of Western patients with NSCLC 
adenocarcinoma (Pao 2011), and in up to 40% to 50% of Asian patients with NSCLC adenocarcinoma 
(Jänne 2006). The most commonly occurring EGFR mutations, L858R and Exon 19del, are sensitive to 
approved EGFR TKIs, and the use of these targeted agents in the front-line therapy of these patients 
has been associated with improved response rates and duration of disease control, leading to 
dramatically increased median OS of 32 to 39 months (Ramalingam 2020). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 9/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In up to 10% of EGFR-mutated NSCLC, however, EGFR is activated through one of a group of 
heterogenous, in-frame base pair insertions in EGFR Exon 20, collectively referred to as EGFR Exon 
20ins (Vyse 2019). The unique protein structure associated with this group of EGFR mutations 
prevents effective binding by approved EGFR TKIs. Tumours arising from EGFR Exon 20ins, therefore, 
are associated with primary resistance to currently approved EGFR TKIs, and these patients have 
correspondingly not benefitted from the significantly improved clinical outcomes associated with these 
agents in their target populations. As a result, patients with EGFR Exon 20ins NSCLC, despite having 
tumours with well-understood tumour biology, do not currently benefit from targeted therapy, and 
they remain a population with significant unmet medical need. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Lung cancer is often insidious, producing no symptoms until the disease is well advanced. In 
approximately 7-10% of cases, lung cancer is diagnosed in asymptomatic patients when a chest 
radiograph performed for other reasons reveals the disease. At initial diagnosis, 20% of patients have 
localized disease, 25% of patients have regional metastasis, and 55% of patients have distant spread 
of disease (Tan 2021). 
Signs and symptoms of lung cancers may be due to the primary tumour, locoregional spread, 
metastatic disease, or ectopic hormone production. Cough is reported to be the most common 
presenting symptom of lung cancer. Other respiratory symptoms include dyspnoea, chest pain, and 
haemoptysis (Tan 2021). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Several EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib, dacomitinib, and osimertinib, have been approved for use in the 
front-line therapy of NSCLC based on Phase 3 studies that exclusively enrolled patients with EGFR Exon 
19del and L858R mutations. These studies have resulted in significantly improved patient outcomes, 
with improved response rates, prolonged disease control, and an improved median OS of 32 to 39 
months (Ramalingam 2020). 
In contrast to EGFR L858R or Exon 19del disease, tumours arising from EGFR Exon 20ins are known to 
be insensitive to currently approved EGFR TKI treatments. As a result, there are no approved therapies 
specifically for the treatment of patients with Exon 20ins disease and no specific treatment guidelines 
are given by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) or the European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO) for treatment of this population.  
In the absence of effective targeted therapies, the current standard of care for newly diagnosed 
patients with EGFR Exon 20ins NSCLC remains platinum-based chemotherapy (Wu 2019). Although the 
platinum-based chemotherapy regimen has not been extensively studied prospectively in EGFR Exon 
20ins disease, the similar underlying biology and available evidence from retrospective studies suggest 
equivalent efficacy to patients with TKI-sensitive EGFR-mutant NSCLC, with an approximate ORR of 
30% and median PFS of approximately 4 months (Mok 2017, Wu 2019). 
As patients with EGFR Exon 20ins NSCLC have been excluded from the majority of Phase 3 studies of 
EGFR TKIs, this population has been relatively understudied in clinical studies, and published reports 
often have been based on retrospective analyses or case series/reports. Available evidence 
demonstrates that after progression on platinum-based chemotherapy, there is no predominant 
standard of care for EGFR Exon 20ins NSCLC. Single-agent chemotherapy is commonly used in NSCLC 
patients but is associated with relatively low ORR (8%-12%) and median PFS (2 3 months) in 
randomized Phase 3 studies (Borghaei 2015, Hanna 2004). These agents can be associated with 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 10/144 
 
 
 
 
 
toxicities such as anaemia, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or peripheral neuropathy, all of 
which may prevent patients from deriving clinical benefit due to dose modification and/or interruption 
and additionally may detrimentally impact patient well being and health-related quality of life, with 
little associated clinical benefit. 
Single-agent immunotherapy with agents inhibiting programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) or its 
ligand (anti-PD-L1), have also been approved for use in NSCLC in the second-line setting. However, 
these agents have repeatedly demonstrated worse PFS and OS outcomes than single agent docetaxel 
and platinum-based chemotherapy in subjects with EGFR mutated disease, as compared with EGFR 
wild-type disease (Borghaei 2015, Herbst 2016, Rittmeyer 2017). As a result, patients with EGFR-
mutated NSCLC have been excluded from frontline immunotherapy Phase 3 studies, and the resulting 
frontline indications for approved anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 agents in metastatic NSCLC have specifically 
excluded patients with EGFR-mutated disease, including patients with EGFR Exon 20ins (Opdivo 
Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC] 2020, Tecentriq SmPC 2020). 
The combination of ramucirumab and docetaxel has been more recently approved for use in second-
line treatment of NSCLC, based upon a 1.5-month improvement in median PFS (4.5 vs 3.0 months) 
and a 1.4-month improvement in median OS (10.5 vs 9.1 months), as compared with docetaxel alone. 
The combination was also associated with an improved ORR of 23% versus 14% in the docetaxel alone 
arm (Garon 2014). However, a subsequent analysis of ORR by prespecified histological subgroups 
demonstrated that subjects with adenocarcinoma treated with the ramucirumab and docetaxel 
combination (n=377) had a non-significant increase in ORR of 18.6% vs 15.2% in the docetaxel alone 
arm (n=348) (Paz-Ares 2017). Subjects in the ramucirumab and docetaxel group, however, 
experienced higher rates of stomatitis (23% vs 13%), bleeding or haemorrhage (29% vs 15%), 
hypertension (11% vs 5%), and peripheral oedema (16% vs 8%) compared with subjects in the 
docetaxel alone arm (Garon 2014).  
Nintedanib in combination with docetaxel has also been approved in the European Union in patients 
who have received any prior chemotherapy based on a modest improvement of 1.2 months PFS over 
treatment with docetaxel (4.0 months vs 2.8 months) and an objective response rate of 4.7% versus 
3.6% (Nintedanib SmPC 2020). However, in the 1199.13 pivotal study, treatment with the nintedanib 
and docetaxel combination was associated with a reported overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) 
leading to discontinuation of 22.7% of subjects (nintedanib EPAR: 002569/0000). Subjects in the 
nintedanib and docetaxel group experienced higher rates of hepatic failure, non-gastrointestinal 
perforations, and neutropenia. The rates of sepsis (1.3%) and febrile neutropenia (7.5%) were 
increased under treatment with nintedanib and docetaxel as compared to docetaxel alone. The most 
commonly observed Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were liver enzymes elevations, decreased white blood 
cells and neutrophils, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, and neutropenia. Analysis of the Ipsos Healthcare 
database using European EHRs identified that despite approval of the nintedanib and docetaxel 
combination, there is limited utilization in the European Union. 
In summary, these data outline the lack of benefit in patients with EGFR Exon 20ins despite recent 
advancements in treatment of NSCLC. Although EGFR TKIs have significantly improved outcomes in 
patients with EGFR Exon 19del or L858R mutations, patients with EGFR Exon 20ins NSCLC have not 
benefitted, despite the similar underlying biology of their tumours. With no effective targeted therapies 
and demonstrated low responses to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents, patients with EGFR Exon 20ins NSCLC 
have limited treatment options and overall outcomes remain very poor. Recently published real-world 
data (RWD) analyses of Exon 20ins disease treatments have confirmed the relatively poor outcomes in 
both first-line and second-line settings with TKI, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy (median duration 
of treatment of 3.5 months), and a reported median OS of 16.2 months (Dersarkissian 2019).

New targeted therapies, therefore, are needed to provide effective EGFR inhibition in patients with 
Exon 20ins, specifically in patients who have not benefitted from platinum-based chemotherapy, for 
whom there is no standard of care, and who represent a population with unmet medical need.

2.2.  About the product 
Rybrevant (amivantamab) is an EGFR and MET receptor bispecific antibody. The pharmacotherapeutic 
group was not yet assigned. Three potential mechanisms of action for amivantamab to inhibit tumours 
with aberrant EGFR and MET signalling are proposed: 1) inhibition of ligand-dependent signalling, 2) 
downregulation of EGFR and MET levels from cell surface, and 3) initiation of antibody-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or antibody-dependent cellular trogocytosis (ADCT) mechanisms. 
The proposed dose is 1050 mg for patients <80 kg body weight (at baseline) or 1400 mg for patients 
≥80 kg body weight (at baseline), administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion once weekly for 4 
weeks, then every 2 weeks thereafter. The first Cycle 1 dose is split over 2 days with the first infusion 
of 350 mg on Day 1 and 700 mg (body weight <80 kg) or 1050 mg (body weight ≥80 kg) on Day 2. 
The CHMP adopted a positive opinion for use of Rybrevant in the following indication: 
Rybrevant as monotherapy is indicated for treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon 20 insertion 
mutations, after failure of platinum-based therapy. 
Treatment with Rybrevant should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
Rybrevant should be administered by a healthcare professional with access to appropriate medical 
support to manage infusion-related reactions (IRRs) if they occur. 
Before initiation of Rybrevant therapy, EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutation-positive status must be 
established using a validated test method.  
Posology 
Premedications should be administered to reduce the risk of IRRs with Rybrevant (see below 
“Recommended concomitant medicinal products”). 
The recommended dose of Rybrevant is provided in Table 1, and the dosing schedule is provided in

2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the uncontrolled design of the 
pivotal trial and the uncertainties on the impact of amivantamab on PFS. 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 13/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accordance with Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, based on the following criteria: 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
Amivantamab is a new and novel targeted agent for the treatment of subjects with NSCLC and EGFR 
Exon 20ins mutations. The initial MAA is based on data from a Phase 1 single arm study EDI1001. The 
current efficacy and safety, albeit with the limitations of a single-arm study, demonstrates that 
amivantamab delivers a substantially increased clinical benefit over available therapies for EGFR Exon 
20ins patients. The observed efficacy demonstrates significant benefit in a patient population that has 
no standard of care after the failure of platinum-based chemotherapy and has not benefitted from 
targeted therapy and immunotherapy. A favourable safety profile has been demonstrated, with 
clinically manageable side effects. 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
The ongoing Phase 3 study (Study 61186372NSC3001) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of the 
combination of amivantamab and carboplatin-pemetrexed chemotherapy as compared with 
carboplatin-pemetrexed chemotherapy alone, in the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR Exon 
20ins NSCLC and will be used to fulfil specific obligations associated with a conditional authorization.  
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed.  
NSCLC with EGFR Exon 20ins is distinguished by de novo resistance to currently approved EGFR TKIs, 
including third generation TKIs such as osimertinib. Whereas the median OS for patients with common 
EGFR mutations has increased to 38.6 months with the introduction of osimertinib as a first line 
treatment for locally advanced or metastatic patients, this has not translated to a benefit for patients 
with Exon 20ins mutations and whose median OS is still limited to approximately 16 months at the 
same stage of the disease. Amivantamab is anticipated to address a major public health interest by 
providing an effective treatment option for patients with NSCLC and Exon 20ins mutations, who have 
failed platinum-based chemotherapy. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. 
The Company considers a delay to gather this comparative data would be disproportionate from a 
public health perspective, as amivantamab addresses a major unmet medical need, which outweighs 
the risks due to the need for further data. Amivantamab is distinct from approved agents for EGFR-
mutated NSCLC and delivers a major therapeutic innovation as a first in class EGFR/MET bispecific Ab. 
The robust and durable anti-tumour activity of amivantamab observed in subjects with EGFR Exon 
20ins NSCLC after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy provides a benefit for this distinct molecular 
subtype of the disease that clearly has poorer prognosis and worse treatment outcomes compared with 
patients without these aberrations. The overall safety profile of amivantamab is favourable, and 
treatment is expected to prolong PFS and OS without introducing significant new toxicities or risks for 
patients with Exon 20ins mutations. Once approved, amivantamab is expected to rapidly emerge as a 
standard of care for the treatment of Exon 20 ins mutation NSCLC after the failure of platinum-based 
chemotherapy. Amivantamab will be a highly valued treatment option for clinicians and would be 
utilized despite the fact that no comparative Phase 3 data are available.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Amivantamab, the active substance contained in Rybrevant, is a fully human Immunoglobulin G1 
(IgG1) based bispecific antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and 
mesenchymal epidermal transition receptor (MET), produced by a mammalian cell line (Chinese 
Hamster Ovary [CHO]) using recombinant DNA technology. 
Rybrevant is presented as a concentrate for solution for infusion in a Type I glass vial containing 350 
mg of amivantamab in 7 mL (strength 350 mg). The pack size contains one vial. 
Amivantamab is formulated with the following compendial excipients: L-histidine, L-histidine 
hydrochloride monohydrate, sucrose, polysorbate 80, L-methionine, EDTA disodium salt dihydrate and 
water for injections.  
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Amivantamab is a fully human low-fucose IgG1 bispecific antibody that binds to the extracellular 
domains of EGF and MET receptors and disrupts EGFR and MET signalling functions through blocking 
ligand binding and enhancing degradation of EGFR and MET, thereby preventing tumour growth and 
progression. The presence of EGFR and MET on the surface of tumour cells also allows for targeting of 
these cells for destruction by immune effector cells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages, 
through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and trogocytosis mechanisms, respectively. 
Amivantamab consists of 2 heavy chains (HC) and 2 light chains (LC) which are linked together via 
non-covalent heavy-heavy and heavy-light interactions, as well as covalent heavy-heavy and heavy-
light disulfide bonds. Disulfide bond pairings have been determined experimentally by peptide mapping 
and follow the expected topology for a human IgG1 antibody. 
Amivantamab is produced by cultivation of recombinant CHO cells and has a molecular mass of 148209 
Da for the major glycoform. It is prepared by controlled reduction and oxidation of the parental JNJ-
55986736 (also referred to as CNTO 4005 or anti-EGFR) and JNJ-55944083 (also referred to as CNTO 
9541 or anti-MET) monospecific antibodies (MAbs) resulting in an exchange of the Fab arms. The Fab 
arm exchange is facilitated by amino acid substitutions in the CH3 domains at positions K411R of the 
parental JNJ-55944083 HC and F413L of the parental JNJ-55986736 HC, to enable preferential 
refolding of the heterodimer. 
The information in this section is considered sufficient. No concerns are raised.

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process of amivantamab active substance encompasses the manufacture of two 
separate parental MAb intermediates (concentrated protein A eluates), a Fab arm exchange to produce 
the bispecific antibody, further purification steps, formulation, and filtration to active substance fill. 
The two parental MAb intermediates are manufactured at Biogen Inc., 5000 Davis Drive, Research 
Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA (Stages 1 to 5). Amivantamab active substance is manufactured by 
Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, Barnahely, Ringaskiddy, Co. Cork, Ireland (JSI) (Stages 6 to 14). 
Manufacturing operations, including release and stability testing, are performed in house at Janssen, 
and by contract manufacturers. The name, address, and responsibilities of each manufacturer involved 
in the manufacture, storage, and testing of the intermediates and the active substance is available in 
the dossier. Appropriate GMP certification and manufacturing authorisations are provided.  
For each parental MAb concentrated protein A eluate, the manufacturing process encompasses cell 
culture, harvest, capture, concentration and filling into bottles. Maximum time in the preculture seed 
train and maximum production bioreactor duration are identified. Harvest samples are tested for 
adventitious agents (viruses, bioburden, and mycoplasma) and IgG concentration. The intermediates 
are.  
The manufacturing process of the bispecific antibody encompass thawing and mixture of the two 
parental MAbs, reduction and oxidation to enable Fab arm exchange, purification by chromatography 
steps, viral inactivation and virus filtration, formulation, and 0.2 um filtration to final fill.  
The manufacturing process and process controls are summarised in flow charts and process 
parameters are tabulated, including limits and criticality assignments. Limits for in-process controls 
(IPCs) are provided. The purpose of each step is clearly stated, and a detailed description is provided. 
Operating sequences, resin and filter materials, buffers, flow rates, transmembrane pressure, 
membrane cut-off, and collection of fractions are provided for the chromatography steps and the 
filtration steps. Representative chromatograms are provided for each chromatography step and the 
scale of the columns are provided. The level of detail is considered sufficient. 
All media used for the cell culture process are chemically defined and free of animal-derived 
components. In-process pool hold times and hold conditions are sufficiently described for each step.  
Reprocessing is allowed and described in sufficient detail and supported by validation data (see below). 
In summary, the description of the proposed manufacturing processes (parental MAbs and active 
substance) is acceptable. 
Control of materials 
Detailed descriptions of raw materials and consumables such as resins, filters, and single-use bags are 
presented. Specifications with acceptance criteria and short descriptions of test methods are provided 
for non-compendial raw materials. Animal-derived and human-derived components were used during 
cell development. No animal-derived or human-derived material was used during manufacture of the 
master cell banks (MCBs) and the WCBs, and no such material is used during manufacture of the 
active substance. The information regarding raw material is considered sufficient. 
The two parental MAbs are expressed in a variant adapted to growth in chemically defined media and 
subjected to selection to enable expression of low-fucose recombinant proteins. The human sequences 
for anti-EGFR and anti-MET, respectively, originates from hybridoma technology (mice were immunised 
with a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line + soluble human EGFR, or CHO-S cells expressing human 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021

MET). The information regarding the host cell and the origin of the nucleotide sequences coding for the 
two parental antibodies have been sufficiently described.  
A sequence variant (due to a point mutation) was detected in the anti-MET LC. It exists in the MCB, 
the WCB and the end-of-production cell bank (EPCB) at levels close to the limit of detection. Based on 
the totality of information regarding the sequence variant throughout the dossier, it is considered well 
controlled at low levels. This is acceptable. 
The MCBs and WCBs were manufactured and tested according to ICH Q5A, Q5B and Q5D guidelines. 
The analytical test package is extensive, and the virus testing is sufficiently justified by detailed 
description of cell line development history. Certificate of analysis are provided for both MCBs and both 
WCBs and further test results regarding identity testing, sequencing, and cell bank stability testing are 
provided.  
The cell banks are stored in vapour phase over liquid nitrogen. This is supported. 
WCB vials are shipped to the Biogen site on an as needed basis and stored in validated cryogenic 
freezers in the vapour phase over liquid nitrogen.  
The limit of in vitro cell age was evaluated by manufacture and testing of an extended end of 
production cell bank for each parental MAb. Cells were withdrawn in the production bioreactor, and 
further cultivated beyond the normal total manufacturing time. This is considered appropriate as it is 
shown that there is no additional cell growth in the production bioreactor . The test package and the 
results, including testing for viruses, support sufficient stability through the length of the proposed cell 
cultivation process. 
Preparation of future WCBs is sufficiently described and protocols are included. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Process parameters were categorised as non-critical (non-CPPs) and critical (CPPs) by assessing their 
impact on critical quality attributes (CQAs). The CPPs are a subset of process parameters that have the 
greatest potential to influence CQAs. Based on information in 3.2.S.2.6, a proven acceptable range 
(PAR) is defined as in ICH Q8. According to the descriptions for CPPs (3.2.S.2.2) and CQAs (3.2.P.2.3), 
it can be concluded that these terms also are defined in line with ICH Q8.  
IPCs, including microbial controls (bioburden, endotoxin, mycoplasma, in vitro adventitious virus), and 
limits are presented in a condensed format. Justifications are provided for the IPCs in the parental MAb 
intermediates and active substance manufacturing processes.  
All manufacturing process stages during the production of the parental MAb intermediates and 
amivantamab active substance are considered equally critical. IPCs can have one of three different 
types of limits: acceptance criterion, action limit, or pre-defined instruction. An action limit is a 
condition that, when exceeded, requires immediate response, investigation and correction. Exceeded 
acceptance criteria will also be investigated before decision regarding batch disposition. Specifically, if 
the acceptance criteria for mycoplasma or in vitro adventitious virus testing are exceeded, and the out-
of-specification result is confirmed after investigation, the failed batch will be rejected. The Applicant 
states that an excursion from a CPP or non-CPP PAR triggers a deviation and results in an investigation 
and impact assessment which must be resolved prior to batch release. This is acceptable. The 
assignment of the limit types to the IPCs is supported.  
The Applicant states that this list of IPCs and the associated acceptance criteria, action limits, and 
predefined instructions may evolve as the level of process understanding increases during the 
product’s lifecycle. This is expected as part of process lifecycle management. As a general comment, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 17/144 
 
 
 
 
 
the Applicant is reminded that a change to a process parameter listed in section 3.2.S.2.2 or a change 
to an IPC listed in 3.2.S.2.4 should be subject to a variation application.  
Intermediate specifications 
The specifications for concentrated protein A eluates for both parental MAb intermediates include tests 
for general characteristics (pH-Ph. Eur), identity (Dot blot), quantity (A280), charge heterogeneity 
(cIEF), purity (SE-HPLC), reduced cSDS, non-reduced cSDS) and microbial contaminants 
(bioburden/endotoxins Ph. Eur.).  
Justification of specifications for the parental MAb intermediates (concentrated protein A eluates) 
Justifications are provided and the proposed commercial parental MAb specifications are considered 
acceptable. The specifications were derived from compendial guidelines, product and process 
knowledge, prior experience with other MAb products, and statistical analysis of release and stability 
data primarily from a clinical subset of batches. Parts of the overall strategy to set specifications are 
supported. A clear explanation is provided regarding the batches used for the clinical trial.   
The Applicant proposes to set acceptance criteria for the parental MAbs separately from active 
substance and finished product since amivantamab is a bispecific molecule and different to the parental 
MAbs. Many attributes of the bispecific molecule are derived from the attributes of the parental MAbs. 
Thus, the link from the finished product specification to the active substance specification is considered 
to continue also to the parental MAb intermediate specifications, at least for some attributes. 
Data from structure-function studies and other characterisation studies support the proposed 
acceptance criteria which are considered approvable. The proposed limits for quantity are rather wide 
but still considered acceptable as the starting point for manufacture of the bispecific antibody is based 
on a weight ratio of anti-EGFR to anti-MET. 
Intermediate batch analysis 
Batch release results for concentrated protein A eluate intermediate lots are provided. The data is 
presented without the specifications in place at the time for manufacture, however historical 
specifications are provided. This is acceptable. 
For the anti-EGFR parental MAb (JNJ-55986736) concentrated protein A eluate, batch analyses  are 
provided in the dossier. 
For the anti-MET parental MAb (JNJ-55944083) concentrated protein A eluate, batch analyses  are 
provided in the dossier. 
The release data is consistent for most attributes through all batches for the respective intermediates. 
It is noted that there is a difference, although the results fall within the currently proposed 
intermediate specifications.  
The submitted intermediate batch data from the different process versions could be concluded to 
support a consistent manufacture of both intermediates. 
Overall, the proposed controls of critical steps and intermediates are considered acceptable. 
Process validation 
An extensive set of studies for process validation is presented, along with descriptions of methods and 
tools. Four consecutive batches each for the parental MAb intermediates, and five consecutive batches 
of active substance were included. The parental MAb intermediate batches were started from a single 
WCB vial each. For two of the five active substance process validation batches, parental MAb 
intermediate material from more than one batch was included.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 18/144 
 
 
 
 
 
The process validation of the manufacturing steps  for active substance is adequately described and 
reported.  
Process validation commercial scale results are scattered throughout the dossier; however clear cross-
references are given: the approach and results from CPPs/non-CPPs and selected IPCs are available in 
S.2.5. Process validation release results for the parental MAb intermediates are available in 3.2.S.2.4. 
Process validation release results for the active substance are available in 3.2.S.4.4 and the 
acceptance criteria in 3.2.S.4.1. 
Except for a few deviations, the results for parameters, IPCs (the select group with acceptance criteria 
only, because batch data for IPCs with action limits and predetermined actions are available in 
3.2.S.2.6) and attributes for the parental MAbs and active substance are well aligned within rather 
narrow intervals. The deviations were acceptably investigated and handled. 
During commercial scale  process validation, extended sampling and testing were performed beyond 
routine release and in-process testing. Such samples were used for further characterisation according 
to a predetermined protocol without acceptance criteria. This approach is endorsed, and it is agreed 
that the results support consistent parental MAb intermediate and active substance quality and process 
performance. 
The approach to demonstrate clearance of impurities is endorsed (reduced-scale spiking studies and 
clearance data from commercial scale process validation batches). The criticality of impurities is further 
discussed and assessed in the manufacturing development section. It is agreed that residual amounts 
do not have to be included batch testing for routine manufacture. Although commercial scale process 
validation data and reduced-scale spiking data demonstrates consistent low levels , this is a relevant 
safety attribute and is therefore included in the active substance specification. 
Information provided regarding extractables and leachables is considered sufficient. The extractable 
risk assessment strategy and the performed studies are supported. Details are provided in technical 
reports. Based on the information provided, it is agreed that the use of the specified polymeric product 
contact materials for the manufacturing process poses minimal risk to patient safety. 
The hold times study approach for biochemical and microbial stability is considered acceptable (scale, 
containers/vessels, sampling, test panel). Thus, the biochemical hold times and hold conditions can be 
considered validated.  
Small-scale data support the proposed reuse of chromatography resins and UFDF membranes. 
Continued verification of resin lifetime limits is performed during commercial manufacturing by testing 
for certain attributes (including microbial controls) at regular intervals, as detailed in the dossier. The 
strategy seems approvable. The ultrafiltration membrane lifetime verification program for the JSI site  
can also be considered suitable. 
A potential need for reprocessing is foreseen. Reprocessing for each of these stages will also be 
verified at the commercial scale on the first batch that requires reprocessing. Validation protocols were 
submitted. The protocols contain information regarding the circumstances for execution, the testing 
and the acceptance criteria. The content and the level of detail is considered approvable. 
It is clearly stated that reprocessing may be performed once and must be completed within the hold 
times specified for the step. This is acknowledged. 
Analytical methods used during process validation studies were validated as appropriate for intended 
use. The analytical method validations are provided. The level of information is considered sufficient, 
no concerns are raised. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 19/144 
 
 
 
 
 
The information provided regarding shipping validation is sufficient. Furthermore, a strategy for 
alternate shipping systems, suppliers or methods is presented with the goal to ensure that any 
alternate systems meet the same requirements for quality and protection as the current systems. It is 
stated that the health authority will be notified of any changes in insulated shipping as appropriate. 
The presented strategy for introduction of alternate shipping systems seems scientifically sound. The 
Applicant is reminded that future changes to the registered shipping system should be subject to 
variation.  
The outlined ongoing process verification program (trending and analysis to ensure that the process 
remains in its validated state) is endorsed. 
Overall, it is agreed that the results support the conclusion that the commercial manufacturing 
processes for parental MAb intermediates and active substance can be considered validated. 
Manufacturing process development 
Process development history 
Three different versions of the active substance manufacturing process have been used during clinical 
development:. The changes between the process versions are clearly outlined and comparability 
studies are submitted. One batch was used in the clinical trial included with this submission.  
For active substance, the major changes were manufacturing site for the parental MAbs, scale, 
cultivation media and feeds, pH and parental MAb ratio for the Fab arm exchange step, protein A resin, 
hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) resin, virus filter, and formulation. The major changes 
were scale (all steps) and cultivation valine supplementation (anti-Met parental MAb). 
An extensive number of active substance batches is available for all scales; however not all of them 
were included in the comparability study. 
QbD elements such as risk assessments and designs of experiments (DoE) were included during 
process development; however the proposed active substance manufacturing process does not contain 
any multivariate elements of process control. 
Process development studies and reduced-scale model qualification 
An extensive process development program is submitted, including justifications for all stages of the 
proposed active substance manufacturing process which consists of a traditional set of PARs, and in 
some cases operational ranges (ORs) (a minimal level of variation around the target setpoint).  
Univariate and multivariate development studies were performed to identify PARs for process 
parameters. For multivariate/DoE studies, model designs are described, statistical significance 
evaluated (p-values are mentioned in the narrative), and practical significance/insignificance 
concluded. The strategy is supported, and the outcome is considered appropriate. The evaluated 
ranges are not wide (PARs are in many cases close to or equal the evaluated range) and the variations 
in attribute levels are small.  
The reduced scale models (RSM) used for many development studies were appropriately qualified. The 
approach and conclusions are supported and it is agreed that the RSMs can be considered qualified. 
The approach to the impurity criticality evaluation, encompassing process related impurities, is 
considered scientifically sound. The summary of results and the conclusions are supported. In the end, 
no process-related impurities were identified as CQAs. 
In summary, the process development program is considered appropriate and supportive of the 
proposed manufacturing process. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 20/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Process control strategy development 
Consistent process performance and control of the CQAs are managed by an integrated control 
strategy encompassing release specifications for raw materials and consumables, CPP limits, in-process 
testing, and release and stability specifications for intermediates and active substance. This is 
supported. The integrated control of each CQA is also described in sufficient detail. 
CPPs are identified by an initial evaluation of presumptive process parameters followed by process 
development studies. Observed or assumed impact levels are combined with the degree of knowledge 
uncertainty to give the final criticality assignment: CPP, non-CPP or potential CPP (pCPPs). Parameters 
still identified as pCPPs will require further investigation but is currently controlled as CPPs. This is 
endorsed. The Applicant is reminded that changes to the registered CPPs will require a post-approval 
variation application. The overall approach to CPP identification is supported and the presentation with 
criticality summary tables for each step is appreciated. The proposed process parameter criticality 
assignment is approvable. 
The microbial control strategies at Biogen (parental MAbs) and JSI (active substance) are described in 
detail. Preparation and control to minimise risks for microbial contamination of facilities, equipment, 
and materials are considered sufficient. 
Comparability 
Comparability for both active substance and finished product is described in section 3.2.S.2.6. Three 
different comparability studies are presented:  
The comparability studies encompass comparison to the clinical release specifications, characterisation 
testing, stability studies, forced degradation rates (temperature, light).  
The aspects considered and the panel of tests included in the comparability exercise are considered 
sufficient and in compliance with ICH Q5E. Individual batch results are presented in tables, 
chromatograms, electropherograms, and spectra (sufficient resolution and peaks identified), and 
conclusions are clearly stated.  
Release testing did meet clinical specification criteria, but the fact that process versions fulfil 
specifications does not automatically render them comparable, as potential trends within ranges are 
not evaluated and clinical specifications tend to be rather generous. Comparability limits are presented 
as mean ± 3 standard deviations or prediction intervals, which is a measure of process capability 
rather than of comparability.  The statistical models as such were described in the original application 
but the use in the comparability exercise is not sufficiently justified. Therefore, the assessment of the 
comparability studies is based on post-change results in relation to the historical pre-change min-max 
intervals. 
Based on the results from study 1, it is agreed that the finished product derived from the pre-clinical 
toxicology and clinical processes can be considered comparable. 
For study 2, it can be concluded that there are obvious shifts in active substance and finished product. 
In comparison of the single post-change batch to other batches in S.4.4 (Batch analyses), these 
changes seem consistent over the  range.  
are considered acceptable and part of the targeted improvement and optimisation of the 2000 L 
process. It is also agreed that for the  batch tested, binding to receptors is highly similar, thus the 
biological function seems comparable. 
For study 3, it can be concluded that there are obvious shifts in active substance and finished product.

The Applicant states that the would not impact safety based on the dose used in the toxicology study. 
The relevance of the toxicity study to the safety in humans is considered limited, as already discussed 
during the procedure. However, it is agreed that could be concluded as not scientifically meaningful 
because that difference only had a small impact. It is also agreed that the slight decrease in purity 
could be considered of no practical importance.  
The same comments apply to the results from finished product from pre-change and post-change 
active substance. 
There were no new peaks or variants detected in any of the comparability studies. For some attributes, 
batches fall outside the historical min-max interval and slight shifts are visible between scales. Based 
on the discussion of these differences and results from structure function studies and other data, it is 
agreed that the detected differences do not have any practical impact to the biological function of the 
product.  
batches fall outside the statistical intervals. Thus, throughout the development, increase for each 
change. However, it is agreed that there seem to be no practical impact to the biological function, 
based on binding studies and ADCC. The relevance of data from a six times higher dose in toxicology 
studies is still considered limited. 
In summary, for some attributes there are differences between scales but they are acceptably justified. 
Product from the commercial process version, , could be considered comparable to product from the 
earlier versions used in the clinical trial. 
Quality management system 
A quality management system is established and briefly described. As it relates mainly to GMP it is 
outside the scope of this assessment; however, a comment is warranted. The Applicant states that 
section 3.2.S.2.6 is not considered to be a commitment for future routine commercial manufacturing. 
Even though sections 3.2.S.2.1, 3.2.S.2.2, 3.2.S.2.3 and 3.2.S.2.4 describe the active substance 
manufacturing process to be registered, the Applicant is reminded that all parts of the MAA are 
considered equally binding. It is noted that all changes to CPPs, non-CPPs, and IPCs will be assessed 
and managed through the internal change control system and reported via a post-approval variation 
application in accordance with regional regulations and guidance. This is expected and supported. 
Characterisation 
Elucidation of structure 
Amivantamab is a fully human bispecific antibody (IgG1) that binds EGFR and MET, and also exhibit Fc 
effector functions like ADCC. It is manufactured from two parental monoclonal antibodies by a 
controlled Fab arm exchange (reduction followed by oxidation). Specific mutations on each parental 
monoclonal antibody guides the Fab arm exchange to a resulting heterodimer rather than the original 
homodimers. The host CHO cell line is engineered to express protein with low fucose content to 
increase the ADCC function. 
A comprehensive physicochemical and biological characterisation of the amivantamab molecule is 
presented. In general, the results show that amivantamab has the covalent structure, post-
translational modifications, and other characteristics of a typical monospecific human IgG1 antibody 
derived from CHO cells. Studies of primary, secondary and higher order structure, various 
physicochemical properties, carbohydrate structure, heterogeneity pattern, biological functions, 
degradation pathways, purities and impurities were included. 
An extensive panel of state-of-the-art and orthogonal tests were applied. Characterisation methods 
and preparations of variants for characterisation studies are sufficiently described. All peaks are 
CHMP assessment report

characterised and identified to a sufficient level of detail, and relevant chromatograms, peptide maps, 
spectra, electropherograms, and thermograms are provided. 
Active substance, was used for the major part of the testing. This is found acceptable.  
Experimentally confirmed extinction coefficients are presented.  
This conclusion is considered reasonable. 
It was demonstrated that HMWS consist mainly of dimers. 
Amivantamab contains N-linked glycosylation at positions EGFR HC Asn305 and MET HC Asn299. 
The proposed mechanisms of action include inhibition of EGFR and MET signalling functions, Fc 
mediated ADCC, and Fc mediated trogocytosis (target cell receptor degradation). Based on product-
specific published data, the Applicant claims that that the ADCC activity of amivantamab is primarily 
driven by the EGFR arm (an active Fc is of course also required). This is acknowledged. The biological 
function of amivantamab was characterised by the following methods:  
Representative dose-response curves are provided for these in vitro binding assays and for the other 
biological function assays as well.  
The two EGFR ADCC assays were compared by analyses of forced degradation samples. It is agreed 
that similar results were obtained.  
The two MET binding assays were compared by analyses of samples from forced degradation and 
samples from active substance and finished product stability testing. It is agreed that the methods 
show similar results on the forced degradation samples.  
Extensive forced degradation studies were performed to determine the criticality of post-translational 
modification quality attributes (PTM CQAs), including identification of the most suitable analytical 
methods for characterisation and control of these PTM CQAs. Correlation between PTM CQAs and 
receptor binding  is demonstrated. 
The probability that the PTM CQAs would impact product quality was defined as lowest, low or medium 
based on the results. The criteria for these definitions are further described in the dossier and 
considered appropriate. Glycated variants are not identified as PTM CQAs since they do not affect any 
binding. It is agreed that the levels normally present in the active substance have no negative impact 
to efficacy. 
Impurities 
Active substance product-related and process-related impurities, respectively, are listed together with 
the analytical methods for control. The main degradation routes are described and characterised. 
HMWS are present mainly as dimers, as already mentioned. Impurity criticality is discussed and 
clearance is demonstrated.  
Microorganisms, adventitious viruses, endotoxins, exotoxins (non-endotoxin pyrogens) and 
mycoplasma are considered contaminants. Regarding the issue of nitrosamines, the Applicant 
concludes that as amivantamab active substance is a biological medicinal product with no chemically 
synthesised components, no meaningful exposure to the nitrosating agents is expected and the active 
substance presents a remote risk of nitrosamine impurities.  
Sufficient information is provided regarding impurities. 
In summary, the submitted information regarding characterisation of the active substance is 
acceptable and demonstrates a solid product understanding.

2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Specifications 
The specification for active substance includes control of general characteristics (colour of solution, pH 
by Ph.Eur.), identity (Dot blot), quantity (A280 ), charge heterogeneity (cIEF), purity (SE-HPLC, 
reduced cSDS, non-reduced cSDS),  and impurities (HI-HPLC, residual HCP), potency (EGFR ADCC 
Bioassay, cMET Binding), post translational modifications (MAM Peptide map), carbohydrate structure 
(HILIC), and microbial contaminants (bioburden and endotoxins by Ph. Eur.). 
Active substance release and stability (end-of-shelf life) specifications are presented. The proposed 
stability specification acceptance criteria are the same as the release limits as no significant trends 
were found during stability testing. This is supported. 
The specifications were derived from compendial guidelines, product and process knowledge, prior 
experience with other monoclonal antibody products, and statistical analysis of release and stability 
data primarily from a clinical subset of batches. These active substance specifications are also aligned 
with the finished product specifications. The proposed list of attributes to test for is considered suitable 
and the justifications for omitting from routine testing are acceptable. 
The statistical methods used for setting specifications are described.   
The justification for active substance acceptance criteria for the carbohydrate structure (specifically 
afucosylation) and EGFR HC Met260/cMET HC oxidation is considered scientifically sound, based on the 
presented structure function relationships and calculations from batches used in the pivotal clinical trial 
(61186372EDI1001). Acceptance criteria for purity and potency are aligned with the acceptable 
finished product specification. This is supported. 
The proposed active substance specification is considered approvable. 
Analytical procedures 
A majority of the analytical procedures described for amivantamab are used for testing of both active 
substance and finished product. The procedures used for testing of both active substance and finished 
product and corresponding validations are described in sections 3.2.P.5.2 and 3.2.P.5.3, respectively. 
Two non-compendial analytical procedures are specific for the testing of active substance, 
Oligosaccharide mapping by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and Quantitation of 
residual homodimer using hydrophobic interaction high performance liquid chromatography (HI-HPLC). 
The non-compendial analytical procedures are generally described with a sufficient level of detail. 
Validation reports were provided for the three non-compendial methods, Oligosaccharide Mapping, HI-
HPLC, and host cell protein assay, demonstrating suitability for the intended use.  
Batch analysis  
Batch release results for manufacturing versions of the active substance lots are provided:.  
Batch results are generally consistent within process versions, especially for the versions. For all  
batches included, tests and results are listed but acceptance criteria are missing (it is noted that 
historical specifications are provided in section 3.2.S.2.6). The submitted batch data support a 
conclusion regarding consistent manufacture of the active substance. 
Reference standard 
Information on preparation, qualification, storage and intended use are provided for the reference 
materials. A two-tiered reference material system is applied. The current primary and working 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 24/144 
 
 
 
 
 
reference materials were prepared from active substance batches  manufactured using the 
manufacturing process. The reference standards are tested and characterised using an extensive panel 
of analytical methods and data is provided in the dossier. Acceptance criteria for potency are tighter 
compared to the proposed commercial active substance release specification. This is supported. 
Primary and working reference material are stored. The reference material is assessed annually for 
stability. This is considered appropriate. The selection, preparation, qualification and re-qualification of 
future reference materials have been described in sufficient detail, including specifications and 
characterisation testing. Information of historical reference materials have been provided. 
In summary, the reference material system is considered acceptable. 
Container closure system 
The intermediate and active substance container closure consists of a bottle with closure. The bottle is 
single use and pre-sterilised (gamma irradiated). Technical drawings of the container closure system 
are provided. 
A brief overview is provided regarding the active substance container closure material. Adherence to 
specifications is demonstrated.  
Container closure integrity is considered demonstrated. It is agreed that the described studies show 
that the integrity is maintained during freezing, storage, thawing, and shipping of materials. 
The approach described for assessment of extractables/leachables from the active substance container 
closure system is found adequate. The Applicant concludes that the level of the most abundant 
potential leachable is below the ICH M7 safety threshold, based on the dosing of the finished product, 
and that extraction studies indicate that there are no individual or cumulative levels of potential 
leachables of safety concern to patients. These conclusions are supported. 
In conclusion, the container closure system could be considered sufficiently described and found 
suitable for its intended use (storage of concentrated protein A eluate intermediates and active  
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
This section covers stability studies for the concentrated protein A eluate intermediates (anti-EGFR and 
anti-MET) and the active substance. Additional data was submitted during the procedure, although no 
concern was raised to the originally proposed shelf lives. 
The subjects covered by the description of the stability studies (including freeze-thaw, recommended, 
accelerated and stressed conditions) and the stability data are appropriate, in compliance with ICH 
Q1A(R2) and Q5C, and the chosen analytical methods appear adequately stability indicating.  
The container closure material is representative to the intermediates and active substance container 
closure, except for the volume. This is endorsed. 
The proposed commercial shelf life for amivantamab active substance and the two concentrated 
protein A eluate intermediates is at the recommended long-term storage condition.  
The Applicant concludes that the test results for all concentrated protein A eluate intermediates and 
active substance batches stored at the recommended long-term storage condition meet the acceptance 
criteria. The Applicant also concludes that the stability indicating attributes shows no apparent changes 
at the long-term storage condition as evaluated by statistical trend calculations (confidence interval 
95%) and only very limited changes during accelerated and stressed conditions. This conclusion is 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021

supported. It is also agreed that results from the forced degradation study confirm the product-related 
impurities reported under normal conditions, as outlined in 3.2.S.2.6. 
It is noted that the active substance levels of HMWS appear to be very stable also at accelerated and 
stressed conditions.  
The concentrated protein A eluate intermediate shelf-life claims are based on data  
The active substance shelf life claim is based on data. 
In summary, test results met the acceptance criteria and the stability indicating attributes shows no 
apparent changes during the recommended long-term storage conditions. Thus, the submitted data 
support shelf life at the recommended long-term storage conditions. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description of the finished product 
The finished product is a concentrate for solution for infusion filled in clear Type I glass vials with butyl 
rubber stoppers and aluminium flip-off caps. It contains no preservative and is intended for single use 
only. The solution is colourless to pale yellow, with a pH of 5.7 and an osmolality of approximately 310 
mOsm/kg.  
Besides the active ingredient, amivantamab, the composition comprises only compendial components 
typically used for formulating monoclonal antibodies and is acceptable. 
No formula overages are included. 
Pharmaceutical development 
An acceptable overview of the development of the formulation development is provided, including 
satisfactory data supporting the composition proposed for the commercial finished product. 
Two different finished product formulations have been used during development. The final commercial 
finished product contains 50 mg/mL amivantamab in 10 mM histidine, 8.5% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mg/mL 
methionine, 20 μg/mL EDTA, 0.06% (w/v) polysorbate 80, pH 5.7 stored at 2-8°C. 
The rationale used to select the final composition has been described in the dossier. The type and 
concentration of each excipient in the finished product were selected based on formulation screening, 
stability, and stress studies. Based on these studies, methionine and EDTA were added as stabilisers in 
the commercial formulation to minimise aggregation and oxidation. The robustness of the formulation 
composition was demonstrated by a robustness DoE study at concentrations of components at above 
and below the target concentrations. 
Three different manufacturing processes for finished product have been used during development. as 
the finished product manufacturing processes were named in accordance with the corresponding active 
substance process scale. The manufacturing process changes performed during development have 
mainly been related to site changes and scale up. There is no complete overview of the process 
development provided in this section, instead, much of the relevant information is given in section 
S.2.6 Comparability. The different finished product process versions have been described in sufficient 
detail with respect to changes to the finished product manufacturing process. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 26/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Comparability for both active substance and finished product is described in section 3.2.S.2.6 and it 
can be concluded that finished product used in the clinical development can be considered 
representative of the commercial product. 
The development of the control strategy is generally well explained and acceptable justification has 
been provided. The CQA identification process and criticality assessment are well described, and 
sufficient justification was presented. The CPPs are listed and sufficiently justified. 
A section providing the development history of analytical procedures is presented. 
The development of the primary container closure system is sufficiently described. The safety of the 
materials of construction was established in accordance with the relevant standards. Extractables 
studies have been performed and leachables studies are ongoing. The results obtained so far do not 
indicate any toxicological concern. 
The information related to microbiological attributes is found acceptable. Container closure integrity is 
being monitored by blue dye ingress testing as part of the ongoing stability study. 
Compatibility of diluted finished product with IV bags and administration sets of polypropylene, 
polyethylene, polyolefin, polyurethane, polybutadiene and polyvinylchloride contact materials has been 
demonstrated. During administration, use of an in-line filter is required based on the visible and 
subvisible particulate results, and this is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured at Cilag AG, Schaffhausen, Switzerland, while Janssen Biologics 
B.V., Einsteinweg 101, 2333 CB Leiden, The Netherlands is responsible for batch release into the EU. 
The commercial finished product manufacturing process is referred to as in other sections of the 
dossier. 
The finished product manufacturing process is summarised in a flow chart and detailed in a written 
narrative. The manufacturing process consists of active substance thawing, compounding (pooling by 
pre-filtration and mixing), sterile filtration, aseptic filling, stoppering, and capping. The finished product 
vials are then optically inspected before secondary packaging and stored at 2-8°C. The manufacturing 
process is described in sufficient detail. 
No reprocessing has been described in the dossier. 
A summary of process parameters and corresponding PARs is presented. There are four CPPs 
identified:. The CPPs as well as all PARs have been acceptably justified by data presented in section 
3.2.P.2.3. Hold times were acceptably justified by validation data presented in section 3.2.P.3.5 and all 
applied hold times have been listed in a separate table in the manufacturing description.  
The batch numbering system is described in Section 3.2.P.5.4 Batch analyses. 
The information provided in this section of the dossier is sufficiently detailed.  
All IPC limits are applied as acceptance criteria. The proposed limits are acceptably justified by data 
presented in section 3.2.P.2.3. The bioburden limit applied before sterile filtration is in accordance with 
guideline requirements. 
There are no intermediates isolated in the finished product manufacturing process. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021

Process validation 
The process validation followed a traditional approach and covered four consecutive production scale 
batches. The validation was run at set points while the ranges of process parameters were challenged 
during the manufacturing process development described in 3.2.P.2.3. This approach is found 
acceptable. The results of IPCs and process characterisation samples met their predefined acceptance 
criteria, and all CPPs were controlled within their predefined ranges. All release results met finished 
product release specifications, and all process validation batches demonstrated consistent quality 
profiles, demonstrating that the finished product can be consistently manufactured within predefined 
processing parameters. 
The presented filter validation comprises membrane compatibility, bacterial retention validation, and 
air diffusion and bubble point determination. Membrane extractables/leachables were also evaluated. 
The results demonstrate that the membrane is chemically compatible and suitable for use during 
finished product manufacture. 
Media fills are described, and re-qualification is performed twice per year. 
Shipping qualification and transportation studies were performed and support the transportation during 
commercial distribution. 
In conclusion, the process validation data are acceptable. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
Specifications 
The specification proposed for amivantamab finished product  includes control of appearance, colour of 
solution (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), turbidity (Ph. 
Eur), polysorbate 80 content, visible particles (Ph. Eur.), subvisible particles (Ph.Eur.), identity (dot 
blot), quantity (A280 ), charge heterogeneity (cIEF), purity (SE-HPLC, reduced cSDS, non-reduced 
cSDS)and impurities, potency (EGFR ADCC Bioassay, cMET Binding), post translational modifications 
(MAM Peptide map), and microbial contaminants (sterility Ph. Eur.), Endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and 
container closure integrity. 
The proposed finished product release and end of shelf life specifications are found acceptable with 
respect to proposed test parameters. Sterility is tested at release only, while for stability the test for 
container closure integrity is performed to confirm sterility. This is acceptable. 
 The Applicant states that the used process ensured that the proposed finished product specifications 
were aligned with the clinical exposure levels of the CQAs, and this can be agreed to.  
Batches used as the basis to set specifications are listed. The batches are referred to either as the 
“Total manufacturing experience” comprising  finished product batches manufactured from active 
substance or the “Clinical data subset”. It is clearly stated which finished product batches were used in 
the pivotal study submitted with this MAA, and the selection of batches for the “Clinical data subset” 
has been acceptably justified. It has been confirmed that finished product of the proposed commercial 
manufacturing process has been used in the clinic. 
The statistical methods used for setting specifications are described.  The justification and data 
provided by the Applicant are considered acceptable. 
The acceptance criteria proposed for colour, pH, extractable volume, osmolality, turbidity, polysorbate 
80, particles (visible foreign, and sub-visible), identity, quantity, potency (MET), charge variants 
(cIEF), purity (cSDS reduced and non-reduced), and post transitional modifications (Asp99

Page 28/144 
 
 
 
 
 
isomerisation by multi-attribute method (MAM) peptide mapping), endotoxin, sterility, and container 
closure integrity have been sufficiently justified and are approvable.  
For visible translucent particlesGiven that an in-line filter will be used during patient administration by 
infusion, the proposed limit is found approvable. 
The acceptance criteria for potency by EGFR ADCC are proposed based on clinical experience rather 
than on the wider range obtained by calculation of predictive intervals and are found acceptable. 
In conclusion, the finished product specification is approvable. 
Analytical procedures 
The following tests are performed in accordance with Ph. Eur.: Colour of Solution (Ph. Eur. 2.2.2), 
Extractable volume (Ph. Eur. 2.9.17), Osmolality (Ph. Eur. 2.2.35), Particulate matter (sub-visible) (Ph. 
Eur. 2.9.19), Particulate matter (visible foreign) (Ph. Eur. 2.9.20), Bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur. 
2.6.14), Sterility (Ph. Eur. 2.6.1), Turbidity (Ph. Eur. 2.2.1), and pH (Ph. Eur. 2.2.3). 
The non-compendial analytical procedures used for both active substance and finished product are 
described in this section and are described with a sufficient level of detail.  
Validation reports for all non-compendial test methods were provided. The reports are comprehensive 
and demonstrate suitability of the methods proposed for routine testing. Suitability of the compendial 
methods for endotoxin and sterility was verified as appropriate. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses data has been provided for the four process validation batches, which are also included 
as stability batches, manufactured using the proposed commercial process and at commercial scale. All 
data complies with the proposed finished product specifications.  
In addition, batch analyses data is also included for development batches. 
In conclusion, the batch analyses data demonstrates acceptable batch-to-batch consistency and 
reproducibility of the manufacturing process proposed for the finished product. 
Reference standard 
The reference standard system described in the dossier is used for testing of both finished product and 
active substance. 
Characterisation of impurities 
A majority of the product-related impurities for finished product are the same as for active substance, 
except for translucent particles that are applicable specifically to the finished product. Visible and 
subvisible translucent particles were monitored and the results indicate that the translucent particles 
are mainly composed of protein. No significant increase of translucent subvisible or visible particles 
was demonstrated upon storage at long-term, accelerated or stressed conditions, or after freeze-thaw, 
light exposure or shipping/transportation. Translucent particles will be controlled by the proposed 
finished product specification.  
A comprehensive risk evaluation report regarding the potential presence of nitrosamines in the finished 
product was provided. The following components of the finished product were assessed to determine if 
the risk of nitrosating conditions or the presence of nitrosamines exist in the finished product: active 
substance manufacturing, raw materials, excipients and water, finished product manufacturing and 
primary packaging. By evaluating the production process, product components and packaging the 
Applicant concludes there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product. The conclusion is 
endorsed, and thus the outcome of the nitrosamine risk evaluation is considered acceptable. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 29/144 
 
 
 
 
 
An elemental impurity risk assessment in accordance with ICH Q3D was performed, taking into account 
potential contributions from the active substance, excipients, processing water, manufacturing 
equipment and container closure system. Analytical screening using inductively coupled plasma-mass-
spectrometry (ICP-MS) was also performed. Control threshold concentrations based on parenteral 
permitted daily exposures (PDEs) and maximum daily finished product intake were calculated for all 
elemental impurities. The Applicant concluded that none of the elemental impurities assessed are 
expected to exceed their corresponding control thresholds in the finished product and that the levels of 
the elemental impurities in the finished product do not exceed the permitted levels. The conclusion is 
endorsed, and thus the outcome of the elemental risk assessment is considered acceptable.  
Container closure system 
The container closure system used for finished product is a 8 mL Type 1 glass vial closed with a 
fluoropolymer coated 20-mm stopper and a 20-mm aluminum seal with a flip-off cap. For the primary 
packaging materials acceptable specifications, critical dimensions and drawings are provided in the 
dossier. 
The information provided in this section is found acceptable. The materials in contact with the product 
comply with Ph. Eur. The glass vial complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 “Glass Containers for Pharmaceutical 
use” and the rubber stopper complies with Ph. Eur, 3.2.9 “Rubber closures for containers for aqueous 
parenteral preparations, for parenteral use”. 
The sterilisation of the vials and stoppers is described in section P.3.5. The vials are washed and 
sterilised/depyrogenated on site prior to finished product manufacture at Cilag AG using a dry heat 
depyrogenation tunnel. The stoppers are provided by the supplier as prewashed and ready-to-sterilise. 
The stoppers are sterilised onsite at Cilag AG by a closure processor system using a fractionated 
vacuum method alternating with steam injections (moist heat). The information provided on 
sterilisation of the vials and stoppers is considered sufficient. The aluminum crimp seals with a flip-off 
cap are supplied ready to use by the vendors, i.e., pre-washed but not sterilised. Given that the 
stoppered vials are capped in a Grade C environment this is acceptable. 
The photostability testing (P.8.1) indicates that the finished product is sensitive to light, however it 
was demonstrated that the secondary packaging provides sufficient protection. A precautionary 
statement that the product should be stored in the carton has been included in the SmPC. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life is 24 months at 2°C-8°C, protected from light.  
The stability studies are being performed in accordance with ICH guidelines. The Applicant considers all 
primary stability batches to be representative of the commercial manufacturing process, and this can 
be agreed, as comparability between the scales has been demonstrated. 
The stability testing was performed according to the proposed specifications and comprise the following 
parameters: bioactivity (EGFR ADCC bioassay, MET binding), purity by cSDS (reduced and non-
reduced), purity by SE-HPLC (main component, HMWS), charge heterogeneity by cIEF, quantity, pH, 
colour of solution, turbidity, particulate matter (sub-visible and visible translucent MDI), peptide 
mapping and container closure integrity testing (CCIT). The analytical procedures are identical to those 
described in section P.5.2. The stability-indicating properties of the analytical procedures were 
demonstrated during method validation. 
The finished product stability studies were conducted using product packaging representative of the 
commercial product packaging described in section 3.2.P.7. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 30/144 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical batches have currently reached the 24 months’ time point, while batches have reached the 18 
months’ time point and batches the 12 months’ time point. For the process validation batches,  batches 
have reached the 12 months’ time point and  batch the 9 months’ time point.  
At the long-term conditions (5±3°C) all results for all parameters are within the specifications.  
At accelerated and stressed conditions more pronounced changes were observed over time,  
A photostability study was conducted in accordance with ICH Q1B. The results show that the finished 
product is sensitive to light however the commercial secondary packaging will provide adequate light 
protection. This has been properly addressed in the SmPC. 
The Applicant commits to continue the ongoing stability studies up to 36 months according to the 
testing schedule presented. 
Based on the presented stability data, the proposed shelf life of 24 months at 2°C-8°C, protected from 
light is approvable. 
Based on the results obtained in the compatibility and microbial challenge studies, an in-use storage 
time of 10 hours at 20-25°C after dilution in 5% dextrose or saline is proposed for the finished 
product. This is acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No animal-derived or human-derived material was used during manufacture of the MCBs and the 
WCBs, and no such material is used during manufacture of the active substance. Foetal bovine serum 
and advanced DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12) including human 
plasma-derived transferrin and bovine serum albumin were used during single cell cloning of the 
development cell banks (used for manufacture of the MCBs). Human recombinant insulin expressed in 
yeast was also used. Early use of rabbit serum (non-TSE relevant) is also mentioned. EDQM certificates 
of suitability are provided for the sera, and certificates of origin are available for the human plasma-
derived transferrin including collection and testing. A TSE statement is provided in annex 5.12 to the 
application form, and the animal-derived sera and human transferrin are appropriately listed. The 
information provided regarding animal- and human-derived materials is considered sufficient and 
together with the testing of the cell banks, the unprocessed bulk and the validation of virus clearance 
during active substance manufacturing, it is concluded that the risk for presence/transmission of TSE is 
very low. 
In accordance with ICH Q5D the cell substrates, MCB and WCB used for manufacturing of 
amivantamab were assessed for sterility and mycoplasma at Charles River Laboratories. The MCB and 
WCB cell banks were determined to be sterile and tested negative for mycoplasma. Control of 
mycoplasma, bioburden and endotoxin is further managed through routine in-process testing. The viral 
testing was performed in compliance with ICH Q5A (R1) at the appropriate levels. The general 
approach, the testing, and the results are acceptable. Routine testing for adventitious virus using four 
cell lines was proposeded to be a 14-day assay, considering the overall viral safety approach, this is 
acceptable. 
Virus clearance studies have been performed.  Both RT-PCR and infectivity assays have been used. 
In general, for all virus studies the lowest clearance data for runs has been summarised as a

results provided in section 3.2.A.2 discusses the relevant controls and design of virus clearance 
studies, although further details are requested.  This is found acceptable.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The dossier is of good quality. 
Characterisation of amivantamab was performed using an extensive panel of appropriate methods. 
A science- and risk-based approach with QbD elements was used for process development and process 
characterisation, supporting the proposed manufacturing process control strategy and demonstrating a 
solid process understanding. The active substance and finished product manufacturing processes and 
process controls are appropriately described, and the processes are appropriately validated. 
Three versions of the manufacturing process are presented. Changes are clearly described for 
manufacture of the parental monoclonal antibodies and the active substance, as well as the finished 
product process. There are differences between scales for some attributes but they are acceptably 
justified. Product from the commercial process version,  can be considered comparable to product from 
the earlier versions used in the clinical trial. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Rybrevant is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physico-chemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the marketing authorisation 
application for Rybrevant is considered approvable from the quality point of view.  
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Amivantamab is a first-in-class, low fucose human bispecific immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 based antibody, 
directed against the EGF and MET receptors.  
Amivantamab is produced in an engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line where low levels of 
fucose are incorporated into carbohydrate chains attached to the antibodies. One antigen-binding 
fragment (Fab) arm binds epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the other binds the 
mesenchymalepithelial transition factor (cMet), also known as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) 
receptor. Amivantamab acts by blocking ligand binding and prevents receptor activation by inhibition of 
phosphorylation followed by downregulation and trogocytocis. This is mediated by Fc-domain 
interaction with immune cells and the interaction is simplified by low fucosylation of antibodies. The 
presence of EGFR and cMet on the surface of tumour cells allows amivantamab to bind and target the 
cells for destruction by immune effector cells through Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
and/or Antibody-dependent cellular trogocytosis (ADCT) mechanisms.  
Amivantamab is indicated for treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
when the NSCLC has progressed on, or after platinum-based chemotherapy, i.e. in patients with Exon 
20 insertion mutation, and /or resistance to current EGFR therapies including secondary and tertiary 
mutations in EGFR, and MET amplification or mutation. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacodynamics studies aimed at characterisation of amivantamab binding affinities to 
human, mouse, rat and cynomolgus monkey EGFR and MET extracellular domains as well as to FcRγ, 
in vitro functional activity in various cancer cell lines, and in vivo activity in various xenograft tumour 
models including tumours with EGFR and MET gene amplifications and EGFR activating mutations and 
mutations conferring resistance to TKIs. 
In vitro studies 
Amivantamab blocks the binding of human EGF and HGF to the extra cellular domain (ECD) of human 
EGFR and MET with an IC50-value of 10 and 30 nM respectively, shown in an ELISA format. 
Amivantamab displayed a Kd value of 1.43 and 0.04 nM for EGFR and Met respectively, by a surface 
plasmon resonance kinetic study. In addition, disruption of EGF-induced homodimerization of EGFR and 
heterodimerization of EGFR:ErBB2 was also confirmed using PathHunter® assays.  
Amivantamab inhibited in vitro biological activity of EGFR and MET in a dose dependent manner in 
human lung cancer cell lines including those with EGFR primary activating mutations (L858R or 
deletions in Exon 19), EGFR gene amplification, the EGFR T790M mutation that confers resistance to 
EGFR TKIs, and the EGFR T790M mutation accompanied by MET gene amplification as well as cell lines 
with WT EGFR and WT MET. Amivantamab inhibited ligand-induced formation of phosphorylated pEGFR 
and pMET in a concentration-dependent manner in all cell lines tested. In addition, assays on 
downstream key signalling pathways from EGFR and cMet activation were analysed; Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK 
and PI3K/Akt. Amivantamab inhibited phosphorylation of ERK and AKT in a panel of cell lines including 
various EGFR mutations and cells with wild-type receptors. No effect was observed in cell lines with 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 33/144 
 
 
 
 
 
MET amplification (H1993 and SNU-5). Amivantamab was also shown to possess higher activity against 
ERK and AKT phosphorylation compared to a mixture of monovalent EGF- and MET antibodies.  
Amivantamab did not substantially inhibit cell viability in in vitro standard 2D assays (except for EGFR 
wt/cMet wt cell line SKMES-1 and H292 to some extent), but showed better activity in a 3D assay 
format, inhibiting survival in cell lines with WT EGFR as well as mutant EGFR. Amivantamab inhibited 
proliferation and promoted apoptosis of tumour cell lines that are mutant for EGFR (H1975) or 
amplified for MET (SNU-5), which occurred only when tumour cells and amivantamab were co-cultured 
with human PBMCs. 
Moreover, ADCC activity of Amivantamab against a variety of WT or mutant EGFR, WT or amplified 
cMet, as well as WT or mutant K-RAS cell lines was confirmed in different cell lines. The ADCC 
response of Amivantamab has also been shown to be dependent on the presence of human PBMC. With 
addition of human PBMC, Amivantamab induced a concentration-dependent decrease in tumour cell 
proliferation, with maximum anti-proliferative effect observed at 72 hours (IC50 = 0.005 µg/mL). 
Amivantamab treatment also resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in apoptosis in the 
presence of PBMCs (IC50 = 0.0004 µg/mL). In addition, the response is stronger by the low fucose 
Amivantamab compared to the normal fucose equivalent version. The importance of the Fc region of 
Amivantamab in activation of immune cells has been demonstrated in several studies by comparing the 
effect by Amivantamab to its Fc silent version, IgG2-sigma. Thus, these data indicate that the 
interaction between the Fc region of Amivantamab and the effector immune cells, is an important 
factor in the mode of action by Amivantamab in the anti-tumoral effect. 
The impact of amivantamab Fc interaction on EGFR and cMet protein and phospho-protein levels was 
evaluated in H1975 cells (EGFR mutations L858R/T790M and WT for MET) co-cultured with or without 
PBMCs. Treatment with amivantamab alone in the absence of PBMCs showed marginal effects on the 
levels of EGFR, pEGFR, and cMet proteins. In contrast, the presence of PBMCs markedly potentiated 
amivantamab-mediated downregulation of EGFR, pEGFR, and cMet by 46%, 67%, and 44% 
respectively. The corresponding figures in the MET-amplified cell line model SNU-5, was 79%, 89%, 
87%, and 90% in EGFR, pEGFR, cMet, and pMet proteins, respectively, compared to the protein levels 
in the absence of PBMCs. Co-culture experiments in H1975 tumour cells showed that monocytes and 
macrophages were required for amivantamab-mediated downregulation of EGFR and cMet proteins. A 
positive correlation between the percentage of monocytes in the PMBC from the donors and the ability 
to downregulate EGF, pEGF and cMet was shown, while no correlation was found for T-, B-, or NK-cells. 
Moreover, confocal microscopic studies visualised labelled Amivantamab localised inside M1 and M2c 
polarised macrophages, and in monocytes cocultured with H1975 cells suggesting that Amivantamab 
downmodulates EGFR and c-Met through a trogocytosis mechanism.  
In vivo studies 
The importance of tumour-associated-macrophages, TAMs, was assessed in a xenograft study using a 
macrophage-depleting antibody (αCSF1R), showing a decreased tumour growth inhibition by 
Amivantamab from 72.8% to 38.5% (p=0.014), suggesting that macrophages play a key role in 
mediating the anti-tumour efficacy of amivantamab in vivo. 
In the H1975-HGF xenograft model, Amivantamab exhibited a synergistic effect over treatment with 
the monovalent antibodies, as single treatments or in combination with monovalent antibodies.   
Various studies on xenograft models have been performed. The effect was successful (tumour growth 
inhibition (TGI) >77%) on cancer cells expressing EGFR insertion mutation T790M exon 20 and 
substitution mutation L858R exon 21 with MET wt receptor in NSCLC, either PDX-derived- or H1975 
xenografts with or without human HGF expression. Similarly successful was the treatment on the EGFR 
deletion mutation (del E746-A750 exon 19) in the NSCLC cell line HCC827, with MET amplification or 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 34/144 
 
 
 
 
 
MET wt, or with human HGF expression with MET wt. The IC50 value for pEGFR was 1.5 and 29 nM in 
H1975 and HCC827, respectively, and for pMet between 0.64-2.1 nM and the IC50 for pERK and pAKT 
was <2 nM for both H1975 and HCC827. 
Interestingly, in contrast to H1975, Amivantamab did not show activity on viability in cell lines with 
MET amplification (SNU-5, H1993) in in vitro low attachment cell cultures. In vivo, however, 
Amivantamab inhibited SNU-5 tumours with a TGI of 97% while Amivantamab treatment on H1993 
xenografts remained unaffected (TGI%=11, non-significant). This indicates that additional factors 
(such as immune cells) are required for Amivantamab to inhibit cell viability in some type of tumours 
as well as other cellular features.  
The effect of Amivantamab on PDX xenograft models varied, with the best effect in NSCLC (TGI42-
81%) and gastric PDX (TGI 67%) and less effective in colorectal PDX models despite a number of 
studies (TGI 59% in one PDX model of seven investigated).  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology parameters (cardiovascular, respiratory and observational CNS safety 
pharmacology endpoints) were evaluated in the repeat-dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys. The applicant did not submit any in vitro safety pharmacology studies such as hERG channel 
testing.  
No cardiovascular, respiratory, or observational CNS findings occurred in cynomolgus monkeys 
administered amivantamab at IV doses up to 120 mg/kg/week for up to 13 doses in the 3-month 
toxicity study. Non-sedated monkeys had qualitatively normal electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, no 
changes in ECG parameters or abnormalities in rhythm or waveform morphology, and no 
amivantamab-related effects on heart rate or blood pressure, respiration rate, or body temperature. 
Moreover, there were no amivantamab-related changes noted on veterinary physical examinations or 
daily cage-side observations or weekly detailed observations. At the highest dose tested, 120 
mg/kg/week for the 6-week and 3-month monkey GLP studies, mean Cmax values after the last dose 
were 5040 and 5232 μg/mL, respectively, corresponding to approximately 6-fold the clinical Cmax. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamics drug interactions studies have been conducted. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) methods on the MesoScale Discovery (MSD®) platform 
were used for the quantification of amivantamab serum concentrations and for the detection of anti-
drug antibodies (ADA) in serum in the single-dose PK, 1-month tolerability, pivotal 6-week and 3-
month repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys. An ECLIA method was also used for quantification 
of amivantamab serum concentrations in the subcutaneous (SC) local tolerance study in cynomolgus 
monkeys. Validation reports for the qualified method (CP2014Q-030) and the validated method 
(CP2015V-005) have been provided. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 35/144 
 
 
 
 
 
A validated MSD ECLIA (CP2014V-036) was also used to detect antibodies directed against 
amivantamab in cynomolgus monkey serum samples obtained in the single-dose PK, 1-month 
tolerability, pivotal 6-week and 3-month repeat-dose toxicity studies. The ADA assay was validated for 
cynomolgus monkey serum in terms of naïve sample reactivity, intra-assay and inter-assay precision, 
sensitivity, specificity, and robustness. The validation was not formally performed in compliance with 
GLP. 
Absorption 
The PK and immunogenicity of amivantamab was studied in cynomolgus monkeys following a single IV 
injection of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg. The Cmax of amivantamab increased in an approximately dose-
proportional manner between 3 and 30 mg/kg, but AUCinf increased in a greater than dose-
proportional manner. As the dose level increased from 3 to 10 to 30 mg/kg, clearance values 
decreased from 19.93 to 12.67 and 9.12 mL/day/kg, respectively, indicating a trend toward saturation 
of target-mediated drug disposition. There were no differences in PK parameters observed between 
sexes within each dose group. The distribution volume indicated that amivantamab is mainly located in 
the plasma compartment. 
Nine out of 12 animals (3 from each group) tested positive for ADA. Serum drug concentration-time 
profiles from ADA-positive animals were similar to the profiles from ADA-negative animals, except for 2 
ADA-positive animals that exhibited lower amivantamab concentrations after Day 22. 
Distribution 
No tissue distribution studies were conducted with amivantamab.  
Metabolism 
No dedicated metabolism studies were performed for amivantamab. 
Excretion 
As a monoclonal antibody, no urinary excretion is anticipated due to its molecular size. Therefore, no 
specific studies to measure excretion amivantamab were performed. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
A limited toxicology program has been conducted for amivantamab, largely in accordance with ICH S6 
and S9 guidance, to support IV administration for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations, 
after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The program included repeat-dose toxicity studies incorporating safety pharmacology endpoints, a 
weight of evidence for reproductive and developmental toxicity, in vitro studies on human blood and 
serum compatibility, in vitro cytokine release in human blood, and SC local tolerance. All pivotal 
studies were conducted in accordance with GLP. 
Species selection for toxicity testing 
The cynomolgus monkey was selected as a pharmacologically relevant species for the safety 
assessment of amivantamab. Amivantamab exhibited a similar binding affinity to cynomolgus monkey 
and human EGFR and MET, respectively, as well as a similar ability to inhibit phosphorylation of c-MET. 
However, inhibition of EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR was approximately 10-fold lower in 
cynomolgus monkey lung fibroblasts compared to human lung fibroblasts.

2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single-dose toxicity studies have been performed with amivantamab. This is agreed. No clinical 
signs of acute toxicity were observed in cynomolgus monkeys following the first weekly IV dose of up 
to 120 mg/kg in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The repeat-dose toxicity of amivantamab in cynomolgus monkeys was evaluated in a 4-week 
tolerability non-GLP study, and 6-week toxicity with 6-week recovery and 13-week toxicity GLP 
studies. In addition to standard toxicological evaluations, safety pharmacology assessments were 
incorporated into the study designs. Cardiovascular system safety was evaluated by electrocardiogram 
(ECG) recordings, blood pressure, and heart rate. Respiratory system safety was evaluated by 
respiration rate and clinical signs. Central nervous system safety was evaluated by body temperature 
and clinical signs. There were no apparent safety signals of amivantamab on the cardiovascular 
system, respiratory system, or central nervous system in cynomolgus monkeys (see further in section 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme).  
Amivantamab was well tolerated when administered IV once weekly at doses up to 120 mg/kg/week 
for 13 weeks (13 doses). There were no dose-limiting toxicity and no clear target organs of toxicity 
and the minor findings, all considered non-adverse, are presented below. 
Gastrointestinal tract 
The were no clear or adverse GI effects noted in amivantamab-treated animals, although a few 
observations where a relation to treatment cannot be excluded were observed. 
In the 13-week study, slight to moderate liquid faeces occurred in some female monkeys at 120 
mg/kg/week. As there were no other associated changes in body weights, disturbances in electrolytes, 
or findings at gross or microscopic pathology, the observation of liquid faeces is considered non-
adverse. Given that diarrhoea, or soft or liquid faeces, is a common finding with other mAbs targeting 
EGFR such as panitumumab (Vectibix) and cetuximab (Erbitux), a relation to amivantamab treatment 
seems possible. However, it is also noted that non-specific diarrhoea (i.e. not associated with an 
etiologic agent) is a common background finding in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Gross pathology findings of multifocal dark red foci with or without depression were noted in the 
gastric fundus of the stomach in a few animals (all males and 1 female at 60 mg/kg/week and 1 male 
at 120 mg/kg/week). The gross findings correlated with microscopic observations of minimal to mild 
focal to multifocal acute mucosal haemorrhage, and in one animal the dark red focus was also noted to 
be depressed and correlated microscopically with mucosal degeneration/erosion.  
Microscopic pathology findings were observed in the stomach at ≥ 60 mg/kg/week. Minimal 
mucosal/glandular epithelial degeneration/regeneration was seen in one animal in each group at ≥60 
mg/kg/week and included occasional foci of dilated gastric glands that contained rare sloughed necrotic 
epithelial cells and/or mixed neutrophilic infiltrates; minimal focal mucosal erosion noted in one 60 
mg/kg/week group female; and focal epithelial basophilia/regeneration, consistent with a reparative 
response seen in another 60 mg/kg/week group male. Both findings were associated with acute 
haemorrhage.  
Liver 
Slight or minimal ALT and AST elevations were observed in the amivantamab repeat-dose studies. In 
the 4-week non-GLP tolerability study, minimal elevations in ALT and AST without histopathological 
liver correlates were observed at 100 mg/kg/week. In the 6-week GLP study, minimal, non-dose 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 37/144 
 
 
 
 
 
dependent elevations in liver enzymes (ALT at ≥20 mg/kg/week, AST at 20 and 120 mg/kg/week) with 
no microscopic correlates in the liver were observed. The findings were reversible following a 6-week 
recovery period. 
In the 13-week study, no alterations in liver enzymes were observed but minimal to mild Kupffer cell 
hypertrophy and cytoplasmic pigment was noted at both dose levels (60 and 120 mg/kg/week) in 
similar incidence and severity. This finding was considered likely related to test article clearance (Rojko 
et al., 2014).  
Kidney 
In the 13-week study, mild to minimal histopathological changes in the kidney were observed at 60 
and 120 mg/kg/week without correlative changes in kidney-related clinical pathology parameters. 
Minimal tubular regeneration was noted at ≥60 mg/kg/week. At 120 mg/kg/week, 
degenerative/regenerative tubules were associated with minimal interstitial mixed cell infiltrates (with 
amphophilic material accumulation) in two males. The pathologist interpretation is that the tubule 
changes were suggestive of prior injury that is in the state of repair. 
Haematology 
Transient (Day 2 only) and mild increases in neutrophils associated with increases in white blood cell 
count, as well as decreased eosinophil and lymphocyte counts, occurred only in the 6 week study at 
120 mg/kg/week. Minimal decreases in albumin at all doses and increases in globulin, with resultant 
decreases in the albumin:globulin ratio, in the 6- and 13-week studies at ≥60 mg/kg/week were 
consistent with a mild acute phase response. These clinical pathology changes had no histopathological 
correlates and were shown to be reversible after a 6-week recovery period in the 6-week study, 
although a non-adverse decrease in albumin was noted for 1 female in each recovery group. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were conducted with amivantamab.  
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with amivantamab. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No developmental or reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with amivantamab. Regarding 
developmental toxicity, a weight-of-evidence assessment on potential consequences of disruption of 
the EGFR and MET pathways has been provided. Data from knockout mice indicate that EGFR and MET 
have critical roles during embryonic development. While data from knockout models should be 
interpreted with caution, data from both small molecule and mAbs support the view that disruption of 
the EGFR and MET pathways are likely to cause adverse effects on embryo-foetal and postnatal 
development and survival.  
2.5.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance to IV administration of amivantamab was assessed as part of the general repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. In the pivotal GLP 6-week and 3-month toxicity studies, there 
were no amivantamab-related effects on clinical observations or histopathology evaluation of 
administration sites following IV doses of up to 120 mg/kg/week for 5 or 13 doses.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 38/144 
 
 
 
 
 
A dedicated study was performed to assess local tolerance to SC administration in cynomolgus 
monkeys. SC administration of amivantamab with and without rHuPH20 was well tolerated at the sites 
of injection. 
2.5.4.7.  Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
The development of ADAs to amivantamab in cynomolgus monkeys was evaluated in the 1-month 
tolerability study, 6-week toxicity GLP study with a 6-week recovery period, and 3-month toxicity 
study. Among the 55 cynomolgus monkeys administered weekly IV doses of amivantamab, 8 tested 
positive for the presence of ADA: 2 of 9 animals in the 1-month tolerability study (1 each in the 30 and 
100 mg/kg/week dose groups) and 6 of 30 animals in the 6-week toxicity study (3, 2, and 1 in the 20, 
60, and 120 mg/kg/week dose groups, respectively). All 16 animals in the 3-month toxicity study 
tested ADA negative. Potential interference of ADA by residual drug was not excluded in ADA-negative 
animals in these studies. It should be noted that immunogenicity studies in animals are not predictive 
of the human immunogenic response. 
Immunotoxicity 
Immunotoxicity was evaluated by standard parameters in the repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys. No amivantamab-related microscopic changes were observed in lymphatic organs (e.g., 
thymus, mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, tonsils, spleen, gut-associated lymphoid tissue). 
Haematological changes noted only in the 6-week toxicity study (mild increases in neutrophil count and 
decreases in lymphocyte and eosinophil counts on Day 2 at 120 mg/kg/week), although similar to 
those associated with physiological stress, were considered potentially treatment-related because they 
occurred only at the high dose. 
Tissue cross-reactivity 
In monkey and human in vitro tissue cross-reactivity studies, membrane staining was observed in the 
epithelium of multiple tissues, including peripheral nerve sheath cells and in human placental decidual 
cells, which is consistent with the expected expression of EGFR and MET. 
Cytokine release assay 
In an in vitro assay using human blood, the cytokine release profile for amivantamab was similar to 
that of the negative control, indicating a low risk for cytokine release syndrome. 
Serum compatibility and haemolytic potential  
Serum compatibility and haemolytic potential of amivantamab were evaluated by incubating graded 
concentrations (0.025 to 25 mg/mL). There was no evidence of amivantamab induced serum 
precipitation or haemolysis of human blood. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Amivantamab is a monoclonal antibody and is consequently classified as a protein. According to the 
Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides and proteins are exempted because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Consequently, no environmental risk 
assessment for amivantamab is required. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 39/144 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The relevance of selected species in the pharmacological and pivotal toxicological studies has been 
demonstrated. For the pharmacology efficacy studies, mouse models with human cell xenografts were 
used, and Amivantamab did not exhibit any interaction with murine c-Met or EGFR in cross-reactivity 
studies while beneficial properties against human c-Met or EGFR have been shown, which is 
satisfactory. In addition, a cross-reactivity study with tissues from standard toxicology species using 
Zalutumumab, a parental antibody of Amivantamab targeting human EGFR was presented. 
Zalutumumab reacts with tissues from human, cynomolgus monkey and dog but not to mouse, pig, 
rabbit or rat. Furthermore, the binding affinity of Amivantamab was similar between cynomolgus 
monkey and human EGFR and Met respectively, and inhibition of HGF-induced phosphorylation of c-
Met was comparable between the two species. However, the inhibition of the EGF-induced 
phosphorylation of EGFR was approximately 10-fold lower in Cynomolgus lung fibroblasts compared to 
human lung fibroblasts. This may explain the relatively mild toxicity profile observed in the 
Cynomolgus monkey in comparison to other pharmaceuticals inhibiting EGFR. 
Pharmacology 
Amivantamab inhibits a broader range of tumour growth, including those driven by aberrant EGFR 
and/or MET signalling for growth. Amivantamab was shown to possess higher activity against ERK and 
AKT phosphorylation compared to a mixture of monovalent EGF- and MET antibodies. This may 
indicate that treatment with bispecific amivantamab could be more efficient than blocking EGFR and 
MET receptors with two separate entities. A description of the pharmacological function of 
amivantamab, a bi-specific antibody, was presented with the aim to increase tolerability compared to 
other EGFR bivalent antibodies due to less avidity via a single binding arm to EGFR in normal tissues. 
Safety pharmacology parameters (cardiovascular, respiratory and observational CNS safety 
pharmacology endpoints) were evaluated in the repeat-dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys. This approach is in line with the ICH S6(R1) guidance. The applicant did not submit any in 
vitro safety pharmacology studies such as hERG channel testing. This is acceptable considering the 
nature of the drug product (a monoclonal antibody). In summary, there were no apparent safety 
signals of amivantamab on the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, or central nervous system 
in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of amivantamab is considered as adequately characterised for the 
proposed indication. No dedicated distribution, metabolism or excretion studies were performed, and 
this is considered acceptable and in agreement with the ICH S6(R1) guideline. The metabolic pathways 
of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals are generally understood and include degradation to small 
peptides and individual amino acids. 
Toxicology 
Overall, the scope of the amivantamab toxicology program is considered adequate and in agreement 
with ICH S6 and S9 guidance.  
Cynomolgus monkey was selected as a relevant species for safety assessment of amivantamab. This is 
agreed. 
In the repeat-dose toxicity monkey studies, amivantamab was well tolerated when administered IV 
once weekly at doses up to 120 mg/kg/week for 3 months (13 doses). There were no dose-limiting 
toxicity or adverse effects expected from inhibition of EFGR and MET such as on-target effects in 
tissues of epithelial origin were observed with exception of mild effects in the GI tract with unclear 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021

relation to amivantamab-treatment. However, the exposure margin at the highest dose was only about 
5-fold the clinical AUC indicating that the high dose levels were not set at an appropriate level. The 
lower in vitro potency on inhibition of phosphorylated EGFR, should also have been taken into 
consideration in the justification of dose levels. It can be argued that the high dose level employed in 
the repeat-dose studies, 120 mg/kg/week, represents the highest feasible dose level based on the 
highest available concentration of amivantamab 50 mg/mL and a dose volume of 2.4 mL/kg. The 
employed dose volume exceeds the maximum recommended volume of 2 mL/kg IV in cynomolgus 
monkeys. It is unclear if the concentration of amivantamab in the dose formulation is the highest 
feasible based on solubility. Taken together, the highest dose level employed in the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies is not considered fully justified but given that EFGR and MET are rather well 
characterised targets, and that amivantamab is indicated for treatment of patients with advanced 
cancer, no further studies are needed. 
Non-adverse effects with uncertain relation with amivantamab-treatment include findings in the GI 
tract in the 13-week study. No GI-related findings were observed in the 6-week monkey study where 
dose levels of 20, 60 and 120 mg/kg/week were used. In the 13-week monkey study, GI findings 
including liquid faeces, and gross and microscopic pathology findings were observed in some animals 
at 60 mg/kg/week and above. The observed GI findings are likely incidental. 
Liquid faeces were observed in all 4 females given amivantamab at 120 mg/kg/week, but not in male 
animals at comparable Cmax and AUC exposures. Given that the finding was observed prior to 
treatment in 2 females and only transiently in connection with dosing in the remaining 2 females, it is 
agreed that a relation to amivantamab exposure is weak. As there were no other associated changes in 
body weights, or disturbances in electrolytes, it is also agreed that the liquid faeces are considered 
non-adverse. 
Microscopically, inflammatory cell infiltration in the stomach lamina propria was observed in most 
study animals including those in the control group. This is a very common spontaneous finding in 
cynomolgus monkeys according to literature and is not considered related to amivantamab treatment. 
Additional microscopic findings include minimal mucosal/glandular epithelial degeneration/regeneration 
seen in one animal in each group at ≥60 mg/kg/week and included occasional foci of dilated gastric 
glands that contained rare sloughed necrotic epithelial cells and/or mixed neutrophilic infiltrates; 
minimal focal mucosal erosion noted in one 60 mg/kg/week group female; and focal epithelial 
basophilia/regeneration, consistent with a reparative response seen in another 60 mg/kg/week group 
male. Both findings were associated with acute haemorrhage.  
In literature, it is reported that the common spontaneous gastritis sometimes is associated with acute 
multifocal haemorrhage and erosions especially in the fundic part of the stomach. Thus, the 
haemorrhage observed in 3 males and 1 female at 60 mg/kg/week, and 1 male at 120 mg/kg/week 
may also be incidental.  
Taken together, given lack of dose-response, and the fact that most microscopic pathology findings are 
reported as spontaneous lesions in cynomolgus monkeys or were observed also in control monkeys, it 
is agreed that the findings are likely not related to amivantamab treatment. Nevertheless, GI disorders 
(i. e. constipation, stomatitis, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting) are reported as very common adverse 
reactions in SmPC 4.8 and in general, GI toxicity is considered a class effect of EGFR and MET 
inhibitors. The risk of GI toxicity in relation to EGFR or MET inhibition and the management of GI 
toxicity is well known in clinical practice. 
No developmental or reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with amivantamab. An 
evaluation of fertility is not warranted for biopharmaceuticals intended to treat advanced cancer (refer 
to Section and 4.6 of the SmPC).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 41/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding developmental toxicity, a weight-of-evidence assessment on potential consequences of 
disruption of the EGFR and MET pathways has been provided. In general, it is agreed that the risk for 
reproductive and developmental toxicity could be addressed based on published scientific evidence 
regarding mechanism of action, animal models and class effects. In addition to the EGFR inhibitors 
referred to by the Applicant, similar findings are reported for panitumumab, reported to cause foetal 
abortions and/or foetal deaths in cynomolgus monkeys when administered during the period of 
organogenesis at doses approximately equivalent to the recommended human dose (see Vectibix 
SmPC). Additionally, for cetuximab, a dose-related increased incidence of abortion was observed in 
cynomolgus monkeys (see Erbitux SmPC). Taken together, the view that the risks of amivantamab to 
human development can be communicated appropriately to patients and prescribers based on the 
existing scientific information without conducting additional developmental animal studies is agreed. 
The brief description of these findings in SmPC section 5.3 is considered adequate.  
Regarding breast-feeding, the risk for achieving plasma levels of the therapeutic antibody that would 
be sufficiently high to exert any biological activity is negligible based on the low transfer of IgG to 
human breast milk, the likely loss of biological activity in the low pH of gastric juice and the low uptake 
of intact IgG through intestinal wall. Regarding the ligands of the amivantamab targets (EGFR and Met 
receptors), literature reports that EGF and HGF growth factors, among others, are present in human 
early milk in ng/mL concentrations during the first week post-partum at concentrations much higher 
that the serum levels in lactating women or in healthy adults (about 100-fold for EGF and about 5-fold 
for HGF). It is also described that the milk levels were highest in colostrum and decreased in 
concentration in breast milk throughout lactation. Mainly based on the enrichment in milk, these 
growth factors are assumed to be important for post-natal development. In particular, it is speculated 
that EGF and HGF are important gut development and maturation. No data has been provided on 
whether the targets of amivantamab, EGFR and Met receptors, are expressed in the newborn human 
gut. In rodents, it is reported that EGF receptors have low expression during milk feeding and delayed 
expression until weaning (Gallo-Payet N, Pothier P, Hugon JS. Ontogeny of EGF receptors during 
postnatal development of mouse small intestine. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr 1987). A 
recommendation regarding breast-feeding is included in section 4.6 of the SmPC.  
No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were conducted with amivantamab as these studies are 
generally inappropriate for a monoclonal Ab, and because carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to 
support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, the available pharmacological, pharmacokinetics and toxicological 
data are considered appropriate and sufficient for approval of amivantamab for the treatment of 
NSCLC patients with EGFR Exon 20 insertions.  
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
A standard multi-tiered approach was developed including screening, confirmatory and titer and 
characterization assays (bridging ELISA format) to evaluate anti-drug antibodies in accordance with 
EMA Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of therapeutic proteins 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1). Human serum samples and controls are first treated with 
acid, followed by an incubation with biotinylated-amivantamab (bio-amivantamab). Bio-amivantamab-
ADA complexes are then captured on NeutraAvidin-coated magnetic particles and washed. The biotin-
amivantamab bound antibodies are eluted from the bead complex by a second acid treatment and 
incubated in the presence of Sulfo-TAG-amivantamab. The samples are added to the wells of the 
blocked MSD-streptavidin plate and the wells that contain antibody bound to both bio-amivantamab 
and Sulfo-TAG-amivantamab will generate an ECL signal.  
To establish screen and confirmatory assay cut points (CP), 20 normal and 25 non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) individual human serum samples were analysed. No statistically significant difference 
was found between the normal and NSCLC disease population. The assay is acceptably selective and 
sensitive (screen assay sensitivity is 2 ng/ml). Drug tolerance, defined as the highest drug 
concentration at which samples remained positive, is reported to be above 400 µg/ml for the middle 
(MPC 40 ng/ml) and high (HPC 100 ng/ml) positive control samples. For the low positive control (LPC 5 
ng/ml) drug tolerance was 100 µg/ml for the screening assay and 50 µg/ml in the confirmatory assay. 
EGFR target interference is apparent in the screen assay at levels of 31.25 ng/mL and higher when the 
dimeric form of the target is present but does not impact the confirmatory assay at levels up to 8000 
ng/mL EGFR dimeric protein. The monomeric form did not interfere with the assays at levels up to 
8000 ng/mL. cMET will cause a false positive result at concentrations above 62.5 ng/ml. 
Given the overall low incidence of anti-amivantamab antibodies in the clinical study (3 subjects or 1%) 
no assay for determining the neutralising potential of ADAs were developed. 
Quantification of free and total soluble EGFR and Met in human serum 
Sandwich MSD ECLIA methods were developed and qualified to measure engagement of amivantamab 
with soluble EGFR and MET targets at the different dose levels in study EDI1001. 
Non-compartment data analysis (NCA) 
Standard non-compartment analysis was performed where rich sampling was applied. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
A population PK (PPK) analysis was performed using the nonlinear mixed-effects modelling software 
NONMEM, version 7.3. The FOCEI method was employed for all model runs. 
The PPK analysis was based on 13440 rich and sparse serum concentration samples from 413 subjects, 
with advanced NSCLC receiving IV amivantamab as monotherapy, in Study EDI1001 (Part 1: dose 
escalation; Part 2: dose expansion). Rich individual serum concentration-time data are shown in Figure 
3.

Figure 1. Amivantamab Serum Concentration Profiles in Cycles 1, 2, and 4. 
A faster decline was observed for the 140 mg dose group compared with the other dose groups, which 
is consistent with the notion of amivantamab undergoing target-mediated drug disposition. The PK of 
amivantamab appeared to be dose-proportional in the dose range of 350 to 1750 mg. 
A 2-compartment model significantly improved the model fit compared with a 1-compartment model. A 
parallel linear and saturable (ie, Michaelis-Menten) clearance mechanism further improved the model 
fit compared with linear clearance.  Body weight was included as covariate on clearance (CL) and 
central volume of distribution (V1) [allometric scaling with estimated exponents], whereas sex was 
included on CL [these were the key covariate effects identified for amivantamab PK in the original 
analysis with a linear clearance model – not reassessed with the parallel linear and saturable clearance 
model]. Based on the parameter estimates of the updated final PPK model, a 50% increase in body 
weight (e.g., from 60 to 90 kg) results in a 20% increase in linear clearance (irrespective of sex) and a 
31% increase in V1, while males are associated with a 23% higher linear clearance compared with 
females (irrespective of body weight). 
The prediction-corrected VPC (pcVPC) of predose and postdose concentrations, stratified by 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) status, for the PPK final model, is shown in Figure 4. Other time 
points (2, 6, 24, 72, 168, and 240 hours postdose) all had fewer than 100 observations at each cycle 
and were therefore not included in the plot. Based on the pcVPC plots, the PPK final model appeared to 
adequately capture the central tendency and the variability of the data.

concentration at steady state]), derived from the individual PPK final model parameters and assuming 
RP2D regimen, are summarized in Table 11. Exposures for body weights <80 kg (resulting from the 
RP2D of 1050 mg) and ≥80 kg (resulting from the RP2D of 1400 mg) were comparable.

80% to 125% range. This confirms that for all covariates, amivantamab exposures with the RP2D 
regimen were similar across different strata of the covariate when adjusted for the effect of other 
covariates.

Absorption  
Absorption data are not available since all studies administered amivantamab as an IV infusion and no 
food effect study was conducted. 
Bioequivalence 
Clinical Study EDI1001 used 150mg/vial and 350mg/vial formulations of amivantamab for dilution for 
intravenous administration. The 350mg/vial formulation is identical to the proposed commercial 
formulation. Further several different batches of amivantamab were used in the clinical trial. A 
comprehensive overview of the formulation development process along with the formulation 
development as well as a discussion of the impact of changes implemented throughout development of 
the drug substance and drug product manufacturing processes are provided in the quality sections of 
the dossier. 
Distribution 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 48/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Typical IgG1-based mAbs are primarily confined in the vascular system. The geometric mean (CV%) 
total volume of distribution, based on individual parameter estimates from the PPK model, was 5.37 
(20.6%) L. Traditional protein-binding studies using human serum albumin as conducted for small 
molecules are not applicable to mAbs. 
Elimination 
The excretion and metabolic pathways of amivantamab has not been investigated. As an IgG1 
antibody, the biotransformation of amivantamab is expected to be similar to endogenous IgG 
(degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways) and subject to similar 
elimination pathways. For a 148 kDa protein renal excretion is not anticipated. 
The PPK model-estimated nonspecific linear clearance of amivantamab was 225 mL/day (with inter-
individual variability [CV%] of 25%). The geometric mean (CV%) half-life of amivantamab associated 
with linear elimination, derived based on individual parameter estimates from the PPK model, was 15.7 
(25.5%) days. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Target-mediated drug disposition was apparent at the lowest dose (140 mg) and in the first cycle also 
for doses up to 700 mg. Based on AUC0-168h, Cmax and Ctrough dose proportionality was observed in the 
amivantamab dose range of 350 to 1750 mg. No data from NCA comparing the different doses at 
steady state (achieved by the ninth infusion) is available. 
Time dependency 
The increase in Ctrough during weekly dosing in Cycle 1 demonstrates moderate accumulation of 
amivantamab. The mean (SD) accumulation ratios (AR)s of amivantamab based on AUC0-168 h 
(C2D1/C1D1) at 1050 mg (for body weight <80 kg) and 1400 mg (for body weight ≥80 kg) were 2.88 
(0.68) and 3.03 (0.82), respectively. The mean (SD) AR of amivantamab at steady state based on 
AUC0-168h (C4D1/C1D1) at 1050 mg was 2.44 (0.54). 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual variability (CV%) in CL, Vmax (maximum velocity of the Michaelis-Menten elimination 
process), V1 and V2 was estimated to be 25%, 55%, 25% and 36%, respectively, based on PPK model 
estimates. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The PK analyses are based on serum amivantamab concentrations of samples obtained from subjects 
treated with amivantamab monotherapy in Parts 1 and 2 of Study EDI1001 which is an ongoing, first-
in-human, open-label, 2-part Phase1 dose escalation study. 
The primary objective of Part 1 was to determine the maximal tolerable dose, if one exists and the 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). 76 subjects were allocated to amivantamab doses of 140, 350, 
700, 1050, 1400, and 1750 mg were administered as IV infusion, once weekly for the first 4 weeks (ie, 
Cycle 1) and every 2 weeks thereafter in all subsequent 4-week cycles. Rich sampling was applied at 
day 1 in Cycle 1 and 2 in addition to sparse sampling throughout the study period.  
The primary objectives of Part2 (n=285) were to determine the safety, tolerability, and antitumor 
activity of amivantamab monotherapy at the RP2D which was 1050 mg for subjects <80 kg body 
weight (at baseline) or 1400 mg for subjects ≥80 kg body weight (at baseline), administered as an IV 
infusion once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks thereafter. The first Cycle 1 dose was split over 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021

2 days to better manage the risk of IRRs. Apart from rich sampling in 6 individuals (dosed 1050 mg) at 
day 1 in cycle 1,2 and 4 sparse sampling was applied.

kg (applied in the RP2D regimen), Table 13 was provided, presenting observed Ctrough at Cycle 2 Day 1

Special populations 
Variations in renal and hepatic function or drug-metabolizing enzymes are not expected to affect the 
elimination of amivantamab. No dedicated formal intrinsic factor PK studies have been conducted. 
Demographic factors and the effect of organ dysfunction was investigated in the population PK 
analysis. Based on this no dose adjustments are proposed for patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment or for patients with mild hepatic impairment or based on age, gender and race. 
Amivantamab was not studied in children and is not intended for use in children.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were performed with amivantamab. As an antibody that 
binds to the ECDs of EGFR and MET with high specificity, amivantamab is also not anticipated to alter 
the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes. In addition, amivantamab is not a modulator of cytokines 
that have known effects on CYPs and transporters.  
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical studies investigating the mechanism of action have been conducted. The information is 
derived from non-clinical studies. 
Amivantamab is an EGFR and MET receptor bispecific antibody. Three potential mechanisms of action 
for amivantamab to inhibit tumours with aberrant EGFR and MET signalling are proposed: 1) inhibition 
of ligand-dependent signalling, 2) downregulation of EGFR and MET levels from cell surface, and 3) 
initiation of ADCC and/or ADCT.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
An exploratory PD assessment was one of the objectives of the Study EDI1001. Soluble EGFR and MET 
target engagement was used as a surrogate for evaluating whole body engagement and was assessed 
by measuring free and total soluble targets. Mean serum concentrations of free EGFR and free MET 
were highest at baseline and significantly reduced after the EOI on C1D1 and remained at similar levels 
at all subsequent time points for all dose cohorts with the exception to concentrations of free EGFR at 
140 mg dose which tended to return to baseline at the predose time points. Saturation of free soluble 
EGFR and soluble MET with amivantamab was observed at doses ≥350 mg and ≥140 mg, respectively. 
Complete saturation (i.e., depletion of free targets) of circulating EGFR throughout the dosing interval 
was achieved at dose levels ≥700 mg, while the complete saturation of soluble free MET was achieved 
at all dose levels tested 
Exposure-response analysis 
The purpose of the analysis was to explore E-R to corroborate and supplement the evidence of efficacy 
and safety of amivantamab in subjects with NSCLC and to confirm the selected dosing regimen. 
Efficacy endpoints investigated were ORR (primary endpoint), CBR, DOR, and PFS, and the exposure 
metrics derived for the E-R analyses of efficacy (generated by simulation using the individual PK 
parameter estimates and the actual dosing information for each subject) were Ctrough,1st [trough 
concentration after the first dose in Cycle 1] and Ctrough,max [maximum trough concentration – usually 
corresponding to trough concentration prior to the first dose in Cycle 2]. In the updated analysis, 
cumulative AUC in Cycle 1 (AUCcycle1) was investigated as exposure used to drive E-R analysis on ORR. 
Safety analyses (visual exploration) for TEAEs were initially conducted using individual predictions of 
Ceoi,max [maximum concentration at end-of-infusion – usually corresponding to concentration at end-of-
infusion after the first dose in Cycle 2], but were also repeated using Cav [average amivantamab 
concentration during treatment, i.e., from the first amivantamab dose to the last PK sampling or 
dosing time, whichever comes last]. 
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects included in the data set for E-R analyses 
(ie, subjects with EGFR Exon 20ins NSCLC who received the first amivantamab dose on or before 05 
February 2020) are summarised in Table 14 [updated table not available].

Table 9. Summary of Subject Demographic and Baseline Characteristics in E-R Analysis for 
Efficacy 
Binary response variables (ORR and CBR) were evaluated by logistic regression, analysed using R 
version 3.4.1 (The R Project for Statistical Computing, [www.r-project.org]) and Stan (Carpenter 
2017), as called by the R package rstan, version 2.19.2. The E-R relationship was described by a 
sigmoidal Emax model. Since there was no placebo information in the current E-R dataset, the covariate 
effects were added on the baseline probability but not Emax. The full covariate model included a set of 
preselected covariates of clinical interest (age, weight, time from metastatic diagnosis to first dose 
[months], sex, race [Asian vs non-Asian], baseline ECOG [1 or 2 vs 0], and prior chemotherapy [yes 
vs no]). Based on the statistical significance criteria (90% credible interval of regression coefficient for 
a specific covariate excluding zero), the reduced full model was established to keep the statistically 
significant covariates, which was regarded as the final model. 
Time-to-event variables (DOR and PFS) were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier (K-M) plots, stratified by 
exposure group (tertile of the relevant exposure metrics). 
The E-R relationship was explored for selected AEs of clinical interest including infusion-related 
reactions (IRR) and rash. The AEs were stratified by the appropriate exposure metrics to evaluate 
whether there is a relationship between the AEs and exposure to amivantamab. 
Objective Response rate 
In the updated analysis, none of the tested covariates was statistically significant. The relationships 
between ORR and amivantamab Ctrough.max, and ORR and amivantamab AUCcycle1, indicate a slight trend 
of ORR increase with increase of amivantamab exposure, approaching Emax at the high end of the

concentration range (Figure 7). A correlation between ORR and amivantamab Ctrough.1st was not evident 
[figure not included in AR].

The results from the updated analysis were consistent with those in the initial submission. Specifically, 
the probability of response for subjects with ECOG performance status of 1 or 2 at baseline seemed to 
be lower than for subjects with ECOG performance status of 0, however, this difference was not 
statistically significant in the updated E-R efficacy analysis with more subjects in the dataset and 
exposure predicted based on the parallel linear and saturable clearance PPK model (the proportion of 
ECOG 0 subjects was higher at the RP2D of 1400 mg than at the RP2D of 1050 mg [59.1% vs 25.6%; 
Table 14]). 
The purpose of the analysis was to explore E-R to corroborate and supplement the evidence of efficacy 
and safety of amivantamab in subjects with NSCLC and to confirm the selected dosing regimen. 
Efficacy endpoints investigated were ORR (primary endpoint), CBR, DOR, and PFS, and the exposure 
metrics derived for the E-R analyses of efficacy (generated by simulation using the individual PK 
parameter estimates and the actual dosing information for each subject) were Ctrough,1st [trough 
concentration after the first dose in Cycle 1] and Ctrough,max [maximum trough concentration – usually 
corresponding to trough concentration prior to the first dose in Cycle 2]. In the updated analysis, 
cumulative AUC in Cycle 1 (AUCcycle1) was investigated as exposure used to drive E-R analysis on 
ORR. Safety analyses (visual exploration) for TEAEs were initially conducted using individual 
predictions of Ceoi,max [maximum concentration at end-of-infusion – usually corresponding to 
concentration at end-of-infusion after the first dose in Cycle 2], but were also repeated using Cav 
[average amivantamab concentration during treatment, i.e., from the first amivantamab dose to the 
last PK sampling or dosing time, whichever comes last]. 
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects included in the data set for E-R analyses 
(ie, subjects with EGFR Exon 20ins NSCLC who received the first amivantamab dose on or before 05 
February 2020) are summarised in Table 14 [updated table not available]. 
Clinical Benefit Rate 
Exploratory logistic regression analysis was applied to link logit-transformed probability of CBR to 
amivantamab Ctrough.max and Ctrough.1st with Emax relationship. This analysis demonstrated a flat E-R 
relationship between CBR and the amivantamab exposure metrics at the tested amivantamab doses in 
Study EDI1001 [figures not included in AR; not repeated in updated analysis]. 
Progression-Free Survival 
Progression-free survival appeared to improve when amivantamab systemic exposure increased. 
However, a flat E-R relationship could not be ruled out due to significant overlap of 95% CI bands 
around the K-M curves between subject groups at different tertiles of amivantamab systemic exposure 
[figures not included in AR; not repeated in updated analysis]. 
Overall Survival 
A definitive conclusion could not be drawn for the E-R relationship between OS and amivantamab 
exposure metrics due to the limited number of events (ie, death) within the current follow-up period 
and crossover of K-M plots in the current dataset [figures not included in AR; not repeated in updated 
analysis]. 
Duration of Response 
A longer DOR appeared to be associated with higher amivantamab exposure. Since the number of 
subjects was small (n<20 in each tertile of amivantamab exposure metrics), in association with largely 
overlapping 95% CIs of K-M plots, a definite E-R relationship could not be drawn [figures not included 
in AR; not repeated in updated analysis].

Selected Adverse Events 
No apparent relationship between amivantamab exposure and treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs; IRR, nausea, and constipation) was identified at the studied amivantamab concentrations, 
except a somewhat higher incidence rate of IRRs in subjects in the 1st quartile of Ceoi.1st compared with 
the rate in subjects in the subsequent quartiles; likely due to the lack of risk mitigation strategies for 
IRR at the beginning of the study. The incidence rates of rash, paronychia, and hypoalbuminemia 
increased slightly with the increase of amivantamab Ceoi.max, which were likely related to the 
mechanism of action of EGFR and MET inhibition. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Amivantamab is a first-in-class, fully human IgG1-based, bispecific antibody which simultaneously 
targets both the EGFR and MET pathways by binding to the extracellular domain (ECD) of each 
receptor. The PK-information in this submission is based on a single ongoing study in subjects with 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer, including subjects with EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations. No 
clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers have been provided. A limited number of 
individuals had dense PK-sampling, especially at steady state, and were included in the non-
compartmental analysis (NCA). Typical PK-parameters such as AUCinf, t½ and Cl were not estimated 
using NCA. The distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics of amivantamab are based on 
population PK model-estimated parameters.  
Amivantamab was provided for clinical studies as 150 mg/vial and 350 mg/vial formulations for dilution 
for IV administration. No BE-study has been provided comparing the different formulations and 
processes, which is acceptable.  
An adequately validated ECLIA assay on the MSD platform was used to analyse total amivantamab 
concentrations in human serum. Results from within study validation show that the assay performed 
adequately. 
The immunogenicity of amivantamab was evaluated in the clinical study. For this purpose, a standard 
multi-tiered approach was used, including screening, confirmatory and titer and characterization 
assays (bridging ELISA format), to evaluate anti-drug antibodies. Overall, the method appears 
appropriately validated. 25 individuals from the clinical study had samples with amivantamab-
concentrations above drug-tolerance limits and have been classified with ADA-status inconclusive. In a 
worst-case scenario, all of these could be ADA-positive. Therefore, the clinical relevance of this was 
analysed, i.e. if PK, efficacy or safety is affected in subjects with inconclusive ADA-status. While the 
available data limited the efficacy analysis, no alarming trends were detected for safety and PK in 
subjects with inconclusive ADA-status. 
Target mediated drug disposition was apparent at the lowest dose of 140 mg and in the first cycle for 
doses up to 700 mg. However, the nonlinear clearance is saturated at the proposed clinical doses. 
Dose proportionality was indicated in the dose range of 350 to 1750 mg, though no NCA data was 
provided comparing the different doses at steady state (achieved by the ninth infusion). After weekly 
administrations during the first cycle (28 days) the accumulation ratio (AR) for AUC1week is close to 3. 
The Accumulation ratio at steady state was 2.44. This is based on the PK-data from 6 individuals all in 
the 1050 mg dose cohort.  
In the target population, pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Ctrough, AUC0-168h and AUCτ) following IV 
infusion of amivantamab at 1050 mg and 1400 mg were approximately 30% to 40% lower in those 
subjects with body weight ≥80 kg compared to those with body weight <80 kg. From the limited NCA-
data presented in Table 12, the proposed weight-based dose regime appears to provide similar Ctrough 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 57/144 
 
 
 
 
 
for the two weight-groups while there still are some differences in AUC and Cmax, especially at C2D1. 
However, Table 13 indicates that subjects with body weight <70 kg, and subjects with body weight 
≥80 kg, achieve similar Ctrough at C2D1, whereas subjects with body weight ≥70 and <80 kg achieve a 
lower Ctrough, when dosed according to the RP2D regimen (further discussed below). There are only 
NCA-data for Ctorugh available for comparison at steady state. The population PK model has been used 
to compare the AUC, Cmax and Ctrough at steady state for the suggested RP2D body weight-groups (<80 
kg receiving 1050 mg and ≥80 kg receiving 1400 mg); however, the covariate model is not considered 
fully adequate, which hampers the comparison [further discussed below]. 
The developed population PK model for amivantamab has been used to characterize amivantamab PK 
in NSCLC subjects, to assess the impact of potential covariate effects, to support the proposed weight-
based posology, and to calculate exposure metrics, based on individual parameter estimates, 
subsequently used in the exposure-response (E-R) analysis. The model was updated to account for the 
observed nonlinear kinetics (due to TMDD). However, the covariate modelling was not repeated for the 
updated model, and trends are noted in the goodness-of-fit plots for individual parameter estimates 
vs. covariates [Figures not included in AR], both for body weight (volume of peripheral compartment) 
and for sex (volumes of central and peripheral compartments), indicating a suboptimal covariate 
model. The pcVPCs reveal a minor but consistent under-prediction of the median, especially around 
Cmax for the first dose in Cycle 1 and the first dose in Cycle 2. Despite these shortcomings, the model is 
considered to provide an acceptable prediction at steady state, especially for the RP2D regimen (Figure 
4) and hence the current model can be used to provide information on amivantamab’s PK (for the 
RP2D regimen) in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Subjects in the lower body weight categories (<60 kg, and ≥60 and <70 kg, receiving a dose of 1050 
mg) and subjects in the higher body weight category (≥80 kg, receiving a dose of 1400 mg) achieved 
similar Ctrough, whereas subjects in the middle body weight category (≥70 and <80 kg, receiving a dose 
of 1050 mg) achieved a lower Ctrough. The preclinical target exposure was 110-168 µg/mL (established 
based on the least sensitive lung adenocarcinoma mouse xenograft model), and hence the majority of 
subjects – also those with a body weight ≥70 and <80 kg – achieved exposures that are within or 
above the preclinically established target exposure, when treated according to the RP2D regimen. 
Furthermore, the objective response rate (ORR) per body weight group, for subjects receiving doses 
according to RP2D regimen, shows that there is no decrease in ORR with increasing body weight (data 
not shown) – i.e., there is no indication of under-exposure of subjects weighing ≥70 and <80 kg in 
terms of ORR. It was therefore concluded that an increase of the exposure, for subjects with a body 
weight ≥70 and <80 kg (e.g., by lowering the body weight dosing cut-off), is unlikely to result in a 
clinical benefit (see further assessment under 2.6.5 Clinical efficacy). 
No dedicated studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab in 
special populations, which is considered acceptable for a monoclonal antibody. 
No drug interaction studies have been performed. The Applicant has provided a sufficient justification 
that amivantamab is not an immunomodulator hence the absence of interaction studies is acceptable. 
Pharmacodynamics and PK/PD 
Study EDI1001 involved exploratory PD assessment, which was based on the measurement of free and 
total soluble EGFR and MET targets. The Applicant was asked to perform target engagement analysis by 
combining data from subjects treated at RP2D in Part 1 and Part 2. In response to that the applicant 
provided free EGFR and free MET profiles at RP2D for 53 subjects out of 60. As this analysis represents 
the majority (~85%) of RP2D population it can be expected that the remaining missing samples would 
not essentially change the target engagement profile and can be seen as showing the consistent 
suppression of both free MET and free EGFR serum concentrations at C1D6 and later throughout the 
therapy. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 58/144 
 
 
 
 
 
The purpose of the E-R analysis was to supplement the evidence of efficacy and safety of amivantamab, 
and support the dose selection in subjects with NSCLC. It is noted that the number of subjects, and the 
dose range (and hence exposure range) explored, is limited, and this will compromise the validity of the 
analysis. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK-information in this submission is based on a single ongoing study in subjects with advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer. Mainly sparse sampling and population PK modelling has been applied to 
characterize the basic ADME of amivantamab. Despite the limitations, the provided clinical 
pharmacology data are considered sufficient for the approval of amivantamab for the treatment of 
NSCLC patients with EGFR Exon 20 insertions. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The market authorisation application rests upon data from a selected subset of patients in the Phase 1 
study, Protocol 61186372EDI1001 (CHRYSALIS), referred to as Study EDI1001.  
Study EDI1001 is an ongoing Phase 1 first-in-human (FIH) open-label study that includes both dose 
escalation and dose expansion phases, and both monotherapy and combination therapy regimens 
(Table 10).  
The combination regimens include combination with the investigational third-generation epidermal 
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor lazertinib (Part 1 and Part 2 cohorts), and combination 
with standard of care carboplatin and pemetrexed (Part 1 only). Further information about, and data 
from, the amivantamab combination therapy cohorts are not presented in this submission. 
The monotherapy cohorts are presented in Table 15. 
The study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, including the archival of essential 
documents.

2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Study EDI1001 (CHRYSALIS) – Part 1 – dose escalation 
Study EDI1001 is an ongoing, first-in-human phase 1, open-label, multicentre study of amivantamab 
as monotherapy being conducted globally in subjects of at least 18 years of age with advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC.  
The study consisted of 2 parts: a dose escalation phase (Part 1, n=77) to determine the RP2D of 
amivantamab monotherapy in subjects with advanced or metastatic NSCLC; and a dose expansion 
phase (Part 2, n=285) to better characterize the safety and pharmacokinetics of amivantamab 
monotherapy at the RP2D and to explore its clinical activity within molecularly-defined tumour 
subgroups (Figure 8). Part 2 is further described under Main study below. 
Figure 6. Design of Study 61186372EDI1001: Monotherapy Cohorts 
Source: CSR, Figure 1. (SCE, Figure 2) 
Part 1 was designed to determine the RP2D of amivantamab monotherapy in subjects with advanced 
NSCLC based on safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and anti-tumour activity data. 
Part 1 started with a standard 3+3 design. Dose escalation was to stop when the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) (in case no MTD is determined) was reached. 
Study participants 
Subjects enrolled to Part 1 were not required to meet any molecular eligibility requirements. However, 
the majority of subjects (66 of 77; 86%) in Part 1 of Study EDI1001 were previously diagnosed with 
EGFR-mutated NSCLC. 
Primary Objective 
Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if one existed (Part 1 monotherapy dose escalation 
only), and the RP2D for subjects with NSCLC treated with amivantamab.

Baseline characteristics  
Subjects treated in Part 1 had a median age of 63 years (42% ≥ 65 years) and there were more 
women (64%) than men (36%). Race was 62% Asian, 34% White, and 4% Black/African American. 
ECOG performance status was 0 in 29% and 1 in 71%. 40% had a history of smoking. 95% of subjects 
had adenocarcinoma, the median number of lines of prior therapy was 3 (range: 0-10). 
Treatments 
Amivantamab was administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion once weekly for 4 weeks (Cycle 1) 
then every 2 weeks thereafter during subsequent cycles.  
Doses of 140 mg to 1750 mg were investigated, using the following dose cohorts:  
140 mg (n=3), 350 mg (n=3), 700 mg (n=14), 1050 mg (n=25), 1400 mg (n=26), and 1750 mg 
(n=6). The 1750 mg dose cohort was added after recommendation from the safety evaluation team 
(SET) for further dose escalation (Amendment 4, March 2018). In total 77 patients were included in 
Part 1. 
Disposition 
Of the 77 subjects treated with amivantamab monotherapy in Part 1, 24 (31.2%) remained on study 
and 11 (14.3%) remained on treatment as of the clinical cut-off. The median duration of follow-up 
across all treated subjects in Part 1 was 7.6 months (range: 0.07-33.6).  
The main reason for discontinuation of treatment was progressive disease. Few subjects discontinued 
treatment for withdrawal of consent (7.8%). Six subjects (7.8%) were identified on the study 
disposition page of the CRF as discontinuing treatment due to AEs (pneumonia in 2 subjects, and 1 
subject each for IRR and musculoskeletal chest pain, myalgia, paronychia, stomatitis).

EDI1001  
a Subject is considered to have completed the study if the subject died prior to the end of study. 
Source: CSR, Table 4. (DCO 08 June 2020) 
A larger proportion of patients in the highest dose group was ongoing at the data cut-off together with 
a lower frequency of treatment discontinuation due to progressive disease (PD) (Table 16). It is not 
clear to which degree this is caused by a later inclusion in the highest dose group. It is also noted that 
the median duration of study treatment was numerically higher in the (earlier) 1050 mg dose cohort

(5.1 months) compared to the 1400 mg and 1750 mg dose cohorts (3.7 and 4.4 months, respectively). 
This could similarly potentially be due to different recruitment periods. 
Anti-tumour activity 
As of the clinical cut-off, 08 June 2020, 76 of the 77 subjects treated in Part 1 were included in the 
efficacy analysis set for this study phase. One subject in the 1750 mg cohort was not included in the 
efficacy analysis set for Part 1 as the subject was enrolled <1 month prior to the clinical cut-off date. 
Furthermore, 1 subject in the 1050 mg cohort did not have measurable disease and therefore, 75 
subjects were response evaluable. 
Confirmed partial responses (PR) per RECIST v.1.1 were observed for 14 subjects in Part 1; no 
complete responses (CR) were observed, giving an ORR of 18.7% (95% CI: 10.6%, 29.3%). A best 
response of durable SD (i.e., SD for at least 11 weeks) was observed for 22 subjects in Part 1, 
contributing to an overall clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 48.0% (95% CI: 36.3%, 59.8%). 
Similar response rates around 20% were observed in the 4 dose cohorts (700-1750 mg) where 
objective responses were observed (Table 17). Amivantamab doses <700 mg were not associated with 
a response in Part 1, with no subject in the 140 mg or 350 mg dose cohorts having a confirmed 
response and 1 subject in the 350 mg cohort having durable SD (Table 17).

The waterfall plot in Figure 9 shows the maximum percentage change in target lesion size, sum of 
diameters (SoD), for the 66 subjects in the Part 1 efficacy population with available data. Eighteen 
(27%) of these subjects had tumour shrinkage of ≥ 30%.

– Investigator assessment; Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set in Part 1 (DCO 08 June 2020) 
RP2D (recommended phase 2 dose): 1050 mg if baseline weight <80 kg and 1400 mg if baseline weight >= 80 kg. Key: SoD = Sum of Diameters. 
While keeping in mind the small dose cohorts and the fact that the patients in Part 1 were molecularly 
unselected, based on the waterfall plot, there is no strong trend for improved efficacy with doses 
higher than the chosen RP2D of 1050 mg. Responses were observed despite a molecularly unselected 
population.  
Only 66 out of the 75 patients with measurable disease and sufficient follow-up in Part 1 of study were 
evaluable for tumour response, the other 9 had discontinued therapy prior to their first disease 
assessment. They were, however, included in the efficacy analyses. Five of the 9 patients discontinued 
due to AE, and 4 due to withdrawal of consent by the subject.  
Dose-limiting Toxicity and Maximum Tolerated Dose 
Only one AE meeting the DLT criteria was observed in the 77 patients treated with amivantamab 
monotherapy as of the clinical cut-off date. 
This consisted of a Grade 3 toxicity of myalgia in a US subject in the 1050 mg dose cohort. The 
myalgia occurred on Day 5, 3 days after receiving the Cycle 1, Day 2 infusion. Treatment with 
amivantamab was discontinued due to this TEAE, although the subject remained in the study.  
Thus, the MTD (defined as highest dose level at which <33% of subjects treated at that level 
experienced a DLT) for amivantamab as monotherapy was not established. The MAD for amivantamab 
monotherapy in Part 1 was 1750 mg. 
The 1050 mg dose of amivantamab as monotherapy was identified as the first RP2D to be explored 
in Part 2 on the basis of available safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic data. Additional analyses of 
available pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety, and efficacy data from subjects treated in Part 1 
and Part 2 led to a modification of the RP2D for amivantamab as monotherapy to 1050 mg for 
subjects <80 kg body weight and 1400 mg for subjects ≥80 kg body weight, at a regimen of once 
weekly for Cycle 1 and every 2 weeks for Cycle 2 and beyond (28-day cycles). Dosing was split for the 
first treatment in Cycle 1 to better manage the risk of IRRs; 350 mg was administered on Day 1 and 
700 mg (for body weight <80 mg) or 1050 mg (for body weight ≥80 kg) was administered on Day 2. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 65/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The input contributing to the final RP2D included among other things population-pharmacokinetic 
analyses with data from 80 subjects (46 from Part 1; 34 from Part 2) and for exposure-response (E-R) 
analysis from 63 subjects. This is further described in the PK section. 
Furthermore, the 1750 mg cohort was added to Part 1 with protocol Amendment 4 (March 2018); the 
first dose of treatment in the 1750 mg cohort given on 29 January 2019.  
Results of additional analyses conducted in August 2019 which included 32 subjects with Exon 
20ins NSCLC treated with amivantamab 1050 mg (n=16) or 1400 mg (n=16) upheld the earlier 
preliminary results and showed a flat exposure response relationship for TEAEs at doses >700 mg and 
complete soluble target saturation throughout dosing at doses ≥700 mg.  
Efficacy data from Part 1 and Part 2 of Study EDI1001 relevant to dosing recommendations 
Based on investigator-based response data from patients on RP2D and non-RP2D, the group of 
patients weighing < 80 kg who received the 1050 mg dose had a numerically lower ORR (35%) than 
patients who received the 1400 mg dose, weighing < 80 kg (42%) and ≥ 80 kg (45%), respectively. 
This raised concern that heavier patients in the < 80 kg group might be underdosed. However, based 
on analyses of patients on RP2D, ORR results showed no trend towards decreased ORRs as a function 
of increasing weight, within subjects weighing <80kg at RP2D dose (1050 mg).

See information on Part 1 of the study above. Based on the activity observed in the Part 1 dose 
escalation, the Part 2 cohort expansion was modified through an amendment to allow assessment of 
amivantamab activity in 4 different NSCLC patient populations with unmet medical need. 
The dose expansion phase (Part 2) of Study EDI1001 currently consists of 6 cohorts investigating the 
efficacy and safety of treatment with amivantamab monotherapy in subjects with locally advanced or 
metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC (EGFR Exon 20ins, third-generation TKI resistance mutations, and 
MET amplification or mutations).  
The efficacy and safety data for subjects with Exon 20ins NSCLC are analysed according to exposure to 
prior platinum-based therapy for NSCLC and RP2D treatment status (i.e., subjects receiving 1050 mg 
dose with a baseline body weight of <80 kg plus subjects receiving 1400 mg dose with a baseline body 
weight of >80 kg) (Figure 10). 
• 
The primary population of interest includes the 114 subjects with Exon 20ins NSCLC treated at 
the RP2D who had progressed on or after prior platinum chemotherapy, of which 81 subjects 
met the criteria for inclusion in the efficacy analysis set, having received their first dose on or 
before 05 FEB 2020, at the initially submitted data cut-offs, 08 June 2020, and 08 October 
2020. This population of 81 subjects is hereafter referred to as the initial primary efficacy 
population. During the marketing authorisation application procedure, data were provided for 
a later cut-off, 30 March 2021, for which all 114 subjects fulfilled the criteria for follow-up, 
having received their first dose on or before 04 June 2020. This population of 114 patients is

hereafter referred to as the extended primary efficacy population and considered the 
pivotal data set. 
• 
In addition, supportive efficacy results in subjects with Exon 20ins NSCLC treated at RP2D who 
had not received prior platinum-containing chemotherapy (N=24), and subjects with Exon 
20ins NSCLC treated at Non-RP2D doses (N=42) are briefly summarized.

Methods 
•  Study Participants  
According to protocol amendments several of the key inclusion criteria have been amended more than 
once during the study.  
According to the final eligibility criteria, subjects were required to have histologically or cytologically 
confirmed NSCLC that was metastatic or unresectable and must have either progressed after prior 
standard of care therapy for metastatic disease, be ineligible for, or have refused all other currently 
available therapeutic options.  
Performance status of ECOG 0-1 and acceptable organ and bone marrow function according to 
stipulated laboratory criteria was required. Exclusion criteria concerned uncontrolled brain metastases 
and history of ILD. See further details below. 
Identification of EGFR-mutated disease for the assignment to the key efficacy Cohort D, as well as 
efficacy-contributing Cohort A, was based on a variety of local test results from archival or biopsy 
tumour tissue or ctDNA from plasma (see baseline data below). 
Key eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study: 
•  ≥18 years of age. 
•  Have histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC that was metastatic or unresectable. 
Subjects must have either progressed after prior standard of care therapy (e.g., Cohort C and 
MET-1: EGFR TKI; Cohort D and MET-2: platinum-based chemotherapy) for metastatic disease, 
be ineligible for, or have refused all other currently available therapeutic options.

−  Treatment with prior chemotherapy, targeted cancer therapy, immunotherapy, or 
treatment with an investigational anti-cancer agent must have been stopped within 2 
weeks or 4 half-lives (whichever was longer) before the first administration of study 
drug. For agents with long half-lives, the maximum required time since last dose to the 
start of study drug was 4 weeks. Further, toxicities from previous anti-cancer therapies 
were to have been resolved to baseline levels or to Grade 1 or less, (except for 
alopecia [any grade], Grade ≤2 peripheral neuropathy, and Grade <2 hypothyroidism 
stable on hormone replacement). 
• 
For Part 2 only, have disease with a previously-diagnosed activating EGFR mutation (included 
both inhibitor sensitive primary mutations such as Exon 19 deletion and L858R [Cohorts C and 
MET-1], as well as marketed TKI-resistant mutations such as Exon 20ins [Cohorts C, D, and 
MET-1], or activating MET Exon 14 skipping mutation [Cohort MET-2]). Documentation of 
primary activating EGFR or MET mutation eligibility by Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendment-certified laboratory (or equivalent) testing was required. Note: in Part 2, subjects 
were assigned to cohorts on the basis of tissue or blood sample NGS analysis submitted during 
Screening, or on the basis of previous local testing.  
Specifically: 
−  Cohorts A and B: Recent progression of EGFR-mutated disease following treatment 
with a marketed EGFR inhibitor, with the exception for subjects diagnosed with 
mutations associated with de novo EGFR inhibitor resistance (e.g., Exon 20ins) where 
only previous treatment with combination platinum-based chemotherapy was required. 
The inclusion criteria for Cohort A thus allowed inclusion of patients with EGFR T790M+ 
disease after prior first- or second-generation TKI, or EGFR C797S+ disease after prior 
third-generation TKI, as well as for patients with EGFR Exon 20ins disease. 
Identification of EGFR-mutated disease for Cohort A or B assignment was based on 
local circulating tumour deoxyribose nucleic acid (ctDNA) or tumour NGS.  
−  Cohort C: Primary EGFR mutated disease, with a documented EGFR alteration (e.g., 
C797S) mediating resistance to previous treatment with a third generation EGFR TKI 
(e.g., osimertinib). In the case of primary Exon20ins disease, the documented EGFR 
alteration could have arisen following treatment with a TKI with known activity against 
Exon 20ins disease (e.g. poziotinib). Cohort C assignment was based on identification 
of EGFR resistance mutation (e.g., C797S) by any of the following: central tumour 
NGS, local NGS, central ctDNA, or local ctDNA. 
−  Cohort D: EGFR Exon20ins mutation not been previously treated with a TKI with known 
activity against Exon20ins disease (e.g., poziotinib). Identification of EGFR-mutated 
disease for Cohort D assignment was based on local test results (tumour or ctDNA). 
−  Cohort MET-1: Documented primary EGFR mutated disease and documented MET 
amplification or MET mutation after progression on any EGFR TKI. Subjects in this 
cohort could have received or have been intolerant to prior platinum-based 
chemotherapy.MET-1 assignment was based on identification of 3 or more copies of 
MET as detected by any of the following: local fluorescence in situ hybridization, local 
tumour NGS; or central tumour NGS. 
−  Cohort MET-2: Documented primary MET Exon 14 skipping mutation. Identification of 
MET Exon 14 skipping mutation was detected by any of the following: central tumour 
NGS, local tumour NGS, local ctDNA, or central ctDNA.

•  Have evaluable disease (Part 1) or measurable disease according to Response Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 (Part 2). 
•  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 
•  Subject must have organ and bone marrow function as follows: 
•  A number of criteria ensuring non-pregnant state and pregnancy prevention for women and 
men. 
•  Subjects eligible for Part 2 must agree to the pre-treatment tumour biopsy (or submission of 
equivalent archival material) and a tumour biopsy at the time of disease progression, as well 
as corresponding blood samples for ctDNA analysis. For subjects in Cohorts C, MET-1, MET-2, 
and E, equivalent pre-treatment tumour tissue must have been collected after progression on 
the most recent systemic anti-cancer treatment. 
Key exclusion criteria: 
•  Subjects with untreated brain metastases. Patients with definitively, locally-treated metastases 
that are clinically stable and asymptomatic for at least 2 weeks and who are off or receiving 
low-dose corticosteroid treatment (≤10 mg prednisone or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior 
to study treatment are eligible. 
•  Medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including drug-induced ILD or radiation 
pneumonitis requiring treatment with prolonged steroids or other immune suppressive agents 
within the last 2 years. 
•  Treatments 
Amivantamab was administered via intravenous (IV) infusion (minimum infusion time ≥ 60 minutes) 
once weekly for the first 4 weeks (i.e., Cycle 1) and once every 2 weeks (Days 1 and 15 of each cycle) 
thereafter during subsequent 28-day cycles. To minimize the risk of infusion-related reactions (IRRs), 
the first dose was split over 2 days (Cycle 1, Days 1 and 2), required steroid premedication, and was 
administered using an accelerated infusion strategy. The RP2D was determined to be 1050 mg for 
subjects weighing <80 kg, and 1400 mg for subjects weighing ≥80 kg and this dosage is the basis of 
the primary efficacy population. Treatment beyond disease progression was allowed for individual 
patients following approval from the medical monitor. This was also done in a number of patients, as 
evident in Figure 11.

tumour tissue 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Endpoints according to Statistical Analysis Plan for Exon20 IA, version 7: 
Primary endpoint  
•  Overall response rate (ORR) as per RECIST v.1.1 as evaluated by the investigator. ORR is 
defined as the proportion of subjects achieved either a confirmed CR or PR based on RECIST v. 
1.1. among efficacy evaluable analysis set.  
•  ORR assessed by IRC will also be analysed. 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Duration of response (DOR) [by investigator assessment] will be analysed for subjects who 
achieve the confirmed CR or PR. DOR is defined as time from first documentation of a response 
of PR or CR to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease or death due to 
any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who are progression free and alive or have 
unknown status will be censored at last tumour assessment. Subjects who started a 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 71/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy in the absence of progression will be censored at the last 
disease assessment before the start of subsequent therapy. DOR assessed by IRC will also be 
analysed.  
• 
Progression free survival (PFS) [by investigator assessment], defined as the interval between 
the date of the first dose and the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, 
whichever occur first. Subjects who are progression-free and alive or have unknown status will 
be censored at last tumour assessment. Subjects with no post baseline disease assessment will 
be censored on Day 1. Subjects who started a subsequent anti-cancer therapy in the absence 
of progression will be censored at the last disease assessment before the start of subsequent 
therapy. Subjects whose diseases have not progressed and who are still alive at the end of the 
study or clinical cut-off will be censored at the last adequate disease assessment. PFS assessed 
by IRC will also be analysed.  
•  Overall survival (OS), defined as the interval between the date of the first dose and the date of 
the subject’s death from any cause. If the subject is alive or the vital status is unknown, then 
the subject’s data will be censored at the date the subject was last known to be alive. The date 
of last known alive will be determined by the maximum collection/assessment date from 
among data domains within the clinical database. 
•  Clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of subjects achieving complete or partial 
response, as well as durable stable disease (defined as a duration of at least 11 weeks) as 
defined by RECIST v1.1. 
• 
Time to Treatment Failure (TTF), defined as the time from the first infusion of the study drug 
to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including disease progression, treatment 
toxicity, death, and will be utilized to capture clinical benefit for patients continuing treatment 
beyond RECIST v1.1 defined disease progression. Subjects who are treatment failure free or 
have unknown status will be censored at last tumour assessment. Subjects with no post 
baseline disease assessment will be censored on Day 1. 
•  Sample size 
For Part 1 dose escalation cohorts, 3 to 6 subjects will be treated at each dose level based on the 3 + 
3 dose escalation scheme. 
For Part 2, the maximum total sample size at a RP2D was set to be approximately 460 subjects. This 
includes approximately 40 subjects in Cohort A, 20 subjects in Cohort B, and up to 100 subjects each if 
sufficient efficacy is observed in Cohorts C, D, MET-1, and MET-2 at a RP2D of JNJ-61186372 
monotherapy. 
For Cohorts C, D, MET-1, and MET-2 in Part 2, within each cohort, a 2-stage design will be employed. 
The interim analysis will be performed when approximately 30 subjects were enrolled in each cohort 
and has sufficient data (i.e., post-baseline disease assessment) to be evaluable for response. Future 
enrolment into each cohort may have been terminated if it is determined during the first stage that the 
treatment is considered as ineffective as compared to other treatment options and/or not well 
tolerated. The null hypothesis is that the ORR ≤15%, and the alternative hypothesis is that the ORR 
≥30%. With a one-sided alpha of 2.5%, and a power of 87.5%, the total number of subjects needed 
for each cohort is 86 response-evaluable subjects. Assuming a non-evaluable rate of 15%, 
approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled within each cohort, although the number of subjects may 
be expanded beyond 100 subjects (maximum of approximately 150) to further characterize activity for 
subpopulations within a cohort. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 72/144 
 
 
 
 
 
The sample size consideration for the subgroup of Exon 20 insertion mutant NSCLC patients who 
required to have had previous therapy with a combination platinum-doublet chemotherapy regimen is 
based on the null hypothesis of ORR ≤12%, and the alternative hypothesis of ORR >25%. To have a 
power of 80% to reject the null hypothesis with a 1-sided alpha of 0.025, at least 60 subjects will be 
required to enrol in the subgroup; approximately 100 subjects were targeted for enrolment to 
characterize the activity of JNJ 61186372 in this population. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
This is an open-label, single-arm study. No randomization or blinding of treatment were performed. 
•  Statistical methods 
Analysis population  
Data reported are summarized separately for the dose escalation phase (Part 1) and for the combined 
dose escalation and dose expansion phases (Part 1 and Part 2), with a focus on subjects comprising 
the Exon 20ins + prior chemotherapy at RP2D population. 
The efficacy analysis population includes subjects treated with amivantamab monotherapy in the dose 
expansion phase (Part 2; derived primarily from subjects enrolled in Cohort D and to a lesser extent, 
Cohort A) as well as those treated in the dose escalation phase (Part 1).  
Planned Analyses 
Data reflect those available as of the clinical cut-off of 08 June 2020 (31 March 2020 for 
pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamic data) from subjects treated with amivantamab 
monotherapy. 
All efficacy analyses were performed using the efficacy analysis set (also referred to as efficacy 
evaluable analysis set on tables and listings), which included all subjects who received the first dose of 
amivantamab as monotherapy on or before 05 February 2020 and were to have undergone at least 3 
scheduled post-baseline disease assessments or discontinued treatment for any reason, including 
disease progression/death, prior to the clinical cut-off. 
Efficacy analyses were performed based on the efficacy analysis set for the following populations: 
• 
• 
• 
Exon 20ins + prior chemotherapy at RP2D population: subjects with locally-documented Exon 
20ins NSCLC enrolled in Part 1 or Part 2 who were treated with amivantamab monotherapy at 
a dose consistent with the RP2D (1050 mg for body weight <80 kg and 1400 mg for body 
weight >80 kg), had received prior platinum chemotherapy and had metastases within 12 
months from last platinum-based chemotherapy use. 
Exon 20ins + no prior chemotherapy at RP2D population: subjects with locally-documented 
Exon 20ins NSCLC enrolled in Part 1 or Part 2 who were treated with amivantamab 
monotherapy at a dose consistent with the RP2D who had not received platinum-based 
chemotherapy within 12 months of diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC. 
Exon 20ins at Non-RP2D population: subjects with locally-documented Exon 20ins NSCLC 
(irrespective of prior chemotherapy) enrolled in Part 1 or Part 2 and treated at amivantamab 
monotherapy doses other than the RP2D. 
The primary efficacy analysis is based on the Exon 20 + prior chemotherapy at RP2D efficacy 
population. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 73/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The protocol-specified primary efficacy endpoint was the ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects 
with a best overall response of a confirmed CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1 criteria (best response as 
recorded in the CRF from the start of the study drug until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, 
or start of a subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever came first).  
The observed overall response rate and its 95% 2-sided exact confidence interval were presented 
based on efficacy evaluable analysis set: Exon 20ins subjects at RP2D with prior chemotherapy, Exon 
20ins subjects at RP2D without prior chemotherapy, Exon 20ins subjects at RP2D, Exon 20ins subjects 
at non-RP2D, and all subjects in part 1. The summary for all subjects in part 1 will be presented for 
each dose level and total. 
ORR assessed by IRC will also be analyzed similarly for Exon 20ins subjects at RP2D with prior 
chemotherapy, Exon 20ins subjects at RP2D without prior chemotherapy, Exon 20ins subjects at RP2D. 
The null hypothesis would be rejected if the lower bound of 95% two-sided CI of the ORR was above 
12% for the Exon 20ins subjects + prior chemotherapy at RP2D efficacy population. 
The following secondary efficacy analyses were performed to explore the clinical activity of 
amivantamab: 
•  Clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of subjects achieving a best overall 
response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or durable SD (duration of at least 11 weeks) as 
defined by RECIST v1.1. The CBR and its 95% 2-sided exact CI, based on investigator and 
BICR assessments, were calculated. 
•  Duration of response (DOR) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median DOR 
and corresponding 95% CI were provided, as was a swim lane plot for responders. The DOR 
was defined as time from first documentation of a PR or CR to the date of first documented 
evidence of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, for 
subjects who achieved a confirmed best overall response of CR or PR based on investigator and 
BICR assessment. Subjects who were progression-free and alive, or who had an unknown 
status, were censored at the last tumour assessment; subjects who started subsequent anti-
cancer therapy in the absence of progression were censored at the last disease assessment 
before the start of subsequent therapy. 
• 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median PFS 
and corresponding 95% CI based on investigator and BICR assessments, as well as the PFS 
rates at specified timepoints, were provided. The PFS was defined as the time interval from the 
first dosing date to the first date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurred first. Subjects who were progression-free and alive, or who had an unknown status, 
were censored at the last tumour assessment; subjects who started subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy in the absence of progression were censored at the last disease assessment before the 
start of subsequent therapy. Subjects with no post-baseline disease assessment were censored 
on Day 1.  
•  Overall survival (OS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median OS and 
corresponding 95% CI, as well as the OS rate at specified timepoints, were provided. The OS 
was defined as the time interval from the first dosing date to the date of the subject’s death 
from any cause. Subjects who were alive or whose vital status was unknown were censored at 
the date the subject was last known to be alive. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 74/144 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Time to treatment failure (TTF) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median TTF 
and corresponding 95% CI were provided. The TTF was defined as the time interval from the 
first dosing date to study drug discontinuation for any reason. Subjects who were treatment 
failure-free or had an unknown status were censored at last tumour assessment. Subjects with 
no post-baseline disease assessment were censored on Day 1. 
The best percentage change from baseline in the sum of diameters (SoD) of target lesions was 
determined for each subject with measurable disease at baseline based on investigator and 
BICR assessments and summarized using a waterfall plot. 
Subgroup Analyses 
The ORR (and exact 95% CI) as per investigator assessments was analysed for the following 
subgroups of the Exon 20ins at RP2D efficacy populations (ie, Exon 20ins + prior chemotherapy at 
RP2D; Exon 20ins + no prior chemotherapy at RP2D): 
•  Age: subgroups of <65 versus ≥65 years and <75 versus ≥75 years 
•  Sex: male versus female 
•  Race: Asian versus non-Asian (subjects with unknown race were not included in the subgroup 
analysis) 
•  Baseline ECOG performance status: 0 versus ≥1 
•  History of smoking: yes versus no 
• 
Prior immunotherapy: yes versus no 
•  Key Exon 20ins variants (based on ctDNA analysis of pretreatment samples). The change in 
SoD for target lesions was also described for these subgroups using a waterfall plot. 
Interim Monitoring for Futility 
A planned interim monitoring for futility will be carried out separately for Cohorts C, D, MET-1, and 
MET-2 when there are at least 30 response evaluable subjects in the respective cohort. With 30 
subjects evaluable for response within each cohort, if 5 or fewer responses are observed, the null 
hypothesis (ORR ≤15%) will be accepted and enrolment for the cohort may be terminated for futility 
by the SET. Otherwise, additional subjects will be enrolled for total 100 subjects in the cohort for the 
final analysis. This stopping criterion leads to probability of early termination (at least 71.1%) at the 
interim analysis under the null hypothesis that the ORR is at most 15%. 
For Cohorts C, MET-1, and MET-2, the ORR of pre-defined molecular subgroups (EGFR-mediated [eg, 
C797S mutation], cMet-mediated [eg, degree of cMet amplification, cMet Exon 14 skipping], or other 
TKI resistance [eg, B-raf]) will be calculated in addition to the ORR for the cohort. Based on the data of 
these molecular subgroups at the interim monitoring, if the SET determines that any of these 
molecular subgroups has clinically meaningful ORR (as defined in Section 8.2), that particular 
molecular subgroup may be expanded to have a total of 100 subjects. 
A planned interim monitoring for futility will also be carried out for Cohort E when there are 40 
response evaluable subjects in the cohort. With 40 response evaluable subjects, if 11 or fewer 
responses are observed, the null hypothesis (ORR ≤25%) will be accepted and enrolment for the 
cohort may be terminated for futility by the SET. Otherwise, additional subjects will be enrolled for a 
total of 100 subjects in the cohort for the final analysis. This stopping criterion leads to probability of 
early termination (at least 71.5%) at the interim analysis under the null hypothesis of the ORR ≤25%.

•  Recruitment 
The first subject in Study EDI1001 consented on 27 May 2016 (Part 1). Cohorts A, B, C, D, MET-1, and 
E are closed for enrolment. Of these, cohorts C, D, MET-1 and E have patients with treatment still 
ongoing. The only cohort currently open to enrolment is MET-2 (Figure 8). In addition, 2 cohorts are 
planned in wild-type EGFR NSCLC. The end of study is planned to occur after the last subject on study 
treatment completes therapy and has at least 6 months of follow-up. 
•  Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations were reported in 19/114 (16.7%) subjects in the Exon 20ins + prior 
chemotherapy at RP2D primary efficacy population. None of these deviations led to exclusion of data 
from the safety or efficacy analyses. 
•  6/114 (5.3%) subjects developed withdrawal criteria, but were not withdrawn from study 
treatment. All 6 subjects had RECIST disease progression and continued on study treatment, 
prior to obtaining Sponsor approval for treatment beyond progression, as instructed by the 
protocol.  
•  5/114 (4.4%) subjects did not satisfy the protocol-specified eligibility criteria, but were 
enrolled. Two of these subjects had Screening laboratory criteria out of range and 3 subjects 
had exclusionary concurrent conditions; 1 subject with untreated brain metastases, 1 subject 
with an active infection (Gr. 2 mucositis), and 1 subject with uncontrolled pain.  
•  1/114 (0.9%) subject received prohibited concomitant treatment of radiotherapy. This subject 
had RECIST PD reported 24 Oct 2019 and was continuing treatment with amivantamab beyond 
progression when they received palliative radiotherapy to a non-target lesion from 12 Dec 
2019 through 18 Dec 2019, prior to obtaining Sponsor approval, as instructed by the protocol. 
•  4/114 (3.53%) subjects received incorrect treatment or incorrect dose. Of these, 3 subjects 
had deviations concerning a single dose administration inconsistent with protocol guidelines. 
The remaining deviation related to study treatment involved 1 subject who received 
amivantamab using a central line during Cycle 1, instead of a peripheral line, as instructed by 
the protocol.  
•  Major protocol deviations categorized as ‘Other’ occurred in 6/114 (5.3%) subjects. This 
category included deviations for 5 subjects concerning failure to adjust study drug 
administration following the occurrence of an IRR.  Of these 5 subjects, 4 deviations were due 
to the infusion flow rate not being reduced following an IRR and 1 deviation was due to an 
infusion not being interrupted at the time of the IRR. All 5 subjects recovered from the IRR and 
remained on study treatment.  
o  The  remaining  major  deviation  categorized  as  ‘Other’  was  failure  to  obtain  pregnancy 
test  within  24  hours  of  the  first  infusion  in  a  woman  of  child-bearing  potential  (this 
subject had a negative pregnancy test at Screening and during Treatment Period).

Protocol amendments 
Table 18. Protocol amendments, Clinical Protocol 61186372EDI1001 (Study EDI1001) 
The overall reasons for the amendments: 
Amendment 9 (30 April 2020): This amendment is being instituted to determine the recommended 
Phase 2 dosing of JNJ-61186372 when administered on a 21-day cycle (RP2Dq3W) in combination with 
standard of care carboplatin and pemetrexed. 
Amendment 8 (27 January 2020):The overall reasons for the amendment are to 1) allow expansion 
of cohorts beyond 100 subjects to further characterize study treatment activity within cohort 
subpopulations, and to ensure adequate representation of subjects with the minimum number of prior 
therapies for each cohort, and adjust the statistical plan (sample size and efficacy analysis) 
accordingly, 2) allow for additional Part 1 cohorts to explore new dosing schedules, routes of 
administration, or batches of JNJ-61186372 drug product, and provide new alternate dosing schedules, 
3) further define cohorts as to the number of prior therapies allowed, and 4) modify inclusion criteria 
to allow enrolment of treatment naïve subjects into Part 1 combination dose escalation. Additional 
minor clarifications and modifications to study conduct are also made

Amendment 7 (19 August 2019): This amendment is intended to expand the combination cohort in 
all countries to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of JNJ-61186372 in combination with 
lazertinib and to evaluate anti-tumour activity of the combination in subjects who have progressed on 
osimertinib (third generation TKI) 
Amendment 6 (29 May2019): Initiation of two new MET-specific cohorts: Cohort MET-1 and Cohort 
MET-2, and removing MET as a qualifying mutation for Cohort C. The overall reasons for the 
amendment are to include the additional cohorts in Part 2 of the study, increase the study population 
size for Part 2, and include an optional Pre-Screening period. 
Amendment 5 (6 September 2018): The overall reason for the amendment is to enact the SET 
decision to limit eligible subjects for Cohort C to those with a demonstrable EGFR or cMET mutation 
conferring resistance to treatment with previous TKI. 
Amendment 4 (9 March 2018): The SET has declared 1400 mg dose safe, and further escalation was 
recommended. These results have been added to the protocol and provide the rationale to continue 
dose escalation. The overall study population initially enrolled in Part 2 is increased from 60 up to 
approximately 120 subjects (40 in Cohort A and 20 in Cohort B), and two cohorts (Cohort C and Cohort 
D, 30 subjects each with potential to increase to 100 subjects each) based on previously diagnosed 
EGFR mutation and prior anti-cancer therapy are added to more clearly evaluate clinical endpoints. 
Due to changing standard of care, and overlapping target populations, Cohort A and B will be closed to 
further recruitment upon opening of Cohort C and D. 
Amendment 3 (31 May 2017): In Part 2 of this study, subjects will be enrolled in one of two cohorts 
according to molecular markers of interest. Tumour tissue samples will be required at study entry 
(screening) and after progression to evaluate biomarkers that may be predictive of drug-clinical 
response relationship and mechanisms of resistance; circulating DNA will be required for cohort 
assignment. The Part 2 study population size has been increased from 20 up to approximately 60 
subjects in order to sufficiently evaluate the study objectives and endpoints. Additionally, as clinical 
benefit has been observed in this study, the objectives now focus on objective response rate and 
clinical benefit. Primary objective was expanded to include anti-tumour activity, in addition to 
previously safety and tolerability. ORR by investigator and CBR were added as primary endpoints.  
Amendment 2 (12- Dec-2016): Addition of guidance for bone scintigraphy and screening brain MRI, 
clarify the protocol requirement for CT of the neck, specify which ECG parameters will be collected and 
analysed, update guidance on pre-and post-infusion medications, provide guidance on follow-up of 
bone metastases, clarify timeframe for pre-dose vital sign collection, specify that laboratory data 
should be available and reviewed by the investigator prior to each dose, and to correct a typographical 
error in Inclusion Criterion 7. 
Amendment 1 (14 April 2016): Remove the time interval limitation for triplicate ECG collection, 
change body temperature location from oral to tympanic, clarify that vital sign measurements during 
study drug infusion should include a pre-infusion timepoint, update the blood volume required, and 
make wording corrections.

Identification of EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutation 
Tumour tissue (93%) and/or plasma (10%) samples for all patients were tested locally to determine 
EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutation status using next generation sequencing (NGS) in 46% of patients 
and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 41% of patients; for 4% of patients, the testing methods 
were not specified.  
As part of the study, both blood and tumour samples were requested from each subject for the clinical 
validation of 2 companion diagnostic (CDx) tests (ThermoFisher Oncomine Dx Target Test with tissue 
and Guardant360 CDx with ctDNA). The concordance estimate and 2-sided 95% Wilson CI of the valid 
Oncomine Dx Target Test (tissue CDx) results to the local testing results within the primary efficacy 
population is 94.1% (84.1% - 98.0%). The concordance estimate and 2-sided 95% Wilson CI of the 
valid Guardant360 CDx (ctDNA CDx) test results to the local testing results within the primary efficacy 
population is 79.1% (70.6% - 85.6%). 
•  Numbers analysed 
The application primarily concerns the results in subjects with the Exon 20ins mutation who had had 
progressed on or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy and who were treated at the RP2D for 
amivantamab monotherapy. This includes subjects treated with amivantamab monotherapy in the dose 
expansion phase (Part 2; derived primarily from subjects enrolled in Cohort D and to a lesser extent, 
Cohort A) as well as those treated in the dose escalation phase (Part 1). 
Efficacy analysis set  
All efficacy analyses were performed using the efficacy analysis set (also referred to as efficacy 
evaluable analysis set), which included all subjects who received the first dose of amivantamab as 
monotherapy on or before 05 February 2020 (an additional cut-off was subsequently used for the 
pivotal analysis set, 04 June 2020), were to have undergone at least 3 scheduled post-baseline disease 
assessments or discontinued treatment for any reason, including disease progression/death, prior to 
the clinical cut-off. 
Efficacy analyses were performed based on the efficacy analysis set for the following populations: 
•  Exon 20ins + prior chemotherapy at RP2D population: subjects with locally-documented 
Exon 20ins NSCLC enrolled in Part 1 or Part 2 who were treated with amivantamab 
monotherapy at a dose consistent with the RP2D (1050 mg for body weight <80 kg and 1400 
mg for body weight >80 kg), had received prior platinum chemotherapy and had metastases 
within 12 months from last platinum-based chemotherapy use. 
•  Exon 20ins + no prior chemotherapy at RP2D population: subjects with locally- 
documented Exon 20ins NSCLC enrolled in Part 1 or Part 2 who were treated with 
amivantamab monotherapy at a dose consistent with the RP2D who had not received platinum-
based chemotherapy within 12 months of diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 83/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Exon 20ins at Non-RP2D population: subjects with locally-documented Exon 20ins NSCLC 
(irrespective of prior chemotherapy) enrolled in Part 1 or Part 2 and treated at amivantamab 
monotherapy doses other than the RP2D. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
The focus of the efficacy assessment will be on the results from the most recent data cut-off, 30 March 
2021, and the most extensive data set fulfilling the criteria for the primary efficacy population, 
provided during the marketing authorisation application procedure. An update was not provided for the 
supportive efficacy populations (i.e., 24 subjects with Exon 20ins NSCLC treated at RP2D who had not 
received prior platinum-based chemotherapy and 42 subjects with Exon 20ins NSCLC treated at Non-
RP2D doses). Therefore, data from different cut-offs will be presented. 
Summary of key efficacy outcomes  
Three data cut-offs have been presented for the initial primary 81 efficacy population: 08 June 2020, 
08 October 2020, and in responses to questions, 30 March 2021, the latter reflecting an additional 9 
months of follow-up from the 08 October 2020 cut-off (Table 29), in total a median follow-up of 14.5 
months. 
Results were presented for an extended primary efficacy population of 114 subjects, with a first dose 
on or before 04 June 2020 (Table 30). At the latest data cut-off, representing a median follow-up of 
12.5 months, this population fulfilled the follow-up criterion for the primary efficacy population.

Reliability of ORR estimates 
The reliability and potential bias of the ORR estimates was a major concern, given the exploratory 
nature of the pivotal study and was therefore explored in different ways. The ORR estimates have been 
consistent in all analyses for different data cut-offs and analysis sets of Exon 20ins patients at RP2D 
provided in the regulatory process to date, providing reassurance in the ORR estimate:

Time to response 
The swimmer plot shows generally early partial responses, the majority occurring before 2 months of 
treatment (Figure 11). This was confirmed in a requested analysis of time to response. In the 114 
subjects in the primary efficacy population, at final cut-off date of 30 March 2021, there were 42 
investigator-assessed responders, with a median time to response of 1.6 months (range:1.3 to 9.7 
months), which corresponds with the first scheduled post-baseline disease assessment at 6 weeks.  
Post-progression continuation of therapy 
Among the 114 patients, data from 25 patients who received continued treatment with amivantamab 
post progression and who had a post-progression disease assessment, showed a duration of post-
progression amivantamab treatment of mean 4.5 months, and median 4.2 months. 16% received 
post-progression therapy for ≥ 6 months.

PFS sensitivity analysis 
Subjects who started a subsequent anti-cancer therapy in the absence of progression were censored at 
the last disease assessment before the start of subsequent therapy. In the primary efficacy population 
(n=114) only 2 patients were censored for this reason. A requested sensitivity analysis showed a

similar median PFS (6.87 months, 95% CI: 5.49, 8.28 months) as in the primary analysis (6.93 
months, 95% CI: 5.55, 8.64 months), when the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy was 
treated as a progression event.

These subgroups were “pre-planned”, to the extent it is meaningful to discuss pre-planning in relation 
to this exploratory study with many and major protocol changes.  
It is noted that activity of amivantamab is present irrespective of prior immunotherapy.  
The largest difference is seen for ECOG performance status, with ORR 48% for ECOG 0 and 32% for 
ECOG 1. The median number of lines of prior therapy was 2, (range 1-7). There was no discernible 
biologically plausible pattern with regard to number of lines, however (Figure 13).

Brain metastases 
Patients with untreated brain metastases were excluded from study participation. Regular follow-up 
imaging for new CNS disease was not required by the protocol and intracranial responses were not 
assessed. Subjects with a prior history of brain/CNS metastases had similar overall response rate 
(43% vs 39%) and duration of response (16.1 vs. 11.2 months) as those without (Table 35).

Study NSC1002 – Real-world data (RWD) 
As patients with EGFR Exon 20ins NSCLC have been excluded from the majority of Phase 3 studies of 
EGFR TKIs, this population has been relatively understudied in clinical studies, and published reports 
have often been based on retrospective analyses or case series/reports. To better understand the 
prognosis of these patients with EGFR Exon 20ins, as compared with patients with common EGFR 
(cEGFR) mutations, and to confirm treatment utilization and outcomes with available therapies, a 
retrospective cohort study of RWD, Study 61186372NSC1002 (hereafter referred to as Study 
NSC1002), was conducted and utilized claims reimbursement data and electronic health records 
(EHRs) on second-line treatment patterns for advanced NSCLC, including EGFR Exon 20ins NSCLC. 
Methods 
Study Design and Setting  
This retrospective cohort study included patients aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of advanced NSCLC 
between 01 January 2011 and 31 May 2020 in the Advanced NSCLC Flatiron Registry EHR-derived 
deidentified database (a nationwide longitudinal, demographically and geographically diverse database 
with data from more than 280 cancer clinics including more than 2.4 million US cancer patients). 
Eligible patients were required to have (1) at least 2 documented clinical visits on or after 01 January 
2011, (2) structured activity (e.g., office visit, medication fill), (3) started first-line therapy within 90 
days of diagnosis, and (4) a positive test result for Exon 20ins or cEGFR mutation on or before the 
start date of treatment Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, or first TKI line (+28 days) to ensure that treatment was 
based on the known mutation status. 
Data Conventions and Analytic Approach 
Derivation of rwOS relies on death information. Due to privacy regulations, only month and year of 
death are recorded in the data. As a convention, the date of the death is derived as 15th day of the 
month or last confirmed activity date +1, whichever is later.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 98/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Real-world OS and rwPFS endpoints were summarized using Kaplan–Meier survival function estimation 
for each cohort, including median and quartiles of survival with 95% CIs for each cohort. For assessing 
the prognosis for Exon 20ins compared with cEGFR mutations, adjusted hazard ratio (HR), its 95% CI, 
and p-value were calculated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, including the 
covariates of age, time from diagnosis of advanced disease to treatment, time from initial diagnosis to 
advanced diagnosis, line of therapy, ECOG performance score, smoking history, sex, and practice type. 
For the Exon 20ins comparison with cEGFR mutations in patients treated with TKIs, the TKI line of 
therapy was used as strata, in addition to the covariates used in the Cox model for the prognosis 
assessment. 
Results 
Among 62,464 patients with advanced NSCLC in the database, EGFR mutations were detected in 4485 
patients. These mutations were mostly detected by next-generation sequencing or polymerase chain 
reaction (69.6%). Of these, 3281 met the inclusion criterion of structured activity within 90 days and 
starting first-line therapy within 90 days of diagnosis. A total of 3014 patients met all study criteria and 
had an EGFR mutation detected on or before the start of treatment Line 1 +28 days and so were 
eligible for the analysis of prognostic value of Exon 20ins versus cEGFR mutations. For Line 2 and Line 
3 of therapy, 1744 and 949 patients, respectively, had an EGFR mutation detected on or before the 
start of that treatment line +28 days. For predictive value of Exon 20ins versus cEGFR mutations for 
TKI treatment, 2825 patients had an EGFR mutation detected on or before the start of first TKI line of 
therapy +28 days, and so were eligible for the analysis. Nine patients who had both Exon 20ins as well 
as cEGFR mutations detected and identified were excluded from all analyses so as not to bias results 
for either cohort. 
Baseline characteristics for the 3014 patients were generally similar between the Exon 20ins and 
cEGFR mutation cohorts, except for the proportion of men (39% vs 33%, respectively) and history of 
smoking (54% vs 45%, respectively) (See table below). Subsets of these patients were used for the 
predictive value of Exon 20ins for TKI treatment and treatment patterns analyses.

Prognostic Value of Exon 20ins Mutations Versus cEGFR Mutations 
The analysis compared outcomes in the first-line setting (Line 1) and included 3014 patients (181 Exon 
20ins and 2833 cEGFR mutations). Patients with Exon 20ins had a shorter median survival (16.23 
months, 95% CI: 11.04, 19.38) than those with cEGFR mutations (25.49 months, 95% CI: 24.48, 
27.04), and a 75% increased risk of death compared with those with cEGFR mutations (adjusted 
hazard ratio [AdjHR]: 1.75 [95% CI: 1.45, 2.13); p<0.0001 (Figure 16).

Predictive value of Exon 20ins on EGFR TKI outcomes (Exon 20ins versus cEGFR patients) 
This analysis, stratified by the line of TKI treatment, included data from the first use of a TKI in 2825 
TKI-treated patients (76 with Exon 20ins and 2749 with cEGFR mutations). Overall, 80.8% initiated 
TKI as first-line therapy, 15.9% as second-line, and 3.3% at third-line or later.  
After a median follow-up of 20.6 months, 59 (79.6%) progression events or deaths were observed in 
the Exon 20ins cohort and 1793 (65.2%) in the cEGFR mutation cohort. Exon 20ins patients treated 
with EGFR TKI showed worse outcomes, with a median PFS estimate of 2.86 months (95%CI: 2.14, 
3.91) compared with 10.45 (95%CI: 10.05, 10.94) months in cEGFR patients. The Exon 20ins cohort 
had 169% increased risk of progression or death (AdjHR: 2.7 [95%CI: 2.05, 3.54]; p<0.0001) (Figure 
17).

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application rests on preliminary efficacy data, pooled from different parts and cohorts of a single, 
exploratory, first-in-human (FIH), single-arm trial (SAT), lacking meaningful pre-specification of 
efficacy hypotheses.  
The exploratory character of the pivotal study is noticeable in aspects related to study conduct, for 
example inconsistencies between the study protocol and the SAP for the present analysis, including 
major aspects such as the primary endpoint. In line with the exploratory setting, data-driven changes 
to the protocol have been made repeatedly. Primary and secondary endpoints were changed in 
protocol amendments during the course of the study. Several efficacy endpoints (ORR, DOR, CBR) 
were noted as primary endpoints in the last (global) protocol amendment (Amendment 9, 30 April 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 103/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2020). However, in the last version of the SAP for Exon 20ins IA, (version 7, 9 July 2020), ORR by 
investigator was listed as the primary endpoint, while it is mentioned that ORR by BICR “will also be 
analysed”. Similarly, for DOR and PFS it is mentioned that BICR assessments “will also be analysed”, 
suggesting that the investigator assessment is the primary analysis. Taken together, the BICR analysis 
is interpreted to be a sensitivity analysis to the designated primary analysis based on investigator 
assessments for ORR, DOR and PFS. 
These are issues that if observed in a standard confirmatory phase 3 study would raise concerns with 
regard to study and data integrity and might thus trigger a GCP inspection. In the present setting, 
however, they are considered to merely reflect the early exploratory phase of drug development. 
ORR, according to standardised criteria, is the only acceptable primary efficacy endpoint from this 
single-arm trial, because objective tumour response is the only of the presented disease outcome 
measures that directly reflects a drug-effect. This is because malignant tumours only anecdotally 
shrink spontaneously to the extent required for a partial response. All other efficacy measures tend to 
reflect to a high degree also the tumour biology, the inherent prognosis of the disease and the 
patients’ performance status and comorbidities. Thus, these are not interpretable with regard to drug-
effect in a single-arm study. Measures such as time-to-event outcomes, including PFS and OS, and 
clinical benefit rate, which includes not only complete and partial response (CR and PR) but also stable 
disease (SD), are therefore only relevant for contextualisation and not as claims. Duration of response 
(DOR) is also affected by prognosis but is considered of relevance as a description of the responses 
and for evaluation of their clinical value. 
Statistical issues 
Due to the non-randomised/single-arm open-label design, the risk of selection bias cannot be 
eliminated. Without a concurrent control, the impact of e.g. subject selection on the claimed effect size 
is difficult to assess. In this context, it is notable that the primary efficacy population was selected 
from a study in which the efficacy of amivantamab was tested in several biomarker defined 
populations, among which the present one was selected. 
The statistical analysis plan for the interim analysis for Exon 20 insertion mutation patients which this 
application is based on was dated 9 July 2020. This date is after the date of cut-off for the analysis 
database. The lack of pre-specification, together with the open-label nature of the study, provides 
results that can only be interpreted as exploratory and the risk of selection bias is apparent.  
In a previous national advice meeting it was suggested to address the likely bias in the estimates due 
to data-driven selection of cohorts for expansion, by using the latter 40 patients as a separate 
validation set to confirm the results in the first approximately 40 (39) patients. Normally, the results in 
the validation set would be used as the primary estimates for approval. An alternative way to assess 
the evolving ORR estimate over time to is to plot ORR over time based on “step-wise” estimates 
starting with the first 5 patients and incrementing the population by 5 patients for each estimate. In 
the same way, a presentation of moving average ORR based on 20 patients with increments of 1 
patient was requested, i.e. beginning from the ORR among the first 20 patients initiating treatment (in 
the efficacy population), followed by the ORR for the set of patients from the 2nd to 21st etc. through 
to the ORR for the last 20 patients that contribute to the efficacy assessment. These analyses showed 
a slight decline in estimated ORR assessed by investigators towards the end of the study. The same 
analysis based on ORR by BICR showed a stable ORR estimate over time. 
In response to a request for further information to evaluate the impact of shorter follow-up time and 
changes in patient characteristics on ORR estimate, the Applicant conducted a logistic regression 
analysis regressing the probability of response to a range of potentially relevant patient characteristics 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 104/144 
 
 
 
 
 
and follow-up time. Following stepwise model selection, time from the latest platinum chemotherapy 
date, bone metastasis, and the duration of follow-up were found to be predictive of response.  
Based on these predictive parameters, the predicted ORR for the 43 subjects enrolled after 05 
February 2020 was 29.3% that was predicted to raise to 41.4% with an average of 5 month’s 
additional follow-up. 
In absence of detailed analysis specifications, it appears that the Applicant’s method of adjustment for 
follow-up duration may not be appropriate since it is based on the correlation of response and follow-
up duration among those who were enrolled before 05 February 2020. This correlation cannot be 
interpreted as causal effect of follow-up duration on the probability of response. On the contrary, long 
follow-up is a consequence of a good response. Based on the correlation, no predictions can be made 
about how many additional responses are likely to be observed if these particular patients would be 
followed up further. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose-finding 
The dose-finding Part 1 of Study EDI1001 was performed in a molecularly non-selected patient 
population with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. However, the majority of subjects (86%) were 
previously diagnosed with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. This could explain why objective responses were 
observed at similar frequency around 20% in the 4 dose cohorts (700-1750 mg) where objective 
responses were observed. However, anti-tumour activity (tumour decrease of -20% from baseline) was 
observed also in a couple of patients with wild-type EGFR cancers in 350 mg (squamous cell 
carcinoma) and 1050 mg cohorts (adenocarcinoma), respectively. One may speculate that this could 
indicate that amivantamab activity is not specific to EGFR or MET mutated tumours but might exert a 
certain degree of effect regardless of mutational status on the basis of these pathways being important 
to all tumours.  
No MTD was identified at doses up to 1750 mg. A flat dose of 1050 mg was initially selected as the 
RP2D. However, because patients who weighed ≥ 80 kg had a lower exposure than patients weighing 
< 80 kg, the dosing was increased in patients ≥ 80 kg in order to achieve similar exposure across 
groups. A concern was raised, however, based on the efficacy data in Part 2 from patients receiving 
RP2D and non-RP2D doses, that heavier patients in the < 80 kg group might be underdosed. However, 
based on analyses of patients on RP2D, ORR results showed no trend towards decreased ORRs as a 
function of increasing weight, within subjects weighing <80kg at RP2D dose. The selection of RP2D 
appears reasonably well-founded based on the available data at the time and is supported by the 
subsequent efficacy data.  
Efficacy 
The initially presented primary efficacy population consisted of 81 patients pooled from Part 1 and from 
the Part 2 cohorts A, “EGFR-dependent resistance”, and D, “EGFR Exon 20ins”. Key criteria for 
inclusion were Exon 20 insertion and prior chemotherapy, measurable disease at baseline, and 
treatment with amivantamab monotherapy at RP2D. With regard to follow-up, a first dose on or before 
05 February 2020 was required. During the evaluation, the applicant presented a new data cut-off of 
30 March 2021, by which also the full 114 population defined as population of interest fulfilled the 
follow-up criteria for the primary efficacy population, based on a required first dose on or before 04 
June 2020. This is referred to as the extended primary efficacy population or the 114 population. In 
the absence of a pre-planned hypothesis testing analysis population, this extended primary efficacy 
population is considered the most informative, and thus the pivotal data set for the approval.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 105/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Key efficacy results in the pivotal 114-population included the primary endpoint ORR by investigator 
assessments (INV) at 36.8% (95% CI: 28.0%, 46.4%). The ORR sensitivity analysis by BICR showed 
ORR 43.0% (95% CI: 33.7%, 52.6%).  
The median DOR was 12.5 months (95% CI: 6.5, 16.1) by INV, and 10.8 months (95% CI: 6.9, 15.0) 
by BICR. Subjects with DoR ≥ 6 months: 64.3% (INV), 55.1% (BICR). 
Median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.6, 8.6) by INV, and 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.5, 9.7) by BICR. 
Median OS was 22.8 months (95% CI: 17.5, not estimable).  
With regard to claims, due to the single-arm design, among all efficacy endpoints, only ORR can be 
interpreted in terms of a drug effect. Therefore, only ORR and DOR, as description of the responses, 
may be presented in the SmPC as claims. OS, PFS and CBR are only presented for descriptive reasons 
and are excluded as claims of drug effect since highly affected by tumour biology and prognosis, in this 
case further underscored by the highly exploratory nature of the study. Furthermore, BICR analyses 
have traditionally been used for non-randomised trials. In order to allow across-product comparison, 
the BICR results are therefore reflected in a footnote to the efficacy table in the SmPC.  
Given the exploratory character of the main study, some of the key issues for the present application 
concerned the external validity and robustness of the estimate of the primary efficacy outcome. An 
important issue for the present application concerns the risk of selection bias when a subset of patients 
from a larger context is selected for market approval, potentially causing an upward bias in the ORR 
estimate. The ORR for the other monotherapy cohorts were therefore requested and provided. It was 
notable that the results were better in the chosen primary efficacy population (n=81), with ORR (INV) 
at 36%, compared with ORRs at 12-14% for Cohorts A, B and MET-1 and 28% for Cohorts C. From this 
perspective, a potential upward bias is still an uncertainty for the ORR estimate.  
Scrutinised from a different perspective, the ORR estimate was found to be very consistent in the three 
different efficacy data sets available (n=39 at scientific advice, 81, and 144) and by the 4 different 
DCOs presented, including one in scientific advice. Across these analyses, BICR results (39-43%) were 
generally somewhat higher than INV results (36-37%).  
Analyses to investigate the stability of the ORR estimate showed a numerical decline in estimated ORR 
assessed by investigator towards the end of the study but a stable estimate for ORR assessed by BICR. 
Size of the treatment effect 
The reported ORR in second-line patients with NSCLC EFGR Exon20ins is low for an approval based on 
a single-arm trial. Accepted at face value, the ORR of 37% (95% CI: 28, 46%) would be considered 
relevant or even “good”, however. The DOR of 12 months is furthermore considered a clearly clinically 
relevant length of time under which disease progression is being delayed and symptoms of disease 
may potentially be alleviated.  
Evidence on EGFR mutated subgroups from the pivotal trials of other drugs, taken together, suggest 
that ORR in this subpopulation on available treatment alternatives may likely not be more than 20%, 
and most often less (See AR sections on current management and B/R, respectively).  
Subgroups 
Subgroup analysis showed activity of amivantamab irrespective of prior immunotherapy, with ORR at 
42% and 33% for patients with and without prior immunotherapy, respectively (Figure 12). 
Subgroup analysis indicated a possibly relevant difference (16%) in ORR between patients with ECOG 
performance status 0 and 1, respectively. This could theoretically be affected by line of therapy. No 
discernible biologically plausible pattern with regard to number of lines were noted, however. ECOG 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021  
Page 106/144 
 
 
 
 
 
performance status at baseline was also evaluated as covariate in the E-R analysis for ORR. A trend 
towards lower probability of response for subjects with ECOG 1 or 2 at baseline, relative to those with 
ECOG 0, was observed; however, this effect was not statistically significant (for further information, 
see section 3.3.2 Pharmacodynamics).  
Patients with untreated brain metastases were excluded from study participation. Regular follow-up 
imaging for CNS disease was not required by the protocol and intracranial responses were not 
assessed. Subjects with a prior history of brain/CNS metastases had similar overall response rate and 
duration of response as those without.  
The Applicant is recommended to submit results from any future data cut-offs from the pivotal Study 
EDI1001. Considering the maturity of the data submitted from study EDI1001, further analysis are not 
expected to contribute to the comprehensiveness of the data for Rybrevant. 
Supportive studies 
In the RWD study, the median OS in the first-line setting was 16.2 months in patients with Exon 20Ins 
and 25.5 months in patients with common EGFR mutations (cEGFR). This may likely reflect the use of 
highly potent EGFR-targeted drugs in first-line treatment of cEGFR-positive patients. In addition, it is 
noted that what would appear to be non-optimal drugs are being used to a non-negligible extent in 
first-line treatment of Exon 20Ins disease (Table 39). The median PFS on first EGFR TKI was 2.7 
months in patients with Exon 20Ins and 10.4 months in patients with common EGFR mutations, 
consistent with the reported lack of efficacy of approved TKIs in Exon 20Ins disease.  
In the RWD study, immunotherapies and non-platinum chemotherapies were mainly used in 2nd and 
3rd line treatment of Exon 20Ins disease, alongside platinum-based regimens. Only around 60% of 
patients with Exon 20Ins disease in the RWD study received a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen 
as e first-line therapy, which may be the only reasonably active treatment for this subset. The RWD 
estimations suggest a 2-5-month PFS and 9-14-month OS, in the second-line treatment of NSCLC with 
EGFR Exon 20ins, using presently approved therapies. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The main limitations in relation to the efficacy of amivantamab are related to the uncontrolled nature 
of the pivotal study which hampers the assessment of time-dependent endpoints such as PFS and OS. 
In cases with very high ORRs, the demonstration of such an impact may not be needed. This is not the 
case with ORR around 35-40%, however. Furthermore, while the ORR has been found stable in 
multiple DCOs and extensions of the efficacy analysis population to date, the total number of patients 
is still small (n=114) and a potential selection bias is still a concern.  
The Applicant will submit as a specific obligation (SOB) the results of study 61186372NSC3001, a 
randomized, open-label phase 3 study comparing amivantamab in combination with carboplatin-
pemetrexed therapy versus carboplatin-pemetrexed, in advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with 
activating EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations in the first-line setting.  Results from this study are 
intended to provide a comprehensive data package and potentially convert the conditional MA into a 
full MA.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The number of patients in the pivotal efficacy population is relatively small, with 114 subjects, but the 
consistence of the ORR estimate across the three consecutively increased efficacy analysis populations 
available, by four different DCOs, offers sufficient reassurance to allow approval.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021

Taken together, the reported outcomes of ORR 37% and DOR 12 months are considered compatible 
with clinical utility for use in the present disease and line of treatment.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
• 
In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of amivantamab in the treatment of adult 
patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations, the MAH 
should submit the results of study 61186372NSC3001, a randomized, open-label phase 3 study 
comparing amivantamab in combination with carboplatin-pemetrexed therapy versus 
carboplatin-pemetrexed, in advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with activating EGFR Exon 
20 insertion mutations in the first-line setting. The CSR should be submitted by 31 March 
2023.

2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
This MAA is based on a single study, the Phase 1 study EDI1001 (see section on clinical efficacy). 
Study EDI001 is a single-arm trial, and the safety evaluation must therefore be made without 
comparator.  
The Applicant’s Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) presents safety data primarily from the 362 subjects 
treated with amivantamab as monotherapy in either the dose escalation or dose expansion phases 
as of the clinical cut-off date of 08 June 2020.  
During the marketing authorisation application procedure, updated safety data was provided, as of the 
clinical cut-off date 30 March, 2021, which is approximately 10 additional months after the original 
data cut-off. Unless otherwise specified, the analyses from the updated data cut-off (30 March 2021) 
are presented below. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Extent and duration of exposure 
The safety analysis set included primarily the following subject populations from Study EDI1001 
(patient numbers from the updated data cut-off, 30 March 2021): 
•  All Treated (n=489): In the recently updated safety population with a cutoff of 30 March 
2021, 28.8% of the All Treated population remained on treatment with amivantamab and 
48.3% were still in the study, the most common reason for treatment discontinuation was still 
PD (57.7%) (Appendix TSIDS04 and Appendix TSIDS02). 
•  All Treated at RP2D (n=380): The updated All Treated at RP2D population was similar, with 
32.9% of subjects remaining on treatment at the cutoff and 52.4% were still in the study. As 
with the All Treated population, the most common reason for treatment discontinuation was PD 
(54.2%) (Appendix TSIDS04 and Appendix TSIDS02). 
•  Exon 20ins + prior chemotherapy at RP2D (n=153): In the updated safety population 
36.6% remained on treatment with amivantamab and 62.1% were still in the study. The 
percentage of subjects remaining on treatment dropped slightly from that seen with the 
previous cutoff date (from 57.0% to 36.6%; this reflected the completion of enrolment into 
this cohort during the interim). The most common reason for discontinuation remained PD 
(47.7%) (Appendix TSIDS04 and Appendix TSIDS02). 
The subject and treatment disposition at the updated data cut-off (30 March, 2021) is summarised in 
Table 40. Treatment duration at data cut-off is summarised in Table 41. A summary of the duration of 
follow-up is presented in Table 42.

Demographics and baseline disease characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were consistent across safety analysis populations. 
Prior and concomitant medications 
Prior and concomitant medications were as expected for the subject population and were consistent 
across analysis populations. 
Pre- and post-infusion treatment was administered to prevent and treat infusion-related reactions 
(IRRs). This is further described below.  
Other than pre- or post-infusion medications, the most common (≥30%) types of concomitant 
medications used (ATC Level 4 category) in the All Treated population were systemic glucocorticoids, 
tetracycline antibiotics, anilide analgesics (eg, paracetamol), natural opioid alkaloids, and proton pump 
inhibitors.  
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Safety monitoring was the same for both Part1 and Part 2 of study EDI1001, and included evaluation 
of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities (haematology, clinical chemistry), which were 
graded per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-
CTCAE), Version 4.03. Other safety measures include monitoring of vital signs (temperature, pulse 
rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry), ECGs, and physical examinations.  
All AEs whether serious or non-serious, were reported from the time a signed and dated ICF was 
obtained until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, until the subject withdrew consent for 
study participation, or until the subject started subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurred 
first. Subjects who discontinued the study drug due to drug-related toxicity were to be continually 
monitored for this toxicity until the toxicity resolved to Grade ≤1 or baseline, stabilised, or was 
deemed irreversible, the subject died, or subsequent anti-cancer therapy was started, whichever 
occurred first. Adverse events occurring >30days following the last dose of study drug (and their 
resolution) were also to be reported if the investigator considered them related to study drug.

Common adverse events 
In addition to infusion related reactions (IRR), the safety profile of amivantamab was consistent with 
EGFR and MET inhibition. The main reported AEs were therefore IRR, dermatitis, paronychia and rash, 
none of which was dose limiting and were primarily Grade 1 or 2 in severity. 
The safety profile of amivantamab monotherapy in the All treated at RP2D population and Exon 20ins 
+ prior chemotherapy at RP2D population are consistent with All Treated population. 
Table 43 presents an overall summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the safety 
populations at both data cut-offs. Of the 489 subjects in the All Treated population, all but 2 subjects 
experienced TEAEs and most subjects (96.3%) had at least 1 TEAE considered by the investigator to 
be related to amivantamab. A consistent overall safety profile for amivantamab monotherapy was 
observed among subjects in the All Treated at RP2D population and subjects in the Exon 20ins + prior 
chemotherapy at RP2D population comparted to the All Treated population. Table 44 summarises the 
most common TEAEs (listed by frequency of 10% or higher) in any of the three safety populations 
at the data cut-off 30 March, 2021.  
Covid-19 
There were five COVID-19-related TEAEs reported in the All Treated population, were all non-serious.

Adverse Drug Reactions for labelling 
The All Treated at RP2D population (n=380) with a data cut-off date of 30 March 2021 was used as 
basis when considering AEs for inclusion in the label (section 4.8 of the SmPC).  
•  All TEAEs reported in ≥10% of subjects were considered to have met the ADR threshold, 
except the PTs that are consistent with signs and/or symptoms of the underlying disease 
•  All serious TEAEs, including all fatal events, were reviewed 
• 
• 
TEAEs by severity were reviewed for safety trends 
TEAEs that led to dose modification were reviewed for safety trends 
•  All laboratory parameters were reviewed. One of the 3 criteria listed below was used:  
o  TEAEs with ≥10% incidence, or 
o 
Laboratory abnormalities (≥ 20%) that worsened from baseline and demonstrated 
consistent up or down trend based on mean values over time, or 
o  Had biological plausibility and demonstrated consistent up or down trend based on 
mean values over time 
•  Similar medical concepts were grouped by MedDRA PTs. 
Table 45 summarizes the adverse drug reactions that occurred in patients receiving amivantamab 
(section 4.8 of the SmPC).  
The data reflects exposure to amivantamab in 380 patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients received 
amivantamab 1,050 mg (for patients < 80 kg) or 1,400 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg). The median 
exposure to amivantamab was 4.1 months (range: 0.0 to 39.7 months). 
Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency 
categories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon 
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); and not known 
(frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).  
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing 
seriousness.

2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Deaths occurring within the treatment phase (up through 30 days after last dose) and reported as 
Grade 5 AEs were infrequent in all 3 analysis populations (4.7% in All Treated, 5.3% in All Treated at 
RP2D, and 7.2% in Exon 20ins + prior chemotherapy at RP2D), there was no trend to the TEAEs 
leading to death, and all events were reported by the investigator as being unrelated to amivantamab.  
Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events 
A total of 141 (28.8%) subjects in the All Treated population had a serious TEAE (including the fatal 
events, discussed above).  The most common SAEs were pneumonia and dyspnoea . All reported 
serious events of pneumonia and dyspnoea were assessed as unrelated by the investigator.  
There were 12 Grade 4 serious TEAEs in this population (dyspnoea, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, 
IRR, brain oedema). There were 23 Grade 5 serious TEAEs. As described above, all Grade 5 TEAEs 
were considered unrelated to amivantamab. 
Serious TEAEs in the All Treated population that were suggested as related to amivantamab included 
IRR, pneumonitis, rash, dermatitis acneiform, diarrhoea, and interstitial lung disease, pulmonary 
embolism, cellulitis, impetigo, infected dermal cyst, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vomiting, atrial flutter, 
pericardial effusion, myalgia, conjunctival granuloma, fatigue.  
2.6.8.4.  Adverse events leading to dose modifications 
Dose reductions 
Dose reduction due to an AE was made in 12.1% of subjects in the All treated population. Among the 
151 subjects in the Exon 20 Ins + Prior Chemotherapy group (target population), treated at the RP2D, 
dose reductions due to AE were made in 22 subjects (14.4%). TEAEs within the grouped term Rash 
(See Adverse events of special interest below) were the most common events leading to dose 
modification in all three safety analysis populations. Of note, the study protocol recommended that 
investigators consider dose reduction at a Grade 2 AE within the grouped term “Rash”.  
Dose interruptions 
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to drug interruption includes AEs (other than IRRs) that had an 
action taken of “drug interrupted” and reflected either an interruption of an ongoing infusion or 
interruption of amivantamab administration (eg, skipped infusion). 
A total of 155 subjects (31.7%) in the All Treated population had a TEAE (other than IRR) that resulted 
in dose interruption through the clinical cutoff. Dose interruption due to events that were considered 
related to amivantamab were made in 82 subjects (16.8%).  
There were 36 patients (9.5%) who had both a dose interruption and a dose reduction.  
 Infusion modifications 
A total of 304 subjects (62.2%) in the All Treated population had a TEAE that resulted in infusion 
modification through the clinical cutoff, with the predominant of these TEAEs being IRR (reported for 
301 subjects). Almost all IRRs occurred during the Cycle 1, Day 1 infusion.  
IRRs are discussed in more detail below. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 117/144 
 
 
 
2.6.8.1.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 39 subjects (8.0%) in the All Treated population had a TEAE leading to treatment 
discontinuation and in 21 subjects (4.3%), the TEAE was assessed as related to amivantamab, 
including: IRRs (8 subjects, 1.6%); pneumonitis (3 subjects, 0.6%); paronychia and stomatitis (2 
subjects each, 0.4%); and skin laceration, dyspnoea, pulmonary embolism, dermatitis acneiform, toxic 
epidermal necrolysis, hypoalbuminemia, asthenia, myalgia, and akathisia (1 subject each, 0.2%). 
Events considered not related included pneumonia, other infections, pleural effusion, and single events 
of muscular weakness, musculoskeletal chest pain, CNS haemorrhage and hypotension.  
The overall frequencies of TEAEs leading to discontinuation (any event and related events) in the All 
Treated at RP2D and Exon 20ins + prior chemotherapy at RP2D treated populations were consistent 
with that reported for the All Treated population. 
The incidence and nature of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was also consistent across the 
updated safety population (30 March 2021) and the MAA safety population (8 June, 2020). 
Adverse events of special interest 
The Applicant considered the following adverse events as being of specific clinical importance:  
- 
- 
rash (grouped term), class effect of EGFR inhibitors 
IRR, known effect at infusion of antibody treatment 
-  peripheral oedema (grouped term), class effect of MET inhibitors 
- 
ILD (grouped term), an effect associated with EGFR inhibitors 
These events were reported in 76.5%, 64.4%, 19.3%, and 2.8% of subjects in the All Treated 
population and 86.0%, 65.8%, 19.3%, and 4.4% of subjects in the Exon 20ins + prior chemotherapy 
at RP2D population, respectively.  
In addition, the following additional EGFR-mediated events were specifically discussed: 
- 
Paronychia 
-  Diarrhoea 
- 
Eye disorders 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) 
IRRs were reported for 67% of subjects in the All Treated population, with 2.0% of subjects 
experiencing events of Grade 3 or higher. Serious IRR events occurred in 6 subjects (1.2%).  
In general, these events (characterised predominantly by symptoms of dyspnoea, flushing, chills, 
nausea, chest discomfort, and vomiting) were of mild or moderate severity, non-serious and not 
treatment-limiting. There were no Grade 5 events. 
In total, 66% of subjects experienced an IRR on Week 1 Day 1, 3.9% of subjects experienced an IRR 
with the Day 2 infusion, 1.5% of subjects experienced an IRR with the Day 8 infusion, and 
cumulatively 1.5% with subsequent infusions. The median time to onset was 60 minutes after start of 
first infusion.  
Most IRRs were managed with a modification of the ongoing infusion, and few required post-infusion 
treatments. The incidence of infusion modifications due to IRR was 62% and 1.6% of subjects 
permanently discontinued amivantamab due to IRR. No subject had dose reduction due to IRR. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 118/144 
 
 
 
IRRs were prophylactically managed through use of split dosing of the first dose (Cycle 1) over Days 1 
and 2 and the administration of select drugs. Furthermore, algorithms were provided to the 
investigators to assist in the management of any IRRs that did occur during or after infusion. 
Rash TEAEs (Grouped Term) 
In the All treated safety population (n=489): Rash events (grouped term) were the most common 
category of TEAEs reported in All Treated population (75.1%), with rash (35.6%) and dermatitis 
acneiform (34.6%), being the most frequent specific events observed. In general, the majority of the 
rash events were of Grade 1 or 2 severity and non-serious; 18 (3.7%) subjects experienced an event 
with the highest grade of Grade 3. Four (0.8%) subjects had serious rash events.  
The median time to onset of rash was 14 days. 
Rash leading to dose reduction occurred in 1.6% of subjects, and study drug was permanently 
discontinued due to dermatitis acneiform in 0.2% of subjects. A case of serious toxic epidermal 
necrolysis (TEN) occurred in 1 subject (0.2%).   
Interstitial Lung Disease (Grouped Term) 
Thirteen subjects (2.7%) in the All Treated population had treatment-emergent ILD events. Three 
(0.6%) and 7 (1.4%) subjects experienced Grade 3 and serious ILD/pneumonitis events, respectively.  
Peripheral Oedema 
Peripheral oedema TEAEs (grouped term) were reported for 22% of subjects. Grade 1 was reported in 
16% of subjects. Twenty-four (4.9%) subjects experienced an event with the highest grade of Grade 2 
and four (0.8%) subjects experienced an event with the highest grade of Grade 3. There were no 
peripheral oedema SAEs. For almost all events amivantamab dose remained unchanged (there were 2 
events where the dose was reduced); no subjects discontinued due to peripheral oedema. 
Paronychia 
Paronychia occurred in 42.5% (208 subjects) of the All treated population. Most events were Grades 1 
or 2, with Grade 3 paronychia occurring in 10 (2.0%) subjects. Paronychia led to discontinuation of 
study agent in 2 subjects (0.4%). None of the events were serious.  
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea occurred in 11% of the All Treated population. Most events were Grade 1 or 2. Seven 
subjects had Grade 3 events. Two subjects experienced events of serious diarrhoea for which they 
were hospitalised and amivantamab was interrupted. One of these subjects was experiencing ongoing 
diarrhoea at the end of study (treatment discontinuation). Both of these subjects were in the Exon 
20ins + prior chemotherapy at RP2D population.  
Eye Disorders 
Eye disorders occurred in 12% of the All Treated population. The most frequently reported TEAEs 
were dry eye (3.3%), vision blurred (1.2%), and eye pruritis (1.2%). Keratitis occurred at a frequency 
of 0.5% (2 subjects), with one event considered related to amivantamab by the investigator and which 
led to amivantamab dose interruption. All events were Grade 1-2, except 1 event of vision blurred was 
Grade 3. Three subjects experienced events of serious eye disorders including retinal artery occlusion, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 119/144 
 
 
 
conjunctival granuloma and vision blurred. One event of vision blurred led to discontinuation of study 
agent.   
2.6.8.2.  Laboratory findings 
Note: Laboratory findings are reported based on data provided in the original MAA submission (data 
cut-off 8 June, 2020). The updated data from the cutoff 30 March 2021 were overall in agreement with 
the originally presented data.  
For haematology parameters (haemoglobin, leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, platelets) and 
clinical chemistry parameters, the worst on treatment toxicity grades in the All treated population are 
summarised in Table 46.  
Grade 3 haematology laboratory abnormalities during the study were infrequent (<3%) except for low 
lymphocyte counts, where Grade 3 abnormalities were observed for 34 subjects (9.6%). Of these 34 
subjects, 27 had a shift from Grade 0, 1, or 2 at baseline to Grade 3 on treatment. The overall trend 
was, however, a small increase in mean lymphocyte count from baseline over time. Lymphopenia was 
reported as AE in 3.6% of the All treated population but was, by the investigator, suggested related to 
amivantamab in only 1.4%. 
Hypoalbuminaemia and increased aminotransferases are further discussed below.

Hypoalbuminaemia 
Hypoalbuminemia is a suspected consequence of the MET inhibition effect on hepatocyte protein 
synthesis. Albumin is the predominate protein that regulates the osmotic pressure in the blood vessels. 
Thus, when decreased albumin levels may result in peripheral oedema.  
In Study EDI1001 the serum albumin levels over time on treatment showed an expected decrease in 
albumin levels over the first 2 treatment cycles of approximately 7 to 8 g/L; thereafter, albumin levels 
tended to stabilise for the remainder of the time on treatment (Figure 20).  
Hypoalbuminemia AEs were reported for 149 subjects (30.5%) in the All Treated population, 115 
subjects (30.3%) in the All Treated at RP2D population and 60 subjects (39.2%) in the Exon 20ins + 
prior chemotherapy at RP2D treated population (Table 44; March 2021 cutoff). Hypoalbuminemia 
laboratory values were mostly Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 hypoalbuminemia was experienced by 13 
subjects (3.7%) in the All treated population. No subjects had Grade 4 hypoalbuminemia.

Analysis Set in Monotherapy (data cut-off 8 June, 2020) 
Hepatoxicity (Increased Aminotransferases) 
EGFR and MET signalling play complex and important roles in the maintenance of hepatic liver repair 
and regeneration. Aminotransferase elevations, including rare reports of hepatic failure with fatal 
outcomes, have been observed with the small-molecule EGFR tyrosine inhibitors.  
Elevations of ALT and AST were observed during amivantamab treatment (including one Grade 4 ALT 
increase), however, there have been no confirmed cases of drug-induced liver injury (or subjects 
meeting Hy’s law criteria) with amivantamab (Table 46).  
The majority of cases were Grade 1. The more serious cases described by the Applicant had other 
possible explanations (liver metastases, cholelithiasis). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 121/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Electrocardiograms 
Within each treated population, approximately 65% of subjects with baseline ECG data had 
corresponding ECG data for the Cycle 2, Day 1 pre-dose timepoint and approximately 12 to 16% of 
subjects had corresponding ECG data for the Cycle 2, Day 1 post-dose timepoint (representing Cmax). 
Mean and median changes from baseline in all three treated populations were not considered clinically 
meaningful. 
2.6.8.3.  Safety in special populations 
Age 
In the All Treated population, subjects <65 years and 65 to 74 years of age accounted for 58.7% and 
29.9%, respectively. Subjects 75 to 84 years and 85+ years of age accounted for 10.9% (N=53) and 
0.6% (N=3), respectively, in the All Treated population. Interpretation of potential differences in safety 
profiles using subjects 75 to 84 years of age and those 85+ years was difficult due to small sample 
size and lack of a comparator group.  
The overall TEAE profile among subjects <65 and those 65 to 74 years of age in the All Treated 
population was generally similar. There was no apparent difference in the overall frequency of TEAEs; 
related TEAEs; Grade 3 or higher TEAEs; or TEAEs leading to dose reduction, infusion modification, 
discontinuation, or death as a function of age for this population (difference in frequency <10%).  
Although there was a higher incidence (difference >10%) of TEAEs leading to dose interruption and 
serious TEAEs among the 65 to 74 years subgroup compared with the <65 years subgroup, the 
incidence of related TEAEs leading to dose interruption and related serious TEAEs was similar 
(difference <10%).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 122/144 
 
 
 
Sex 
Women represented 63% of the All Treated population. The overall TEAE profile in men and women 
was generally similar. There was higher frequency of rash among men (>10% difference). Among 
individual common TEAEs (>20% in either sex) dermatitis acneiform was reported at higher frequency 
in men (men 40.9% and women 30.8%).  
The difference between women and men for Grade 3 or higher TEAEs was < 5% (42.5% for women 
and 37.6% for men). Furthermore, the frequency of related Grade 3 or higher TEAEs remained similar 
for both sexes. 
No major difference in TEAEs was observed between males and females when comparing subsets 
within the RP2D dose (1050 mg for <80 kg and 1400 mg for ≥80 kg). 
Race 
Race was reported for 94.5% of subjects; 61% of the population was Asian. 
The frequencies of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs and related Grade 3 or higher AEs, as well as TEAEs 
leading to dose reduction (including related dose reduction), dose interruption, or infusion modification 
(including related infusion modification) were consistently higher for the non-Asian subgroup compared 
with the Asian subgroup in the All Treated population (differences of 10% or higher). Data did, 
however, not reveal any single AE or cluster of AEs accounting for the observed differences between 
Asian and non- Asian subjects. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 123/144 
 
 
 
 
Among the most commonly reported TEAEs, the frequencies of IRRs and dermatitis acneiform were 
higher (difference of >10%) for the non-Asian subgroup, while the frequency of paronychia and rash 
were higher for the Asian subgroup. Other common (>20% in either racial subgroup) TEAEs for which 
there was a reporting difference (>10%) were fatigue, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting, all of which 
were reported at higher frequencies in non-Asian compared with Asian subjects. 
In addition, no major difference in TEAEs was observed between Asians and non-Asians when 
comparing subsets within the RP2D dose (1050 mg for <80kg and 1400 mg for ≥80kg). 
Weight 
The overall tolerability profile was generally consistent for the two RP2D amivantamab doses 
administered (1050 mg and 1400 mg), with the possible exception of higher rates of TEAEs leading to 
dose reduction or infusion modification at the 1400 mg dose level, and higher rates of TEAEs leading to 
dose interruption at the 1050 mg dose level. 
Renal Impairment 
No formal studies of amivantamab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. In the 3 All 
Treated population, approximately half of the patients had normal baseline renal function. Of the 
remaining subjects, most had mild renal impairment, and a few had moderate renal impairment. 
There was no apparent difference in the overall frequency of TEAEs, related TEAEs, or TEAEs leading to 
dose reduction, infusion modification, discontinuation, or death between subjects with normal renal 
function and those with mild or moderate renal impairment (difference in frequency <10%). However, 
the frequency of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, related Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, and serious TEAEs was 
higher in subjects with moderate renal impairment compared with those with normal renal function or 
mild renal impairment. The frequency of subjects with dose interruption was higher in subjects with 
moderate renal impairment compared with those with normal renal function. 
Given the large molecular mass of amivantamab (~148kD), its clearance is not anticipated to be 
affected by decreased renal function. No dosage adjustment is considered necessary for impaired 
patients with mild to moderately decreased renal function.  
Hepatic Impairment 
No formal studies of amivantamab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. 
Amivantamab clearance is not anticipated to be affected by decreased hepatic function. In the All 
Treated population, most subjects had normal baseline hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST 
≤ ULN). The number of subjects with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN) 
or (ULN < total bilirubin ≤ 1.5× ULN) was approximately 10% at baseline.  
There was no apparent difference in the overall frequency of TEAEs, related TEAEs, TEAEs with an 
outcome of death, Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, serious TEAEs, or TEAEs leading to dose reduction, 
infusion modification, dose interruption, or discontinuation of study agent between subjects with 
normal hepatic function and mild hepatic impairment (difference in frequency <10%).

2.6.8.4.  Immunological events 
Immunogenicity 
In the All Treated population, 347 subjects had at least 1 post baseline sample. Of these, only 3 
(1.0%) subjects were considered positive for antibodies to amivantamab post-dose. One subject who 
received 350 mg of amivantamab had a titer of 1:10 at their follow up visit, 168 days after the first 
amivantamab administration. Another subject who received 1400 mg amivantamab had a 1:20 titer 59 
days after the first amivantamab administration. Another subject who received 1400 mg amivantamab 
had a 1:40 titer 27 days after the first amivantamab administration.  
The shape of the serum concentration-time profiles of the antibodies to amivantamab-positive subjects 
was consistent with the serum concentration-time profiles of the antibodies to amivantamab-negative 
subjects. There was no apparent association between the development of antibodies to antibody and 
the development of IRR.  
The small number of subjects in each group of antibody titer level precludes drawing a definite 
conclusion regarding the impact of antibody titer levels on the clinical efficacy and safety of 
amivantamab. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with amivantamab. 
Dose-finding results (Part 1 of Study EDI1001) 
The safety analysis set from part I, the dose-finding part of the study, included a total of 77 subjects 
who received at least one dose of amivantamab. The maximum administered dose for amivantamab 
monotherapy in Part 1 was 1750 mg. No dose-limiting toxicity was identified up to the 1400 mg 
amivantamab dose in Korea. One of the initial US subjects in the 1050 mg dose cohort experienced a 
Grade 3 toxicity of myalgia, which met DLT criteria. This was the only AE meeting DLT criteria in 
Part 1. Thus, the MTD for amivantamab as monotherapy was not established. 
A total of 12 subjects (15.6%) treated in Part 1 had a TEAE that resulted in a dose reduction, with all 
such events occurring in dose cohorts of 700 mg and higher and the highest incidence in the 1750 mg 
cohort (14.3%, 12.0%, 15.4%, and 50.0% of subjects in 700 mg, 1050 mg, 1400 mg, and 1750 mg 
cohorts, respectively). 
Results from Part 1 may therefore indicate that amivantamab at monotherapy doses up to 1750 mg 
had an acceptable safety profile. The majority of TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, with low rates of 
dose reduction (15.6%), discontinuation (9.1%), or related Grade 3 or higher events (11.7%). Two 
subjects (2.6%) had Grade 4 TEAEs, and few subjects (n=2) had TEAEs with an outcome of death. All 
Grade 4 and Grade 5 TEAEs in Part 1 were assessed as unrelated to study treatment. 
The safety profile for amivantamab monotherapy in Part 1 was consistent with other agents that inhibit 
EGFR and MET pathways, with dermatitis acneiform, paronychia, rash, hypoalbuminemia, and 
stomatitis being observed in >15% of all subjects treated in this phase.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety evaluation of amivantamab is primarily based on the 489 patients receiving amivantamab 
monotherapy in Study EGI1001 (denoted the All treated population).  
At time of submission of this initial MAA, an interim analysis (data cut-off 8 June, 2020) was provided. 
As the duration of treatment and median follow-up was then still short, an updated analysis (cut-off 
date 30 March, 2021) was provided during the evaluation, which meant an additional approximately 10 
months follow-up. The updated safety information was overall consistent with the original analysis.   
The safety evaluation is somewhat hampered by the lack of a control group, but this is considered 
acceptable in the currently applied indication.  
Common adverse events 
The safety profile of amivantamab was overall consistent with its on-target activity against both EGFR 
and MET pathways. Thus, many of the commonly reported AEs (≥10% of subjects) were known 
reactions to EGFR inhibition (dermatitis acneiform, rash, pruritus, dry skin, stomatitis, paronychia) or 
to MET inhibition (hypoalbuminaemia, peripheral oedema). Other AEs occurring in ≥10% of subjects 
were GI disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation), and general disorders such as 
pyrexia and fatigue.  
The most commonly reported AE (preferred term), however, was infusion-related reaction (IRR), which 
can be expected for an antibody treatment. IRR occurred in around 2/3 of subjects in all three safety 
analysis populations. IRR of ≥Grade 3 occurred in about 2% of subjects, indicating that severe 
reactions could most often be prevented by prophylactic treatment. A relatively small percent of 
subjects (<10%) required post-infusion treatment to manage toxicity (i.e. within 48 hr after infusion).  
The following commonly reported adverse reactions can be considered not related to amivantamab: 
dyspnoea, cough, myalgia, back pain, dizziness, headache, decreased appetite, increased ALT/ALP, 
pyrexia.  
Grade ≥3 AEs were reported in 41% of subjects in the All treated safety population. In most of these 
cases the highest reported grade was Grade 3. The most common AEs of Grade ≥3 that were 
considered related to treatment with amivantamab (by the investigator) were diarrhoea and 
neutropenia, paronychia, dermatitis acneiform and IRR. Overall, the rate and nature of Grade ≥3 AEs 
is not of specific concern.  
The SmPC Section 4.8 reflects data from exposure to amivantamab in 380 patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. The 
most frequent adverse reactions all grades in this population were rash (76%), infusion related 
reactions (67%), nail toxicity (47%), hypoalbuminaemia (31%), oedema (26%), fatigue (26%), 
stomatitis (24%), nausea (23%), and constipation (23%). Serious adverse reactions included ILD 
(1.3%), IRR (1.1%), and rash (1.1%). Three percent of patients discontinued Rybrevant due to 
adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were IRR 
(1.1%), ILD (0.5%), and nail toxicity (0.5%). 
Deaths and serious adverse events 
The majority of deaths during the study were due to progressive disease. None of the deaths that 
occurred during or within 30 days after amivantamab treatment were considered related to 
amivantamab treatment by the investigators. Overall, the pattern of deaths does not give raise to 
concern in a NSCLC population. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 126/144 
 
 
 
Among the totally 141 patients with serious adverse events during treatment with amivantamab 
monotherapy (All treated population, n=489), the events were by the investigator considered related 
to amivantamab in 27 patients (5.5%). The latter included rash, dermatitis acneiform, diarrhoea, 
interstitial lung disease, pulmonary embolism, cellulitis, impetigo, infected dermal cyst, toxic epidermal 
necrolysis, vomiting, atrial flutter, pericardial effusion, myalgia, conjunctival granuloma, fatigue.  
The Applicant reviewed all serious events for potential inclusion in the SmPC as ADR. Serious events 
not considered treatment-related were reported primarily within the SOCs ‘Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders’ and ’Infections and infestations’, and included dyspnoea (11), pulmonary 
embolism (5), pleural effusion (4), pneumothorax (4), respiratory failure (4), pneumonia (12), and 
respiratory tract infection (3). It is agreed that these events may be considered possibly or likely 
related to the underlying NSCLC.  
Dose modifications  
Dose reductions were made in 12% of subjects in the All treated population. Events within the SOC 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders within the grouped term ‘rash’, such as dermatitis acneiform 
and rash, were the most common reasons for dose reductions. The second most common reason was 
events within SOC Infections and infestations (most commonly paronychia). Overall, there were few 
dose reductions due to other TEAEs than those that could be attributed to EGFR inhibition.  
Dose interruption due to an AE was made in about 30% of subjects in the All treated population and 
was, thus, a more common dose modification than dose reduction. The most common reactions that 
led to dose interruption in the All treated safety populations included known reactions related to EGFR 
inhibition such as dermatitis acneiform, rash paronychia. Other reactions that were, in all cases, 
considered related to amivantamab by the investigator were neutropenia, fatigue and pneumonitis. 
Pneumonia was also commonly reported but was in none of the cases considered related to 
amivantamab. 
Thus, in summary, dose interruption was made in about 30% and dose reduction in about 12% of 
subjects in the All treated population. In 9.5% both a dose interruption and a dose reduction were 
made. The most common reason for dose modification was reactions related to EGFR inhibition. The 
degree of and reasons for dose modification appears not to be of concern.  
Modification of infusion was made in about 62% of subjects, the vast majority of cases were due to 
IRR.  
Treatment discontinuations 
In the All treatment population the rate of treatment discontinuation due to an AE was 8%. In about 
half of these subjects, treatment discontinuation was made due to an AE that was considered related 
to amivantamab. These events included mainly IRR and events associated with EGFR inhibition such as 
paronychia, dermatitis acneiform, stomatitis. There was also one serious event reported as toxic 
epidermal necrolysis, which was considered related to amivantamab by the investigator and led to 
treatment discontinuation.  
Events leading to treatment discontinuation that were not considered related to amivantamab were 
mainly reported within SOC Infections and infestations, and there were some events of pleural effusion 
and musculoskeletal disorders. Overall, the same pattern in terms of AEs was observed for treatment 
discontinuations as for dose modifications and is not of major concern.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 127/144 
 
 
 
Discussion of specific adverse events 
Infusion-related reactions  
IRR is a known risk with antibody treatment, and IRRs were very common at amivantamab treatment. 
About 2/3 of subjects in the All treated population experienced IRR. The reactions were generally of 
grade 1-2 and could in most cases be managed by infusion modification. IRR of ≥Grade 3 occurred in 
about 3% of subjects in the All treated population, indicating that severe reactions could most often be 
prevented. Post-infusion medications were needed for about 10% of the study subjects. IRR is included 
as Important identified risk in the RMP. The risk and its handling are considered sufficiently well 
described in the SmPC.  
Rash (grouped term) 
Rash and other dermatologic side effects are frequently reported with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
Events within the grouped term rash was also commonly reported with amivantamab treatment, in 
about 3/4 of all subjects treated with at least one dose of amivantamab monotherapy. About half of 
the subjects with rash had more than 1 event, and about 25% had 3 or more events of rash. In most 
cases, the reactions were mild and non-serious. The reactions generally resolved on treatment or after 
dose interruption/dose reduction, and treatment discontinuation due to rash was made in two subjects. 
Eighteen subjects (3.7%) had a Grade 3 event. All Grade 3 reactions resolved, but in one case of toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN), it led to treatment discontinuation. This TEAE was considered serious and 
probably related to amivantamab due to a plausible time to onset.  
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) 
ILD and ILD-like AEs have previously been associated with EGFR TKI use. There were 13 cases 
reported as ILD or pneumonitis at amivantamab monotherapy in the All treated population (n=489). 
Seven cases were considered serious. The risk of ILD and its handling is adequately described in 
section 4.4 of the proposed amivantamab SmPC, and the recommendations are in line with those given 
for other EGFR inhibitors.  
Peripheral oedema 
MET inhibition has been associated with peripheral oedema, with hypoalbuminaemia as a possible 
contributor. Peripheral oedema was observed in about 20% of the 489 subjects treated with 
amivantamab monotherapy. Some of the subjects had a preceding hypoalbuminaemia. The reactions 
were in most cases mild. None of the events were considered serious. In two subjects, the event led to 
dose reduction, but there were no treatment discontinuations due to peripheral oedema. Thus, overall, 
the peripheral oedema events appear to have been in most cases manageable and tolerable without 
leading to modification of amivantamab treatment. Peripheral oedema and hypoalbuminaemia are 
adequately listed as ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Paronychia 
Paronychia is an expected event due to EGFR inhibition and occurred in 42% of subjects treated with 
amivantamab monotherapy. The reactions appear to have been generally manageable by dose 
interruption. 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea is very commonly reported with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and was also observed with 
amivantamab. Of the 54 patients (11% of the All treated with amivantamab monotherapy population) 
experiencing diarrhoea, most events were Grade 1-2, with 7 subjects having a Grade 3 event. There 
were two serious events which led to hospitalisation.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 128/144 
 
 
 
Eye disorders    
Eye disorders is a known ADR from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and was also observed with 
amivantamab, in 12% of the All treated population.  
Hypoalbuminaemia 
Hypoalbuminaemia was reported as AE for 30% of subjects. Clinical chemistry data, however, 
indicated a change (decrease) from baseline in albumin in in a larger part of patients. The 
hypoalbuminemia was generally mild-moderate. Hypoalbuminaemia did in no case lead to dose 
modification or treatment discontinuation.   
Hepatotoxicity (increased aminotransferases) 
Increases in aminotransferases may be expected by an agent inhibiting EGFR and MET. The majority of 
cases were Grade 1. No case met criteria for Hy’s law. The more serious cases had other possible 
explanations (liver metastases, cholelithiasis). Hepatotoxicity is included as an important potential risk 
in the list of Safety concerns in the RMP, which is considered adequate. 
Effects on QT interval 
Based on currently available data the potential of amivantamab to cause QT prolongation is considered 
low.  
Dose finding 
The safety analysis set from part I, the dose-finding part of the study, included a total of 77 subjects 
who received at least one dose of amivantamab.  
Only one subject experienced toxicity that met the DLT criteria during the dose-finding part of the 
study, at the 1050 mg dose. A MTD was not defined. 
There was no discernible pattern of dose dependency for on-target AEs, grad ≥3 events, dose 
interruptions or treatment discontinuations over the dose range 1050-1750 mg. A total of 12 subjects 
(15.6%) treated in Part 1 had a TEAE that resulted in a dose reduction, with all such events occurring 
in dose cohorts of 700 mg and higher and the highest incidence in the 1750 mg cohort (14.3%, 
12.0%, 15.4%, and 50.0% of subjects in 700 mg, 1050 mg, 1400 mg, and 1750 mg cohorts, 
respectively). However, the number of subjects in the highest dose group was only 6 and no 
conclusions can be drawn with regard to a potential lower tolerability at the 1750 mg dose. 
Safety in special populations 
Age: Of the 489 subjects in the All treated population, 30 subjects ≥ 65 and < 75 years of age and 
11% were ≥ 75 years. Due to the relatively low number of subjects ≥ 75 years, no separate subgroup 
analysis was made for this group. The overall AE profile was similar between older and younger 
subjects, however, there was a trend towards a higher incidence of SAEs in the elderly.  
Sex: The overall TEAE profile in men and women was generally similar.  
Race: Study EDI1001 included 217 Asian and 125 Non-Asian subjects in the All treated with 
amivantamab monotherapy safety population. The rate of serious TEAEs, ≥Grade 3 TEAEs, and TEAEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation or dose modification were consistently higher for the Non-Asian 
subjects in this population. This included TEAEs considered related to amivantamab. However, these 
differences do not imply that different dosing strategies should be used or that specific warnings 
should be given based on race. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 129/144 
 
 
 
The differences in the All treated Asian and non-Asian populations may also reflect differences in study 
conduct and enrolled population, as the initial Part 1 Dose Escalation (NSCLC) and initial Part 2 Cohorts 
A and B were conducted in Korea, prior to the global expansion of the study, and opening of Cohorts C, 
D, MET-1, and MET-2. Correspondingly, when the Asian and non-Asian analysis is limited to the more 
uniform Exon 20ins + prior chemotherapy at RP2D, these differences in race-specific safety 
profiles were not observed. The rates of EGFR and MET toxicities were also similar between Asians and 
non-Asians. 
Weight: The effect of weight on amivantamab PK is discussed in the Pharmacokinetic AR. 
Renal impairment: Renal impairment might not be expected to affect the elimination and the PK of 
amivantamab. The higher frequency of ≥Grade 3 AEs (including AEs considered treatment related) and 
AEs leading to dose interruption in patients with moderate renal impairment as compared with patients 
with mild impairment or normal renal function might rather be due to a higher vulnerability of these 
subjects. The proposed SmPC gives no specific dosing instructions for patients with moderate renal 
impairment, which is considered adequate as these patients can likely be handled by the same dose 
modification strategies as other patients. Caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment 
as there is no data in this population.  
Hepatic impairment: Hepatic impairment might also not be expected to affect the elimination and the 
PK of amivantamab, and mild hepatic impairment did not have apparent effects on the safety profile. 
As for renal impairment, patients with hepatic disease might possibly be more susceptible to adverse 
reactions, related or not related to amivantamab. Caution is advised in patients with moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment as there is no data in this population.  
Immunogenicity 
The number of subjects with anti-amivantamab antibodies was low (1%) and that their antibody titres 
were low. Data are too limited to draw any conclusions on the potential effect of antibodies on the PK, 
efficacy or safety of amivantamab. 
Drug-drug interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with amivantamab. Pharmacokinetic 
drug-drug interactions might not be expected for an antibody.  
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
Additional safety data including comparative data will be provided as part of the specific obligation in 
order to fulfil a CMA. Study 61186372NSC3001 will allow a better characterisation of the long-term 
safety and a contextualisation of the safety data compared to the control arm. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Amivantamab is a new, bispecific monoclonal antibody with well-known targets, EGFR and MET. 
Overall, the safety profile of amivantamab was consistent with EGFR and MET inhibition, and TEAEs 
due the pharmacological action was generally manageable by dose modifications (dose interruption 
and/or dose reduction) and/or specific treatment, e.g. of rash. There was also a high degree of 
infusion-related reactions, which can be expected for an antibody. Most of the IRRs were of NCI-CTCAE 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 130/144 
 
 
 
Grade 1 and 2. This could generally be managed by pre- and post-infusion medication and by 
modification of infusion.   
The presented safety data is considered sufficient for assessment of the risks of the product. From the 
safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
• 
In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of amivantamab in the treatment of adult 
patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations, the MAH 
should submit the results of study 61186372NSC3001, a randomized, open-label phase 3 study 
comparing amivantamab in combination with carboplatin-pemetrexed therapy versus 
carboplatin-pemetrexed, in advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with activating EGFR Exon 
20 insertion mutations in the first-line setting. The CSR should be submitted by 31 March 
2023.

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version v 1.2 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 21.05.2021. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, RYBREVANT (amivantamab) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as: 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 133/144 
 
 
 
 
• 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a] 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Indication endorsed by CHMP: 
•  RYBREVANT as monotherapy is indicated for treatment of adult patients with advanced non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon 
20 insertion mutations, after failure of platinum-based therapy. 
Definition of advanced NSCLC: Advanced NSCLC means that the cancer is unresectable, and that the 
disease is not amenable to curative treatment approaches.  
Advanced NSCLC is a progressive, deadly disease. In this disease setting, the aim of treatment is to 
prolong progression-free survival and overall-survival, and/or to improve symptoms. 
The most common oncogenic driver mutations in NSCLC are activating mutations in the epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR), and multiple approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs are 
targeted against these molecular aberrations. The present application concerns a subset of patients 
with EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations (Exon 20ins), who constitute approximately 10% of patients 
with activating EGFR mutation, and for whom no targeted drug is currently available.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
NSCLC with EGFR Exon 20ins are typically characterised by primary resistance to currently approved 
EGFR TKI treatments as a result of the insertion mutation sterically preventing effective binding of 
these TKIs. There are currently no approved therapies specifically for the treatment of patients with 
Exon 20ins disease and no specific treatment guidelines are given by the American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO) or the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) for treatment of this 
population. The same regimens as for EGFR-negative patients are therefore used, the current standard 
of care for newly diagnosed patients with EGFR Exon 20ins NSCLC being platinum-based 
chemotherapy.  
However, recent data suggest that certain variants of EGFR Ex20ins mutations may be sensitive to 
EGFR-targeted TKIs (Qin 2020). The American NCCN has therefore recently recommended subtyping of 
EGFR ex20ins tumours. However, as the data on these variants is scarce and the reported response 
rates are 11%-17% (1st to 3rd generation TKIs), an unmet medical need still exists. The present 
application concerns second-line treatment after failure on platinum-based chemotherapy. In this 
setting, single-agent chemotherapy, with response rates around 10-15%, or immunotherapy with 
immune checkpoint inhibitors are frequently used. Data from the pivotal trials of pembrolizumab, 
atezolizumab, and nivolumab, respectively, suggest lower ORRs in the EGFR-mutated subsets 
compared with the overall population (pembrolizumab and nivolumab, no data for atezolizumab), 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 134/144 
 
 
 
favouring the comparator docetaxel, together with an OS HR above 1.0 (atezolizumab and nivolumab), 
or a substantially higher and statistically non-significant OS HR (pembrolizumab.) This implies that 
ORR data from the overall populations in immunotherapy studies may not reflect the expected 
outcome in the current subgroup of patients with EGFR Exon 20ins, and that, rather, the chemotherapy 
ORR may be the most relevant for comparison (see further discussion below, section 3.7.4)  
The combination of ramucirumab and docetaxel has been more recently approved for use in second-
line treatment of NSCLC, with 1.5 months OS advantage and ORR of 23% versus 14% in the docetaxel 
alone arm. Subsequently reported results from the pivotal study in patients with adenocarcinoma 
histology (where EGFR mutations predominantly occur) showed ORR 19% vs. 15% in the docetaxel 
alone arm (Paz-Ares 2017).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study EDI1001 (CHRYSALIS) is a phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), single-arm trial (SAT) in non-
resectable or metastatic NSCLC. The study had a dose escalation Part 1, and a dose expansion Part 2. 
In Part 2, cohorts were defined by the presence of different types of EGFR or MET aberrations. 
Different regimens, as monotherapy and in combination with other drugs were investigated in Study 
EDI1001; the current application only concerns monotherapy. 
The primary efficacy population for the present application consists of 114 patients, pooled from Part 1 
and two cohorts in Part 2, who fulfilled the selection criteria of having a tumour with EGFR Exon 20 
insertion mutation and having received prior platinum therapy, who received amivantamab 
monotherapy at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) identified in Part 1, and who had sufficient 
follow-up time as defined by a common inclusion date. This is an exploratory study with no meaningful 
pre-specification of efficacy hypotheses. The most recent data cut-off (DCO), 30 March 2021, with the 
most recent data set, i.e., the extended primary efficacy population with first dose on or before 04 
June 2020, n= 114, are therefore considered pivotal. The primary endpoint was objective response 
rate (ORR); key secondary endpoints were duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
• 
Primary endpoint: ORR by investigator assessment (INV) was 36.8% (95% CI: 28.0%, 
46.4%). Sensitivity analysis by BICR showed ORR 43.0% (95% CI: 33.7%, 52.6%). 
•  Median DOR by investigator assessment was 12.5 months (95% CI: 6.5, 16.1). Sensitivity 
analysis by BICR showed DOR 10.8 months (95% CI: 6.9, 15.0). The proportion of subjects 
with DoR ≥ 6 months was 64.3% (INV), and 55.1% (BICR) 
• 
• 
Time to response was 1.6 months in a majority of responding subjects. The latest response 
observed occurred before 10 months of treatment. 
Tumour shrinkage and objective responses were observed across Exon 20ins mutation 
subtypes. 
•  Median PFS by investigator assessment was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.6, 8.6), at 71% event-
rate. Sensitivity analysis by BICR showed PFS 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.5, 9.7), at 70% event 
rate.  
•  Median OS for the primary efficacy population was 22.8 months (95% CI: 17.5, not estimable), 
at 35% event rate; and the estimated 12-month survival rate was 73% (95% CI: 63%, 80%).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
• 
The exploratory nature of the study, with major protocol revisions based on study data and 
external data, lack of pre-specification and hypothesis testing, are major sources of uncertainty 
in the interpretation of the results. Inconsistencies between study protocol and SAP for Exon 
20ins were noted, e.g. regarding primary endpoint. These inconsistencies and data-driven 
revisions are considered likely reflecting the phase 1 exploratory type of study rather than any 
major problems with study conduct, however, and do not prompt an inspection.  
• 
• 
• 
There is a risk of upward bias in the efficacy results due to selection of the most promising 
cohort. A number of statistical analyses addressing the stability of the ORR estimate did not 
fully resolve the issue. However, the ORR estimates for investigator and independent review 
assessments, respectively, were consistent across 4 data cut-offs and 3 successively expanded 
efficacy populations, offering sufficient reassurance of the stability of the ORR estimate.  
The single-arm study design hampers contextualisation. Comparison with submitted real-world 
data should be done with caution. Inclusion criteria in clinical trials may select for a population 
with better prognosis than in routine health care, resulting in a non-conservative comparison. 
Time-dependent endpoints do not isolate a drug effect in single arm trials. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety evaluation of amivantamab is based on the 489 patients who had received amivantamab 
monotherapy at the data cut-off 30 March 2021 in Study EGI1001 (denoted the All treated population). 
Of these, 380 received the RP2D dose, and 153 were considered to constitute the target population, 
i.e. having the Exon 20ins, prior chemotherapy and were treated at the RP2D. The median duration of 
treatment was 4.1 months, and the median follow-up was 6.6 months (All-treated population). 
In general, the AE pattern was similar between the three safety populations.   
Dose reductions were made in about 12% of subjects in the All treated population. Overall, there were 
few dose reductions due to other TEAEs than those that could be attributed to EGFR inhibition. 
Dose interruption due to an AE was made in about 30% of subjects in the All treated population and in 
32% of the RP2D population. In 9.5% of patients both dose interruption and dose reduction were 
made. The most common reactions that led to dose interruption included known reactions related to 
EGFR inhibition. Pneumonia was also commonly reported but was in none of the cases considered 
related to amivantamab. 
The overall rate of treatment discontinuation due to an AE was 8% but only in 4.3% of subjects in the 
All treated population, treatment discontinuation was made due to an AE that was considered related 
to amivantamab. These events included mainly IRR and reactions associated with EGFR inhibition such 
as paronychia, dermatitis acneiform, stomatitis. There were single events of toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN), asthenia, myalgia, akathisia, and pneumonitis that led to treatment discontinuation and were 
considered related to amivantamab by the investigator. 
The most commonly reported AE was infusion-related reaction (IRR), which can be expected from 
antibody treatment. IRR occurred in around 2/3 of subjects in all three safety analysis populations. IRR 
of ≥Grade 3 occurred in about 2.5% of subjects. The vast majority of IRR reactions occurred during 
the first infusion. IRR could generally be handled by modification of infusion. Post-infusion medications 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 136/144 
 
 
 
 
to treat IRR were needed for about 10% of the study subjects. IRR was reported as the reason for 
treatment discontinuation in 8 subjects (2.2%). The SmPC adequately describes risk minimisation of 
IRR. 
The safety profile of amivantamab was otherwise consistent with its on-target activity against both 
EGFR and MET pathways. Thus, many of the commonly reported AEs were known reactions at EGFR 
inhibition (e.g. dermatitis acneiform, rash, pruritus, dry skin, stomatitis, paronychia) or at MET 
inhibition (hypoalbuminaemia, peripheral oedema). Other AEs occurring in ≥10% of subjects were GI 
disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation), and general disorders such as pyrexia and 
fatigue. Different eye disorders, also a known ADR from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, was observed 
in 12% of the All treated population with amivantamab. There were 13 cases reported as ILD or 
pneumonitis.  
Laboratory parameters that worsened ≥20% in the target population included albumin decreased and 
ALT/AST increased. There were, however, no confirmed cases of drug-induced liver injury. Glucose 
increased was reported in about 50% of subjects, and creatinine increased in about 44% of subjects. 
Hyperglycaemia was, however, only reported as an adverse event in about 5% of subjects and blood 
creatinine increased in about 1%. In addition, lymphocyte count decreased in 35% of subjects in the 
target population.  
Nearly all patients had adverse events of clinical importance: Rash in 75%, IRRs in 65%, peripheral 
oedema in 22% and interstitial lung disease in 2.7% of patients. Rash included several subgroups of 
which the most common were classified as dermatitis acneiformis, rash and rash maculo-papular. 
Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were reported for 41% of subjects. AEs of Grade ≥3 that were considered 
related to treatment with amivantamab were reported for 16% of subjects in the All treated 
population. The most common of these were diarrhoea and neutropenia, paronychia and dermatitis 
acneiform, and IRR. There were overall 23 fatal events during or within 30 days post amivantamab-
treatment. None of the fatal events were considered related to amivantamab.  
Serious adverse events were reported in 29% of patients in the RP2D group. In 5.5% of patients, SAEs 
were assessed to be related to amivantamab. The most commonly reported SAEs concerned 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, dyspnoea being the most common of these. Infections 
and infestations were reported as SAEs in 7.2% of patients, pneumonia being the most common of 
these. The most commonly reported serious events (≥2 events) considered related to amivantamab 
were IRR, pneumonitis and diarrhoea. 
Available data indicate that no specific recommendations are needed based on age, sex or race.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The single arm study design does not allow for a conclusive causal attribution of the side effect profile 
of amivantamab, but this is considered acceptable in the applied indication. 
There is no data in patients with severe renal impairment or moderate-severe hepatic impairment, and 
caution is therefore advised in such patients. Further, safety data in patients ≥75 years of age is 
limited, which is described in the SmPC. 
The number of subjects with anti-amivantamab antibodies was low (<1%) and their antibody titres 
were low. There was no evidence of an altered PK, efficacy, or safety profile due to anti amivantamab 
antibodies, however data are too limited to draw conclusions on the potential effect of antibodies on 
the PK, efficacy or safety of amivantamab. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 137/144 
 
 
 
for IRRs, infusion modification and treatment of symptoms, and did in relatively few subjects lead to 
treatment discontinuation. There were no deaths that were considered related to amivantamab 
treatment.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy results of ORR around or above 35% together with a substantial DOR around 12 months 
are considered to outweigh the risks in terms of side-effects of the treatment and any remaining 
uncertainties concerning the safety profile. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Pivotal data set 
In the absence of a pre-planned hypothesis testing analysis and analysis population, the most updated 
results in the most extended data set submitted (fulfilling predefined follow-up criteria) are considered 
the most informative and therefore pivotal to the approval. The claims in the SmPC 5.1 are therefore 
based on the 114-population. 
Scope of the indication 
The indication initially claimed by the Applicant was “after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy”. 
All subjects had received prior platinum-based systemic therapy. In addition, 44% of subjects had 
received prior immunotherapy, and 20% had received prior EGFR TKI therapy.  
Subgroup analysis showed activity of amivantamab regardless of prior immunotherapy. 
Among the 50 patients (44% of the 114 subjects in the pivotal efficacy population) who had received 
prior treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, 17 (15% of the pivotal efficacy population) 
received a checkpoint inhibitor as part of a platinum-based chemo-immunotherapy regimen. 
Since prior treatment with chemo-immunotherapy rather than only a platinum doublet alone, is not 
anticipated to impact the activity of Rybrevant, an indication encompassing also patient having 
received a checkpoint inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy is considered appropriate. Thus, 
removing the word “chemo” from the indication is considered justified, to “after failure of platinum-
based therapy”. 
Posology – treatment duration 
Among the 114 patients, data from 25 patients who received continued treatment with amivantamab 
post progression and who had a post-progression disease assessment, showed a duration of post-
progression amivantamab treatment of mean 4.5 months, and median 4.2 months. 16% received 
post-progression therapy for ≥ 6 months. While it may be acknowledged that for selected individual 
cases, in patients who tolerate the treatment well, and depending on the form of PD, continued 
treatment after PD could be a reasonable treatment strategy in the absence of effective next line 
therapies. However, from a B/R perspective, in a situation where there is objective evidence of loss of 
tumour control (i.e. PD by RECIST), the clinical benefit of extended treatment is not considered 
established based on the available data. A positive B/R for such post-progression treatment can 
therefore not be established.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021

Efficacy 
Due to both the single-arm design and the limited size of the pivotal trial, data are not considered 
comprehensive. The Applicant has therefore sought a conditional marketing authorisation. In this 
context, the efficacy and safety in relation to other available therapies are outlined. 
• 
EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase-inhibitors (TKIs): 
EGFR ex20ins mutations induce a steric hindrance of the drug-binding pocket, which prevents binding 
of EGFR TKI. Preclinical models and patient-derived experimental models confirmed that EGFR ex20ins 
in the domain immediately following the C-helix confer poor response to erlotinib, gefitinib and 
afatinib. EGFR ex20ins are on average 100 times less sensitive than the common sensitizing EGFR 
mutations. For this reason, patients harbouring this mutation have generally been excluded from 
pivotal clinical trials, although they are formally included in the indications for Iressa, Tarceva and 
Giotrif. One exception is currently known and noted in the NCCN NSCLC guideline: the Exon 20 ins 
mutation Y764nsFQEA, which is associated with sensitivity to available EGFR TKIs. 
Limited activity of TKIs on EGFR ex20ins has been seen in small clinical series, where in some cases 
also the TKI-sensitive Y764nsFQEA mutation is known to have been included in the activity estimates 
(Remon et al, 2020, Cardona et al, 2018). Consequently Iressa, Tarceva and Giotrif are not 
recommended for the treatment of patients with ex20ins (NCCN guidelines). The activity shown for 
Rybrevant is indicative of a major therapeutic advantage in terms of efficacy, over Iressa, Tarceva and 
Giotrif. 
• 
Immunotherapies: 
Available immunotherapies in second- or third-line NSCLC after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy 
has shown overall objective response rates of 20-21% versus 9% for pembrolizumab versus docetaxel 
(Keytruda SmPC), 14% (13.6%) versus 13% (13.4%) for atezolizumab versus docetaxel (Tecentriq 
SmPC, EPAR NCE), and 19% versus 12% for nivolumab vs docetaxel (Opdivo SmPC). The pivotal 
studies all included small proportions of patients with EGFR-mutated tumours, who were required, or 
allowed, to have received also prior EGFR targeted TKI therapy.  
In Keynote-010, in the approved patient population with TPS ≥1%, a 10% difference in ORR between 
study arms was observed in the overall population favouring pembrolizumab, while in the EGFR-
mutated subset (n=86), the difference in ORR was 25% in favour of docetaxel. The OS HR for 
pembrolizumab versus docetaxel was 0.67 (95% CI: 0,56; 0.80) in the total population, and 0.88 
(95% CI 0.45; 1.70) in the EGFR mutation positive subset. (Keytruda EPAR, variation II-07, Figures 34 
and 40; Herbst 2016. Note: The OS subgroup data presented in Herbst 2016 are the same as those in 
EPAR Figure 34.) 
In the OAK study, the overall OS HR for atezolizumab vs docetaxel was 0.73 (95% CI:0.62: 0.87), 
while the subgroup with EGFR-mutation (n=85) had an OS HR of 1.24 (95% CI: 0.71; 2.18). 
(Tecentriq SmPC; Rittmeyer 2017. Note: The same OS subgroup data presented in Rittmeyer 2017 
were also included in the MAH’s NCE submission but were not published in the NCE EPAR.) 
In Study CA209057, the overall ORR was 19% versus 12% for nivolumab versus docetaxel, as noted 
above. In the EGFR-mutated subset (n=82), however, the ORR was 11% versus 16% for nivolumab 
versus docetaxel. Furthermore, OS HR was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.62- 0.91) in the total population, 
favouring nivolumab, with median OS 12.2 versus 9.4 months. In the EGFR-mutated subset, OS HR 
was 1.18 (95% CI: 0.69- 2.06), with median OS 9.2 versus 11.5 months for nivolumab versus 
docetaxel. (Opdivo EPAR variation II-02, 2016, Table 24. Note: The OS subgroup data presented in 
Borghaei 2015 are the same as those in EPAR.) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 141/144 
 
 
 
Thus, available OS point estimates suggest a possible smaller or no effect (pembrolizumab), or even 
detrimental effect (atezolizumab and nivolumab) of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment compared 
with single-agent docetaxel as second- or third-line treatment of NSCLC with EGFR mutation. In 
addition, while overall ORR favoured the immunotherapy, also ORR favoured docetaxel in patients with 
EGFR mutation for products where subgroup data was available (pembrolizumab, nivolumab).  
Taken together, these data suggest that the overall ORR for these immunotherapies, based on the 
total population, may not reflect expected outcomes in the presently sought indication in patients 
whose tumours have EGFR Exon 20ins mutations. Taking into account also the data for ramucirumab 
plus docetaxel (see above, section 3.1.2). ORR above 20% does not seem likely to be expected from 
currently available treatment options in second-line NSCLC Exon 20ins.  
Safety 
The safety profile of amivantamab is somewhat different from potential alternative treatment options 
for this patient population, such as docetaxel and immune checkpoint inhibitors.  
While both amivantamab and docetaxel are associated with gastrointestinal AEs, such as diarrhoea 
(with approximately similar rates of grade 3-4 diarrhoea) and stomatitis, treatment with docetaxel is 
associated with a higher rate of haematological AEs such as neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia. 
Other very common AEs include infections (grade 3-4 infections reported in about 5% of NSCLC 
patients) and neuropathies. Febrile neutropenia is reported as Common (≥1/100, <1/10) for 
docetaxel. For amivantamab, AEs within SOC Infections and infestations, although commonly reported, 
consisted primarily of paronychia and there were no serious infections that were considered related to 
amivantamab. The most commonly reported AEs for amivantamab were within the grouped term rash, 
where grade 3-4 reactions occurred in 3% of the safety population. There was one case of TEN, which 
led to treatment discontinuation. However, skin and nail reactions have been reported as Very 
Common also for docetaxel, with grade 3-4 skin reactions in about 6% of NSCLC patients.  
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported for docetaxel, mainly at the first infusion, but at a lower 
rate than for amivantamab. For both treatments, most of the IRR/hypersensitivity reactions occurred 
during the first infusion.  
IRR, haematological and gastrointestinal reactions are reported also for immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
In contrast to amivantamab and docetaxel, the most serious AEs with immune checkpoint inhibitors 
are the immune-related AEs, which include e.g. pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, nephritis, 
endocrinopathies and skin reactions (including Steven-Johnsons syndrome and TEN). 
The recently approved combination of ramucirumab and docetaxel was, compared with docetaxel 
only, associated with higher rates of stomatitis, bleeding or haemorrhage and hypertension.  
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission.  
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations as it aims at the treatment of a seriously debilitating and life-
threatening disease.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/629045/2021 
Page 142/144 
 
 
 
As specific obligation (SOB), the Applicant will provide confirmatory efficacy and safety data from 
the ongoing study 61186372NSC3001, which is a randomized, open-label phase 3 study 
comparing amivantamab in combination with carboplatin-pemetrexed therapy versus carboplatin-
pemetrexed, in advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with activating EGFR Exon 20 insertion 
mutations in the first-line setting. This study will provide data on the add-on activity and efficacy 
of amivantamab in an earlier line of treatment. If positive, this could be considered to support the 
implication of observed ORR on time-to-event outcomes, while not formally “confirming” the ORR 
results from the present study. Safety data for combination with chemotherapy will furthermore 
be received. The randomised design will allow isolation of drug effects (ADRs) from symptoms of 
disease, which will add to the current safety information based on SAT data. Given the activity 
and tolerability demonstrated for Rybrevant to date, the proposed SOB in an earlier setting is 
considered acceptable.  
The Applicant is recommended to submit results from any future data cut-offs from the pivotal 
Study EDI1001. Considering the maturity of the data submitted from study EDI1001, further 
analysis are not expected to contribute to the comprehensiveness of the data for Rybrevant. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as patients with NSCLC with EGFR Exon 20ins who have 
progressed on platinum-based therapy have few available treatment options and currently 
available therapies have limited efficacy. 
There is a major therapeutic advantage over existing therapies. As outlined above, amivantamab 
is anticipated to be at least equally effective as existing treatment alternatives, while providing a 
major therapeutic advantage in the form of a differential safety profile compared to chemotherapy 
as well as immune therapy. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. Given the positive benefit/risk and the unmet medical need 
in the applied indications as described above, this is considered fulfilled. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of RYBREVANT is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations

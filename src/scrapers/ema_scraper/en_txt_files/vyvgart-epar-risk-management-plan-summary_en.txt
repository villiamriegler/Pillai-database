PART VI  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR VYVGART 
(EFGARTIGIMOD) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Vyvgart. The RMP details 
important risks of Vyvgart, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Vyvgart risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Vyvgart’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Vyvgart should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Vyvgart should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Vyvgart’s RMP.  
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
I 
Vyvgart is used together with standard therapy to treat adults with generalized myasthenia 
gravis (gMG), an autoimmune disease that causes muscle weakness. It contains efgartigimod 
alfa as the active substance and it is given by intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection 
(see SmPC). 
Further information about the evaluation of Vyvgart benefits can be found in Vyvgart EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vyvgart.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE 
THE RISKS 
Important risks of Vyvgart, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Vyvgart’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
• 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
• 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with 
• 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update reports (PSUR) assessments so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vyvgart is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing information” below.  
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
II.A 
Important risks of Vyvgart are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Vyvgart. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important Potential Risk: Serious Infections 
Summary of Important Risks 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
No evidence for an increased risk of serious infections (defined as any 
infection meeting the seriousness criteria for an individual case safety 
report) with the use of efgartigimod was seen in the clinical 
development program. The majority of infections observed in patients 
treated with efgartigimod were mild or moderate, and transient. The 
type and severity of infections observed in patients treated with 
efgartigimod was comparable to that observed in patients receiving 
placebo and their frequency did not increase with repeated cycles of 
treatment. None of the patients who received efgartigimod treatment 
had opportunistic infections. 
Vyvgart (efgartigimod) binds to a specific protein in the body, called 
neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn). Efgartigimod binds to and blocks FcRn, 
which results in a transient lowering of a type of antibody called 
immunoglobulin G (IgG). In patients testing positive for acetylcholine 
receptor (AChR) antibodies, the maximum mean percentage decrease in 
total IgG levels compared to baseline reached 61% 1 week after the last 
infusion of the initial treatment cycle and returned to baseline levels 9 
 
weeks after the last infusion. For efgartigimod SC, total IgG and 
AChR-Ab reduction followed a similar time course to that seen with IV. 
Similar effects were also observed for all subtypes of IgG. This 
lowering of IgG levels could increase the risk of infections.  
The observed reductions in total antibodies were specific to IgG as no 
relevant decrease in all the other types of antibodies (IgA, IgD, IgE, 
IgM) nor albumin levels were observed. Additionally, due to the mode 
of action of efgartigimod of blocking FcRn, no impact on IgG 
production is expected.  
Given the potential mechanism of action of Vyvgart, serious infections 
are considered an important potential risk.  
Underlying immunodeficiency conditions, either acquired or due to 
immunosuppressive drugs, represent a general risk factor for serious 
infections. The risk increases with more pronounced impairment of the 
immune system.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
During the clinical development program, an imbalance was seen 
between neoplasms in patients treated with efgartigimod and patients 
receiving placebo, with 11 events of neoplasms observed in 8 patients 
treated with efgartigimod IV (1 in study ARGX-113-1704 and 10 in 7 
patients in study ARGX‑113‑1705) and only 1 event observed in the 
placebo group. In patients treated with efgartigimod SC, 2 events of 
neoplasms were observed in 2 patients in study ARGX-113-2002 (none 
were observed in study ARGX-113-2001). All malignant neoplasms 
were assessed as not related to efgartigimod by the investigator. 
Available data on other IgG-reducing agents or treatments do not 
suggest a correlation between IgG reduction and an increased risk of 
developing any type of cancer. No literature could be found associating 
chronic use of plasma exchange, immunoadsorption, and 
plasmapheresis therapies reducing IgGs with the development of 
malignancies. Immunosuppressants, which patients with MG take 
concomitantly with efgartigimod, can impair the immune response to 
cancer. Therefore, malignancies are considered an important potential 
risk. 
Risk factors for malignancy include traditional risk factors such as 
advancing age, smoking, drinking alcohol, obesity, sun exposure, 
radiation and chemicals exposure, hormonal disturbance, and family 
history.

Studies Which Are Conditions of the Marketing Authorization 
There are no studies which are conditions of the marketing authorization or specific 
obligations of Vyvgart.  
II.C.2 
Other Studies in Post-Authorization Development Plan 
ARGX-113-1705 - A long-term, single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 follow-on study 
of ARGX-113-1704 to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ARGX-113 in patients with 
myasthenia gravis having generalized muscle weakness. 
Purpose of the study: to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of efgartigimod IV 
administered to patients with gMG. This extension study was designed to collect additional 
safety data to supplement that from the randomized placebo-controlled study ARGX-113-
1704 and to offer efgartigimod treatment for patients who were randomized to receive 
placebo in the study ARGX-113-1704.  
Post-authorization Safety Study 
Purpose of the study: to investigate the safety profile of efgartigimod in a larger patient 
population for a longer duration than in clinical studies and under conditions of normal 
clinical practice. The focus is to further characterize potential risks and areas of missing 
information. In addition, given that long-term safety data is limited, the post-authorization 
safety study will evaluate whether there are specific and/or unexpected patterns of adverse 
events.  
Post-Authorization Pregnancy Safety Study 
Purpose of the study: There are no studies of efgartigimod exposure in pregnant women. 
Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded from the clinical studies. The safety of 
efgartigimod in pregnant and breastfeeding women is unknown. 
This pregnancy safety study will assess maternal, fetal, and infant outcomes following 
exposure to efgartigimod during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding.

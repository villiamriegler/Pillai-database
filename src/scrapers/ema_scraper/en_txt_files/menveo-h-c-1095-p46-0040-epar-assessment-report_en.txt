1.  Introduction 
On 21 December 2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Menveo in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Menveo is indicated for active immunization of children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults 
at risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
Menveo should be administered as a single dose (0.5 ml). To ensure optimal antibody levels against all 
vaccine  serogroups,  the  primary  vaccination  schedule  with  Menveo  should  be  completed  one  month 
prior to risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitides groups A, C, W135 and Y. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that A Phase IV, Open-Label, Multi-Center Study to Evaluate the Safety and the 1-year 
Persistence of Antibody Response Among Children Who Received 4 Doses of the GSK MenACWY 
Conjugate Vaccine at 2, 4, 6 and 12 Months of Age in South Korea, study V59_75, is a stand alone 
study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The study vaccine specific to this study was the MenACWY-CRM vaccine (Menveo, GSK Biologicals). 
There is no specific paediatric formulation. The meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine was to be 
reconstituted just before injection of the lyophilized MenA-CRM component with the MenCWY-CRM full 
liquid vaccine. The pharmaceutical form was a powder and solution for injection. Menveo was provided 
as vial/vial presentation. MenA lyophilised conjugate component (glass vial) and MenCWY liquid 
conjugate component (glass vial).  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

V59_75: A Phase IV, Open-Label, Multi-Center Study to Evaluate the Safety 
and the 1-year Persistence of Antibody Response Among Children Who 
Received 4 Doses of the GSK MenACWY Conjugate Vaccine at 2, 4, 6 and 12 
Months of Age in South Korea 
Description 
This is a Phase IV multicenter open label, post marketing study to evaluate the persistence of antibody 
response in approximately 135 children 1 year after completion of series of Menveo vaccination at 2-4-
6-12 month vaccination. 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary Immunogenicity Objective: 
•  To evaluate the persistence of the antibody response against Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, 
C, W and Y at approximately 1 year after completion of a 4 dose infant vaccination series (2, 4, 6 
and 12 months of age) of Meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) vaccine as measured by human 
complement Serum Bactericidal Assay (hSBA) ≥ 8. 
•  To evaluate the persistence of the antibody response against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W 
and Y at approximately 1 year after completion of a 4 dose infant vaccination series (2, 4, 6 and 12 
months of age) of MenACWY vaccine as measured by rabbit complement Serum Bactericidal Assay 
(rSBA) ≥ 8 and ≥ 128. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives: 
•  To describe hSBA ≥ 8 and hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) against N meningitidis serogroups A, 
C, W and Y 1 month after a full vaccination series at 2,4,6 and 12 months of age. 
•  To describe rSBA ≥ 8 and ≥ 128 and rSBA GMTs against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y 1 
month after a full vaccination series at 2,4,6 and 12 months of age.  
•  To evaluate the persistence of the antibody response against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W 
and Y at approximately 1 year after completion of a 4 dose infant vaccination series (2, 4, 6 and 12 
months of age) of MenACWY vaccine as measured by hSBA GMTs and rSBA GMTs. 
Primary Safety Objectives: 
•  To assess the safety and tolerability of MenACWY administered at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age. 
Study design 
This is a Phase IV multicenter open label, post marketing study to evaluate the persistence of antibody 
response in approximately 135 children 1 year after completion of series of Menveo vaccination at 2-4-
6-12 month vaccination. All participants will receive 4 doses of Menveo in an open label fashion. A total 
of two blood samples will be drawn from all subjects for immunogenicity evaluation at the following 
time points: 1 month after the fourth and last dose of Menveo vaccine, (Visit 5, 13 months of age) and 
one during the last clinical visit (Visit 6, 24 months of age). Safety data will be solicited for 7 days 
through a subject diary.

Study population /Sample size 
The study included healthy male and female infants aged between 55 and 89 days on the day of 
consent. Exclusion criteria common to vaccine studies applied, in addition subjects were not to have 
previously received MenACWY vaccine, previously had confirmed or suspected N meningitidis, or close 
contact with a case, or have any underlying (unstable, uncontrolled) clinical condition, 
immunosuppression, acute or chronic infection. 
Assessor’s comments 
This study is in healthy infants of around 2 months of age, and therefore falls outside the current 
indication for Menveo.  
Treatments 
Subjects received Menveo at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months. No reference (control) vaccine was used in this 
study.

Assessor’s comments 
The immunogenicity endpoints do not take into account potential baseline immunogenicity, however 
considering the age of the study population natural exposure would be very low therefore this is 
acceptable. 
Statistical Methods 
There was no statistical hypothesis associated with the immunogenicity objective. All analyses were to 
be run descriptively. 
Persistence was to be summarized as the percentage of subjects with a titer ≥ 8 (hSBA) or with a titer 
≥ 8 and ≥ 128 (rSBA) along with associated 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals (CIs). 
The antibody titers were to be summarized using GMTs with 2-sided 95% CIs constructed by 
exponentiation (base 10) of the means and confidence limits of the logarithmically transformed (base 
10) antibody titer. Moreover, the geometric mean ratios (GMR) between visit 6 (1 year after full 
vaccination) and visit 5 (1 month after full vaccination) were to be provided along with the 2-sided 
95% CIs. 
Approximately 135 subjects were to be enrolled in this study providing approximately 100 evaluable 
subjects, assuming a 25% drop-out. The sample size was based on the number of subjects requested 
and agreed with South Korean Health Authorities for this persistence study. 
With 100 evaluable subjects, the 95% confidence limits of the observed percentages of subjects with 
hSBA ≥ 8 or rSBA ≥ 8 or ≥ 128 were to be as presented in the following table:

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
This study was conducted at six study centres in South Korea. The first subject was enrolled on 13 July 
2015, the last visit completed on 28 December 2017. 
In total, 128 subjects were enrolled and all (100%) received the MenACWY vaccine. A total of 117 
(91%) subjects completed the study. Reason for premature withdrawal of 11 subjects were: lost to 
follow-up (8), withdrawal by the subject (2), and protocol deviation/ violation (1). 
For the primary objective, up to 114 (89%) subjects were included in hSBA FAS and up to 108 (84%) 
subjects were included in rSBA FAS. For the secondary objective, up to 122 (95%) subjects were 
included in hSBA FAS and up to 116 (91%) subjects were included in rSBA FAS. The main reason for 
exclusion from various analysis sets was, serological results not available post-vaccination.

Study conduct 
Out of total 128 enrolled subjects, 42 (33%) subjects had protocol deviations. Main reason for protocol 
deviations was key study procedures missed or performed out of time window (30%) that included 
subject not complying with study vaccination schedule (18%) or blood draw schedule (5%) and 
serological results not available post-vaccination (11%). 
Baseline data 
The mean age of subjects at enrolment was 71.7 days, mean height was 59.5 cm, and mean body 
weight was 6.1 kg. 54% subjects were males and 46% subjects were females. All subjects, except for 
1 subject (‘Other’), were of ‘Asian’ race. 
Efficacy results 
Primary immunogenicity objective: persistence with hSBA ≥8 and rSBA titers ≥ 8 and ≥ 128 
One year after the 4-dose infant vaccination series, the percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 8 
ranged between 39% (MenA) and 89% (MenY). 
One year after completion of the 4-dose infant vaccination series, the percentage of subjects with rSBA 
titers ≥ 8 ranged between 54% (MenC) and 99% (MenA). 
When using 128 as cut-off titer, the percentages of subjects with rSBA titers ≥ 128, one year after 
completion the 4-dose infant vaccination series, ranged between 30% (MenC) and 98% (MenA).

Assessor’s comments 
There is poor correlation between the rSBA and hSBA response, which is also seen in other studies. 
Poor persistence is seen for MenA when considering the hSBA but not when considering the rSBA. For 
the rSBA, persistence seems to be poor for MenC; this is not seen with the hSBA. 
Secondary Objectives 
 hSBA and rSBA one month after vaccination 
One month after completion of the 4-dose infant MenACWY vaccination series the percentage of 
subjects with hSBA titer ≥ 8 ranged between 94% (MenA,) and 100% (MenW and MenY) and the hSBA 
GMTs ranged between 107.90 (MenA) and 426.74 (MenW). 
One month after completion of the 4-dose infant MenACWY vaccination series, almost all subjects had 
rSBA titer ≥ 8 and the percentage of subjects with rSBA titer ≥ 128 raged between 92% (Men C) and 
100% (MenA). The rSBA GMTs ranged between 735.07 (Men C) and 7394.18 (Men A). 
Antibody persistence as hSBA GMTs and rSBA GMTs. 
One year after completion of the 4-dose MenACWY vaccination series hSBA GMTs ranged between 6.80 
(MenA) and 53.56 (MenW), while rSBA GMTs ranged between 17.17 (MenC) and 2269.48 (MenA).

Exposure 
Adverse Events 
Solicited AEs: 
Overall, the percentage of subjects with any solicited AEs reported was 66% after the first vaccination, 
51% after the second vaccination, 46% after the third vaccination, and 52% after the fourth 
vaccination. 
•  The most common solicited local AE was tenderness, reported in 13%, 16%, 11%, 16% subjects 
after each of the 4 vaccinations, with severe tenderness reported in 0%-2% subjects across 
vaccinations. 
• 
Irritability (45%, 38%, 37%, 36% after each of the 4 vaccinations) and sleepiness (41%, 24%, 
22%, 16% after each of the 4 vaccinations) were the most common solicited systemic AEs 
reported, with severe irritability in 2%-4% subjects and severe sleepiness in 0%-3% subjects. 
•  Most of the reported solicited local and systemic AEs were mild to moderate in intensity with onset 
from 6 hours to day 3 after vaccination and most of them resolved within 7 days.

Unsolicited AEs (medically attended): 
A total of 66% subjects experienced an unsolicited AE, with 1 subject having at least possibly related 
AE (diarrhoea).  
The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs were classified under the MedDRA SOC of ‘infections and 
infestations’ (59%). The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs, by Preferred Term, were: upper 
respiratory tract infection (27%), bronchiolitis (12%), and nasopharyngitis (12%). Most of the 
unsolicited AEs were mild to moderate in intensity, and most of them resolved before study 
termination.

Twenty-six (20%) subjects were reported with SAEs and none of them that was considered by the 
investigator as related to the study vaccine. The most common MedDRA SOC reported for SAEs was 
‘infections and infestations’ in 22 (17%) subjects.  
No subject had unsolicited AEs leading to premature withdrawal. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This phase 4 uncontrolled open label study was designed to meet a regulatory requirement 
surrounding the licensure of Menveo in infants from 2 months of age in South Korean. The study 
population is not included in the indication of Menveo as licensed in Europe. 
In total, 128 infants with a mean age of 71.7 days were enrolled and received Menveo according to a 
2,4,6 and 12 months schedule. The primary objective was to describe the persistence of antibodies as 
measured by hSBA and rSBA one year after completing the vaccination schedule, and to determine the 
reactogenicity and safety of Menveo in this population.  
At one year from schedule completion, percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 8 were 39% against 
MenA, 61% against MenC, 88% against MenW and 89% against MenY serogroups, respectively. When 
analyzed using a rSBA, at one year following completion of the vaccination series, the percentages of 
subjects with titers ≥ 8 were 99% against MenA, 54% against Men C, 69% against MenW and 90% 
against Men Y. 
The 4-dose MenACWY infant schedule was well tolerated in the study population. Most of the AEs were 
mild to moderate in intensity, and resolved within study termination. One subject had an unsolicited 
AEs possibly/probably related to vaccination. 
The MAH concludes that the 4-dose vaccination series with MenACWY was able to induce robust 
immune responses after completion of the schedule, with good persistence of immunogenicity at 1 
year. No new clinical concerns were raised with respect to the safety data available in this study. 
Due to the absence of an appropriate control in this study, results need to be interpret cautiously and 
the conclusion of the MAH is therefore not completely supported as no inference should be made 
concerning the value of the responses seen.  
It can be concluded that the study does not give rise to any concern and has no consequences for the 
licensing of Menveo in Europe, mostly as the vaccine is not licensed for infants in Europe and as little 
inference can be made based upon the present study. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The submitted study does not influence the benefit-risk balance of Menveo. No further regulatory 
action is required. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

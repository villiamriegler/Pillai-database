1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Baxalta Innovations GmbH 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 31 March 2022 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Update of section 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update safety data in paediatric population 
based on final results from study 161504 – Post-Authorization Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity 
Evaluation of HyQvia in Pediatric Subjects With Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases, listed as a 
category 3 study in the RMP. This is a paediatric interventional Phase 4 study performed to acquire 
additional data on safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of HyQvia in pediatric (age two to <18 
years) patients with Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PIDD). 
In addition, the MAH is taking this opportunity to update Annex II-D of the PI following procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002491/II/0070/G. 
The RMP version 13.1 has also been submitted. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and 
Annex II and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The MAH submitted the results of the PASS 161504 (category 3 study), which collected additional data 
on safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of HyQvia in paediatric (age 2 to <18 years) subjects with 
PIDD. Resulting from this data, the RMP has been updated. 
Information on the PASS have been included in the RMP and the study has been removed from the 
pharmacovigilance plan and from additional pharmacovigilance activities. In addition, amendments to 
the RMP and the SmPC were proposed based on the previous variation II/70: the MAH provides 
detailed information on educational material for healthcare professionals and patients and includes a 
dairy for patients. The amendments of the RMP (version 13.1) and of Annex II-D of the SmPC are 
accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, HyQvia is removed from the 
additional monitoring list as the PASS 161302 is fulfilled. Therefore, the statement that this medicinal 
product is subject to additional monitoring is removed from the SmPC and Package leaflet. The main 
results of the PASS 161504 are described below: 
The Phase 4, non-controlled, multicenter study 161504 provides additional data on safety, tolerability, 
and immunogenicity of HyQvia in paediatric subjects (age 2 to <18 years), who had received prior 
immunoglobulin therapy. Both HyQvia pre-treated and HyQvia new starters were enrolled in the study. 
For HyQvia new starters, intervals and doses in Epoch 1 were gradually increased in a ramp-up phase 
to an interval of 3 or 4 weeks (same interval that they had been treated IV before the study, or the 
interval selected at the investigator’s discretion if pre-study treatment was SCIG). The HyQvia pre-
treated subjects started directly into the Epoch 2 of the study and did not complete the Epoch 1 ramp-
up. 
Overall, the rate of reported AEs is low and reflects the expected, identified adverse reactions for 
Assessment report

HyQvia. Two (2) severe TEAEs related to HyQvia treatment were reported (infusion site pain and 
emotional distress), both in the same subject, who discontinued the Epoch 2 of the study due to 
emotional distress. 
Neutralizing antibodies were not assessed as no subject developed anti-rHuPH20 antibodies with a titer 
≥160. The current study is in line with the findings of the PASS 161302 that confirmed rHuPH20-
reactive binding antibodies to be rare and which did not detect any neutralizing antibodies in the 
subjects. 
Stable and sufficiently protective IgG levels determined throughout the study and a low rate of ASBI 
occurrences among the paediatric subjects with PIDD (0.019 per subject-year) underline the efficacy of 
HyQvia treatment.  
No new safety concerns were identified following HyQvia treatment in paediatric subjects with PIDD 
who had received immunoglobulin therapy prior to study enrolment. A summary of the safety data and 
a summary of the study have been included in section 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, respectively. 
The CHMP concluded that the benefit-risk balance of HyQvia remains positive.

Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) results: Study 161504 “Post-Authorisation Safety, Tolerability 
and Immunogenicity Evaluation of HyQvia in Pediatric Subjects with Primary Immunodeficiency 
Diseases”. 
7.1.  Milestones 
In the final study report, a table with milestones was not included. The Last Patient Out of the Study 
was on 15 January 2021 and therefore, considering that this is a pediatric study, the CSR should have 
been submitted 6 months afterwards. This delay was explained by the MAH with the challenges during 
the coronavirus pandemic. According to the last protocol amendment in 04 December 2019, the 
planned study period was as follows: 
The first patient was enrolled in May 2017. In earlier amendments of the protocol (October and March 
2016), the primary and study completion dates were dated for 2021. 
CHMP comment: 
The PASS was finished earlier than stated in the last study protocol amendment, but as originally 
planned in the beginning of the study. As no subject reported an anti-rHuPH20 antibody titer of ≥160 
at any timepoint during the study, the actual study participation duration was shorter for all subjects 
since no subject proceeded into Epoch 3 of the study due to the titer. One subject did go into Epoch 3. 
The delay in the submission of the final study report after the last patient finished the study is 
acceptable due to the coronavirus pandemic.

7.2.  Rationale and background 
The rationale for the current HyQvia post-authorization (161504) study, was to collect additional data 
on safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of HyQvia in pediatric (age 2 to <18 years) subjects with 
PIDD. 
The MAH describes the usage of immunoglobulins (IG) as replacement therapy (0.3 to 0.6 g/kg body 
weight (BW) every 3 to 4 weeks) in primary immunodeficiencies (PIDD) to prevent or reduce severe 
infections. 
HyQvia is a human immunoglobulin (mainly IgG) with rHuPH20 that is applied subcutaneously. It is 
manufactured from pooled human plasma from minimum 1,000 donations and reflects the IgG variety 
of the average population. The IGI 10% (Human) also contains a spectrum of antibodies capable of 
interacting with and altering the activity of cells of the immune system as well as antibodies capable of 
reacting with cells such as erythrocytes. The role of these antibodies and the mechanisms of action of 
IgG in the IGI 10% (Human) of HyQvia have not been fully elucidated. 
HyQvia is licensed for the treatment of PIDD in adults in the US (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, 2014) 
and among adults and children in the EU (Baxalta Innovations GmbH, 2018). It is approved as a 
replacement therapy in adults, children and adolescents (0 to 18 years) in primary immunodeficiency 
syndromes with impaired antibody production and for secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) in patients 
who suffer from severe or recurrent infections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven 
specific antibody failure (PSAF), or serum IgG level of <4 g/L. HyQvia is also indicated for treatment of 
but, not limited to, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), X-linked agammaglobulinemia, 
congenital agammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and severe combined immunodeficiencies. 
7.3.  Research question and objectives 
Study Purpose 
The purpose of the study was to acquire additional data on safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 
HyQvia in pediatric (age two to <18 years) subjects with Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PIDD). 
The study did not employ placebo or active controls. 
Objectives: 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety of HyQvia treatment in pediatric subjects 
with primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) who had received immunoglobulin therapy prior to 
study enrolment. 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of the study were further safety assessments (e.g. immunogenicity), 
tolerability, characteristics of product administration and efficacy (IgG trough levels). 
Tertiary Objectives 
The tertiary objectives were further safety and efficacy assessments. 
Assessment report  
EMA/ 885669/2022

7.4.  Amendments and updates to the protocol 
The MAH states that the original protocol dated 16 Mar 2016 was amended twice. The amendments of 
the study protocol did not have an impact on the validity of study results as initially planned in the first 
endorsed study protocol. 
Besides others, the most relevant amendments were to clarify the reporting requirement for SUSARs 
and to match the requirements of the latest revision of the sponsor’s protocol template and update the 
study inclusion criteria. Most amendments were editorial changes. 
Impact of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency on the Conduct of the Study 
Study enrolment was completed before COVID-19 started, and therefore was not impacted. When the 
COVID-19 public health emergency started in March 2020, the scheduled visits of a total of 3 subjects 
were delayed (Epoch 2 Month 6, n=2 and Epoch 2 Month 12, n=1). The Epoch 2 Month 12 visits for 
the  
2 subjects were conducted at a delayed date; however, the Epoch 2 Month 6 visit could not be 
arranged for the third subject prior to the next scheduled visit (Epoch 2 Month 9) due to the prolonged 
COVID-19 restrictions. Hence, the subject was treated at home between Epoch 2 Month 3 and 
Month 9. 
With regards to the adjustments or mitigations of study visits or study procedures, the sponsor 
implemented contingency measures as appropriate to manage study conduct during disruption of the 
study as a result of COVID-19 control measures. Hence, there was no substantial impact of COVID-19 
on the study. 
A total of 3 protocol deviations (all minor) were considered related to COVID-19 pandemic situation. 
These 3 protocol deviations occurred in 3 subjects at 2 out of the 16 sites participating in the study. 
Subjects were unable to attend scheduled visits. However, no impact on key safety assessments were 
reported as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. 
Changes in the Planned Analyses 
•  Given the primary objective of the study was to acquire additional data on safety of HyQvia 
treatment in pediatric subjects with PIDD who have received prior immunoglobulin therapy 
before enrolment into the study, the Per-Protocol Set was not used in this study. Therefore, 
the Per-Protocol Set definition was not provided in the SAP, neither was it considered for any 
data analysis. 
•  Clarification on the protocol endpoint “Number of infusion sites (needle sticks) per 
infusion/month” was made in the final SAP document (dated 25 May 2021). This endpoint was 
equivalent to “Number of infusion sites (needle sticks) per infusion” and “Number of infusion 
sites (needle sticks) per month”. 
•  Additional endpoints and outcome measures for analysis were added for a more complete and 
robust analysis and for alignment with Study 161503, where applicable. 
CHMP comment: 
The changes in section “9.8.1 Changes in the Conduct of the Study” of the study protocol did not have 
an impact on the validity of study results as initially planned in the first endorsed study protocol.

7.5.  Research methods 
Study design 
This was a Phase 4, post-authorization, prospective, non-controlled, multicenter study conducted in  
16 study centers in the European Economic Area. The study comprised of 3 treatment periods: Epoch 
1, Epoch 2, and a 1-year safety follow-up (Epoch 3), if needed. Pediatric subjects between 2 and <18 
years at screening, who had a documented diagnosis of PIDD, had been receiving immunoglobulin 
therapy prior to study enrolment, and had parent or legally authorized representative’s informed 
consent (and where applicable minor subject’s assent), were to be assessed at baseline. 
All subjects were tested regularly for binding anti-recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) 
antibodies approximately every 3 months throughout the study. Testing for anti-rHuPH20 neutralizing 
antibodies was performed for subjects with an anti-rHuPH20 binding antibody titer ≥160. 
Approximately 40 pediatric subjects already on IgG treatment prior to study were planned to be 
enrolled from around 20 study sites in the European Economic Area. Finally, 42 subjects were enrolled 
and analysed for the efficacy and safety of HyQvia (see section study size). 
Initially, the overall duration of the study was expected to be approximately 6 years from study 
initiation (i.e., first subject enrolled) to study completion (i.e., last subject last visit). The recruitment 
period was expected to be approximately 2 years. The maximum subject participation period was 
estimated to be approximately 4 years from enrolment to subject completion (participation in Epoch 1, 
Epoch 2, and Epoch 3). However, as no subject reported the anti-rHuPH20 antibody titer of ≥160 at 
any timepoint during the study, the actual study participation duration was shorter for all subjects.

Figure 1 Study design for Baxalta study 161504. 
Epoch 1 (Treatment with HyQvia, Ramp-up for up to 6 weeks for HyQvia-naïve 
subjects): 
Subjects with PIDD on non-HyQvia IV or SC treatment with immunoglobulin (IV-pre-treated, SC pre-
treated) at the time of enrolment were treated with HyQvia SC with a dose or interval ramp-up period 
of up to 6 weeks, with all infusions administered at the study site. 
Subjects already treated with HyQvia at the time of enrolment were enrolled directly into Epoch 2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/ 885669/2022 
Page 11/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Epoch 2 (Treatment with HyQvia, final dosing for up to 3 years for all subjects): 
The ramp-up (Epoch 1) was followed by Epoch 2 with HyQvia treatment at the following intervals: 
• 
• 
For IV-pre-treated subjects - every 3 or 4 weeks, depending on the subject’s previous IV 
dosing schedule. 
For SC-pre-treated subjects - every 3 or 4 weeks, at the discretion of investigator and subject. 
For HyQvia pre-treated subjects, there was no change in frequency of administration. An alternative 
treatment interval, for example infusion every 2 weeks, was also considered for tolerability reasons at 
the discretion of the investigator, after informing the sponsor. 
After 1 year in Epoch 2, the anti-rHuPH20 binding antibody assay results during that year were used to 
decide the next steps in the study: 
•  Subjects with anti-rHuPH20 antibody titer <160 at all timepoints during the study, performed 
the study completion visit at the next possible occasion. 
•  Subjects with anti-rHuPH20 antibody titer ≥160 during the study and/or at the last 
measurement were to continue in Epoch 2 for an additional 2 years of HyQvia treatment and 
observation. 
In Epoch 2, the first 2 or 3 infusions had to be administered at the study site. Subsequent infusions 
were preferably to be performed at home (or equivalent site) by the subject or caregiver, following 
training by the investigator/designee if in the opinion of the investigator, such treatment was safe and 
appropriate. 
Epoch 3 (Treatment with KIOVIG or Cuvitru; safety follow-up for up to 1 year): 
Epoch 3 was approximately a 1-year safety follow-up, which was to be conducted if needed. Subjects 
with anti-rHuPH20 antibody titer ≥160 during Epoch 1 or Epoch 2 and who experienced either a related 
serious adverse event (SAE) or a related severe adverse event (AE) were followed accordingly. 
In case that a subject in Epoch 1 or in Epoch 2 experienced a related SAE or severe AE without anti-
rHuPH20 antibody titer ≥160, the subject was to be (at the discretion of the investigator and subject) 
(i) terminated from the study; or (ii) switched directly to Epoch 3; or (iii) continued in Epoch 1 or 2 
with appropriate medical intervention such as decreasing the HyQvia infusion rate and/or 
premedication. 
In Epoch 3, the subjects were treated with KIOVIG intravenously (IGIV 10%) or Cuvitru 
subcutaneously (IGSC 20%), at the discretion of the investigator and the subject. Infusions were 
administered at home or at the study site. Subjects with antibody titer of ≥160 entering Epoch 3 were 
to continue regular anti-rHuPH20 antibody testing (approximately every 3 months) for approximately 1 
year. 
CHMP comment: 
Notably, in Epoch 3 of the study, treatment with KIOVIG or Cuvitru, but not with HyQvia, was planned. 
Epoch 3 was thought as a safety follow-up phase of the study. One subject from the HyQvia new 
starter group discontinued Epoch 2 and entered Epoch 3 due to a severe related TEAE of emotional 
distress. HyQvia treatment was withdrawn. An anti-rHuPH20 antibody titer ≥160 was detected in none 
of the patients.

Interim analysis 
A prospectively planned interim analysis of data (cut-off date: 14 May 2020) was performed when 
75% of all subjects enrolled in this study completed 12 months of participation (1-year observation 
period) in Epoch 2. The purpose of the analysis was to update the scientific community, on the interim 
safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of HyQvia in pediatric subjects with PIDD. Only subjects 
enrolled in Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 were considered for this analysis. No change to the design, conduct or 
final analysis of the study occurred due to the interim analysis.

Cuvitru (IGSC 20%) (Epoch 3): 
If needed, subjects were to be treated with Cuvitru subcutaneously daily to once every 2 weeks at the 
investigator´s discretion, during Study Epoch 3 (Safety Follow-up). Administration was to be 
performed by SC route. The weekly dose was to be equivalent to 100% (±5%) of the dose in the 
previous study Epoch. The infusion rate and infusion volume per site were to follow the suggestions of 
the Cuvitru Summary of Product Characteristics, which is available in the countries where Cuvitru is 
registered. In countries where Cuvitru is not registered, an Investigator’s Brochure was made available 
for the purpose of this study. 
Duration of Treatment: 
The recruitment period was expected to be approximately 2 years. The maximum subject participation 
period was estimated to be approximately 4 years from enrolment to subject completion (participation 
in Epoch 1, Epoch 2, and Epoch 3). Of note, the actual study participation duration was shorter for all 
subjects because no subject was reported with anti-rHuPH20 antibody titer of ≥160 at any timepoint 
during the study. 
Subjects 
Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion: 
Each subject had to meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for the study:

CHMP comment: 
The MAH adequately describes the design of the study, the drug treatment scheme administered 
throughout the study and exclusion and inclusion criteria for the subjects that were enrolled. There 
were no significant changes compared to the final approved study protocol. 
Variables 
According  to  the  MAH,  efficacy  measurements  were  performed  by  measuring  trough  levels  of  IgG, 
analysis  of  questionnaires  concerning  treatment  preference,  treatment  satisfaction  for  medication, 
HRQoL. Moreover, data on safety was collected (adverse events).  
The  subject’s  medical  history,  medication  and  non-drug  therapy  was  documented  and  physical 
examinations were conducted. Vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, urine, pregnancy, 
viral pathogens) including anti-rHuPH20 antibodies were determined regularly (approximately every  
3 months). 
For this study, no samples were stored long-term in a biobank for future analyses.

The  healthcare  resource  utilization  (HRU)  included  hospitalizations,  length  of  stay  per  hospitalization, 
acute  physician  visits,  ER  visits,  days  on  antibiotics  and  days  missed  from  work/school  or  unable  to 
perform normal daily activities. 
Data sources and management 
Source Data 
During the study, the MAH contained source data in source documents (original records or certified 
copies), which were in paper and/or electronic format. Source data for this study comprised the 
following: hospital records, medical records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, 
subjects' diaries or evaluation checklists, outcomes reported by subjects, pharmacy dispensing 
records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification 
as being accurate copies, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, 
subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medico-technical 
departments involved in the clinical study. No data was entered directly into the electronic case report 
form (eCRF). 
Subject diary 
An electronic subject diary was provided to each subject/caregiver at enrolment to record the following 
information: 
•  Occurrence of AEs (including infections). The investigator provided guidance for the 
subject/caregiver regarding identification and documentation of AEs. 
•  Concomitant medication used. 
•  Details of the product administration as specified in Study protocol Section 8.7. 
•  Days missed from school/work or unable to perform normal daily activities due to infection or 
other illness. 
•  Non-study-required outpatient visits (including urgent care visits to see healthcare providers) 
and hospitalizations. 
Subjects and/or their parent/legally authorized representatives were trained on use of the diary. The 
investigator had to review the diary for completeness and request the missing information periodically 
and in a timely manner. Untoward events recorded in the diary were reported as AEs according to the 
investigator’s discretion and clinical judgment. 
Subject entries in the diary served as source records for this study. During study participation, the 
investigator had access to the database holding the subject diary data. After the study closure, the 
investigator has received the diary records for their subjects, including audit trail records, in PDF 
format. The data were transmitted to the CRF by a validated transfer. 
Electronic patient-reported (EPR) modules were used to enable deployment of required subject diaries 
to subjects based on protocol requirements. Additionally, EPR compliance reports were in place to 
enable the monitoring of subject compliance, and proactive follow-up, if required. EPRs were deployed 
in local languages, as needed. 
Concerning study documentation, case report forms and document and data retention, the MAH refers 
to the study protocol:

Study Documentation and Case Report Forms 
According to the MAH, the investigator maintained complete and accurate paper format study 
documentation in a separate file. Study documentation included information defined as “source data” 
(see Section 8.8 of the study protocol), records detailing the progress of the study for each subject, 
signed informed consent forms, correspondence with the EC and the study monitor/sponsor, screening 
information, CRFs, SAE reports (SAERs), laboratory reports (if applicable), and data clarifications 
requested by the sponsor. The investigator complied with the procedures for data recording and 
reporting. Any corrections to paper study documentation were performed as follows: 1) the first entry 
was crossed out entirely, remaining legible; and 2) each correction was dated and initiated by the 
person correcting the entry; the use of correction fluid and erasing were prohibited. The investigator 
was responsible for the procurement of data and for the quality of data recorded on the CRFs. CRFs 
was provided in electronic form. 
If eCRFs were provided by the sponsor, only authorized study site personnel recorded or changed data 
on the CRFs. If data was not entered on the CRFs during the study visit, the data was recorded on 
paper, and this documentation was considered source documentation. Changes to a CRF was required 
documentation of the reason for each change. An identical (electronic/paper) version of the complete 
set of CRFs for each subject remained in the investigator file at the study site in accordance with the 
data retention policy (see Section 17.3 of the study protocol). 
The handling of data by the sponsor, including data quality assurance, complied with regulatory 
guidelines (e.g., ICH GCP) and the standard operating procedures of the sponsor. Data management 
and control processes specific to the study was described in the data management plan. 
Document and Data Retention 
The investigator retains study documentation and data (paper and electronic forms) in accordance with 
applicable regulatory requirements and the document and data retention policy, as described in the 
Clinical Study Agreement. 
CHMP comment: 
Based on the provided information concerning the data sources and variables, the MAH conducted the 
study as planned and with no significant changes as described in the final approved study protocol. 
Study size 
Approximately 40 pediatric subjects with PIDD were planned to be enrolled. A total of 49 subjects were 
screened; 42 subjects received investigational product (IP); and 39 subjects completed Epoch 2. All 
the 42 subjects were analyzed for safety and efficacy of HyQvia. For information on sample size 
calculation refer to section “statistical methods”. 
CHMP comment: 
By enrolment of 42 subjects, the study size was acceptable and the initially planned number of 40 
enrolled subjects was reached.

Data transformation 
The MAH states that throughout the study data handling and recordkeeping procedures were 
performed by the study sponsor to ensure that the captured data were accurate, consistent, complete, 
and reliable (described in the study protocol (Section 17 of the study protocol)). 
The investigator was responsible for the procurement of data and for the quality of data recorded on 
the CRFs. The eCRFs were provided by the sponsor, and only authorized study site personnel recorded 
or changed data on the eCRFs. The data available on the paper source documents, were transferred to 
eCRFs. Changes to a CRF required documentation of the reason for each change recorded in audit trail. 
An identical (electronic/paper) version of the complete set of CRFs for each subject remained in the 
investigator file at the study site in accordance with the data retention policy (refer to study protocol 
Section 17.3). The handling of data by the sponsor, including data quality assurance, complied with 
regulatory guidelines (e.g. ICH GCP) and the standard operating procedures of the sponsor. Data 
management and control processes specific to the study were described in the data management plan. 
Statistical methods 
In the final study report, it is described that subjects were classified into the following analysis sets: 
Screened Set, Enrolled Set, Full Analysis Set, and Safety Analysis Set. 
Sample Size Calculation: 
The study was not designed for statistical hypothesis testing. The sample size selected for the study 
was primarily determined by the objective to collect safety data on HyQvia in a sufficient number 
(about 40) of pediatric (age 2 to <18 years) subjects with PIDD who had received prior 
immunoglobulin therapy before enrolment into this study. In addition, the guideline of the CHMP 
(Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, 2015) on the clinical investigation of human normal 
immunoglobulin for SC and/or intramuscular administration indicated that at least 40 subjects should 
be included to evaluate replacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency syndromes. Thus, a total of 
42 subjects were enrolled in this study. 
Planned Statistical Analysis: 
Subject disposition and demographic and other baseline characteristics were summarized as described 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Disposition summaries and listings were based on the Screened Set and 
demographics, whereas other baseline characteristics summaries were based on the Safety Set. A 
summary of number and proportion of subjects in different population sets were provided. 
Assessment of safety was the primary objective of this study. The primary endpoints/outcome 
measures (number and rate per infusion [excluding infections] of all severe related AEs, and number 
and rate per infusion [excluding infections] of related SAEs), were analyzed using descriptive statistics. 
In addition, incidence of all severe related AEs and related SAEs were calculated as rate per infusion 
and rate per subject-year. 
A point estimate and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI; by the Wilson score method) for the 
proportion of subjects with one or more related SAEs and the proportion of subjects with one or more 
severe related AEs were presented for the primary outcome measures. These outcome measures were 
also summarized by clinically meaningful subgroups: sex and age groups. 
For all the secondary safety outcome variables, descriptive methods, mainly frequency tables, were 
used for all secondary safety endpoints. In addition, AEs were summarized in terms of AEs per subject 
(rate per subject), AEs per infusion, AEs per subject-year. 
Assessment report  
EMA/ 885669/2022 
Page 20/59 
 
 
 
 
 
Descriptive statistics were also performed for all the secondary efficacy outcome variables as well as 
for other outcome variables (mode of product administration, HRQoL, infections, Healthcare Resource 
Utilization [HRU]). 
A single, formal, prospectively planned interim analysis of data (cut-off date: 14 May 2020) was 
performed to update the scientific community, on the interim safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity 
of HyQvia in pediatric subjects with PIDD. 
Missing unused, and spurious data 
According to the MAH, data that appeared to be spurious (e.g., outliers, incompatible with life) were 
queried by Clinical Data Management and then were either corrected or explained in the Clinical Study 
Report (CSR) if not correctable. Outliers were not excluded from analysis unless otherwise specified. 
Any exclusion of data from analysis was appropriately footnoted in the relevant TFLs. 
Quality control 
Throughout the study, the investigator complied with the protocol and applicable regulatory 
requirements, fulfilled his responsibility to conduct all aspects of the study at the study site and 
verified by signature the integrity of all data transmitted to the MAH. The study monitor ensured 
appropriate training of the personnel and verifying that each study site conducted the study according 
to the protocol, standard operating procedures, other written instructions/agreements, and applicable 
regulatory guidelines/requirements. Data handling and recordkeeping procedures were performed by 
the study sponsor to ensure that the captured data were accurate, consistent, complete, and reliable, 
as described in the study protocol. Audits were performed by the MAH as described in the clinical 
quality management plan. 
CHMP comment: 
Based on the provided information concerning the quality control, statistical methods and data 
transformation, the MAH conducted the study as planned and with no significant changes as described 
in the final approved study protocol. 
CHMP comment: 
Research Methods:  
Notably, in the final study report the MAH does not comment on potential measures that were taken to 
minimize bias in the study. Please discuss how bias in the study has been minimized by addressing 
potential sources of bias (e.g. concerning the enrolment of eligible subjects) and describing the 
resulting measures that were taken throughout the study to minimize bias (OC 1) (see also Assessor 
comment after “Descriptive data”).

7.5.1.  Results 
Participants 
A total of 42 subjects met eligibility criteria and were enrolled and dosed in the study. All these 
subjects were included as Enrolled Set, which was identical to the Full Analysis Set and Safety Analysis 
Set. Of all the subjects enrolled in this study, most of the subjects (39 [92.9%] subjects) completed 
Epoch 2. One subject from HyQvia new starter group discontinued Epoch 2 and entered Epoch 3 due to 
a severe related treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) of emotional distress. Three (7.1%) subjects 
prematurely discontinued the study: 1 (2.4%) subject before completing Epoch 1 (HyQvia new starter) 
and 2 (4.8%) subjects before completing Epoch 2 (both HyQvia pre-treated subjects). Reason for 
study discontinuation in all 3 subjects was withdrawal by the subject and none of these 3 subjects 
discontinued due to any TEAE. 
CHMP comment: 
The MAH clearly presents the number of participants involved in analyses and the proportion of 
subjects excluded throughout the study including reasons.  
Descriptive data 
There was over four-fold higher proportion of male subjects (81.0%; n=34/42) than the female 
subjects (19.0%; n=8/42) enrolled, and the distribution was similar across both the groups. Most 
(97.6%, n=41/42) of the subjects enrolled were white and had median body mass index of 18.55 
(range: 12.3 to 32.7) kg/m2; and this was similar across both the groups. Within the subjects enrolled 
in this study, the most commonly diagnosed primary immunodeficiency was of the common variable 
type (42.9% n=18/42), followed by X-linked agammaglobulinemia (38.1%, n=16/42) (Table 2).

The median age of the subjects was 11.5 (range: 3 to 17) years (HyQvia new starter subjects: 11.0 
(range 3 to 17) years and HyQvia pre-treated subjects: 12.0 [range 3 to 17] years) (Table 3): 
Table 3: from Table 3 of the clinical study report: Demographic and Baseline Characteristics-Safety 
Analysis Set 
Medical History 
All enrolled subjects (included under Safety Analysis Set) had at least one medical history. The most 
frequently (≥10 subjects) reported medical history by SoC was immune system disorders (57.1%, 
n=24/42); followed by congenital, familial and genetic disorders (52.4%, n=22/42); respiratory, 
thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (40.5%, n=17/42); and infections and infestations (38.1%, 
n=16/42). All other medical histories by SoC were reported in less than 10 subjects. 
The most frequently (≥10 subjects) reported history by PT were Bruton's agammaglobulinemia (35.7%, 
n=15/42) and immunodeficiency common variable (38.1%, n=16/42). All other medical history was 
reported in less than 10 subjects. 
Prior Medications 
Over 90% of the subjects had taken at least one prior medication (92.9%, n=39/42). All the 39 
subjects who had taken at least one prior medication had taken the immune sera and immunoglobulins 
(immunoglobulins, normal human) whereas, analgesics (Anilides) and anti-bacterials for systemic use 
(Penicillins with extended spectrum) were reported for 1 (2.4%) subject each. 
Concomitant Medications 
Overall, a total of 38 (90.5%) subjects received at least one concomitant medication during the study. 
The most frequently reported concomitant medications in ≥10 subjects by therapeutic class included: 
anti-bacterials for systemic use (23 [54.8%] subjects); analgesics (16 [38.1%] subjects); cough and 
cold preparations (13 [31.0%] subjects); medications for obstructive airway diseases (11 [26.2%] 
subjects); and antihistamines for systemic use (10 [23.8%] subjects). During this study, 14 (33.3%) 
subjects were treated with any other non-therapeutic products. The rest of the concomitant 
medication, non-drug therapies, and procedures were reported in less than 10 subjects. 
CHMP comment: 
Notably, all participants of the study were Hispanic or Latino and all but one patient were white (for 
one patient race was “not applicable” as not collected by local regulations). Thus, the significance of 
this study may be restricted to the Caucasian population and potential differences between ethnicities 
cannot be determined.

Furthermore, in this study, PIDD most frequently diagnosed was the primary immunodeficiencies of 
the common variable type (42.9% n=18/42) and the X-linked agammaglobulinemia (38.1%, 
n=16/42). For the other types of PIDD, only a limited number of subjects was included. 
Overrepresentation of males in the study set is due to the high proportion of X-linked 
agammaglobulinemia in the study. The MAH should include the topic of the enrolment of eligible 
subjects, in particular regarding a potential selection bias of the target population (high proportion of 
X-linked agammaglobulinemia in the study, overall representation of the frequencies of the different 
PIDD types in the study population) in the discussion of the bias in this study (cf. OC1). 
Of note, most patients in the study were 6 to <18 years old. Only 3 patients who were 2 to <6 years 
old were enrolled. 
Patient’s medical histories, prior and concomitant medications are in line with the known susceptibility 
of the patients to infections associated with PIDD. 
Main results and adverse events/adverse reactions 
Efficacy Evaluations 
Trough levels of IgG (Epoch 1 and Epoch 2) 
The baseline defined for HyQvia new starter subjects was the study baseline visit and for HyQvia pre-
treated subjects Epoch 2 Month 0 visit was defined as the baseline visit. 
Overall, no substantial differences in total IgG trough levels across timepoints were observed in the 
change from baseline values to Epoch 2 Month 12. The mean and median change in IgG trough levels 
from baseline to Epoch 2 Month 0 were 0.143 g/L and -0.220 g/L, at Epoch 2 Month 6 were 0.100 g/L 
and -0.235 g/L and Epoch 2 Month 12 were -0.306 g/L and 0.220 g/L, respectively. Similar trend in 
change from baseline in trough levels were observed for HyQvia new starters and HyQvia pre-treated 
subjects. Serum levels of mean and median trough IgG at the Epoch 2 Month 0 visit were 8.801 g/L 
and 8.535 g/L, respectively, at the Epoch 2 Month 6 visit were 8.862 g/L and 8.735 g/L, respectively 
and at the Epoch 2 Month 12 visit were 8.469 g/L and 8.720 g/L, respectively. The decrease in the 
mean total serum IgG trough levels at Month 12 could be attributed to a 11-year old male who had a 
critically low trough serum IgG level of 1.43 g/L (change from baseline: -8.00 g/L) at Epoch 2 Month 
12 visit. This was attributed to an event of inflammatory bowel disease that was ongoing at study 
completion. In this case this clinically significant abnormal IgG value constituted an unrelated AE, 
which was attributed to the alternate etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. 
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful differences in trough IgG levels across age groups during 
Epoch 2, with the highest mean change from the baseline measurement of -1.276 g/L and the highest 
median change from the baseline measurement of -1.145 g/L during the study. Mean IgG levels in 
subjects across age groups at baseline and Month 0 remained similar however, for age group of 12 to 
<18 years, the mean IgG levels at Month 6 and Month 12 was comparatively higher than the other two 
age groups of 2 to <6 years and 6 to <12 years.  
A total of 13 subjects reported abnormal IgG levels between baseline and Epoch 2 Month 12 visit, with 
a clinically significant abnormal value in 6 subjects. Among 5 of these 6 subjects, the abnormal values 
were attributed to pre-existing disease. 
A slight change from baseline in the mean trough levels within all the IgG subclasses were observed at 
different timepoints. Between the IgG subclasses, the change from baseline values at Epoch 2 Month 
12 showed quite high variability. The mean and median changes from baseline of IgG subclass trough 
levels were similar across HyQvia new starters and HyQvia pre-treated subject.

In terms of trough levels of specific antibodies to clinically relevant pathogens, at the Epoch 2 Year 1 
termination visit, all the subjects had mean trough levels of specific antibodies against Clostridium 
tetani toxoid, Haemophilus influenzae B, and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) nearly 10 times the levels 
considered to be the minimal protective titer. 
Health-related quality of life 
Quality of life was assessed using the Peds-QL and EQ-5D questionnaires. A parent or a legally 
authorized representative completed the questionnaires on behalf of subjects aged less than 13 years 
and subjects aged 13 to <18 years completed the questionnaires themselves. 
The responses on Treatment Preference Questionnaire were obtained for 15 of 42 subjects (HyQvia 
new starters: 6 subjects; HyQvia Pre-treated: 9 subjects). At baseline, majority of the subjects that 
responded to the questionnaire preferred administration of the immunoglobulin therapy at home 
(14/15 subjects, 93.3%). The responses were similar across HyQvia new starters and HyQvia pre-
treated subjects. 
The data on Treatment Preference Questionnaire could be obtained from 20 subjects at the end of 
Epoch 2. From the available data, at the end of Epoch 2, all the analyzed subjects (n=20, 100%) 
reported that they would choose to continue using HyQvia treatment. These subjects also provided 
positive responses (liked very much/liked) towards preference for HyQvia in terms of the ability to fit 
treatment into schedule (total subjects with ‘liked very much’ or ‘liked’ responses: 100.0%; subjects 
with ‘liked very much’(responses: 50.0% / subjects with ‘liked’ responses: 50%). About ≥90% of 
the subjects that responded to the questionnaire provided positive responses towards preference for 
HyQvia with respect to the overall convenience (95.0%; 30.0%/65.0%) and the number of needle-
sticks per month (90.0%; 45.0%/45.0%). Furthermore, majority of subjects provided positive 
responses to frequency of administration (85.0%; 45.0%/40.0%), total time spent for the treatment 
per month (75%; 35.0%/40.0%), ease of administration (85.0%; 35.0%/50.0%), potential to self-
administer (85.0%; 50.0%/35.0%), amount of time the administration takes (80.0%; 35.0%/45.0%), 
complexity of the administration process (70.0%; 25.0%/45.0%), and self-administer without medical 
supervision (85.0%; 45.0%/40.0%). 
Responses to the TSQM-9 were obtained for 13 of 42 subjects at baseline. The mean (SD) TSQM9 
scores for medication at baseline were 82.05 (18.308), 67.95 (23.587), and 84.07 (10.970) for 
effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction, respectively. At the end of Epoch 2, the mean (SD) 
TSQM-9 scores for the effectiveness (n=23), convenience (n=24), and global satisfaction (n=24) were 
76.09 (22.686), 73.84 (14.137), and 80.06 (16.582), respectively. 
Regarding the treatment satisfaction with HyQvia assessed using TSQM 9 scale at the end of Epoch 2, 
due to the amount of missing ePROs data and thus the small sample size available (n=23 for the 
effectiveness evaluation, n=24 each for convenience and global satisfaction evaluation) the results 
should be interpreted with caution for this outcome parameter. 
Similar to TSQM 9, the data should be interpreted with caution for the QoL assessments by Peds-QL 
and EQ-5D questionnaires at the end of Epoch 2, due to the amount of missing ePROs data as well as 
the small size for the Peds-QL total score (2 to 4 years old [n=1]; 5 to 7 years [n=1]; 8 to 12 years 
[n=3]; 13 to <18 years [n=8]) and the EQ-5D questionnaire (n=12). 
The subjects were not able to go to school or work or to perform normal daily activities due to infection 
or other illness at a rate of 7.51 days per subject-year. The rate of hospitalizations was less than 1 per 
subject-year, and the rate of days hospitalized was also less than 1 day per subject-year. The rate of 
acute physician visits due to infection or other illness was less than 1 visit per subject-year. All these

rates were similar across HyQvia new starter subjects and HyQvia pre-treated subjects, with a 
relatively lower rate observed among the HyQvia new starters. 
The rate of days on antibiotics was 64.02 days per subject-year. The rates of days on antibiotics were 
similar across HyQvia new starter subjects and HyQvia pre-treated subjects, with a relatively lower 
rate observed among the HyQvia new starters. 
During the study, 1 ASBI of pneumonia (bacterial pneumonia) was reported in 1 (2.4%) subject who 
belonged to HyQvia new starter group; this event was reported as an SAE, which was assessed as not 
related to HyQvia treatment. 
The rate of all infections per subject-year was 1.486; the rates were similar across both the HyQvia 
new starter and HyQvia pre-treated groups. 
Safety Evaluations 
The MAH states that the mean dose received per body mass per week was 0.13 (range: 0.1 to 0.3; 
SD=0.046) g/kg/week across all the subjects during Epoch 2. Overall, the mean HyQvia treatment 
exposure during Epoch 2, number of infusions, infusion per month, and number of infusions sites were 
similar across HyQvia new starters and HyQvia pre-treated groups, as observed from the mode of 
administration results. A mean of 18.9 infusions were administered per subject, with 1.28 mean 
infusions administered per month. The mean duration of infusion (overall: 89.0 mins) was similar 
across the HyQvia new starters and HyQvia pre-treated subjects, with a comparatively lower duration 
observed among the HyQvia new starters, which may be attributable to lower volume infusions 
received by HyQvia new starters during Epoch 1 or Epoch 2.  
The mean number of infusion sites per infusion was 1.47 (SD=0.466) and was similar across HyQvia 
new starters and HyQvia pre-treated subjects. The maximum infusion rates per site (overall mean: 
177.64 mL/h/site) were comparable across both the groups. The mean infusion volume per site was 
139.72 mL. HyQvia pre-treated subjects had a comparatively higher mean infusion volume per site 
compared with HyQvia new starters. Despite infusion interruptions, almost all the subjects completed 
their infusions. 
Two (2) severe related TEAEs (1 local and 1 systemic) were reported during the study, both reported 
in 1 (2.4%) 11-year old subject from the HyQvia new starters group, who had several ongoing medical 
conditions. This subject discontinued the HyQvia treatment due a severe related TEAE of emotional 
distress, entered Epoch 3, and completed the study. No severe related TEAEs were reported in the 
HyQvia pre-treated subjects. 
Tables 4 and 5 summarize the severe TEAEs by SOC and PT and the overall TEAEs/ARs (excluding 
infections), respectively.

Table 5: from Table 9 of the clinical study report: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events and Adverse 
Reactions, Overall Summary (excluding infections)-Safety Analysis Set 
Generally, a higher proportion of the TEAEs/ARs were reported among the HyQvia new starter subjects 
than the HyQvia pre-treated subjects and the proportion of subjects experiencing local ARs (excluding 
infections) (33.3% subjects) was higher compared to the proportion of subjects experiencing systemic 
ARs (excluding infections). 
Amongst the total amount of 41 local related and/or temporally associated TEAEs, the most commonly 
reported (≥10%) local TEAEs by PT were infusion site pain and infusion site pruritus. Most of the local 
TEAEs/ARs were assessed as mild, only 1 was severe. 
Assessment report  
EMA/ 885669/2022 
Page 28/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of the total 111 systemic TEAEs were assessed as mild and unrelated. Amongst the total 
amount of 22 systemic local related and/or temporally associated TEAEs (excluding infections), the 
most commonly reported systemic TEAEs by PT were pyrexia and gastrointestinal disorders. 
Excluding infections, overall rates of systemic ARs (related systemic TEAEs) per infusion and per 
subject were <0.1 and 0.214, respectively. Excluding infections, the overall rates of local ARs (related 
local TEAEs) per infusion and per subject were <0.1 and 0.952, respectively. This corresponds to lower 
overall rate of systemic ARs per subject-year (0.171) compared with local ARs per subject-year 
(0.762). 
A total of 8 serious TEAEs (including infections) were reported in 7 (16.7%) subjects (dental caries, 
inflammatory bowel disease, idiopathic orbital inflammation, pyrexia, acute sinusitis, pharyngitis, 
pilonidal cyst and pneumonia) and 4 serious TEAEs (excluding infections) were reported in 3 (7.1%) 
subjects. Six out of 8 serious TEAEs were reported in the HyQvia pre-treated subjects, while the 
remaining 2 serious TEAEs were reported in the HyQvia new starters. However, none of these serious 
TEAEs were considered to be related to HyQvia by the investigator. 
No death among analyzed subjects was reported during the conduct of this study. 
None of the subjects developed binding anti-rHuPH20 antibodies with a titer ≥160, and therefore none 
was assessed for neutralizing anti-rHuPH20 antibodies (as per protocol). Most of the subjects had a 
negative test result for binding anti-rHuPH20 antibodies or a titer of 5; the highest titer was 80. 
Assessment of hemolysis and other clinical laboratory parameters did not raise any safety concerns 
with respect to HyQvia administration. No substantial changes from baseline were observed in the vital 
signs and physical examinations among the study subjects during the study. 
CHMP comment: 
The MAH presents adverse events adequately in a tabular format. The most frequently described adverse 
events were general disorders and administration site conditions, which were already identified through 
the development program for HyQvia. 
It has to be noted that questionnaires Peds-QL and TSQM-9 were completed by only a limited sample 
size  (roughly  a  third  to  half  of  the  subjects)  from  the  42  enrolled  subjects.  Generally,  treatment 
preference and satisfaction with HyQvia and physical and mental health stayed largely at the same level 
during the study. Also, the rate of hospitalizations and the amount of days on which the subjects were 
not able to go to school or work or to perform normal daily activities due to infection or other illness was 
at a low level.  
7.6.  Discussion 
The MAH states that overall, the safety data in this study are consistent with results obtained in 
Clinical Studies 160603 and 160902, as well as in the literature among patients with PIDD. 
None of the reported SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to HyQvia. The total 
number of SAEs (8 serious TEAEs [including infections] were reported in 7 subjects and 4 serious 
TEAEs [excluding infections] were reported in 3 subjects). 
One 11-year old subject discontinued treatment with HyQvia during Epoch 2 due to a severe related 
TEAE of emotional distress who entered Epoch 3, and then completed the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/ 885669/2022 
Page 29/59 
 
 
 
 
 
The subject had several ongoing medical conditions. Overall, the AEs and ARs (regardless of the 
location [local/systemic], severity [mild/moderate/severe], and causality [related/related and/or 
temporally associated]) were observed at a relatively higher proportion among the HyQvia new 
starters than the HyQvia pre-treated subjects. 
Most of the related TEAEs were mild in severity, with only 2 severe related TEAEs (1 local and 
systemic) both reported in 1 (2.4%) subject from the HyQvia new starter group, the 11-year old boy, 
mentioned above. Local TEAEs were reported in 14 (33.3%) subjects and were representative of local 
ARs at the infusion site (except for 1 local TEAE of infusion site rash in HyQvia new starter subject). 
The majority of the local TEAEs were reported among HyQvia new starter subjects. Except for 1 severe 
event, all the local TEAEs were assessed as mild. Excluding infections, the overall rates of local ARs 
(related local TEAEs) per infusion, per subject, and per subject-year were <0.1 (rate: 0.050), 0.952, 
and 0.762, respectively; this corresponded to lower overall rate of systemic ARs per subject-year 
(0.171) compared with local ARs per subject-year (0.762). 
Overall, the rates of systemic TEAEs per infusion, per subject, and per subject-year were 0.140, 2.643, 
and 2.115, respectively; most of these events were assessed as mild and unrelated to HyQvia. During 
the total study period, the rates of systemic ARs per infusion, per subject, and per subject-year were 
<0.1 (rate: 0.011), 0.214, and 0.171, respectively. 
None of the subjects developed binding anti-rHuPH20 antibodies with a titer ≥160, and therefore none 
were assessed for neutralizing anti-rHuPH20 antibodies (as per protocol). Assessment of hemolysis and 
other clinical laboratory parameters did not raise any safety concerns with respect to HyQvia 
administration. 
In terms of efficacy evaluations, the total IgG levels in general were similar across Epoch 2. Given the 
overall mean trough IgG level at baseline was 8.776 g/L and at Epoch 2 Month 12 was 8.469 g/L, the 
mean IgG levels during Epoch 2 were well above what could be considered a putative therapeutic 
protective threshold of 7 g/L. 
The serum trough IgG levels between age groups during Epoch 2 also showed no clinically meaningful 
differences; with the highest mean change from the baseline measurement of -1.276 g/L and the 
highest median change from the baseline measurement of -1.145 g/L during the study. A similar trend 
was observed for IgG subclass levels with no substantial changes from baseline across Epoch 2 and no 
notable age group differences. 
At the time of the completion visit, the mean trough levels of specific antibodies against Clostridium 
tetani toxoid, Haemophilus influenzae B, and HBV in all subjects were at 10 times the levels considered 
to be the minimal protective titers. 
A total of 795 infusions were administered during the study. Overall, the mean number of infusions per 
month was 1.28 (SD=0.184), with similar proportions observed across HyQvia new starter subjects 
and HyQvia pre-treated subjects. The mean number of infusion sites per month was 1.67 (SD=0.777), 
with similar mean number of infusion sites per month observed across HyQvia new starter subjects 
and HyQvia pre-treated subjects. The mean duration of infusions among all the study subjects was 
89.0 mins, and was comparatively lower among the HyQvia new starter subjects (mean: 79.2 
[SD=30.29] mins) than HyQvia pre-treated subjects (mean: 104.7 [SD=35.07] mins). This could be 
attributed to the relatively higher mean infusion volume per site (overall: 139.72 [SD=89.755] mL) 
noted among the HyQvia pre-treated subjects (178.23 [SD=98.523] mL) than the HyQvia new starters 
(112.39 [SD=71.427] mL). 
The rate of ASBI occurrences among the study population was as low as 0.019 per subject-year. The 
efficacy of HyQvia was further demonstrated by the annualized rate of all infections per subject, 
Assessment report  
EMA/ 885669/2022 
Page 30/59 
 
 
 
 
 
consistent with results obtained in Clinical Studies 160603 and 160902. The rate of all infections per 
subject-year was 1.486; the rate was similar across both the HyQvia new starter and HyQvia pre-
treated groups. The most frequently reported infections (occurring in ≥10% subjects) by PT included: 
rhinitis, gastroenteritis, and nasopharyngitis. 
At the end of Epoch 2, the treatment preference questionnaire indicated a high preference for the 
HyQvia treatment. Most of the analyzed subjects provided positive responses for the majority of 
questions in the Treatment Preference Questionnaire, in particular for ability to fit treatment into 
schedule, the overall convenience, and number of needle-sticks per month. All the subjects expressed 
a preference for continuing treatment with HyQvia. Besides treatment preference, the current study 
further evaluated treatment satisfaction with HyQvia using the TSQM-9 assessment, as well as quality 
of life using the Peds-QL and EQ-5D questionnaires. However, given the small sample size due to the 
amount of missing ePROs data, result of these outcome parameters should be interpreted with caution. 
In terms of HRU outcome measures, the rate of hospitalizations was less than 1 per subject-year and 
the rate of days hospitalized was also less than 1 day per subject-year. The rate of days wherein a 
subject was not able to go to school or work or to perform normal daily activities due to infection or 
other illness was low (7.51 days per subject-year). The rate of acute physician visits due to infection or 
other illness was less than 1 visit per subject-year. The rate of days on antibiotics of 64.02 days per 
subject-year and the total days on antibiotics (mean 146.1 days) are for specific infections not treated 
by immunoglobulins such as pneumocystis pneumonia. 
CHMP comment: 
Apart from commenting on the small sample size concerning the TSQM-9 assessment and quality of 
life Peds-QL and EQ-5D questionnaires, the MAH does not discuss possible further limitations of the 
study. Moreover, no statement with regards to the generalisability of the study was posed. 
The MAH is asked to further discuss the limitations (e.g. concerning study population, impact of home 
administration on AE reporting, missing data…) and comment on generalisability of the results to other 
(pediatric) populations (OC 2). 
The results of the current study are in line with the findings of the PASS 161302 that confirmed rare 
occurrence of rHuPH20-reactive binding antibodies with no evidence for neutralizing activity in the 
subjects.  
The Health-Related Quality of Life and Health Resource Use questionnaires did not reveal significant 
fluctuations in physical or mental health or satisfaction of the patient with the treatment during study 
progression. Overall, the subject’s satisfaction with HyQvia treatment was high.  
7.7.  Conclusion 
The MAH states that HyQvia was found to be safe and tolerable among pediatric subjects (2 to <18 
years old) with PIDD. During the course of this study, the rate of TEAEs, both local and systemic, was 
low; a total of 2 treatment-related severe TEAEs at a rate of <0.1 (rate: 0.003) TEAE per infusion were 
reported and none of them were deemed serious. The rate per infusion of serious TEAEs (excluding 
infections) was <0.1 (rate: 0.005) with only 4 serious TEAEs (excluding infections) reported in 3 
HyQvia pre-treated subjects. None of these were related to the treatment. Most of the ARs reported 
during the study were mild in severity. The rates of local ARs and systemic ARs were lower among the 
HyQvia pre-treated group compared to the HyQvia new starter group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/ 885669/2022 
Page 31/59 
 
 
 
 
 
No substantial difference in the total IgG trough levels and IgG subclass levels across timepoints from 
baseline was observed, and the protective IgG levels were maintained throughout Epoch 2 among all 
the study subjects with similar levels observed across age groups. 
Since none of the subjects developed binding anti-rHuPH20 antibodies with a titer ≥160 at any 
timepoint, the levels of neutralizing anti-rHuPH20 antibodies were not assessed for any subject. 
The rate of ASBI occurrences among the pediatric subjects with PIDD was as low as 0.019 per subject-
year. The efficacy of HyQvia was further demonstrated by the annualized rate of all infections per 
subject, consistent with results obtained in Clinical Studies 160603 and 160902. The rate of all 
infections per subject-year was 1.486; the rate was similar across both the HyQvia new starter and 
HyQvia pre-treated group. 
The majority of the subjects achieved a treatment interval of 4 weeks and maintained a treatment 
interval of 3 or 4 weeks for 12 months during Epoch 2. Overall, HyQvia was able to be administered 
subcutaneously at the same dosing interval as IV immunoglobulin therapies for PIDD, with a mean of 
1.28 infusions per month and duration of 89.0 mins, with a good tolerability profile for both local and 
systemic ARs. For all the analyzed subjects, HyQvia was the preferred mode of immunoglobulin 
therapy for continuation. 
CHMP comment: 
The current PASS provides further data on the use of HyQvia in the pediatric population.  
Overall, the rate of reported AEs is low and reflects the known safety profile for HyQvia. Two (2) 
severe TEAEs related to HyQvia treatment were reported (infusion site pain and emotional distress), 
both in the same subject, who discontinued the Epoch 2 of the study due to emotional distress. 
The study confirms that high levels of rHuPH20-reactive binding antibodies are rare. Most of the 
subjects had a negative test result for binding anti-rHuPH20 antibodies or a titer of 5. Neutralizing 
antibodies were not assessed as no subject developed anti-rHuPH20 antibodies with a titer ≥160 could 
be detected, which supports a previous PASS with HyQvia (161302) that the formation of neutralizing 
antibodies upon administration of HyQvia does not pose a risk to the efficacy of the product.  
Stable and sufficiently protective IgG levels determined throughout the study and a low rate of acute 
serious bacterial infections (ASBI) occurrences among the pediatric subjects with PIDD (0.019 per 
subject-year) underline the efficacy of HyQvia treatment.  
The Health-Related Quality of Life and Health Resource Use questionnaires did not reveal significant 
fluctuations in physical or mental health or satisfaction of the patient with the treatment during study 
progression. Overall, the subject’s satisfaction with HyQvia treatment was high.  
No new safety concerns were identified following HyQvia treatment in pediatric subjects with PIDD who 
had received immunoglobulin therapy prior to study enrolment. 
The benefit-risk balance remains unchanged. 
An update to the RMP resulting from the data presented in this PASS final study report was submitted.

Clinical trial exposure 
The cut-off dates for the cumulative duration of exposure and the cumulative numbers for the age 
groups and genders were updated to 13-January-2021 by the MAH.  
Populations not studied in clinical trials 
The MAH updated the sections of the special populations “breast-feeding women” and “children”. 
Significant changes were the removal of the statement “There were no adverse events reported in 
infants assessed as related to HyQvia in median follow-up time of 100 weeks” in the section “breast-
feeding women” (marked in red) and the inclusion of information from the study 161504 in the section 
“children” (marked below in yellow).

Post-authorisation experience 
The MAH updated the exposure / cumulative sales numbers for HyQvia: 
Missing information  
In the new RMP version 13.1, the MAH updated the table “presentation of the missing information” 
concerning limited information on safety in pregnant and lactating women and limited information on 
safety in neonates or infants <2 years old and on long-term treatment in patients under the age of  
18 years (removed text in red and added text indicated in yellow).

The changes in part II “safety specification” of the RMP are well-founded and thus acceptable. 
9.2.  Summary of the safety concerns 
Compared to the last by the EMA approved version, there were no changes concerning the safety 
concerns of HyQvia.

Limited clinical data on the potential for long-term local and systemic 
reactions  related  to  potential  antibody  development  against 
rHuPH20. 
Considering the data in the safety specification, the safety concerns listed above are appropriate. 
9.3.  Pharmacovigilance plan 
The MAH removed the studies 161302 and 161504 from the list of additional pharmacovigilance 
studies since these studies have been finalized. The updated Pharmacovigilance plan is as follows:

Assessor comment: 
The MAH removed the studies 161302 and 161504 from the list of additional pharmacovigilance 
studies since these studies are completed. The editorial changes in part III “pharmacovigilance plan” of 
the RMP are sufficiently justified and thus acceptable. 
Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
The proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the 
risks of the product. 
The studies in the post-authorisation development plan are sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of 
the risk minimisation measures. 
9.4.  Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures 
In Part V.3 “Summary of risk minimisation measures” and Part VI “Summary of the risk management 
plan” of the current RMP, the studies 161504 (category 3) and 161302 (category 1) were removed 
(indicated in red) as additional pharmacovigilance activities and from “Other studies in post-
authorisation development plan”.

Assessor comment: 
In part V “risk minimisation measures” of the RMP, the MAH removed the finalized studies 161302 and 
161504. Further, detailed information on educational material for healthcare professionals and patients 
including a dairy for patients were added following the procedure EMEA/H/C/002491/II/0070/G. 
The amendments are sufficiently justified and thus acceptable. 
Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the 
proposed indication(s).  
Addition of specific information on educational material for healthcare professionals and patients and 
inclusion of a dairy for patients are endorsed. 
9.5.  Annexes 
The studies 161302 and 161504 have been moved from Table 1 Annex 2 “Planned and ongoing 
studies” to Table 2 Annex 2 “Completed studies”, and they have been removed from Annex 3 Part C 
“Previously agreed protocols for ongoing studies and final protocols not reviewed by the regulatory 
authority”. 
Furthermore, in Annex 6, the MAH added details of proposed additional risk minimisation activities, 
namely the provision of educational material (refer to section “additional risk minimisation measures” 
of this AR). 
Also, Annex 7 (“Other supporting data”-Literature) and Annex 8 (“Summary of changes to the RMP”) 
have been updated.  
Assessor comment:  
The changes in the annexes are in line with the described amendments in the RMP parts II, III, V and 
VI. The annexes have been updated appropriately. 
9.6.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP are acceptable. 
10.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to include a paragraph 
on the pediatric population reflecting the PASS study: 
HyQvia was evaluated in 42 pediatric subjects (age 2 to <18 years), in a Phase 4, non-controlled, 
multicenter study in pediatric subjects who had received prior immunoglobulin therapy. No new safety 
concerns were identified following HyQvia treatment in pediatric subjects with PIDD. 
The Package Leaflet (PL) has not been altered, as the information in the SPC concerns PASS study data 
that had no negative impact on safety.

Changes are made to the Opinion Annex II conditions (Section D) regarding the RMP and additional risk 
minimisation measures (see above evaluation). 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
CHMP comment: 
The changes to the SmPC and Annex II are, in general, acceptable. 
However, in the pivotal study 160603 there were 8 of the 24 paediatric patients who had total anti-
rHuPH20 antibodies positive at certain time points, 2 of these had levels at or above 1:160. None had 
neutralising antibodies. This information should be added to 4.8. prior to the PASS Study information.  
Furthermore the PASS study 161504 is not mentioned in the listing of studies that have been performed – 
please add. 
See OC 4 a +b  
10.1.1.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, HyQvia is removed from the additional 
monitoring list as the PASS is fulfilled.  
Therefore, the statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this 
will allow quick identification of new safety information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black 
triangle, is removed from the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.

Section 4.8 
Paediatric population 
a) Please update text as highlighted in yellow 
In the pivotal study 160603 there were 8 of the 24 paediatric patients with total anti-rHuPH20 
antibodies positive, 2 of 8 had levels at or above 1:160. None had neutralising antibodies. 
A prospective, Phase 4, multicentre study in Europe evaluated 42 paediatric subjects (age 2 to 
<18  years)  who  had  received  prior  immunoglobulin  therapy  (Study  161504).  No  new  safety 
concerns  were  identified.  No  subject  was  positive  (titer  ≥160)  for  binding  antirHuPH20 
antibodies. HyQvia was found to be safe and tolerable among paediatric subjects (2 to <18 years 
old) with PIDD. 
Results  of  clinical  studies  indicate  similar  safety  profiles  in  adults  and  paediatric  population, 
including the nature, frequency, seriousness and reversibility of adverse reactions. 
b) In the tabulated list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 (“The safety of HyQvia was evaluated

Question 1 
Please discuss how bias in the study has been minimized by addressing potential sources of bias. For 
example, please discuss the enrolment of eligible subjects, in particular a potential selection bias of the 
target population (high proportion of X-linked agammaglobulinemia in the study, representation of the 
frequencies of the different PID types in the study population). Further, please describe the resulting 
measures that were taken throughout the study to minimize bias. Even though an imbalance of the 
study population might not change the overall validity of the data or have an impact on section 5.1 in 
the SmPC, a potential bias in the study has not been discussed in the final study report at all and a 
statement by the MAH concerning the points mentioned above should be included. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The first subject was enrolled in study 161504 within 12 months of the approval of the paediatric 
indication of HyQvia in Europe. Selection bias was mitigated by asking investigators to include all 
successive PID subjects who were already treated with, or who were considered for, HyQvia treatment, 
reducing the risk that investigator concerns about compliance or predicted response (channelling bias) 
to HyQvia might have influenced enrolment. In addition, to strengthen external validity, inclusion and 
exclusion criteria were intentionally minimal and broad enough to capture subjects with any PID type 
who were treated with, or who were considered for, treatment with HyQvia. 
More than 38% of enrolled subjects had congenital X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in our study. 
Whereas this may be higher than expected in an adult population, XLA is one of the most common PID 
subtypes occurring in the paediatric population because age at onset for many PID subtypes occurs in 
adulthood. For example, age at onset and age at diagnosis for patients with CVID, one of the most 
common PID subtypes, typically occur in the third and fourth decades of life, respectively (mean 
[median] age at onset: 26.3 [24] years; mean [median] age at diagnosis: 35.3 [33] years). Since this 
study was specifically intended to enrol a paediatric population, it is not unexpected that 38% of this 
sample has the XLA subtype. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH adequately describes the potential selection bias as well as measures how bias was avoided 
in the study and discusses representation of the target population in the study. Issue resolved.

Question 2 
The MAH is asked to further discuss the limitations (e.g. concerning study population, impact of home 
administration on AE reporting, missing data…) and comment on generalisability of the results to other 
(pediatric) populations. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Study 161504 was conducted at 16 centres across seven countries. Included centres were large, 
academic hospital systems, typical of where PID patients receive treatment worldwide. Despite this 
global generalizability, there are several limitations associated with this study. Unfortunately, the 
impact of home administration on AE reporting is unknown. We acknowledge that this setting of 
administration may lead to underreporting or overreporting of AEs; however, more research is needed 
to understand the potential magnitude and direction of bias. Though missing data related to home 
infusion date and infusion rate was more prevalent than expected, we do not have evidence that AEs 
were impacted in a similar manner. We especially do not believe that reporting of serious AEs was 
significantly impacted by home administration given the serious nature of these events. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Limitations of the study have been described including home administration which bears the risk of 
underreporting of AEs. However, the significance of potential under- or over reporting could not be 
evaluated and remains unclear. Issue resolved. 
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
 No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Question 3 
The MAH is requested to expand on whether the intended submission of an Addendum to the CSR will 
affect the current outcome data of PASS study 161504. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH supports the opinion that the submission of the Addendum to the CSR does not affect the 
current outcome data of PASS study 161504. The purpose of this Addendum to the Clinical Study 
Report (CSR) is i) to provide updated Protocol Deviation Listings in Appendix 16.2.2 as well as revised 
language in CSR section 10.2 ‘Protocol Violations/Deviations’ to cover deviations involving the lack of 
seroconversion evaluations of study subjects for HIV-2 infection as well as ii) to refer in Section 10.2 to 
the outcome of a quality investigation on a previously mentioned potential issue with CME/BD 
BodyGuard™ infusion pump systems.  
Assessment report  
EMA/ 885669/2022 
Page 53/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ad i) Lack of seroconversion evaluations of study subjects for HIV-2 infection: 
Per study protocol, the subjects should be evaluated for HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections at screening and 
excluded if they had a positive test result. Subjects should also have been evaluated for HIV-1 and 
HIV-2 infections at study completion. Evaluations for HIV-1 were performed on all subjects, however 
not for HIV-2. The potential impact of the central laboratory not performing the HIV Type-2 test on the 
study results is described below: • No subject entered the study with a known history of HIV Type-1 or 
Type-2. • HIV Type-2 has low prevalence in the study countries in comparison with the HIV Type1. • In 
this post-authorization study, HIV Type-1 and Type-2 infections are not listed as contraindications to 
the use of the study drug (Baxalta Innovations GmbH, 2018). Therefore, given this information and 
the fact that the primary objective of the study was safety of the treatment in the post-authorization 
setting, the assessment was made that subject safety and data integrity were not impacted.  
Ad ii) Outcome of a quality investigation on a previously mentioned potential issue with CME/BD 
BodyGuard™ infusion pump systems:  
While section 10.2, item 1 of the CSR had already mentioned a quality issue related to the potential of 
under-infusion (infusion administration flow rate) when using the CME/BD BodyGuardTM infusion pump 
system at high flow rate settings, a respective quality investigation had still been ongoing at the time 
of the CSR. The investigation confirmed that there was no serious breach of GCP or the study 
protocol and thus no impact on patient safety or data integrity. The potential of under-infusion 
leading to a reduced clinical effect was communicated to IQVIA by MESM Ltd. (Third Party Vendor) on 
13 Sep 2021. The study protocol recommended low infusion rates for the first two doses, with a 
maximum of 300mL/h/site for subjects with BW of ≥40 kg. The protocol also specified that if infusions 
had been tolerated after the subject received two IP infusions at the dose for the final infusion interval, 
then investigators may choose an infusion rate schedule at their own discretion. Below are some more 
details on this issue: • MESM shared that their supplier CME/BD had informed them of a possible issue 
with CME/BD BodyGuard™ infusion pump systems. BD identified potential flow rate issues when using 
the CME/BD BodyGuard Microsets/Bodysets infusion sets. The investigation conducted by BD showed 
an increased risk of under-infusion (affecting flow rate) when using the pump system at high flow rate 
settings. Deviations of nominal accuracy (5-7%) were detected above 500 mL/h and were most 
prevalent and significant (˃20%) when running infusions at flow rates ≥800 mL/h. The per protocol 
recommended maximum infusion rate, as described above, was 300 mL/h/site (subjects ≥ 40 kg). 
BD’s investigation into the root cause of this issue is ongoing. • There was a total of 795 infusions 
performed during the study. The infusion rate was recorded for 667 infusions. On average, the 
reported infusion rates per infusion site fell between 20 mL/h/site and 300 mL/h/site. The data on 
infusion rate per infusion site was missing for a total 128 infusions and this information could not be 
retrieved from the sites as the subjects did not record the infusion rates for these home-infusions. • 
The SmPC-recommended maximum infusion rate of 300 mL/h/site was shared with the study sites for 
home and clinic visits. It is therefore unlikely that the infusion rates which have not been recorded 
exceeded this limit. • During the study, all the subjects were routinely tested for IgG levels. The IgG 
values were within the expected range in all but  
1 subject (where the IgG reduction was attributed to an SAE of inflammatory bowel disease). This 
provides further evidence that the IP infusions were performed properly and in accordance with the 
study protocol and the pump manufacturer’s instructions. Therefore, the MAH concluded that there was 
no impact on patient safety or data integrity. The malfunctioning was relevant for the high flow 
rates only, which was not the case for the study.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH submitted an addendum to the CSR with the purpose to provide additional information on 
protocol deviation (PD) listings concerning missing seroconversion evaluations of subjects who might 
have been infected with HIV-2 at study entry. Moreover, information on the results of a quality 
investigation of the used infusion pump systems ‘CME/BD BodyGuard™’ is provided.   
At screening of study 161504, patients should have been screened for HIV-1 and -2, however, the 
testing was not performed for species HIV-2. The CSR section 10.2 was updated accordingly. Overall, 
173 subject-level PDs were documented in 42 subjects during the study, 45 (instead of 47) were 
considered major PDs. However, it seems that category ‘laboratory assessments not performed’ was 
not updated, thus, the missing testing is regarded and classified as minor protocol deviation. It is 
concurred that the prevalence of HIV-2 in the study countries is very low (2-4%) and, more important, 
that there is no contraindication to the administration of HyQvia in these patients. Thus, the unknown 
serostatus of study subjects with potential HIV-2 infection is deemed tolerable and the classification as 
minor PD can be accepted as it does not carry significant consequences, i.e. increase the risk or 
decrease the benefit to the patient or significantly affects subject’s right, safety or welfare and/or 
integrity of the research data. Issue resolved. 
The potential impact of under-infusion when using systematically higher flow rates with the CME/BD 
BodyGuard infusion pump was further investigated. The MAH concludes ‘that there was no serious 
breach of GCP or the study protocol and thus no impact on patient safety or data integrity’. The vast 
majority of infusion rates was documented during the study, and the applied rates (20-300mL/h) were 
well below the threshold (>500 mL/h) of malfunctioning of the infusion pump system. Subject’s 
measured IgG trough levels were within the envisaged therapeutic range suggesting no relevant 
dysfunction of the infusion system. The amended text in CSR section 10.2 is therefore agreed as no 
further regulatory action is considered necessary. Issue resolved. 
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
 No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

Paediatric population 
a) Please update text as highlighted in yellow 
In  the pivotal study 160603 there  were 8 of the 24 paediatric  patients with total anti-rHuPH20 
antibodies positive, 2 of 8 had levels at or above 1:160. None had neutralising antibodies. 
A prospective, Phase 4, multicentre study in Europe evaluated 42 paediatric subjects (age 2 to <18 
years) who had received prior immunoglobulin therapy (Study 161504). No new safety concerns 
were identified. No subject was positive (titer ≥160) for binding antirHuPH20 antibodies. HyQvia 
was found to be safe and tolerable among paediatric subjects (2 to <18 years old) with PIDD. 
Assessment report

Results  of  clinical  studies  indicate  similar  safety  profiles  in  adults  and  paediatric  population, 
including the nature, frequency, seriousness and reversibility of adverse reactions. 
b) In the tabulated list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 (“The safety of HyQvia was evaluated 
in 4 clinical studies (160602, 160603, 160902, and 161101) in 124 unique patients with PID 
receiving 3,202 infusions”) the PASS study 161504 is not mentioned; this should be updated.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Regarding point a): Takeda respectfully disagrees with EMA´s request to add the “8 of 24 paediatric 
patients with total anti-rHuPH20 antibodies as positive” language to section 4.8 of the SmPC, since 
titers less than 160 are not related to de novo anti-drug antibody formation, but rather related to the 
passive transfer of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies that are present in the IgG component of the HyQvia 
product itself. Approximately 5% of the US adult population test positive for rHuPH20-reactive 
antibodies in the absence of exposure to rHuPH20 (Rosengren 2018) 3 Study was designed to estimate 
a ‘threshold’ factor to distinguish samples that were positive for the generation of host antibodies 
versus positive values that could reflect passive transfer of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in specific lots of 
KIOVIG from different donor populations, which was the basis of the 160-titer cut-off value (please 
refer to the Halozyme Report  included under “Additional Information” in the submission package). In 
addition, subjects in the pivotal Study 160603 submitted with HyQvia´s original MAA in September 
2011 (“Efficacy, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Comparison of Immune Globulin Intravenous 
(Human), 10% (GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG) Administered Intravenously or Subcutaneously 
Following Administration of Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) in Subjects with Primary 
Immunodeficiency Diseases”), who were identified to have X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA), 
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), or Hyper IgM and were not capable of producing mature 
antibody responses, also had anti-rHuPh20 antibody titer less than 160 in their plasma (please refer to 
the data in Table 1 extracted from the CSR of study 160603) 
Based on the arguments above, Takeda believes that including information of titers <160 in the 
HyQvia SmPC is not particularly helpful to prescribers, and rather could be misleading, when in fact it 
would only be an attribute of all polyclonal Ig products because they are generated from normal 
donors who have naturally occurring anti-rHuPH20 antibodies. Therefore, Takeda suggests the 
Assessment report  
EMA/ 885669/2022 
Page 57/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following text in section 4.8 of the SmPC (please refer to the updated PI in the submission package): 
“In the pivotal study 160603 there were 2 of the 24 paediatric patients with total anti-rHuPH20 
antibody levels at or above 1:160. None had neutralising antibodies”. 
Regarding point b): 
Takeda respectfully disagrees to the PASS study 161504 being added to the tabulated list of adverse 
reactions in section 4.8. According to the SmPC guideline from September 2009 4, section 4.8 should 
always include a pediatric population sub-section. From the PASS study 161504, the frequency, type, 
and severity of adverse reactions in children have been determined to be the same as in adults. No 
additional safety issues have been found. Consequently, Takeda suggests that the pediatric PASS trial 
data be included under the pediatric part rather than being combined with the clinical study tabulation. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Ad a) The proposed approach to include information on patients with anti-rHuPH20 antibody levels at 
or above 1:160 can be accepted based on the applicant’s justification. Issue resolved. 
Ad b) As the safety results of study 161504 are mentioned in the paediatric subsection of section 4.8, 
the rationale is acceptable. Issue resolved. 
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
 No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Question 5 
Additional monitoring: Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, HyQvia is removed 
from the additional monitoring list as the PASS is fulfilled. Therefore, the statement that this medicinal 
product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle, is removed from the summary of 
product characteristics and the package leaflet. 
MAH response: Takeda agrees with the assessor´s proposal to remove the additional monitoring from 
the proposed SmPC. Please refer to the updated SmPC. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The request was adequately addressed. Issue solved.

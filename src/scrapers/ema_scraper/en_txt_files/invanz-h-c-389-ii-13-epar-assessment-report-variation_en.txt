1. 
Introduction 
Ertapenem  sodium  is  a  sterile,  synthetic,  long-acting,  parental,  1β-methylcarbapenem  that  is 
structurally  related  to  β-lactam  antibiotics  with  activity  against  a  wide  range  of  gram-positive  and 
gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. 
The bactericidal activity of ertapenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated 
through ertapenem binding to penicillin binding proteins. 
Ertapenem  sodium  is  a  white  to  off-white  hygroscopic,  crystalline  solid.  It  is  soluble  in  water  and 
0.9% sodium chloride solution, practically insoluble in ethanol, and insoluble in isopropyl acetate and 
tetrahydrofuran.  
Invanz  is  supplied  as  sterile  lyophilised  powder  for  intravenous  infusion  after  reconstitution  with 
appropriate  diluent  and  transfer  to  50  ml  0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  Injection;  or  for  intramuscular 
injection  following  reconstitution  with  3.2  ml  of  1%  lidocaine  hydrochloride.  Each  vial  contains  
1.046 grams (g) ertapenem sodium, equivalent to 1 g ertapenem.   
The initial Marketing Authorisation was granted on 18 April 2002 by the European Commission. 
In November 2004 the MAH submitted the present type II variation to include “Complicated skin and 
soft tissue infection, including diabetic foot infections” for the current approved indications:  
“Treatment of the following infections in adults when caused by bacteria known or very likely to be 
susceptible to ertapenem and when parenteral therapy is required:  
• 
Intra-abdominal infections 
•  Community acquired pneumonia 
•  Acute gynaecological infections” 
On  the  basis  of  the  results  of  a  clinical  study  named  “Protocol  034”,  a  prospective,  randomised, 
multicenter,  double-blind,  active-treatment-controlled,  non-inferiority  study  to  evaluate  the  safety, 
tolerability,  and  efficacy  of  ertapenem  versus  piperacillin/tazobactam  (P/T)  in  the  treatment  of 
diabetic  foot  infections  (DFI)  in  adults,  the  MAH  submitted  an  application  for  an  extension  of 
indication of the use of Invanz to “Complicated skin and soft tissue infection, including diabetic foot 
infections”.  Further  to  the  assessment  of  the  data  submitted,  the  extension  of  indication  has  been 
restricted to “diabetic foot infections of skin and soft tissue”.

Clinical efficacy 
(cid:131)  Description of the main study: Protocole 034. 
Protocol  034  was  a  prospective,  randomised,  multicentre,  double-blind,  active-treatment-controlled, 
non-inferiority  study  conducted  in  89  centres  in  the  USA  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  and 
efficacy of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) in the treatment of diabetic foot infections 
(DFI)  in  adults.  This  study,  which  began  on  27  April  2001  (FPI)  and  ended  21  April  2004,  was 
anticipated to enrol 600 patients (300 on ertapenem) from 89 study sites in the United States, in order 
to  achieve  200  clinically  evaluable  patients  in  each  treatment  group.  Each  patient  was  expected  to 
complete  the  study,  including  follow-up,  within  6  weeks.  Last  Patient  Out  (LPO)  was  on  21  April 
2004 and all data was received in-house by 24 June 2004.

(cid:131)  Methods and results from the main study: Protocole 034.

Methods 
The newly submitted study (P034) was initiated in 27 April 2001 and finished in 21 April 2004, and 
conducted at 89 centres in the United States. 
The  study  was  conducted  in  conformance  with  applicable  country  or  local  requirements  regarding 
ethical committee review, informed consent, and other statutes or regulations regarding the protection 
of the rights and welfare of human subjects participating in biomedical research. 
Study objectives 
-  The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  ertapenem  and 
piperacillin/tazobactam with respect to the clinical response in patients evaluable for clinical efficacy 
at the Discontinuation of IV Therapy Assessment.  
-  Secondary  objectives  were  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  ertapenem  and  piperacillin  /tazobactam  in 
patients evaluable at the Follow-Up Assessment, 10 days post antibiotic therapy with respect to: 
a. Clinical response in patients at the Follow-Up Assessment. 
b.  Clinical  and  microbiological  response  at  the  Follow-Up  Assessment  in  patients  with  a  confirmed 
microbiologic pathogen. 
c. Clinical response in patients at DCIV therapy. 
2.  To  compare  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  ertapenem  and  piperacillin/tazobactam  with  respect  to 
drug-related adverse experiences (AEs), drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs), and drug-related 
adverse events (AEs) leading to study drug discontinuation. 
As  an  additional  exploratory  objective,  the  study  also  aimed  at  the  evaluation  of  the  relationship 
between  the  Diabetic  Foot  Infection  (DFI)  Wound  Score  of  the  primary  wound  site  and  clinical 
response. 
Enrolment - Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied in order to enroll patients with appropriate diabetic foot 
infections that were likely to require 5 to 28 days of parenteral therapy and were not complicated by 
preexisting  conditions  which  could  confound  the  evaluation  of  the  efficacy  or  safety  profiles  of  the 
study drugs. 
Particularly, the following inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered: 
-  For a clinical diagnosis of diabetic foot infection, patients must have had well-documented signs 
and symptoms of acute infection located on or above the foot, but not extending past the knee.  
-  For  patients  who  had  received  a  >7  day  course  of  prior  antibiotic  therapy  or  in  whom 
pseudomonas  infection  was  suspected,  wound  cultures  were  to  be  taken  to  rule  out  pathogens 
resistant to either study drug. If culture results identified pathogen(s) resistant to either study drug 
after initiating treatment but the patient showed clinical improvement the patient could remain in 
the  study  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator  (upon  ammendment  of  the  initial  protocol,  which 
required that patients with resistant pathogens at screening would not be enrolled). 
In cases in which patients had prior surgery, at least 7 days must have elapsed before entry into the 
study. 
Infection  had  to  be  without  the  presence  of  unremovable  indwelling  foreign  material  (such  as 
prosthetic  or  surgical  hardware)  or  evidence  of  gangrene  that  could  not  be  removed  with 
debridement.  In  cases  in  which  surgical  debridement  and  wound  approximation  was  performed, 
and, in the opinion of the physician, there was a need to maintain sutures in the wound, the patient 
was considered eligible if all other criteria were met. 
- 
- 
-  Patients  who  receive  empiric  vancomycin  therapy  for  treatment  of  enterococcal  or  MRSA 
infection or a history of MRSA infection would be considered clinically and   microbiologically 
Invanz-H-389-II-13 
3/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unevaluable if entry cultures are only positive for methicillin resistant S. aureus or other organisms 
susceptible to vancomycin. Patients treated with vancomycin who have mixed infections will be 
considered  clinically  evaluable.  Gram-positive  pathogens  will  be  non-evaluable  and  gram-
negative pathogens and anaerobes will be evaluable. 
-  Patients  who  received  more  than  24  hours  of  systemic  antibiotic  therapy  known  to  be  effective 
against the presumed or documented etiologic pathogen(s) within the 3 days prior to receipt of the 
first  dose  of  study  drug,  except  for  those  patients  entered  as  clinical  failures  on  prior  antibiotic 
therapy with a positive baseline wound culture, would be considered non-evaluable. In addition, 
any non-study antibiotic therapy administered between the time of the first dose of study drug and 
the follow-up assessment would make the patient nonevaluable. 
Patients  with  known  or  suspected  osteomyelitis  underwent  an  additional  review.  The 
roentgenographic  changes  characteristic  of  osteomyelitis  can  take  several  weeks  to  appear  on  plain 
films,  resulting  in  falsely  negative  x-ray  findings  early  in  infection.  Before  the  assessment  of 
evaluability  was  made,  a  determination  of  whether  osteomyelitis  was  present  at  eligibility  screening 
was made based on the date of diagnosis. A window of 7 days from eligibility screening was selected 
as  a  conservative  estimate  for  detection  of  pre-existing  osteomyelitis.  Patients  with  osteomyelitis 
diagnosed within 48 hours of initiation of study therapy were considered clinically non-evaluable due 
to  baseline  medical  condition  unless  all  infected  bone  was  removed  as  described  in  the  DAP.  For 
patients with osteomyelitis detected between 48 hours and Study Day 7, the investigator was queried 
to confirm whether osteomyelitis was present at study entry. If, in the investigator’s clinical judgment, 
osteomyelitis was present at study entry, the patient was clinically non-evaluable. If osteomyelitis was 
diagnosed after Study Day 7, the patient was considered a clinically evaluable failure, unless, in the 
opinion  of  the  investigator,  extenuating  circumstances  precluded  classification  as  a  failure,  in  which 
case the clinical response could be indeterminate. 
The  studied  population  cannot  be  considered  representative  for  the  major  group  of  patients  with 
diabetic  foot  infections,  which  generally  includes  osteomyelitis  and  severely  impaired  perfusion. 
Therefore as patients with osteomyelitis have not been included in this study, the CHMP decided that 
a statement should be included in section 4.4 of the SPC to reflect that the efficacy of ertapenem in 
the treatment of diabetic foot infections with concurrent osteomyelitis has not been established. 
Adult  patients  with  diabetes  mellitus  who  met  all  of  the  entry  criteria  and  had  a  clinically  or 
bacteriologically documented diabetic foot infection (defined as at least the presence of cellulitis with 
or without ulceration, or purulent discharge) judged by the investigator to require parenteral antibiotic 
therapy for a minimum of 5 days and a maximum of 28 days were enrolled. For a clinical diagnosis of 
diabetic foot infection, the primary site of infection was required to have either purulent drainage from 
the wound and/or at least 3 established signs and symptoms of acute infection located on or above the 
foot, but not extending past the knee. 
Patients  had  an  initial  eligibility  screening  assessment  within  48  hours  prior  to  initiation  of  study 
therapy  that  included  a  complete  physical  examination,  detailed  clinical  wound  assessment  of  the 
primary  and  any  secondary  wounds,  a  baseline  wound  culture,  and  an  x-ray  examination  of  the 
involved lower extremity. Investigators were instructed to make every attempt to obtain a deep tissue 
culture,  however  if  no  culture  was  obtained  or  if  no  baseline  pathogen  was  isolated,  the  patient 
remained in the study for clinical evaluation. If culture results from an appropriately obtained wound 
specimen were not available at the time of the eligibility screening, a patient could have been entered 
into  the  study  pending  the  culture  results.    If  the  culture  results  were  negative,  then  the  patient  was 
considered  to  be  nonevaluable  and  must  have  been  withdrawn  from  the  study.  (Subsequently,  in 
Protocol Amendment 02, this was further elaborated to include: If the culture results  were negative, 
but the patient showed clinical improvement, they could be continued in the study at the investigator’s 
discretion.)  If  the  baseline  culture  was  known  prior  to  enrolment  to  contain  a  pathogen  resistant  to 
either study drug, the patient should not have been enrolled in the study. If the baseline culture was 
found  during  the  study  to  be  resistant  to  either  of  the  study  drugs  and  there  was  no  clinical 
improvement,  the  patient  should  have  been  discontinued  as  a  failure;  if  the  patient  was  improving, 
he/she  was  allowed  to  remain  in  the  study  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator.  (Subsequently,  in 
Protocol Amendment 02, this was further elaborated to include : Patients with pathogens identified as 
Invanz-H-389-II-13 
4/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resistant to either study drug after initiating study therapy but who showed clinical improvement could 
be continued in the study at the discretion of the investigator.) 
Randomisation 
Diabetic patients who met all of the entry criteria were randomised to 1 of the 2 study regimens in a 
1:1 ratio. Allocations were stratified for severity of disease based on the baseline classification of the 
primary wound according to the University of Texas Wound Classification Scale. Infections classified 
as  Grade  0  Stage  B,  Grade  0  Stage  D,  Grade  1  Stage  B,  and  Grade  1  Stage  D  were  considered 
moderate diabetic foot infections (Stratum I), while infections classified as Grade 2 Stage B, Grade 2 
Stage  D,  Grade  3  Stage  B,  and  Grade  3  Stage  D  were  considered  severe  (but  not  life-threatening) 
infections (Stratum II).  
Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses 
Five  (5)  amendments  to  the  original  protocol  (34-01,  034-02,  034-04,  034-05,  and  034-06)  were 
implemented  prior  to  unblinding  the  study.  One  amendment  (034-03)  incorporating  an  exploratory 
health economics objective was not released to investigators and was never implemented. 
Two amendments were medically significant, both contained in amendment 02 which was the single 
protocol  amendment  that  clarified  multiple  parameters  for  the  study.  Also  in  this  protocol,  was  the 
clarification for evaluability of :  “The evaluability criteria were revised to indicate that patients who 
received more than 24 hours of systemic antibiotic therapy known to be effective against the presumed 
or documented etiologic pathogen(s) within the 3 days prior to the first dose of study therapy would be 
non-evaluable, except for those patients entered as clinical failures on prior antibiotic therapy.” These 
and other details of the amendments appear to increase/clarify the details of study parameters without 
changing their material nature, including clarifications of primary wound site in patients with multiple 
sites  of  infection  in  the  lower  extremity  so  that  the  tertiary  objective  evaluating  the  Diabetic  Foot 
Infection Wound Score and clinical response was clarified to apply only to the primary wound. 
Study medication and Dosage 
Ertapenem was given as a single daily dose of 1 g IV.  P/T was given at 3.375 g per dose IV every 
6 hours.  To  maintain  blinding,  a  matching  IV  placebo  was  administered  at  hours  6,  12,  and  18  to 
patients  randomised  to  receive  ertapenem.  The  recommended  duration  of  therapy  was  5  to  28  days.  
Consistent with common clinical practice for the management of patients with DFI, investigators had 
an option to switch patients after at least 5 days of IV study therapy to a protocol specified oral follow-
up antibiotic, amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg Q12 hours), if they had responded sufficiently and had 
met  protocol-specified  criteria  for  clinical  improvement.    Patients  were  to  receive  at  least  5  days  of 
parenteral therapy and to receive no less than 80% of the minimum and no greater than 120% of the 
maximum  recommended  antibiotic  (IV  alone  or  IV  plus  optional  oral)  study  therapy.  With  the 
exception of open-label vancomycin for resistant Gram-positive infections, use of non-study systemic 
or  topical  antimicrobials  was  not  permitted.  Open  label  vancomycin  was  permitted  in  this  study  for 
treatment  of  Enterococcus  or  methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus  (MRSA)  according  to  the 
usual practice of the investigator.  
The  comparator  in  the  study,  P/T,  has  a  broad  spectrum  of  in  vitro  activity  encompassing  relevant 
pathogens  in  this  condition  and  is  licensed  for  the  treatment  of  skin  and  skin  structure  infections, 
(including ischemic/diabetic foot infections in the US).  
After  a  period  of  parenteral  study  therapy,  the  patients  could  have  been  switched  to  an  oral 
antimicrobial if they had improved sufficiently.  Patients were required to meet criteria specified in the 
protocol  before  the  investigator  could  have  elected  to  change  to  oral  therapy.  The  oral  switch  agent 
was amoxicillin/clavulanate, 875/125 mg twice daily. The investigator could have utilised another oral 
switch agent if baseline pathogens demonstrated resistance to the protocol-specified oral switch agent 
or if the patient was intolerant of the protocol-specified oral switch agent. 
Open  label  vancomycin  was  permitted  in  this  study  for  treatment  of  Enterococcus  or  methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) according to the usual practice of the investigator. However, 
Invanz-H-389-II-13 
5/31 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
these  patients  were  considered  clinically  and  microbiologically  non-evaluable  if  entry  cultures  were 
only  positive  for  Gram-positive  organisms.  Patients  who  received  vancomycin  may  have  been 
considered evaluable if they had mixed Gram-positive and Gram-negative or anaerobic infections; in 
the  per  pathogen  analyses  for  these  patients,  only  the  Gram-negative  pathogens  and  anaerobes  were 
considered  and 
the  outcomes  for  vancomycin  susceptible  Gram-positives  were  considered 
indeterminate. 
The  ertapenem  dose  for  this  study  was  based  on  the  results  of  the  Clinical  Pharmacology  multiple-
dose study, and upon the susceptibility of the organisms presumed to be the infecting bacteria, and/or 
Phase III data. Piperacillin/tazobactam was chosen as the comparator because it is used commonly to 
treat diabetic foot infections and has been previously shown to be safe and effective in treating these 
infections.  The  dosage  selected  was  the  usually  recommended  dose  for  this  indication.  It  should  be 
noted that the US dose regimen for piptazobactam (3 g piperacillin/375 mg tazobactam) delivers the 
same  total  daily  dose  of  each  component  as  4  g/500  mg  t.i.d.  but  the  plasma  profiles  are  inevitably 
different. There are currently no oral antibiotics indicated for the treatment of diabetic foot infections. 
Amoxicillin/clavulanate was chosen as the oral switch agent because it is commonly used to treat skin 
and skin structure infections and has activity both in vitro and in clinical studies against the aerobic 
and anaerobic pathogens commonly associated with diabetic foot infections, such as Staphylococcus 
aureus(methicillin-sensitive).  The  usual  adult  dose  for  amoxicillin/clavulanate  is  500 mg  every  
12  hours.  For  more  severe  infections  the  dose  should  be  875  mg  every  12  hours  or  500  mg  every  
8 hours. For this study a dose of 875 mg every 12 hours was chosen. 
Efficacy evaluation 
Clinical  assessment  of  the  infectious  process  was  performed  at  eligibility  screening,  Day  5  of  IV 
therapy, at the discontinuation of IV therapy (DCIV), at the discontinuation of oral therapy (DCOral) 
and at the Follow-up Assessment 10-day post antibiotic therapy (FUA). Overall clinical response was 
evaluated by the investigator at the DCIV and FUA visits. Microbiological response assessments were 
made separately for each pathogen identified at eligibility screening. Patients were monitored daily for 
adverse experiences and tolerability at the site of study drug infusion. 
The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of DCIV clinically evaluable patients who had a 
favorable clinical response assessment at the DCIV visit. Clinical response assessments were made by 
the investigator for all patients at Day 5 of IV Therapy, DCIV Visit, DCOral Visit and FUA Visit. For 
the efficacy analysis, only the clinical responses at DCIV and the FUA were considered. 
The  secondary endpoints were: (1) The proportion of FUA clinically evaluable patients who had a 
favorable  clinical  response  assessment  (“cure”  or  “improvement”)  at  the  Follow-Up  Assessment,  10 
days  post  antibiotic  therapy.  (2)  The  proportion  of  FUA  clinically  and  microbiologically  evaluable 
patients who had both a favorable clinical (“cure” or “improvement”) and favorable microbiological 
(“eradication”  or  “presumptive  eradication”)  response  to  baseline  pathogens  at  the  Follow-Up 
Assessment 10 days post antibiotic therapy. (3) The proportion of FUA clinically evaluable patients 
who had a favorable clinical response assessment (“cure” or “improvement”) at Discontinuation of IV 
therapy. 
The exploratory endpoints were: (1) The DFI Wound Score of the primary wound at all scheduled 
time  points.  (2)  The  proportion  of  FUA  microbiologically  evaluable  patients  who  had  a  favorable 
microbiological response assessment (“eradication” or “presumptive eradication”) at Discontinuation 
of IV Therapy Assessment. (3) The proportion of FUA microbiologically evaluable patients who had a 
favorable  microbiological  response  assessment  (“eradication”  or  “presumptive  eradication”)  at  the 
Follow-Up Assessment, 10 days post antibiotic therapy. 
A  microbiological  response  was  assessed  separately  for  each  pathogen  identified  in  the  prestudy 
wound and blood cultures at the DCIV, DCOral, and FUA visits.

Definitions of populations 
The following terms are used to describe the study populations analysed in this study: 
• Screened population: all patients who signed a consent form for the study. This population includes 
those  patients  who  were  not  randomised  to  therapy  and  those  patients  who  were  randomised  to 
therapy. 
•  Randomised  population:  a  subset  of  the  screened  population  comprised  of  patients  who  were 
randomised  to  a  study  regimen,  irrespective  of  whether  the  patient  actually  received  study  therapy. 
Patients randomised  to one treatment group who, due to dispensing errors, mistakenly received study 
therapy  with  the  other  study  treatment  for  the  entire  parenteral  study  period  were  analysed  and 
displayed  throughout  the  report  based  on  the  study  therapy  actually  received.  No  patients  received 
both parenteral study medication at any time during the study. 
• Treated Population: a subset of the randomised  population comprised of patients who received at 
least one dose of study therapy. Only treated patients are included in the safety analysis. 
• Clinical Modified Intent-to-Treat (MITT) population: a subset of the treated population that met 
the minimal disease definition. The Microbiologic MITT population, a subset of the clinical MITT 
population,  was  comprised  of  those  clinical  MITT  patients  who  had  a  baseline  pathogen  identified, 
regardless of susceptibility to study agents, and a microbiological response assessed. Determination of 
the  clinical  and  microbiologic  MITT  populations  was  made  prior  to  unblinding  using  prespecified 
criteria as indicated in the DAP . 
•  DCIV  Clinically  Evaluable  population:  a  subset  of  the  clinical  MITT  population  comprised  of 
patients  who  met  the  evaluability  criteria  specified  in  the  DAP  up  to  and  including  their 
discontinuation  of  IV  therapy  assessment.  This  population  comprises  patients  in  whom  sufficient 
information was available to determine their outcome at discontinuation of IV therapy and for whom 
no confounding factors were present that interfered with the assessment of that outcome. 
•  FUA  Clinically  Evaluable  population:  A  subset  of  the  DCIV  Clinically  Evaluable  population 
comprised of patients who met the evaluability criteria specified in the DAP up to and including their 
10  day  post-antibiotic  follow-up  assessment.  This  population  comprises  patients  in  whom  sufficient 
information  was  available  to  determine  their  outcome  at  the  follow-up  assessment,  10  days  post-
antibiotic  therapy,  and  for  whom  no  confounding  factors  were  present  that  interfered  with  the 
assessment of that outcome. 
•  The  FUA  Microbiologically  Evaluable  population,  a  subset  of  the  FUA  clinically  evaluable 
population, is comprised of those clinically evaluable patients who had a baseline pathogen identified 
and  a  microbiological  response  assessed  at  FUA.  Furthermore,  it  was  required  that  one  or  more  of 
these baseline pathogens were susceptible to both parenteral study therapies. As all microbiologically 
evaluable  patients  were  required  to  be  clinically  evaluable,  the  population  of  clinically  and 
microbiologically evaluable patients is identical to the microbiologically evaluable population; for all 
data  presented  hereafter,  this  group  will  be  referred  to  as  the  FUA  microbiologically  evaluable 
population. 
(Determinations of evaluability were made prior to unblinding using prespecified criteria as indicated 
in the DAP.)

Profile of Patient Enrolment 
Analysis populations 
Efficacy results were determined using an “evaluable-patients-only” approach and a “modified intent-
to-treat” (MITT) approach. The “evaluable-patients-only” approach was the primary efficacy analysis. 
Two “evaluable-patients-only” populations were identified. The first contained all patients who were 
deemed  clinically  evaluable  up  to  and  including  the  discontinuation  of  their  IV  therapy  assessment. 
The  second  contained  all  patients  who  were  deemed  clinically  evaluable  up  to  and  including  the  
10-day post antibiotic therapy follow-up assessment. The population evaluable at DCIV will be used 
to address the primary hypothesis. All other analyses will be considered in those clinically evaluable at 
the follow-up assessment. 
To  address  the  primary  efficacy  hypothesis,  the  proportion  of  patients  within  each  treatment  group 
who  had  a  favorable  clinical  response  assessment  at  the  discontinuation  of  IV  therapy  among  those 
who  were  clinically  evaluable  at  the  discontinuation  of  IV  therapy  was  calculated.  All  secondary 
hypotheses were considered in the population of patients evaluable at the FUA visit. The endpoints are 
displayed  by  stratum  and  combined  over  strata  within  each  treatment  group.  The  endpoints  are 
displayed by treatment group for each analysis at DCIV and FUA. 
Statistical Methods 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  compare  ertapenem  with  piperacillin  /  tazobactam  in 
terms  of  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  a  “favourable”  (defined  as  cure  or  improved)  clinical 
response.  The primary timepoint was the DCIV visit and the primary analysis population comprised 
those patients who were clinically evaluable at that visit.  Supportive statistical analyses for efficacy 
were  performed  using  a  number  of  different  patient  populations  (described  above).    A  number  of 
secondary  endpoints,  including  microbiological  response,  and  timepoints  were  assessed  (also 
described above).

For  the  efficacy  analysis,  only  the  clinical  responses  at  DCIV  and  the  FUA  were  considered.  For  a 
“favourable” clinical response rating, each primary wound and secondary wound clinically assessed at 
the eligibility screening must have received a “favourable” clinical response rating. An “unfavourable” 
clinical  response  included  “failure”  and  “relapse”.    For  missing  data,  all  assessments  of  “failure”  or 
“relapse” were carried forward to subsequent timepoints. This included patients discontinuing before 
their Day 5 visit, if the patient had received at least 48 hours of treatment.  All assessments of “cure or 
improvement” were carried back to previously missing timepoints provided that no prior assessment 
was available. If a patient was a “cure or improvement” or “indeterminate” at DCIV and was missing 
subsequent timepoints, information available up to 90 days after the discontinuation of drug could be 
used to assess clinical response. 
The response rates, adjusted for baseline severity of infection, were compared using Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel.  Associated 95% confidence intervals were computed.  Ertapenem was to be considered at 
least  as  effective  as  piperacillin  /  tazobactam  if  the  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  difference  in 
proportions  (ertapenem  minus  piperacillin/tazobactam)  contained  zero  and  the  lower  limit  of  the 
confidence  interval  was  greater  than  -15  percentage  points.    A  test  of  the  treatment  by  baseline 
severity interaction was also performed.   
The  statistical  analysis  is  generally  appropriate.    In  particular,  the  analysis  populations  are  sensibly 
defined  and  sufficiently  wide-ranging.    Patient  withdrawals  and  missing  data  are  not  considered 
problematic.  
One  major  concern  related  to  the  criteria  for  success,  i.e.  the  definition  of  a  “favourable”  clinical 
response.  This concern was raised by the CHMP in the Request for Supplementary Information (RSI) 
adopted by the CHMP in June 2005. The MAH answered that determining when a complex process 
like a diabetic foot infection is “cured” can be difficult. Most of these infections resolve slowly with 
treatment,  usually  over  a  period  of  weeks.  The  clinical  assessment  of  “cure/improvement”  as  the 
favorable  clinical  response  at  the  discontinuation  of  IV  therapy  (DCIV)  and  at  the  10  day 
posttreatment  follow-up    (FUA)  in  Protocol  034  required  complete  resolution  of  cardinal  signs  of 
infection  (i.e.,  fever,  purulence,  and  lymphangitis)  and  improvement  in  most  of  the  remaining  signs 
and  symptoms  of  infection  (e.g.,  chills,  fluctuance,  non-purulent  discharge,  erythema,  induration, 
tenderness, pain, skin warmth), since the inflammatory component of these latter signs and symptoms 
may persist to some degree for days, sometimes weeks, after the active infection has resolved.   
As defined in the Protocol, by assigning an outcome of “cure/improvement” at FUA, the investigator 
had  declared  that,  based  on  the  assessment  of  signs  and  symptoms,  the  patient  had  been  essentially 
cured  of  their  infection  and  no  longer  required  antibacterial  therapy.  At  DCIV,  an  outcome  of 
“cure/improvement” was a determination by the investigator that the infected wound(s) had responded 
sufficiently  to  parenteral  study  therapy  so  that  either  (1)  the  patient  was  essentially  cured  and  all 
antibiotic  therapy  could  be  discontinued,  or  (2)  the  patient  had  met  all  required  clinical  response 
criteria as defined in the protocol for oral switch and could be transitioned to oral follow-up therapy as 
per protocol.  Patients were required to have received at least 5 days of parenteral study therapy before 
being  switched  to  oral  follow-up  study  therapy  (ampicillin/clavulanate).    The  following  protocol-
defined oral switch criteria indicative of a substantial response to the parenteral study therapy needed 
to be considered by the investigator: 
1.  Patient received at least 5 full days of IV study therapy; 
2.  For  at  least  24  hours,  the  patient’s  maximum  temperature  was  <38°C  (100.4°F)  orally,  <38.5°C 
(101.2°F)  by  tympanic  measurement,  or  <39°C  (102.2°F)  by  rectal  measurement,  without  the 
influence of aspirin, acetaminophen, or NSAIDS; 
3.  WBC was <10,000/mm3, with ≤5% immature neutrophils (bands) on differential; 
4.  Patient was able to tolerate oral (or resume enteral) feeding and had no suspected impediment to 
absorption, (e.g., gastroparesis, vomiting, bowel edema, right-sided heart failure, etc.);  
5.  Improvement was demonstrated in most (without worsening of any) of the signs and symptoms of 
diabetic  foot  infection  (primary  and  secondary  wound  sites)  including  a  marked  and  sustained 
reduction in the following, if present at enrollment: 
•  Localised periwound erythema 
•  Localised periwound edema (swelling)

baseline. 
Clinical response analyses are discussed below for patients who received parenteral study therapy only 
and  for  patients  who  received  parenteral  followed  by  oral  study  therapy.  The  clinical  response 
analyses  for  patients  who  received  parenteral  study  therapy  only  and  for  patients  who  received 
parenteral followed by oral study therapy were done at both the DCIV and FUA time points.  
For  evaluable  patients  who  received  only  parenteral  study  therapy,  a  clinical  response  of 
“cure/improvement” at the DCIV visit is ostensibly an assessment of “cure,” since these patients were 
discontinued from IV study therapy to receive no further antibacterial treatment. For evaluable patients 
who  received  parenteral  and  then  switched  to  oral  follow-up  study  therapy,  a  clinical  response  of 
“cure/improvement”  at  the  DCIV  visit  represents  “improvement,”  since  these  patients  went  on  to 
receive  oral  follow-up  as  per  Protocol.  All  assessments  of  “cure/improvement”  at  the  FUA  visit  are 
ostensibly  investigator  assessments  of  “cure,”  since  by  Protocol  definition  these  patients  did  not 
require any additional antibacterial therapy for their infected wounds at the time of the FUA. 
Efficacy  analyses  in  the  population  of  patients  who  received  parenteral  therapy  alone  show  that  the 
observed  “cure”  rate  for  ertapenem  was  numerically  superior  and  statistically  non-inferior  to 
piperacillin/tazobactam at both the DCIV and FUA time points. Additionally the observed “cure” rates 
for  the  most  severe  baseline  diabetic  foot  infections  was  numerically  higher  for  ertapenem  at  both 
DCIV and FUA time points. 
The  population  of  patients  who  had  responded  sufficiently  to  parenteral  therapy  and  were  then 
switched  to  oral  study  therapy,  were  by  definition  considered  “improved”  at  the  DCIV  assessment.  
Followed  out  to  the  posttreatment  visit,  a  favorable  assessment  at  FUA  was  indicative  of  a  “cure” 
since the investigator considered no further anti-infective treatment to be required. Cure rates in these 
patients at the FUA time point again showed again that the ertapenem regimen was statistically non-
inferior  to  piperacillin/tazobactam.  Additionally,  the  cure  rate  observed  for  ertapenem  in  the  most 
severe baseline infections was numerically higher than that observed for piperacillin/tazobactam.  
These  results,  in  conjunction  with  the  overall  study  results  and  analyses  of  improvement  and 
resolution in the signs and symptoms of infection over the course of treatment and follow-up, attest to 
the efficacy of ertapenem in resolving the infectious process. They further support the conclusion that 
ertapenem is non-inferior to piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of diabetic foot infections. 
The CHMP  concluded that the MAH has provided a reasoned response based on a clinical/practical 
point of view. It may be considered sufficiently robust to accept the reasoned assumptions elaborated 
by the MAH above i.e. that results from the subgroups treated only by parenteral therapy realistically 
reflect  the  “cured”  category  and  the  subgroups  treated  by  parenteral  and  oral  therapy  realistically 
reflect the “improved” category. The individual results presented under the above assumptions show 
consistency at both DCIV and FUA and may be sufficiently convincing in support of non-inferiority 
between Invanz and the comparator.

There appeared to be very similar proportions of subjects in each treatment group found not evaluable 
by each of the criteria listed in the above table for Clinical Evaluable Population. In the Microbiologic 
Evaluable  Population  however,  there  are  higher  proportions  in  the  comparator  group  found  not 
evaluable and on more detailed assessment, the principal cause of this can be identified i.e. baseline 
microbiology – no pathogen isolated.

The 2 treatment groups appeared to be similar with respect to the extent of exposure to overall study 
therapy,  parenteral  therapy,  and  oral  therapy.  Overall  131  (33%)  of  these  patients  (69/206  and 
62/196 patients  in  the  ertapenem  and  P/T  groups,  respectively)  did  not  receive  any  oral  therapy  and 
were treated entirely with parenteral study therapy.  i.e. sixty-seven percent (66.5%) of the clinically 
evaluable  patients  in  the  ertapenem  group  and  68.4%  of  the  clinically  evaluable  patients  in  the 
comparator  group  completed  therapy  with  an  oral  agent.  Most  patients  in  both  groups  received 
amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg every 12 hours for a mean duration of approximately 9.4 days in 
the ertapenem group and 10.0 days in the piperacillin/tazobactam group.

As  might  be  expected,  the  mean  duration  of  parenteral  therapy  was  longer  in  this  subset  for  both 
treatment  groups  (16.6  and  15.8  days,  respectively,  for  the  ertapenem  and  P/T  groups).  
Approximately two thirds of the patients in both treatment groups received oral switch therapy; 93% 
and  100%  of  these  patients  in  the  ertapenem  and  P/T  groups,  respectively,  received  the  protocol 
specified oral agent, amoxicillin/clavulanate.

including  S.  aureus,  enterococci,  and  Streptococcus  agalactiae,  gram  positive  anaerobic  cocci, 
primarily  Peptostreptococcus  species,  and  gram-negative  bacilli,  including  E.  coli  and  Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa.   
Patients  with  monomicrobial  or  polymicrobial  infections  with  pathogens  that  were  only  non-
susceptible  (intermediate  or  resistant)  to  parenteral  study  therapy  isolated  from  either  the  primary 
infection  site  or  blood  were  clinically  but  not  microbiologically  evaluable  in  cases  where  there  was 
clinical improvement and the investigator elected to continue the patient on blinded parenteral therapy.  
In cases where in vitro susceptibility results to study agents were not reported, all organisms except for 
methicillin-resistant  staphylococci  were  assumed  to  be  susceptible  to  both  ertapenem  and 
piperacillin/tazobactam  for  the  purpose  of  evaluability  determination.  All  methicillin-resistant 
staphylococci were assumed to be resistant to both ertapenem and piperacillin/tazobactam regardless 
of  in  vitro  susceptibility  results.  All  of  the  pathogens  from  a  patient  with  a  polymicrobial  infection 
were  included  in  the  per-pathogen  analyses  regardless  of  baseline  susceptibility  of  each  individual 
pathogen.  If  the  patient  was  also  microbiologically  evaluable,  then  microbiologic  outcomes  were 
assessed for all baseline pathogens regardless of baseline susceptibility of each individual pathogen. 
Polymicrobial infection was defined as an infection in a microbiologically evaluable patient with 2 or 
more different baseline bacterial pathogens.  Non-polymicrobial infection included microbiologically 
evaluable patients with a single baseline pathogen and also patients who were clinically evaluable but 
not microbiologically evaluable.  If vancomycin was used to treat resistant gram-positive infections, 
all gram-positive aerobic organisms were assigned an indeterminate microbiological outcome. 
Of  the  206  FUA  clinically  evaluable  patients  in  the  ertapenem  group  172  (83.5%)  had  at  least  
1  baseline  wound  or  blood  pathogen  identified  at  study  entry.  Ninety-nine  (99)  of  these  (48.1%  of 
FUA clinically evaluable patients) had polymicrobial infections. 
Of the 196 FUA clinically evaluable patients in the piperacillin/tazobactam group 149 (76.0%) had at 
least 1 baseline wound or blood pathogen identified at study entry. Eighty-eight (88) of these (44.9% 
of FUA clinically evaluable patients) had polymicrobial infections. 
The  most  commonly  isolated  pathogens  in  the  FUA  clinically  evaluable  population  were  similar  to 
those  seen  in  the  treated  population.  Staphylococcus  aureus  was  the  single  most  commonly  isolated 
pathogen (90 isolates in the ertapenem group and 79 isolates in the piperacillin/tazobactam group) in 
the  FUA  clinically  evaluable  population.  Seventy-one  (71)  (78.9%)  isolates  in  the  ertapenem  group 
and  64  (81.0%)  isolates  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group  were  methicillin-sensitive  S.  aureus 
(MSSA).   
Overall,  the  distribution  and  susceptibility  patterns  of  baseline  pathogens  in  the  2  treatment  groups 
were  similar  with  the  exception  of  enterococci  and  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa.  In  the  ertapenem 
treatment group, 16.7% (6 of 36) of enterococcal isolates tested were susceptible to ertapenem while 
94.4%  (34  of  36)  of  enterococcal  isolates  were  susceptible  to  piperacillin/tazobactam.    Similarly,  in 
the piperacillin/tazobactam treatment group, 13.6% (3 of 22) of enterococcal isolates were susceptible 
to  ertapenem  while  90.9% 
to 
(20  of  22)  of  enterococcal 
piperacillin/tazobactam.    Vancomycin  susceptibility  was  reported  for  32  enterococcal  isolates  (18  in 
the ertapenem group and 14 in the piperacillin/tazobactam group) and all were vancomycin sensitive.  
In  the  ertapenem  treatment  group,  for  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa,  33.3%  (6  of  18)  of  isolates  were 
susceptible 
to 
piperacillin/tazobactam.  In the piperacillin/tazobactam treatment group, 70% (7 of 10) Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa  isolates  were  susceptible  to  ertapenem  while  80%  (8  of  10)  isolates  were  susceptible  to 
piperacillin/tazobactam.

The  only  pathogens  isolated  from  blood  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group  were  gram-positive 
aerobic  cocci,  methicillin-sensitive  Staphylococcus  aureus,  Streptococcus  agalactiae,  Streptococcus 
pyogenes,  and  Streptococcus  viridans.  All  bacteremic  patients  had  blood  isolates  which  were 
susceptible  in  vitro  to  the  study  drug  received  with  the  exception  of  AN594  which  grew  out 
Streptococcus  viridans  which  was  not  tested,  but  was  presumed  to  be  sensitive  to  both  study  drugs. 
One FUA clinically evaluable patient in the ertapenem group(MRSA) and 2 FUA clinically evaluable 
patients in the piperacillin/tazobactam group (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae) were bacteremic at baseline.   
Clinical efficacy per patient 
To address the primary hypothesis, the estimated proportion, adjusting for baseline severity, of DCIV 
clinically evaluable patients with a favorable clinical response assessment at the DCIV time point was 
evaluated in both treatment groups. 
To  address  another  important  secondary  efficacy  hypothesis,  the  proportion  of  FUA  clinically 
evaluable patients with a favorable clinical response assessment was also evaluated in both treatment 
groups at the 10-day follow-up assessment visit.   
Subgroup Analyses 
Clinical response rates decreased in both treatment groups with increasing depth of the wound (Grades 
0 through 3 according to the University of Texas Diabetic Wound Classification).  Most of the FUA 
clinically  evaluable  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  (68%  in  the ertapenem  group; 66%  in the  P/T 
group)  had  wounds  extending  through  the  epidermis  or  dermis  without  penetration  to  the  tendon, 
capsule or bone (Grade 1). A third of all FUA clinically evaluable of patients in both treatment groups 
(31%) had wounds extending to either the tendon or capsule (Grade 2) or to the bone or joint (Grade 
3) and these infections were appropriately considered severe.

Data Source:  [4.1.1; 4.3.3; 4.3.5; 4.3.13] 
The clinical response with ertapenem seems to be worse with increasing age (90.1% for < 65 years vs. 
81.3%  for  >  65  years  and  89.0%  for  <  75  years  vs.  76.0%  for  >  75  years),  whilst  the  reverse  was 
observed for piperacillin-tazobactam (80.2% for < 65 years vs. 87.7% for > 65 years and 81.2% for  
< 75 years against 90.3% for > 75 years). In patients above 75 years (25 for the ertapenem arm and  
31 for the piperacillin-tazobactam arm) the observed difference between treatments was –14.3, while 
the  difference  between  the  lower  CI95  was  around  20%.  These  differences  also  affect  the 
generalisation of the results from the presented study to the general population. In the RSI adopted in 
June 2005, the MAH was requested to comment upon this issue. 
In his answer, the MAH explained that while the favorable clinical response rates at DCIV and FUA 
were numerically greater for piperacillin/tazobactam in the oldest decades (70 to 79 and 80 to 89 years 
of age) this was not true for patients 50 to 59 or 60 to 69 years age, the age groups with the largest 
proportion  of  patients  studied  and  where  the  ertapenem  response  rates  were  higher.  Upon  careful 
statistical analysis, the data do not appear to support a clear age trend with regard to treatment effect. 
The  MAH  presented  the  data  in  groups  of  10-years,  rather  than  the  dichotomies  described  in  the 
question.    This  has  the  potential  to  mask  differences  of  potential  importance.  However,  the  MAH’s

position, that the data do not appear to support a clear trend for age, is supported by the CHMP, but a 
decreased effect in elderly patients cannot be ruled out based on the data. 
Clinical efficacy per pathogen  
The  most  common  baseline  species  identified  in  the  FUA  clinically  evaluable  population  with 
Diabetic  Foot  Infections  at  the  DCIV  visit  were  gram  positive  aerobic  cocci  including  S.  aureus, 
enterococci, and S. agalactiae; gram-negative aerobic rods including E, coli and P. aeruginosa; gram-
positive  anaerobic  cocci,  primarily  Peptostreptococcus  species,  and  gram-negative  anaerobic  rods, 
including Porphyromonas and Prevotella species.  
S. pyogenes, a well-recognised pathogen in skin/soft tissue infection, was only very rarely observed. 
Despite the study 034 was conducted in US, the epidemiology of the pathogens isolated in Protocol 
034  was  generally  similar  to  other  studies,  which  were  conducted  in  the  EU.  The  evidence  that 
S. pyogenes is uncommon in DFI studies justifies the lack of infections with S. pyogenes in this study. 
The  epidemiology  of  pathogens  is  shown  to  be  broadly  similar  to  those  in  other  EU  studies,  which 
satisfies concerns over external validity. 
There  were  4  ertapenem-targeted  pathogens  for  which  sufficient  numbers  of  isolates  were  available 
(10  per  group,  as  outlined  in  the  Data  Analysis  Plan  [DAP])  to  determine  a  95%  CI  around  the 
difference in clinical response rates between the 2 treatment groups. Among these pathogens, the only 
pathogen  for  which  piperacillin/tazobactam  had  a  higher  clinical  response  rate  than  ertapenem  was 
Streptococcus agalactiae (between treatment difference -13.2; 95% CI: -38.3, 10.9).  The inclusion of 
zero  in  the  95%  CI  around  the  difference  in  response  rates  indicates  that  this  difference  was  not 
statistically significant.  A previous study in skin and skin structure infections demonstrated ertapenem 
had a similar response as piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of S. agalactiae infections. 
The  favorable  clinical  response  rates  for  MRSA  in  both  treatment  groups  also  appear  to  be  similar.  
The MRSA favorable clinical response rates were 14/18 isolates (77.8%) in the ertapenem group and 
10/15 isolates (66.7%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group.   
The  population  of  FUA  clinically  evaluable  patients  with  MRSA  was  further  analysed.    In  the 
ertapenem  group,  6  of  the  18  (33.3%)  FUA  clinically  evaluable  patients  were  monomicrobial 
infections.    In  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group,  5 out  of  15  (33.3%)  of  MRSA  infections  were 
monomicrobial infections. The clinical response rates for MRSA in both treatment groups appear to be 
similar irrespective of the use of concomitant vancomycin.   In the ertapenem group, 7 of 18 (38.8%) 
patients  with  MRSA  had  received  concomitant  vancomycin;  of  the  7  patients  who  had  received 
vancomycin,  5  (71.4%)  had  a  favorable  clinical  response.  Eleven  (11)  patients  did  not  receive

In 
Upon further sub-analysis, the clinical response rates for MRSA in both treatment groups appear to be 
similar  irrespective  of  the  use  of  concomitant  vancomycin  among  monomicrobial  or  polymicrobial 
groups.   In the ertapenem group, 5 of 5 (100%) patients with polymicrobial MRSA infection who had 
not  received  concomitant  vancomycin  had  a  favorable  clinical  response;  of  the  7 patients  who  had 
received  vancomycin,  5  (71.4%)  had  a  favorable  clinical  response.  In  the  piperacillin/tazobactam 
group, 4 of 5 (80.0%) patients with polymicrobial MRSA infection who had not received concomitant 
vancomycin had a favorable clinical response; of the 5 patients with polymicrobial infections who had 
received vancomycin, 3 (60.0%) had a favorable clinical response. 
All  11  patients  in  the  clinical  EPP  population  (6  in  the  ertapenem  group  and  5  in  the 
piperacillin/tazobactam  group)  with  MRSA  isolated  as  a  sole  baseline  pathogen  had  not  received 
vancomycin.  In the ertapenem group, 4 of 6 (66.7%) patients with monomicrobial MRSA infection 
who  had  not  received  concomitant  vancomycin  had  a  favorable  clinical  response.  In  the

piperacillin/tazobactam group, 3 of 5 (60.0%) patients with monomicrobial MRSA infection who had 
not received concomitant vancomycin had a favorable clinical response. 
For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the favorable clinical response rates were 15/18 isolates (83.3%) in the 
ertapenem group and 7/10 isolates (70.0%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group. The difference in the 
clinical response rates between the 2 treatment groups was 13.3% (95% CI:  -18.2, 48.7). In patients 
whose  culture  results  demonstrated  organisms  for  which  resistance  to  the  protocol-specified  switch 
agent amoxicillin/clavulanate was a concern, alternative oral antibacterial therapy was permitted. Six 
(6)  out  of  18  patients  (33.3%)  in  the  ertapenem  group  and  1  out  of  10  patients  (10%)  in  the

amoxicillin/clavulanate  and  an  antipseudomonal  oral agent  (ciprofloxacin  or  levofloxacin)  following 
parenteral therapy.  In patients who did not receive an antipseudomonal oral agent, 9 out of 12 patients 
(75.0%) in the ertapenem group had a favorable clinical response while 6 out of 9 patients (66.7%) in 
the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group  had  a  favorable  clinical  response.  The  clinical  response  rates  for

to 
Clinical  response  rates  for  MRSA,  enterococci  and  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  were  remarkably  high, 
completely independently of the addition or not of vancomycin for MRSA or enterococci, or the use of 
an  antipseudomonal  agent  during  the  switch  to  oral  therapy,  respectively.  Several  explanations  may 
account  for  the  higher  than  expected  favorable  clinical  response  rates  for  MRSA,  enterococci  and 
Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  in  this  study.    First,  factors  other  than  antibiotic  susceptibility  may  have 
influenced  the  clinical  response.    The  study  investigators  took  a  multi-disciplinary  approach 
incorporating  off-loading,  local  wound  care,  optimisation  of  glycemic  control,  and  surgical 
intervention (when necessary) in addition to antimicrobial therapy.  These factors were applied equally 
across  treatment  groups  and  without  knowledge  of  treatment  group  by  the  investigators.    Second, 
although MRSA, enterococci, and P. aeruginosa have all been implicated as pathogens in diabetic foot 
infections,  their  contribution  to  the  infectious  process  remains  a  topic  of  some  controversy.  Finally, 
another  contributing  factor,  particularly  in  patients  with  MRSA,  is  the  frequency  of  polymicrobial 
infections.  It is acknowledged that the adequacy of the chosen primary endpoint for DFI may still be 
open  to  discussion  and  that  improvement  may  be  eventually  possible,  particularly  with  regard  to 
clinical  variables  and  staging,  since  the  relevance  of  microbiologic  findings  may  be  more  open  to 
dispute.  Under  these  circumstances,  a  more  careful  choice  of  the  analyses  that  should  figure  in  the 
main dossier is warranted. 
Clinical efficacy Per pathogen (blood isolates only) 
To be included in this analysis, a clinically evaluable patient had to have a baseline pathogen isolated 
from blood. Bacteremia was uncommon in both treatment groups. One patient in the ertapenem group 
and  3  patients  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group  were  bacteremic  at  baseline.  One  baseline  blood 
isolate was identified from each patient. All of the isolates identified from blood were gram-positive 
aerobic  cocci.  None  of  the  patients  with  baseline  pathogens  isolated  from  blood  had  persistent 
bacteremia.  In  each  of  the  3  patients  with  positive  blood  cultures  at  baseline,  no  follow-up  cultures 
were considered necessary and the pathogens were presumed eradicated. The small number of isolates 
precluded meaningful comparison between the 2 treatment groups. 
Microbiological efficacy per patient 
For  this  analysis,  151  out  of  289  treated  patients  (52.2%)  in  the  ertapenem  group  were  FUA 
microbiologically evaluable and 135 out of 287 treated patients (47.0%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam 
group were FUA microbiologically evaluable.   
If  no  specimen  was  obtained  for  culture  at  a  follow-up  visit,  the  microbiological  outcome  was 
presumed  based  on  the  clinical  outcome;  eradication  was  presumed  for  favorable  clinical  outcomes 
and persistence was presumed for unfavorable clinical outcomes.  For a favorable overall per patient 
microbiological  response,  all  pathogens  identified  at  baseline  should  have  been  eradicated  or 
presumed to be eradicated.

Combined Clinical and Microbiological Efficacy  
The  proportion  of  FUA  microbiologically  evaluable  patients  with  both  a  favorable  clinical  and  a 
favorable  microbiological  response  assessment  was  evaluated  in  both  treatment  groups  at  the  FUA 
visit. 
If  both  the  clinical  assessment  and  the  overall  microbiological  assessment  were  “favourable,”  the 
patient  was  counted  as  “favourable”  for  this  analysis.  If  either  or  both  the  clinical  and  the 
microbiological  assessments  were  classified  as  “unfavourable,”  then  the  patient  was  counted  as 
“unfavourable” in the analysis. 
MITT population 
Analysis of the clinical response rates in the clinical MITT population was performed to support the 
primary  analyses  of  the  evaluable  population.  The  results  for  the  MITT  clinical  efficacy  were 
consistent  with  the  clinical  response  rates  in  the  clinically  evaluable  population  and  supported  the 
primary and secondary efficacy hypotheses and the results for the MITT microbiological efficacy were 
consistent with the microbiological response rates in the microbiologically evaluable population. 
Emergent Infections 
Emergent pathogens were pathogens that were not present at baseline, but were isolated from patients 
with clinical evidence of infection after study therapy had been initiated. Emergent pathogens isolated 
during study therapy were termed “superinfections.” Emergent pathogens isolated after study therapy 
was completed were termed “new infections.” 
One  patient  in  the  ertapenem  group  (AN  229)  and  one  patient  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group 
(AN  807)  developed  bacteremia  following  discontinuation  of  study  therapy.  Both  patients  grew  out 
methicillin-sensitive  S. aureus.  No  FUA  clinically  evaluable  patients  in  either  treatment  group  had 
persistence  of  baseline  pathogens  at  the  FUA  visit  due  to  the  development  of  resistance  to  study 
therapy. 
Overall, the most common emergent pathogens in the ertapenem treatment group were Enterococcus 
species  and  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa.  In  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  treatment  group,  the  most 
common  emergent  pathogen  was  S.  aureus.  The  incidence  of  new  and  superinfections  was  low  and 
appeared to be similar between the 2 treatment groups. 
Exploratory Analyses—Diabetic Foot Wound Score 
The clinical response assessment at DCIV and FUA was also analysed within each treatment group by 
baseline diabetic foot wound score, a composite score based on general wound parameters (signs and 
symptoms  of  infection)  and  wound  measurements.  Clinical  response  rates  were  similar  in  both 
treatment  groups  across  baseline  wound  scores  at  DCIV  and  FUA  and  the  response  rates  generally 
decreased with an increase in baseline wound score.   
(cid:131)  Conclusion on efficacy 
The  data  from  the  single  pivotal  study  034  does  not  support  the  claimed  proposed  indication 
Complicated  skin  and  soft  tissue  infection  (cSSTI),  including  diabetic  foot  infections.  It  may  only 
support the indication restricted to diabetic foot infections (DFI). 
To support its request for cSSTI, the MAH mentioned again an earlier study (protocol 016), where the 
efficacy of ertapenem, 1.0 g IV once daily was compared with piperacillin/tazobactam, 3.375 g every 
6  hours,  in  the  treatment  of  complicated  skin  and  skin  structure  infections,  defined  as  lower  limb 
infections  in  diabetics,  infected  pressure  sores,  deep  tissue  infections  in  which  enterobacteria  or 
anaerobes were likely or which required surgical drainage, extensive cellulititis, wound infections and 
perineal  abscesses.  In  study  016,  patients  were  stratified  at  baseline  according  to  the  presence  or 
absence  of  complicating  underlying  disease.  Stratum  I  consisted  of  those  with  decubitus  ulcers, 
diabetes  mellitus  or  other  neuropathic  conditions  whereas  Stratum  II  contained  all  other  patients.

Overall  60  %  of  patients  had  received  an  antimicrobial  agent  within  14  days  of  study  entry, 
predominantly  beta-lactam  compound.  Further  to  its  evaluation,  study  016  had  been  deemed 
unsuitable  for  granting  the  same  proposed  indication  in  the  original  Marketing  Authorisation 
Application (MAA). As already assessed in the original MAA, there were too many concerns with the 
overall efficacy results in Protocol 016 per se, even to grant a restricted indication of cSSTI excluding 
DFI.  
Protocol  034  provided  evidence  in  only  one  subgroup  of  infections  within  the  heterogenous  clinical 
condition of cSSTI, namely DFI. Therefore, it can only support an indication of DFI, as satisfactory 
efficacy  evidence  in  the  other  conditions  within  the  heterogenous  clinical  condition  of  cSSTI  is  not 
available. Given the heterogeneity of the two patient populations recruited into the two studies, it is 
considered that Protocol 034 does not provide the additional evidence required such that, together, the 
trials support the broad indication of cSSTI. 
2.2 
Clinical safety 
(cid:131)  Safety data from the main study: Protocole 034. 
Adverse experiences that occurred while the patient was on parenteral study therapy are more likely to 
be related to the parenteral study therapy than those occurring after the completion of the parenteral 
therapy  (i.e.,  during  oral  therapy  or  the  follow-up  period).    For  this  reason,  separate  analyses  are 
presented on adverse experiences that occurred specifically within the parenteral treatment period and 
on those that occurred during study therapy and the 14-day follow-up period (i.e., parenteral and oral 
antibiotic therapy and the 14-day follow-up period). 
Patient exposure 
Adverse experiences were recorded during parenteral and oral study therapy and for 14 days after the 
last dose of study therapy (safety follow-up period).  Of the 639 patients enrolled, 576 received at least 
1 dose of parenteral study therapy (289 in the ertapenem group and 287 in the piperacillin/tazobactam 
group)  and  are  included  in  the  analysis  of  adverse  experiences.  Ten  (10)  patients  (ANs  0232,  0235, 
0236,  0313,  0773,  and  1055  in  the  ertapenem  treatment  group  and  419,  471,  488,  and  683  in  the 
piperacillin/tazobactam  group)  were  randomised    but  did  not  receive  any  study  medication.  These 
patients were excluded from the safety analyses. 
Patients in the ertapenem group received up to 33 days of therapy with a mean duration for any dose 
of 10.6 days.  Patients in the piperacillin/tazobactam group received up to 30 days of therapy with a 
mean duration of 11.0 days.

Data Source: [4.2.1; 4.3.11] 
Overall,  273  out  of  576  treated  patients  (47.4%)  had  clinical  adverse  experiences  reported  during 
parenteral  therapy.  One  patient  in  the  ertapenem  group  (AN  0715)  experienced  a  serious  adverse 
experience of positive blood culture that began on the first day of study therapy but prior to the first 
dose.  The  patient  discontinued  from  parenteral  therapy  on  Study  Day  2.  The  investigator  did  not 
consider the positive blood culture related to study therapy. Because the onset of the serious adverse 
experience occurred prior to initiation of study therapy, this patient is not included in the number of 
patients  with  clinical  adverse  experiences  during  parenteral  therapy,  serious  clinical  adverse 
experiences,  clinical  adverse  experiences  leading  to  discontinuation,  or  serious  clinical  adverse 
experiences  leading  to  discontinuation  during  parenteral  therapy  or  during  the  study  therapy  and

in 
Clinical  adverse  experiences  occurring  in  5%  or  more  of  patients  in  either  treatment  group  were 
defined as frequently occurring clinical adverse experiences.  The frequently occurring clinical adverse 
events were: diarrhoea, nausea and headache. 
The  most  common  adverse  experiences  with  an  incidence  ≥3%  were  gastrointestinal  disorders, 
general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions,  and  nervous  system  disorders.  The 
incidence of clinical adverse experiences was similar between the 2 treatment groups.   
There are no apparent differences between the 2 treatment groups for these adverse experiences with 
the exception of diarrhea. During parenteral therapy, diarrhea was reported by 24 patients (8.3%) in 
the ertapenem group and 41 patients (14.3%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group. The results suggest 
that ertapenem may have a lower incidence of diarrhea than piperacillin/tazobactam.  
The  most  common  drug-related  clinical  adverse  experiences  with  an  incidence ≥1%  were 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (9.7%  of  patients  in  the  ertapenem  group  and  13.2%  in  the  piperacillin 
group) and general disorders and administration site conditions (1.7% of patients in the ertapenem

Data Source:  [4.2.1; 4.3.11] 
Overall, 331 out of 576 treated patients (57.5%) had clinical adverse experiences reported during study 
therapy and 14-day follow-up period. The incidence of clinical adverse experiences, including serious 
adverse  experiences,  deaths,  drug-related  adverse  experiences,  and  discontinuations  due  to  adverse 
experiences,  was  similar  in  the 2  treatment  groups.  There  was  1  patient  in  the  ertapenem  group  and  
1  patient  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group  who  had  serious  drug-related  clinical  adverse 
experiences reported during study therapy and the 14-day follow-up period.   
The  most  common  clinical  adverse  experiences  with  an  incidence  ≥3%  were  gastrointestinal 
disorders (23.5% of patients in the ertapenem group and 30.0% in the piperacillin/tazobactam group), 
infections (16.3% of patients in the ertapenem group and 15.3% in the piperacillin/tazobactam group), 
and general disorders and administration site conditions (11.8% of patients in the ertapenem group 
and 18.8% .in the piperacillin/tazobactam group). The incidence of clinical adverse experiences was 
similar between the two treatment groups.   
The  most  common  medictation-related  clinical  adverse  experiences  with  an  incidence  ≥1%  were 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (11.1%  of  patients  in  the  ertapenem  group  and  16.0%  in  the 
piperacillin/tazobactam group) and infections (3.5% of patients in the ertapenem group and 2.4% in

One patient in each treatment group died during the parenteral therapy period. One patient (AN 0832 
an 84 year old male) in the ertapenem treatment group had an adverse experience of pneumonia during 
the  parenteral  therapy  period  due  to  lung  cancer  diagnosed  during  the  follow-up  period.  The  patient 
died  during  the  follow-up  period.  The  death  was  not  considered  to  be  related  to  study  therapy.  One 
patient  (AN  1009  a  73  year  old  male)  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group  died  due  to  myocardial 
infarction  during  the  parenteral  therapy  period.  The  death  was  not  considered  to  be  related  to  study 
drug.   
Four  (4)  patients  in  the  ertapenem  group  and  one  patient  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group 
experienced adverse experiences resulting in death after parenteral therapy but while on oral antibiotic 
therapy  or  during  the  14  day  follow-up  period  following  study  therapy.  None  of  these  deaths  were 
considered to be drug related.

Data Source:  [4.2.1; 4.3.11] 
Five hundred forty-five (545) of the 576 treated patients had at least 1 laboratory test post baseline.  
Eighty-three (83) of these had laboratory adverse experiences, 32 (11.8%) in the ertapenem group and 
51 (18.7%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group. There were 2 patients with serious laboratory adverse 
experiences, both in the ertapenem group. Neither of these serious adverse experiences was considered 
drug  related  and  neither  resulted  in  discontinuation  from  study  therapy.  Two  (2)  patients  in  the 
piperacillin/tazobactam group were discontinued due to drug-related laboratory adverse experiences. 
During parenteral therapy the most common laboratory adverse experiences in both treatment groups 
with an incidence ≥3% were increases in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood glucose. 
Medication-related laboratory adverse experiences with an incidence ≥1% were generally uncommon 
in  both  treatment  groups.  The  most  common  drug-related  laboratory  adverse  experiences  during

Two  patients  (0.7%)  in  the  ertapenem  group  had  serious  laboratory  adverse  experiences  during 
parenteral  therapy  that  were  not  considered  medication-related.  No  serious  laboratory  adverse 
experiences occurred in the piperacillin/tazobactam group. AN 0484 had increased blood glucose and 
decreased blood potassium reported as serious laboratory adverse experiences. AN 0944 had increased 
blood potassium reported as a serious laboratory adverse experience. 
There  was  a  decreased  relative  risk  of  medication-related  laboratory  adverse  experiences  in  the 
ertapenem  group  compared  with  piperacillin/tazobactam.  The  2  treatment  groups  were  not 
significantly  different  with  respect  to  discontinuations  due  to  medication-related  laboratory  adverse 
experiences.  No  serious  medication-related  adverse  experiences  were  observed  in  either  treatment 
group. 
One  patient  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group  (AN  0298)  experienced  a  serious  clinical  adverse 
experience  of  hypoglycemic  seizure  that  was  definitely  not  related  to  study  therapy.  Of  note,  there 
were no seizures reported in any patient who received ertapenem in the study. There were no adverse 
experiences of seizure in either treatment group during the 14-day follow-up period.

Data Source:  [4.2.1; 4.3.11] 
The most common laboratory adverse experiences during study therapy and 14-day follow-up period 
with  an  incidence  ≥3  %  were  increases  in  C-reactive  protein  (CRP),  blood  glucose,  aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. 
When the MAH applied for this extension of indication, he proposed to include C-reactive protein and 
decrease in blood sodium in section 4.8 of the SPC.

As the number of cases of decrease in blood sodium and increase in C-reactive protein reported during 
study  034  was  limited,  a  detailed  cumulative  safety  review  from  post-marketing  data  of  cases  of 
decrease  in  blood  sodium  and  increase  in  C-reactive  protein  were  requested  by  the  CHMP  before 
concluding on the addition of these 2 events in the SPC. 
The  review  performed  by  the  MAH  from  30.03.2001  to  22.06.2005  identified  4  reports  of 
hyponatremia received from inception to 22.06.2005, which did not provide substantial information to 
infer more than a temporal relationship of ertapenem with hyponatremia and no report with increase of 
c-protein reactive. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that this cumulative safety review has not detected 
any signals associated for either of the 2 events. Furthermore the rise in the CRP is often seen after 
onset  of  antibiotic  therapy  in  patients  with  bacterial  infections  (particularly  those  with  chronic 
disease),  the  CHMP  requested  information  on  the  temporal  characteristics  of  the  rise  and  fall  of  the 
CRP for study 034. In the answer from the MAH, all reports of medication-related C-reactive protein 
elevations  were  from  a  single  clinical  site  in  the  study.  The  assessment  of  these  elevations  in  C-
reactive  protein  as  medication-related  non-serious  adverse  experiences  is  not  representative  of  the 
experience of other clinical sites in the study. It is most likely that the CRP increases observed in these 
patients are attributable to an acute phase reaction in response to infection or ongoing inflammation.  
Further  to  the  evaluation  of  the  submitted  data,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  there  was  no  signal 
requiring the addition of C-reactive protein and decrease in blood sodium in section 4.8 of the 
SPC. 
The most common medication-related laboratory adverse experiences during study therapy and 14-day 
follow-up period with an incidence ≥1% were increases in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and liver 
transaminases (ALT and AST).  The incidence of medication-related laboratory adverse experiences 
appeared similar to that seen during the parenteral therapy period.

Conclusion on laboratory findings 
Laboratory  abnormalities  are  common  in  patients  with  acute  bacterial  infections.  In  addition  to 
reviewing investigator-reported laboratory adverse experiences, assessment of the relative laboratory 
safety  of  each  treatment  group  was  accomplished  by  predefining  clinically  significant  laboratory 
abnormalities (CSLAs) for specified tests and then identifying patients whose worst laboratory value 
represented  a  worsening  from  baseline  and  met  the  criteria  for  a  CSLA.  The  combination  of  these  
2  approaches  to  the  analysis  of  laboratory  abnormalities  provides  a  more  complete  overview  of  the 
profile of laboratory safety. 
The  most  common  CSLAs  in  both  the  parenteral  therapy  period  and  the  study  therapy  and  14-day 
follow-up period were elevated serum creatinine and decreased absolute neutrophil count (ANC).  
As  expected  in  a  diabetic  population,  many  patients  in  the  treated  population  had  pre-existing  renal 
disorders such as diabetic nephropathy (5.4%) and renal insufficiency (6.1%). Overall, the proportion 
of patients with CSLAs was low and generally similar between the 2 treatment groups. The proportion 
of patients with CSLAs in the study therapy and 14-day follow-up period was similar to that seen in 
the  parenteral  therapy  period.  Very  few  patients  treated  with  ertapenem  had  a  creatinine  clearance 
(CrCl) level ≤30 ml/min/1.73 m2. An analysis of the clinical and laboratory AE profile using a CrCl 
level  of  60 ml/min/1.73  m2  as  the  cut-off  point  for  renal  dysfunction  showed  no  substantive 
differences between patients with CrCl ≤60 and those with CrCl >60. Given the relatively few patients 
in the analyses, however, detailed comparison between the 2 populations (CrCl ≤60 and CrCl >60) is 
limited.    Overall,  the  2  populations  appear  generally  similar  and  the  adverse  event  profile  in  these 
patients was generally similar to that which appears presently in the EU SPC. Although the fact that 
the  data  is  scarce  does  not  warrant  any  specific  amendment  to  the  product’s  literature  regarding 
patients with renal insufficiency.

(cid:131)  Conclusion on safety 
The frequently occurring clinical adverse events during parental therapy were: diarrhea, nausea and 
headache. 
None of the deaths occurring during the parenteral therapy period or after parenteral therapy but while 
on  oral  antibiotic  therapy  or  during  the  14  day  follow-up  period  following  study  therapy,  were 
considered to be medication related. 
The most common clinically significant laboratory abnormalities in both the parenteral therapy period 
and  the  study  therapy  and 14-day  follow-up  period  were elevated  serum  creatinine  and  decreased 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC).   
With respect to the above data revealed in the responses on C-reactive protein and blood sodium, the 
addition of elevations in C-reactive protein and decreases in  blood sodium was not supported by 
the CHMP. 
Further to the assessment of the data submitted, no major new safety issues have been identified that 
needed to be added to the SPC.

Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment 
Protocol  034  provided  evidence  in  only  one  subgroup  of  infections  within  the  heterogenous  clinical 
condition of cSSTI, namely DFI. Therefore, it can only support an indication of DFI, as satisfactory 
efficacy  evidence  in  the  other  conditions  within  the  heterogenous  clinical  condition  of  cSSTI  is  not 
available.  
Further to the assessment of the data submitted, no major new safety issues have been identified. With 
respect  to  the  above  data  revealed  in  the  responses  on  C-reactive  protein  and  blood  sodium,  the 
addition of elevations in C-reactive protein and decreases in blood sodium was not supported by the 
CHMP. 
The overall benefit-risk assessment is then negative for an extension of the therapeutic indication to 
the use in Invanz to complicated skin and soft tissue infection, including diabetic foot infections, but 
positive for the restricted indication of diabetic foot infections only.

Changes to the Product Information 
- 
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indications” of the SPC 
A fourth bullet point has been added to as follows: 
•  Diabetic foot infections of the skin and soft tissue (see section 4.4). 
- 
Section 4.4 “Special warnings and special precautions for use” of the SPC 
The following statement has been added: 
Efficacy of ertapenem in the treatment of diabetic foot infections with concurrent osteomyelitis has not 
been established. 
- 
Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” of the SPC 
This  section  has  been  rearranged  to  allow  for  a  better  overview  of  data  belonging  to  different  age 
groups.

In order to have this section up-to-date with regard to the EME/QRD template and SCP guideline, the 
post-marketing  reported  adverse  reactions  Very  rare  =  <  1/10,000  has  been  moved  to  the  table  of 
adverses reactions instead of being in a separate paragraph. 
Therefore,  
Very rare: anaphylaxis including anaphylactoid reactions has been moved to Immune system 
disorders, 
Very rare: hallucinations has been moved to Nervous system disorders.

Section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties” of the SPC 
The  full  section  has  been  updated  to  be  in  accordance  with  the  current  Note  for  Guidance  on 
Evaluation of Medicinal Products indicated for Treatment of Bacterial Infections (CPMP/EWP/558/95 
adopted April 2004). This update was the subject of questions in the RSI adopted in June 2005 and the 
RSI  adopted  in  October  2005.  The  table  presented  in  this  section  5.1  does  now  follow  the  Section 
V.4.2. Format for section 5.1 (page 20 of 23) of the above-mentioned Nfg, where it is stated that the 
relevant  pathogens  related  to  the  requested  indications  should  be  categorised  under  the  3  headings 
given in the guideline: “Commonly susceptible species”, “Species for which acquired resistance may 
be a problem” and “Inherently resistant organisms.” 
Further to assessment of pre-clinical studies, the PK/PD relationship has been added to this section and 
should now read: 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship 
Similar  to  other  beta-lactam  antimicrobial  agents,  the  time  that  the  plasma  concentration  of 
ertapenem exceeds the MIC of the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in 
pre-clinical PK/PD studies. 
Additionally the description of the mechanisms of resistance has been revised to include more detail 
further to the request from the CHMP in its RSI adopted in October 2005, and replace the previous 2 
paragraphs on Resistance. It should be read: 
Mechanism of Resistance 
For species considered susceptible to ertapenem, resistance was uncommon in surveillance studies in 
Europe.  In  resistant  isolates,  resistance  to  other  antibacterial  agents  of  the  carbapenem  class  was 
seen in some but not all isolates. Ertapenem is effectively stable to hydrolysis by most classes of beta-
lactamases,  including  penicillinases,  cephalosporinases  and  extended  spectrum  beta-lactamases,  but 
not metallo-beta-lactamases.  
Methicillin-resistant  staphylococci  and  enterococci  are  resistant  to  ertapenem,  owing  to  PBP  target 
insensitivity;  P.  aeruginosa  and  other  non-fermentative  bacteria  are  generally  resistant,  probably 
owing to limited penetration and to active efflux. 
Resistance  is  uncommon  in  Enterobacteriaceae  and  the  drug  is  generally  active  against  those  with 
extended-spectrum  beta-lactamases  (ESBLs).  Resistance  can  however  be  observed  when  ESBLs  or 
other potent beta-lactamases (e.g. AmpC types) are present in conjunction with reduced permeability, 
arising by the loss of one or more outer membrane porins, or with up-regulated efflux. Resistance can 
also arise via the acquisition of betalactamases with significant carbapenem-hydrolysing activity (e.g. 
IMP and VIM metallo-beta-lactamases or KPC types), though these are rare. 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  ertapenem  differs  from  that  of  other  classes  of  antibiotics,  such  as 
quinolones, aminoglycosides, macrolides and tetracyclines. There is no target-based cross-resistance 
between ertapenem and these substances. However, micro-organisms may exhibit resistance to more 
than  one  class  of  antibacterial  agents  when  the  mechanism  is,  or  includes,  impermeability  to  some 
compounds and/or an efflux pump. 
The MAH commits to implement appropriate studies in the post-marketing period to collect data on 
the prevalence of resistance, both within Europe and in the rest of the world, to enable the updating of

the SPC whenever the resistance patterns change. These worldwide resistance surveillance studies are 
currently  ongoing.  In  accordance  with  CPMP  Guidance  Document  CPMP/EWP/520/96  (18  June, 
1997),  “Note  for  guidance  on  the  pharmacodynamic  section  of  the  SPC  for  anti-bacterial  medicinal 
products”, the prevalence of resistance information in the Section 5.1 of the SPC will be updated at the 
5-year  periodic  update.  This  periodic  update  coincides  with  the  registration  renewal  submission, 
scheduled for October 2006.

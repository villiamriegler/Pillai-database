non-clinical information based on final results from 
study ALN-GO1; this is a 105-week s.c. 
Section 5.3 of the SmPC was amended to remove 
information on carcinogenicity studies. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

(ALN-GO1-005): A single arm study to evaluate 
efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and 
pharmacodynamics of lumasiran in patients with 
advanced primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) and, in 
additon, based on available long-term efficacy and 
safety data from ongoing phase 3 studies ALN-GO1-
003 in PH1 patients >6 years old and ALN-GO1-004 
in PH1 patients <6 years old, and open-label 
extension study ALN-GO1-002. The Package Leaflet

There was no evidence of an increased incidence of 
the non-clinical information based on the final results 
from the 26-week GLP carcinogenicity study of 
lumasiran by s.c. injection in TgRasH2 mice, as 
agreed as part of protocol assistance 
(EMEA/H/SA/4014/2/2019/PA/PR/I). In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
neoplasia in the transgenic Tg-rasH2 mouse following 
repeated monthly administration of lumasiran for 26 weeks 
at doses of 150, 500 or 1500 mg/kg.
